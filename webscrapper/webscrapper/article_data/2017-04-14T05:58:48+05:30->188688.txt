AHMEDABAD: The talks between   and the workers of its car manufacturing plant in   remained inconclusive on Thursday, as the parties failed to reach a consensus over wage revision. 

 Meanwhile, the deputy labour commissioner’s office has scheduled the next hearing on May 4, 2017.
 
 “The meeting called on April 13 remained inconclusive as no consensus was arrived at. The workmen put their wage hike demand for the year 2015 and 2016. However, they have not yet come up with their salary hike they demand for the period from 2017 to 2019,” said senior labour commissionerate officials in Ahmedabad.
 
 According to a   spokesperson, the workers’ union again did not submit the justification for their demands to the conciliation officer during a meeting with the deputy labour commissioner office.
 
 “Given the seriousness of the case, the labour authorities have admitted the matter for conciliation and have scheduled the next hearing after 21 days, on May 4, 2017. We continue to be in talks with union representatives, but they are adamant on their unreasonable demands,” the spokesperson added.
 
 Last month, a section of workers at the Sanand plant had sought the state labour authority’s intervention to resolve their issues including wage revision.
