SURAT:   declared its support on Friday for the ongoing agitation by parents against high fees taken by schools in Surat.   Pradesh Congress president   paid a visit to fasting parents below Anuvrat Dwar near City Light. He told them that his party would raise the issue on the floor of Gujarat assembly. 

 Chavda said, “The   government is deaf, dumb and blind. They did all this for votes in the last assembly elections. BJP supported parents first and once it got their votes, it went to school managements for the notes.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the parents have got permission from the police to continue their agitation programme at the spot until April 25. A parent of a student of   Jitendra Surana said, “We have got permission to continue with our programme until April 25. We will hold a big programme on Sunday.” He also claimed support of a number of non-governmental organizations to their cause. 
 
 Parents want reduction in fees of private schools and regular auditing of their accounts.
