AHMEDABAD: After hearing stories of grit and hard work of women employed in different unorganized sectors, ‘Raees’ superstar   saluted them saying that Ahmedabad’s women have made him believe that indeed “Koi dhandha chhota nahi hota”.

  SRK met women workers of Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa) here on Wednesday for a `Dialogue with grassroots managers, entrepreneurs and collective enterprises'.
 
 Shabnam, a tailor, recalled how she had never stepped out of her house but after joining Sewa did survey of workers in 36 areas and even went to Germany. “I started small, sewing clothes to keep the hearth going at home,” Shabnam said. 
 
 Mayaben, who has studied only up to class VII, narrated how she had overcome her fear and learnt computers to become a trainer herself! “Women like you remind me of my mother who toiled hard despite my father's illness to shelter me from life's struggles. In fact, women, including my wife, sister and now daughter have ensured there is no struggle in my life,” said SRK who was gifted a handcrafted wall piece of Sewa’s handicraft brand, Hansiba.
