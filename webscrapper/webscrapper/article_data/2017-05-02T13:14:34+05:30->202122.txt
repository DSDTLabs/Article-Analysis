Actress   says she really liked her bowl-shaped haircut. The 31-year-old actress says a lot of people hated her hairstyle but she grew fonder of it the more people criticised it.

  
  
 "Everybody hated it! I loved it! I loved it even more when people hated it. That was also pre-me even knowing how to do my own make-up," Rose says. However, the one look she regretted was when she attempted to go blonde in 2009. 
 
 "(I) got all chemical burns and terrible fringe," she adds. Rose has a short black pixie cut now, but says she was frightened about it at first. 
 
 "I love this look. It was daring and I was a little bit frightened, but I have an amazing make-up artist and hair team. I remember being like, 'I don't know if I can get away with this,' and with the lip being such a bold statement and the eye being so understated," she says.
