KOLAR: A major fire broke out at a   in the   in Kolar on Thursday at 10am, causing a loss of nearly Rs 10 crore. There were no casualties.

 Fire personnel had a tough time as flames engulfed the entire structure of Banashankari Chemicals Private Limited; barrels of oil were stored in its warehouse. The fire spread to neighbouring factories too. Employees working in these buildings were rushed to safety.
 
 A short circuit is suspected to have triggered the fire.
 
 Kolar district fire officer Raghavendra said 25 fire tenders from Bengaluru and Kolar were pressed into service. “It took over six hours to douse the flames. There were over 3,000 barrels of oil and chemicals stored in the factory. Thick smoke emanating from the building made things worse. We suspect short circuit caused the accident, though the possibility of a chemical reaction cannot be ruled out,” he said.
 
 Mani, a security guard, said there were nine workers in the factory when the accident occurred. “Initially, they tried to bring the situation under control with the help of fire extinguishing tools available in the factory. When their efforts went in vain, they alerted the fire station,” he added.
 
 The factory, owned by G N Murthy of Nelamangala, has been manufacturing thinners for the past 15 years, said P Mahendra, secretary of the company.
