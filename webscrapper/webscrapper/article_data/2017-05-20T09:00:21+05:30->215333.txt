CHENNAI:   and revenue officials seized close to 140kg of stale food, including  , expired ice-cream and soft drinks, from stalls on   on Friday. 

 Based on a series of complaints, the department with the district administration raided around 300 stalls along a 3km stretch from   to Light House. The shops were checked for adulteration, expired products, unauthorised addition of food colours and personal hygiene of food handlers. Ten teams of officials were mobilised for the drive.
 
 Officials seized 100kg of decayed fruits, 24kg of rotten fish and 7kg of expired ice-cream and biscuits. In addition, they also took away 40 litres of expired soft drinks and 31 litres of reused oil.  , designated officer, Tamil Nadu food safety and drug administration department, said no vendor was penalised. "We realised that many of them weren't aware of food safety practices. We advised them and let them off with a warning," he said. 
 
 During inspection the teams also came across tobacco products being sold, and they seized 3kg of the banned substances. They also seized 4kg of food colours.
 
 Officials estimate the total worth of the seized food to be around 30,000. They will be taken to one of Chennai Corporation's landfills, an official said, adding there will be more such inspections in the coming weeks.
 
  Although these vendors can be penalised under the Food Safety and Standrads Act, 2006, which can invite a fine of up to 25,000, officials say it is hard to drag mobile vendors to courts. "Many of them don't even own the pushcarts they operate with. And it's hard to trace them," said a revenue officer. "But food safety officials can collect spot fines if they find the same errant vendor the next time," he said. 
 
 The Chennai Corporation has enumerated nearly 1,500 hawkers on Marina beach. For any food related complainants WhatsApp to 94440 42322.
