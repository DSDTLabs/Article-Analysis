The   star shared a hilarious snap of daughter North lounging in her own mini-spa in the bathroom after she got in trouble for misbehaving.
 
  Sharing the picture on Instagram, Kim said "That time North gets a time out & is a little too quiet... I go in her room to check on her & she's in the bathroom, made her own spa & tells me she's chilling out 😂"
  
  
  
  
  North has draped some toilet tissues over her eyes and covered up with a towel in her make-shift spa in the family bathroom.
  
  
 
  
  With her purple teddy beside her, Kim and Kanye’s daughter was indulging in some much needed rest and relaxation.
  
  Kim and Kanye, who are also parents to one-year-old Saint, recently launched their own childrenswear line and said North was their “muse” when designing the collection.
