BENGALURU: Indian ace   didn't waste time getting into the groove after arriving in the city for the   clash against Uzbekistan. The seasoned campaigner, who landed late on Tuesday, showed he was ready for the challenge, should he be required, with a double training session on Wednesday. After working with team coach   and a couple of local juniors in the morning, the 43-year-old veteran of 55 ties in the competition slugged it out under lights with fellow reserve   and youngster Sriram Balaji. Balaji was the common factor - perhaps the strongest indication that he is a certainty among the trio to make the playing team - as he teamed up with Bopanna for a bit of two-on-one tennis against Paes before pairing up with the Kolkatan.

 India's non-playing captain  , who has stressed that he would go into the tie over the weekend with three singles players and one doubles specialist, indicated nothing was decided yet. "I'm seeing Leander for the first time today, so let's see how it goes," he said. Asked about his first impressions, Paes' former partner said: "He looks fresh, looks good. We're going to play some sets so we'll see."
 
 Bhupathi suggested that the fact Paes last played Â­ and won the title -in Leon, Mexico, where conditions are similar to the city thanks to the altitude was an advantage. "That definitely helps," he said.
 
 However, Uzbekistan's senior pro Farrukh Dustov felt Paes would be a part of the   I, second round tie. "I personally think he will play," the 30-year-old told TOI. "Why would he take the trouble of coming here otherwise. We will be prepared," he said. The mystery will end during the draw ceremony on Thursday morning.
