NEW DELHI: Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader   on Friday said that Governor Ch   Rao should ask AIADMK general secretary VK   to form government in  .

 He also said that if the caretaker chief minister   withdraws his resignation, it will be like putting the toothpaste back in the tube.
 
 "Pannerselvam didn't give any list of lawmakers who are supporting him. He didn't stake any claim. He just wants his resignation to be withdrawn. But, it has already been accepted. How can he do this? It's like putting toothpaste back in the tube," Swamy was quoted as saying by ANI.
 
 
  Taking a jibe at the governor he said, "So, if the governor has any chance, and he has woken up to his duties as a constitutional authority, he should ask Sasikala to form a government and then move a resolution in the assembly for confidence vote and proceed from there."
 
 "There is now nothing left. Had Pannerselvam produced a list, there would have been a question over which list to accept. If the governor now doesn't call Sasikala, it would mean he is playing politics and he deserves to be removed," he added.
 
 On Thursday, Sasikala met Governor Vidyasagar Rao and handed him the letters of support given by her party legislators.
