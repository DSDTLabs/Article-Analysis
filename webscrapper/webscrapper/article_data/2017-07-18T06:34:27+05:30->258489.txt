AHMEDABAD: Many Amadavdis today wonder about the etymology of place names located within the walled city and in its immediate suburbs. In early days of Ahmedabad places were usually named after important nobles of the sultanate period in the 15th century. Though some of these names exist today, many exist only on old survey records. 

 In a book ‘A Quest for Truth’ – a collection of essays and research papers by former director Epigraphy of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Dr Z A Desai, a detailed description of the etymology of place names has been mentioned.
 
 For instance Desai mentions that Fatehpura on way to Sarkhej and the Sarangpur area in the walled city to have been established by   of the sultanate period. 
 
 Interestingly, today’s Navrangpura was called Shaikhpur in the 15th century while Mithakali was Mithapur. Areas like Aliampur, Isanpur, Mithapur were considered the most beautiful suburbs of Ahmedabad with trees and gardens. 
 
 Kalupur was established by a noble called Malik Kalu. Another area in the suburb, called Hajipur, was settled by a noble called Malik Haji. 
 
 Desai has referred extensively to the Mirat-e Ahmadi while mentioning that there existed residential quarters of important personages in the 15th century Ahmedabad, whose traces are nowhere to be seen.
 
 “There was a haveli of  , which was just situated outside the Bhadra fort and was quite a remarkable and was situated in today’s Kharu ka Nala area in the walled city. Another famous residential building belonged to Alalm Khan, which was situated just outside the city walls between Jamalpur and Astodia gates. 
 
 This is not all, Desai’s works also mention the previous names of important districts in Gujarat today. For instance, Junagadh was called Mustafabad, Champaner was called Muhammadabad, modern day Himmatnagar was called Ahmadnagar and a flourishing town called Daulatabad existed near
