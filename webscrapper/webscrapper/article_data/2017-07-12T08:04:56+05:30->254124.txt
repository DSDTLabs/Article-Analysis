CHANDIGARH: After the first day’s hiccups, the   organisers at the Sector-10 DAV   made extra arrangements on Tuesday to give the candidates for the BSc-medical seats a better experience.

 At the entrance to the main venue, extra   prevented a Monday-like chaos when representatives of student parties had gatecrashed the centralised admission session and crammed the auditorium passage. On Tuesday, barricades regulated entry and exit. “There faced no problem in getting my documents verified,” candidate Rajat said.
 
 A   addressed queries related to the merit list and the counselling procedure. Projecting the merit list to a giant screen and announcing the candidate’s name as it appeared on the display kept the student-counsellor communication going. A lack of display on the first day had kept the candidates clueless about the counselling schedule and merit list. “The projector system made it easy for us to check out our name,” candidate Simranjeet said.
 
 A room with “medical facilities” banner hanging over was found locked. Asked if medical help was available, college student Harish said: “We don’t have the facility as such.” Bottled mineral water and water coolers were kept at the venue but the water distribution at the auditorium gate was haphazard. The centralised   for the general pool (15% outside quota) went on from 10am to 1pm. The intake for the UT pool’s 85% quota was from 1pm to 4pm.
 
 The parents accompanying the candidates found the second day’s procedure less cumbersome. “Since the candidates had to fill only one detailed form, gone is the confusion of filing it every individual college,” said Brijesh Sharma, father of a candidate.
