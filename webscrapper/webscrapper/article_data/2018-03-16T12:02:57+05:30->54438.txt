PATNA:   Giriraj Singh on Thursday stirred a fresh controversy when he said the victory of RJD candidate Sarfaraz Alam in   Lok Sabha byelection would make the place a “hub of terrorism”. “RJD has given a fillip to the extremist ideology in the constituency which shares border with Nepal. It will be a threat to not only Bihar, but the entire country,” Singh said in New Delhi.

 Singh’s statement came less than a week after state BJP chief Nityanand Rai’s remark at an election rally that Araria will become an “ISI den” if RJD wins from there. An FIR had been lodged against Rai for allegedly violating model of conduct by making the controversial statement.
 
 The bypolls to Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad and Bhabua assembly constituencies were held on March 11. While the RJD registered emphatic victories in Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad assembly seats, the BJP succeeded in retaining Bhabhua assembly seat.
 
 Singh’s remark on Thursday drew sharp criticism from RJD and its allies.
 
 Former CM and HAM-S chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, whose party recently switched over from NDA to the Grand Alliance, said, “The government should take steps to avoid any untoward incident in Araria, where not only Muslims but people from scheduled caste and other sections of the society also live. How can Araria become the hub of terrorists?”
 
 RJD national vice-president Rabri Devi too lashed out at the BJP and termed it a party of terrorists. “All the terrorists of the country are sitting in the BJP’s office. The people have spoken and that’s why they are bewildered,” she said.
 
 Rabri’s son and leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav tweeted, “This man is a central minister and unfortunately he is not aware that it’s his government in Bihar and Delhi. If he and the BJP don't believe in Nitish Kumar's leadership, then why don't they ask him to step down or withdraw support. Such a shame for Nitish Kumar (sic).”
