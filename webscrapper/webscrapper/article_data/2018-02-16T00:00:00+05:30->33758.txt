Rain or shine, it’s a must for these peeps to party on a Saturday night. It wasn’t any different last weekend. They wanted to live it up and forget the weekday blues. The gals were dressed to kill and grabbed the attention of photogs. And those like   and   gave them animated poses. 

 Suman, too, turned several heads, sporting a figure-hugging dress and a plaid shirt tied around her waist.   and   enjoyed each other’s company. They were all smiles as the photogs zoomed their cameras in on them. As music pumped up the party mood, the freestylers got on the dance floor and grooved to the numbers with much zeal.
