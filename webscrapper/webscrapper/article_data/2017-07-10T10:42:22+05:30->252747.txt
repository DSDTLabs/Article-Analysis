KOZHIKODE:  , the man most expats in the  , irrespective of nationality or religion, invariably turn to when someone dies and the body needs to be sent back home, flew down here to personally intercede with officials over a controversial circular issued by   international airport mandating 48-hour prior intimation and permission before bringing a body.

 Calling the circular “impractical and morally and ethically wrong”, Ashraf said that submitting the embalming certificate to Indian airport authorities along with death certificate and   from the Indian high commission 48 hours before the actual arrival of a body is impossible.
 
 "The embalming centres in UAE and elsewhere would provide a certificate only on showing the air ticket to repatriate the body. Once the embalming certificate is issued then we have to straight away take the body to the airport. Who will give space to keep the body further for 48 hours? It will also put the bereaving families and kin of the deceased to untold misery and delay," he told TOI.
 
 Over the last 17 years, 42- year-old Ashraf, hailing from Thamarassery in   district, has helped repatriate around 4,500 dead bodies from UAE to 38 countries worldwide and was honoured with the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman in 2015 for his service.
 
 Ashraf, along with representatives of various expat organisations, met Karipur airport health officer on Sunday, who promised that there won’t be any delays from his end and that a final decision in this regard will be taken at a meeting convened by the airport director on Monday.
