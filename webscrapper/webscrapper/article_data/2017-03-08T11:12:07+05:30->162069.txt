BHUBANESWAR: The natives of   in  , where a   on February 28 has created  , on Tuesday forced two   probing the death to write down their findings and show it to them. 

 The suicide has created sharp political reactions after agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy's statement in the assembly on March 4 blamed marital discord between farmer Khainu (Hadu) Bagarti and his wife Kala behind Hadus suicide, a fact contradicted by Kala. Following sharp political reactions, Maharathy ordered a fresh probe into the death citing that his statement was on the basis of an inquiry report filed by the Bargarh district collector.
 
 The two officers, deputy director agriculture Naba Kishore Das and assistant director horticulture Sushil Seth visited Kenpali for the second probe into the suicide. Sources said the villagers gathered around them and insisted them to make their findings public. 
 
 A copy of the report, purportedly signed by the two officers, showed Hadu suffered damage of vegetables (cabbage, onion and chilli), paddy. He could not sell cabbage due to underrate while could not water his farm properly because of erratic water supply.
 
 "We visited Hadu's farm land. We are providing the below mentioned report to the villagers, the two officers wrote". Das, when contacted, said, "We have nothing to hide. We showed our findings to the villagers as they wished".
 
 The BJP, which had called a state-wide agitation on Tuesday, seeking Maharathy's resignation over the issue deferred it by a day owing to day-long mourning in the state following the demise of former Lok Sabha speaker Rabi Ray. "We will hold our protest on Wednesday," said BJP state vice-president Sameer Mohanty. Irrespective of the BJPs decision at the state-level, certain district units such as in Bargarh and Keonjhar, went ahead with their protest against Maharathy on Tuesday itself.
