NEW DELHI: The   has stayed a Rs 6,000-fine imposed by   administration on a student who had accused an associate dean of sexually harassing her. The student who had filed a police complaint over the alleged incident in October was, in turn, slapped with the fine by the   on May 14. 

 She approached HC on May 22, which stayed her punishment till September 7. “I filed a   in HC against the fine of Rs 6,000 levied on me by the university proctorial office for ‘physical assault and manhandling of a fellow student, besides using verbal abuses against associate dean of students of JNU’. This allegation is wrong and, in fact, the opposite of what transpired on October 10 last year when it was the associate dean who molested me,” the student said. 
 
 She said the incident took place during the “raids” conducted on the campus hostels by security guards. The students had then termed it as an invasion of their privacy. The complainant claimed that while the “raids” were going on, she found an outsider, who came out of the associate dean’s office, taking pictures of the girl students. The students raised slogans against the dean at Sabarmati Dhaba later in the evening. The matter escalated and “the associate dean pushed me”, the complainant said. She was served with a notice from the proctor’s office on October 17 for physically assaulting and abusing the associate dean.
 
 The high court, in its observation, said that the university could not enforce disciplinary action against the complainant till the case was decided.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the associate dean said: “I did not complain against the girl but it was the other students who did so. I was merely near the spot where the incident happened.”
 
 The university proctor office didn’t respond to queries.
