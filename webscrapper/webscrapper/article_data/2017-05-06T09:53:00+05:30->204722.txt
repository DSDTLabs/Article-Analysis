NEW DELHI:   led the Congress in celebrating the   in the   case as closure for the victim’s family. In a statement, the Congress chief said, “Four years after the heartbreaking Nirbhaya case that agonised the soul of India, justice has been delivered. I feel deeply for the courageous family of this brave daughter of India who became a   of every woman’s fight against sexual violence.”

 Sonia called the judgment a reminder that every citizen needed to contribute in building a safe society for women. “To lead a life of dignity, pride, respect and equality is the right of every daughter of India and it is for all of us to ensure that she gets it,” she added. Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal said, “The rule of law has brought the culprits to book. The SC order must have brought some relief, some peace, to the victim family.”
 
 The CPM, however, said the rule of law should apply equally to all. Drawing a parallel between the Nirbhaya and the Bilkis Bano cases, it said the difference in rulings by the SC and the Mumbai High Court exposed the judiciary’s “double standards”. 
 
 CPM politburo member Brinda Karat said, “The SC judgment upholding the death sentences of Nirbhaya’s rapists and murderers comes a day after the Mumbai HC refused a CBI plea to hang those who were found guilty in the Bilkis Bano gang rape and murder case. Now, will the SC, in the light of the Nirbhaya case, call for that file? Or will they, when they are appealed to, change the Mumbai HC’s verdict and hang them?” On Thursday, the Bombay HC refused to hand down death penalty to three of the 11 persons convicted of raping Bilkis Bano in the aftermath of the Gujarat riots in 2002. Instead, the court upheld life sentences for all 11 accused.
