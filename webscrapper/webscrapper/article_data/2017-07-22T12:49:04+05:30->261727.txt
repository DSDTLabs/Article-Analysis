HYDERABAD: The SIT sleuths continued to grill Tollywood actor   about drug consumption in the film industry for over 12 hours at the Abkari Bhavan on Friday. The actor reportedly revealed the names of nine actors belonging to prominent families. He turned up at 10.30 am. 

 Excise sleuths grilled him till late at night. The investigators compared his responses with those by Puri Jagannadh and Shyam Naidu. â€œAll three Tollywood personalities have given some common info," an SIT official said.
 
 
 
 
 Earlier, authorities wrote letters to 26 top schools of Hyderabad and 27 colleges, urging them to curb drug menace among students.
 
 The move comes after excise officials busted a three-member gang peddling drugs, including LSD, exposing the dark underbelly of the city where several school students were among their clientele, some as young as class 8 and 9 students.
 
 About 700 dots of LSD worth Rs 20 lakh and 35gm of MDMA worth Rs 1.4 lakh were recovered from the peddlers.
 
 Calvin Mascrenhas, 29, Mohammed Abdul Wahed, 20, and his elder brother Mohammed Abdul Quddus, 29, were arrested with contraband by the excise wing.
 
 WhatsApp messages on mobiles seized from peddlers give a peek into the murky world of school-going addicts. "I liked the drug. It gave me a nearly 12-hour high. I want more, can u arrange?" a class 9 girl student of a prominent Hyderabad school pleaded in her message to a drug peddler on his WhatsApp.
