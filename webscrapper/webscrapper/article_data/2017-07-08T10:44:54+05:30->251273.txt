NASHIK: The district administration on Friday announced monetary compensation to   in 49 villages whose lands the state government wants to directly purchase for the   Super Communication Expressway project, also known as the Samruddhi Mahamarg.

 Nashik is one of the 10 districts through which the expressway will pass. The total stretch of the expressway is a little over 700 km.
 
 District collector   said the minimum and maximum compensation would vary between Rs 40.99 lakh and Rs 84.71 lakh per hectare of rain-fed   in case the purchase is done directly from farmers. Those with semi-irrigated land would be entitled to one-and-half times more compensation while farmers with fully irrigated land would get twice the amount paid for rain-fed land. The compensation would be cleared within 48 hours of the farmers handing over their lands.
 
 About 85% of the land being taken for the expressway is fully irrigated.   said farmers unhappy with the compensation rate could raise objections with the administration but, after accepting the compensation, they would lose the right to challenge the rate in a court of law. 
 
 The compensation for compulsory acquisition of land is 25% lower.
