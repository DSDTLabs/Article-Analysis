 Actress   experienced something similar recently. The 'Sanngto Aika' actress was brought on board the movie 'Rubik's Cube' by director  . She was asked to dub for actress   as the latter was busy with exams and couldn't dub for her role. 
 Sharing her thoughts about the same, Sanskruti said, "Actually I am very scared of dubbing itself, because you have to act all over again for that. But voicing someone else was a lot more challenging. When you are dubbing for your character, you know how to speak and express, but syncing with someone elseâ€™s expression and adding more value to it is something really tough." 
 
  
  
 Calling it a learning experience, the actress added, "Surabhi was busy with her exams and that's why I got this chance of dubbing. I am glad that Mahesh Manjrekar trusted me with it. Frankly speaking, I tried to match her emotions rather than trying to speak like her. No special preparation was done from my side, but understanding the character made my job easy and we could get the most out of it."
  
  
 
 Sanskruti will also be seen in Manjrekar's next film titled '  - Friendship Unlimited' along with 'Sairat' actor  .
