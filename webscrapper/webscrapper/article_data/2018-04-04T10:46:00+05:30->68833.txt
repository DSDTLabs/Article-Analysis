LUCKNOW: The huge sum of money spent in cleaning the Gomti under the riverfront project is going waste as effluents from   drain continue to flow into river, adding to its pollution levels. And this is happening due to faulty design of intercepting drains by the irrigation department.

 The sewage from Kukrail drain falls into the Gomti near the Gomti barrage.
 
 Two large intercepting (trunk) drains were built along the Gomti banks from the   bridge to the downstream of Gomti Barrage to carry sewage outflow from over 20 drains of the city, including Kukrail drain, and discharge them in the downstream area near La Martiniere College. From there, the sewage would flow towards Bharwara sewage treatment plant.
 
 However, due to faulty plan, the intercepting drains are not large enough to carry the entire outflow of Kukrail drain. As a result, excess discharge from Kukrail drain is flowing into the river instead of flowing into the intercepting drain.
 
 Locals say the sewage has been flowing into the Gomti for the past many years. “Many fish have perished in this stretch due to extreme pollution,” said a local resident. Kukrail drain receives discharge from 14 smaller drains and hence its flow towards the river is always higher.
 
 The irrigation department admits fault in designing of the intercepting drains. An official said, “The intercepting drain’s maximum width is 1600mm, which is designed to carry sewage outflow of city’s drains during lean period (other than rainy season). Whenever discharge increases, especially during monsoon, the excess sludge falls into the river. Since Kukrail drain is the second largest drain in the city, it always has excess outflow.”
 
 A probe is underway into the faulty design of the two intercepting drains.
