Coimbatore: Seeking the intervention of the district collector to speed up the procedure to arrest the accused, who allegedly tied him to an iron pillar and trashed him, a 42-year-old resident of the Nilgiris filed a petition on Monday. It was almost a month since the first information report was registered under the prevention of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes atrocities act, but the accused was not arrested till date, petitioner D Manoharan, who registered a complaint with Karamadai police, said. Two years ago, when he was doing vegetable business, he had borrowed Rs 10,000 from one of his neighbours and had returned about Rs 7,000 by paying Rs 500 per week for almost one-and-a-half years, Manoharan said. “To claim the rest of the amount, the neighbour took my motorcycle and its registration certification,” he said. He did not hear from the neighbour for some time after giving him the two-wheeler, Manoharan said. “On April 15, when I was at Mettupalayam market, I met him again. He started to accuse and abuse me for not paying the full loan amount. I was taken to his shop at Karamadai where he not only accused me verbally, but also assaulted me. I was tied to an iron pillar and was beaten till I turned blue,” he said. He was admitted in the government hospital at Mettupalayam and was then shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for further treatment, Manoharan said.  Police had filed a case under the Section 294 (b) (reciting obscene words), 323 (volunterily causing hurt) 506 (i) (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and SC/ST prevention of atrocities act. Receiving his petition, district collector TN Hariharan assured to take necessary action.
