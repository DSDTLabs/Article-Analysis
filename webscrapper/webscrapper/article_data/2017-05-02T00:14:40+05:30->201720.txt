BHIWANDI: A 60-year-old   worker was   on Monday for allegedly   aged 8-9 at knife-point for the last six months here. Aslam Momin, a helper, was arrested after families of four girls complained about him. Another family came forward later. 

 Police said Momin was married and had children. They said that after watching porn videos, he would target girls playing near the powerloom. He would molest them at knife-point. The incident came to light recently when one victim started avoiding going out to play with other girls. When her parent enquired, she disclosed the incident. Later, families of four girls approached the powerloom owner, and demanded he sack Momin but he refused. They then lodged a police complaint.
 
 Dinesh Katke, senior inspector,   city police station, said they were probing past complaints too. Good K Sayyed, sub-inspector probing the case, said, “A primary probe shows that the area was isolated and the accused, after watching porn videos, would molest the victims at knife-point and threaten to kill their parents if they objected.” The victims said that in the last six months, the accused molested them several times.
