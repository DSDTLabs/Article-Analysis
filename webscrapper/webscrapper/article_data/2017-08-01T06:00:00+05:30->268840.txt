Kuchipudi exponent  , his students and guru KV  , recently enthralled Hyderabadis at Phoenix Arena with an outstanding performance titled ‘Kuchipudi Dance and Dialogue’. Commemorating dance maestro Dr Vempati Chinna Satyam’s fifth death anniversary, Khan, who is a second generation student of the exponent, paid a fitting tribute to the legend along with his students and guru Subramanyam.

 The evening commenced with Ganesh Kowtham, a solo act in praise of Lord Ganesha, by 11-year-old Abhinay Sai Avula from USA. The second piece Brahmanjali, which is considered to be a favourite piece of Dr Satyam, comprised of many Sanskrit slokas and was performed by Jahnavi, Sarayu, Pravallika and Sai Sruthi. The performance with its mood and near-perfect execution turned out to be a graceful tribute to the maestro. 
 This was followed by an interactive session between Khan and Subramanyam. Both the guru and shishia touched upon the intricacies of each performance throwing light on their significance. 
 
 
 
 “Usually, all dance performances start on the stage and end in the green room; it is devoid of any interaction between the dancers and the audience. So, I thought of a different concept, which gives my students and the audience a practical knowledge about each performance,” says, Khan. 
 Up next was Jathiswaram, a purely footwork-based piece by Khan's students and the recital concluded with Jo Achutananda, a performance by Subramanyam.
