BENGALURU: The Karnataka Pradesh   Committee (KPCC) on Wednesday filed a complaint with the Lokayukta against senior   leaders   and H N   for allegedly providing money to the high command when the party was in power from 2008 to 2013.

 The complaint filed by C M Dhananjaya, chairman of KPCC's legal cell, refers to the CD which allegedly caught Yeddyurappa and Ananth Kumar in a conversation about the payment made to the BJP high command.
 
 Quoting the alleged conversation, the complaint reads: “You have given to the high command ... I have also given ... But I have not given Rs 1,000 crore... As you'd given it then, he has also given, it seems.“
 
 The complaint sought the Lokay ukta's intervention in investigating the matter further.
 
 
 
 On February 13, the Congress released an edited video to counter Yeddyurappa's allegations that chief minister   sent Rs 1,000 crore to the Congress top brass in Delhi. The kickbacks were allegedly received from various projects in the state, including the controversial steel flyover proposed in Bengaluru.
 
 In the video, minister Ananth Kumar is heard telling Yeddyurappa to keep the bribery charges alive until next year's assembly elections.
 
 Recorded at a BJP function, the video has Kumar and Yeddyurappa, oblivious to a microphone in front of them, allegedly joking about the political fallout of the bribery charges against the chief minister.
