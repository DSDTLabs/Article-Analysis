NEW DELHI: Buyers descended in hordes on showrooms across the country hoping to grab a scooter or motorcycle being sold at a huge discount after the   banned polluting BS-III vehicles. Sales of two-wheelers shot through the roof, showrooms ran out of stock and in some places police had to be called in to tame angry customers.

 Companies such as Hero Moto, Honda Motorcycles and Scooter India (HMSI), TVS and Bajaj Auto threw in last-minute   to clear inventory after the Supreme Court’s ruling this week. “It’s like Diwali and Dhanteras rush. We are flooded with customers,” a leading dealer in Delhi told TOI.
 
 “It’s a mad rush. Most of the inventory is sold out, but we are still getting walk-ins and calls from customers who are looking to cash in on the unprecedented discounts,” a top dealer of Hero Moto in the Maharashtra region told TOI.
 
 It was a similar scene across counters of other companies as well, with many dealers running out of stock as the attractive scheme ran for two days. “With a proactive preparedness towards the launch of BSIV-compliant vehicles, Hero Moto liquidated large BS-III inventory, leading upto March 29th. By the end of today, we would have sold almost all of our BS-III inventory,” Hero Moto Chairman Pawan Munjal said.
 
 Companies have offered discounts running between Rs 3,000 and Rs 20,000 across their model range to clear the pending stocks.
 
 A huge crowd gathered at a showroom in Badaun in UP and people tried to break through the main entrance and police had to be deployed to tame the mob.
 
 In Jaipur, buyers gathered outside showrooms hours before they opened hoping to grab a discounted bike. But many were disappointed when they told that stocks had run out. The number of two-wheelers registered in Bengaluru went up by 100% and on Friday, it soared by 246% as customers thronged showrooms. In Nagpur, too police had to be called in at several showroom to control the crowd.
