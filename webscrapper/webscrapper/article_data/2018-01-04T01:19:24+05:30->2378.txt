MUMBAI: Angel investor Mahesh   has been booked for stalking and sexual harassment on a complaint filed by a Delhi woman.

 In April 2017, the woman had complained to the   accusing Murthy of making objectionable, derogatory and sexual remarks and obscene signs. The   had received other complaints too and sent them to the Maharashtra DGP in November. The case was registered in the city as Murthy resided in Bandra. Khar police filed an FIR on December 29 after the initial probe.
 
 Murthy did not respond to messages, calls and emails sent by this correspondent. Senior inspector Ramchandra Jadhav told TOI that the FIR against Murthy also included offences under section 67 of the IT Act that deals with punishment relating to publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form. A NCW statement said after the Delhi woman sent in her complaint in 2017, the panel took cognisance of the matter as it had received a similar complaint against Murthy in early 2017 too. Besides, it said, there were several media reports about other women.
 
 Though Murthy posted an apology for some of his posts after the NCW took cognisance of the matter, the panel sought the DGPâ€™s intervention and action as per law. It said such acts not only amounted to outraging the modesty of women but would also attract action under cyber laws.
