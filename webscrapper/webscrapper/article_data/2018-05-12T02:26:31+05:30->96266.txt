 Since he had failed in Jurisprudence (0 marks) and got 36 marks in Contract–II, Mahendar applied for revaluation but was told it was too late.

 Mahendar’s advocates, Datta and Sonali Pawar, said he stood to lose an academic year for no fault of his. University advocate Rui Rodrigues submitted that on verification Mahendar had passed his Jurisprudence paper. He said as far as the Contract-II paper, if the court directed the varsity, it would permit him to apply for revaluation.
 
 The bench said there would be no impediment to the college conducting internal exams and directed that his hall ticket is issued well before the May 22exams.
