  : In a significant move to empower women, the new government in   has decided to ensure 10% reservation for women in the top rung of the police force. 

 Sources said the state government, to begin with, would make reservation for women in  's Grade-II jobs - both for promotion and fresh recruitment. The decision is likely to get the approval of the state cabinet this week. 
 
 According to reports, the HC had directed the then Left Front government to ensure at least 5% reservation for women in top posts of the police department. Earlier in 2009, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) had directed all the states to make an attempt to reserve 33% posts for women. Recently, the CM came across the HC directive and the   advisory and decided to implement it, an official said.
