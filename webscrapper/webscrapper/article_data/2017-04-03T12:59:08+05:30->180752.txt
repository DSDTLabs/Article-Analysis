NAINITAL: In an unprecedented move to tackle receding water levels in the region, Nainital district administration has banned all commercial and private construction in the district. The ban will remain in force until June 30 when monsoon arrives in the state, said district magistrate Deepak Rawat.
 
  Rawat said that only government construction projects “which are of very critical nature” would be permitted for the time being. The administration has also decided that no new water connections will be provided till June 30.
  
  The move came after various areas in Haldwani and   reported severe water shortage. The DM said, “Lots of water is being used in construction sites. Water in lakes and rivers of the district has receded to alarming rates. The ban will manage the situation till monsoon arrives.”
  
  The announcement has left various stakeholders in the construction industry as well as residents whose houses are under construction worried. A businessman on condition of anonymity said, “The industry was already suffering losses due to ban on mining. Complete ban will impact our livelihood.”
  
  Meanwhile, in another measure to address water woes of the district,   sansthan will implement a rotation policy for water supply. Under the policy, water would be supplied to particular areas for fixed hours. Various localities of Haldwani, Nainital, Kaladhungi, Ramnagar and Lalkuan will receive water for two to four hours depending on various factors.
  
  Many areas currently receive contaminated water, irregular water supply and sometimes no water at all. In Haldwani, Ramnagar and Lalkuan, people have to depend on private tanker suppliers who charge Rs 1,000-1,200 for a single tanker with a capacity of 20,000 litres.
  
  Jal sansthan and jal nigam are building overhead water storage tanks and tubewells while   (ADB) has proposed to lay new pipe lines for improved water supply in the district.
