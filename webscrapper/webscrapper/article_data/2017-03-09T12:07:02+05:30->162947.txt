PUNE: Civilians and armed forces personnel in any part of the country will now get medical advice on their   over phone. 

 Thanks to city-based  's ( ) new   (IVRS), wherein a team of doctors, including senior army officers, is available on phones to give timely medical advice to patients.
 
 Although ALC was established with the primary objective of meeting the prosthetic and orthotic requirements of disabled personnel of the armed forces, from 1951 the facilities were gradually extended to civilians as well.
 
 Deputy commandant Col SK Singh of ALC told TOI, "Earlier, patients would travel all the way to the centre to get medical advice on their limb injuries. So we started the IVRS system where experts have been roped in to attend patients' calls and give them medical advice. Based on the seriousness of the case, we call the patient to the centre. This has helped save time and money." 
 
 Once the patient comes to the centre, the experts' team measure the limb. "As soon as the limb gets manufactured, we inform the patient and replace it at the centre. This has reduced pendency completely and has delivered timely service to patients," Singh added. Materials used to manufacture limbs are mostly indigenous. Components are manufactured either locally or at the   in 512 Army base workshop.
 
 According to ALC records, the centre gets around 20 calls on a daily basis. Apart from the armed forces personnel, 70 civilian patients come to the centre's out patient department monthly on an average. In 2016, 738 patients were admitted to the ALC, which included serving armed forces personnel, veterans and civilians. As per the 2016 statistics of ALC, 900 civilian patients reported at the out patient department, of which 50 got hospitalised. 
 
 ALC has also started sending basic requirements like replacement of limbs' shoes, socks, etc to the patients on their postal address to save their time and money.
