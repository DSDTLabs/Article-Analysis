NEW DELHI: In the face of several people asking him this question,   MP   wants to let everyone know once and for all that he's not joining the  .
 
  It's unclear where this conjecture emerged from, but perhaps it was because last month he wrote an essay about the merits of a Presidential system of government versus a Parliamentary system.
  
  "In view of the number of people asking, let me repeat that my convictions are a matter of record and they do not match those of (the) Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)," Tharoor said yesterday in a post on Facebook.
  
  The Thiruvananthapuram MP described unequivocally why 
  .
  
  "For 40+years I have spoken and written in defence of a pluralist India with equal rights for all its citizens and communities. On this, no compromise," Tharoor explained.
  
  What he means, by implication, is that the BJP's idea of India is not of a pluralist country and not of one where all have equal rights.
  
 
 
 
 Earlier this month in an interview with TOI, Tharoor did say he doesn't disagree with the BJP on absolutely everything.
  
  "I have not disagreed with BJP on some issues like Swachh Bharat, but on the nature of India, its pluralistic and tolerant character, one has to be uncompromising," he told TOI.
  
  Tharoor said he was open about his belief in Hinduism even when he was a top   (UN) official, but yet he had attacked the demolition of the Babri mosque in a speech at the world body.
  
  "This is not the Hindu religion I was taught. Hinduism believes in tolerance. Hinduism is openly welcoming... So, I have a Nehruvian view and on the basis of this belief, I have fought for a plural India," he told TOI.
  
  About a decade ago, 
  was in the running to be UN Secretary General. He withdrew his nomination after a permanent member - said to be the US - vetoed his nomination.
