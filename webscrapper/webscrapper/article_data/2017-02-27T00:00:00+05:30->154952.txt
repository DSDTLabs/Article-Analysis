We had recently reported that   would be seen as a college professor in director Ajai Vasudev’s movie, scripted by Pulimurugan fame Udayakrishna.

  The director now spills some more details about the plot, Mammootty’s character and the cast of the yet-to-be-titled film. “Unni Mukundan plays an important role in the movie but not as a student. I want to keep his role under wraps for now.” When we contacted the actor, he confirmed that he has given the nod for the movie but is yet to sign the dotted line. Incidentally, Mammootty and Unni will also reportedly team up for scriptwriter Sethu’s directorial debut. Ajai’s movie will mark the third time Unni and Mammootty would be working together.
 
  The movie, Ajai says, will be a “mass thriller set against the backdrop of a government arts college, a full-on entertainer.”
 
 Speaking further on Mammootty’s role, the director, who had previously teamed up with the megastar in Rajadhi Raja, says, “He plays a strict college professor who doesn’t mollycoddle his students, a rough and tough character with a short temper. The characterisation is very much on the lines of the larger-than-life, mass roles that he has done previously.”
 
 Apart from Unni, the movie also has Mukesh and Salim Kumar in pivotal roles. “Mukesh plays the vice principal of the college,” says the director, adding that the film will go on floors by April first week with Kollam being considered as the main location. Meanwhile, the film’s scriptwriter Udayakrishna has been roped in for Mammootty’s next project with Vysakh, Raja 2.
