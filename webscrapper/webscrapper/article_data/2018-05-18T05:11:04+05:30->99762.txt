NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday rejected the bail plea of  , arrested in connection with alleged irregularities in allotment of   ( ) contracts, observing that the release of money from the  , by submitting bills of a non-existent firm, was “grave” in nature.

 
 “PWD officials who are involved in the present case are still being interrogated. Investigation is at a very crucial juncture, releasing the accused on bail at this stage may affect the smooth flow of investigation,” observed special judge Sanjay Khanagwal.
 
 The FIR alleged that Vinay and his late father, who was chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s brother-in-law, were working on a project of over Rs 4 crore. After receiving a payment of Rs 3 crore, they showed fake bills of Rs 1 crore for procurement of steel from a company that was “non-existent”.
 
 Bansal’s lawyers B S Joon and Mohd Irshad argued that the allegation of Kejriwal influencing the PWD officials to award tenders to him was false and frivolous as the tender bid opened on January 19, 2015 when President’s rule was imposed in Delhi.
 
 The prosecution said the contractor did not submit the complete invoice of the material used to the department. It submitted that despite the same, the entire contract amount was released by PWD in connivance with the accused.
 
 The defense counsels, on the other hand, said as far the allegation of non-completion of work went, it was completed on November 23, 2015.
