CHENNAI: A day after a TOI report exposed operation of illegal   shops around Almathi, located in the northern suburbs of the city on Red Hills-Tiruvallur High Road, the Tasmac administration on Wednesday conducted a raid on the unauthorised shops. 

 Two such illegal outlets were closed and a total of 202   bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and beer were seized from the premises.
 
 The raid was conduced by a five member team led by Tasmac’s   district manager A G Rajarajan. According to official sources, the two illegal wine shops were functioning when the team visited these outlets at 12:30pm. “Tasmac wine shops were operating out of these buildings till the Supreme Court had banned sale of liquor within 500 metres of highways last year. The abandoned structures have been revived for the illegal activity,” a Tasmac official said. Two salesmen at the unauthorised shops in Gandhi Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar were caught red-handed. 
 
 “We have filed two FIRs against them for illegal liquor sale with the   (PEW) of the police department at Ponneri,” the official added.
 
 This apart, the ‘Nil, Kavani, Sel’ (stop, look and proceed) sign boards that were erected on the highway, indicating tipplers about the presence of the illegal shops in a few yards, were also removed by the authorities.
 
 However, in the report dated Wednesday, Sholavaram police inspector  , under whose jurisdiction these shops were operating, denied the existence of the illegal liquor outlets. “There are no such shops in these areas and no raids were conducted against such shops,” he replied, when asked about the raids by the Tasmac administration.
