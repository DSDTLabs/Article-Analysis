Sangolda: The ordinary gram sabha of   village panchayat held on Sunday witnessed heated discussions over the issue of open nullahs with villagers requesting the panchayat to cover them as they were causing a number of accidents. Other issues discussed were haphazard parking, illegal dumping of debris in the fields and operation of illegal kiosks.

 Local resident Sandra Fernandes pointed out to sarpanch Premanand Kochrekar about an accident which occurred due to an open nullah, to which he immediately agreed to cover all open drains in the village. Another resident, Anthony D’Souza, made a request to the sarpanch that Sangolda should be declared as a biodiversity heritage site like the villages of Curtorim, Rivona and Chicalim. D’Souza received support from other villagers on this matter. 
 
 Villagers also said that there was no action initiated against illegal kiosks.
