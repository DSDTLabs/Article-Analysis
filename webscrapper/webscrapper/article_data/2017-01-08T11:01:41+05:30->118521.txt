KOLKATA: The dissolution of the Board for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction ( ) has come as a huge blow to more than 3 lakh   employed in various sick units across the state. With none having a clue about the new law, they are doubtful of receiving their long-pending dues.

 Currently, there are 414 cases pending in BIFR and the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR) in Bengal. Among them, 318 are privately owned and 25 are central public sector undertakings. Revival schemes for 69 cases in the private sector have been approved and 150 are on-cause list of the BIFR. “Delhi office is monitoring 265 cases. At present, 117 live cases are being pursued,” a state government official said. 
 
 Anutosh Banerjee, former general secretary of the Federation of Burn Standard Officers Association, was anxious about workers’ dues. “BIFR used to deal with the dues but we don’t know what will happen under the new law. In Burn Standard, more than Rs 350 crore is due in form of wages. The new law, as far as we know, expedites the process and if not possible, it will go for liquidation. But then what will happen to hapless workers?” he wondered. The issue was also raised by state INTTUC president Pradip Banerjee.
 
 Over the years, BIFR has been both a lifeline and a curse for industrial units. The board has been successful in reviving a number of industrial bodies from the brink of a shutdown. Andrew Yule, for example, is a classic case of resurgence. “The company used the provisions of BIFR in true spirits and is now on the growth path,” said Andrew Yule former chairman Kallol Dutta. Kanoria Jute, too, used BIFR guidelines successfully for revival. 
 
  was on the verge of BIFR referral but it is making over Rs 100 crore profit every month. “Its networth had almost eroded but now the company is making huge profits,” an official of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation said.
