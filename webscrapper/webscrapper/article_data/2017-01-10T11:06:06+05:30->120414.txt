THRISSUR/ALAPUZZHA: Criticising chief minister  's response to the mass leave strike by the IAS officers in the state in protest against vigilance actions, Opposition Leader   said here on Monday that Vijayan had been acting like a dictator. 

  He was in Thrissur to inaugurate the DCC leaders' conference at the DCC office. 
 
 "The UDF is not supporting any group in the vigilance-civil servants issue. It is evident that the administration system in the state had been hit by the internal issues," he said adding that vigilance turned to be a toy that plays according to the ruling government's will.
 
  "It's because of the court's intervention that the vigilance registered a case against E P Jayarajan as first accused in the nepotism allegations, that too after 62 days of raising the allegations," he added and sought investigation against the chief minister too as no appointment happens without his knowledge.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP state general secretary M T Ramesh said that the chief minister has lost control over the state ministry and government. 
 
 He was speaking at the reception function accorded to the regional jatha organized by the BJP at Alappuzha on Monday.
 
 Ramesh said that within six months, Vijayan proved that he was the most inefficient chief minister in the history of the state. 
 
 The state administration under LDF is a repeat of the former UDF government, he said .
