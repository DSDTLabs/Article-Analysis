MLA from Chandausi seat Gulab Devi and MLA from Kannauj's Chhibramau seat Archana Pande were also sworn in as minister of state. 
 
 But the representation is far less than the quota of 33%. Experts said the problem is rooted in distribution of tickets which is visible in figures.

Women leaders are not preferred as candidates, therefore, their representation in the house is a meagre 8-10%," remarked Sanjay Rai, core committee member, Association for Democratic Reforms, UP. 
 
 Faculty,  , Prof Nishi Pandey blamed lack of political will for it. "Political parties may blame each other for not letting 33% reservation become a reality. BJP, which supports the idea of 33% reservation, giving ministerial berth to only five speaks of their double standard," she remarked. 
 
 Of the total candidates fielded by the party, around 8% were women. Ruling SP and BJP were most generous while giving tickets. Congress, the party that mooted the idea of 33% reservation gave only 4% of its tickets to women while BJP that fielded only 3% women candidates. In all, 445 women were in the fray of whom 40 won.
 
 Among the winners, maximum 34 are from BJP, two each from BSP and Congress and one each from SP and Apna Dal (Sonelal). In 2012, 19 women candidates had won on SP ticket, six are from BJP, three each from BSP and Congress, one from Apna Dal and one is independent.
