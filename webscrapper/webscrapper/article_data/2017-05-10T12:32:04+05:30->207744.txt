PANAJI: Operations came to a standstill at the offices of the Kadamba transport corporation (KTC) and the regional transport officer (RTO) at  , on Tuesday, after network cables snapped due to ongoing road works at Altinho. With internet and intranet connectivity failing, daily commuters, citizens registering vehicles and students answering licence tests were among the many who suffered.

 Michael Dalgado, who avails of the KTC bus pass system was among many others who couldn’t swipe his RFID card for his daily commute. “What is the whole point of a pass system if internet connectivity is going to be a problem?” KTC’s monthly pass counter remained closed through the second half of the day after the cables snapped. Things at the interstate bus counter weren’t any better. “We have had to send back nearly 20 potential customers who came to book interstate bus tickets. Lack of internet also barred us from handling online bookings which resulted in a loss of approximately Rs 50,000,” said bookings clerk, Moru Sawant.
 
 Learner’s licence tests that are conducted online at the Panaji RTO were also affected and candidates were sent back. RTO officials said that cash transactions are also affected. Money for payment of taxes, vehicle registration fees etc have not been collected. “Everything is cashless at the RTO. The internet shutdown brought everything to a halt,” an official said. “The issue will be rectified by the end of the day,” said   engineer, Preetam Shet.
