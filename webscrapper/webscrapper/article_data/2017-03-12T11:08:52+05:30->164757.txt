VISAKHAPATNAM: Penalties for cyber related offences should be made more stringent, said chief justice of   G Rohini while addressing around 600 advocates at a seminar on   hosted by the Federation of Women Lawyers (FWL) of   here on Saturday.

 “With massive online activities and data exchange on the internet, cyber crime and crime against women have become quite frequent and therefore lawyers should upgrade and equip themselves with the changing laws. Awareness is also required among the litigant public,” Justice Rohini added.
 
 Justice Rohini also spoke on gender disparity and gender stereotyping in the legal profession even though the legal service has witnessed a significant entry of women in recent years and women occupying around 50 per cent seats in law schools across the country. “Despite such a large number of women law graduates, very few women practice and even fewer survive in the profession due to less opportunities for growth and advancement, overwork, income issues and so on. Women are still burdened with family responsibilities and need to balance between home, child care and profession. Even if they are practising, their areas of practice remain mostly restricted to family disputes and cases related to atrocities against women rather than corporate and criminal law. Clients are still hesitant to engage women lawyers and doubt their legal acumen. Therefore, there’s a need to take up women’s issues and do away with gender disparity in the judiciary.”
 
 D Aruna Kumari, lady representative of the  , pointed out that women empowerment is inversely proportional to cyber crime. “Though crime rates have gone up with the new technology and it’s a threat to the security of a person, many such aspects are not covered under the Information Technology Act 2000. One can get bail despite committing a cyber offence. Therefore, the punishment under the IT Act needs to be more stringent,” she added.
