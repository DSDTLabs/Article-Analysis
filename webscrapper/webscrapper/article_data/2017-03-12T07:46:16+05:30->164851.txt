KOZHIKODE: It is easy for the police to fabricate a terror case in the country than to foist a case against a thief because all they need, to make a person terrorist, is just a Muslim name, said  , who was acquitted by the special court in Delhi in December, 2016. Malik, who was an informer for the   (IB), was arrested and imprisoned after he disregarded certain directives from IB. 

 Addressing the People's Tribunal on Saturday - organized by the   - he said the special cell of the Delhi police was on his tail after the arrest of his brother in 1991. "Later, I was in IB's custody and officers wanted me to work for the agency," he said, adding that IB offered him Rs 7,000/month as salary.
 
 "They convinced me that I was working for the country. Later, they wanted me to go to Pakistan on a secret mission. They also asked me to work in Muslim-dominated areas and instigate youths to participate in jihad," Irshad said. When he refused to follow orders, Irshad was arrested. He fought a legal battle for 11 years to prove his innocence. 
 
 Rashid Hussain, who was an accused in the Jaipur blast in 2008, said IB had a role in every blast that occurred in the country. "I was involved in helping blast victims and had interacted with 250 of them in a month after the blast. I was detained illegally for several days. The only evidence against me was the email I sent to Yahya Kammukutty, who was later let off by the court in the Hubballi terror conspiracy," he said.
 
 Yahya Kammukutty, Syed Imran (who was acquitted in the Mecca masjid blast case), Nisar (who was let of in the Panayikulam SIMI case), Shahul Hameed (Thiruvananthapuram resident who was accused of propagating communal content through Facebook), Hanif Pakitwala (who was let of in the tiffin box bomb case in Ahmedabad) and Abrar Ahmed (who was forced to become an approver in the Mecca Masjid blast case) narrated their experiences.
