Vadodara: A five-member probe committee appointed by the Maharaja Sayajirao University to probe allegations of ragging levelled by two third-year students of Faculty of Law against three fifth year students last month submitted its report on Wednesday. 

 In the report, the committee has clearly stated that the allegations are baseless and the incidents which occurred on April 17 cannot be defined as ragging.
 
 The university had constituted the committee under convenorship of professor R C Patel after students made contradictory claims on the incidents of April 17 at Faculty of Law when two student groups supported by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI) had come face to face at the faculty premises.
 
 MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas confirmed that he has received the report from the committee which has also checked the CCTV footage to ascertain the facts. 
 
 “On the basis of the statements recorded and witnesses examined, the committee finds this to be a case of political rivalry between two groups which led to a clash between the two and distinguished from ragging. 
 
 After examining all the statements and the CCTV footage, the committee does not identify the alleged incident as ragging,” reads the report submitted by the committee. 
 
 The committee had checked CCTV footage of seven premises including parking area, entrance of the faculty building, area outside classrooms, classrooms, passage towards drinking water among others. 
 
 The committee has also stated that the statements of complainants contradict to the actual CCTV footage. “The version of complainants recorded before the committee states that they were late in entering the examination hall by 30 to 40 minutes as they were obstructed outside the premises by the accused. This version is contradicting the CCTV footage,” the report states.
