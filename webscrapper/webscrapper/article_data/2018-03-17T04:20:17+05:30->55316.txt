 "This performance took me back to my childhood days," he said.
 
 "I used to dance on girls' songs and my friends used to make fun of me. Upset about this, I went to an elocution teacher at the age of 13 and she said, â€˜Why do you want to change the way talk, you're just fine'. That's when I gathered courage to face the world.
 
 "Today if I was still talking like that I wouldn't change it. Even if one of my kids talk or walk like that, I wouldn't change them," added Karan.
