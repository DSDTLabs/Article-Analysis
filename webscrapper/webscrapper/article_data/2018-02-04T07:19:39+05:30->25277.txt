HYDERABAD: The National Town and Country Planners   has recommended that climate change policies be prepared at the city level, adding that while preparing policies, local planning agencies, state and central government should be incorporated into the master plan. Since cities consume more than 70 per cent of all energy used, and produce 80 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions, there is a necessity for climate change policy, the town planners congress said. 

  and Country Planners' Congress, themed 'Urban Environmental Planning: Consequences and Challenges', organized by Institute of Town Planners' India ( ), concluded on Saturday. 
 
 ITPI recommended that all efforts be made to protect existing water bodies in cities, even if large amounts of government investment are required. Attempts should also be made to recover water bodies lost to urban development, by vacating these spaces through the mechanism of Transferable Development Rights (TDR).
 
 "Climate change also challenges economic growth of the country because highly trained labour will be less willing to live, in a highly polluted city. To bring about sustainable economic growth, climate change abatement policies must be implemented urgently," the Congress said.
 
 Also on the table was the centre's proposed Green Mobility Scheme. which would significantly reduce cities' contribution to greenhouse gases. The scheme mandates use of green fuels for public vehicles, and encourages public modes of transportation like metro and buses. 
 
 Panchayat Raj minister Jupally Krishna Rao and Director of Municipal Administration TK Sridevi spoke at the valedictory function.
