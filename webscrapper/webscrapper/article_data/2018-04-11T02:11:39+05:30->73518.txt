THANE: The   (TMC) has decided to upload all the information sought under the Right To Information ( ) Act on its official website.

 The move to upload all the RTIs is a decision by civic chief  , as a section of RTI activists from the city were found to be allegedly misusing the Act for personal gains and even blackmailing.

 A civic official said, “This move of uploading the information on the website will prevent misuse of the RTI Act and the same will remain open to public. The information will have the name of applicants and the query sought,” said a civic official.
 
 Vishal Kharpude, a resident of  , said, “It is a good move as anyone can access the information sought under RTI by anyone.”
 
 Another resident added that RTI activists often brought out illegalities, which are concealed after money comes into the picture. “Such illegalities will also be in public domain,” said the resident.
