 ﻿Kamal Haasan has always taken the path less travelled. The actor is cur rently gearing up for his debut on small screen with Bigg Boss. Talking about the future of entertainment, Ulaganayagan says, “You watch images on wrist watches, within your spectacle. You are going to watch a big spectacle through the spectacle that you are wearing. You just have to flip on the screen, and the whole world will be your canvas. I wrote this 30 years ago: entertainment will be picked out of your own brain, your choice. Insert the chip into you and you can enjoy the best story . They have a series of stories that you enjoy and you become the protagonist. The film industry is silly; the industry body is fighting their fear. It is a knee-jerk reaction.Including exhibitors, distributors, and actors, everybody is scared of that change.They talk well and know that change is the only constant. But they only keep it at a philosophical level.“ The actor will begin shooting for the show soon and the house for the show is under construction.
