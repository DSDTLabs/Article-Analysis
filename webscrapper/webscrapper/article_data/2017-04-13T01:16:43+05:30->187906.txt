NEW DELHI: AAP convenor   has written to   demanding that all electronic voting machines (EVM) from Rajasthan brought for the municipal polls should be immediately withdrawn alleging that they have been tampered with.

 The chief minister has also demanded that the civic polls should only be held with EVMs that have VVPAT machines. Kejriwal also wants all state and nationally recognised parties to be allowed technical examination of machines that are being used for the polls.
 
 In a letter to Delhi state election commissioner SK Srivastava, Kejriwal has said, “I am shocked to learn that you have procured obsolete and discarded generation-1 machines from Rajasthan to conduct municipal elections. I am told that you wrote a letter to CEC in December 2016 asking for generation-1 EVMs to conduct civic polls. Why did you ask for them as they are incompatible with VVPAT?”
 
 “Generation 1 EVMs are the most insecure with least security features. SC has categorically said that all elections should be held with VVPAT machines. Why didn’t you at least make an attempt to procure VVPAT machines?” Kejriwal said in the letter.
 
 Kejriwal further stated, “There are around 11,000 booths in Delhi and EC keeps 10% machines as standby. Almost 15,000 EVMs are available in Delhi, so you have sufficient machines here. We demand that all machines sourced from Rajasthan be immediately withdrawn.”
 
 The CM said that SEC had allowed allow technical examination of the EVMs last week. “Now you are refusing to allow us technical examination saying that you have sought permission from CEC. We met CEC last week. We were told that SEC was a completely independent body and did not need CEC’s permission for anything. Then why are you seeking permission?” Kejriwal said.
