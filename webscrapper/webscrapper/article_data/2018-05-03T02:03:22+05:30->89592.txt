NEW DELHI: Reflecting the resistance of builders even to stern directions from the courts, the Supreme Court on Wednesday was constrained to warn   of “dire consequences” while giving the developer a final opportunity to instal basic amenities like lifts in multi-storey buildings. 

 The apex court’s directions came in the context of its efforts to ensure safety and security of people living in societies built by the developer even as a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit also said the court would not “spare” anyone in protecting the interests of around 42,000 home-buyers who are not getting possession of their flats as the builder had not been able to complete them. 
 
 Some of the company’s projects in Noida and Greater Noida have been completed and possession of flats handed over to the buyers but elevators are yet to be installed. According to flat owners, fire safety and electrical works had also not been completed, making the flats uninhabitable.
 
 Despite the direction to promoters to put in place basic facilities in buildings, the company failed to comply. Taking exception to the company’s failure to implement its order, the bench granted the promoters a last opportunity to install lifts in the buildings and set a deadline of May 7 to complete the task.
 
 “If elevators are not installed then you will be in trouble. Let it be made functional by Monday. Non-compliance of our order could attract serious consequences. We have been very lenient to you so far but we will not spare anybody,” the bench told advocate Gaurav Bhatia, the counsel of the promoters.
 
 There are many projects which have not taken off as yet and nine projects are at completion stage.
 
 As the company is facing isolvency proceedings, the apex court took upon itself the task to get the projects completed under its supervision and exploring ways on how the company could raise money to complete unfinished projects.
