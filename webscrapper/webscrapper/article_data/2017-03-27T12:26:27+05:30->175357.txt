Panaji: The proposal in   to regularize illegal houses, especially on comunidade land has been opposed by  , alleging that it is politically motivated to woo a section of the electorate.

 Reacting to the budget proposal, Andre   of the association of components of comunidades (AoCC) said that successive governments are taking people for a ride on the issue. The promise of legalizing unauthorized houses on comunidade lands has now been an issue for over a decade.
 
 “There is no known law in force in Goa that provides scope for any authority to confer any kind of title or right on any person or persons under the Portuguese Civil Code and or as foreseen by the Transfer of Property Act in force, as to own and or hold land in private capacity, when the said land is situated within the limits of absolute private villages belonging to the gaunkars or to their village communities,” Pereira said.
 
 AoCC is trying to protect the interests of 220-odd comunidade bodies in Goa, but various factors including acquisition of its land for public utility projects, encroachments and corruption within the bodies has led to the near-collapse of the age-old system.
 
 Chief minister,   had said that regularization of illegal houses, especially on comunidade and government-owned land being a long-pending issue, the government would consider enacting an appropriate and effective legislation to grant relief to these occupants.
 
 Further, comunidade leaders point out that the governor of the state is under solemn assurance to provide administrative tutelage from time to time to protect comunidades and remove encroachments and legislate in pursuance of this objective.
