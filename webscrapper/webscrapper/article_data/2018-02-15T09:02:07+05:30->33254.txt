RAJKOT: Villagers in Amreli district have expressed their anguish over the apathy shown by   towards a lion and a   that are injured for the last few days.

 The wild cats were spotted near Surajbadi dam of Savarkundla taluka. The villagers informed the forest department officials about their condition as the lioness was seen limping heavily, while the lion had scratch marks on its foot. However, no action has been taken in this regard in the last 12 days, the villagers said.
 
 The locals have captured the pictures and videos of the lion and lioness.   said, “We spotted this lion couple in this situation 12-13 days ago and informed the forest officials. But they did not provide them any treatment. This is the case of utter callousness and it seems that lions are at the mercy of forest officials.”
 
 When contacted, Dr T Karuppasamy said, “ I have come to know about the injured lions and I have instructed my staff to provide them treatment immediately. I have sent the team of forest officials and doctors. They are roaming around in the area and therefore it will take us time to rescue them. The lioness is weak by birth, but we are trying to provide medical treatment as soon as possible.”
