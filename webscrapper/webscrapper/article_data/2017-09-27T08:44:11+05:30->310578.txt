HYDERABAD: Historians from the city have found   of Palaeolithic age at the site of one of the highest waterfalls in the forest area of  .
The site is close to Charla which has not been much explored due to Maoist presence.
 
 Historian Dyavanapalli Satyanarayana, who visited the   in deep forests of   in the borders of Chattisgarh, says that the waterfall will be about 700 feet in height .
 
 “The waterfall is named Gaddalasari as eagles fly high on it. It could be one of the highest waterfalls on par with those in Meghalaya and Karnataka. The waterfall area was a shelter to prehistoric people thousands and thousands of years ago.Based on the stone tools (pebbles, fakes and blades), they belong to three successive ages ­ Lower Palaeolithic, Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic. Prehistoric people lived there right from at least 11.25 lakh years to 20,000 years BC. These dates are estimated by collaborating the evidence found here with the evidence found and interpreted by archaeologist Thakur Raja Ram Singh," said D Satyanarayana.
 
 According to Satyanarayana, Singh found similar structures, floors and bunds in Wankdi, Nirmal District near Ghanpur waterfall and stated then that these structures adjacent to the hill were used as windscreen or flood breaks." Singh previously found structures similar to this on the other side of Godavari river in Selibaka and treated the floors as tool-manufacturing sites.
 
 “Singh also reported some more such sites in Cherla area and elsewhere and opined that the prehistoric people used the floors to cut and clean the bodies of the hunted animals during summers near the water pools. The same description applies to this prehistoric site of Gaddalasari," said Satyanarayana. Historians have now asked the government to preserve the stone age tools and also improve access to the waterfalls for tourism purpose.
