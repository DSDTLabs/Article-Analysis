NOIDA: The transport department will inspect nearly 500 school   owned by various   in   on Saturday.

 Those   that did not participate in the inspection held on the ground behind Prakash hospital in Sector 33 last Sunday have been directed to send their buses for checking on Sunday, failing which the buses will be seized, officials said.
 
 As the schools had cited late information as the reason for not participating in the checking drive, the department has asked the education department to send prior intimation to the schools so as to avoid such excuses. 
 
 Only 306 buses of over 1,000 school-owned buses could be inspected on April 8.
 
 There are about 1,700 school-owned buses registered with the transport department, out of which over 1,000 belong to Noida schools while the remaining belong to schools of Greater Noida, Dadri and Jewar.
 
 The check on the school buses started after Uttar Pradesh transport minister Swantantra Dev Singh directed transport department officials to check the school-owned buses for any non-compliance with Supreme Court guidelines for such buses.
 
 Saturday’s checking drive will start around 8 am on the ground opposite to the fire station near India Expo Mart.
 
 “We have asked the district inspector of schools (DIOS) to send emails to the principals of all private and government schools about the compliance and fitness check for the school buses slated for Saturday,” assistant regional transport officer S K Singh told TOI.
 
 “Any school that fails to send its buses for the check on Saturday and those who had skipped the drive last Sunday have been asked to come on Sunday. In case, they still fail to do so, the buses will be penalised and seized,” he added.
