LUCKNOW: Accused in the   case Dr  , who was to leave for   on Friday to "serve" patients struck by   virus, has been asked by the Kerala government to postpone his visit. 

 On Tuesday, the chief minister's office in Kerala had accepted Dr Khan's request to volunteer to serve patients in the area where the deadly virus has claimed 11 lives. In a social media post earlier the same day, he had expressed his willingness to serve patients. 
 
 Dr Khan had reached Lucknow on Friday morning to embark on his journey to Kochi and onwards to Government Medical College, Kozhikode.
 
 Dr Khan said he was "really, really upset" on being asked to stay but would be on call if required. He said, "The additional private secretary to Kerala CM called me on Friday morning, requesting me to hold my trip for a couple of days. He said the central government was sending a team of experts from   and that outside interference other than their team is being frowned upon. UP government might also have a role to play in not letting me go there to serve."
 
 An official from the CMO in Kerala told TOI, "Specialists of infectious diseases on the ground and doctors associated with the Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter believe that their priority is to make Kerala Nipah-free and that Dr Khan's intervention as a paediatrician would not be of much medical help, as much as it will bring a political colour (to the issue). The concern was conveyed to the CM too and while he and the central government team working on the situation said that Dr Khan is welcome to Kerala any time he wants, the situation is currently being controlled actively."
 
 Dr Khan is among the nine accused in the oxygen supply tragedy at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College in August 2017 that took lives of at least 30 children. He was granted bail in a medical negligence case last month.
