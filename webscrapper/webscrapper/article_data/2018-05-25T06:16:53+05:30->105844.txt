HYDERABAD: Trouble broke out at the Government Maternity Hospital, Petlaburj, on Thursday after family members of a pregnant woman protested saying she died after doctors operated upon her at the hospital bed instead of doing the procedure at the operation theatre. 

 
 
 Shaheen, wife of Md  , collapsed soon after surgery, but Dr  , who carried out the operation, said that was the only option left to save the unborn child as the woman suffered cardiac arrest and was collapsing. Her family, however, blamed the hospital for the woman’s death. Though the incident occurred on Monday, it came to light on Thursday after an altercation between doctors and Imran.
 
 A police team from Charminar visited the hospital for investigation after child rights group   demanded an inquiry into the incident. “There was negligence on the part of the hospital doctors. They did not treat my wife properly. 
 
 When I took my wife to the hospital for admission, we were asked to return after eight-10 days. We reached home and she had to be rushed back when she complained of extreme pain,” recalled Imran, a bike mechanic. “The hospital was reluctant to take her in and did not give her  . They were not updating me on her condition and later said that she suffered fits. I was told to arrange blood and by the time I did she had passed away,” he added. He also said there was an altercation between   and his family.
