   by Future

 Hip hop/Trap 
 
 Politically incorrect and coming from the streets, this is rapper Future’s sixth album. Although the lyrics are shocking, provocative, misogynistic and drug fuelled, this is nothing new if you’ve followed the rapper’s previous works. This is Future doing what he has done the last four times in his albums already — dealing, wheeling, womanising and popping pills. Sure, he’s a prolific rapper, considering he released five mixed tapes along with four albums since he entered the rap game in 2012, but this album is repetitive.
 
 His trademark auto-tuned rap is there and so are the sick tap beats, cowbells and flutes. The album does have a handful of certified bangers, but they are too few and don’t stand out. Some guilty pleasure inducing tracks are ' ' with the rapper’s inimitable rhyming style. There’s also ' ', where he again launches into misogyny and drags on  . Other bangers in the 17-song-long album are ' ' with DJ Spinz and 'Feds Did A Sweep' which provide a more human side of the Trap king. So, if you can handle the super political incorrectness and misogyny by Future, go grab it.
