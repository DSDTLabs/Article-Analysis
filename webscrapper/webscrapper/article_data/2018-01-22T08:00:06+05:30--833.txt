LUCKNOW: The city is likely to get around 700 motorcycle taxis by the end of this month. Lucknow divisional commissioner   has cleared a proposal by   and Uber to operate two-wheeler taxis which, for the time being, are likely to be as expensive, or maybe more, than cabs operated by the same companies.

 Under the rates cleared by the transport department, the first km will cost Rs 8.70 while every 500 metres thereafter will be Rs 4.10. Currently, under a scheme being operated by Uber, a ride of up to 5km costs around Rs 49. Ola's Micro service costs Rs 6 per km, as stated on the company's app.
 
 "Uber and Ola had written to us for licenses and we have given them clearance. They are operating a similar service in Noida and   and we have allowed them to operate on exactly the same conditions under which they have been given licenses to operate there," said Garg.
 
 Sources said that the clearance for the service was given keeping in mind the upcoming Investors' Summit that is scheduled in the city in February.
 
 Secretary of the regional transport authority and RTO Lucknow, AK Singh, said that 500 licenses would be issued to Ola and another 200 to Uber. "We may think of issuing licenses, especially for women, if we see that there is demand for this service," he said.
 
 Under the state transport authority rules, the motorcycles can be of any colour other than red, black and maroon. The bike driver can carry only one passenger at a time and will have to provide a helmet to the passenger. Bookings for the bike cabs will be made through the phone apps of the two companies. The bikes that will be registered for the service cannot be more than two-year-old.
