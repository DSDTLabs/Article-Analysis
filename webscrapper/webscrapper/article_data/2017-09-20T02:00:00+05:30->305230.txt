PATNA: State health Minister   launched the second phase of technical support programme by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and CARE India on Tuesday. 

 Augmenting the sustained efforts to achieve key health and nutrition outcomes, the state government had signed a memorandum of cooperation with BMGF in 2010. Accordingly, a technical support unit (TSU) was established in the state in 2014. In the first phase of the TSU, it worked closely with the health department and integrated child development services (ICDS) on maternal and child health, family planning and nutrition intervention. 
 
 Speaking on the occasion, the minister applauded their efforts and said despite some positive changes in healthcare scenario in the state, there were many areas that would further be looked into in the second phase of TSU programme. He also stressed on the use of technology to bring efficiency in the health delivery system and connect healthcare workers such as ASHA workers to these technologies. “The human resource of healthcare providers in the state needs to be developed. We also require a system to train hospital management. Hospital managers have to be guided to maintain standard as required and good public relations with the people who visit the hospital. Supply chain system of medicines and medical equipment also needs to be monitored,” he said. 
 
 Health department principal secretary R K Mahajan said the health indicators of the state had improved in the last 15 years, but still required much to meet the national average in some aspects. “The immunization coverage in 2008 stood at 40%, which is now 84%. Our goal is to reach 90% immunization by December 2018 and be in the top five states in the country. We have set a May 2018 target for complete elimination of kala-azar,” he said.
