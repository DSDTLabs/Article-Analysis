AURANGABAD: A drunken cop was suspended on Monday for losing his service pistol in an alleged accident in Akashwani Chowk on late Saturday night. 

 The policeman has been identified as Amit Shivanand Swami (28, from Bhoiwada). 
 
 The commissioner of police (CP),   said, "The loss of government owned firearm is a clear case of gross negligence and just suspension is not enough. The policeman will be terminated in a day or two. He has not only lost the pistol but also tarnished the image of the police in the society." 
 
 He added, "Such cops are not needed in the police department." 
 
 CP   said that the circumstances in which the firearm was lost seems to be fabricated. 
 
 Swami, who joined the Aurangabad police in 2016, was attached to the headquarter of the city police and was given the prime duty of guarding an HC justice.
 
 The case was registered at the   police station and one suspect has been arrested in this connection. The arrested has been identified as   (20) a resident of   area while two other have been detained. However, the lost pistol is yet to be recovered. 
 
 Yadav has expressed his confidence that the firearm will be recovered in a few days as three suspects are in police custody.
