KOLHAPUR: The Maharashtra State   ( )   zone’s online transaction growth remained stagnant to a meagre 1.85% after introduction of it mobile application in June 2016 for bill payments.

 Out of the total bill collection, 4.21% payments were made online in June 2016. And much to the dismay of MSEDCL, the figure registered a marginal rise of 6.06% until December 25.
 
 The Kolhapur zone comprises Kolhapur and   districts with more than 18 lakhs customers. The online payments of bills are available to residential and commercial and industrial customers, while the farm sector has been exempted from online payments. The company has also made online payments mandatory for industries.
 
 Vikas Puri, public relation officer of MSEDCL, said, “The total number of customers, excluding the farming sector, is 14,80,145. The percentage of online payments when the app was launched in June 2016 was 4.21. The percentage increased from 4.21 to 6.06 till the last figures on December 25. The number slightly increased between November and December due to demonetisation. Now, as many as 89,082 customers are paying their bills online using facilities like net banking, mobile application and other mode of transactions.”
 
 A senior officer of the company, on condition of anonymity, said, “Larger chunk of the Kolhapur zone falls in rural areas where people are not too tech-savvy. We were expecting a big boost in online payments after the announcement of demonetisation. Even the government has been batting for cashless transactions. The customers still prefer cash over online payments, but we are expecting a good response in the future from our mobile app.”
