BHARUCH/SURAT: All industries will have to make safety training mandatory for their workers.

 DC  , director of industrial safety and health, said at a seminar here that the department would take serious action against the management of industries that do not take requisite steps to ensure occupational safety of their workers.
 
 The seminar on occupational safety and health was organized at J P Arts & Science College in view of recent fires and accidents in industrial estates like Dahej, Jhagadia, Panoli and Ankleshwar.
 
 “Most industrial accidents happen due to human error or negligence by the workers. The management too is responsble for not educating their workers about the hazards involved in handling of chemicals and its processes,” Chaudhary said.
