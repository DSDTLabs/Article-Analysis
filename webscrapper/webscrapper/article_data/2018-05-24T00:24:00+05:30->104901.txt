Kolkata:  , one of the leading electrical and appliances companies in India, has witnessed a dip in net profit to Rs 7.31 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 against Rs 38.5 crore in the year-ago period. 

 The chairman and managing director of the company, Shekhar Bajaj, argued that the fall in net is largely due to a one-time provision of Rs 89.4 crore with respect to its investments in its associate company Starlite Lighting in view of losses incurred by it due to steep fall in demand for CFL bulbs. “We have made substantial investment in the company in 2012 but in a span of five years, CFL becomes obsolete,” he said. 
 
 During the fourth quarter, the company achieved income from operations of Rs 1,606 crore against Rs 1,278 crore, registering a growth of 25.7% over the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal. The profit before tax (before exceptional items) was at Rs 133 crore against Rs 60 crore, a growth of around 121% over the corresponding quarter of the previous year. 
 
 “The benefit of Range & Reach Expansion Programme (RREP) is clearly evident from the topline and bottomline growth in consumer products segment, which is driven by strong demand for LED and a few other products,” Bajaj added. 
 
 Meanwhile,   has been elevated as the managing director of Bajaj Electricals on Wednesday. 
 
 Commenting on the development, Shekhar Bajaj said Ananth would look after operations while he as CMD would look after finance, HR and other aspects.
