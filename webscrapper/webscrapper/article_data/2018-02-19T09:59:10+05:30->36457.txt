KOCHI: A barn owl was rescued from the Southern Naval Command Aircraft Yard on Sunday morning after it suffered electric shock from a power line. The bird's right wing had broken, and it was brought to   sanctuary by evening. 

 "The barn owl, which is a wildlife scheduled category bird, was found injured and its skin slightly burnt at the yard. The bird was then taken to veterinarian Dr Sunil Kumar at Tripunithura, where the fracture and wing treated," PK Sajeevan, an honorary officer of the Animal Welfare Board of India, who first found the bird, said.
 
 The bird was subjected to a minor surgery and administered with IV, antibiotics and painkillers. 
 
 Upon informing the wild life department about the rescue, the officials first moved the bird to   and later to Kodanad Sanctuary, where it will be kept under care for 30 days.
 
 "As the barn owl is an endangered species, the bird will yield high prices in black market and thus it needs to be under the safekeeping of the wildlife department," Sajeevan said.
