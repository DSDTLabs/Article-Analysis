Visakhapatnam: The Human Rights Forum (HRF) state committee demanded CID inquire the custodial death of a 60-year-old accused in a murder case in Atchutapuram. The forum said an impartial inquiry will rule out departmental bias and the possibility of coercion and tampering of evidence. Further, HRF demanded adequate compensation for the kin. HRF cited section 175 (I-A) of the CrPC which mandates all custodial deaths be enquired by a   magistrate. It may be recalled that P Ramunaidu of Cheemalapalli village in Atchutapuram mandal allegedly committed suicide in the Atchutapuram police station on April 25. tnn
