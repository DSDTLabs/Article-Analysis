Vadodara: Power and automation technology major ABB group took a further step towards clean energy by inaugurating an innovative microgrid solution facility at its manufacturing unit in Maneja, here. The Switzerland-based firm is eyeing India as a potential market for the microgrid solution as there is huge requirement for electrification and the government too was pushing for renewable energy.

 “Growth demands power and access to clean, reliable electricity sits at the heart of India’s economic development,” said Claudio Facchin, president of ABB’s Power Grids Division. Company officials said that the microgrid that has capacity of 1.2 MW can power nearly 20% of their factories’ total consumption of 6.5MW. “We will increase the capacity of the microgrid in future,” said Sanjeev Sharma, MD, ABB India.
 
 The use of renewable energy will lower the facility’s carbon footprint by about 1,400 tonne of carbon dioxide per year and also reduced spend on electricity bills. 
 
 The officials, however, didn’t divulge the amount invested in the microgrid solution. When asked if ABB had approached the government for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, Sharma said that the company was interested in the project and was in touch with the government.
 
 ABB has 47 factories in India of which 15 are in Gujarat. A state-of-art ABB PowerTEC institute wherein a team of experts will provide training on advanced high-voltage equipment was also inaugurated on Thursday. ABB manufactures critical power equipment like transformers, high voltage products, motors, generators and turbochargers at its Vadodara facility.
