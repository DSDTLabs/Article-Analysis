Jaipur: The famous markets in the heritage   area will soon have   roads. The   (JSML) has decided to develop model roads in eight bazaars under the smart city project.

 The JSML has opened technical bids for the project and work is expected to begin in May.
 
 After vetting the technical bids, the mission will open the financial bids. Three companies have participated in the bids for the project.
 
 “Companies from Ahmedabad, Jodhpur and Jaipur have shown interest in the project. A firm from Mumbai could not participate as it failed to deposit the earnest money. We are planning to issue the work orders by the end of May,” said an official.
 
 The JSML has proposed to develop nearly 10km smart road separately in the Walled City area. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 16 crore.
 
 As per the proposal, the road will be equipped with smart facilities such as intelligent passenger system, smart lights, ducting system, bio-toilets, WiFi, etc.
 
 Other than these, it has also plans to introduce a smart passenger information system for Jaipur.
 
 Once the system is implemented through a mobile app, commuters in the state capital will receive the schedule, location and seat availability in   buses,   as well as information to hire cabs.
 
 The app—Journey Planner—is a part of many other JSML initiatives to streamline the public transport sector which includes integrating bus, metro and cab services.
 
 The app will give information about JCTSL bus routes, including that of private operators, frequency, timings and fare information. Users will be able to give inputs about trips.
 
 The app will also have the latest information on Jaipur Metro routes, frequency and fare. “The estimated cost of entire project is Rs 22 crore. The JSML has invited tenders for the same,” an official said.
