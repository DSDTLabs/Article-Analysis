Ahmedabad/Vadodara: Director of city-based Cube Construction Engineering Nilesh Gandhi on Wednesday applied for anticipatory bail in the sessions court on Wednesday. 

 Gandhi is one of the several persons named in the complaint of abetment to suicide of civil contractor Alpesh Thakkar.
 
 In his bail plea, Gandhi said that he had given a contract to Thakkar in 2013 for one of his projects. When Thakkar produced the bill, he was made a payment of Rs 1.9 lakh after deducting TDS. Within few months, Gandhi cancelled the work order since the construction quality was poor and Thakkar did not improve his work despite informing him, Gandhi stated in his bail application.
 
 “Even if the payment was pending, during these five years, Thakkar did not make efforts or act to ask for it. His behaviour showed that there were no pending transactions between him and Thakkar,” his application stated. Gandhi also stated that Thakkar’s wife had made the allegations though she does not have any evidences to show that her husband’s payment was pending. 
 
 Gandhi also told the court that the investigative officer too does not have any evidence to prove that he was responsible for Thakkar’s suicide. His plea will be heard on Thursday.
 
 Thakkar’s wife had alleged in her complaint that her husband had taken up Gandhi’s work at MS University’s polytechnic college for which he had to pay him Rs 71 lakh. 
 
 Besides Gandhi, 10 others builders have been booked by the police for allegedly non-payment of dues to Thakkar which led him to take extreme step.
