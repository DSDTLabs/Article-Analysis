CHARMINAR: Weeks before the onset of summer, residents of   have been facing a serious water crisis for the past 20 days. Water contamination, erratic water supply also pose a heath hazard.

 At least a kilometre from the majestic  , the Ghulam Murtuza Chowni, is a part of the   assembly constituency. With several residents on the streets, carrying empty pots and vessels walking on unpaved roads, the neighbourhood appears to be on the blind spot of civic authorities.
 
 Residents said scores of houses have been reeling under water scarcity. “I have been getting only 30 minutes of water and it can be in any part of the day or night.Other adjoining areas have no such problem. The water pressure is so low that all of us are forced to use pumps to draw water,“ said  , who works at a steel trunk painting unit.
 
 Others pointed out that despite public representatives and locals writing letters regarding the issue, the Hy derabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewage Board (HMWS&SB) had done precious little to solve the problem. “Letters have been sent by the MLA and other leaders but nothing seems to work. The water we get is often contaminated.Something must be done urgently,“ said Mohammed Arif, a resident of the area.
 
 For their part, officials of the HMWS&SB admitted that they are aware of the problem. Speaking to TOI, O & M division II general manager P   said that Ghulam Murtuza Chowni, which has around 150 houses, is a `tail-end' area which receives water supply after neighbourhoods like Charminar which is under the O & M division I.
 
 “The inflow into the Jahanuma reservoir is poor. If more water is received, then we will be in a position to do something. We are forced to reduce the duration of water supply in the area,“ he said.The bore-wells dug in the area do not seem to help, he added. “The lanes are narrow which makes it difficult for water tankers to enter,“ he said.
