GURUGRAM: It could be a coincidence or a well-planned act of money laundering. Just a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation, a little-known company with a paid-up capital of only Rs 1 lakh purchased a land in Gurgaon for over Rs 30 crore from another unknown company. The high-value transaction between the two companies has now come under the scanner after a complaint was lodged at CM window and with the district administration.

 TOI has accessed documents that show that   Pvt Ltd purchased around seven acres of land in Gurgaon’s Chauma village for Rs 30.96 crore from Vichitra Prestressed Concrete Pvt Ltd vide registered sale deed No 24071 on December 15, 2016. According to data available on the website of Union ministry of corporate affairs, the paid-up capital of Mask Realcon is Rs 1 lakh. Also, Mask Realcon is a subsidiary of Aakshi Realtors Pvt Ltd, a holding company with a paid-up capital of Rs 11 lakh.
 
 “In view of the documents and the Union ministry’s data, it appears that Mask Realcon has not purchased the said land out of its own resources. It is essential that a thorough inquiry be conducted so as to ascertain the exact source of funds and the original people behind the purchase of the said land,” said the complainant.
 
 When contacted, deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh said he would look into the complaint. “I will direct the official concerned to go through the details of the land deal,” he said.
 
 However, a representative of Mask Realcon has denied any financial irregularities in the land dealing and claimed it was done as per government norms. “No cash was involved in the dealing; all payments were made through cheque. So there is no question of any financial irregularities,” he said. “Paid-up capital is just like registration amount and it has nothing to do with the transactions of the company,” he added.
