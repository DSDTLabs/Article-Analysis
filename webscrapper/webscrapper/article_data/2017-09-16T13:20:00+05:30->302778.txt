Kiku was arrested for mimicking Dera Sacha Sauda chief   on his show and for allegedly hurting the sentiments of the self-styled godman's followers in 2016. Kiku was sent to a 14-day judicial custody and he later had to apologise for his act. A year later, when the Dera Sacha Sauda chief has been sentenced to 20 years in jail by a special CBI court, Kiku says that he just can say that "it is all karma."

 He adds, "Last year, when this happened there was no time to react. I was shooting for the film then, I went to Mumbai to shoot for TV show with Akshay Kumar and once I finished the shoot, I was told that cops were waiting for me for an hour. They didn't disturb me while I was shooting, they were kind otherwise they would have arrested me from the stage. It is not a pleasant memory for sure. After recent news, what comes to my mind is that karma comes back to you. I have been requesting people that stay cool, donâ€™t take everything so personally so easily. We did something in fun zone, ye to wahi hai ki aap intezaar kar rahe hai ki aap mere bare me kuch bolo aur mai ladne aata hu, itne defensive hoke mat raho, thoda chill karo. In our country thoda personally lene ke liye thoda zyada tayyar rehta hai sab, so I only request people that aisa na kare."
