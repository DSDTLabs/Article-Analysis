NEW DELHI: The BJP-led   government's decision to provide pension to Muslim women divorced through   came in for severe condemnation from   and   (M) on Friday even as Bharatiya Janata Party maintained that there was nothing wrong with the move. 

 Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said discrimination among destitute women on the grounds of religion was unfair and unwarranted. "Why should destitute or abandoned Hindu women be not given similar pension and assistance by the state government?" he asked.
 
 CPM politburo member Brinda Karat went a step ahead and said the Assam government had proved itself "unlettered" in the area of women's rights and had turned the 'sabka saath sabka vikas' slogan on its head.
 
 "The percentage of Hindu women abandoned or deserted without maintenance or support is much higher than among Muslim women. The Left Front government in Tripura supports single women-led families. The Assam government should also support women across castes and communities. Instead, it is trying to give this a communal colour. Patriarchal practices exist in all societies including among Hindu men. There should be no discrimination in support," Karat told TOI. 
 
 She also objected to linking women's rights and empowerment with population policies. "Women's empowerment movements have fought against women's rights being linked to population policies because they have challenged the concept of bodily autonomy. Linking women's rights with population has been rejected ages ago in official government population policies. For the Assam government to try and bring it back through these drafts is totally unacceptable," she said. 
 
 The BJP, however, said it was a welcome step. "Any step taken by a government for citizens who require assistance is a welcome step and we expect that the Assam government initiative will be a trendsetter," BJP spokesperson   said.
