Apart from being a weekend, these city youngsters had one more reason to party like crazy last Saturday night — it was New Year’s Eve and they welcomed 2017 with this bash. Dressed in party colours like red, black and gold, the gals who turned up for the party upped the fashion quotient. Actress Sonia Agarwal was one of the headturners at this party. In a golden one-shoulder dress, she looked ravishing. Esha, in a red party dress, too, grabbed the attention of the shutterbugs and she was all happy as the cameras zoomed in on her. The fantastic four — Deepa, Akash, Shrenik and Shefali — enjoyed each other’s company and were in high spirits throughout the party. The DJ was at his best and never let the party mood drop as he kept churning out upbeat numbers back to back.
