GURUGRAM: The ongoing   in the   of the   underpass has left the   miffed. The officials have given out a stern warning to the Haryana government to clear the land of the   within 3-4 weeks or they would pull out from the project. 

 The move comes after a petitioner got a stay order from the district and sessions court and stalled the   of the petrol pump from Iffco Chowk to Sector 42. 
 
 The NHAI chairman, Deepak Kumar, in a letter (dated March 7), informed Haryana government’s chief secretary Deepinder Singh Dhesi that the delay in the shifting of the petrol pump had held up the project for long. Kumar reminded the chief secretary that while handing over the project to NHAI the state government had assured them that they could carry out the project without any hurdle. 
 
 “Under the conditions of the contract, any further delay in handing over of the site would result in financial contractual implications for NHAI. In the circumstances, NHAI may be forced to close the work at this stage, in case site is not clear in another 3-4 week’s time,” the letter states. Only 8% work left in the project is due to delay in shifting of the fuel station, the letter adds. 
 
 Ashok Sharma, the project director of NHAI in Gurugram said, “The work can be completed within one month of the removal of the petrol pump. NHAI chairman has mentioned in his letter that the construction agency was given 30 months’ time to complete the underpass, but the agency completed 92% of the record in 13 months.”
