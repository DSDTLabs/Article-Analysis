BENGALURU: About 30 varieties of mangoes, the ‘king of fruits’, will be up for grabs at   from Friday. Also as part of the three-week annual Mango and  , the department of horticulture and the Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Corporation Ltd will set up 22 stalls to display and sell the fruit at major   stations.

 
 Over 90 stalls — 80 for mango growers and 10 for jackfruit growers who will sell 12 varieties of the fruit — will be set up in Lalbagh.
 
  
  
 “Last year, we had stalls at four Metro stations and the response was good,” said an official. Ten stalls will also be set up at the   and Industry (FKCCI) office on   and 10 at  . For the first time, a kiosk will be set up at Lalbagh, allowing visitors to rate the quality of fruits sold and maintenance of cleanliness at the mela. Bills will be generated through text messages.
 
 
 
 Mangoes are grown on 1.78 lakh hectares of land in the state, with an estimated yield of 12-14 lakh tonnes. However, since this is an 'off' year, with chances of delayed fruiting, the yield has fallen to 8-10 lakh tonnes. This is the reason why the mango mela, which is usually scheduled in the first week of May, is being held now. Officials say the retail prices at the mela will be decided by Thursday evening.
 
 The board, which was hoping to increase exports this year, will now have to wait another year. “Last year, we had exported nearly 10,000 tonnes of mangoes to various countries including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the US,” said KM Parashivamurthy, additional director, horticulture department.
 
 “Since then, the number of farmers who acquired the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certificate, which is necessary to export produce, has increased from 200 to 1,200. So we were hoping to increase exports, but this may not be possible this year,” he added.
