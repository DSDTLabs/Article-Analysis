With an eye on 2018 election, the government on Wednesday may have announced a slew of projects to provide Bengalureans a better quality of life, but they are not necessarily all encompassing. In fact, compared to last year, overall allocation for the city dipped this time. While a number of road development projects have been announced, water supply and   were just rephrased in the budget speech of 2017-18. Surprisingly, garbage, probably one of Bengaluru’s most lingering woes, found no mention.

 A sum of Rs 5,866 crore has been earmarked for various road development works to be undertaken by BBMP,   and stormwater drain projects by BWSSB. However, in 2016-17, the total allocation for the city was more than Rs 8,444 crore, including Rs 1,000 crore from CM’s Nagarothana Scheme, Rs 2,158 crore for Special Investment Plans; also, the BBMP had got an exclusive Rs 4,222.73 crore to take up various development works in the city.
 
 The chief minister who had proposed to widen Hebbal flyover by adding another lane (from airport to city) ahead of the 2016 BBMP election, kept his commitment by announcing that Rs 88 crore will be allocated to BDA for the project. Additionally, an underpass will be built at the Hebbal Outer Ring Road junction to decongest traffic.
 
 The journey ahead: Although there was no mention of the 83km elevated road network project in this budget, the government announced development of 43 major roads stretching 80km, complete with white topping (concretizing) and also improving pedestrian facilities at a cost of Rs 690 crore. Apart from this, the budget also saw a mention of the third phase of road development through TenderSURE model for 25 roads in the city's central business district at a cost of Rs 250 crore.
 
 However, the CM and his team didn’t quite address Greater Bengaluru’s water woes, except that the Cauvery fifth-stage water supply project will commence in 2017. The project is envisaged to supply 775 million litres of water to Bengaluru every day in future. All other projects have been simply reiterated and rephrased.
 
 Muck stops here: While the city is struggling with its growing garbage piles, no separate allocation has been made for solid waste management projects in Bengaluru. In 2016-17, Rs 500 crore was allocated to BBMP for this very purpose. Also, only Rs 300 crore has been allocated for stormwater drain development as against last year’s Rs 800 crore.
 
 While the announcement of 5,000 sites to be allotted in Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout is old news, the latest is that the BDA will build a road connecting Mysuru Road and Magadi Road (10.7km) through the upcoming Kempegowda Layout at Rs 350 crore. This year, the mandate for BDA is to complete building 3,000 flats.
