Shivam Mavi, the 19-year-old fast bowler from Noida who was part of the Indian team that defeated   to win the   U-19 World Cup on Saturday, returned home yesterday to a grand welcome. Shivam was overwhelmed by the grand reception at the Delhi airport. 

 "This is the first time that I am experiencing something like this. People have actually made all of us celebrities. Noida mein logon ne humesha tarif ki hai game ki, par isse pehle aisa welcome nahi mila. I am really overwhelmed," Shivam, who lives in Sector 71, said.

  Shivam added, "Everything that is happening today is new for me. We had worked really hard for the World Cup and when we won, I didn't check my phone on purpose. Pata hi tha ki bahut log baat karna chahte honge. We all played music in the dressing room and danced. Rahul sir ( , their coach) also enjoyed a lot on that day, woh usually yeh sab nahi karte hain, par us din woh bhi bahut khush thay."
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  Talking about the finals, he said that he did not think much about winning. "Aisa socha nahi thaâ€¦ bas jo preparation ki thi, wahi execute kiya." When we asked about his equation with his teammate  , the batsman from Delhi, he said, "He is a batsman and I am a bowler. Aisa kuch khas toh nahi hai, par bas dono apne game mein focussed hain."
