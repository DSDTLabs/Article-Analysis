NEW DELHI: The rupee on Tuesday fell 7 paise to trade at a fresh 15-month low of 67.20 against the US dollar in early trade. The currency slid on continuous selling by foreign funds in the Indian markets in recent weeks, a strong rally in crude oil prices, rising imports into the country and global uncertainty about Iran’s nuclear deal. However, the rupee recovered from the 15-month low and inched higher to close at 67.08 compared to the previous day's close of 67.13.

 
 
 
 
 * According to Kotak Mahindra Bank president (group treasury) Narayan S A, the rising price of crude oil — the biggest import item for India — is directly impacting the strength of the rupee. In addition, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net sold equities and debt worth about $3.5 billion since April this year.
 
 * Experts said, in addition to the domestic and international factors, political uncertainty around Karnataka polls and rising yields of sovereign bonds globally are also putting pressure on the rupee.
 
 * "The emerging market currencies are now playing catch up with some of the excessive losses seen in developed currencies ... Asian currencies have also fallen victim to the latest round of US dollar buying momentum," Jameel Ahmad, Global Head of Currency Strategy & Market Research at FXTM wrote in a note.
 
  
  
 
 * According to ICICI Securities analysts Amit Gupta and Gaurav Shah, other than the sharp rise in crude oil prices, the recent spike in global yields is also affecting the domestic macro picture to a certain extent. “Benefits of lower crude prices have been disappearing as oil appears firming at $65-75 levels. However, we expect most negatives to have already been priced in. As such, the (rupee-dollar) pair could consolidate in the range of 65.80-67.30 per dollar. Also, record forex reserves with the RBI may be utilised in the event of the next bout of sharp rupee depreciation,” the analysts said.
 
 * Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday, a day after hitting 3-1/2 year highs, as investors braced for US President Donald Trump's decision on whether to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, a move that could disrupt global oil supply. Global benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $75.64 per barrel, down 0.7 percent, having risen as high as $76.34 on Monday.
