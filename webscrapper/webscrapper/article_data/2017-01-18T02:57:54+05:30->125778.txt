Navi Mumbai: Over 800 trees, which are in the way of National Highway Authority India's (NHAI)   road widening project, will be cut. The civic tree authority has permitted NHAI to cut 171 trees and 671 are to be replanted. The stretch from Belapur Killa to JNPT will be widened to 6 or 8 lanes.

 Tushar Pawar, DMC (garden) said that NHAI had sought NMMC’s permission for cutting all the trees posing a hurdle for the project. The tree authority, after inspection, decided that variants like Subabul, which serves no purpose to environment, could be cut whereas varieties like peltophorum or ficus are to be replanted. “NHAI will replant the trees in a mass replantation around the holding pond in sector 26, Nerul, also known as Jewel of Navi Mumbai, “said Pawar.
 
 NHAI will also be required to look into the growth of the trees for three years. “Considering the scale of transplantation, NHAI will be required to seek horticulturists’ opinions to ensure that the trees are able adapt to the change,” said a civic official. NHAI officials said that they were working out the means to execute the process.
 
 Suggestions and objections were sought by   from the public prior to giving permission to NHAI but they received no response. Notices detailing the number and types of trees to be cut as well as to be replanted have been put up by the garden department. 
 
 Meanwhile activist are demanding clarity on the manner in which the notification was issued. “The notification should be made on appropriate channels that are widely known to enable public to give any suggestions or objections on such major decision,” said Nerul resident and nature activist  .
