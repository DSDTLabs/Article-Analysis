Sonu Gowda, Pramod Shetty and Avinash starrer Gultoo is inching towards finish line. The film, directed by Janardhan Chikanna, comes across as one that is in sync with the series of new age cinema that has hit Sandalwood lately. This one however brings with it its share of commercial elements too - a thrilller that speaks of rape, murder and mystery. Avinash plays a cop and his role is of great importance to the way the story unfolds. The film is currently being shot in and around Bengaluru.
