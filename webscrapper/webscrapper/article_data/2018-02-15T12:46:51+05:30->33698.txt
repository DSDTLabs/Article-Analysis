CHENNAI: The   has pulled up officials who were lethargic in running NEET centres for government school students. 

 Following TOI's report that most training centres were closed on Sundays and not all of them were equipped with videoconferencing facilities, government has decided to take action. Teachers of government-funded schools, who were trained to handle these classes, will be taking classes in the centres where videoconferencing equipment are not available at present, said a top-official from the school education department. "A honorarium of 350 is given to these teachers for working on their off," the official told TOI. 
 
 To address the problem of English-medium students, who were left out as trainers conversed in Tamil, the state has decided to conduct separate sessions for them. "Nearly 2,000 selected students will be brought to Chennai for an intensive training session after the boards. Free food and accommodation will be provided to them," the official said. This was among the suggestions by experts in TOI's report dated February 5. 
 
 Besides this, another 2,000 students will be chosen by the private firm organising classes in the newly established training centres and a crash course and special training would be provided to them.
 
  So far, more than 72,000 students from government-funded schools across the state enrolled with the 412 training centres, as per government records. But patronage is poor as the schedule overlaps with the exam dattes. 
 
  (CBSE) has announced that it will not include state syllabi while preparing NEET question papers, thereby indicating that   students would continue to have an edge over their counterparts from states like TN and  , studying the state board syllabi.
