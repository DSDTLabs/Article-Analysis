HYDERABAD: Teaching doctors (assistant professors and associate professors) at the state-run   who went on a mass casual leave on Wednesday called off their strike on Thursday morning after meeting the health minister, C Laxma Reddy. The minister, doctors said, assured them to take a re-look at the ‘retirement age enhancement’ issue and speak to the chief minister about the same.

 
 The protesting doctors, part of the  , have been demanding that the cabinet’s approval for enhancing the retirement age of teaching doctors from the current 58 to 65 years, be rolled back.
 
  
  
 
 This proposal to hike the age was floated by the Telangana Government Medical Professors Association (TGMPA) who feel that the move will help fill existing vacancies. “There are a lot of posts that are lying vacant. Teaching doctors are retiring, but the new posts are not being filled. Increasing the retirement age will address this,” said a member of TGMPA.
 
 But members of   (TJUDA), following a general body meeting held on Thursday decided to oppose the enhancement of age and demanded that the new recruitment of 478 assistant professors be completed at the earliest. “During the general body meeting it was decided that junior doctors will oppose the age enhancement decision as it will result in loss of opportunities for junior doctors who will be passing out. Also if imposed, the age enhancement decision will result in a gap of seven years in the promotion cycle for junior doctors as well,” said G Srinivas, advisor TJUDA.
 
 The TJUDA had also submitted a representation, on this issue, to senior health authorities previously and had said that expediting the recruitment of assistant professors (which has been kept on hold by the TSPSC for the last couple of months) will solve the problem of vacant posts.
