NOIDA: A 5MW waste-to-energy (WTE) plant will be set up in Greater Noida’s   in the next two years, Deepak Agarwal, CEO,  , said on Monday. 

 The WTE, which will treat nearly 500 tonnes of waste generated by the two cities of Noida and   per day, will be readied within 30 months after tenders are finalised. The plant will be established at a cost of Rs 190 crore.
 
 According to officials, at a later date, the WTE will be enhanced to generate an additional 5 Megawatt of power and will treat waste up to 1,200 tonnes per day. “Since no environment clearance is required for generating power up to 15 megawatts, we have decided to first ready the WTE. At a later date we will put in place a compost plant and a refuse-derived fuel plant,” said Agarwal.
 
 Agarwal has directed his team of officials to ready the bid document for the proposed project within the next fortnight so that tenders can be initiated thereafter to hire a private agency to put it in place. 
 
 “Our aim is to develop a financially self-sustainable plant that takes care of its own power requirement through energy generation,” Agarwal told TOI. “Once the proposed project takes shape, we will not only be able to reduce waste but also harness the energy from it and use it effectively, besides enhancing our environs,” he added.
 
 The project will be developed on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model in   village, where a 145-acre landfill site is already being put into place.
