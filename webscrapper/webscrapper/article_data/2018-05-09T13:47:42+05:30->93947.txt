TRICHY: Demanding the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission, a large number of members from the   (SRMU) from across the Trichy railway division began a hunger   in front of the divisional railway manager’s office on Tuesday.

 As per a decision taken at the all-India level meeting, the 60-hour hunger protest which commenced at 6am is scheduled to end at 6pm on May 10.
 
 Members from various sections such as  , Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Manapparai, Tiruvarur, Srirangam, Ponmalai headed by the deputy general secretary of SRMU, Veerasekaran took part in the protest urging for various demands. Thiruverumbur DMK MLA   visited the venue and expressed his solidarity with the agitating railway employees.
 
 During the protest, speakers opposed the Union government’s move to privatise the railway departments in a phased manner and demanded the withdrawal of the privatisation move . The protesters also urged the government to implement the national pension scheme without fail.
 
 Under the guise of reforms, the Union government has been creating an extraordinary situation in which rampant privatisation of departments is depriving lakhs of permanent posts in railways - by hiring contract labourers, re-employment of retired persons - without worrying about passenger safety, they alleged. The maintenance activities pertaining to passenger and freight services have been handled by mechanical and electrical maintenance staff. But the government was more interested in handing them over to contractors, they added.
