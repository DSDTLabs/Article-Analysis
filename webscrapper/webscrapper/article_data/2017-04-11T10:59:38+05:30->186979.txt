HUBBALLI: A bride in finery, hours away from tying the knot, vanished from a wedding hall in Dharwad on Sunday, even as hundreds of guests were eagerly waiting for her to arrive at the mantap. 

 The woman remains untraced, a family member said. According to sources, the hall was decked up with flowers and buntings, and relatives and guests were coming to the choultry to bless the couple when the incident took place. At that time, the priest was busy completing the rituals to set the stage for tying of the mangalsutra.
 
 The groom, his parents and the bride's family were in a state of shock when some women who went into the bride's room to lead her to the mantap couldn't find her. They searched the entire hall for the missing bride, but in vain. Left with no options, embarrassed parents of the girl and groom called off the ceremony and put up a board outside the hall that read 'marriage postponed'. According to sources, the bride reportedly sneaked out of the hall and got into a car waiting for her around daybreak. She reportedly left her cellphone behind in her room, an officer said.
 
 The gi rl is from   and the boy from Dharwad. The families are related to each other. The girl is an arts graduate, and the boy works in Bengaluru. The groom's family booked the marriage hall in December for the April wedding. 
 
 Bride's uncle   told TOI the pre-wedding rituals were conducted without any hitches on Saturday and the extended family members were part of the celebrations. 
 
 "After we learnt that the bride went missing in the early hours of the day, we met police officers at Dharwad's   station and brought the issue to their notice, besides providing the details of the incident. We haven't yet filed a written complaint yet since the bride's parents are still numbed by the incident," he added.
 
  Police sub-inspector S R Tegur said they will launch investigations after the family files a complaint.
