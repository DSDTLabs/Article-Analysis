CHENNAI: Police have arrested a nutritionist Rama Seetha of Perambur, based on a complaint from the   management, for claiming that former chief minister   had no pulse when she was admitted to the hospital on September 22 last year. Police slapped a case against her for spreading  .

 Her speech at a function organised by supporters of Deepa Jayakumar, niece of Jayalalithaa, a few weeks ago had gone viral on social media and WhatsApp groups. Following this, the Apollo Hospitals management had lodged a complaint with the Chennai city police cyber cell.
 
 Police registered a case against her under IPC Sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 153 (deliberately giving provocative statement with intent to cause riot) and 505 (statement conducive to public mischief). Police said that she had never worked in Apollo Hospitals. 
 
 Rama Seetha had alleged that the hospital shifted Jayalalithaa to the intensive care unit though she didn’t have a pulse when she was brought in. Rama Seetha also claimed in her speech that within 20 days of Jayalalithaa’s admission at Apollo, the arrangements for her burial had begun near the MGR memorial along the Marina Beach. Jayalalithaa was declared dead on December 5.
 
 During the police inquiry, she said that she made the statement with the intention of impressing Deepa and getting a party post in her political outfit. It may be noted that from the day Jayalalithaa was admitted to the hospital, nobody was allowed to see or talk to her except current AIADMK general secretary  , who is now in jail.
