BENGALURU: From early this year, players have spoken about the change in the nature of the 22-yard strip at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Once a batsman's delight, it has, in recent times, tested them. On Thursday though, the venue regained some of its fame as a bowler's graveyard.

 The batsmen, Australians in particular, had a sumptuous feast. The result: the fourth and penultimate contest in the India-Australia series turned out to be a treat for spectators in which the Australians scored a morale-boosting 21-run win. The victory came a little late though as India had already wrapped up the series 3-0 at Indore.
 
 Australia's skipper Steve Smith chose to bat and the opening duo of Aaron Finch (94, 96b, 10x4, 3x6) and   (124, 119b, 12x4, 4x6) bludgeoned a vastly-changed Indian bowling line-up en route to a record 231 first-wicket stand which helped the visitors to 334/5 Â­ a daunting target, but not one that appeared out of reach of India's batsmen. But with wickets falling at regular intervals, India finished their quota of overs at 313/8.
 
 Ajinkya Rahane (53, 66b, 6x4, 1x6) and   (65, 55b, 1x4, 5x6) put the team on course with their 106-run opening stand. Rahane, Sharma and skipper   (21, 21b, 3x4) fell within a space of 31 runs thereafter, setting India back briefly. Kohli's dismissal only mirrored his abysmal form at this venue.
 
 The clouds, which threatened to open up through the day, did so in the 42nd over of India's innings and halted play for 19 minutes with India two runs behind the DLS par score of 253. Kedar Jadhav (67) and Manish Pandey (33) looked like they would take the team through. But with Pandey and MS Dhoni exiting with the team needing 34 off 13 balls, the fast-emptying stands came as a prelude to the result.
 
 Earlier, Rahane fell trying to thump Kane Richardson over mid-off but miscued and holed out to Finch. Rohit found himself back in the dressing room courtesy a horrible mix-up with his skipper.
