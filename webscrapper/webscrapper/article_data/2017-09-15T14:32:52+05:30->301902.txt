PANAJI: The   (GSPCB), on Thursday, directed the popular   restaurant in Anjuna that has been under drug probe, to stop operations until such time that the board issues it consent to operate.

 The GSCPB had granted the popular restaurant consent to operate on March 3, 2016, which was contested by activist Kashinath Shetye.
 
 Shetye raised the issue about structure’s legality, alleging it was built on sand dunes. Shetye filed the complaints before Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA), GSPCB as well as the local panchayat, in 2015. He had also questioned the documents submitted by the respondent in support of his structure, alleging they were forged. 
 
 Before revoking the consent to operate granted to the restaurant, GSPCB heard Shetye and respondent Linnet Nunes on the direction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), western zone bench, at Pune.
 
 The GSPCB has not taken into account other issues raised by Shetye as they are sub judice.
 
 The order, issued by scientist B of GSPCB, Dr Mohan Girab, stated: “The said issues are not being looked into at present and both parties are free to approach the GSPCB’s office once the competent authority arrives at their findings.”
 
 Curlies, a popular   in Anjuna, has been in the news for a month-and-a-half. In August, the owner of the restaurant, Edwin Nunes was arrested after one of his restaurant staff was taken into custody for possessing narcotics.
 
 Subsequently,   and drugs administration (FDA) ordered closure of the restaurant after it was found to be operating in extremely unhygienic conditions and for contravening provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act.
 
 It was allowed to reopen a few days later, but only after the operator corrected deficiencies, director, FDA, Salim Veljee, said.
