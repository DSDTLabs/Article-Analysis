AHMEDABAD:   (GTU) imposed a fine worth Rs 1 lakh on KP Thakkar Polytechnic College in Viramgam in connection with a case of mass copying that took place during fifth semester exams in October. The results of 100 students were cancelled for the entire semester. Moreover, the varsity also ordered cancellation of the exam centre at the institute for another year.

 The varsity had formed a five-member committee to probe the case and the decision was taken in accordance with the findings and recommendations of the committee members. The committee confirmed in its report that mass copying had occurred at the institute. Senior and junior supervisors were suspended from examination services, following the varsityâ€™s decision.
 
 The probe committee also called 150 students personally to question them about the case. Since everyone denied allegations, the committee later took a decision by itself on available evidence.
