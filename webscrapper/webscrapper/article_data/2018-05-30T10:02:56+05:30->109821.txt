The   (GO) to shut down the Sterlite copper smelter unit in   permanently and its subsequent locking down are yet to make a positive impact on the families of some of those killed in the police firing. While postmortem was performed on seven of the 13 victims, an advocate speaking for the families of five of the six remaining victims demanded the presence of ballistic experts and one of the family members during postmortem. 

 
 With the GO passed on Monday, it was expected that the families might agree to accept the mortal remains by softening their earlier resistance. However, they were particular about the presence of experts during postmortem. 
 
 "Families of the deceased are still sceptical of the GO since in the past the factory had functioned even after the state government opposed it. Shutting down the   was our demand but the culprits behind the killings in police firing should be punished," the advocate speaking for the families of five deceased victims said while terming the GO as temporary relief. The families had sought neutral supervision during the postmortem and particularly, a ballistic expert, to identify whether the bullet fired was from a short range.
