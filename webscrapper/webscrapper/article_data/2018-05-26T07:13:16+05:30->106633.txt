PUNE: An agency appointed by the Maharashtra   Rail Corporation ( ) has marked 688 properties for demolition on the two Metro rail corridors.

 These properties include homes, slums and shops. Of these, 472 are located on the   section and 155 on the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor. 
 
 Officials said that all the properties will be rehabilitated. MahaMetro has planned a month-long baseline survey of every property in June, in which details of every property and its owner will be sought. MahaMEtro will chalk out a plan based on the survey. 
 
 Per officials, the same rehabilitation policy cannot be applied to every property. “There are many options — for instance, slum dwellers can be shifted to slum rehabilitation authority schemes. There is also the option of paying compensation, which will be as per the latest policy of the state/Union government and Metro act. The policy is being finalized,” a MahaMetro official said. 
 
 MahaMetro had initiated civil work on both corridors late last year. While the work on the 16.59km elevated-cum-underground Pimpri-Swargate route has been extended to Dapodi, work on the elevated Vanaz-Civil Court route — 14.67km long — is underway on Paud Road, Karve Road and along the   river in the Deccan Gymkhana area. 
 
 
 
 The work of laying foundations along the river is expected to get over by July. MahaMetro officials said foundations for 21 of the 59 pillars on this stretch have been completed. “Work on the 34 remaining foundations will be expedited. Additional machinery has been deployed in this regard,” an official said.
