KANNUR: Investigators are yet to confirm CPM leader Babu Kannippoyil was a victim of political rivalry.

 Babu, a former councillor of   municipality, was murdered at Mahe, Puducherry, on May 7 night, just before another gang killed   UC, an RSS worker, at New Mahe, Kannur.
 
 Separate teams of Puducherry and Kerala police have been probing the murders in close coordination, and sources said the probes were progressing in the right direction, though no arrests have been made.
 
 Puducherry senior superintendent of police   said they were probing Babu’s as a murder, and not exactly as a political murder. “Whether it was political or not is not considered now,” she said, adding that the probe has made considerable progress.
 
 Meanwhile, police sources at Palloor in Mahe said they would go ahead with the case against 500 CPM workers who had set afire a police vehicle, BJP office and also vandalized some houses and other establishments.
 
 Cases have been registered under non-bailable sections and notice would be sent to each of the identified persons, said police.
 
 In New Mahe also the probe is progressing into the murder of Shamej, said district police chief G Siva Vikram.
 
 “Though we have not made any arrest as such, we are making steady progress in the investigation, and all aspects are being explored,” he said.
 
 The investigation was progressing keeping in mind the political angle. Police, however, seemed baffled over the way Shamej was killed within minutes of Babu’s murder.
