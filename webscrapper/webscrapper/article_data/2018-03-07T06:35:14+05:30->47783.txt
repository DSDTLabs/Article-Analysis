KOLKATA: Next time you visit a ration shop, you might get the feel of a mall. With branded products on display, the 22,000-odd dingy   across the state will soon be converted into ‘cheap mini malls’. The state food and supplies department has tied up with a leading retailer from the country that will provide products of leading brands, at a price lower than the market rate.

 The process of converting the ration shops started at the Bengal Global Business Summit this year when the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with   — a leading retail supermarket chain in the country. 
 
 Principal secretary of the state food and supplies department, Monoj Agarwal, said, “We shall start with a pilot project at 2,000 ration shops in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, in three months. Depending on its success, we shall gradually make inroads to other districts.”
 
 According to department sources, around 800 brands are sold by the retail giant and it has agreed to supply 500 initially to the fair-price shops at 15-35% less than the market price. “The company representatives are surveying the ration shops in the district to find out whether they need to make any changes to stock the products,” a senior official end.
 
 Future Group zonal CEO (east) Manish Agarwal has agreed in principle following the proposal of the state government to supply different items to   shops at reasonable rates. 
 
 “We shall supply consumer electronics, foods and personal care product items,” he added.
 
  “Our primary objective is to ensure that people get branded products in their neighbourhood, at a price lower than that in the market. It will also be a stride in making the ration shops attractive to common people,” he said.
