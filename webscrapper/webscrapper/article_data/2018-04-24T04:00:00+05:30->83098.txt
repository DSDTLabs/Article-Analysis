Rajkot: Three out of the six persons, who looted a truck loaded with 11,700kg cumin worth Rs 14.5 lakh near Jetpur, on April 18, were arrested in a joint operation by the Rajkot rural local crime branch and Jetpur taluka police late night on Sunday. 

 The six persons came in a car and stopped the truck on the highway near Jetalsar village. They falsely introduced themselves as policemen and asked the truck driver Rajesh Tank to get down. 
 
 Three of the accused sat in the truck and told him that they were taking it to the police station for checking. However, three others took Rajesh in their car to a temple in Jamnavad village near Dhoraji and locked him inside a temple. Later, they all fled with the truck.
 
 On Sunday night, Jetpur taluka police sub-inspector H A Jadeja and LCB team raided a farmhouse owned by one of the accused Farooq Sumra in Padvala village of Upleta taluka and arrested two persons â€” Wasim Sailm Sumra of Ambaliya village in Junagadh district and Imran Jusab Khafi of Masitiya village of Jamnagar. Farooq was not present at the house when the cops raided.
 
 The entire cumin stock and the truck were found from the farm, said Jadeja.
 
 During questioning, the duo revealed names of Ibrahim alias Bhikhu Ahmed Sida, who was then caught from Ambaliya village by the Junagadh LCB. 
 
 Police recovered the country-made pistol and seven live cartridges from him. Ibrahim was booked under Sections of the Arms Act. The accused had brandished the pistol and threatened truck owner Tank.
