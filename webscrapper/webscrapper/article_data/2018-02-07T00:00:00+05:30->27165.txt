Actor   had a near-freezing experience while shooting for the song   from   in Ooty. Shooting for the song, says the actor, was not easy as he nearly froze due to the cold temperature. Prod him over his ‘freezing’ experience from the song, he says, “There is a sequence in the song in which my character is shown taking a shower. The shoot was planned at the end of the day. So, the production team had made arrangements for water heaters, since we were shooting in Ooty and the temperature was around 10 degrees. When we were about to begin the shoot, we realized that the water heaters weren’t working and the water was freezing. We had about 15 minutes to shoot. So, I thought, ‘Let me just do it and finish it’. However, by the end of it, I was feeling so cold that both my brother and father had to come to my rescue.”

 The crew, on the other hand, faced extreme weather conditions while shooting for the song Hele Meghave in Mahabaleshwar. “It rained heavily and we kept slipping while shooting for Hele Meghave; I even fell several times,” he says, adding, “We had to do several retakes and ended up shooting for close to six hours. I had to stand at the edge of a cliff, which was very scary as your mind starts messing with you after a point. Of course, there were people around me and Avantika (Shetty, the lead actress). The entire crew had a tough time.”
