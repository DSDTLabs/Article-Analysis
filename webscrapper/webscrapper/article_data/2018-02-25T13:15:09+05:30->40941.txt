 : Thank you to all my dear friends who thought of me this morning when 
  passed away. Thank you for gently 
 breaking the news to me. I would have hated to find out from social media, and you knew that. I still can’t believe I’m writing these lines. I’m sad, and emotional and feeling too many things. I’m going to remember her as my diva, the doll of a woman who made me laugh soooo much. I want to remember her just like that. Will dedicate my day to watch her comedy scenes and relive the moments. My condolences to her family. Ma’am you will always remain as my idol. I’m your craziest fan and will always be obsessed with you.
