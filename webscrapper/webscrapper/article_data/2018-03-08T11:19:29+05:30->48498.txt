TIRUPUR: A police team from Avinashi, assigned to investigate the death of a 19-year-old   girl in Bangladesh, found that her husband was a Bangladesh national, who had created fake identification proof to stay in India.

 After the team that returned on Tuesday from West Bengal submitted the preliminary investigation report, the Tirupur rural police submitted a detailed report to the state government saying that the case could be solved only with the help of the Bangladesh embassy.
 
 The victim,  , who was working in a garment manufacturing unit here, had eloped with Rimu Sheikh in 2016. Initially, her parents U   and Selva Gomathi of   believed that she was living in West Bengal. However, the couple migrated to Bangladesh, where   allegedly died following an abortion. The police team investigating her death found that Sheikh, who stayed in Tirupur for seven years, had submitted a voter’s ID in the garment manufacturing unit claiming that he was a native of South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal. Also, as per Devi’s request, her parents had sent Rs 10,000, which was deposited in the account of Sahidul Dalal, a native of Paraganas district.
 
 “The police team, which camped in WB for about eight days, found that Sheikh was not an Indian but a Bangladeshi. They also found that Sahidul Dalal of   district could be a middleman as he admitted to the police that once Rs 10,000 was deposited by Devi’s parents, he ensured the money reached Sheikh illegally,” a senior police officer told TOI.
 
 “Our team which was equipped with Bengali-English translator made Sahidul to talk with Sheikh, who was residing near Dhaka. In the phone conversation, Sheikh told him that Devi had died due to profuse bleeding after undergoing abortion for second time in one and a half years. Her body was buried as per Islamic customs,” the police officer said.
