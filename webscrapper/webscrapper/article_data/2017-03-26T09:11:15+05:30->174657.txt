JAIPUR: A filmmaker from Dholpur has entered the   for his short film ‘Shudhhi-A new beginning’ for being the first film to have an actual cast of police officers and prisoners who are serving life-term at Jaipur  .

 Sanjeev Sharma, the writer and director of the film currently based in Mumbai, has been organising theatre workshops inside the central jail.
 
 In 2014, Sharma decided to shoot a five-minute black and white film with the help of jail officials while conducting a week-long theatre workshop inside the jail.
 
 “The short film is based on the life of Mahatma Gandhi as a teen when he picked up bad habits. The movie shows that human beings make mistakes, but true salvation lies in realising them and improving ourselves,” Sharma said.
 
 The filmmaker’s workshop was also recognised by the Limca Book of Records in 2014. “There are 12 inmates and one police official in the film. The entire movie was shot inside the prison with the help of inmates who attended our workshop,” Sharma said, adding that several inmates had thanked him for the opportunity after the movie was completed.
 
 “It was really an overwhelming experience for all of us as. I received a very fond farewell from the inmates and jail staff,” Sharma said.
 
 Sachim Mittal, who was the then IG in Jaipur jail, said that the experience had helped inmates explore their passion for theatre and filmmaking. “Inmates showed keen interest in the workshop. We thought it would be a good for inmates to draw life lessons from Mahatma Gandhi,” Mittal added.
 
 Sharma said that he was planning to take his theatre workshop to other jails across the country.
