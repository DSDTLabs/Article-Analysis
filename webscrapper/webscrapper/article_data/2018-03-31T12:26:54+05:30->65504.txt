RAJKOT: A lion carcass was found from a farm in Gorana village of   taluka in   on Friday. Forest department officials suspect it to have died because of snake bite. The carcass has been sent for postmortem. The lion was two-year-old.

 Local villagers informed the forest department on discovering the carcass in the farm. A team of senior forest officials with veterinary doctors reached the spot and cordoned the area. 
 
 Deputy conservator of forests, Gir (East) division, T Karuppasamy said, “I have visited the place and we suspect it to be a case of snake bite. We have recovered some evidence from the spot that also indicate the same. The final postmortem report though is awaited.” 
 
 However, locals allege that the lion died due to the lethargic approach of forest department. Farm owner   claimed that when he saw the lion, it was alive. “As soon as I spotted the lion at 9 am, I informed the forest department, but the team of officials reached the village only by 12 noon and by that time it had died,” the locals allege.
