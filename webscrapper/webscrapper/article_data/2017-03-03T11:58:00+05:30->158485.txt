 is a busy man with his hands full. He recently wrapped up the shoot of Kabir Khan’s ‘Tubelight’ and will soon start filming Ali Abbas Zafar’s ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’. The actor has recently signed a film to be directed by   D’Souza. 

 
  
 The movie will see him play father to a 13-year-old girl, but he will also play a professionally trained dancer. According to reports, Salman is building his core strength right now, so as to build a lean body. He will lose weight to appear agile like a dancer. Salman is also undergoing training with Remo’s team, and they are monitoring his diet and workout exercises. Apparently, the film was offered to Salman while he was shooting for ‘Sultan’ and the director is elated to have him on board. 
 
 Talking to a daily, Remo said that it was a dream come true for him to cast Salman, as he is a big fan of the superstar. The film’s schedule hasn’t been fixed yet, but it is likely to go on floors after Sallu completes shooting for ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’.
