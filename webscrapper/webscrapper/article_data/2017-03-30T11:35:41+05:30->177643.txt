PATNA: Leader of opposition in the state assembly Prem Kumar on Wednesday accused the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance government of “appeasing” Muslims in its development policy. 

 It has become clear in the budgetary allotment made to fulfil the development aspirations of the Muslim minority in the state, Prem said.
 
 Accompanied by   MLAs Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo from the BJP and Lalan Paswan from Hindustani Awam Morcha–Secular, Prem was talking to newsmen. He said the budgetary allotment to the minority welfare department for 2017-18 was 254% more in comparison to the current financial year.
 
 In contrast, the budgetary allotment for the welfare of SC/ST sections has been reduced by 20% and that for   and backward caste sections by 22% compared to last financial year, Prem said.
 
 Prem earlier also raised the issue in the assembly. Parliamentary affairs minister Shrawan Kumar countered him, saying the   had raised the issue in the House earlier too and, therefore, there was no need to raise it again. The BJP members, however, entered the well of the House. 
 
 Prem told newsmen a delegation of the BJP MLAs and MLCs from Bihar would visit Lucknow next week to invite UP chief minister   for his felicitation in Patna. He welcomed reports of UP’s Hindu Vahini opening its branches in western Bihar districts.
