AMRITSAR: A car with a Jammu and Kashmir number plate broke through a police barricade in Pathankot on Saturday and tried to run over a policeman near Bhadrali village, creating panic in the area. 

 “It seems to be a case of cattle smuggling but investigations are on and we will get more details after interrogation of one of the arrested accused,” said Pathankot Senior Superintendent of police Nilambari Jagdalay. Three other occupants of the car are still at large.
 
 The incident has put security agencies in the area on high alert as the   was attacked by Pakistani terrorists a little more than a year back. On January 2, 2016, terrorists had waylaid a Punjab police officer’s official vehicle to reach the station and orchestrate one of the deadliest attacks on Indian armed forces in recent years.
 
 Jagdalay said that on Saturday early morning, a police party signaled a speeding car to stop near Sujanpur barrier but the driver tried to run over ASI Dilbagh Singh. The cops managed to stop the car after a chase and arrested one person identified as Vali Mohammad while three of his companions managed to run away. The Maruti Alto car has the registration number JK02BC-6512.
 
 Police officials have launched a search operation and alerted adjoining districts of Kathua in Jammu and Kangra and Chamba in Himachal Pradesh. 
 
 Police sources told TOI that intelligence agencies had been sending regular inputs about terrorists entering into Punjab from Jammu and Kashmir leading to more police check-posts being put up.
 
 On December 15 last year, Pathankot police had found an abandoned Maruti Alto car near   which is about a km from the international border with Pakistan. The occupants had abandoned the vehicle in the village and slipped away.
