BHOPAL: Flouting school bus norms will now cost educational institutions dear, with   issuing a stern warning that they will be disaffiliated. Cracking the whip against errant schools, it has asked them to be conscious of commuting students’ safety. It has also issued comprehensive guidelines, even asking parents to voluntarily be involved in the matter.

 A notification released by   on February 23 reads, “Recent unfortunate instances reported in the media about callous approach by certain schools with respect to schoolchildren going to and from school have again raised concern about their safety. The time has come to be sensitive to this serious issue and to take proactive remedial measures to ensure that safe transport for children becomes one of the paramount objectives of every CBSE-affiliated school.”
 
 It has strictly said that a driver who has been challaned even once for any offence — like overspeeding, rash driving — should not be assigned duty.
 
 According to the notification, management and head of a CBSE-affiliated school will be held responsible for any kind of accident involving a bus. Moreover, all the schools have been directed to appoint a ‘Transport manager’ who will be responsible for movement and proper upkeep of buses while ensuring that CBSE affiliation by-laws and   orders regarding safety of children are complied with.
 
 In Bhopal, school buses have flouted traffic rules in the past two months more than any other private vehicle. Traffic Police, Bhopal along with   (RTO) fined as many as 421 vehicles during this period. These include 188 school buses, 93 school vans and 40 school Magics, as per latest data of traffic cops. RTO fined over 30 school buses and also seized about 10 school-bound vehicles for breaching rules. The violations included parking on the wrong side, expired first-aid kits, overspeeding, no fire safety equipment, no speed governors, not wearing uniform and no vehicle papers besides bypassing other norms of school bus safety.
 
 According to the traffic department officials, some schools are guilty of permitting old commercial-turned-school buses to ply despite the fact that these are not fit to ferry schoolchildren. “After holding regular seminars, some of the institutions are now paying attention to safety of students. However, some are still breaching the norms. Traffic police are regularly conducting checks in this regard,” said ASP ( ) Sameer Yadav.
