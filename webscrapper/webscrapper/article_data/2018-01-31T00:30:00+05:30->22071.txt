Trichy: Unable to cope with the excessive waste produced at the banana auction centre, near EB road, Trichy Corporation on Monday installed a pulveriser machine designed to shred and discard banana stems in a few minutes. The discarded product could later be transported to the micro compost centres. Set up at a cost of Rs 3 lakh, the machine is expected to ensure hygiene at the auction centre where banana bunch gets piled up, taking up a large portion of the area until sanitary workers clear them. “With the pulveriser, we can shred the bananas and turn them into a powder form, which will be sent to compost centre for making manures,” a corporation official said. The machine was installed on an experimental basis and could be introduced to other places such as Gandhi Market, to process and dispose of the food waste. Sanitary workers had a tough time dealing with nearly 8 tonne of banana stem accumulating at the auction centre every day. Similarly, the corporation has established an open-air gymnasium at an expense of Rs 25 lakh near K Abishekapuram zonal office falling within ward number 53. Municipal administration commissioner G Prakash on Monday inspected the facilities built as part of promoting healthy lifestyle. This apart, a model urinal, for Rs 5 lakh, was opened near the Trichy central bus stand to prevent open urination. Taking inspiration from the success of micro-compost centres, the corporation had in February 2017 installed the mandatory onsite compost yard facility for hotels, educational institutes, and markets where more than 100 kilogram of waste are generated every day The corporation told the commissioner that since the inception of onsite compost yards, the number has grown steadily from a mere 22 to 47
