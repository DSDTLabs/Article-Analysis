MUMBAI: A single mother has moved the Bombay high court to challenge   to her   by the collector's office. 

 In a plea filed through advocate Pradeep Havnur, the woman, a doctor and professor said the rejection of her application for a reserved category caste certificate was "illegal."
 
 In its reply before the HC, a deputy collector said, "caste is carried from father to son'' and to issue such certificate paternal family documents are required. The woman, who belongs to a Scheduled Caste, had adopted a boy in 2009, but in 2016 when she applied for a caste certificate, it was refused. The officer reasoned that the "  is not regulated or mentioned" when it comes to certifying their caste. Her appeal to the district caste scrutiny panel also failed last November. An affidavit filed by  , deputy district collector maintained that based on documents "there is no provision to issue a caste certificate to an adopted son.''
