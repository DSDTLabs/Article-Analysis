Vijayawada: The cash registers of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) are ticking thanks to a massive   rush during the vacations.

 APSRTCâ€™s Vijayawada region is operating over 100 special services on weekends and also on days when weddings are being held in large numbers.
 
 Anticipating the demand during the summer, the Vijayawada region has made special arrangements to run special services. The Hyderabad route becomes a major revenue earning route in the summer holidays. Besides this, the Chennai, Bengaluru and Visakhapatnam routes have also seen an increase in demand from passengers.
 
 Speaking to TOI, regional manager of Vijayawada, PV Ramarao, said they have been running 85 special services on average during weekends in addition to the 200 regular services with a 42% increase in demand. On the Chennai route, the demand has increased by 133% as eight special services were added to the existing six regular services. On the Bengaluru route, two buses were added to the existing 14 regular services.
 
 The marketing department of APSRTC is keeping a constant vigil on routes where demand from people is on the rise and is promptly deploying special buses by opening reservations. 
 
 They are also keeping some of the buses on standby for current booking.
 
 Air-conditioned buses are the most sought after in the summer and almost all AC services are running with maximum occupancy. Though the special services are helping passengers, they have to spend 50% extra for special services. APSRTC officials claim that as the extra buses come back almost empty on the return journey, it is essential to charge extra in order to make the route viable.
 
 Apart from summer special services, APSRTC is running package tours to all major temples and tourist attractions. 
 
 People were given an option to book an entire bus on hire on their customised route or the package tours on offing by the state-run transport corporation.
