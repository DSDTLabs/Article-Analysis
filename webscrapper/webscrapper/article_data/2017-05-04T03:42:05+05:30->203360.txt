GURUGRAM: Huda on Wednesday issued a   to 17   in the city, being run within the jurisdiction of its  , to clear their dues and threatened to cancel allotment of land in case of non-payment.

 These liquor vends, according to Huda, have failed to   for years. The development body has to recover around Rs 12 crore from them on account of rent. 
 
 Moreover, none of the liquor vends, which have been issued notice, has applied for a new approval to operate from Huda land. All vends should apply for fresh Huda approval as per the urban development body’s amended policy.
 
 Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said authority formulated the new policy to ensure that money due to it for using its land is paid by the licencees. “Huda needs to generate resources and for this it is crucial that money due to it as per rules is paid. Also the vends need to take approval as per norms,” he said.
 
 Huda has also blamed the excise department for the financial loss. “Huge rent amount is due towards the licences for liquor vends. It is not being paid either by the excise department or by the licensee, due to which Huda is facing huge financial loss,” the urban development body recently said in a letter to the excise department.
 
 Huda charges 6% of government rate of allotted land as rent from liquor shops and 3% of government rate of land for liquor vends. Huda has leased out land for rent to liquor shops in the city, but for the past few years, it has not been able to recover dues from these liquor shops.
