Jaisalmer: Union minister of state Arjun Meghwal said efforts at a wide scale will be started for searching   River. Even efforts for forming Saraswati Vikas Board in Rajasthan are being made, like Haryana, and talks are on with CM Raje, he said.

 The Union minister said the task is important for our civilization and culture. A plan has been made to dig around 500 wells in Jaisalmer and Barmer in 2018-19 and DPR has been prepared. Bikaner MP and Union MoS Meghwal has come to Jaisalmer as per BJP state organisation plans.
 
 He said the search for Saraswati is on since 1870 from the time of British rule and lately our scientists proved that even now there is active flow of river in the area. In nation aquifer mapping, the paleo channel still exists in this area and the water is very old.
 
 The Central groundwater board will dig 500 wells in 2018-19 which will intensify the search for Saraswati and will also help in solving the problem of water in desert areas.
