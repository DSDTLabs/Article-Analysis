CHENNAI: Six months had passed and 36-year-old  , a north Chennai homemaker with a speech impediment, was still struggling to describe the lump in her throat to her family. The growth had robbed her of sleep. It made breathing and swallowing painful.

 At  , doctors who examined Rathi found the biggest tumour they’d seen lodged in a patient’s throat. A request by Rathi made the task of removing the 10cm-long growth more challenging: “She asked if we could undertake the procedure without leaving a scar on her neck,” hospital dean Dr   said.
 
 
 Surgeons in the college’s ENT department pored over medical literature and discussed how they could excise the cylinder-shaped tumour without opening her throat.
 
 “We decided to extract the tumour through the oral cavity,” ENT department head Dr S   said. The largest tumour that they had removed with the same procedure was 8cm long. In Rathi’s case, the tumour was visible through her mouth.
 
 On December 29, Rathi underwent a three-hour operation to give her a fresh start. First up was tracheostomy — surgery to create an opening in the neck for direct access to the trachea (breathing tube). A team of six surgeons then excised the tumour and slid it out via the throat.
 
 Three months later, the mother of two returned for a follow up. On Tuesday, she met the doctors who helped her breathe normally. “Rathi has any disfiguring incision mark,” Dr Muthuchitra said.
