PANAJI: In a bid to ease the pressure of serpentine queues at the regional transport offices (RTO), the state transport department will soon be installing a digital token system at its offices. Managed by the Goa Electronics Limited (GEL), the Ponda   will be the first in the state to have this system up and running.

 
 
  
 
 Under the system, an applicant can obtain a token from the dispensing machine installed at the RTO to get their driving licence, smart cards or any other RTO related work without having to stand in a queue. The token numbers will be flashed on electronic boards for citizens to keep track of their number on the waitlist.
 
 “Through this system, applicants will have an easier access to single window counters to avail services. The system will allow applicants to wait comfortably seated at the RTO for their turn or go out and run errands during the waiting time until it is their turn,” a transport official told TOI.
 
 The citizen-friendly token system was introduced at the transport department head office earlier this year, after a small cabin with experts from GEL was set up in the premises. They have installed their office at the   RTO on Monday.
 
 “We will be starting the token system soon after GEL operators are done with the setting-up process. Their role will entail feeding data into the system on our behalf,” an RTO official at the Ponda office, said.
 
 Following RTO Ponda, this system is likely to be implemented at other RTOs in the state. “This system will help us keep a headcount in advance of how many applicants are in line. GEL will undertake the data entry process, and provide them (RTO) with softwares and engineers. This will help the department with the smooth functioning of services,” said a GEL representative.
