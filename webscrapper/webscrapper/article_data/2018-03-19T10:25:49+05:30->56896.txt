 Traffic police and ambulance came and took control of the situation. The truck was lifted with the help of a crane.
 
 "Each sack contained 50kg of toor dal. They were unevenly kept in the truck which we suspect could have led to the vehicle to overturn," said a traffic investigation inspector.
 
 "One side of the truck was heavily loaded with gunny bags, while the other side was left empty. The driver felt too much pressure on one side," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, those travelling from   towards Chengalpet made most of the situation and made away with as many sacks as they could lay their hands on, witnesses told the police. 
 
 Some of them called up their friends to come with vehicles to take away the gunny bags.
