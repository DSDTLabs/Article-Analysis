New Delhi: A year ago, she lost her son, and now her husband. Before this elderly woman could come to terms with a life without her son, her 65-year-old husband was   dead at his shop in Begampur, Rohini, on Friday. No one has been arrested as yet.

 Ratan Lal Chauhan’s wife Radha said that she did not suspect the personal security officer ( ) of having a role in the murder. She said that her son’s killer was the mastermind behind her husband’s murder. 
 
 “The PSO went home earlier than his usual time only when he was asked to do so. On Friday, he left as he was feeling unwell,” said Lata. 
 
 Police said that CCTV footage of the area showed that two men stopped their bike in front of the victim’s shop, shot at him six times before fleeing. Chauhan died on the spot. Senior police officers said that they have identified the owner of the bike and he has been asked to join probe.
 
 A senior officer said that eight teams have been formed to probe the case. “The teams are conducting raids at possible hideouts of the suspects in Delhi, Chandigarh, Hisar and other places in Haryana. They will be arrested soon,” he said.
 
 On Friday evening, Chauhan, who ran a shop of disposable plates and glasses, was sitting in his shop when two men arrived on a bike and opened fire at him.
 
 Earlier, Chauhan and his wife were provided with police protection as they had received death threats. The couple feared they could be attacked by the same people who killed their son in March last year. The constable who was deployed as PSO for Chauhan was not present at the time of the incident.
