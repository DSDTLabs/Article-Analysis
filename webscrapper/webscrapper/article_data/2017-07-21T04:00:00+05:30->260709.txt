Vadodara: City-based non-governmental organization United Way of Baroda selected 106 less privileged students from the state this year to give them interest-free education loan.

 The loans will be provided to students so that they can pursue courses in engineering, pure and applied sciences, business administration among others. The organization in association with The Netherlands-based Stitching Fusion Study Foundation will support these students and mentor them till they complete education. As a part of its program, a mentoring workshop was also organized for 225 students from the state earlier this week which was conducted by city-based psychologist Dr Thomas Vadaya. TNN
