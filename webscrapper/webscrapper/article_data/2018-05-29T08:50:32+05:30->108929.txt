MYSURU: Criticising the previous Congress government for its failure to appoint vice-chancellors to some of the state’s important varsities, including the   (UoM), vice-chairman of the   Marithibbegowda, who is contesting the council elections from the South Teachers’ constituency, on Monday said, “Failure to appoint full-time VCs to seven universities in the state was the biggest failure of the Congress government.”

 Gowda, who spoke to journalists at an interaction organised by the Mysore District Journalists’ Association, said, “UoM is a varsity that has an international reputation. It has been without a permanent VC for more than one-and-a-half years. Congress has turned a blind eye to education.”
 
 The legislative council vice-chairman has been elected from the South Teachers’ constituency twice in succession, and is eyeing a hat-trick this year. “I shot four letters to the previous government urging it to appoint VCs to universities, but it turned out to be a futile exercise,” said Gowda, blaming the delay in appointment of VCs to the tussle between Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala and the Congress. 
 
 On the other hand, BJP candidate B Niranjan Murthy dubbed the move to bar part-time lecturers from voting in the constituency ‘anti-democratic’. Murthy also condemned the previous government’s stance on the new pension scheme for teachers.
 
 Congress candidate M Lakshman announced that this would be the last time he would contest from the South Teachers’ constituency. “All my life, I have been fighting for various causes related to education. I urge voters to support me so that I can continue my fight,” he said.
