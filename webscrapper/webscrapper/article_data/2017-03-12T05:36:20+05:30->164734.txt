IMPHAL: Smaller parties National People's Party (NPP),   (NPF),   (TMC) and   (LJP) have emerged as the   that threw up a fractured mandate on Saturday. 

 Sharing 10 seats among themselves, these parties will now be wooed by both Congress and BJP in their quest for power.
 
 The NPF has already announced support for a 'non-Congress coalition' government but whether BJP or Congress will reach out to it is up for debate. The party, which rules neighbouring Nagaland, is political pariah in Manipur as it supports the idea of Naga integration - a concept that involves Manipur ceding territory for a unified Nagaland.
 
 "It will be interesting to see if BJP takes support from NPF. The other small parties are expected to play an important role in deciding the fate of the next government," a political commentator said.
 
 The NPP, which is part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), will play the more critical role. The party does not have any compulsion to back a BJP-led government and will weight its options before announcing its allegiance. While senior BJP leaders claimed that NPP and LJP - both NDA partners - would back them, sources said state NPP leaders had already started talks with Ibobi. The CPI-led Left and Democratic Front, which had backed NPP in the polls, is also pressurizing it to join a non-BJP government.
 
 The LJP, meanwhile, had backed the Ibobi government in the last assembly. Party member Karam Shyam, who enjoys a rapport with the chief minister, is professedly unhappy with the central BJP leadership after the latter turned down its request for a pre-poll alliance.
 
 The Independent candidate, Ashab Uddin, is expected to side with Congress. Ibobi has already roped in minority leader from Assam Rakibul Hussain to persuade Ashab.
