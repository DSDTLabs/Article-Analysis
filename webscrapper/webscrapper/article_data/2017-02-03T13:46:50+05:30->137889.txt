MUMBAI:   demand in India witnessed a significant decline of 21 per cent in 2016 at 675.5 tonne, mainly due to challenges like 
  , PAN card requirement and 
  move, says  

 The gold demand for 2015 stood at 857.2 tonne, the   data revealed.
 
 Jewellery demand in the country also witnessed a sharp decline of 22.4 per cent in 2016, at 514 tonne compared to 662.3 tonnes in 2015.
 
 In value terms, jewellery demand saw a drop of 12.3 per cent in 2016 at Rs 1,38,837.8 crore, from Rs 1,58,310.4 crore in 2015, the report revealed.
 
 "India's gold demand for 2016 fell sharply, though the fourth quarter demand grew by 3 per cent to 244 tonne, due to softened gold prices that coincided with Diwali and wedding season. Demand was affected as the industry faced challenges, including PAN card requirement, Excise duty on jewellery, demonetisation and the publicity around income disclosure schemes," WGC Managing Director, India, Somasundaram PR said.
 
 This was not unique to gold but trade practices and embedded buying behaviour created short-term headwinds, he said.
 
 Looking ahead, these policies aim to deliver stronger economy and a more transparent gold industry, both of which should deliver significant benefits to gold buyers as well as accelerating transformation of the industry in becoming more organised, he said.
 
 Also, the rural community was the hardest hit by cash crunch, but the effect is likely to be temporary as healthy income and good monsoon will support gold demand going forward, he explained.
 
 Somasundaram said, "We anticipate that 2017 will see a demand range of 650-750 tonne due to the introduction of the 
  (GST) coupled with gradual adaptation to the previous year's policy changes." 
 
 Meanwhile, total investment demand for 2016 was down by 17.1 per cent at 161.5 tonne against 194.9 tonne in 2015, the WGC report said.
 
 In value terms, gold investment demand was at Rs 43,647.5 crore, a fall of 6.3 per cent, from Rs 46,597.3 crore in the previous year.
 
 Total gold recycling grew by 12 per cent at 89.6 tonnes in 2016, compared to 80.2 tonnes in 2015.
 
 "Due to the jewellery industry going on strike coupled with high gold price in the first half, recycling grew significantly, but it had completely dried up in the last quarter," he said.
 
 The grey market in November and December was lower and was 100-120 tonne in the entire year, he said.
 
 "Going forward, in 2017 we see the grey market in India disappearing if the government policy measures create transparency in trade and build better consumer awareness," he added.
