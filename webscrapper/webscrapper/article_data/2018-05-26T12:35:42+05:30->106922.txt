Summer time is filled with so many exciting programmes and   for kids who have been looking forward to spending their vacation productively. A five-day summer workshop for children was conducted in association with Cochin English   Collective at a club in Kochi. It was open to children ranging from 8 years to 18 years.
The   dealt with all aspects of emotion and expression including action and reaction, imagination, body language as a means of expression, script reading, voice modulations, language, sound and being a team player. 
 
 The workshop had focused on the interaction of an individual with the environment, people, and defining one’s role in it. Hence, there was an emphasis on learning how to express, explain and engage people with one’s ideas. 
 The organisers said, “We believe theatre to be an art as well as a tool for individual growth and inculcating a sense of social responsibility.”
  
 Overall it had been a good learning experience for these kids who utilised their time in learning more about what it means to be on stage, off stage and behind the curtains.
