Cannot say much about the others, but I am watching Novak Djokovic right now, and he seems in pretty good shape.

Under such circumstances, there is a lot of excitement about the prospects of Nick Kyrgios, the local favourite. He has been looking good over the past few months and had a good run-up to Melbourne by winning in Brisbane. There has never been any doubt about Kyrgiosâ€™ talent, the question was always about motivation and temperament. Kyrgios seems to be ready now. The other youngsters, Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev, are not too far off either, so there are quite a few youngsters to watch out for," he wrote.
 
 Becker however insisted that watching Roger Federer defend his Australian Open crown will draw eyeballs. Becker said Federer seems to be playing as well as he was 10 years ago and it will be quite something if Federer, at 36, goes on to defend the title.
 
 "All eyes however are on the youngest of them all - Roger Federer! He is playing as well as he was a decade ago, and is looking fresh and enthusiastic. It would be really unbelievable if he defends his title, but after last year, when he and Rafael Nadal shared the Grand Slam spoils, who is to stop us from believing in fairy tales," he wrote.
