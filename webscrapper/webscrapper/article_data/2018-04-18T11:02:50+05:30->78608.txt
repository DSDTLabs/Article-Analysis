Fifty-four BJP cadre were taken into custody by the police after they attempted to show black flags to MDMK leader  , who commenced his campaign against Sterlite at Kovilpatti on Tuesday. 

 Addressing reporters after inaugurating the campaign, Vaiko flayed Prime Minister, Narendra   that he preferred air travel to avoid black flags and he had betrayed Tamil Nadu in neutrino, NEET, Cauvery, hydrocarbon extraction and fishermen issues. 
 
 TNPCB denying permission to the factory is deception to divert people from the struggle, Vaiko said added that Sterlite should be closed once and for all. 
 
 Later in the evening, T T V Dhinakaran addressed a public meeting in Tuticorin. He said that the protest will continue till Sterlite is closed. Conniving with Modi, chief minister   and deputy chief minister O Pannerselvam are betraying Tamil Nadu. He also flayed Modi for visiting Chennai as though Tamil Nadu is not an integral part of India.
 
 Central government is forcing all dangerous projects on the state for welfare of corporates. Sterlite is one among them and it should be closed, else we will stage fast unto death, Dhinakaran said.
