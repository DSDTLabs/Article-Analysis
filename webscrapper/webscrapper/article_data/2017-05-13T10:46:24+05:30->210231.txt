BHUBANESWAR: On Thursday, chief minister and   president   had rued the fact that not all 30 districts could be accommodated in the ministry. A day later he tried to placate those he had left out during the reshuffle amid apprehension that more could follow Jayaram Pangi and into the BJP. 

 On Friday, Naveen met the BJD's popular tribal face and Rajgangpur MLA Mangala Kisan, who was the first to express resentment after he failed to make the cut in the cabinet rejig.
 
 "After the reshuffle process, I had made certain objectionable comments out of emotion. But I have discussed it with the chief minister and I have no resentment against the party any more," Mangala, considered a loyalist of former chief minister Biju Patnaik, told reporters at the state secretariat.
 
 Asked about the migration of BJD leaders to the saffron camp, Mangala said: "Those who have left BJD are like fish out of water."
 
 Mangala had earlier said that the development process in tribal-dominated Sundargarh district would be affected since no BJD MLA from the district was picked as a minister.
 
 BJD insiders said Naveen met some of the disgruntled leaders at his residence in the evening while he spoke to others over phone.
 
 When contacted, party spokesperson and Badchana legislator Amar Prasad Satpathy said people of Jajpur district had expected that one of their leaders would get representation in the ministry. "But the chief minister has to consider several aspects before finalizing his team. It is his prerogative and we have no complaints about that," Satpathy said.
 
 People in Sambalpur and Birmaharajpur had also openly criticised against the non-inclusion of their leaders in the council of ministers. Naveen would hope his damage control exercise manages to pacify the disgruntled leaders.
