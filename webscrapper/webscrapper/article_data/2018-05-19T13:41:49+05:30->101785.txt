 is on a fighting spree these days. The actress is undergoing a punishing Mixed Marshal Arts (MMA) routine to prepare for he role in the upcoming film 'Uri' where she plays an intelligence officer. The makers of the film want the actress to practice the routine so that she can match the body language of her character well. 

 Talking about it, Yami told a daily, "The prep work has only begun. MMA is crucial for the role I play and that's why, intense training is underway. A lot of time will be invested in it. The training will help me better my body language. Playing an intelligence officer on screen demands a certain degree of discipline [from an actor]. I need to have a certain kind of body language, one that's tough. These sessions will help me achieve that."
 
 In fact, Yami has already been doing similiar workouts to help her personally. She was quoted as saying, "I have already been training before, personally. For a film based on real-life military operations, I need to look a certain way. I'm happy with my fitness level, and MMA will make it better. We will start shooting in June."
