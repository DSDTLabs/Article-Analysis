Malayalam audience have seen actor   in the shoes of a cop many times before. He will again be seen donning a role of similar kind in his next Street Lights, which is a bilingual. 

 The official teaser of the film was out recently, and from the looks of it, one can expect a lot of action sequences, which will be riding high on his charm and eternally young looking persona. 
 
 Seen thrashing all the gundas in town in the video, it features a man asking the actor who he is, and when he says that he is James, he is mockingly asked if he is James Bond indeed. 
 
 As he beats up all the notorious characters in the clip, netizens are left wondering if the audience will get to see the actor in their much-loved avatar or whether it will be confined to him flaunting his swag and thereby striking a resonance of his recent outings.
