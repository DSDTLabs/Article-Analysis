NAGPUR: The state government has failed to submit its report on   lake   (Transfer of Development Rights) case in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court in prescribed time period.   then decided to hear the petition after summer vacations.

 Judges BP Dharmadhikari and Swapana Joshi on Wednesday adjourned the hearing to June 6. Activists TH Naidu and Prashant Pawar had filed public interest litigation in HC in 2015 alleging lake’s auction done by the district administration was against norms and demanded acquisition of the lake by the civic body.
 
  had started the process to issue TDRs to owners of the lake that too by changing reservation of the water body from Sonegaon tank to   and Beautification.
 
 Representing the petitioners, advocate A Kesari, on February 7, had objected to the change the reservation and granting TDR. HC then added the state’s urban development department (UDD) as respondent in the case and asked petitioners and NMC to submit their say with the UDD on March 5. “UDD shall take suitable decision in the matter within next two months after giving the parties opportunity of hearing and perusing record. Report thereof shall be made available for perusal of this Court on May 2,” judges said.
 
 NMC has put on hold the process to change reservation of the lake and grant TDR. “Further process will be done after HC’s orders,” an NMC official said.
 
 The Court of Wards coming under the district administration had auctioned the lake spread over 40.56 acres to two private persons on June 21, 1971. Following demand from activists and citizens, government had started the process to acquire the lake in 2000 but it is pending since for various reasons.
