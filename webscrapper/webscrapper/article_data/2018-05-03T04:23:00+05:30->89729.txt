Vadodara: Six employees of a Bengaluru-based marketing company were booked for cheating Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited (MGVCL) to the tune of Rs 88 lakh.

 According to the account superintendent of MGVCL, Messrs Subhash Project and Marketing Limited (MSPML) was given contract to operate anytime payment (ATP) machines at Indrapuri and Sardar Estate sub-division of the company in the city in 2007. Since then the company’s local officials have been responsible for collecting bill amounts in the form of cheques and cash from consumers.
 
 However, recently the officials of PSU learnt that there were discrepancies in the bank statements and the account statements submitted by MSPML officials to MGVCL. On auditing the statements, it came to light that there was a difference of over Rs 60 lakh in the amount that MSPML had deposited and the statements that it had submitted in the period between December last year and April 18. This difference was of the collection at Sardar Estate sub-division.
 
 Later, on checking statements of Indrapuri sub-division, there was a difference of Rs 28 lakh in the months of August and September last year. Police said that MGVCL officials had informed Rajesh Dubey, security officer of MSPML, that their ATP operator Sandeep Bhil had submitted duplicate bank receipts.
 
 MGVCL then approached the police with their complaint against the directors Shrinivasan and William D’souza, local branch manager Niraj Trivedi, Dubey and Bhil.
 
 Police said that the accused had swindled off the money by forging bank deposit receipts or by not depositing a part of the amount.
