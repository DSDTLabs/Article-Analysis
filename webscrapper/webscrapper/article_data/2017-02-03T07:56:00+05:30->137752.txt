NEW DELHI:   on Thursday opened admissions to 180 courses, including the six new programmes slated to start this academic session. Authorities said that they have tried to make the information gathering process easier for applicants by consolidating all admission data on a new portal handled by the Controller of Examinations.

 The applications for the undergraduate, postgraduate certificate and diploma courses will be available online till March 3. Information for admission to MPhil and PhD courses will be made available separately on the new admission portal at a later date.
 
 Saima Saeed, deputy media coordinator with the varsity said that even though the syllabus for entrance test for most courses has been updated on the prospectus, they might change following approval of respective departments.
 
 “The applicants must keep an eye on the admission portal for any news flashes on changes of dates. Applicants will no longer need to check for updates with every department as all information will be available on the new portal,” said Saeed.
 
 This year, the number of student intake is capped at 6,400 for colleges. Last year, the intake was 7,000, which included those admitted to its schools. The entrance exams are expected to take place over end of April, whole of May and beginning of June. Admit cards for those applicants eligible for the exams will be available online from April 8 to April 13.
