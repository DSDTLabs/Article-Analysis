On Friday , Presidency   chairman and MP  , in his inaugural speech at the bicentenary celebrations of   , said he wanted the historic institute to be a global university with Asian flavour, to achieve the status and compete globally , the state would have to play an enabling role, not an interfering one. On Monday , secretary of higher education department Vivek Kumar, however, said that some state-run universities may have taken the autonomous status a little too far.

 Without contradicting Bose, Kumar said he also believes that universities should be given full academic autonomy , but there should be some checks and balances in case of financial autonomy , especially where the funds are coming from the public exchequer. “ Autonomy to what extent is the question. If a university doesn't prepare annual accounts for 18 years, it is taking the autonomous status too far,“ he said. “If the state provides funds to varsities, we would want to know where and how the amount was spent. It is the right of people to be sure that the money was spent wisely. Moreover, the minister is accountable for any disbursal of funds and is often questioned in the assembly . Hence, the state should have some knowledge on the ways and methods in which the allocated funds are being spent. I don't consider it to be an infringement on autonomy . I hold this as my opinion,“he said.
 
 “Autonomy cannot be absolute and must go hand in hand with accountability,“ Kumar added.
