VADODARA: A   located on the scenic banks of the Narmada river that once hosted the likes of the Viceroy of India and author Ian Fleming will be turned into India’s first resource centre for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community.

 Rajpipla’s gay “prince”, Manvendra Singh Gohil, is developing the centre at a palace now named “Hanumanteshwar 1927”. This structure was originally built by his ancestors on 15 acres of land about 15 km from Rajpipla town, in Gujarat’s Narmada district.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 “My greatgrandfather,  , the last ruler of Rajpipla, had constructed this royal property. It has hosted many dignitaries, including the Viceroy of India, members of the royal family and Hollywood celebrities. I am developing it into a resource centre for the sexual minorities,” said Manvendra, who calls it an LGBTQA centre (where “A” stands for “Ally” — those who support the community in their rights).
 
 “The centre will impart skills in the fields of computers, English language and others to LGBTQ community members so they get employment opportunities and become financially independent,” said Gohil.
