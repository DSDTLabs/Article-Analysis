NAGPUR: The celebrated poets of the city took part in the annual mushaira — ‘Naye Chiraag Nayi Roshni’ — organized by   (NU) on its campus, Amravati Road, on Saturday afternoon. The daylong event was inaugurated by NU vice-chancellor SP Kane.

 The programme, however, did not have traditional shayaris based on love and heartbreak. It rather reflected contemporary topics such as unemployment, politics and women. Noted neuro surgeon Dr Lokendra Singh’s ‘shayari’ relating modern love to a mobile phone battery left the audience in splits.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Kane dwelt on his love for Urdu by reciting ‘Kabir ke dohe’. “My interest in the language stemmed from Urdu words which are often used in Hindi movies,” he said.
 
 “When Urdu words or sentences are used with any other language, the individuality of the latter enhances. Usually, if Hindi and Marathi are used in the same dialogue, it sounds awkward, but not in case of Urdu,” Dr Sameer Kabeer, organizer and professor of Urdu at NU, said. 
 
 Sharfuddin Sahil, one of the veteran poets, stressed on how shayaris are changing with times. “The way we dress up, the way we greet and most importantly, the evils we observe in society are reflected in our shayaris, just like it does for any other artiste.”
 
 University’s pro-VC PG Yeole, registrar  , BCUD director   and a host of other invitees were also present on the occasion.
 
 Apart from mushaira, a literary quiz competition, ghazal sarai and a competition for reading ghazals were also organized by the college students.
