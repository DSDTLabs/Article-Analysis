Mumbai: Observing that monsoon is ‘fast approaching’, the   on Monday directed the   to reply at what stage is the installation of the sewage treatment plants for the city.

 After the 2005 deluge, sewage treatment plants were recommended by the Chitale committee to separate sewage from stormwater as the city’s entire waste is directly released into rivers. The report was placed before the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and IIT-Bombay which then recommended 37 plants for the city. A bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a PIL by advocate Atal Dubey seeking corrective steps after the   brought Mumbai to a halt.
 
 Advocate S C Naidu, appearing for Dubey, argued that last September, the high court had directed that the plants be made operational as waste gets into Mithi, Oshiwara, Poisar and Dahisar rivers and blocks them. “For years, they (BMC) have been giving desilting contracts worth crores of rupees before monsoon, when sewage treatment plants can be set up at a fraction of the cost,” said Naidu. The judges then reminded the municipal corporation that monsoon is ‘fast approaching’ and enquired what steps has it taken to set up the sewage treatment plants. 
 
 Senior advocate S U Kamdar, representing BMC, replied that the civic body is appointing an agency to instal sewage treatment plants and will soon file a reply giving details. 
 
 In the order, the judges said, “We hope the recommendations by NEERI and IIT-B are complied with before the 2017 monsoon commences.”
