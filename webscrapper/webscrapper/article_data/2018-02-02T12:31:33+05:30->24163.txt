NOIDA: According to Annu Khan president   and Members Association (NEFOMA) the budget 2018 is completely a   and drawn mostly to capture votes for 2019 elections. Its a complete eyewash budget for homebuyers of district Gautam Budh Nagar. "The goverment has overlooked the pain of lakhs of homebuyers stuck in a limbo who are still awaiting possession of their homes in district Gautam Budh Nagar " said Khan.

 He further adds that while the goverment took care of its ministers and the salaried class, "it paid no heed to right of flat/homebuyers in G B Nagar who are fighting for their ecistence now. This is very unfortunate," said Khan.
 
 He further rues no benefits for the common man in this budget. "There's no relief in income tax for the common man in this budget whereas they've brought companies with turnover of 250 crores in 25 % tax bracket," said Khan.
 
 For Dr R S Rai resident Kendriya Vihar sector 82 Noida it was a highly disappointing budget for the middle class. "We were hoping some change in the tax slabs. But what we get is a cess increase in health and education is an extra burden. Further, long term capital gain tax (LTCG) will be another blow to the investor and the middle class. On one hand the interest on post office, RD, FD etc has been reduced drastically, on the other the burden of LTCG tax has now been levied on investor. Where the middle class will go?" questions Rai.
 
 Kunwar Singh resident of sector 30 maintained that the budget was targeted at rural vote banks. "Wonder how is this budget an economic push. Poor people to get health free - with no oxygen cyclinders - its like sticking out a carrot before a donkey," said Singh.
