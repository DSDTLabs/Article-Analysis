NEW DELHI: The government has rejected a request made by the   seeking powers to initiate contempt proceedings against political parties which make allegations against it without credible evidence.

 In a written response to a Parliament question on Friday, minister of state for law P P Chaudhury said that the   proposal was examined from legal and constitutional angles. The law ministry had also taken into account judicial pronouncements in this regard.
 
 “It has been opined that the conferment of power of contempt on the Election Commission may be inconsistent with the law laid down by the  ,” he said.
 
 In a letter written in April, the commission had urged the law ministry to amend the election laws so that it can use ‘Contempt of Court’ Act against such parties that makes false allegations against it.
 
 The letter came close on the heels of AAP questioning the impartiality of the EC in conduct of elections and on the authenticity of the electronic voting machines.
