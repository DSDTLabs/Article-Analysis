VARANASI: Opening a front against chief minister  , his cabinet college and   (SBSP) president Om Prakash Rajbhar exhorted his party workers to invest energy in pushing for ban on liquor in UP. 

 The SBSP will organize a district-level 'Mahila maha rally' in Ballia on May 20 and launch a statewide movement from Varanasi on May 16 to seek a complete ban on liquor in the state.
 
 Citing an example of the mythological war between Lav-Kush and their father Lord Ram, Rajbhar said: "The way Lav-Kush clashed with Lord Ram, Bharat, Laxman and Shatrughan, our fight is with the CM on this issue...   president Amit Shah will mediate for taking the decision."
