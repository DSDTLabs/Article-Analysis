Singer-songwriter   has confirmed that he is set to feature in the upcoming 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' film. The 'Take That' singer was rumoured to be portraying a stormtrooper in the next installment of the blockbuster sci-fi franchise, but he has now confirmed his cameo will not be as one of the soldiers of the   Empire. 

  
  
 "I'm not a stormtrooper, but I am in it. Now I've said that, I'll probably be out. I think the Star Wars people are so strict about what information (is out there). So me saying that, I've probably just done myself out of a role,"   says. 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is due for release in December 2017.
