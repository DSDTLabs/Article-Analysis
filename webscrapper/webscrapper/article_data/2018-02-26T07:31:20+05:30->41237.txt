Nagpur: A student of Standard X, aged 16 years, was molested on the school premises by an outsider on Friday. After the girl raised an alarm, the unidentified assailant, in his 30s, fled the scene. The incident, however, has raised a serious question over security of the students in educational institutions in the city.

 According to police, the student had gone to the school to collect her I-card (admit card) for the board examination. When the student was walking up the stairs to reach her class for collecting the I-card, an unidentified man grabbed her from behind and started groping her. Taken aback, the survivor protested and started screaming for help. The assailant panicked and started fleeing. The student tried to chase the assailant, but he managed to escape. Even the guards deployed at the school could not nab him.
 
 The girl informed her teachers about the incident who reported the matter to the police.
 
 The police have started analyzing the CCTV footage which shows that the assailant seemed to have entered the school following the teenager. The school authorities have claimed that the man in the footage was none of the employees or even technicians who work for them. The cops are now exploring the possibility of the culprit being a parent of some other student and some outsider.
 
 Senior PI   of   police station said the school principal had informed the cops about the incident before the offence had been registered. “We could not question the survivor as she had to prepare for the examination but our investigation is in progress. Police are hopeful to nab the culprit. We cannot spare such elements,” said Sankhe.
