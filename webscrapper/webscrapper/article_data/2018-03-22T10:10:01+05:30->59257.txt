HYDERABAD: Remember humming and dancing to the tunes of your favourite playlist blaring away from the ubiquitous audio cassette player that was a must have in every home?

 Well, in this era of digital technology, when people are just a click away from their favourite music playlist on their phones, iPods or even laptops and desktops, audio cassettes are today just a ticket to a trip down memory lane.
 
 But despite the internet and music apps ruling the roost these days, this musical delight of the 1970s-2000 still finds a home in   , where a few shops continue to cater to die-hard audio cassette lovers.
 
 Meet  , who boasts of a collection of more than 5,000 audio cassettes in his shop. “I have cassettes of Mughal-e-Azam, Naya Daur, Kashmir Ki Kali, Dil, Aashiqui and many others,” points out   with a touch of pride.
 
 “People, who used to troop into my shop with their desired song lists, no longer come so often . These audio cassettes today serve more as a memory of a bygone era,” says  , who used to find himself busy taking orders from customers eager to get their favourite songs transferred to their cassettes when the demand for cassettes was at its peak.
 
 “Youngsters don’t prefer going to a store anymore to buy a cassette. They would rather download the music of their choice via the internet and they don’t mind paying a small amount of money for it too. The internet and mobile phones have completely destroyed the business of audio cassettes, CDs and DVDs,” laments Ahmed, who now works as a courier agent to eke out a living.
 
 Driven by nostalgia, an elderly man,   points out, “The use of tape recorders to play songs and record them has faded away. The existing shops only transport us to the days gone by.”
