Later, Pant had directed district collector KC Meena in this regard for a technical survey. After the completion of the survey Meena recently sent a proposal to this effect to the ASI.
 
 ``Residents of the fort have been demanding for an alternative exit route to be used in case of an emergency. We have completed the technical survey and have proposed a staircase route. There will be 99 stairs each 1.5 metre wide at a gradient of six inches,‚Äù Meena said.
 
 He said the alternative route will be made at south eastern side of the fort.
