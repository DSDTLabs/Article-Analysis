ROHTAK: After introduction of Aadhaar-enabled verification of candidates appearing in the Haryana Teachers Eligibility Test (HTET) last year, not even 1% of the aspirants taking the level-3 exam for selection as postgraduate teachers (PGT) could qualify it. According to the figures provided by the Board of School Education, Haryana (BSEH) on Thursday, only 0.83% of them managed to clear the examination held on December 23, 2017.

 The pass percentage for PGT category during the previous examination in 2016 was 21.86%, while that for ( ) level-2 and primary teachers level-1was 9% and 35.37%.
 
 However, this time, the pass percentage for trained graduate teachers (TGT) level-2 category was slightly better at 9.98% while that for primary teachers level-1 remained lower at 12.51%. A total of 4,12,024 candidates had appeared in the exam conducted by the board on December 23-24, 2017, throughout the state. Out of these candidates, 1,23,419 were males and 2,88,605 females. The answer keys for the same were released on the BSEH website on January 15.
 
 The board chairperson,  , attributed the poor result to multiple factors, including mandatory Aadhaarenabled verification in the 2017 examination. He said, "It was for the first time that   cameras were installed in classrooms leaving no scope of any irregularities that used to occur earlier, like getting help from staff on duty."
 
 
 
 
 Apart fom this, strict measures by the board and deployment of police personnel in strength prevented paper leakage and contributed to the low score. In 2015, the level-3 exam had to be cancelled after five persons were arrested in a paper leak incident at Jind district. More than 1.37 lakh candidates had appeared for exam in 2015 at 450 centres across the state and outside.
 
 The BSEH said qualified candidates would be awarded a certificate by the board. Those who qualify for more than one level would be given separate certificates. Jagbir said those who had rfailed could appear again for the HTET exam on November 17-18. The result of HTET was delayed this time because of incomplete Aadhaarbased biometric attendance. The BSEH had issued a notification saying that the board would announce the result only after completing the Aadhaar-based biometric attendance of all candidates.
