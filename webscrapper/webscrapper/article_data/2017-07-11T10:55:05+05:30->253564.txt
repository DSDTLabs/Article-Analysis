NEW DELHI: In the wake of a terror attack on a bus carrying Amarnath pilgrims, the Centre on Tuesday appealed to all yatris to follow existing safety protocols and to cooperate with the administration.

 Terrorists on Monday killed seven Amarnath pilgrims, including six women, and injured 19 others as they struck at a bus in Kashmir's   district.
 
 Union minister for information and broadcasting M   said he was confident that the state government and central security forces are making all arrangements for the safety and security of the pilgrims.
 
 "The information that is available is that that the bus was not registered with the shrine board, nor was there any security with the bus. However, the administration is probing the matter and something can be said once the final report comes," Naidu said.
 
 "I hope the pilgrims will cooperate by giving advance intimation, information and also follow the protocol of security so that they are all secured," he added.
 
 Naidu condemned Monday night's dastardly strike on pilgrims in the strongest words and conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families.
 
 "I feel sad about the dastardly act of terrorists killing the   pilgrims. It is an act against humanity. It brings a bad name to the state of Kashmir and nobody can approve such heinous crimes against pilgrims. No religion accepts this. Terrorists, as we say, have no religion. I condemn the incident and condole the death of the pilgrims and convey my heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families."
 
 Meanwhile, Union home minister   chaired a high-level security to review the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of terror attack on Amarnath pilgrims.
