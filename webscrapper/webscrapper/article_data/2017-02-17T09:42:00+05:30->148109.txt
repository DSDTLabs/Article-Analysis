HYDERABAD: Responding to a summons by   officials, tennis star Sania Mirza’s representatives furnished documents on Thursday. According to sources, one of the key documents was the recent government order (GO) declaring the Rs 1 crore given to her for being ‘brand ambassador’ of Telangana as a ‘cash incentive for training’.

 CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had anointed Sania as brand ambassador on July 22, 2014 and handed over a cheque for Rs 1 crore. On Sept 11 that year, she was awarded Rs 1 crore for winning the US Open mixed doubles title. This award was declared as non-taxable. But officials said that Sania has to pay Rs 20 lakh (15% service tax, fine and penalty) for the brand ambassador money.
 
 On Thursday, Sania’s representatives furnished documents related to her income and expenditure. “One of the documents was a recent GO copy declaring the Rs 1 crore given to Sania on July 22, 2014 as ‘cash incentive for training’,” a government official said. 
 
 After the summons by service tax superintendent   on Feb 6, TOI contacted Sania’s chartered accountant Hameeduddin. He said the amount was not taxable. TOI’s queries to B  , secretary, youth advancement, tourism and culture, went unanswered.
