AHMEDABAD: In a weird request under the   ( ), a lawyer has asked for details about the   ( ) of a sitting judge at the city  .

 Annoyed at the judge’s courtroom behaviour and style of judicial functioning, an advocate practising at the city sessions court, Anand Brahmbhatt, filed an application under the information law asking the court registrar and principal sessions judge to furnish information about the judge’s IQ and whether his IQ is ‘zero’ or in the negative.
 
 Brahmbhatt’s application reads, “If the above mentioned judge has taken any competitive exam in which the IQ was judged, whether he was allowed to take any such examination, and give specific information on whether his IQ was zero or in negative.”
 
 Casting aspersions on the judicial officer’s efficiency, the applicant sought details on whether the Gujarat high court got the judge medically examined to know his “mental status” and sought details on whether the judge was diagnosed with mental illness at such an examination.
 
 The application, which was accepted by the city civil court’s correspondence department on Monday, raised many questions about the judicial officer’s academic career. 
 
 The applicant asked which years the judge had cleared his board exams in, graduated and obtained his law degree. The lawyer also requested information about trials undertaken and years spent by the judge in clearing these exams.
 
 The applicant lawyer also asked if there is a complaint pending against the judge before the high court and for information about it. Other details sought were about the judge’s verdicts, his assets etc.
 
 In his application, the lawyer says he is seeking the information as a common citizen and if the authorities are reluctant to part with the details, they should deny the request by citing rules/sections of the law, and not just casually deny the information.
