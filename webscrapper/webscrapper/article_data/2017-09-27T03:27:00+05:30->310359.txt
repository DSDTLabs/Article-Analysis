Margao: A drinking binge resulted in the murder of 42-year old Abdul Kader, a resident of Ravanfond, Margao, Tuesday afternoon. The assailant, Faiyaz Khatib, 36, a resident of Aquem Baixo, shot Kader point blank using a country-made firearm, police sources said, and fled. Police are on his lookout. The incident occurred at around 3.15pm, police sources said. Both Kader and Khatib are natives of Karnataka. Kader was working as a stone dresser at construction sites, while Khatib was a two-wheeler mechanic.  Explaining the circumstances that led to the murder, Margao town PI Chetan Patil told reporters that Kader and Khatib were drinking in a village pub. A casual discussion between the two, possibly friends or acquaintances, veered towards some passionate topic. Khatib then flashed his firearm which he had concealed in his trouser pocket, and pointing at Kader, threatened to kill him. “Even as Khatib was trying to threaten Kader, a bullet was fired at Kader, killing him instantly,” Patil said.  As Khatib was trying to flee the scene, the bar owner tried to restrain him, but he freed himself saying that he was going to the police station to surrender. He fled on a two-wheeler bearing registration number GA-08AK-0049. Police said that only after questioning Khatib would they be able to ascertain whether there was previous enmity between the two.  Margao town police have booked an offence against Khatib on charges of murder. The accused remained untraceable till late Tuesday night.
