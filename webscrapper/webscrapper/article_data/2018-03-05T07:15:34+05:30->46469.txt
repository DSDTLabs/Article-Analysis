AHMEDABAD: City-based endocrinologist Dr Tiven Marwah released two books on   — one on the disease and how to manage it and another on natural and   — on Sunday at   (AMA). The books were launched by governor O P Kohli and MoS (home)  .

  
  Marwah said that Gujarat is among the top states in India when it comes to diabetic patients. “Two factors — lack of exercise and increasing stress in our lifestyle — are primarily responsible for the phenomenon. Due to very high prevalence of diabetes in the state, it is my attempt to educate the masses this is important along with medical treatment to lead a healthy life,” he said.
 
 He added that there are a number of misconceptions about diabetes. One among them is that it happens due to eating excessive sugar, the diabetics can’t eat any sweet and so on. “Normally, one has to lead a balanced life and it’s the same for diabetes. We have covered multiple examples from all walks of life where the diabetic patients have achieved great heights. Scientific information has to be taken to the masses in simpler form so as not to create scare,” said Marwah.
 
 Kohli in his speech said that diseases such as diabetes have become part of the modern lifestyle and thus awareness about it should be spread. He also asked the state government to include a few points about such diseases and how to prevent it in school syllabuses.
