NEW DELHI: The BCCI were in for some more embarrassment after match referee   rated the   for the second Test between India and Australia as "below average" after the Pune pitch was rated as "poor".

 India won the second Test in Bengaluru by 75 runs after losing the first Test by 333 runs. The third Test will begin Ranchi from Thursday.
 
 According to a report in ESPN Cricinfo, Broad rated the pitch "below average" while outfield was termed "very good".
 
 According to the report in the website, Broad's inference was drawn from the fact that pitch had "variable bounce".
 
 The "below average" rating may cause a bit of embarrassment for BCCI but does not carry any "penalty or fine". It is considered to be a better rating than "poor" or "unfit for play" which can bring in hefty sanction by the game's governing body.
 
 The Bangalore wicket saw   get 8 off 50 on the first day of the Test match while   and   got six wickets apiece in first and second inning respectively. Ashwin was unplayable on the fourth day.
 
 Pune was the second Indian pitch to be rated poor in two seasons, after India beat South Africa in Nagpur in three days in 2015-16. Since the   began its pitch and outfield monitoring process in 2006, four of the seven full-member pitches rated poor or unfit have belonged to India.
 
 There are talks that even the Ranchi pitch may not last the distance.
