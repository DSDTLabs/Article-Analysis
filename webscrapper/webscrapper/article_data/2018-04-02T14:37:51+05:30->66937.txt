GUNTUR: The grand plans of the state government to provide ‘health for all’ by bringing above poverty line ( ) families under a comprehensive health insurance,   have come a cropper apparently due to the high premium fixed for the policy. The scheme could not attract even 2% of the target group of population in the state even a year after the launch of the scheme. 

 According to latest information, only around 39,000 families consisting of 85,000 members have purchased the Arogya Rakha insurance scheme launched in the last April. In fact, the state government wanted to cover nearly 32 lakh families under the scheme. The government had fixed the annual premium per person at Rs 1,200 which makes a family to cough up nearly Rs 5,000 per year. “Many private health insurance policies are available in the market for a premium between Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per annum which takes care of health needs of four of a family. The government should have offered similar scheme at subsidised amount to attract more,” observed social activist SVS Lakshminarayana.
 
 Interestingly, nearly 1.2 crore NTR   (Arogya Sri) cards are in circulation in the state which means that entire 5 crore population in the state falls under   category. 
 
 The officials are worried that the enrolment under Arogya Raksha could further go down during 2018-19, which they apprehend, could lead to people resorting to malpractices to get the free health insurance card under NTR Vaidya Seva (Arogya Sri).
