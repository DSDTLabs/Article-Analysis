CHENNAI: A PIL has been filed in Madras high court to direct Tamil Nadu government to release 7tmc of water from   dam, to facilitate irrigation of over 1 lakh acres of agricultural lands served by Lower Bhavani Project Channel. 

 Admitting the plea, the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   directed the government pleader to get instructions from the authorities concerned. It then adjourned the case to April 23 for further hearing.
 
 According to the petitioner, at present about 1.03 lakh acres of lands covered under odd turn sluices were deprived of water for the past two years due to failure of monsoon and shortage of water in the Bhavanisagar dam.
 
 "For the past two months Lower Bhavani Farmers' Federation has been consistently raising the demand to release water from the dam. On December 29, 2017 the federation made a representation to the authorities to release 4tmc of water. As no action was taken, one again on January 30, another representation was given to the district collector. As the collector too failed to respond they have approached the court," the petitioner's counsel said.
