BENGALURU: The launch of the BJP’s Parivarthana Yatra in Bengaluru in November last year set a dubious benchmark of sorts for its failure to attract a sizeable crowd. Now, political parties are going all out to ‘fix’ the issue of getting people to their rallies.

 Trying to learn from the ‘mistakes’ of the   and BJP, the two national parties, the ambitious plan of the JD(S)
 
 
 to draw 10 lakh people at a single venue for its rally in Bengaluru on February 17 is based on ‘optics’. JD(S) leaders said the party has gone to the extent of visiting Palace Grounds soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally on February 4, to study seating arrangements at the venue.
 
 The BJP claimed nearly three lakh people turned out for the PM’s event. JD(S) sources said to accommodate such a large number, chairs would have to be placed at 4.5 sqft. Event management companies generally place it at 8 sqft for spacious seating. It is claimed that the BJP went diagonal and placed chairs at 10 sqft apart instead of trying to place chairs either in vertical or horizontal rows.
 
 “When we studied the plans, we found that the BJP had placed not more than 35,000 chairs,” said JD(S) rally venue co-ordinator Madhu  . “It was the optics that made it look as if three lakh people had attended the   rally at Palace Grounds.”
 
 According to the party, the JD(S) will now use the full 140 acres of land — which has been lent free of cost to the party — to host their rally. The land is owned by a group of four or five people, all of whom are supporters of JD(S) supremo H D   and state president  .
 
 “We will make seating arrangements for five to six lakh people,” said Bangarappa. Presently, 22 JCBs are levelling the land.
 
 Unlike the two national parties, which forced thousands of their party workers and supporters to brave the blistering heat, the JD(S) has scheduled its rally at 4pm. This will also give people ample time to have lunch.
