NEW DELHI: On lines of packaged food products, cosmetics and toiletries like face wash, soaps, shampoos and toothpastes will soon carry a brown/red or green dot indicating the source of the product as vegetarian or non-vegetarian. 

 A proposal in this regard was recently cleared by India's highest drug advisory body,   (DTAB), said a senior official in the   (CDSCO).
 
  "The Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) cleared the proposal regarding mandatory labelling of cosmetic products and toiletries with a brown/red and green dot on Wednesday.To incorporate the changes, the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, will have to be amended," the official said. 
 
  A notification in this regard is expected to be issued in another six months. Packaged food items sold in India are required to be labelled with a mark indicating whether source of the product was vegetarian or non-vegetarian. pti
