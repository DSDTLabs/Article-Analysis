PUNE: A fungus-infested veg puff, bought from a from one of the food outlets at the airport terminal building, has put the focus back on the quality of food available at the airport.

  resident   was on his way to New Delhi on April 25, when he decided to get a quick bite. “It was around 11pm. I went to an outlet and got a veg puff for Rs 70. However, when I took the puff out, I could immediately spot the fungus. I went back to complain about it. One of the men at the outlet just took the puff and threw it in the dustbin. He reacted as if nothing had happened. When asked why were they serving inedible food, they said the fungus may have developed as it was very hot inside the airport. But the entire airport is air-conditioned. My only regret is that I forgot to take the bill,” Rai said. He further alleged the outlet had no mechanism for a customer to file complaints. “When I wanted to file a complaint, they gave me a personal diary to write the complaint in,” he said.
 
 Rai wrote about his experience and tagged the   on Twitter. He even sent an email to the airport director, attaching a photograph of the outlet and seeking strict action against it. However, he is yet to hear from any official. A Twitter message sent against the complaint filed by Rai said: “We have noted your feedback.” Sources, however, said the airport authorities were investigating the matter.
