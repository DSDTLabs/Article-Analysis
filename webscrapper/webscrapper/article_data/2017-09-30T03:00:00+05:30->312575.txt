Known for portraying glam roles as well as characters of substance,   has gone the extra-mile to get into her character in the upcoming 'Hampi. 

 The actress is playing a geeky tomboy in the   directorial, and her first look itself is sure to create a buzz among fans. However, Sonalee has not cropped her tresses, but sports a   instead. Quite excited about her new look, Sonalee informs, “Prakash was keen on giving a different look to my character. In fact, he wanted me to actually crop my hair short! But I was a little hesitant because I have never had such short hair, and was not sure whether it would suit me. Also, I was simultaneously working on other projects, so cutting my hair short would’ve affected those as well.” Sporting such a look has its advantages too. “It would take five minutes to get into the entire get-up. I would get ready even before the male leads,” quips Sonalee. She adds, “My character Isha is a nerd and is going through a difficult time in her life. I’m sure the audience will relate to Isha and forget Sonalee when they watch the film.”
