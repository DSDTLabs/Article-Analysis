NAVI MUMBAI : The proposed concretization work of the four-lane   road along the foothills of Parsik range will take another year to complete after a delay of almost two years. The makeover plan of the remaining 5.4km asphalt stretch between   and Mukand junction is aimed at decongesting   ( see box). 

 Pegged at Rs 48 crore under the second phase of the MIDC road concretization, the uneven stretch is now riddled with potholes forcing commuters to endure back-breaking rides. 
 
 The delay has been attributed to lack of interest from the contractors which led to retendering, apart from tackling issues such as removal of electric poles, high tension towers and sundry encroachments, including illegal shops and slums along the existing two-lane asphalt road.
 
  NMMC has completed the survey and shortlisted the encroachments. It will soon serve eviction notices to as many as 122 encroachers, who are in the way of unfinished portion of 5.4 km stretch. 
 
 The delay in executing the makeover plan to provide seamless travel between Thane and Navi Mumbai and decongest the busy T-B road are affecting the harried commuters too.
 
 “We hope NMMC completes the work at the earliest to provide us with an alternative connectivity to T-B Road,” said a motorist.
 
  NMMC executive engineer   said, “The drainage line work has already kicked off to ensure that the task resumes after the monsoon. We will complete the work by July 2018. Eviction notices will be slapped on the encroachers for which the final survey has been completed. Also, some of the electric poles will be relocated to clear the area.” 
 
 The first phase of work on 4.9 km concretized patch between Mahape and Rabale was thrown open to the motorists a year ago. The remaining section of the road in the current phase II work is in shoddy condition and motorists prefer to use the Thane-Belapur Road despite snarls.
