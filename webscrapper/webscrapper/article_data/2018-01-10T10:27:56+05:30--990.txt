INDORE: A 63-year-old man, who set himself ablaze in MP after India skipper   got out scoring just 28 during the first Test match between India and  , died at a   hospital on Tuesday.

 Babulal Bairva, who retired from the railways, was watching the match on TV at his home on January 5. India were chasing 208 in the hope of a historic win.
 
 A die-hard fan, Bairva was furious when India lost three wickets with just 39 on the board. And when   got out for 28 runs, with the score at 71, Bairva was both infuriated and heartbroken, said police. 
 
 He poured kerosene and set himself on fire, Station Road police station in-charge Ajay Sarvan told TOI. Bairva suffered grievous burns on his torso and face and was admitted to the district hospital. “He told the investigating officer that he got frustrated after Kohli got out and decided to burn himself,” Sarvan said.
