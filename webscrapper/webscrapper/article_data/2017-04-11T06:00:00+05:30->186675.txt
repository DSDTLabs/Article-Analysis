Visakhapatnam: The union government’s computerised Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) has helped the AP government save nearly Rs 991.90 crore worth of   including Rs 957.65 worth of rice, Rs 22.60 crore worth of sugar and Rs 11.65 crore worth of wheat set aside for distribution through fair price shops.

 The state government used to depend on the enforcement agencies to prevent distribution of the commodities to fake beneficiaries. The agencies regularly carried out raids in ration shops and arrested corrupt officials who indulged in fraudulent practices. However, with the introduction of a computerised system, the government is able to keep track of the beneficiaries.
 
 A report prepared by the civil supplies department stated that the government can save 3,36,265 metric tonne of essential commodities including 3,14,522 metric tonne of rice, 14,224 metric tonne of sugar and 7,518 metric tonne of wheat from misuse by fair price shops with help of the TPDS scheme.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam district's civil supplies officer for rural section Ch Ananda Kumar said the TPDS scheme has played a pivotal role in overcoming various challenges in the public distribution system. “The challenges include leakages, diversion of food grains, fake and bogus ration cards, inclusion and exclusion errors, lack of transparency, weak grievance redressal and social audit mechanisms,” he added.
 
 Quoting a socio economic survey report of 2016-17, a senior civil supplies official said out of 29,054 fair price shops in the state, 28,445 were using PoS devices-cum-electronic weighing machines. As many as 28,422 iris readers were used for authentication whenever biometric verification failed. 
 
 "Post automation of fair price shops, Rs 991.90 crore worth of essencial commodities have been saved since from April 2015 to December 2016," the officer said.
