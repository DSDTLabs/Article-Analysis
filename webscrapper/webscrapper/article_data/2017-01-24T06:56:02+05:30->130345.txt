CHENNAI: As the   took a violent turn on Monday, schools shut down half way through the day as panic spread through the city. 

 Anxious parents called schools as news of vandalism and unrest circulated in the city, some insisting on taking their wards home even before the schools had decided to close.
 
 On Monday, several schools like Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan-KK Nagar, Chettinad Vidyashram, Sishya, DAV and the Kendriya Vidyalayas sent out messages to parents asking them to pick up their children. 
 
 "I couldn't contact my son in school as he has no mobile phone and it was a while before he reached home so we were very worried," said Mani, a parent. 
 
 At some schools, parents congregated at gates demanding they be allowed to take their wards home.
 
 Parents of children in Ponn Vidyashram, Velachery, said with roads leading to the school blocked by protestors they had no choice but to park their vehicles near the railway station and walk up to the school pick up their wards.
 
 A student of Chettinad Vidyashram said they were asked to wait in class for a while after which they were given the option to sit in their respective school vans. 
 
 "We had quite a long wait as the van drivers had to go and individually pick up students from different classes and bring them to the vans," he said.
 
 A few schools such as the Shree Niketan Group of Schools did not shut the school until the protests mellowed as authorities felt the students were safer inside the campus. 
 
 "We were worried about sending the children back in the buses in such a situation. So we decided to wait a while, and then assigned three teachers to every bus to accompany the children," said correspondent of the school P Vishnucharan.
 
 Stray incidents of school buses being damaged were reported in the city. However, no students were in the bus at the time.Several colleges in the city reported minimal attendance on Monday as students continued their protests on campuses as well as outside.
