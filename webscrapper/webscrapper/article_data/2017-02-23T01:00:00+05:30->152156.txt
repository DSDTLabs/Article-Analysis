 Bhatt, few would know, admires cricket legend   but doesn’t quite boast about it. Recently, the actress missed a chance to meet him although he was just a few metres away from her. Alia was caught up with the promotional activities for her upcoming film, ' ', with co-star   at a suburban film studio. 

  
  
 
 Sachin was shooting an ad at an adjacent floor. Alia was shy to send a message across to his staff through hers that she wanted to meet him briefly and probably take a picture. “It was time for Sachin to leave when Varun, who had already met him the same afternoon, tried to fix a meeting for her with Sachin but Alia was too shy to relent. Eventually, Sachin left and she couldn’t meet him,” says a source present on the set.
