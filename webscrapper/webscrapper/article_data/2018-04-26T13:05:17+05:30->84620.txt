SURAT:  ,  , allegedly by Asaramâ€™s rape accused son  , to bribe all authorities from police to doctors and even judicial officers by splurging Rs 13 crore. This was to help Sai in the rape case against him and replace the property document bundles with other papers. 

 Police had recovered Rs 9 crore bribe money and property papers from a car and arrested 11 persons in the case. One accused   is yet to get arrested. Chargesheet in the case was filed in February 2014 and currently the case and witnesses are being examined in the court. Sai is the prime accused in the case.
 
 The plot was exposed after C M  , a police sub-inspector with Surat detection of crime branch (DCB), was nabbed red-handed accepting bribe of Rs 1 crore from one of the accused. Later, police recovered Rs 8 crore from other accused persons, which they had arranged to make bribe to various government officers related with the probe.
 
 The bribe was initially offered by Sai during interrogation, sources in the police informed.
