INDORE: The newly set up Central Placement Cell at   is focusing on finding suitable employment to the students of various vocational and traditional courses.

 Previously only a few prominent departments from the varsity like Institute of Management Studies (IMS),   (IIPS), Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) and   (EMRC) were known for good placement for graduates and post graduates. 
 
 However, under this central placement cell, a three-member team has been formed that is now working towards bringing employment opportunities for the other departments of the university that lacked behind. 
 
 “We are working towards bringing all the teaching departments of the varsity under one umbrella. We are targeting all departments for campus placements now rather than focusing on individual department,” said Awnish Vyas, a member of the central placement cell and training and placement officer at IMS. 
 
 “We are inviting companies for various departments and also guiding the students about various career options,” added Vyas. 
 
 The team of Govind Maheswari, Nishikant Waikar and Awnish Vyas will also be guiding the students of summer training and job orientation. 
 
 Officials said the companies that have been visiting the prominent departments of the varsity for placement drives also will be roped in for placements at other departments also. 
 
 Vice-chancellor Prof NK Dhakad earlier this year stressed on multiplying campus placements for students and planning to rope in sector wise industries for hand-on experience and industrial training for all the teaching departments of the varsity. 
 
 “The campus placements earlier at some departments has been disappointing and shows that we need to improve our students and teachers to make them perfect for campus placements so that all the students studying in the university get placed,” said Dhakad.
