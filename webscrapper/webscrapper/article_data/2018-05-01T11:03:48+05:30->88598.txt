MUMBAI: The Indian national football team always had a myriad of footballers from Mumbai, but over the past decade or so, that number seems to have dwindled.

 
 
 Presently, the metro city doesn't even have a team in the I-League, though they have a team in the   ( ).
 
 Former India skipper and captain of the team that won the   in 1974,  , told TOI that having more tournaments, especially age group specific, is the only way forward.
 
 Ali was in the city as a special guest for the 2nd   ( ) awards.
 
 “The more tournaments you have, the more exposure youngsters get. That’s very important for the development of any youngster. Just having a league is alright, but tournaments motivate you to perform better,” he said.
 
 The ace striker was amazed with the flamboyance with which the MDFA awards were conducted. The organisers had called the top three teams from every division, right from U-12 to the Elite Division, for the awards.
 
 “I’ve been all over the country but I've never seen such a grand awards night. What more motivation do the kids need,” he said.
 
 Ali, who currently coaches in Hyderabad, also praised the ISL for raising the profile of Indian players but warned that the I-League teams can't be taken lightly.
 
 “Players like Balwant Singh, Sandesh Jhinghan and Mandar Rao Desai have become household names because of the ISL. It’s great for football, but the I-League too has a lot of history. Just look at the Kolkata clubs (Mohun Bagan and East Bengal). You saw how well the I-League clubs performed in the Super Cup. With so much competition at the national level, it’s only a matter of time when our national team will be able to compete against strong Asian countries,” he said.
