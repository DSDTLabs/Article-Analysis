Calangute: The Candolim gram sabha on Sunday ended in chaos after the panchayat secretary and sarpanch refused to entertain a demand from villagers to adopt a resolution opposing the outline development plan (ODP) for Candolim, with a majority of villagers staging a walk-out. Sarpanch Blaize Fernandes said that around two years ago a gram sabha of the Candolim panchayat had already adopted a resolution favouring the ODP. He suggested that a special gram sabha be held to deliberate the issue so as to give a chance to those in favour of the ODP to also be present. Unhappy with this response, a majority of the villagers staged a walk-out, bringing the gram sabha to an end. tnn
