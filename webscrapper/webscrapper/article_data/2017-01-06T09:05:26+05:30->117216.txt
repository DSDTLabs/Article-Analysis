MADURAI: Madurai city police   in connection with the murder of her husband in connivance with her paramour. The victim, who had gone missing in November, was found to have been murdered. The   was exhumed on Wednesday.

  Although the murder took place a couple of months ago, it came to light only after the paramour along with his nephew, an 18-year-old college student, who recently surrendered in connection with the murder, were taken under police custody on January 3rd and grilled. 
 
 The woman has been identified as Senthil Arasi alias Suganya, 23, wife of Muthu, a 32-year-old driver from Sellur in Madurai city. Police said Senthil Arasi had married Muthu when she was just 16 years old. She became distant from Muthu as he often quarrelled with her. She began an affair with her husband's friend Selvakumar, a married man from the city.
 
 When Muthu learned about the affair, he became enraged. Thus Senthil Arasi and Selvakumar plotted his murder. On November 11, Selvakumar took Muthu to   at Melakkal to amicably solve issues between them. Selvakumar and his nephew strangled him to death and later buried him.
 
 Ever since the murder, Senthil Arasi maintained that he husband left home one day and never came back. However, a police complaint had not been registered until Muthu's mother Pappammal who came from Virudhunagar, 10 days after the murder, inquired about him. She preferred a police complaint.
 
 While   was under way, the duo surrendered in court, as police zeroed in on Senthil Arasi, questioning the frequent calls between her and Selvakumar with the help of call records. Two more involved in the murder are still at large.
