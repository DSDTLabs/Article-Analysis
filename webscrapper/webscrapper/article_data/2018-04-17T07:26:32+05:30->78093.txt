KOLKATA: After several incidents of ragging,   has decided to allocate a separate hostel to boys in the first year of post-graduation from the current academic session. The New Law Hostel has been chosen to start the initiative, which, authorities felt, will reduce complaints of ragging and harassment that have hurt the university’s reputation in the past few years. If the initiative is successful, it will be implemented for the girls as well. The highest administrative decision-making body of the varsity has also resolved on Monday to appoint full time staff to the posts of superintendents in all the 16 hostels.

 Additionally, non-boarders have been barred from staying overnight and alcohol has been restricted.
 
 Vice-chancellor   said, “The New Law Hostel has been identified since it is nearest to the College Street main campus.”
 
 The full-time, residential superintendents must be between the ages of 45 and 55 and have either a UG or a PG degree. Their salary has been fixed at Rs 10,000.
 
 Questions were, however, being raised over the delay in taking the decision since both   and AICTE had directed all institutes to separate first-year students from others.
 
 “The decision will help stop ragging. But it will also affect integration of students among themselves. In any institution, it is preferable that the students should mix freely. This decision will result in an insulated community,” said educationist  .
 
 The move will also allow stricter monitoring of the first-year students, an official said.
 
 At the moment there are three hostels for UG students, out of which two are for girls. The remaining 13 are for PG candidates. “The New Law Hostel will not be enough to accommodate all the first-year PG boys seeking the facility. But since this decision has been made into a policy by the VC,we will have to find another hostel,” said an official.
