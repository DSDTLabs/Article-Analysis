KOCHI: As medical college authorities are unable to provide adequate supply of medicines, patients and bystanders are having a tough time. Many medicines are not available at the   at the medical college for quite some time.

 According to medical college authorities, the shortage of medicine supply is a routine issue which arises during the end of every financial year.“ However, we have bought some of the medicines last week.

We will be procuring more drugs using funds from the schemes like   (RSBY) in the coming days,“ said Dr  , medical superintendent, Government Medical College, Ernakulam.
 
 Though the medical college owns many ambulances, the patients have to run around for ambulances during emergencies. Last week, a patient admitted in the medical college had to be shifted a hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. Even after waiting for more than an hour for the ambulance at the medical college in vain, the bystanders had to approach Kalamassery municipality for purpose.
 
 “Some of the relatives of the patient had approached us. But, our ambulance was not available at that time. Then I called up the medical college authorities who,then, promised me to make ambulance available for the patient,“ she said.
 
 At the same time, medical college authorities said that there only three ambulances which are on service now. “Still, we manage to provide the services to the patients,“ Dr Anil Kumar said. But, some of the officials say that there more ambulances.
 
 “Two of them remain abandoned in the medical college campus itself. Another one provided by P Rajeeve during his stint as MP is rarely used. Two ambulances are in the workshop.Now, only one ambulance is on service,“ the official said.
