The film, which has   and  , revolves around a group of kids who are into martial arts. “Usually, Yogi B is associated with rap, but this song, written by Pa Vijay and titled  , will be different, and bring forth a unique dimension in him as a singer. When we approached him, he liked the tune a lot and came to Chennai from Malaysia to record it, a few days ago,” says Ganesh, an engineer-turned-composer. “Yogi B has recently recorded with composers like Anirudh and Santhosh Narayanan for films like Vivegam and Kaala, so I’m fortunate to have him sing in my debut film,” he gushes. 

 “For me, music has been a passion since childhood, though no one from my family is into music or films. I’m a self-taught musician. I did an album, U — The Epitome Of Love, five to six years ago, and it was warmly received at a time when social media wasn’t as huge as it is today. And that brought the notice of the film industry,” reveals the youngster. He is now also composing for RK Suresh’s Vettai Naai, and Thiripuram, that stars Mayilsamy’s son, Anbu. Interestingly, the latter film was supposed to have been his debut, but now, he says that Ezhumin might end up as his first film. Ganesh has also got a big star to sing one of the songs in this album, but adds that he cannot reveal his name now.
