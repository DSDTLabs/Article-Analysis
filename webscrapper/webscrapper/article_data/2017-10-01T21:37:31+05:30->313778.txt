LUCKNOW: An   call to UP Police   control room about a bomb being planted in UP state assembly sent the police into a tizzy on Sunday. However, the threat that led to police scanning entire assembly premises turned out to be a hoax. 

  According to police, at around 1.30pm, ‘Dial 100’ received a call stating that there is a high-intensity bomb on the premises of the assembly. When police called back the number was found to be switched off. However, taking no chances, a dog squad and bomb disposal squad were rushed to the assembly. 
 
  Circle officer, Hazratganj police, Abhay Mishra said "The premises was checked for over an hour but nothing suspicious was recovered." Mishra also said that an FIR under `criminal intimidation by anonymous communication' has been registered against an unidentified person. Efforts are on to trace the number.
 
  On July 12, there was a similar scare after a white powder suspected to be an explosive was recovered from the assembly. Later, however, it was revealed that the powder was Silicon Di-Oxide, which is not an explosive.
