KOLKATA: The city police plans to question leather technologist Subhabrata Majumdar’s father —   (89) — and carry out further searches at their   residence. The probe has hit a wall after   suddenly developed high feer alongside other complications and got admitted at the SSKM Hospital. Though his condition has improved, cops said they will wait for doctors and relatives to confirm that is in a position to answer tough questions.

 In the meantime, a Behala police team has decided to approach the medical board treating Subhabrata in order to question him. “We are going to put the application in the next couple of days. We will explain the immediacy of our application to the   authorities in the same letter,” said an investigating officer. Subhabrata’s initial questioning has left several gaps. Now, that have fresh evidence from the bank, which has filed a FIR against him, cops want to revisit these grey areas.
 
 “We have been monitoring hos progress ever since he was admitted in Pavlov. Now that almost three weeks have gone by since the incident broke out, we are expecting an initial report from Pavlov on Subhabrata’s condition,” explained an officer.
 
 Police sources said their sole questioning will not be restricted only to the alleged bank fraud that TOI was the first to break, but also on how Subhabrata managed to procure some costly items like the industrial refrigerators, which was used by this 46-year-old to freeze his mother’s body for three years. “A thorough search of the house is also required to establish if the family has an operational bank locker. We are trying to retrace how the entire operation was organized,” claimed the officer. Lalbazar said they are also sending a new notice to the bank manager so that he can be questioned.
 
 The Behala police also confirmed they have finally received the bank’s response to the three notices they had served the bank ever since the incident came to the limelight.
