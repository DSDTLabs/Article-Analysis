CALANGUTE: Nine months on, work on the long-delayed new bridge at  , Arpora, next to Mackie’s Saturday Night Market, has been progressing at a snail’s pace. The project, which begun on June 11 last year, was expected to end within three months. Although the bridge was due to be ready by mid-September, in time for the peak tourist season, work could not be taken up due to the heavy rains. The deadline was subsequently pushed to November-end.

 Now, with the continuing slow pace of construction and the election code of conduct in force, when the bridge will be ready is anybody’s guess. Commuters, meanwhile, have been subjected to the gruelling routine of using the narrow, winding diversion via the Sankwadi-Kudos bridge, a route that has been marked with traffic snarls, particularly during the Christmas-New Year period last year and long, festive weekends. 
 
 The foundation stone for the construction of the new bridge at Tambudki was laid by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar on June 18, 2014. It is being built by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation at a cost of Rs 4.75 crore. The single span bridge over the Baga creek will be 22 metres long and 12 metres wide with a footpath and two lanes for traffic. “Work on the bridge is in the final stages and should be completed soon,” Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, said.
