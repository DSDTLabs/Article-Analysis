Acts as new-age nanny, entertaining bored kids with jokes, encouraging them to be polite

 If you thought Jeff Bezos’s ambition of delivering packages via drones was ambitious, now he’s really outdone himself.   is promising to entertain bored children with a device that spits out knock-knock jokes on demand. It’ll teach them good manners, too.
 
 The world’s biggest   will release new kid-focused skills for its   digital assistant on May 9, along with an $80 (Rs 5,300) Echo Dot voice-controlled speaker designed for children.
 
 The gadget comes with “Free-Time on Alexa,” which lets parents turn off voice purchasing, filter songs with bad words that their children might stream and set time limits to stop kids chatting to Alexa late into the night.
 
 Restless children need not bother their parents. They can say, “Alexa, I’m bored,” to get an age-appropriate suggestion, or ask for a song or knock-knock joke. A new “Magic Word” feature encourages kids to say “please” when asking Alexa questions. When questions are asked with these polite cues, Alexa will then respond using phrases such as: “Thanks for asking nicely.”
 
 Furthermore, Alexa will say “No worries” or “You’re welcome” when thanked for answering a question.
 
 The feature has been announced following concerns of some parents that use of the product was encouraging children to express themselves rudely.
 
 In January, research agency   published a report that implied that use of voice-recognition gadgets was teaching children to become more demanding. Now, Alexa might just make parents obsolete. The update comes as the company is expanding its efforts to create child-friendly technology with parental controls as part of their smart home push.
