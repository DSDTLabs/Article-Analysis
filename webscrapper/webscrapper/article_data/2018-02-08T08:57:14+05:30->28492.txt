HYDERABAD: It seems some TRS MLAs will not be given tickets to contest the 2019 elections and some will be asked to contest from constituencies other than what they represent now. Though chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had said time and again that all sitting MLAs would be fielded again, this may not happen.

 There are indications that KCR’s daughter and Nizamabad MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha may be fielded from   constituency. This could also be a party strategy to unsettle Congress strongman and sitting MLA T Jeevan Reddy, who had been elected six times from Jagtial since 1983.
 
 There is also a talk in TRS circles that IT minister   may change his constituency. Speculation is rife that he would contest from Serilingampally constituency.
 
 KTR, however, brushed aside this rumour. “Why would I want to do that? We have enough leaders in Hyderabad and its outskirts. We have showed how strong TRS is when we won the GHMC elections two years ago,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, it is learnt that some TRS MLAs are volunteering to back out of the 2019 polls. But, this comes with a rider. They are asking the party leadership to field their sons or daughters instead. Among them are some ministers also.
 
 Home minister   did not contest the 2014 elections from his   constituency. BJP’s K Laxman won from there. Nayani, however, got an MLC seat and is a minister. In 2019 polls, he is learnt to be pushing for a TRS ticket for his son-in-law.
