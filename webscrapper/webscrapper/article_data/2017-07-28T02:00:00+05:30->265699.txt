PATNA: A day after Lalu Prasad alleged CM   is a named murder accused, the ruling JD(U) on Thursday clarified Nitish was neither chargesheeted nor convicted unlike the RJD president who has been pronounced guilty by a CBI court in a fodder scam case.

 “Nitish is one of five accused in the murder case, which is sub-judice. Police investigation has found the accusation against Nitish and one more accused untrue and there is no adverse remark against the CM at any level of judiciary,” former minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh told reporters.
 
 Giving details, Singh said the murder took place at Railly village under the Pandarak police station area in Barh on November 16, 1991. The FIR was lodged the next day.
 
 “Police on January 31, 1993 filed chargesheet only against Dilip Singh, Yogendra Yadav and Boudhu Yadav. On August 5, 2008, the court of additional CJM at Barh took cognizance against the chargesheeted accused. One of them, Yogendra Yadav, moved the Patna high court (HC) which on April 22, 2009 stayed proceedings in the case at the Barh court,” Singh said.
 
 Earlier on January 20, 2009, one Ashok Kumar Singh, who was neither an informant nor a witness, filed a protest petition against the police’s clean chit to Nitish. The Barh court on August 20 the same year took cognizance of the petition and issued summons to Nitish in violation of the HC’s stay, Lallan said.
 
 Nitish challenged the Barh court’s summons in the high court which on September 8, 2009 stayed afresh further proceedings in the case.
 
 In another order on October 28, 2009, Justice Ajay Kumar Tripathi of HC issued a show-cause notice to Barh judge Ranjan Kumar Singh, asking him “under what circumstances he violated the stay order passed by this court earlier”.
