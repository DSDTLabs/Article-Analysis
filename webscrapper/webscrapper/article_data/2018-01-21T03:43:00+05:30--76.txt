Mapusa: In a profitable fallout of the ongoing indefinite tourist taxi operators strike, rent-a-cab operator, foreigners illegally operating taxis, private cars and motorcycles are raking in profits by pitching in their services to ferry stranded tourist. In hotels in North Goa, even waiters, watchmen, cooks, roomboys are taking a cut of the profit pie. Tourists desperate to make it in time to the airport or railway station are turning to local allies to organise private vehicles to transport them. Sources said that hotel staff, in the name of rent-a-cab services, taking advantage of the chaos, are instead getting private vehicles for tourists.  Rent-a-cab services are available for about Rs 1,700-2500 for 8 hours or 80km with Rs 18-22 being charged for every extra kilometre or Rs 150-250 per extra hour, depending upon the car. The booking services are also available online on the various websites.  Russians who illegally operate taxi services, usually work under the risk of being caught by police or tourist taxi operators, are openly doing business.
