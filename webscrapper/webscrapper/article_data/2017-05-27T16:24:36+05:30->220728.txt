Meerut: Around 150 families in Bhoorpur village had been having trouble due to filthy drinking water here. On Friday, the residents breathed a sigh of relief after Meerut-based social worker Jitendra Kumar Gupta gifted them two reverse osmosis (RO) mini water filtration plants, each with a capacity of 500 litres per hour. “In 2015, I had worked on getting toilets constructed in every household in the village. I was now looking for a new way to help the villagers. When I got to know about the drinking water problem here because of the village’s proximity to Kali Nadi, I decided to get RO water purifiers for the residents,” said Jitendra Kumar Gupta, who works with NGO Lala Sharda Prasad Shakuntala Devi Memorial Foundation.  “It is a matter of pride for us that such a good step towards Swachh Bharat is being taken on the day when Modi government has completed three years in office,” Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal, who inaugurated the RO plants, said. The purifiers will be able to supply around 12,000 litres of clean drinking water daily.
