Nagpur: State Election Commission (SEC) has rapped the principal secretary (general administration department) for not transferring Nagpur district collector Sachin Kurve in view of the municipal elections in the district. Municipal council elections were held in the district on January 8. 

 Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections are slated to be held on February 21. Collector Kurve hails from the city and hence as per the letter of chief secretary issued on January 19, 2016, he should have been transferred. While he is not the returning officer for NMC elections, he was in-charge of municipal council elections.
 
 SEC in its letter dated February 11, 2017, noted that Kurve should have been transferred as per chief secretaryâ€™s directives but this was not done. The GAD has therefore been asked to submit an explanation within three days.
 
 Two Nagpurians Satish Uke and Mohnish Jabalpure had lodged a complaint with SEC and also filed a petition in Nagpur bench of Bombay high court. SEC was made a party in the petition. SEC submitted its letter in its reply. The court has fixed the next date of hearing on March 3. Divisional commissioner Anoop Kumar maintains transfer of Kurve was not required for NMC elections as he was not the returning officer.
