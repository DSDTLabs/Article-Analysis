NAGPUR: Imagine a   where   in a  . As the second stranger tries to cross over, the first one asks him not to do it and even tries to scare him away by telling him  . What follows is suspense, thrill and an interesting twist in the play titled ‘Stop’, staged by Jaitala Vasahat, Chandan Nagar, as part of the 64th drama festival competition organized by Maharashtra Kamgar Kalyan Mandal, on Tuesday.Imagine a railway crossing where two strangers meet and get engaged in a war of words. As the second stranger tries to cross over, the first one asks him not to do it and even tries to scare him away by telling him horror stories. 

 As the drama unfolds, the first stranger (Prashant Khadse) tries his best to dissuade the other (Aniruddha Jagdade) from crossing over the railway line by telling him stories of ghosts that bring an element of horror. Prashant tells Aniruddha that no one can beat death. When time comes, death will take him away. This is the truth of life. But an unrelenting Aniruddha is bent on crossing the tracks. 
 
 In subsequent turn of events, Aniruddha who gets angry over every word spoken to him, starts a liking for Prashant. He even teasingly tells Prashant that though you are trying to save life by showing the dangers of crossing the railway line, no one would come to help you if something wrong happens to you. 
 
 As the talk progresses, Aniruddha gets suspicious of the motive of Prashant. Before a horrified Aniruddha could escape from the spot, Prashant throws him on the tracks in which he dies under the wheels of a train (shown symbolically). The suspense continues even after the incident as Aniruddha replaces Prashant the ghost to ‘guide’ a person trying to cross the line. 
 
 Nitin Thakre, writer and director of the play, says, “I tried to keep the element of suspense intact by introducing unexpected happenings.”
 
 Anurag Upadhyay, who watched the play, said, “It was a fabulous experience. Acting of the ghost was really great.”
