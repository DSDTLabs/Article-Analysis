After their last two 'VOOT Originals' — 'Shaadi Boys' and It’s not that simple — was well-received, VOOT has announced its next web series. UNTAG, a six-part series, delves into the lives of regular people — their dreams, inhibitions and struggles. 
It gives the audience a fresh and light perspective of six characters, each dealing with a tag imposed on him/her, trying to become much more than what the world has labelled them. The series features Meiyang Chang (Nischay), VJ Andy (Cyrus), Dipannita Sharma (Anahita), Shiv Pandit (Prithvi),   (Shikha) and   (Sumeet). It celebrates friendship, relationships, love and the uniqueness of each of these journeys. 
 Scripted by   and directed by Ashima Chibber, the story is not about not finding love from the world outside, but from within. It revolves around losing the tags, the hate, the labels, the fear and most importantly, the shame as it embodies the thought — ‘You’re different, you’re better than the tag you’ve been given’. 
 Monika Shergill, head of content, VOOT, said, “We are glad to announce this launch in partnership with Moto Z. UNTAG is a story of people living with tags and how it’s important to go beyond them as tags prevent you from becoming the best version of who you are.” 
 Rachna Lather, marketing head,   Mobility and  , said, “We are thrilled with this association. Like Moto Z with Moto Mods enables you to break away from mundane smartphone usage by allowing you to transform it in a snap. UNTAG is a journey of six individuals who are trying to break 
 away from the tags they have received from the society. We hope the viewers resonate with the key message of the show — different is better.”
