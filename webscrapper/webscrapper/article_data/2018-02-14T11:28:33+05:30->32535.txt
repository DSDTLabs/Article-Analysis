CHENNAI: It’s not just roses or expensive gifts that mark Valentine’s Day. 

 Now, cosmetic procedures see a blip close to the occasion. 28-year-old Priya Sarkar got herself a lip job a couple of days before Valentine’s Day. 
 
 “I had been meaning to use derma fillers to get the procedure done. Valentine’s Day seemed to offer better deals and there is also an occasion to time the procedure,” she said. 
 
 Cosmetic clinics and aesthetic physicians say that they see a 15%-30% jump in number of orders close to Valentine’s day. Common procedures include cosmetic non-surgical beautification treatments, botox procedures that cost anywhere between Rs 15,000 to even Rs 1,50,000. “Women mostly jump in for derma fillers in their lips and even complex procedures such as fat transfer closer to the occasion and Valentine’s Day stands next to wedding requests in terms of volume,” said Reema Arora, aesthetic physician at Cocoona Aesthetics, Delhi.
 
 While the ratio leans a little towards women going in for the procedures, close to 40% of the requests come from men, companies add. Some of the procedures take barely an hour and the effect is visible within two or three days, doctors add. 
 
 “We see a 30% increase in the number of orders in February, partly because of the occasion and also because of offers and discounts surrounding it. Men also opt for procedures such as beard shaping and laser therapy,” said Prabhu Mishra, CEO, StemGenn Therapeutics.
 
 With some procedures costing over Rs 50,000 a one-time payment may not be feasible. 
 
 Some firms even tie up with NBFCs for the occasion to offer short term loans for those seeking cosmetic procedures. 
 
 “There are packages offered towards the day and cosmetic procedures are the new trend in gifting. We are also bringing in EMI options on credit cards and pay later options by tying up with financial institutions,” said  , founder and CEO, ABC cosmetic clinic.
