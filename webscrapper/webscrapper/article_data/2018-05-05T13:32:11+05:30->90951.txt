Indore: The association of the ICSE   of Indore on Friday submitted a gazette notification before the Indore bench of high court showing extension of the deadline for installation of   and panic buttons in passenger vehicles till April 1, 2019.

 Based on the notification and other arguments forwarded by the petitioner, division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice  , granted stay to the petitioners and ordered that filing of the   by schools complying with guidelines fixed by district collector regarding school buses, was not mandatory till the next hearing. 
 
 The petitioner – regional association of schools affiliated with the CISCE – claimed that the gazette notification extending deadline for GPS and panic button implementation also applied to school buses. 
 
 “Since the gazette notification had been issued, the collector could not pressurize us to implement norms set by him. We made arguments challenging his guidelines before the court today following which the court granted a stay on the collector order directing schools to submit an affidavit of compliance with the fresh norms,” advocate Abhay Jain, representing the petitioner said.
 
 The writ appeal filed by the association of unaided CBSE schools had also been filed along with the petition by association of ICSE schools, which was adjourned by the court till summer vacation. 
 
 The district collector had directed schools to file an affidavit stating that all their buses had speed governors, limiting speed to 40 km per hour, seat belts for each seat, female attendant in each bus, among others. The order was passed following the DPS bus accident that claimed five lives on January 5.
 
 The two schools association had challenged the guidelines imposed by the district collector regarding school buses in Indore were in contravention with the guidelines set by the transport department, CBSE and the Supreme Court.
