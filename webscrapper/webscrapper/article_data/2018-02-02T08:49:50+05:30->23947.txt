MANGALURU:   (DCC) spokesperson AC Vinayaraj has slammed   leaders in Dakshina Kannada for making remarks on a   obtaining   in Mangaluru.

 Vinayaraj told reporters that even foreign nationals, who are residing in India for more than 182 days in the 12 preceding months, are eligible to apply for Aadhaar Card as per Aadhaar Act 2016. However, BJP leaders have been using Malaysian student's Aadhaar Card a political issue to target Congress, he said. 
 
 Lashing at Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, Vinayaraj said neither J R Lobo, MLA of Manglauru City South, nor any other Congress leaders, have recommended the authorities to issue Aadhaar Card to Malaysian student.
 
 “BJP leaders are trying to malign the Congress government in the state by spreading lies that Congress leaders have recommended the authorities to issue Aadhaar Card to Malaysian student. BJP leaders are not aware of Aadhaar Act 2016, which make provisions to issue Aadhaar Cards to all residents, including foreign nationals, who are staying for more than 182 days in the 12 months preceding the application. Let BJP leaders understand that Aadhaar Cards are being distributed by the central government and not the state government. Let leaders raise the issue in the Parliament, if they have objections in Aadhaar Cards being distributed to foreign nationals. Let them seek amendments to Aadhaar Act 2016 to prevent the issue of Aadhaar Cards to foreign nationals,” Vinayaraj said adding that Aadhaar Card is not a proof of citizenship, but just a proof of identity. 
 
 Further, he charged BJP leaders of making false allegations against MLA Lobo and the Congress government for political gains. “Assembly election in the state this year will be fought between development of state and lies of BJP."
