Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has told the UT administration to apprise the court of the terms of reference of the CBI probe in the Akansh Sen murder case on the next date of hearing on June 1.

 Earlier, the administration had informed the court that it had handed over the case to the CBI
 
 Sen, former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s relative, was allegedly crushed to death under the wheels of a BMW car in Sector 9 in the early hours of February 9 last year.
 
 The CBI counsel had submitted in the court that he had no information about the order passed by the administration.
 
 Regarding the trial of the case, the prosecution witness are recording their statements in the court of additional district and sessions judge in Chandigarh district court. If the case is transferred to the CBI, the investigation would again start from ground zero and the trial at district court would be suspended.
 
 Police had slapped a murder charge against two accused — Balraj Singh Randhawa and Harmehtab Singh.
 
 Harmehtab Singh was chargesheeted under Section 302 (punishment for murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC. Randhawa is absconding. A court has declared him a proclaimed offender. Chandigarh police had also raised the award money from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh on information leading to his arrest.
 
 The defence had argued that no offence was committed by Harmehtab as he was not the one who was driving the car. “It was Randhawa who was driving the vehicle and at the most Harmehtab could be charged with Sections 304 and not 302 of IPC,” the defence had said. It was also argued that it was a roadside accident and not intentional murder as Akansh Sen survived for a day and then succumbed to his injuries.
