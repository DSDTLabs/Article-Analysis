 Although the number of affiliated colleges has witnessed a drop this year, officials attribute the rise in seats to a few colleges fulfilling the norms this year. “Last year, we did not grant permission to few branches in existing colleges due to shortcomings such as lack of PhD qualified teachers. This year, colleges have fulfilled these norms and secured permissions resulting in a rise in seats,” said N Yadaiah, registrar of JNTUH.
 
 
 On the contrary, the number of engineering colleges being granted the All India Council of Technical Education’s (AICTE) nod increased this year. Total 228 colleges with an intake of 1,14,247 were granted AICTE approval as opposed to 181 colleges with an intake of 84,497 approved last year.
