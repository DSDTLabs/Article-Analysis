PATNA: There is possibility of rainfall with thunderstorm/dust storm over isolated places in the state for three days from Thursday, the Patna meteorological centre said on Tuesday.

 The   (IMD) also predicted thunderstorm accompanied by with squall at isolated places in the Gangetic West Bengal,   and Jharkhand on Thursday and Friday. “There is a possibility of fairly widespread to widespread rain and thundershowers over east India, northeast India and Andaman and Nicobar Islands for two days from Sunday,” the   bulletin said.
 
 Meteorologists blame the northwesterly winds blowing from the Arabian Sea and areas in Pakistan and Afghanistan for the persistent hot weather conditions in the state. “The maximum temperature may vary from 40 to 42 degrees Celsius. Apart from this, warm winds are likely to originate from Bihar’s Gangetic plains causing rise in temperature and dry weather for the next few days,”   (CUSB) department of environmental science’s associate professor and Indian Meteorological Society’s secretary for Bihar, Pradhan Parth Sarthi, said.
 
 The maximum temperature in Patna on Tuesday was recorded at 39.5 degrees C and Bhagalpur recorded the highest maximum temperature at 39.8 degrees Celsius.
 
 As per private weather agency Skymet Weather, the day temperatures are likely to remain above normal over in certain areas of east India. “Moreover, due to the moisture-laden winds that are travelling from the Bay of Bengal up to Bihar, uneasy conditions will increase across East India. In fact, with moisture in the air, the foothills of northeast Bihar and adjoining parts of West Bengal may observe thundershowers during the next 24 hours,” the agency’s bulletin said.
 
 For the prediction of thunderstorm and squall over portions of east India, the Skymet report attributed it to a cyclonic circulation over north Bihar and a trough extending up to north Odisha and across Jharkhand.
