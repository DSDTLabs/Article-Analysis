NEW DELHI: For a year now,   has been running from pillar to post seeking justice for his son Divyansh, who drowned in the septic tank at   School on January 30 last year. Dismayed by the slow pace of police investigation, Meena moved Delhi high court seeking a CBI probe into the circumstances of his son’s death. There was some respite for him when the cops filed the   on Saturday.

 “We came to know about the chargesheet from media reports,” Meena told TOI. “However, the charges are still of negligence when we believe that more severe charges could have been invoked given the way the school tried to hush up the incident.”
 
 After filing the chargesheet, police officers said the probe came to an end after forensic reports confirmed the boy’s death was due to drowning. “We examined all angles pointed out by the complainant and we will soon wind up the legal formalities,” said a senior officer.
 
 The school authorities have informed police that since the tragic incident, they have covered the tank and have taken security measures to prevent a repeat.
 
 The family had moved a plea in the high court seeking a CBI probe in the case. It comes up hearing in August. Meena continued to assert that he would not settle for an apology from the school.
 
 Meena said that unable to cope with the memories of their old house, they have since shifted to an apartment in Chhattarpur. “We have set up his room there as it was the day he left us a year ago,” revealed Meena, who works in the radiology department at AIIMS. He added that his wife Mamata still hasn’t come to terms with the sight of Divyansh’s empty room.
 
 The birth of a son on Christmas last year has left the family believing the boy is their late son reincarnated. They have named him Dev and the father said, “He behaves in the same way as Divyansh did.” The couple also have a daughter who studied earlier in Ryan International but has moved to a new institution after her brother’s death.
