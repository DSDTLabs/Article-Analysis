BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday passed an interim order directing the   (KEA) to permit a batch of petitioner-students holding   (OCI) cards to submit their applications offline for the Common Entrance Test (CET) 2018 for admission to engineering courses. The last date for submitting applications is February 26. 

  Justice B V Nagarathna noted that as per the amendment to Section 7A of the Citizenship Act in 2005, OCI card holders are on par with Indian citizens and in case of a repugnancy, as per Article 254 of the Constitution, the act passed by Parliament prevails. The judge said that during the earlier CET era, there were   and non-Karnataka quota seats and the government, in fact, encouraged students from outside to study here. 
 
 "They (central government) are inviting people to come and study here. But you are doing this," the judge told additional advocate-general A S Ponnanna in reference to rule 5(1)) of the Karnataka Selection of Candidates for Admission to Government Seats in Professional Educational Institutions Rules 2006 which restricted admission to Indian citizens only.
 
  The AAG, however, submitted that a division bench of the high court had already ruled that OCIs are not eligible for government quota seats in relation to a case where OCI students were not permitted to participate in counselling for admission to MBBS/BDS courses despite passing the NEET exam.
