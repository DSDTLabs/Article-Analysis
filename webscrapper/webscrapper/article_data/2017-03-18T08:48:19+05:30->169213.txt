GUWAHATI: Making it clear that they are opposed to granting ST status to six communities of the state, tribal leaders have called a convention here next week to chart out their next course of action against the proposal. 

 "We had earlier made our stand clear to the government on the proposed ST status to the six communities. This move is going to affect the rights and privileges of the existing tribal communities. The convention will discuss threadbare the pros and cons of the threat posed to the existing tribal communities if the government moves ahead with the proposed ST status," said All   Tribal Sangha (AATS) general secretary Aditya Khaklari. 
 
 AATS is the organizer of the convention.
 
 AATS's urgency in calling the convention came after chief minister   last week reiterated the state government's stand to ensure ST status to Koch Rajbongshis, Tai Ahoms, Morans, Motoks, Chutias and adivasis. These communities are currently in the OBC category.
 
 Granting ST status to the six communities is one of the electoral promises of the   government at the Centre and state. In March last year, the   had formed a committee under the Union home ministry for recommending modalities for reservations, shifting of existing reservations of six communities from OBC to ST, protecting the interest of existing tribes, and related security considerations.
