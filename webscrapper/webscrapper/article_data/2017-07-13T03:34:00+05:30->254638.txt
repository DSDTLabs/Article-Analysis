Panaji: Following the crackdown on two-wheeler riders travelling helmetless, there has been a significant increase in the number of challans issued to violators of this rule. Figures shared by the transport department revealed that over 20,000 more riders were challaned during the second quarter of this year compared to the first one. In North Goa alone, 32,102 helmetless riders were caught riding without helmets, while in the south, a total of 25,027 violators were caught. Thus, making a total of 57,129 violations detected from the period of April 1 to June 30 this year. This is as opposed to a total of 32,567 violations detected from January1 to March 31. Thus showing an increase of 24,562 violations detected. “It was a consolidated effort by the traffic cell and the enforcement of the road transport officers to catch the violators, thus leading to the increase in number of cases booked. The basic idea here is not to challan more people, but to ensure that two-wheeler riders travel safely. We are optimistic that the crackdown will bring discipline among people to wear a helmet, while riding,” said deputy superintendent of police, North Goa traffic cell, Dharmesh Angle. Sources from the transport department informed that the violators were fined Rs 100 for the violation and most of them were directed to counselling. Figures further revealed that of these 57,129 violators, a total of 56,893 violators were counselled in the second quarter. Section 129 of the Central Motor Vehicle Act states that two-wheeler riders should wear protective headgear while travelling. However, despite this rule being in place, the state police department issued a strict advisory only last month. Their advisory was also extended to pillion riders found travelling without helmets. The department, however, had to roll back its plans within hours of announcing it, since they realized that the state’s motor vehicle Act does not have any provision about pillion riders wearing helmets.
