Apart from Goel and Ramachandran; Injeti Srinivas, director general of Sports Authority of India and Inder Damjia, joint secretary, sports, also attended the meeting.
 The ministry also advised the IOA to write to the government seeking approval for the bidding of the Asian Beach Games in 2020.
 
 "We are confident that Asian Beach Games will come to India, provided we start the bidding process without any delay. It's a big event and if we can host it successfully, our claim for the Asian Games will be stronger. We're working together and hopefully will win it," the source added.
 
 India has never hosted an   session before and the ministry has agreed to organise it in 2021 in the National Capital Region (NCR). Moreover, there are also proposals to bid for the Olympic Games either in 2028 or 2032.
