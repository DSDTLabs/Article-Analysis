THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government is likely to appoint DGP   as the head of the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB). Sources said the DGP will take charge of the agency next week as part of the government's move to shuffle top cops. 

 A 1986 batch officer,   is currently posted as special officer in the Kerala House in New Delhi after he completed his tenure as ADGP in the Central Reserve Police Force. Following the retirement of T P Senkumar on June 30 as the state police chief, Asthana has been elevated to the league of the four senior-most DGPs for being appointed to the two cadre posts and the corresponding two ex-cadre posts of DGPs sanctioned by the Centre in the state.
 
 Asthana's elevation was confirmed after it became clear that   of 1984 batch who was originally expected to come back to the cadre, has dropped the idea. Sinha, who is currently a joint director rank official in the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and is based in Washington, would have been the senior-most DGP in the state had he decided to come back to the cadre. 
 
 No major changes are expected for the officers of 1986 batch excluding Asthana who have been elevated by state government to the rank of DGPs. These include A Hemachandran, currently the commandant general of fire and rescue services, N Shanker Reddy, the director of state crime records bureau (SCRB), Rajesh Dewan, DGP (north zone) and B S Muhammed Yasin, the director of intelligence.
 
 It is learnt that the government will take a decision on ADGP Tomin J   after the high court delivers its verdict on a petition against him. Thachankary has been facing several charges against him.
