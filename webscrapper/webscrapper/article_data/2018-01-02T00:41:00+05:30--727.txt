Tirunelveli: Wondering to whom you can report open defecation and use of banned plastic items? The Namma Nellai app by the district administration serves as the platform where you can report it at ease along with pictures of the place. “This year we are seriously looking at imposing ban on the use of banned thin plastic items such as carry bags,” said district collector Sandeep Nanduri. Under the ‘Spot & Report Plastic’ column on the homepage, people can report incidents of traders selling or persons dumping plastic bags or disposable plastic items that are less than 50 micron in thickness. They can also click pictures and provide more details for enabling speedy action. There is a similar provision for reporting open defecation under the SBM (Swachh Bharat Mission) column in the home page. On accessing these sections a pop up seeks permission to get the location details of the mobile phone. This is to help the users to report such issues at ease. However the location access is not functioning as of now. Officials said they are working on to get it fixed and make it more convenient for the public to report harm caused to the environment. Till then, public can choose the location and report the issue by choosing the type of local body (corporation, municipality, town panchayat or village panchayat) where the issue is taking place from a drop-down menu. The Swachh Bharat Mission section in the home page also has a ‘Volunteer for a cause’ column in which public can volunteer for the various cleanliness drives in the district such as Clean Tamirabarani (River). Individuals, a group of friends, education institutions and corporate houses can participate in the same. Interested persons can also choose the number of days they would like to volunteer and the exact number of dates on which they would like to volunteer for the cleanliness drives.
