 'Savdhaan India', one of the longest-running crime shows, is ending abruptly as the channel has decided to pull the plug on it. The production houses involved in making the show, which has been running for the past six years, and its host —   — have been informed about the decision. A source from one of the production houses tells us, “The channel hasn’t given us the last date of telecast yet. They have told us that they will bring back the show after a short break, but we don’t see that happening. An overnight decision like this can hamper the career of a lot of people.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lady luck seems to be smiling on Shoaib Ibrahim. The actor, who tied the knot with his 'Sasural Simar Ka' co-actor   on February 23, following a five-year courtship, is back to work. He has been zeroed in on as the new male lead opposite the protagonist,  , in Kinnari and Jay Mehtaa’s 'Jeet Gaye Toh Piya Morre'. The actor was roped in after the makers decided overnight to wind up the original hero, Krrip Kapur Suri’s track in a bit to spruce up the drama and introduce a generation leap of 18 years. Shoaib will romance Yesha, who will play her own daughter post the leap.
