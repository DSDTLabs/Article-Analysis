NAVI MUMBAI: Animal lovers and several citizens in   have asked authorities to carry out   programmes in the node for controlling the growing stray dog population.

 “None of the government agencies are carrying out Animal Birth Control (ABC) measures in Kharghar and neighbouring areas. There has been a spurt in the dog population in all sectors. In sector 18, I have seen at least two lactating female  , which means that they have recently given birth. The newly formed Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) must take serious measures,” said Kharghar-based animal activist Anand Siva.
 
 Along with other animal welfare workers, many Mumbai-based NGOs have been asked to try and visit the node and help in carrying out sterilizations till the time a proper body is authorized to conduct the ABC programme.
 
 Another Kharghar activist, Ravi Srivastava, said, “I have sent messages to the PCMC chief about the urgent need to carry out a mass sterilization drive as this is the only legal and humane way to control stray population.” 
 
 Senior official of PCMC health and sanitation department, Shailesh Gaikwad, they were looking out to appoint an NGO for the sterilizations. But till then the residents could approach Cidco too, Gaikwad said.
 
 Activist Srivastava contested the PCMC official’s claim saying PCMC was established on October 1, 2016 and hence in the last 12 months they should have also anticipated the stray menace. 
 
 “We have found some dubious animal welfare groups are in the race to bag the ABC contract for PCMC. We request the municipal corporation to grant it the best possible animal NGO so that they can effectively carry out the sterilization prgramme without indulging in corrupt practices,” Srivastava said.
