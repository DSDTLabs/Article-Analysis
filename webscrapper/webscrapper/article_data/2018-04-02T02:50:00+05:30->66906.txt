Nagpur: There are many studies about Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) but little attention has been paid to pregnancy complications arising due to the hormonal disorder, said Dr Kanchan Sortey, new president of The Nagpur Obstetric and Gynaecological Society, here on Sunday. 

 Dr Sortey spoke on the challenges for pregnancy in PCOS, a hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age. The condition causes a woman’s body to produce excessive amounts of hormones that are associated with male sex characteristics and reproduction.
 
 “India has been declared as the diabetic capital of the world, and diabetes has close association with PCOS. There are various factors related to PCOS during pregnancy. Some of them are hyperandrogenism, obesity, metabolic abnormalities, excessive use of infertility drugs, among others,” she said, adding that 60%   are obese and this may be responsible for increased incidence of PCOS.
 
 Once a PCOS patient conceives, several challenges await her — early pregnancy loss, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia (characterized by high blood pressure), increased risk of multiple pregnancy, premature delivery and increased instances of operative delivery.
 
 “Various studies have found that there is a fivefold increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients, threefold increase in gestational diabetes and two-fold risk of premature delivery. Studies have also predicted metabolic and reproductive dysfunction in such patients,” Dr Sortey said.
 
 “Obesity has many pregnancy complications such as miscarriage and risk of assisted vaginal deliveries. Obesity is an independent risk factor for gestational diabetes. There is risk of adverse fetal outcome in obese pregnancies,” said Sortey.
 
 Chief guest Dr Nandita Palshetkar spoke on ‘Challenges of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) in PCOS’. Psychiatrist Dr Rajendra Barve gave a talk on the psychological changes in women’s life.
