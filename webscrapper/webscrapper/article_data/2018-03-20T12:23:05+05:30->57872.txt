Kangana Ranaut’s speech and comments at a recent summit are widely being talked about. However, not many would know that the actress also had a chance to meet Prime Minister   at the same summit’s gathering meant for a select few invitees. Since Kangana was travelling from Manali, after her family holiday and the griha pravesh pooja for her new house, for the event held in Delhi, she decided to reach the venue a day prior to her session to avoid loss of time or any other eventuality. 

 
 
  
 
  The day she arrived in Delhi, the organisers of the event informed her about a meeting they had lined up for her with the Prime Minister. An intimate group of influential people from different walks of life were in the hall where Kangana met the PM.

  Kangana, in her brief meeting, exchanged pleasantries with PM Modi and also attended his session at the summit. The ‘Manikarnika’ actress, on several occasions, has stated that she’s a fan of Modi’s speeches and feels he’s a visionary.
