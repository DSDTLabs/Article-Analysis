DARJEELING: Lashing out at Bimal Gurung’s statement expressing his willingness to talk to the   government, the Binay Tamang-led Gorkha   on Friday branded him “BJP’s puppet”.

  general secretary   accused his former party president of misleading people. “Under Gurung’s leadership, three agitations took place. But his lack of political vision made all the agitations a failure. He rakes up the statehood demand as per his whims,” he said.
 
 “Gurung is blackmailing people sentimentally in the name of Gorkhaland, saying he was facing hardship in the jungles. We have information that he is living comfortably in Delhi with 15-20 trusted cadres. He only wants to save himself from the several cases slapped against him and come back to power taking BJP’s support. He is now merely a BJP puppet,” Thapa added.
 
 GNLF, on its part, said it would be foolish of   to seek BJP support to regain hold of the Hills.
