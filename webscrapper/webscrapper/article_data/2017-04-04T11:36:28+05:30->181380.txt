PANAJI: The excise department has begun the process of scrutinizing licences of   vends within 220m of national and state highways to avail of the Supreme Court’s distance relaxation afforded to small municipal areas with a population of 20,000 and less, even as it awaits further directions from the government. It is also determining the areas that comply with this population criteria.

 Post the December 2016 SC order, the excise department had conducted a survey during which it was found that 3,200-odd licences fell within 500m of either national or state highways, of which 800-1,000 are expected to benefit from the apex court’s modified order.
 
 “We have started analysing licences within 220m,” said excise commissioner Menino D’Souza and added the excise inspectors have been provided with a list of licences in their respective jurisdictions.
 
 Not commenting on the government’s next course of action to bail out affected traders, D’Souza said chief minister   will announce his decision on Tuesday. “We are waiting directions from the government,” D’Souza said when prodded further.
 
 An official said most villages in the state have a population less than 20,000, and, hopefully, the number of liquor businesses affected will reduce considerably. 
 
 Villages such as Taleigao, Sancaole and Curti-Khandepar with a population of more than 20,000 will not benefit, officer said.
 
 A source said the government is also looking at de-notifying certain national/state highways to bring some relief to those affected by the order.
 
 On the other hand, liquor trader are extremely unhappy and want the government to find a way to bail out affected licences. They also want the government to approach the apex court seeking relief for Goa.
