NEW DELHI: Congress president   on Monday alleged that finance minister   was silent on the   scam because his lawyer daughter was engaged by diamond baron   for legal work.

 As the opposition protests over the bank scam continued in Parliament for the second week, Rahul tweeted, “It’s now revealed that our FM’s silence on the PNB scam was to protect his lawyer daughter, who was paid a large retainer by the accused just a month before the scam became public. When other law firms of the accused have been raided by the  , why not hers?” The tweet came with the hashtag ‘Modi robs India’ and tagged a media report on the issue.
 
 According to the media report, Jaitley’s son-in-law had confirmed receiving the retainership in December 2017, but added that he cancelled the engagement when the PNB scam came to light before any legal work could be referred to it.
