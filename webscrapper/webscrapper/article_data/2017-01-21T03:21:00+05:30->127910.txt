NEW DELHI: Two days after a 21-year-old woman was ruthlessly stabbed by her   at her house in  , her family told the police that the accused also stole Rs 25,000 and an ATM card from her  .

 “We didn’t get a chance to look at her belongings in the past two days. But last night when we were searching for the  , we just found a Rs 10 coin in her bag. We then realised that her attackers must have fled with the cash,” said the survivor’s sister. They said she had been saving money to buy a dress for her cousin’s upcoming wedding.
 
 Police are questioning the woman’s attackers, Amit and his cousin Basant, to ascertain if they stole the cash. The survivor is in the ICU of Safdarjung hospital and she is not yet out of danger. Doctors said her health may improve in a couple of days.
 
 The survivor’s family also claimed that they had noticed Amit lurking around the playschool she taught at. “My sister often told me that Amit had been troubling her. He had threatened to harm her if she didn’t accept his proposal. We took the threats lightly and didn’t inform the police,” said the survivor’s sister.
 
 The school authorities are being questioned and CCTV footage is being scanned to ascertain whether Amit used to trouble the woman when she went to work.
