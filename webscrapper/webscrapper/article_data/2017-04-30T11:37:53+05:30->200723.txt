Nestled in the foothills of the   and  , this village is an artist’s haven, drawing people from around the world. Landmarks of what is now known as “art village” include replicas of Bollywood icons Prithvi  ,   and a mud theatre built in the 1920s. The tourist inflow consists of aspiring artists, theatre persons, painters, dancers and musicians. 

 For all this, there is no tourist infrastructure. The place is devoid of hotels, eating joints and street lights. An unfinished hotel, toilets, restaurant and other tourism infrastructure is languishing under lock and key. 
 
 Family members of Sobha Singh have dug into their own meagre resources to expand the gallery. Dr Hirday Paul Singh, secretary general,   said the family wants to continue to display works of the legendry artist in Andretta as he loved this place. He has been writing to the government to initiate tourism-oriented projects in the village but nothing has been done yet. Similarly, family members of Gurcharan Singh host a theatre show in memory of Norah Richards. 
 
 Andretta Panchyat president Kusum Kumari says the village has attained its iconic status on its own. However, district tourism officer Jagan Thakur said projects for the village are underway. He said he has joined recently but there is focus on tourism promotion in the area. Meanwhile,   members also visited the area and said they have plans for the promotion of its artistic legacy.
