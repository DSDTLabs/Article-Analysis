Remember the Malayali boy,  , who made news after acting in a soft drink ad with Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni? Well, Anil has been a known name in the ad world since, and had acted in the films Idukki Gold and Puthiya Niyamam as well.
 
 After a short sabbatical to complete his studies, the mechanical engineering graduate, who is all grown up now, is all set to further his career in films. His latest movie Kaly, alongside four other former child actors, was appreciated for its innovative approach. However, Anil says that youth films don’t get as much of an audience as those which have big stars. 
  
 “The initial collections of youth-oriented films with no prominent stars are highly disappointing. Nevertheless, if the film is good, it will be successful. Kaly managed to run for almost 30 days in theatres,” says Anil, who played the childhood of Babu Antony in Idukki Gold.
 
  
  
  
 The Malayali audience, he says, will accept a film if it is good, no matter how big or small it is. “Angamaly Diaries, for instance, though it had two big names attached to it - Lijo Jose Pellisserry and Chemban Vinod,” he says.
  
 Anil still feels that it all feels like a dream when he recollects his one-minute ad with Virat Kohli and Dhoni at DY Patil stadium in Mumbai. "I could not believe that I would get to meet Virat and Dhoni. We had five days’ travel and shot across Gangtok, Mumbai and Kolkata,” says Anil, adding that ads were my acting school. “I consider myself lucky to be part of ads with Virat Kohli, Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan. I also did an ad with actor Saquib Saleem,” he says.
