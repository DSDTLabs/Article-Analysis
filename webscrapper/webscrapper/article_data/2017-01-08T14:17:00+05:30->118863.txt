Actress   says she feels 'lonely' as a woman on set as very less number of females are part of the crew. 

  
  
 The 'Guardians of the Galaxy' star said she feels disappointed as she hardly gets to work with any women directors. "I feel lonely on set. And it's not just that you're the only woman in the cast. There are very few women on the crew. You hardly ever get to work with a female director."
 
 "Some female producers try to blend in with their male colleagues and won't stand up to them. You're completely outnumbered. And you take a hit in your paycheck as a woman too. I'm so tired of it," Saldana said.
