LUKCNOW: Shaken by the scale of fraud detected at diesel and   in Uttar Pradesh, oil marketing companies have decided to revise their marketing discipline guidelines.

 “Rules set up for oil companies have remained the same since 2008. They need to be overhauled to check fraudulent practices in order to impose stricter penalties on dealers,” said an IPS who attended a meeting of representatives of petroleum companies with chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar and other senior government officials in Lucknow on Tuesday.
 
 The revised guidelines will focus on regular checks, strict quality control measures, sealing of machines and dispensing units among other procedures. The oil companies have been asked to take help of IITs to design full-proof security measures and implement them across the country.
 
 As enhanced security feature, a magnetic encryption unit is being considered to be installed in petrol dispensing machines which will collapse on being tampered. The collapsible unit will encase the pulser through which calibration is done. Petrol dealers had been tampering with the pulser to shortchange consumers. 
 
 Earlier too, tampering by electronic chips and remote units has been detected in the country. In Mansa, Punjab, liquor pilferage was detected through electronic chips in March 2013.
