 has quashed rumours that her boyfriend   is cheating on her. 

  
  
 The   hitmaker posted a response on Twitter to a story that had surfaced about the former   singer getting close to a backing dancer and another "mystery woman" in Dubai.
 
  
  
 "I usually don't bother myself to respond to stupid articles. But in my silence they hold the pen. This is a stupid article, clutching at very small straws. But I can't ignore this story involving an innocent dancer colleague of Liam's who has a fiance, and dragging them into this desperate attempt to try and cause problems between Liam and I. 
 
 "Nor do I understand the almost daily onslaught of stories. The other 'mystery woman' in the story happens to my long term friend and manager (that's embarrassing). I also happen to love  ," Cheryl wrote. 
 
 The singer confessed to loving Perry after Payne shared a photo of himself with her, and later followed up her post with another tweet confirming that she and Payne are happily enjoying the   holiday together.
