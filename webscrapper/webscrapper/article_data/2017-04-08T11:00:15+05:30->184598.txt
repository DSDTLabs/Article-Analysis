Three days before his death, Dudhani had been released on bail in a case of rape, cheating, assault and criminal breach of trust lodged by the other woman with the Kondhwa police. 
 
 Taking cognisance of the video, the Market Yard police registered an offence under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against the woman and her aides. The trio since moved the high court for anticipatory bail, arguing that the video recording did not disclose an offence of abetment against them. 
 
 Justice Revati Mohite Dere, while granting the anticipatory bail on March 3, described the suicide as unfortunate. The bench, however, observed, "A perusal of the transcript of the deceased's statement shows that to a great extent he was guilty of having ignored his wife and children, and for having spent time with the applicant no.1 (the other woman). Although there are a few sentences that the applicants were blackmailing him, nothing (call data records) was placed on record by prosecutor."
 
 A transcript of Dudhani's video-recorded statement showed that after his release on bail, his wife attempt suicide by consuming poison. 
 
 The court has directed that the applicants be released on bail against personal release bonds of Rs 50,000 each and one or two sureties in the like amount. They have to report to the Market Yard police station every Monday till the filing of chargesheet, and then on the first Monday every month till the conclusion of trial.
