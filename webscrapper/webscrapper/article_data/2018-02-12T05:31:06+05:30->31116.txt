CHENNAI: Around 400 doctors, students and other members of the public held a rally at Elliot’s Beach,  , on Sunday spreading awareness about   – a viral infection that causes congenital anomalies.

 The ‘walk’, organised by International Inner Wheel, a women’s voluntary organisation, and Dr Mehta’s Hospitals, Chetpet, was inaugurated by deputy commissioner of police Rohit Nathan.
 
 Banners and placards displaying slogans in Tamil and English on dangers of ignoring rubella and the importance of vaccination were held by the students.
 
 Last year, the central government had introduced the measles-rubella vaccine in the government-sponsored immunisation programme. Although the campaign was to wind up by the end of February, officials faced resistance from a section of parents, forcing them to prolong the drive.
 
 Rubella, or  , is a contagious viral infection that causes a distinctive red rash. Though there are no statistics on its prevalence, the health ministry says the disease is endemic in India. It spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can also be passed on from mother to the newborn. Experts say more than two lakh children in India and at least 2,000 in   are born deaf, blind, or with heart or brain damage every year due to the congenital rubella syndrome. Officials claim at least 40-50% of the congenital infections can be checked by the vaccines.
