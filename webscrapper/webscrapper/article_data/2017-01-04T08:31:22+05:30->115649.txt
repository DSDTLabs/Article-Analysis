AHMEDABAD: A citizen goes to an unnamed government office and asks about his file stuck there for a considerable time. The man at the table nonchalantly tells him that there would be no progress without a suitable bribe. Finally, through a peon the citizen agrees to pay - after informing the   ( ).

 This is one of the seven case studies illustrated in ‘Bhrashtachar no Jad-Mul thi Ant’ (Eradication of corruption from its roots), a booklet jointly published by state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and   (GSLSA), recently. ACB officials hope to get it included in school curricula as part of civics studies. 
 
 Keshav Kumar, special director, ACB, told TOI that the idea behind the booklet was to clarify what is corruption and how to report it. “It’s not always exchange of cash that accounts for corruption. It can also be in kind, like demanding favours or siphoning off goods or things meant for a certain section of the society. We have tried to widen the concept,” he said.
 
 H S Mulia, member secretary, GSLSA, said the booklet was an effort to simplify the concepts and reach out to maximum audience in the language they could understand. “It would surely help the public understanding various provisions of the governing law,” he said. ACB officials said that they chose illustrations that could connect to the maximum audience. Relevant sections and legal provisions have also been included along with phone numbers of all ACB offices. 
 
 Kumar said that hundreds have used the toll-free helpline (1064) each year to report cases in addition to their Facebook page and WhatsApp number (9586800870). “A number of such cases get successfully converted in traps. We hope that the distribution of the booklet among citizens and schools would result in awareness about the issue,” he said.
