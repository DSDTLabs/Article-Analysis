LUCKNOW: The   suspected to have attacked a junior in school this week was on Thursday sent to juvenile home till January 31 by the juvenile justice board. Police said the seven-year-old victim told them the girl attacked him because she wanted the school to close early that day. Meanwhile,  , the manager of the school,  , was arrested on Thursday on the charges of destroying evidence and concealing information. The boy was attacked on Tuesday, but the school informed police only on Wednesday, after the matter was reported in the media. Manas, however, managed to get bail in the evening.

 
 The 12-year-old alleged assailant was detained after she was identified by the victim. The boy, who had described the girl as “a didi with a boy cut”, identified her from CCTV footage obtained by police from the school. The members of Lucknow’s child welfare committee objected to the juvenile justice board’s decision to send the girl to an observation home. The suspect’s father alleged that her daughter was being framed by the school authorities and police. The boy, whose condition is still critical, is undergoing treatment at King George’s Medical University.
 
 Police have recovered a kitchen knife, which it is suspected might have been used in the crime, along with a red stole and a shoe from the toilet where the boy was attacked. While the shoe belongs to the boy, police said it had sent the knife and the stole for forensic examination. Traces of hair found on the boy’s sweater have also been sent for forensic examination, an officer said. Earlier in the day, Uttar   chief minister   visited the victim at the hospital, where parents of other students had also gathered to protest against lack of security on the school campus and the alleged attempt to cover up the case. Parents also claimed that their daughters were strip-searched on the day of the incident.
