  , Folk/Fusion Alternative Rock 

 
 Formed in 2015, this five-piece folk/fusion alternative rock band, started composing songs that depicted the various hidden aspects and emotions of this world. And that is what prompted them to name their band Aankh Micholi. “In a way, our songs are both fun and meaningful and this name perfectly describes these aspects of our music,” says  , the vocalist, guitarist and lyricist of the band. 
 
 Over the last two years, they have performed live at various colleges, corporate events and commercial venues and even managed to bag an endorsement deal during one of their shows. “That is our biggest achievement till date,” they chorus. For Aankh Micholi, it is all about experimenting, meeting people, creating new music and above all, enjoying the entire process. 
 
 The band comprising Osho, Bharat Chandore (drums, percussions), Hansel Dias (bass),   (keyboards, production) and   (guitars) are very interactive. “We enjoy the feeling of the crowd singing along to our songs. People of all age groups love our music. And there’s no language barrier as well because we sing in many languages,” says Osho. 
 
 The best thing that they enjoy doing as a band is to randomly come up with ideas for songs in every jam.   says, “We just start playing random stuff and suddenly, we come up with a riff or a chorus, which eventually builds the song. We experience a different energy and bond amongst ourselves on stage, which takes our live performances to a whole new level.”
