MUMBAI: The state transport minister   has written to Union minister   asking him to reconsider   under the Central Motor Vehicle Act.

 Raote had also requested all transporters in Maharashtra to take back the January 31 strike. 
 
  Maharashtra transporters including bus operators have threatened a daylong statewide token strike on January 31, for protesting increase in the fees prescribed in Central Motor Vehicle Rules (CMVR) and other pending issues.
 
 Raote said that since there are elections in most parts of the state, and if the strike happens that can lead to a law and order situation in the state and so the transporters should think about their decision once again.
 
 "We are trying to convince the Union government to rethink on the increase in the charges," said Raote.
 
 The strike could have an effect on the movement of goods in and out of the state besides the increase in the fees the strikers also want to highlight, frequent increase in diesel price, mandatory speed governor for vehicles, delay in renewal of fitness certificate from RTOs.
