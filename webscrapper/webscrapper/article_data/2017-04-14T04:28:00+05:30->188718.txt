AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday refused to remain a   after 105 of 182   in the trial for the   Amit Jethava.

 During the hearing, Justice J B Pardiwala asked specific questions about what action the Gujarat police, Central Bureau of Investigation and the CBI court took on complaints about coercion and pressure on witnesses from ex-BJP MP and key accused in the case, Dinu Bogha Solanki and his nephew Shiva Solanki. On getting negative replies, the judge remarked, “When all remained silent, now HC too should remain silent? I cannot shut my eyes and remain mute spectator.”
 
  Jethava’s father, Jethalal has sought a retrial after so many witnesses turned hostile and no action was taken despite some of them making complaints about being pressurized before the CBI court.
 
  Amid heated arguments between Jethalal’s advocate and lawyers representing Solanki, the HC asked the petitioner to join five other accused persons in the proceedings. 
 
 The court also ordered to implead a key witness, Rama Haja, who was allegedly present at the meeting where the conspiracy was hatched.
 
 Meanwhile, the CBI urged the court not to order a re-trial or recall witnesses who turned hostile in the case, but agreed to the recall of eight eyewitnesses in the case. They are the high court employees. Jethava was shot dead in front of the HC campus.
 
 The petitioner also urged the HC to direct the CBI to probe into why such a large number of witnesses turned hostile despite various witnesses complaining to the court about threats from the accused. The petitioner also sought action against those responsible in this case.
 
 The petitioner highlighted how Gujarat police did not act on the CBI court’s order to probe charges of threats and coercion against Solanki. He has accused the BJP-run government of supporting Solanki.
 
 Further hearing in this matter shall be on April 18.
