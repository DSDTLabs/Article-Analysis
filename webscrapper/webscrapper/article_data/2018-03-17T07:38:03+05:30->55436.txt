HYDERABAD: It was a day of double tragedy for   with two of its passengers – on board separate flights from Dubai – being brought in dead to Hyderabad airport, on Friday, within eight-nine hours.

 The first incident took place on a   flight, EK 526, that touched down at the   (RGIA) at 8.40am. Sources said the elderly passenger was travelling to the city for medical treatment. “While, as per protocol, medical aid was rushed in to attend to the passenger, it was found that the flier had passed away. It is possible that the passenger suffered a cardiac arrest,” said a source.
 
 Even Emirates, while confirming the incident, failed to divulge further information. “The passenger sadly passed away in the terminal on arriving in Hyderabad,” read an official statement issued by the airline operator.
 
 Hours later, the airline staff was rattled by yet another death, this time on a flight from Dubai to Bangkok. The flight, EK 327, that took off from Dubai around 9.50am (local time) was diverted to the Shamshabad facility following a medical emergency. “It landed at RGIA around 4.30pm. Again, medical teams were pressed into service to assist the passenger with deplaning and providing treatment. But by then, the flier had died,” said a source. Though the airline did not furnish any detail about the passenger, sources indicated that she was woman who too, in all probability, had passed away while onboard the aircraft.
 
 “Emirates confirms that flight EK372 was diverted to Hyderabad due to a medical emergency. Sadly, on arrival the passenger was confirmed to have passed away,” the official statement stated.
 
 At the time of going to press, it was reliably learnt, that immigration procedures were underway at RGIA to send the body back to Dubai.
