 “Good infrastructure, international cirrculum and accreditation from reputed agencies of US, Austrialia and Europe are some of the solutions to attract local talent,” Sapkal said.

 Director general of   (CSIR), ISRO directors, professors of IITs and NITs and   president are members of the panel.
 
 The panel’s mandate is to suggest ways to improve standards of post graduate education and research in engineering, and increase industry participation.
