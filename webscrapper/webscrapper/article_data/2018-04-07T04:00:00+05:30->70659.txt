 Mumbai: Foreign investors are now free to enhance their total exposure in India’s government bonds by half a percentage point during the current fiscal (FY19) and by another half a percentage point during FY20. On Friday, the RBI, however, said that   ( ) will now be allowed to invest up to 5.5% of outstanding stock of government securities (G-secs) in 2018-19 and 6% of outstanding stock of securities in 2019-20. The   said that ploughing-back of interest income from   in the same instrument that had no limits will now be included within the overall G-sec limits for FY19 and FY20.
 
 The central bank also set a 9% limit for FPI investment in corporate bonds. It, however, did not enhance FPIs’ exposure to bonds issued by the states, called SDLs. 
 
 Bond dealers said that since the market was expecting a hike of one percentage point for FPIs’ exposure to G-secs in each of the next two fiscals, the RBI decision would lead to some hardening of rates. The inclusion of coupon reinvestment within the overall limits is also not favourable for a rise in bond prices. Yields on bonds and prices are inversely related. On Friday, the benchmark yield on 10-year government securities (G-secs) hardened in closing trades and settled at 7.17%, up from its previous close at 7.13%.
 
 The RBI said that in FY19, the cumulative FPI investments in G-sec could go up to Rs 2.07 lakh crore, up from Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while in FY20 the limit has been set at Rs 2.23 lakh crore. In corporate bonds, the limit for FY19 has been set at Rs 2.67 lakh crore, while in FY20 the limit is set at Rs 2.89 lakh crore. The cumulative figure at the end of FY20, including all the categories of bonds in which foreign investors can invest, could go up to Rs 6.5 lakh crore, up from Rs 5.46 lakh crore now, the RBI data showed.
