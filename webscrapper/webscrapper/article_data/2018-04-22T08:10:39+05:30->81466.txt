CHENNAI: A majority of the thousands of migratory birds that flocked to water bodies in the city and surrounding areas may have left as the season comes to an end, but a sighting of the pied myna, or Asian pied starling, at   marshland last week has thrilled naturalists.

 Nature Trust founder   told TOI the pied myna (Sturnus contra) rarely strayed from Andhra Pradesh, where it was found in large numbers.
 
 Since 2010, when it was spotted in the   on Chennai’s outskirts, a couple of the birds have been seen in various places in and around the city, said Madras Naturalists’ Society member V Santharam.
 
 During this period, a pair was seen in the Korattur lake, while a pair was spotted on top of a nest in Kancheepuram, said Thirunaranan.
 
 Grey-tailed tattler from Australia, sighted in the Pulicat lake last year, has been seen in the same place this year also, Thirunaranan said. The bird watchers who recorded the sighting were not sure it was a tattler (Tringa brevipes), as the bird resembles a sandpiper, and was seen along with Terek sandpiper and ruddy turnstone, both migratory birds. “I think it is a juvenile, a vagrant that could have come with other migratory birds. It is very surprising to see a variety of birds still found in the Pulicat bird sanctuary,” he said.
 
 The Pulicat bird sanctuary, located around 100km from Chennai, boasts of more than 100 species of birds which include such rare migrant visitors. In the last few years, birdwatchers have recorded sighting at least half a dozen rare birds in the Tamil Nadu’s part of the sanctuary. Sighting of such rare birds in this part of the lake indicates the   of the habitat, Thirunaranan added.
