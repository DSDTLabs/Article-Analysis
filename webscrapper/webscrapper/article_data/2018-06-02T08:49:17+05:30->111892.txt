HYDERABAD: The discontinuation of   in engineering, agriculture and pharmacy courses for 2018-19 has left scores of students in a lurch.

 The decision to scrap the quota was taken by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) at a time when the state government earmarked two percent reservation in jobs for sportspersons.
 
 
  
 
 Until last year, the counselling process for   was held with NCC and special category candidates. However, this year,   quota was scrapped by the authorities forcing qualified candidates to run from pillar to post to secure   college of their choice.
 
 Among them is national level table tennis player who despite securing a good score in the common entrance test has been struggling to get admission in an engineering college. “In the past year, I won six national level medals. I presumed that on the basis of my performance, I will secure a seat in a reputed college. However, scrapping of the quota has come as a shock for me,” said Subramanyam, an aspirant.
 
 Parents too are irked by the government’s decision which on the other hand is encouraging sportspersons for government jobs. “@KTRTRS , @PadmaRaoGoud appreciate the Telangana government’s decision to increase the sports quota to 2 percent (in government jobs). But my son B Abhishek who is seeking admission into Eamcet in sports quota feels deprived as the sports quota is made void for this year. Please help to revive it this year,” tweeted Parshuram, a parent.
 
 According to officials, there was a spurt in cases where the quota was misused for admission into reputed colleges. When TOI contacted B Srinivas, Eamcet camp officer, he said that they are awaiting orders from the Sports Authority of Telangana. “The state constituted acommittee of SAT members to identify games which will be considered for admissions. After we receive communication, we will conduct counselling under sports quota,” he said.
