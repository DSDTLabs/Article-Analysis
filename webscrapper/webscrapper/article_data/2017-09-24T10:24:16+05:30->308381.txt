HYDERABAD: Finding fault with the authorities for resorting to ad hoc measures and not striving for concrete and clear solutions for vexatious problems like preparing the seniority list of DSPs and circle inspectors for several years, the Hyderabad high court has directed the state of   (cadre controlling authority) and its DGP to prepare a clear seniority list of DSPs and CIs within six months. Till then, the allocation of DSPs in the states of AP and   cannot be taken up, the bench of Justice   and   said.

 Before pronouncing the judgment, the bench heard at length a batch of petitions filed by several DSPs, CIs and others who were aggrieved by the seniority lists prepared by AP authorities and its DGP. The bench, in its order, said that the seniority list is admittedly full of lapses and defects.
 
 Speaking for the bench, Justice   said: “Allowing such a seniority list to be the basis for final allocation of DSPs between the two newly-formed states would be disastrous as it would only be asking for unnecessary and manifold litigation. The entire exercise would be flawed in its very inception.“ Justice Sanjay added: “Merely because lapses have occurred in the implementation of the applicable rules, the authorities should not sleep over such an essential exercise for years together and continue with ad hoc arrangements to the detriment of the officers. The state of Andhra Pradesh and its DGP, being the cadre controlling authorities, would necessarily have to undertake this exercise and rectify the defects in drawing up seniority in the feeder category of inspectors of police (Civil) as notified under G.O.Ms.No.54 dated 22.02.2014 and G.O.Ms.No.115 dated 18.07.2014, and thereafter undertake the exercise of finalizing the seniority of DSPs (Civil), by including direct recruit DSPs also, up to 01.06.2014. Only after completion of this exercise, final allocations can be made.“
 
 In the meanwhile, as tentative allocations have already been effected, the same shall continue pending the finalization of seniority .
