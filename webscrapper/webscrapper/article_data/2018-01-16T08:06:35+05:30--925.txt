GURUGRAM: Students at the Government Girls College, Sector 14, will be able to avail free Wi-Fi on campus in a week’s time. The state education department has partnered with service provider   to install free Wi-Fi in colleges, and the Sector 14 college will be the first to receive this service.

 There are plans to install free Wi-Fi in degree colleges throughout the state, but authorities haven’t given a time-frame for it. The initiative is part of a Reliance Jio target to provide free Wi-Fi to up to three crore college students across the country.
 
 Sandeep Mann, who teaches computers at the college, said, “Hotspots, where students can easily access free Wi-Fi, have been installed. Students will most probably be able to avail the facility in the next few days.”
