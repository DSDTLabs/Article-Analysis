CHANDIGARH: The city’s muchloved   is dead for all practical purposes, said Rajendra  , a noted environmentalist who was in the city to participate in the TOI Environment Conference, 2018.

 Explaining the reasons for such a grim diagnosis of Sukhna’s condition, he said when the water-holding and water-regenerating capacity of a water body or lake is minimised, it is considereddeadin scientificterms.
 
 
 Singh, a well-known conservationist from Alwar, Rajasthan, has worked extensively to revive and regenerate 11 rivers in Rajasthan. The environmentalist,who runs an NGO,‘Tarun Bharat Sangh’, elaborated on the failure of the UT departmentof forest andconservation to understand the fact that the ecology of   Lake is “very sensitive”.
 
 “The catchment area of Sukhna Lake is very sensitive and the department of forest, UT is not able to understand this. There is a reason for its water level going down. Since, it is a man-made lake, the process of connecting it to the environment and restoring it to its former glory is very simple, but we need to understand certain scientific steps to understand its requirements, which will not happen merely through an engineering approach,” Singh said.
 
 He underscored the need for desilting of the lake to increase its water-holding and recharging capacity. “Over time and duetothelackof regular efforts at desilting, silt comes down through erosion. It has been accumulating on the lake bed in large quantities. This should be removed by making 15 to 20 desilting channels inside the lake bed while understanding the mapping of its vertical but confined fractures, along with horizontal but unconfined fractures. This will help lake water seep intotheunderground acufers along with the sub-surface acufers,whichwillhelp thelake to reserve water to be used during dry spells. This is the part of the lake that needs to be sustained. But we have to do it carefully to protect the biodiversity of the lake,” said Singh.
