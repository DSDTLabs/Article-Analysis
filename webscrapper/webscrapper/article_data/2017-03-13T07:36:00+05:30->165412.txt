BILASPUR (MOGA): Residents of this nondescript village located on the Barnala-Moga highway have a reason to smile. Two political leaders hailing from here have been elected to the Punjab assembly on tickets of different parties even as the third one failed to make it.

 All three had contested from reserved assembly constituencies — bureaucrat-turned-politician Ajaib Singh Bhatti contested on Congress ticket from Malout reserve assembly constituency in Muktsar district, Manjit Singh from Nihal Singh Wala reserve assembly constituency in Moga district on AAP ticket and Ajit Singh Shant contested from Mehal Kalan assembly in Barnala district on SAD ticket. Both Bhatti and Manjit Singh won their respective seats while Shant lost.
 
 Two-time MLA Bhatti won by 4,989 votes. He too had won in 2007 from Nathana assembly segment and from Bhucho in 2012. He said that, “The people of Malout have given me mandate to serve them and will do my duty with utmost devotion.”
 
 Manjit, a journalist-turned-politician, won by 27,574 votes. He said that, “I will work untiringly for the people as the area has given me responsibility by making me win with a thumping majority.”
 
 Shant lost by 27,064 votes to Kulwant Singh of AAP. He had won as an independent candidate in 2007 elections from Nihal Singh Wala assembly segment but had lost in 2012 election, then contesting as Congress candidate, to Rajwinder Kaur, who was contesting on SAD ticket. This time Shant had crossed over to SAD.
 
 Earlier, another Bilaspur resident Malkeet Singh Keetu had won twice from Barnala assembly segment in 1997 and 2002 elections but lost in 2007 and 2012 elections. Keetu was killed by his own nephew at his house in the village in 2013.
 
 A villager, Kulwant Singh Kanta, said that, “Bilaspur feels proud in producing many politicians which have joined various parties.” Another local, Makhan Singh said that, “We are hopeful that their voice will be heard in the power corridors.”
