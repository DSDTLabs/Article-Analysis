CHENNAI : If unauthorised illegal constructions are allowed to be regularised, law abiding citizens will also be encouraged to violate law and take advantage of the situation, Madras high court has said, dismissing a review application moved by the owners of a supermarket in  , seeking to regularise unauthorised construction.

 A division bench of   S Vaidyanathan passed the order on the application moved by   and R Jayalakshmi owners of D R Super Market and Furniture Store, situated at Naravarikuppam village, G N T Road, Red Hills seeking to regularise their unauthorised building as per the recommendations of  .
 
 The petitioners contended that as per the   directive, there was no bar for authorities concerned to entertain applications for regularisation of unauthorised construction under Section 113-A of the   and Country Planning Act, 1971.
 
 Recording the submissions, the bench noted that the issue was pending for nearly 18 years, from the date of application for regularisation. Moreover, the Supreme Court had categorically found that even though the cut-off date specified in the relevant Rule, had been periodically extended, the building was not constructed before the cut-off date – March 31, 2002 — as per the Regularisation Rules.
 
 “The deviations and violations have been extracted by this court in its original order dated January 3. The request of the petitioners for regularisation has been duly rejected. The petitioners are trying to take everyone for a ride including this court and the apex court. From the earlier decision of this court, it is clear that there has been alarming and mushrooming growth of unauthorised and illegal constructions which would not have come into place if the state and the authorities concerned have acted diligently and prevented recurrence of such unlawful activities,” the bench said and dismissed the application.
