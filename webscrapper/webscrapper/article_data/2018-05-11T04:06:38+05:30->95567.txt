MUMBAI: Chief Minister   might have announced a December 2019 deadline for commissioning of the Navi Mumbai airport, but top officials from the ministry of civil aviation said on Thursday that the deadline would be "tough to meet." 

 "It would be tough for us to meet the 2019 end deadline for Navi Mumbai, but we're trying," said  , secretary, ministry of civil aviation, who was in the city for a US-India aviation summit hosted by the US Trade and Development Agency. "I haven't met the chief minister during this visit, but I was in Mumbai over a month ago and we discussed the Navi Mumbai airport project," he added.
 
 In March, Fadnavis had reiterated that the   (NMIA) project would be complete next year with one terminal and one runway ready by December end 2019. The idea of having a second airport to serve the Mumbai metropolitan region was first floated in the 1990s. In the past decade, even as domestic passenger traffic in India began registering a robust two-digit growth, the
 state did not put the Navi Mumbai airport project on fast track. Meanwhile, Mumbai airport served by a lone runway is currently so congested it can hardly accommodate new flights during daytime, let alone during the morning or evening peak hours. Choubey also spoke about land pooling for airport projects in the country and the state. “In this concept, land owners are given the option of handing over land for development to the government. The land owner surrenders a part of the land and keeps the remaining, which has a higher value now because it is in a developed area,” he said. 
 
 Speaking about cargo and freighter traffic within India, Choubey said the government has been working on recreating the UDAN scheme. “Airport operators will provide space to cargo operators, we’re looking at how such a scheme can be turned feasible,’’ he said, adding growth in passenger traffic hasn’t brought a corresponding growth in cargo traffic and hence the effort to boost it.
