 "Some people with vested interests are trying to defame the state. They are politicking at the expense of the poor and downtrodden and these anti-development forces are misleading the masses. Certain powers within the state are also trying to keep the state poor," said Das.
 
 He also warned "strict legal action" will be initiated against the divisive forces that hamper development of the state. 
 
 The reaction comes after Bihar   Nitish Kumar on Wednesday criticised Das and his industrial policies at a rally in Morabadi ground here.
 
 Speaking at the state government's ground-breaking ceremony - for 21 memoranda signed during global investors' summit - the CM urged the investors present not to "pay heed to the anti-development forces."
