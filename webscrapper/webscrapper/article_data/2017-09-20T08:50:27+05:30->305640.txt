MUMBAI: Former India and Mumbai left-arm spinner   is set to be the next to face the   bouncer.

 Kulkarni is presently a Mumbai selector, but he may have to soon quit that post, if his company, NSE Events, which is part of a consortium including the Valuable Group and  , becomes the rights holder of the Mumbai Premier League (MPL), which is likely to kick off next January.
 
 Last Thursday, Kulkarni, representing his consortium, made a presentation to top officials of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) about running the MPL, a local Twenty20 tournament. 
 
 “Carlton Saldhana (21st century), IMG-Reliance (which, the   Group, and Nilesh Kulkarni's consortium made their presentations (about organising the MPL). Kulkarni has to leave one thing in case his consortium bags the contract,” an MCA official said on Tuesday .It remains to be seen if Kulkarni decides to quit the consortium or his post as a Mumbai selector.
 
 “IMG-Reliance and the Aditya Birla Group have as ked for more time, and will give a more detailed presentation later. It should be decided in about a week or 10 days,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the iconic Wankhede Stadium, where India recorded its second World Cup triumph in 2011, may soon be rechristened. The more than four-decade old venue, which was named after its 'builder' S K Wankhede (a politician and the president of the Bombay Cricket Association in the 1970s), is likely to have a sponsor's name attached to it.
 
 Last Thursday, three companies -IMG-Reliance, advertising firm DDB Mudra and Baseline gave presentations to the MCA officials about their bid to brand the stadium, with a suffix or prefix attached to it.
