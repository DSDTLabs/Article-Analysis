MELBOURNE: Recalling a run-in with  , former Australia opener   on Friday said he once felt like picking up a stump and stabbing the current India captain after being told something "highly inappropriate".

 India got the better of Australia 2-1 at home in one of the most intense but bitterly-fought series in recent years.
 
 Top-notch cricket aside, the series was marked by one controversy after another with the two captains - Kohli and   - in the eye of a raging storm.
 
 Cowan was quoted as saying by  , "I had a very sick Mum during one of those series and he said something that was inappropriate.
 
 "Why I make the point of 'lost in translation', he said something that was highly inappropriate. A personal matter that was highly sensitive. Highly inappropriate. But he didn't realise that he'd overstepped the mark until the umpire came over and said -- 'Virat that's overstepped the mark' -- and once that was said, he took a step back and apologised.
 
 "But, there was a moment I wanted to pick up the stump and stab him."
 
 The Australians have been targetting Kohli ever since he stopped short of calling Smith a 'cheat' following the DRS drama, involving the visiting skipper, in the second Test at Bengaluru.
 
 Cowan, who scored 1001 runs in 18 Tests with a best of 136, added that he is a big fan of the Indian.
 
 "I'm a huge fan of his cricket. Don't get me wrong he's a phenomenal cricketer.
 
 "I had a little bit of a run-in that was inappropriate when he toured Australia and the umpire had to intervene.
 
 "We forget that English isn't their first language. It's very easy to sit back and say as a player they're barking something at me that is inappropriate when we don't try and converse with them in Hindi."
