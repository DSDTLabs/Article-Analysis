NEW DELHI:   has walked the talk by deciding not to endorse aerated soft drink Pepsi and fairness creams any more. The Indian skipper has said that as he doesn't consume soft drinks or use fairness creams in real life, he does not want to be seen selling these products. His intention is to set the right example for his young fans.

 Explaining Kohli's decision,  , the CEO of   which manages brand Kohli, told TOI on Saturday, “It is not about money here. He didn't want to be a brand ambassador of something which he doesn't use in real life. Kohli knows there are plenty of children who look up to him.
 
 “Therefore, endorsing a soft drink is not on his mind at all. It is his personal decision,” Sajdeh added.
 
 Sajdeh said nothing comes closer to Kohli's heart than a healthy body. “Virat is against junk food and he wants the youngsters to have a healthy lifestyle. He is the perfect brand ambassador. He wants to set the right example,” said Sajdeh, adding that the Indian captain says he won't be part of any project which is not good for the human body .
 
 By refusing to endorse aerated soft drinks or fairness products which relate one's success with skin tone, Kohli has sent out a strong message ­ to other Indian cricketers and sportspersons, and India Inc.
 
 Former India Kapil Dev, one of the first Indian sportspersons to endorse consumer products, expressed his happiness over Kohli's decision. “If I am offered even $10 million dollars today for endorsing such products, I will refuse.During my playing days, I did endorse a soft drink but there wasn't anyone to guide us those days. We were not mature enough to understand such issues,” Kapil told TOI.
 
 When asked if he could see other cricketers following in Kohli's footsteps, Kapil said: “This is a matter of personal choice.” Currently , Kohli charges Rs 4.5 to Rs 5 crore per day for a brand. He endorses 17 brands ­ all carefully chosen keeping in mind his social connect.
