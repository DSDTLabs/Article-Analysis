GURUGRAM: The Class XI student accused of murdering a Class II boy of his school in   last September moved the Punjab and   high court seeking bail on Saturday. 

 On the same day, CBI submitted statements of 127 witnesses before a city court as part of its chargesheet that was submitted earlier this month.
 
 In the chargesheet containing total 29 volumes — the witnesses’ statements being the 29th one — the CBI claimed to have found enough evidence against the juvenile, who was picked up by the agency in November last year for allegedly slitting the throat of the Class II boy on September 8.
 
 The sessions court, which is hearing the case, had earlier rejected the juvenile’s bail plea twice. On Saturday, the court of additional sessions judge JS Kundu began hearing a petition filed by the juvenile’s counsel, challenging the Juvenile Justice Board’s order in December 2017 to treat the juvenile as an adult.
 
 “According to the law, the CBI should have submitted its final report within a month of starting the investigation and on the basis of circumstances and the social investigation report, the board had to conduct a preliminary assessment. But in this case, the board took the decision solely on the basis of the social investigation report,” said advocate  , who appeared on behalf of the juvenile. 
 
 He added the juvenile should have been given an opportunity to defend himself.  , the counsel for the Class II student’s father, said the court had given a number of dates — February 28, March 1, 6, and 9 — to complete hearing on all the applications of the juvenile as early as possible. The other two petitions pending before the court are on the police remand of the juvenile from November 8-11 and the CBI move to collect fingerprints of the juvenile.
