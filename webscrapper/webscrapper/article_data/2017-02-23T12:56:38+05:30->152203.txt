PATNA: Keeping in view of the ugly scene in Tamil Nadu assembly recently,   has planned to introduce a novel system of choosing the ‘best performing legislator’ every day on the basis of the overall performance of the MLAs in the House. The best performing MLA(s) for the day will be identified by a select team of journalists who are acquainted with the assembly’s business rules and have experience of covering House proceedings.

 “I will be happier if more than one member is adjudged the ‘best performing legislator’ on every working day, because it will encourage the members to come to the House well prepared on the subject and other legislative issues. It will promote a healthy competition among the MLAs,” Speaker   told TOI on Wednesday, on the eve of the assembly’s budget session beginning on Thursday.
 
 He said the photographs of all such MLAs would be displayed prominently in the lobby and galleries of the House just like prominent schools display the photographs of their top performers on their boards.
 
 The Speaker said the proposal and procedure for selecting ‘best performing legislator’ was discussed at the assembly’s media advisory committee (MAC) meeting on Tuesday.
 
 “I have requested the MAC’s vice chairperson to constitute a select team of experienced journalists to identify the best legislators on day-to-day basis. Other modalities will be worked out with that team,” Choudhary said.
 
 He said the first day of the budget session would begin with the governor’s address to the joint sitting of both the houses of the state legislature. After that, the assembly session will not be held on February 24, 25 and 26 on account of Mahashivaratri and the weekend. “If everything goes as per discussion at the MAC meeting, the procedure to select the best performing legislator would begin on Monday,” the Speaker said.
