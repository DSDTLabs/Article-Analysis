Gurgaon: The district administration has decided to set up more   collection   at the   border to ease   and streamline   on the expressway.

 At present, there is only one counter at the Sirhaul toll plaza for collecting taxes from thousands of commercial vehicles that enter Gurgaon from Delhi daily. As a result, Gurgaon-bound vehicles have to wait long to get the entry. Further, there is no parking facility at the toll plaza, which forces drivers to park their vehicles on the expresswa.
 
 Gurgaon deputy commissioner (DC) Vinay Pratap Singh, along with RTA secretary Trilok Chand, visited Sirhaul on Monday morning to take stock of the situation. “In order to solve the problems, more counters will be opened and there will be parking facility near the plaza. We are also exploring other options to provide relief to commuters,” the DC added.
