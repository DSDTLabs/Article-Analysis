NEW DELHI: A 16-year-old girl delivered a baby while she was at school in northwest Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar. Police said the girl became pregnant after she was   multiple times by her neighbour, a 51-year-old autorickshaw driver. 

 Police said that the auto driver was arrested on Friday after a case under relevant sections of protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against him at Mukherjee Nagar police station. 
 
 The accused confessed to the crime and disclosed that he had been threatening to kill the girl if she informs anyone about the rape. 
 
 Surprisingly, the girl’s parents, and her teachers and classmates at the school were unaware of her pregnancy, despite her advanced pregnancy of 26 weeks. She had also been suffering from stomach pain from some days. Police said that the girl delivered a premature girl child because Gaffar had given her abortion pills after he learnt that she was pregnant. All this while, the girl’s parents thought that she had acidity. 
 
 A senior police officer said that the incident took place when the girl had gone to sit for a compartment exam at her school. During the examination, the girl developed labour pains. As she complained of stomach pain, the teacher in the classroom asked her to go to the washroom.
 
 Some time later, the girl delivered the baby in the washroom. The teacher informed the school administration who in turn informed the girl’s parents, who had no clue about the pregnancy. The school authorities rushed the girl and her baby to a nearby hospital. The hospital authorities informed the police about the   girl delivering a premature baby.
 
 Milind Dumbere, DCP (northwest) said the minor girl and her daughter was out of danger and stable. The girl told the police that she was raped by her 51-year-old neighbour at least eight times in the last nine months.
