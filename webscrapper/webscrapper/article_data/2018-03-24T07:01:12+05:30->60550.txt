BENGALURU: The deputy director of public instruction (DDPI), Bengaluru South, has launched an internal investigation into allegations of question paper mix-up from at least six exam centres in   on Day 1 of SSLC examination.

 According to sources, at a few centres, fresh candidates were given repeater question papers. The issue came to the notice of authorities 10-15 minutes after the exam began.
 
  in Jayanagar, Sarakki Government School in Sarakki and   were among the affected centres, officials said.
 
 However, Bengaluru South DDPI Ashwatha Narayana Gowda said it wasn’t a major issue. “Generally, there won’t be a major difference in the question papers prepared for fresh and repeater candidates. The difference will be of around 10-15 marks. As the syllabus is same, students will be aware of the answers too. Still, we changed the question papers wherever we came to know of a mix-up. In the remaining places, students will be given the marks. There is nothing to worry about,” he said.
 
 Gowda said affected students were given extra time to compensate for the time lost due to the confusion.
 
 D  , general secretary, Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) said: “We got to know of the mix-up only when children came out of the exam hall. It’s a serious issue and it has affected several students.”
