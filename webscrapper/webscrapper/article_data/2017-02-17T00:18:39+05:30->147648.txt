Ganesan’s black Yamaha motorcycle still stands outside his Kidwai Nagar home, a poignant memorial, chained and unused for a dozen years now. "There was no question of selling it," says Mukesh Kumar, the younger brother of the 29-year-old whose body was never recovered after the explosion at Sarojini Nagar Market. Police had found Ganesan’s bike 500 metres from the blast site, but DNA tests and investigations over several years never identified his body. 

 The cheery Ganesan, a casual worker in the Cabinet Secretariat, had gone to Sarojini Nagar Market with his mother, Pelaniammal, to pick up clothes from a tailor. On the way home, some friends called him. "He put amma in an autorickshaw near Nauroji Nagar," says Mukesh, who was nine at the time of the incident. "He took Rs 50 from her for petrol and said he would come back after five minutes." Ganesan never returned home.
 
 Father K Sengodan, a government employee, never stopped looking for his son. "My father frequented police stations, courts and temples. He went to south India and to the east looking for his son," Mukesh narrates. "But the shock left him weak and a heart attack in 2013 consumed him." Grief sucked the joy out of mother Pelaniammal’s life too. "We have never celebrated any festivals or other occasions," says Mukesh.
 
 The family got Rs 8 lakh as compensation only in 2015. "We had to spend over Rs 1 lakh in pursuing the money in the courts," discloses Mukesh. The amount, he says, is now saved in a fixed deposit to be used for the marriage of the younger sister.
 
 None of the family members has ever gone back to Sarojini Nagar Market. "For us, it is still   in that market and it pains us to be there," says Mukesh. The lingering trauma is why the family had wanted the perpetrators to be hanged. "Their story must end, imprisonment won’t achieve anything," Mukesh had said. "No other innocent person should die due to their handiwork."
