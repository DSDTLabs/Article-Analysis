CHENNAI: In a setback to former Union minister P Chidambaram’s wife, son and daughter-in-law, the   on Thursday refused to restrain the income tax department from filing cases against them in a money laundering case. 

 The issue pertains to notices issued by the I-T department to Nalini Chidambaram,   Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 for alleged non-disclosure of overseas properties and bank accounts.
 
 Claiming that they have duly disclosed all the details of such properties and bank accounts in foreign countries in their returns, they alleged the department has initiated such proceedings only to harass and humiliate them.
 
 They sought the court to prohibit the department from starting prosecution proceedings against them before the special court for economic offences or any other appropriate court.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing before Justice T S Sivagnanam, counsel for the I-T department opposed the plea saying the department has initiated the proceedings based on information provided by the CBI.
 
 To this, the judge said the petitioners are ready to cooperate with the inquiry, but they apprehend sanctioning of prosecution.
 
 The I-T department’s counsel said, “Issuing notice under the Black Money Act and sanctioning prosecution are entirely two different aspects. The department can sanction prosecution notwithstanding pending inquiry on assessment. The Act does not prohibit the department from doing so.”
 
 According to the I-T department, Nalini, Karti and Srinidhi have failed to disclose a property they jointly own in Cambridge, in the UK. 
 
 Apart from this, the department has alleged that Karti had failed to disclose an overseas bank account he holds with Metro Bank in UK and investments he had made in Nano Holdings LLC, USA.
