JALANDHAR: Sant Nirmal Dass, head of the Sri Guru Ravidass Sadhu Sampardai Society in   district -having a large number of Dalit followers in Punjab - didn't go for the   event at the headquarters in Nagpur on Saturday, citing health reasons.

 Sources, however, said that he had stayed away after members of the society strongly opposed his attending the RSS event. The invite to Nirmal Dass was being seen as a ma jor step by RSS to extend respect to a Dalit religious leader, and part of its strategy to reach out to the SC community. Ravidassia Adidharmi community has a strong presence in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and a few other states.
 
 Sources said some sections within the Society and even some followers, including NRIs, were not in favour of Nirmal Dass's visit to the RSS headquarters, as they were upset with the Sangh's handling of issues related to Dalits.He returned from Delhi on Friday night, sources said.
 
 When contacted on Satur day , Sant Nirmal Dass said, “I am not well and had to turn back.“ Sources said his attending the event could have triggered a split in Society , which has over 300 members, who head different deras across Punjab. Some officebearers also held a meeting at   village near Phagwara on Friday and decided to oppose his proposed visit to the RSS headquarters.
