Actor   got a taste of what heaven looks like, when wife Amal Sufiya gave birth to the bundle of Joy Maryam Ameerah Salmaan. It is said that time flies, and in his case, it sure did, as it has been an year already since she was born!

 When the baby was born last year, Dulquer had acknowledged her as a ‘drop of heaven’, which we are sure would be every parent’s reaction when he or she witnesses the presence of a newborn in their lives.
