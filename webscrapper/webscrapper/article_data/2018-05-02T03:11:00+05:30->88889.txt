Margao: The growing demand for the reopening of the Margao branch office of the government   press has so far failed to spur the authorities concerned into action. While the branch office and sales counter that was functioning from the Comunidade building in Margao has been closed since the last three years, the space allotted to it at the Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex, Margao, is yet to become functional. 

 The closure of the Margao counter is greatly inconveniencing consumers from the South Goa district who wish to purchase printed copies of various acts, rules, the official gazettes or pay subscription fees. Consumers, especially those hailing from the far-fetched areas of Sanguem, Canacona and Dharbandora talukas are compelled to visit the sales counter in Panaji, thereby expending their valuable time and money.
 
 With the Margao counter closed, the Panaji counter is the only outlet now that caters to the entire state. Moreover, it was from the Margao branch office that stationery, standard forms and registers were supplied to various government departments and offices in South Goa.
