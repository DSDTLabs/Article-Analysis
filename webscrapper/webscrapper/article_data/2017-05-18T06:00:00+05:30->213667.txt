We have started work on phase one on 250 acres. We will be laying the approach road and internal roads along with the streetlights and drains. The estimated cost is around Rs 20 crore,” an APIIC official said. He said the total plotted area is around 150 acres and the remaining 100 acres will be a common green area for layiout. “We are expecting around 30 plots to be developed in the 150 acres,” he said.
 
 APIIC sources said the size of the plots will vary from one acre to five acres. Also, an area is being earmarked for commercial activities to cater to the IT layout. The IT layout is being developed as part of the state government’s plans to attract IT and ITeS companies to the port city. Sources said the development work is likely to take around one year to be completed. “There are several small and medium IT companies, which have already set up operations in the port city. There is already a demand for office space for IT and ITeS for which we have identified some space in the core city area. In addition to this, we want to develop the IT layout so that more companies look at expanding their operations in Vizag,” said an IT department official.
