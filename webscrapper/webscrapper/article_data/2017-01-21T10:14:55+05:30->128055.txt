NAGPUR: The sessions court on Friday granted bail to the dean of   and Hospital (IGMCH) Dr   (Wahane).

 She had surrendered to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Wednesday afternoon. She has been charged with relevant sections under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Dr Gajbhiye is accused of allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs15, 000 for clearing bills of a medicine supplier.
 
 Public prosecutor   pleaded that the accused should not be granted bail as she could tamper with the evidence. But the court granted bail to Dr Gajbhiye on a surety of Rs25,000. She has also been asked to report to the police station every Monday and Thursday between 11am and 3pm.
 
 Defence lawyer advocate Y P Mandpe told TOI that Dr Gajbhiye had herself surrendered to the ACB and there was no question of her absconding as reported by a certain section of media, raising doubts about her integrity.
 
 Clarifying about clearing of medicine bills by the dean, Mandpe said the investigating team had not seized the bills yet. Also, there were no possibilities of her clearing the bills as a dean as these are cleared by the purchase committee and administrative officer of the college. The bills were still in the outward-inward section.
 
 In the meantime, the proposal for her suspension was cleared by state medical education minister   and had reached the office of chief minister   by afternoon. However, the CM was yet to sign the order till late evening. “I have signed the suspension today. Now, I am in Jalgaon. The CM is likely to sign the order soon,” Mahajan told TOI.
