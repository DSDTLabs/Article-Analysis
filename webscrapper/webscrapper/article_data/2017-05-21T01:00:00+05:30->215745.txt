 Bachchan has done it. And so has  . And, now   will also be playing a princess in a period drama. The actress unveiled the first look of her upcoming trilingual film, 'Sanghamitra', at the ongoing Cannes film festival on the French Riviera. While the film is yet to go on floors,   revealed why she jumped at the opportunity of doing a period film. She says, “A period saga is the biggest film in any actor’s career. Physical preparation and training in martial arts is a must for my role. Also,   is an extremely strong character. It’s the kind of role every actress would like to play. One rarely chances upon such opportunities. I can’t wait to see the movie come to life. ” That’s not all, in her first brush with a rom com in Hindi cinema, Shruti will be essaying the role of a small town girl. “I really loved the story. My character is loosely based on the director’s sister. So, I had a real-life reference. She is feminine, vulnerable and still tomboyish. Small-town girls are quite tough. I feel closest to her among all the characters I have played,” she signs off.
