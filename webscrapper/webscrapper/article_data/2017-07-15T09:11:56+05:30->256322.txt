ERODE: Five persons were arrested on Friday for hunting down a spotted deer in the reserve forest area in K N Palayam a few days ago. They were, however, let off with a fine and a stern warning not to commit the crime again.

 During a vehicle check at K N Palayam forest check post on Friday early morning, forest officials attached to Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) found a man carrying meat on his bike. The team, led by forest officer G  , grilled A Kenjaiyan, 30, and he told them it was spotted deer’s meat.
 
 “He, along with four others, killed the deer on Tuesday and ate the meat. Kenjaiyan also dried some meat, which he was carrying on the bike. The meat weighed around half-a-kilo,” Johnson said. Kenjaiyan was arrested based on his confessional statement.
 
 The officials also nabbed four of his accomplices. They were identified as M Markannan, 63, R Muthusamy, 30, K  , 42 and S Sathiesh, 35, who also confessed to the crime.
 
 The forest officials fined them Rs 50,000 each and released them with a warning. “We will arrest them if they commit the same crime in future,” Johnson added.
