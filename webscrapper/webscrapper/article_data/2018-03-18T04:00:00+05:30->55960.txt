Vadodara: Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III not only gifted a magnanimous court building to the city, but he also ensured that the Baroda state got a commendable justice system. The system put in place ensured that justice was delivered within a stipulated time and there was no delay.

 Way back in 1904, Sayajirao had delinked justice and establishment. This had led to more trust in the judiciary. The reason being that if those in power were also the ones doing justice, there were chances of justice not being done.
 
 Bansidhar Sharma in his book ‘Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III – Vyaktitva and Krutitvani Sankshipt Jhalak’ states that the reform of de-linking administration and justice was also appreciated by Lord Chelmsford, the then viceroy of India. Before this, Sayajirao had even formed a law committee to draft laws for the state.
 
 The great grandnephew of Sayajirao, Jitendrasinh Gaekwad said that Sayajirao’s brothers Senapati Anandrao Gaekwad and his brother Colonel Sampatrao Gaekwad, who was also a barrister, had also contributed to the legal system.
 
 “Sayajirao used to believe that mere investments in infrastructure was not enough. He invested heavily in human capital and had the best of judges, lawyers and court staff on rolls. A deadline was set for delivering justice and the same judge used to hear a case till it was decided,” said Jitendrasinh. He added that the longest heard case was of a dacoit and justice was done in the case in 273 days.
 
 Jitendrasinh pointed out that here were separate courts for women so that they could approach he system without any reluctance or fear. He added that when the Baroda state merged into India and the judicial system was handed over, there were no pending cases.
