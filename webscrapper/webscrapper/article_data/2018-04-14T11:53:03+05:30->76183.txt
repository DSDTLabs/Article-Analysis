TRICHY: More than Rs 3.5 lakh cash and six pounds of gold jewellery were allegedly stolen from a house in   on Thursday. It has been said that the cash and the jewellery belonged to a doctor, Ilansekaran.

 The doctor was staying at his uncle Kalai’s apartment at Mannargudi for some time. On Thursday, the doctor discovered that the suitcase in which he had kept the cash, jewellery and a few documents was missing from the bureau of his uncle’s house.
 
 Initially it was presumed that since renovation works were going on in the apartment building, some unidentified members might have entered and stolen it. It was further guessed that the men might have climbed to Kalai’s balcony through scaffolding, which was erected for the renovation work. The balcony was also apparently not locked.
 
 On Friday, Ilansekaran gave a complaint at the   police station. The police said that they were yet to confirm who committed the robbery and were yet to know how it took place.
