CHANDIGARH: A   of   (CAT) dismissed plea of 10 income tax inspectors, who had challenged the promotions and seniority orders of their department. 

 The inspectors had challenged the office order dated May 26, 2017 that rejected claim for re-fixing of seniority and promotion by giving them benefits of earlier service rendered under earlier region, and to quash the seniority list dated August 21, 2015. In their plea, the inspectors had sought directions to place them at par with their batch mates.
 
 The applicants, who were directly recruited as inspectors through combined graduate level examination, initially joined at different regions between 2011 and 2013. 
 
 Later, they applied for inter-charge transfer to chief commissioner of income-tax, Chandigarh, in north western region (NWR) on different dates. 
 
 When they were not assigned seniority and benefit of their earlier service, they submitted various representations on May 14, 1990.
 
 The tribunal observed that the competent authority while passing order specifically indicated conditions, which were in consonance with   circular that they will lose seniority in the new region and will be given bottom seniority.
