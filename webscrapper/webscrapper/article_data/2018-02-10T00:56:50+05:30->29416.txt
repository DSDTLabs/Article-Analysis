Activists allege that many such hoarding have come up on the forest area especially along the stretch granted to MSRDC by the forest department.

 Khopoli social activist Gurunath Sathelkar said, “Large number of hoardings have been erected on the E-way side. A team usually turn up at nights or on holidays to erect the hoarding stand. Later, a banner wishing a local leader on his birthday appears on it. The MSRDC and forest officials hjave failed to take action.”
 
 Khalapur range forest office forester   said, “Our team has caught a group of labourers erecting an illegal hoarding on Friday morning at HOC Bridge. We have seized the machines from the spot. Further investigation is on. MSRDC has not been permitted to install the hoarding.”
 
 Khalapur range forest officer Ashish Patil said, “Only three hoardings have obtained our permission. The erection work has been stalled.” Another activist Sekhar Jambhale said, “Illegal hoardings in the forest area should be curbed.”
 
 Deputy conservator of forest, Alibaug Maneesh Kumar said, “The hoardings may have been installed on the right of way area given to MSRDC.” Superintendent engineer, MSRDC, P S Auti said, “We do not have exact data on the number of hoardings on the E-way side.”
