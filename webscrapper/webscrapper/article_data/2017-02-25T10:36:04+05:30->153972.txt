BHOPAL:   Commission ( ) has issued a notice to   (BMC) commissioner asking why CCTV cameras in a low-floor bus, in which a commuter was murdered on February 21, were out of order. Pickpockets murdered a youth in crowded Royal Market area.

 The commission also sought the number of buses which have CCTV cameras, but are not in a working condition.
 
 Similarly, the commission asked DIG, Bhopal, when police got information of incident and the time it took took cops to reach the spot. 
 
 Taking cognisance of murder in moving low-floor bus, the commission asked officials to send a report at the earliest.
 
 The murder made every commuter shudder because it’s one thing to be pickpocketed, but quite another if thieves are willing to stick a knife into you for a few hundred rupees barely a hundred metres from a police station.
 
 What makes the murder even more tragic is the victim, 25-year-old Kamal Singh, was on his way to the chief minister’s house to seek aid for his ailing baby and boarded the wrong bus.
 
 Despite the bus being crowded, police said not a single person on the bus was willing to to give a statement. There are no suspects. And the CCTV camera in the bus was not working, police said.
 
 Kamal lived with his family in Tanda Berasia locality of Gunga on Bhopal’s outskirts. He and his brother-in-law Himmat Singh came to the city on a bike on Tuesday and parked it near LMB Hospital to take the bus to the CM’s house. Police managed to arrest two accused in the case.
