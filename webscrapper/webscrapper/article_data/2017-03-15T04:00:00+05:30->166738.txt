 Top brokers and fund managers feel that the UP election win will give the   confidence to push ahead with its reforms agenda more forcefully than before. The UP state assembly results will prompt the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre to prepare for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections more confidently, said Motilal Oswal, CMD,  . “This number will help BJP consolidate its position in Rajya Sabha as well. We think this momentum is here to stay and we are on the cusp of a positive inflection point of earnings for a long-term market rally,” he said.
 
 Other leading brokerages are also positive on the BJP’s state poll showing, leading to a pickup in the reforms initiative of the Central government, which includes improving social agenda and rural sectors, and also pushing ahead with reforms in areas of land, labour and taxation.
