NAGPUR: Railway Protection Force (RPF) teams of South East   (SECR) and Central Railway (CR) conducted joint raids at four spots in Khamla and nabbed a travel agent red-handed while selling premium tatkal tickets at higher prices through several private accounts on IRCTC website. 

 The raids, a part of the RPF drive against illegal sale of railway e-tickets in city, were conducted following a tip-off by divisional security commissioner (DSC)  , under the guidance of senior DSC CR  . This is the third consecutive successful action by the RPF over the last one week. 
 
 Around 75 tickets, including nine live tickets, bought in the last one month and material, total worth almost Rs3.76 lakh were seized. RPF found around 20 fake IRCTC IDs and cancelled the live tickets. Jitendra Waswani, 33, manager of Shree Ram Tours and Travels in Khamla was arrested on Tuesday afternoon. 
 
 Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Satija said, “The agent used fake IRCTC accounts to buy a number of premium and tatkal tickets which would be later sold at higher prices. The agents already had an IRCTC account, still they used fake accounts to earn more profit.”
 
 The RPF is going through the data from three computers that were seized. Pandey said, “More raids will be conducted as it seems to be a massive racket running into crores.” Officials are also planning to rope in IT experts to recover the data which the agents had deleted every one month.
 
 “No official, either from RPF or railways, will be spared if they are found be having links to the racket,” said Satija.
 
 It is learnt, the agents use software to auto-fill forms while applying for tatkal tickets and also use bank accounts which do not send OTPs to confirm payments. 
 
 It ensures that the agent get the ticket quickly than others applying for the same tickets.
