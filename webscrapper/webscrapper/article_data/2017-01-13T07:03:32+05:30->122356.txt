JAIPUR: In a surprise inspection conducted by mayor   on Thursday morning, nearly 85%   (JMC) officials were found absent from work.

 The inspection was carried out at 9.45 am where majority of officials were not found in their office. According to official sources, mayor summoned chief executive officer (CEO)   in his office and directed to mark half-day for officials who had come late. 
 
 “The official reporting time at JMC is 9.30 am. However, majority of officials and staff members were late. The mayor also checked the attendance resister and he was surprised to witness that 15% attendance was marked,” said a official source.
 
 Having failed to enforce staff attendance over many years, the JMC had earlier installed   across its zonal offices and its head office at   in 2011.
 
 Following this , officials reportedly came to office on time . However, as administration failed to upkeep and maintain the machines, the officials again started coming late to office. Now, there is no improvement in the JMC’s functioning as it is difficult for administration to detect late comers. “In 2011, after the biometric system was put in place at the JMC's head office at Lal Kothi, the all employees were asked to record attendance twice a day, including the CEO, deputy mayor's staff and all zonal commissioners. This has improved the system,” source said.
