HYDERABAD: Preparing for a heatwave condition or severe rainfall in their area might soon become easier for Hyderabadis. This, with the   ( ) proposing to set up an additional 120 automatic weather stations (AWS) at various locations within the   ( ) limits.
 
 At present, the GHMC area has just about 32 AWS.
 
 Announcing this on Saturday at a one-day workshop on extreme weather conditions in Telangana,  , chief executive officer of TSDPS said the move will help authorities record weather readings accurately and disseminate information at the micro-level quicker.
 
 “The existing AWS registers readings up to a 10-square km radius. Increase in number of AWS will drastically reduce the radius to 2.5 square km,” said Shaik Meera, highlighting how this will also help authorities mitigate the impact of weather conditions across the city. Stressing the need for accuracy, climate change experts said that the poor preparedness of agencies, at present, to tackle issues such as heatwave casualties and urban flooding is primarily due to lack of precise data on climate change.
 
 
 “Higher number of AWS will not only generate more data but also help meteorologists analyse it better. Variability, severity of rainfall and temperature at different locations at a given time can be predicted more efficiently if there is more data. This will help officials issue faster warnings and forecast to people, while allowing government officials to draw better plans to tackle climate change,” said Y V  , meteorologist at TSDPS.
