PUNE: A special squad will check   (PMPML) buses operating during the night time to prevent cases of passengers being illtreated.

 
  
 The move comes after a family, including women, faced harassment and humiliation from the conductor and driver while they were travelling by one of the night buses from Swargate to   , recently.
 
 “The special squad comprising three officials will move along the routes of the night buses. They will be at the bus stops and ask passengers about their experience while travelling and whether the driver or conductor behaved well with them,” an official told TOI.
 
 He added that the team will also check if women have seats in the buses.“The seats on the left side of the buses are reserved for women.   have been told to be strict about it. Action will be taken against those who do not implement the rule. It will be a salary cut and suspension. Even if there are no women in a bus, the seats have to be kept vacant. The team will check this. We will soon put up notices in all the buses,” the official said.
 
 At present, there are six late-night buses plying on six routes from 10pm to 5am.
 
 “The team has a jeep to travel by and track the buses. A separate helpline number will also be announced for these buses. The team can also stop a bus during its journey to check. We believe that this will act as a deterrent,” the official said.
