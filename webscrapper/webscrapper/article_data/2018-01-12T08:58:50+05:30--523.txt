MARGAO: Chief officer of  , Johnson  , on Thursday wrote to the   asking it to expedite the construction of the overhead water tank proposed to be built at a place identified by the   for the purpose of fire fighting.

 Most administrative approvals for the project have already been obtained, Fernandes stated in the letter. He has questioned the delay by the PWD in starting the project. There has been a spate of fire incidents in the city that has made it all the more necessary for the construction of an overhead tank for firefighting purpose, Fernandes said.
 
 The proposal of constructing an overhead water tank of 25,000 cu litre capacity has been lying in limbo for the last several years. While the MMC had initially identified land near the old fish market for the purpose, an alternative at the Gandhi market was later identified after the old fish market site was earmarked for a multi-level pay parking project by the MMC.
