After donning the cap of a choreographer, actor and director,   has now turned lyricist. The actor, who is presently working on the film  , has penned a fun number for the film. Talking about it, composer   says, “Prabhdheva sir has written the introduction song, titled Ayyanaaru Vandhutaanga Inga Paaru, which talks about three people coming back to India from China. I composed the tune and played it to him. He said he will pen down something as a first copy. He was walking up and down in his guest house. I was thinking he will break into a step for the song, but he wrote the song in 15 minutes flat. It came out very well, so we decided to finalise his lines for the song, and got Shankar Mahadevan to sing the number.”

 Presently, the team is shooting this song in Kumbakonam with over 150 dancers. Interestingly, this Prabhudheva number is being choreographed by Sridhar. The film directed by MS  , also has   as the 
 female lead.
