Actress   has praised   for his subtle performance in ' '. 

 The 26-year-old actress - who plays Belle in the new live-action version of the fairytale - has heaped praise on her co-star for his portrayal of LeFou, Disney's first openly gay character. 
 
  
  
 "I think that's what's so fantastic about Josh's performance is that it's so subtle. It's always like, 'Does he idolise  ? Is he in love with Gaston? What's the relationship there?'" Watson says. 
 
 "I think it's incredibly subtle, to be perfectly honest. I don't want people going into this movie thinking there's a huge narrative there."
