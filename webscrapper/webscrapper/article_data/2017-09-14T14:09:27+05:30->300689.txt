AURANGABAD: The   (SCR) has decided to closely look into issues impacting the cleanliness in trains and at stations. Proper hygiene on trains has a lot to do with the proper use of toilets.

 Keeping the hygiene factor in mind, the SCR has appealed the passengers to not use toilets when the train halts at the railway station. 
 
 In the latest public appeal, the SCR has highlighted that the use of train toilets at station halts leads to very unhygienic, dirty and stinking ambiance causing inconvenience to scores of rail passengers waiting at the platforms. 
 
 “While awareness has been increased among a section of passengers about not using toilets when trains are halted at stations, several passengers are still not aware about a range of ill effects of such highly objectionable practice. Such unmindful act has been largely impacting the cleanliness on trains,” a SCR official said. 
 
 SCR has brought to the notice of rail users that littering at the railway station premises and inside trains is an offence and is punishable under the railways act of 1989.
 
 As per the provisions of the law, the station master, station managers and other authorised officers can be slapped with fine of Rs 500. 
 
 As many as 1,719 people were booked for littering at the railway premises and inside trains. Over Rs 4 lakh as fine was collected during the recent fortnight-long cleanliness drive that was carried out across the SCR region in the month of August. 
 
 “In a move towards keeping cleanliness in trains and station premises, SCR has initiated a continuous drive to keep a check on rail users indulging in unhygenic activities. The rail users are involved as an important stakeholders to ensure that the rail journey is clean and comfortable for the passengers,” another SCR official said.
