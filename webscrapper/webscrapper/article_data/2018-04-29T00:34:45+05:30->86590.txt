Cuddalore: Infighting within the Cuddalore district unit of the ruling   party came to the fore after two MPs and three MLAs from the district boycotted a government function presided by ministers M C   and Kadambur C Raju on Saturday.

 The MPs - M Chandrakasi and A Arunmozhidevan and MLAs - P Sathya (Panruti), K A Pandian (Chidambaram) and N Murugamaran (Kattumannarkoil) boycotted the government   to register their strong protest against Sampath, who is also the Cuddalore district secretary of the party.
 
 They have been openly criticising Sampath for ignoring their demands and sidelining their constituencies. Their confrontation began after the   reportedly sidelined them in party affairs and accorded priority to his relatives and supporters. The disgruntled group have been demanding his immediate removal and boycotting government functions presided by the minister in the recent past. TNN
