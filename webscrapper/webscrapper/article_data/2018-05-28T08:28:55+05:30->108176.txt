JANDIALA: Thatheras (copper and brass utensil makers ) of  , near Amritsar, received a pleasant surprise on Sunday when cricketer turned politician Navjot Singh   visited them and announced a corpus fund of Rs 10 lakh to revive their dying craft. The traditional   has made it to UNESCO’s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH).

 Accompanied by deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha and director, Punjab tourism Dhiv Duller Singh, Sidhu walked through the winding lanes in the traditional bazaars of Jandiala, where thatheras have been making brass and copper metal sheets for home and langar (community kitchen), using traditional tools and techniques handed down the generations. 
 
 Sidhu told accompanying reporters that he had announced a corpus fund of Rs 10 lakh for the artisans and would also provide them a shop in Jandiala to showcase their utensils. The craft traces its roots back 150 years. The thatheras’ settlement was established by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In the early 1940s, over 500 families were in the business of making utensils. Now their number has dwindled to just 25. Sidhu said the craft would be showcased at the international level and efforts would be made to strengthen their business. 
 
 The district administration and   are jointly working for the uplift of underprivileged communities through different social entrepreneurship projects. Addressing the gathering, Sangha said due to low income resulting from competition from aluminium products and low cost factory made utensils, it has become an increasingly difficult for thatheras to earn well from this craft. Over the decades, the number of families involved in this traditional craft/profession has fallen.
