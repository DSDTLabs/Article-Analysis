CHENNAI:   has amended a rule that will now benefit students going on exchange   and those migrating from other universities.

 Earlier, undergraduate or postgraduate students who had joined University of Madras after a semester or two in other varsities were not given proper classification (first, second or third classes) in the degree certificate or a cumulative grade point average ( ) officially, as there was no comparison between institutions. They were merely declared to have passed or failed.
 
 On Saturday , the university's academic council decided to use marks awarded in the previous institution, compute the average mark and assign a class and grade.
 
 These students, however, will not be eligible for ranks and prizes as the courses are not comparable. “Not mentioning the class or CGPA in the degree certificate affects the job prospects of students as many employers demand a first class as a pre-requisite during hiring, “ vice-chancellor P   told TOI. “ Also, for a student to get into research, 55% or an equivalent CGPA is necessary at the master's level. So students were affected".
 
 Each year, university officials say, hundreds of students go to foreign universities for a semester or two, while many migrate from autonomous colleges to nonautonomous colleges.
 
 “In the globalised world, student mobility is promoted in universities and countries across the world.Students should be given an opportunity for such exposure and gain knowledge, “ Duraisamy said at the academic council meet.
 
 “Toward this objective, we plan to change our regulation to include classification for those students. However, grades and marks are not comparable across institutions, hence rank will not be given, “ he said .
