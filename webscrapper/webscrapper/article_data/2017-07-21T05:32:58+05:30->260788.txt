MUMBAI: A Sakinaka resident became the latest victim of of a   when Rs 40,000 was used from his bank account to make online shopping payments on Tuesday. A fake 'bank tele-caller', on the pretext of resolving a banking problem that the complainant, BEST employee Netaji Nanote (56), had been facing, made at least 25 calls to get 19 one-time password (OTP) which were sent to his mobile phone. 

 Four days ago, Nanote had raised a complaint with his bank that he was not receiving transaction alerts on his phone and had asked the bank to activate the facility. The fraudster convinced Nanote that a 6-digit number was sent to his phone to resolve his complaint to the bank for not getting bank transaction alerts. 
 
 Nanote, a security guard, learnt about the 18 fraudulent transactions only when he visited the bank on Tuesday to check the progress of his complaint. 
 
 An officer from Sakinaka police station said that the fraudster had managed to get hold of Nanote's card details like 16-digit debit card number, CVV number, expiry date to make online shopping payments. "The fraudster shopped at least 18 times within an hour. The fraudster had got hold of Nanote's confidential bank details after convincing him to update the card so that he would receive transaction alert requests," said the officer.
 
 Nanote's police complaint states: "The caller identified himself as a 'bank telecaller' and convinced me to share the 6-digit number text message. I was furious at having to attend 25 calls and shared the 6-digit numbers at least 19 times. I later realized it is a one-time password required to complete the payment mode online." 
 
 Nanote said that until then he did not suspect the caller as he had already complained about not receiving transaction alerts.
