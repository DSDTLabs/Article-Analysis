KOLHAPUR: The state archaeological department of Maharashtra will hear objections over the primary notification of declaration of Mahalaxmi temple as a state protected monument by priest   and   of Dattatray Devmath Sansthan on May 22.

 The government of Maharashtra had published the notification in March 2016.
 
 The applicant, priest Gajanan Munishwar, has raised objections over the ownership of the temple.“As per the primary notification to declare Mahalaxmi temple as a protected monument, the   (PMDS) has been presented as the owner of the temple, against which I have voiced my discontet. The temple belongs to goddess Ambabai alias Mahalaxmi and the PMDS cannot claim ownership of the temple. I have raised an issue with the Maharashtra State Department of Archaeology and the hearing is slated to take place on May 22.
 
 The assistant director of state archaeological department of Maharashtra, Pune division,  , said, “The state protected monument status is an advantage as it helps in maintaining the historical status of the structure and protects it from any kind of encroachment. Monuments can get funds for restoration and conservation. No one can change the existing architectural status of the monument without the permission of archaeological department. The applicant has raised objection at the directorate-level.”
