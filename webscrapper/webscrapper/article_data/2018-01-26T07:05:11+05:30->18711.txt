HYDERABAD: A   leader,  , husband of municipal chairperson  , was brutally murdered in   town in the intervening night of January 24-25 near his   home. The body was found dumped in an open drain. The murder shocked Congress cadre in town and prompted them to stage a sit-in. Nalgonda police superintendent D V Srinivas Rao told TOI the suspects had been identified and special teams formed to nab them. "The suspects are on the run," he said.

  Komatireddy Venkat Reddy alleged an MLA of the ruling party was behind the murder. He said the MLA summoned Boddupalli Srinivas and demanded he switch parties and join TRS. He also alleged the TRS MLA warned him if he did not do his bidding, he would face consequences. "Even my life is in danger," Komatireddy said.
 
 The victim's wife B Laxmi said they approached police for security cover to her husband. "Security was not provided. We also asked for weapons licences for our own security, but this too was not given," she alleged. Both Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and Laxmi said police were hand in glove with the ruling TRS to eliminate them.
 
 Throughout the day on January 24, Srinivas, an associate of MLA Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, was with him on a tour of the constituency. 
 
 According to family members and police accounts, around 11.30 pm, he got a call from somebody he knew. He went out ostensibly to settle a dispute. A local corporator too tried to settle the issue, but when it could not be done, Boddupalli Srinivas' help was sought. An argument ensued at a 'mirchi bandi' and Srinivas was murdered. Boulders were hurled on him. There were injuries on his eyes too. The body was found dumped in a nala. It is learnt that seven people were present with him at the time of the incident. Though police have not confirmed, some of them are in cop custody.
