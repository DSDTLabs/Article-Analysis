MUMBAI: On January 1, 2019, around noon (IST), Nasa’s  , which had notched up a significant milestone with the   encounter on July 14, 2015, will open a new chapter in celestial history by flying past an   in the  , called  , and collect data that will throw light on the early formation of the  . 

 Henry Throop of the New Horizons science team made this announcement on Saturday, while addressing a meeting of the newly formed Space Geeks Mumbai, which focuses on space and astronomy, at an Andheri pub.
 
 New Horizons, the fastest spacecraft ever to be flown by  , will fly about three times closer to MU69 than it did to Pluto in July 2015, said Throop. “As the object is small, it makes the planning of the flyby tricky. The close-up observation is expected to last for six hours,” he added.
 
 As of Sunday there are 226 days left for the much-awaited flyby, which will be the most distant in the history of space exploration, as MU69 is a billion miles beyond Pluto. 
 
 MU69 was spotted by Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope in 2014, said Throop . “In July 2017, it was observed by astronomers from South Africa and Argentina,” he added. On March 13, 2018, MU69 was christened Ultima Thule.
 
 New Horizons is in a state of hibernation until June 4, 2018. Nasa stated that after the wake-up and a check of the spacecraft’s systems and instruments, the initial phase of the MU69 encounter will begin in mid-August. According to a report in the US Planetary Society, the actual approach phase to MU69 by New Horizons will begin on August 16 and run through December 24, and the first image will be transmsitted around August 21. Throop said New Horizons is expected to exit the Kuiper Belt in 2100.
