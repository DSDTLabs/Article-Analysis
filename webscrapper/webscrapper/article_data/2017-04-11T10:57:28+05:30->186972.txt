PUNE:   doesn't believe in hiding his emotions. The world No. 1 T20 bowler has no qualms in admitting that he was hurt when he went unsold at the   auction this year. And when he got an opportunity through  , he wanted to make the most of it.

 After spending two seasons for  , South African Tahir was released by the team ahead of this season. On Tuesday, the spinner intends to pose a few questions in the middle when Pune play his former team at the   in Gahunje.
 
 "If I say I was okay (at being unsold), I will be lying. I am human at the end of the day. I was sad when the auction happened, the last two years I have been performing. And it's not me saying that, the stats that are saying that," Tahir said during a press conference on Monday. "I left my family back and came here. I can't become more serious than that. So, if I left them, then I am here to do my job. It's not that I am here to prove something. I wanted to be here to challenge and see as to what was the reason for me not being picked.
 
 "For me, life moves on."
 
 The leg-spinner came to Pune as a replacement of Australia's  . After two games and five wickets, Tahir shares the top wicket-takers' spot with Afghanistan leggie Rashid Khan.
 
 When asked how he managed to take wickets on tracks that didn't offer much turn, the South Africa international said he is used to such conditions. "I have never had spinning tracks. So that really helps me (on non-turning tracks). So yeah, take a learning from there. It will be nice if it spins, that's what I have been waiting for a long time," Tahir, 35, said.
 
 He also shared credit of his success with South Africa technical strategy analyst Prasanna Agoram.
 
 Agoram hails from Chennai and is also associated with the Pune IPL team. "I sit with our computer guy Prasanna.He tells me about my feel and everything, he gives me plans, keeps working hard for me," said Tahir.
