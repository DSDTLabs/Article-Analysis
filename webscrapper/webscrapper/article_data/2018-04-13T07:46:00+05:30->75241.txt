GURUGRAM: A court on Thursday dismissed the petition challenging the relocation of the   coming in the alignment of   underpass. With this order, the underpass work is likely to be completed soon. 

 Soon after getting the copy of the order,   handed over the possession of the plot in Sector 42 to MG Road petrol pump owner Sukhjeet Mann on Thursday. “We will start shifting the petrol pump from Friday and it is likely to take three-four weeks to complete the relocation,” said Mann.
 
 Huda estate officer Bharat Bhushan Gogia said, “After shifting the petrol pump, the stalled underpass work can be restarted.” Huda had earlier allotted the plot in Sector 42 on   to MG road fuel station owner, as the pump was coming in the alignment of the Iffco Chowk underpass. 
 
 The land allotted for fuel station was earmarked for a taxi stand in the master plan. The owner of a building — Ameya One, located near the said site — had filed a petition before district and sessions court on February 7, questioning Huda’s change of land plan. During the hearing the court had put a stay on the shifting of the fuel station. 
 
 On Thursday, Civil Judge (senior division)   dismissed the petition under condition that the petrol pump should be built in a manner so that visibility of the petitioner’s building is not diminished.
