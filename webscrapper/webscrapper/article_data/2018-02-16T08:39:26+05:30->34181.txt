ROHTAK: Reacting strongly to the BJP’s ‘Yuva Hunkar Rally’ at Jind on Thursday, former state home minister and senior   leader   said the deployment of paramilitary and Haryana Police personnel for the event gave an Emergency-like feeling to the public.

 Former Rohtak MLA Batra said he did not understand the need to employ law enforcement agencies and “misuse” government machinery for holding a rally of a political party. “The BJP has tried to instill fear in the minds of public and attempted to polarize votes before the crucial 2019 Haryana assembly elections,” he said, addressing newspersons at his residence on Thursday.
 
 Calling it a threat to the democratic setup, Batra said crores of rupees were wasted by the government on arranging paraphernalia to showcase its achievements. “The fact is that no demand whether it’s related to farmers, employment to youths and developmental projects has been fulfilled in the past four years,” he said.
 
 Batra also dubbed detention of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee chief   as murder of democracy by stifling the voice of opposition and dissenting forces.
 
 Opening a front against the BJP for an extravagant rally in which over one lakh motorcycle riders were called at Jind, Aam Aadmi Party’s Haryana unit president Naveen Jaihind said the event addressed by BJP president Amit Shah was not ‘hunkar’, but ‘dakar’ (burping) rally as crores of rupees were splashed to please him.
 
 Addressing a press conference at Rohtak, Jaihind said though a lot of money was spent on arranging things and police and paramilitary forces were deployed, the much-advertised rally turned out to be a flop show. “Not even 5,000 bikes reached the rally venue,” he said.
 
 Jaihind said at a time when the state was witnessing crime against women, murders and failure of law and order, the ruling party was busy celebrating its four years in power and seek votes for the next poll.
