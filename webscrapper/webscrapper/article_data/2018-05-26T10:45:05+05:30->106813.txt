If things go as planned, soon you would be able to see both   and   Gohil in a Gujarati web series.The duo was shooting for the pilot episode of the same when we caught up with them on the sets on a hot summer afternoon. It is an interesting debut for both of them - while Malhar would be seen acting in his first web series, Manasi has donned the hat of a producer. Malhar happily shared, “I am super elated to be working for a web-series. What more can I ask than working with someone as talented as Manasi. I remember watching her musical play Maro Piyu Gayo Rangoon. Whether be acting or singing in it, she was brilliant with both.”
Manasi said, “I am enjoying my new role as a producer. Once the pilot episode gets an approval, I will have a lot to focus on. Right now, we all are just enjoying shooting for the project.” 
 We loved the totally different look Malhar was sporting for this web-series and, we are eagerly waiting to see the duo on screen now!
