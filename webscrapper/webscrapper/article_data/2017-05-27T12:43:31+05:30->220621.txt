INDORE: The   of the newly elected body of the district court   was held at its   on Friday. Top priorities of the association for the coming year were also declared on the occasion. 

 Proper hygiene and sanitation in toilets, canteen facility exclusively for lawyers and digitization of the bar association for maintenance of advocates’ accounts, are the significant issues on which the newly elected body will work.
 
 The presence of two female members in the   and youngsters as post holders of the bar association has resulted in these issues being taken up by the association with main concern. 
 
 The toilet at the female bar room and also for men at other places is currently being used both by advocates and litigants. “Due to the general use of toilets in female bar room by all hygiene need to be maintained. For the female litigants, there are three separate public toilets around the court, which can be used,” said executive body member Prasoon Birthare.
 
 Similarly, gents toilets on the court premises should be used only by advocates, the association officials feel. 
 
 Another issue on which actions will be taken at the earliest is the opening of a canteen exclusively for the advocates. “Currently all the canteens functional at the court are being operated by private parties, who do not serve food at reasonable rates. There is a need for a canteen, where only advocates will be given lunch in thali form and at low rates,” said newly elected president   said. He aslo said that the first general body meeting of the newly formed bar association will be held on May 29.
 
 The young members in the newly elected body of the bar has also pressed for digitization of the records of all advocates and their accounts, for which funds will be kept aside and new computers will be installed expeditiously.
