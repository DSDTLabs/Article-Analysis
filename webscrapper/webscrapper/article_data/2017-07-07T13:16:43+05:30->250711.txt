CHANDIGARH: A local court has awarded three years of rigorous imprisonment to two men who robbed a poor waiter on February 9 last year. The convicts—Sagar (20) of Sector 25 and   (24) of Ram Darbar Phase 2—were booked at the Sector-11 police station.

 Additional sessions judge   delivered the prison sentence on Thursday. On the night of the crime, waiter   was on his way home after serving at a party in Sector 44. His contractor,  , had dropped him at the Sector-17 bus stand and he while walking to Dhanas, he had reached the dividing road of Sectors 24 and 15 near   around 12.45am when an auto-rickshaw on the wrong side blocked his path.
 
 Two men stepped out of it with an axe, the edge of which they kept on his neck and told him to empty his pockets. They also took away his mobile phone. Being illiterate, Shiv Ram couldn't recall his contact number or read the auto-rickshaw's registration plate. But he remembered the attackers' appearance.
 
 After being robbed, he hailed a passing driver and shared with him the incident. The driver rang up police helpline, after which a first-information report (FIR) was registered. Investigation led police to Sagar and Suraj and they recovered Shiv's PAN-card copy from one of them. The defence pleaded for a lenient sentence but the court said a tough sentence was must to abate the spate of robberies and snatching.
