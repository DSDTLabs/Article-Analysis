PARIS: Yuki Bhambri’s   first-round clash against Belgian lucky loser   will be more a match-up of likes. Both counter-punchers prefer hardcourts. While the 25-year-old India No. 1 chose to stay on the faster surface in the lead-up to the second major of the year, Bemelmans toiled on clay, with little success.

 
 
 Bhambri arrived in Paris a week back and said he was feeling more comfortable on the surface with every practice session. His 30-yearold opponent, however, has the advantage of matches under his belt. He played three   on clay, where he won just one match before falling in the first round of the qualifying draw in the  . He did better here, winning two rounds.
 
 Bhambri, ranked No. 93, who is here with coach Stephen Koon, has never played the 111th ranked-Bemelmans before.
 
 “Since I have played so much on hardcourts, it’s about making the adjustments to your game. You slide more here, you put more into every ball you hit, you have to hit more balls before you can put one away,” Bhambri, who enjoyed a free-hitting session with American Jared Donaldson over the weekend, said.
 
 “I’m going to play aggressively, go for my shots,” he said, adding, “maybe I need to be more patient, but I don’t want to stay back and rally from the baseline. In the end, I have to be at my best and play my best no matter who I am playing. This is a Grand Slam.”
 
 When the Delhi-based pro steps onto an outside court at Roland Garros he will become the first Indian to play the main draw of the men’s singles event here since Somdev Devvarman in 2013.
