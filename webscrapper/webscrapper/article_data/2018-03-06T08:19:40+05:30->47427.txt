 If judicial officers adjourn a case which has been pending for five years or more, for longer than seven days, they get an SMS from the high court, reminding them to take care of the old case as soon as possible.
 
 According to the HC’s registrar general, P R Patel, all judges of the lower judiciary have been instructed to not adjourn old cases — those pending for more than five years — for longer than a week.
 
 They must insist on completion of hearings expeditiously. If a judge defers such a case for more than a week, the next morning he will get a reminder on his mobile phone via a systemgenerated SMS. Each judge will also get a list of such adjourned cases. In Gujarat’s lower courts, there are still 15,95,011cases pending. Of these, 2,44,657 (15.34%) cases are pending with district, magisterial and civil courts for more than a decade.
 
 There are 2.63,119 (16.5%) cases pending for a period between five and ten years. Across India, there are 22,57,996 cases pending before the lower judiciary for more than 10 years.
 
 They represent 8.52% of all cases pending in lower courts. There are 42,42,425 (16.01%) cases pending before lower courts for more than five years.
 
 The registrar general said that efforts are being made to reduce the backlog, which is believed to be hampering routine court proceedings and further delaying the process of imparting justice. “Pendency before lower courts was more than 22 lakh a couple of years ago. It has now come down to less than 16 lakh, due to sustained efforts to introduce various disposal modes. There were more than 7.5 lakh cases that pending for longer than five years, but that figure has also reduced now considerably,” he said.
