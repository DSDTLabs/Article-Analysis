Ahmedabad: The 13th raising day of the Border Security Force Gujarat Frontier was celebrated on Saturday on various BSF campuses under the frontier HQ, BSF Gujarat. The BSF’s Gujarat Frontier was raised on April 1, 2004, to guard the international border of the state and Rajasthan’s Barmer district. 

 IG   Ajay Tomar addressed the troops and appreciated the service of officers and personnel. Various sports activities and competitions were held to mark the occasion, on the BSF campus in Gandhinagar. They included a cricket match; drawing, fancy dress, and cooking competitions; essay writing; and a cultural programme. A ‘badakhana’ was organized which was attended by serving and retired BSF officials and their families.
 
 Tomar said that the border with Pakistan has been effectively managed and there had not been any incident of infiltration or exfiltration. “In the creek area, 18 Pakistan fishing boats have been seized over the past year and 27 Pakistani fishermen have been apprehended and handed over to police,” he said. 
 
 Tomar said that many Pakistani fishermen venture into the creek area to catch freshwater fish and escape on the sight of a BSF patrol party. “We have placed a demand for regular boats for patrolling the creek area. We already have all-terrain vehicles to patrol the marshy areas of the creek,” he said. He said that in May, the BSF would organize an under-19 Prime Minister football tournament for boys and girls. tnn
