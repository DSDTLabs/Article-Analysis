PATNA: The newly elected president of Bihar chapter of   (IMA), Dr  , expressed concern over attacks on doctors and healthcare providers.
 
  Speaking at the 72nd annual conference, known as BIMACON-2017, organized here on Saturday, he said, “The cases of violence against doctors have increased. The government should implement Medical Protection Act 2008 instead of Bihar Medical Service Institution and Personal Protection Act 2011. We always live in fear,” he said and expressed concern over scarcity of doctors, paramedical and health facilities in the state.
  
  Talking about Clinical Establishment Act, he said although the state IMA is not against centre’s Act 2010 in its totality, it believes that Bihar Clinical Establishment (Registration and Control) Act 2007 is more doctor-friendly. “Only 10 out of the 29 states have implemented Clinical Establishment Act 2010 and that, too, not properly,” he said.
  
  State   said doctors need not worry about their safety. “Government is there to provide proper protection to doctors and they should concentrate on providing healthcare to the patients,” Pandey said.
  
  He also said although the Medical Protection Act could not be implemented, “the home department has ordered its officials to treat doctors’ safety on a priority basis”.
  
  Dr   from Chhapra was elected the IMA president for 2018-19.
  
  State IMA also elected ten divisional vice-presidents for 2017-18, including former secretary Dr Harihar Dixit (Patna), Dr Ajay Kumar (Bihta), Dr Sachidanand Sharma (Gaya) and Dr Bimal Karak (Patna East).
  
  Former president Dr D P Singh said every district should have a grievance cell. He said doctors would fast at all the district and state IMA headquarters on October 2 against the central government policies such as the exit exam, clinical establishment Act, and   Bill.
