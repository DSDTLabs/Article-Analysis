LUDHIANA: After facing resentment from the encroachers in   flats on Thursday, now the MC officials claimed they will go for an eviction drive with adequate force. However, MC officials said they will remove the encroachers at any cost.

 The civic authorities claimed it is necessary to boost the morale of the MC employees especially after the Thursday incident when a 19-year-old youth was electrocuted after he had climbed a transformer in protest against the drive. The   encroachers will get time till May 22 as the local court has asked the complainant to show proofs. Till then, the MC officials will not conduct any drive in the area.
 
 In Giaspura, MC had constructed 2,176 flats out of which 1,727 are allotted. The vacant flats were occupied illegally. The MC has to allot flats to around 107 families residing in the houses near Jagraon Bridge.
 
 The MC has started the eviction of illegal occupants from Giaspura flats for the past 10 days. They had served notices to around 250 such illegal occupants who could not produce any documents. Some of the flats were already vacated by the illegal occupants. However, they had kept their luggage in the adjoining flats as well. On Thursday, the MC teams had gone to vacate at least 50 flats.
 
 The MC Commissioner Jaskiran Singh said they will surely remove the illegal occupants from the flats. However, they will wait till the situation comes under control in Giaspura flats. He said they will demand adequate cops from the police commissioner and then conduct an eviction drive.
 
 Meanwhile, the encroachers living near Jagraon Bridge had moved to court. On Thursday, the court has asked them to bring more documents in the next hearing on May 22. The assistant town planner (headquarter) SS Bindra said the matter is in court so they cannot do anything to remove the encroachers from that place even though the notice period will come to end on Saturday.
