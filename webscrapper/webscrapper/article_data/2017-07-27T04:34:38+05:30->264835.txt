MUMBAI: Two men duped a   of Rs 30,000 at a nationalized bank in Vile Parle (E) by pretending to help him fill the deposit slip. 

 Based on the senior citizen’s complaint, police have sought the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage from the bank to identify the accused.
 
 In his complaint, Navin Nagada (63) said on Tuesday, around 12.30pm, he was waiting the queue at the bank to deposit Rs 80,000, when a well-dressed man approached him and said that he would have to make entry in the deposit slip. At the same time, the other man, also well-dressed, offered to help. “While one of the men pretended to help him fill the deposit slip, the other flicked Rs 30,000 from the bundle while counting the notes,” said senior inspector Laxman Chavan.
 
 After filling the slip, one of the accused stood behind Nagada in the queue at the deposit counter. Nagada said, “I was shocked when the bank official said I had handed over Rs 50,000 and not Rs 80,000. I turned to speak with the men, but they had vanished.” He complained to the bank officials and later filed a police complaint.
