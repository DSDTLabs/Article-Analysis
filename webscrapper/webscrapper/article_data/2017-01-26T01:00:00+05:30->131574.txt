  As he went into a party mode and sang some of his dance numbers like Maria Maria, he asked the audience, “Kya yeh party subah 6 baje tak chalegi?” When the audience replied, ‘Yes’, he asked, “Yeh ground kya mere chacha ka hai?” He also asked the students to follow him and jump and dance during his performance.
