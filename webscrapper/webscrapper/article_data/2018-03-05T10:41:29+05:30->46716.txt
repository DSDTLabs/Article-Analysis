NEW DELHI: Punjab's   chief minister   took to Twitter to scold Prime Minister   for "frivolous statements" and for attempting to drive a wedge between him and his party.

 
 After it was reported that Modi said, "the Congress does not even consider their CM their own" in Punjab, Amarinder sarcastically asked the PM on Twitter whether the party high command had complained directly to him about it.
 
 "Who told you that @narendramodi ji? Not me for sure. Did the @INCIndia high command complain to you against me?" asked the Punjab CM.
 
 Modi had also said that Amarinder "marches on, like an independent soldier". The Punjab CM didn't take kindly to that either and cautioned Modi against making "frivolous" statements.
 
 "Anyways, let me make it clear that such frivolous statements won't help you create a wedge between me and my party, which has full faith in my leadership & vice versa," said 
  .
 
  
  
 
 The Congress party's Punjab unit also took a dig at Modi yesterday, saying that by calling Amarinder an "independent soldier", the PM was acknowledging that the "free and democratic culture" prevailing in the Congress unlike in the  .
 
  "This is quite contrary to the autocratic and dictatorial culture prevailing in the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) under Modi, where saner and seasoned voices like those of L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi,   and Shatrughan Sinha have either been silenced or banished to the Marg Darshak Mandal," said Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar yesterday.
