GHAZIABAD: Residents of highrises in Indirapuram are at loggerheads with villagers of Kanawani over the installation of a height barrier on Pushta Road leading to  .

 A team of   officials had arrived at the spot to install a barrier on Wednesday afternoon, but had to beat a hasty retreat after facing opposition from villagers. The police will now hold a meeting with residents, GDA officials and villagers at Indirapuram police station on January 8 to resolve the issue.
 
 At present, a height barrier is installed on one carriageway of the road right in front of   housing society. This barrier was installed by the GDA in 2016 after residents complained that heavy vehicles were using Pushta Road to take a detour from NH-24 to CISF Road through the densely populated   2 and causing dust pollution.
 
 Kapil Singhal, a resident of Niho Scottish Garden, said, “Dumpers, trucks and even mixers, carrying construction material, use Pushta Road to enter residential areas of Ahimsa Khand 2. They cause pollution in the area. In 2016, GDA had installed a height barrier on one carriageway of Pushta Road. However, villagers in Kanawani complained that buses of a private school located in the Hindon floodplains will not be able to travel through the road. So the other carriageway was left open. GDA later installed a barrier on this carriageway last year. But villagers had brought it down a few months later.”
 
 “The barrier that is sought to be installed will allow passage for cars, SUVs and other mid-size vehicles. But carriers and trucks will not able to pass through the road. The decision was taken following complaints of residents about traffic jams and pollution in Ahimsa Khand 2 due to entry of heavy vehicles,” said GDA assistant engineer Suresh Kumar Chauhan.
 
 “No complaint has been filed. The police will mediate to ensure a solution,” said CO Rakesh Kumar Mishra.
