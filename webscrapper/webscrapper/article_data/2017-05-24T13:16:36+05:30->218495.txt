Among the scanty number of scientists that we, the pop-culture devotees, can name,   is a hands-down favourite. With his lucid ways of describing the most complex phenomena of the universe, the 58-year-old   brings to the common man his recent book, 
 , a thoroughly enjoyable read that distills the past, present and future of the cosmos.

 Tyson’s signature conversational style finds a new expression in the book, where he explains, in the simplest yet the most beguiling manner, the essential principles of the universe that we, as non-scientifically-inclined people, have been too vain to decipher. He covers the basics in easy, digestible chapters -- the components that form the cosmos, the forces and laws that govern the interaction between stellar bodies, and the scientists who pieced together the processes shaping our reality.
 
 One of the most enticing elements of Tyson’s book is how he tries to provide compelling tidbits that overwhelm you to the extreme and you run around all day to pass on that information to someone else. In the book, Tyson emphasizes that astrophysics does not need to be inaccessible. As he explicates the human sense of connectedness with the universe and their place within it, Tyson also imagines alien civilization and the human limitations to decrypt it. 
  presents Tyson’s clean and straightforward narrative, and he successfully replaces scientific jargon with penny-plain language, making science loveable and approachable to everyone. This sublime introduction to some of the most exciting ideas in astrophysics will definitely leave readers wanting more.
