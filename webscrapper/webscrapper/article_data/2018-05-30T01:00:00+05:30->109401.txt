 The actor who is also seen playing young   in the show 'Chandrashekhar', said it was becoming difficult for him to break his image of Baal Veer and play the role of a freedom fighter. "It took me around a month to prepare for this role through workshops and rehearsals. It was difficult for me to portray a character so different from Baal Veer. Breaking the image is not what matters to me but creating another one, simultaneously, is what matters now. People still think of me as Baal Veer. Take for instance   ji. He did so many roles, but today he is still remembered as Shaktimaan. Likewise, Baal Veer's character will always be associated with my name, which I think is an achievement for me but I do want to break away from this image of a child actor now and play some mature characters, " said Dev.
