INDORE: After the   threatened to take strict action under the Essential Services Maintenance Act ( ), protesting junior doctors on Wednesday returned to work.

 “In a meeting with the hospital’s superintendent, we came to an agreement that the hospital management will be given a month’s time to fulfill our demands. If they fail, we will then decide our further course of action,” JUDA spokesperson Dr Avinash   told TOI.
 
 He added that the hospital management have increased the number of security guards and restricted entry of attenders. A majority of their demands are however yet to be fulfilled.
 
 “Though we are not 100 per cent satisfied with the hospital management’s steps, we have decided to return to work by 2pm for the sake of the patients,” Dr Patwari said.
 
 By the time the doctors called off their protest, their duty hours had already ended. After returning from a three-day leave, the doctors rendered their services in emergency cases.
 
 In the first half of Wednesday, people visiting the out-patient department (OPD) complained as they had to wait in a long queue to get doctors’ advice for their problems.
 
 Attenders of patients undergoing treatment in the hospital also complained about the lack of doctors and medical staff to help them with medical investigations, completing paper work and providing assistance in treatment.
 
 Some surgeries planned during the morning hours were also postponed due to the junior doctors’ protest.
