PATNA: The BJP on Monday took a dig at former deputy chief minister and leader of opposition in state assembly   for his plans to launch statewide ‘Nyay Yatra’ from Katihar on February 10 to mobilise people against the perceived danger to the country’s Constitution under the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

 State health minister and former state BJP chief Mangal Pandey said   should first “save RJD, his father Lalu Prasad and entire family”. “It was Lalu and his family members who violated the Constitution and laws of the land to make benami property,” Pandey said.
 
 Rudy’s plea to Gadkari: Former Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy on Monday called on Union minister for road transport and national highways   at his official residence in New Delhi and pleaded for the conversion of the 150km road between Sonepur and Manjhi into national highway.
 
 In his communiqué, Rudy said he met Gadkari along with another BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal and submitted the plea on behalf of other MPs from the area – Union minister Radha  , Janardan Singh Sigriwal,   Yadav, Ajay Nishad and Janak Ram.
 
 The existing 150km road, which is proposed to link Sonepur with the Nepal border, passes through Dariapur, Maker, Amnaur, Taraiya, Panapur, Mashrakh, Baikunthpur, Sidhwalia and Barauli. Rudy said its conversion into national highway had strategic importance.
 
 The six   constituencies through which the road is proposed to pass are Muzaffarpur, Saran, Siwan, Gopalganj, West Champaran and Valmikinagar.
