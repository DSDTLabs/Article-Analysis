KOLKATA: Three persons were detained for allegedly collecting bodies of dead animals from Subhash Udyan — a garbage dump in Budge Budge — on Thursday. Locals said the meat of these animals are sent to different restaurants in Kolkata. Cops, however, said they are yet to confirm whether it was supplied as food or sent to zoo for the animals there.

 “We have detained   Mullick, a   worker, and taxi driver  . We are looking for the main accused   and Sani,” said an investigating officer of Budge Budge police station said.
 
 The incident surfaced when locals noticed disappearance of dead animals from the dumping ground. “We started to keep a watch and found that once an animal is thrown on the ground Raja informed Sani and Nimai. The duo then cleaned and packaged it neatly. Later they loaded loaded the carcass in Shyamlal’s car and was sent to Kolkata. As the ground is at the end of the city so people hardly noticed the crime,” a local said.
