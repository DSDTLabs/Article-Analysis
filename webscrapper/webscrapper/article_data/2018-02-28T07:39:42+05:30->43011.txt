HYDERABAD: In an effort to get to the roots of the Waqf records so that properties belonging to the   in Telangana can be verified, the minorities welfare department is scouting for Persian language translators for the records. The department is planning to engage about 15 to 20 people to get the Persian records translated into   and English. This will help the minorities welfare department establish ownership of properties vested with the governments as well as the present status of such properties. 

 Officials said the Waqf Board owns about 33,000 properties including buildings and land covering 70,000 acres. With many properties and land being encroached by individuals and institutions, the chief minister   directed minorities welfare and revenue departments to survey all Waqf properties in the state to protect these lands.
 
 Since most of the original records are in Persian, it has become a herculean task for the government to come to a conclusion on the ownership of the lands. Officials say translation is important as many lands that have been encroached have no proper records with the Waqf Board. 
 
 "The department is getting records translated, in case a dispute arises or it involves litigation. Now the plan is to translate all the 30,000 records into Urdu and English. For getting translators, the department is approaching state archives,   (as it offers a course in Persian), as well as the  ," Dana Kishore, Secretary of minorities welfare department, told TOI. 
 
 He said if the department still falls short of Persian translators, some other institutions such as Persian Research Institute of Aligarh Muslim University will be contacted. The state has asked the minorities welfare department to complete the survey with the ongoing Land Records Purification Programme. 
 
 In all 31 districts, the Board owns 32,929 properties covering about 77,538 acres. But only 32,596 properties were notified in the state gazette
