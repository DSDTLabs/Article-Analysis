BENGALURU: A city   on Friday denied bail to   and his six associates who have been accused of attempting to murder a youth at a restaurant in UB City on February 17. 

 Parameshwara Prasanna B, judge of the 63th   and sessions court, held that the accused are not entitled to bail, at least till the completion of investigation.
 
 While   had approached the court separately, his co-accused had jointly filed another petition. The judge read out his one-line order, saying the bail petitions have been rejected.
 
 "Considering the nature of accusations against the petitioner, the evidence, injuries sustained by the victim, pendency of further investigation, reasonable apprehension of witnesses being influenced and larger interest of the public and state, I am of the opinion that the petitioner is not entitled to bail, at least till the probe is over," the order read.
 
 After verifying the   footage recovered from the spot and hospital, the court felt that grounds like names of suspects not figuring in the FIR or complaint are not enough for granting of bail.
