PATNA: In a joint raid conducted by the   of the health department, 100 vials of expired anti-snake venom and antibiotic injections meant for supply in state  , were seized from four locations of the city. Nine people were arrested, and they included kingpin  .

 According to official sources, the seized drugs are estimated to be worth Rs 20 lakh.
 
 The raids were conducted at Shree Hanuman Agency and its two godowns in Babu Tola lane on Govind Mitra Road, and Mahalaxmi Traders on Ashok Raj Path. The licence for Hanuman agency is issued in the name of Dheeraj Kumar and that of Mahalaxmi Traders in the name of Renuka Devi. The raids were continuing till reports last came in on Saturday evening.
 
 Dheeraj and Renuka are brother and mother of Neeraj, who had been to jail thrice in the past for involvement in fake and expired drug racket.
 
 Patna drug inspector   said expired anti-snake venoms would certainly result in the death of patients, if used. He said expired physician’s samples and expired medicines re-stamped with fresh expiry dates were also seized from the four locations.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said investigations were on to know from where was Neeraj procuring the medicines and to whom was he selling. He said the raids were linked to the earlier raids in which expired and fake drugs worth several crores were seized from multiple locations in Patna on April 21.
 
 Around 20,000 expired Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Corporation Limited’s capsules, meant for free supply in government hospitals, were also seized during the April raid.
 
 Sources said the firms were blacklisted in 2005, but Neeraj’s family got the licences again due to proximity with people in power.
