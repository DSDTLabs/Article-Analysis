PANAJI: Accusing bureaucracy of hurrying to implement the Supreme Court’s order of   and   within 500 metres of national and state highways,   on Monday threatened a public protest if interests of shop owners are not safeguarded. 

 “We demand that the government of Goa take measures to protect the genuine interests of Goan businessmen and dependents. The GFP also calls for an immediate halt to the tearing hurry shown by the bureaucracy for implementation of the order,” party spokesperson Durgadas Kamat said, adding that the move would adversely impact the ‘traditional’ business of the locals. 
 
 “Goa’s traditional ‘tavernas’ standing from pre-liberation times and the already established bars and liquor establishments provide the ancillary services to the tourism industry, apart from contributing substantial revenue to the government. The entire trade has made life and living of lakhs of Goemkars which cannot be erased just by a stroke of a pen and without giving a fair and just hearing to the affected interests,” Kamat said. 
 
 The party also threatened that if the government fails to put up a strong case in front of the  , they will launch protests similar to what were witnessed in Tamil Nadu to reverse a SC order on Jallikattu. 
 
 “Do not force the people to come on the streets and agitate on the lines of Jalikattu and raise issues like “Dhirio” by crushing established business. No doubt, road accidents is a serious issue and needs to be addressed but we will not allow local businessmen and traders to be condemned as villains,” Kamat said.
