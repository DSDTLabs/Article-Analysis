 Countering this objection, the petitioners said each court had inherent power to hear any petition regarding public interest under article 226 of the Indian constitution.
 
 “We also referred to a similar order passed by the Delhi high court in the case of Social Jurists versus Government of Delhi. In this, the court had issued directions to the hospitals that had been given land in Delhi at subsidised rates. It said they must comply with conditions of the agreement and should provide free treatment to the poor mandatorily. The hospitals had moved to the Apex Court challenging this judgment. However the Supreme Court upheld the high court’s verdict,” Upendra Singh Chandrawat, petitioner’s counsel said.
 
 The petitioner had claimed that the Bombay hospital trust had been given land at a prime location at a subsidied rent for the construction of a hospital on the condition that at least 15 percent of the total patients being treated at the hospital who belonged to low income groups will be treated for free, or else, the land lease will be cancelled.
 
 The court has reserved the order on the question of admission of the petition. In this petition, show cause notices had been issued by the court to the respondents including IDA, Bombay hospital trust, housing and environment department, IMC commissioner and public health and welfare department, in August 2016.
