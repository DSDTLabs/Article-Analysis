Mussoorie: Sixty-five-year-old Himdei has seen her 40-year-old son, who worked as a driver once, reduced to an alcoholic. “We had to send him back to keep him away from   and further inflicting damage on himself. He is a lost man,” she said trying hard to control her tears.
 Sunday, usually a busy day at tourist spot of Dhanaulti, saw Himdei along with 14 others women destroying two cartons stuffed with liquor bottles at a newly-opened liquor shop.
  
  Most of the women and many youths in   and nearby villages heaved a sigh of relief when a 15-year-old liquor vend was closed following the Supreme Court’s order of no liquor shops within 500 metre of both national and state highways.
  
  A fortnight back, however, the shop opened in a newer avatar at another prominent location near tehsil in Dhanaulti.
  
  Even though Dhanaulti is a  , locals, especially women, believe that liquor vends should not be opened in the area as they bring havoc in their domestic lives.
  
  As 40-year-old Beena Devi puts it, “Whatever men earn in the day, they spend on   in the evening. And, beat up their women and children after they return home. Many families have been destroyed. We don’t want a liquor shop here.”s
  
  A man who doesn’t wish to be named says, “Liquor shops are important in view of greater tourists’ footfall. We know how popular Dhanaulti is with tourists; hence, the absence of liquor shops may harm tourism businesses.”
  
  Himdei, her women companion and many youths, however, disagree. “I don’t want other mothers to suffer like me,” says Himdei.
  
  Mamta Devi from Nakurchi said, “We are willing to take the fight against liquor further. We have written to the district magistrate, and will not sit quiet.”
