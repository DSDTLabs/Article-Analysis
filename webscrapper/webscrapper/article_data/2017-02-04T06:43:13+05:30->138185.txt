MUMBAI: It will be a fierce fight for the post of mayor in the   (BMC). 

 The state government on Friday, threw a draw of lots, decided which of the 27 municipal corporations in the state would have reservations. For Mumbai, the post has remained in the open category. Which means any individual, male or female, from any group or community can contest for this position.
 
 This also means that more candidates may enter the fray since there is no bar on gender or caste. Appointment to the mayoral post is a prerogative of the winning party, but even within the party with the highest number of seats, there can be several hopefuls. Now that the Mumbai mayor's job is open to any candidate who wins the civic election, the field is likely to widen. 
 
 Senior women corporators in the BMC, however, feel that since that since the outgoing mayor,  , is a woman, parties will try to install a man this time. Besides, with reservations out of the way and a greater proportion of male candidates in the fray, this appears a more likely outcome."When it is kept open, generally men get a chance. They bring in women only when there is a reservation," said a senior corporator. Of the 27 municipal corporations in the state, mayoral posts for 13 are in the open category while 14 have been reserved for women. Of the 27, 10 are going to polls on February 21.
 
 In most neighbouring corporations including Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Pune, the post has been reserved for women. In Panvel, it has been reserved for a woman from the Scheduled caste community. And in   and Navi Mumbai, it has been reserved for candidates from the Other Backward Class (OBC).
 
 The draw of lots was held by the urban development department in Mantralaya on Friday.
