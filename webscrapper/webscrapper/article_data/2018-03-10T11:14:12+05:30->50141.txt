VADODARA: The   Chambers of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) council that met in the city on Thursday said that the pending issue of refund of exporters is still causing problems for the industries.   president, Shailesh   said that they have taken up the matter with the government and many exporters have started receiving their long-pending refunds. 

 “Gujarat’s industries are waiting for their pending   refunds of Rs 30,000 crore. There is a problem in the online system and so we have asked the government to accept the hard copies till the glitch is solved,” Patwari said. He added that the GST had initially created several issues but now the industrial growth is back on track. 
 
 Patwari said that the GCCI has also taken up a project to make hygienic washrooms on the highway from Ahmedabad to   and Somnath. “Tourists often complaint of unclean washrooms on this route. So we will tie up with petrol pumps for building and maintaining the washrooms. The   Trust will also help us. Food joints will also be made on this route,” Patwari added.
