GURUGRAM: Power discom DHBVN has announced a special summer plan to streamline the supply to tony areas of Gurgaon — DLF phases 1, 2, 3, 4 and Sushant Lok Phase 1 — and bring down the outages by about 95%.

 This, discom officials said, will ensure uninterrupted power supply to these areas whose residents had been negotiating pesky   for years owing to shoddy infrastructure. Pertinently, HVPN officials revealed that the DLF sub-division accounted for the 80% use of smoke-belching DG sets in Gurgaon generating almost 120 MVA of energy. 
 
 Power officials are of the view that if power cuts in this sub-division are reduced, the city will witness a drastic slump in the use of DG sets. 
 
 The key part of the plan is to set up a separate 11 KVA feeder for the Nathupur village that until now had been drawing electricity from 11 KVA lines of DLF Phase 3 feeder, which according to officials, was frequently tripping on account of overloading. The lines will originate from 66 KV substation located in Sikandarpur. Officials said many overhead lines in these areas are being laid underground so that bad weather will not trigger disruptions. 
 
 “We have replaced axial bunch cables of 11 KVA feeder in Sector 43 that originates from the 66 KV sub-station in Sector 44 as it was faulting,” said Kuldeep Nehra, sub-division officer,  . Nehra added that a new 11 KVA feeder was also being added to Wellington area that drew power from 66KV sub-station in Sector 43.
