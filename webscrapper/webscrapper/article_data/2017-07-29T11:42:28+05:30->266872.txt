CHENNAI: Rahil Shah yet again showcased his class in the shortest format of the game. The Tamil Nadu left-armer put up a superb display of spin bowling (12/4 in 4 overs) to help   register a five-wicket win over   at the ICL Ground, Tirunelveli on Friday.
 
 Rahil, who played a pivotal role in TN's twin-title victories in the limited-overs domestic competitions earlier this year and represented South Zone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20, dismantled a powerful Dindigul batting unit with his guile. Dindigul entered this match on the back a crushing 10-wicket win over Madurai in their last encounter.
  
 Medium-pacer   (1/7) handed Thiruvallur the first break through in the first ball of the match, dismissing the dangerous Subramania Siva (0), who had scored a breath-taking 41-ball 84 against Madurai.
  
 From then on, it was a Rahil show. Last year's TNPL sensation   (12) failed to read a Rahil arm-ball and was trapped lbw in the fifth over. No 4 M Ashwin (1) was the next to depart castled by the 31-year-old spinner, who was called up for a trial with Gujarat Lions mid-way through the last IPL.
  
 It began Dindigul's slide. Soon, NS Chaturved ran Dindigul's two key batsmen opener V   and Wilkins Victor (3) out. Skipper Ashwin Venkataraman (19) tried to rescue his side with R Vivek (13) but Rahil broke through. Ashwin was beaten in the air and was stumped by R Rajan. Dindigul were eventually bowled out for 83 in 17.5 overs with good support from R Silambarasan (2/18), R Sanjay Yadav (1/13) and   (0/23).
  
 In defence of 84, pacer T Natarajan (2/12) did give his best to keep Dindigul in the hunt. Opener S Siddharth (37) looked in control before he was stumped by Jagadeesan off offie Victor. Left-arm spinner MS Sanjay (2/20) struck twice in four balls - removing Malolan (5) and Yadav (0) - as Thiruvallur found themselves in a bit of trouble at 63/5 in 11 overs.
  
 However, the experience of skipper B Aparajith (28 no) came to the fore and he saw his team home along with keeper Rajan (9 no) with 5.1 overs to spare.
  
 Brief scores: Dindigul Dragons 83 in 17.5 overs (Rahil Shah 4/12). VB Thiruvallur Veerans 84/5 in 14.5 overs. Thiruvallur won by 5 wkts.
