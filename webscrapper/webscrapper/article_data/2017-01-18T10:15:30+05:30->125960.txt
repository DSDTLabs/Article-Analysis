SHIMLA: The queen of hills is covered in pristine white snow. But a stink has been building underneath.

 For a town vying for a smart city tag, Shimla has not been able to provide water to residents nor arrange door-to-door garbage collection for the last 11 days. BJP has now decided to make sanitation and water shortage an election issue in the municipal elections in April this year.
 
 Shimla resident Ram Dev said he had not received a single drop of water since January 7. “What is the fun of living in a smart city if we do not get water for days together,” he said. Ravinder Chauhan, another resident, said prior arrangements should have been made to ensure supply of water and lifting of garbage. “For the last 11 days, garbage has been lying inside our house, which shows the MC had not planned to deal with snowfall,” said Indira Devi, a housewife.
 
 While residents of the hill town are forced to melt snow to meet their daily water needs, irrigation and public health minister   denied any shortage. She had claimed the town was being provided adequate water on alternate days. “If the minister’s statement is correct, why do the residents need to melt snow? The truth is neither is water is available nor is garbage being lifted from houses,” claimed BJP neta Karan Nanda.
 
 Municipal officials said though water was being pumped, it was not reaching households in some areas due to frozen supply lines.
