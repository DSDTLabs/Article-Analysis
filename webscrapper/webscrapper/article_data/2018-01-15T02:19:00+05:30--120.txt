Nandigama (Krishna district): Days after eloping, a 25-year-old boy approached district superintendent Sarva Sreshta Tripathi on Sunday seeking protection from the girl’s family members.

 The couple have been identified as Chaturvedula Suresh (25) and Kotha Srija (24). According to Suresh, both of them fell in love and wanted to tie the knot. When their parents refused they decided to elope. They fled the Nandigama in December, last year. 
 
 As the couple belonged to two different castes, their relationship was opposed by family members. On December 24, they got married at an Aarya Samaj. They then fled to Chennai with the help of their friends and within days, the girl’s parents took her away from the place. 
 
 The family members of the girl registered a   case against Suresh. The 25-year-old alleged that the DSP of Nandigama R Murali was taking the side of the girl as he belongs to the same caste. However, before they could arrest him, Suresh approached Krishna district SP Tripathi. He even produced his marriage certificate and photos before him. 
 
 The SP then inquired into the matter and reprimanded the officials. Cops have decided to counsel members of both families to facilitate an amicable solution to this problem.
