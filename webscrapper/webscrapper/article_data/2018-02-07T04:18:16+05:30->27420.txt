MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday sought the names of senior officials whom it can hold them accountable for failing to curb  .

 So miffed and disappointed was the bench of Justice   and Justice   at the state government’s efforts, it warned that these officials will be held responsible in future.
 
 In 2005, the HC converted a letter about a child who died after being harassed while working at an embroidery unit into a suo motu PIL In 2008, the state government submitted a comprehensive affidavit on its efforts.
 
 Questioning what has been done since, the judges noted that the progress is dismal. They asked whether children reported lost are searched in “such places” where they are employed and whether after rescue and hand over to parents, the officers wash their hands off. Pointing out that the law prohibits employing children below 14 years and Right to Education is guaranteed to all children between 6 and 14, they said “rescue means giving a meaningful life” to them. 
 
 The judges said there is a need for a change in the mindset. “You enjoy only power. No responsibility. Something beyond signing of muster rolls is expected. Unless the state cares for human existence, nothing will change,” said Justice Dharmadhikari. The bench said it wants “coordinated action” between officials to take stock of such cases. “We want that mechanism in place. We owe this much to our children.” It will pass an order on Thursday. —Rosy Sequiera
