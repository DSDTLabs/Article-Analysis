MARGAO: The Curchorem police on Sunday arrested Aditya  , the fifth accused in the   of 38-year-old Basavraj Bariki who was killed on April 1. 

 The police said Gujjar was nabbed on Saturday. “We obtained information he was seen in Ghaziabad. He was placed under arrest on Sunday,” Curchorem PI Ravindra Dessai said. The police earlier arrested four persons in the case, including his wife Kalpana.

 Gujjar, police sources said, played a key role in killing Basavraj by pinning him down as Kalpana went about strangulating him.
