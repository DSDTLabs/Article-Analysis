Even before I threw my hat into it, I used to hear a lot about the   in America. I had spoken to a number of my friends who had participated in earlier editions and each of them had only nice things to say about it.

 I would like to share with you a little secret first: I have not thought of anything beyond wrestling for the most part of my life. And it was this obsession that helped me become the Olympic and World champion. Before I analyse my competition, I must also thank my coach for making all this happen. For my first visit, he organised all my travel arrangements, including the flight and visa, in just 24 hours.
 
 
 I couldnâ€™t help but smile when the schedule was finally announced: I was drawn to fight that one wrestler who I have eagerly been waiting to fight against for some time now. I am talking about   of Tunisia, of Team Veer Marathas. Marwa is, however, a fierce competitor and will give me a stiff fight. She remains my toughest rival in this  .
