MOHALI:   minister for local bodies   has suspected irregularities in purchasing of portable toilets by the   municipal corporation (MC), announcing to issue another show-cause notice to mayor  . 

 Sidhu alleged   has purchased portable public toilets at higher prices, as the same have been purchased by the Chandigarh civic body for a lesser price.
 
 Taking a dig at Sidhu, Kulwant Singh said, "It seems either Sidhu lacks knowledge or his advisors are not feeding him proper information. The portable toilets have never been purchased by the Mohali MC, but were provided under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)."
 
 Recently, the local bodies department had issued a statement suspending Kulwant Singh from councillorship, but within two hours, the department made a U-turn and re-issued a statement claiming a show-cause notice had been issued to Kulwant Singh. The mayor has challenged the notice in the Punjab and   high court.
 
 Sidhu, while talking to TOI over phone, said he would soon send another show-cause notice to Kulwant Singh on the construction of public toilets in the city. He said, "We came to know that the toilets were constructed by spending Rs 42 lakh in Mohali, while the same toilets were built at Rs 15 lakh in Chandigarh. We are initiating an inquiry and Kulwant Singh should be ready to receive another notice."
 
 Sources in Mohali MC said the agenda point for purchasing portable toilets worth Rs 42 lakh was sent for approval with local bodies department and the tenders were called for. But the toilets were never purchased, rather 15 toilets were taken under CSR from a private company.
