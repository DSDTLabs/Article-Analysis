Director  's third movie   is the tale of Siby ( ), who is trying to make some easy money. His antics ends up ruining the trust of those who try to associate with him, also pushing his family into trouble. 

 
 
 Halfway through the first half, Sameera ( ) makes an appearance and it looks like she take the movie on another tangent. With his lucid style and originality, Fahadh is simply a treat to watch ever since his first scene. The film is visually rich and so is its charming soundscape. 
 
 Nedumudi Venu as Basheer, Dileesh Pothan as Thamban, Kochu Premam as Balan Pillai and Manikandan as Stalin are impressive. At the intermission, Siby lands in the midst of a forest. Will his stay change his destiny.
