AHMEDABAD: The first mega-job fair inaugurated by chief minister   at   ground on Saturday turned out to be cruel joke for former soldiers. A number of ex-servicemen who had come hopeful of employment after reading the brochure of the fair had to return empty-handed when company officials lamented that there were no such vacancies and it was all a printing mistake. In the brochure, 50 jobs were promised to ex-servicemen in a company named, ‘Motherson Sumi System Ltd’. The firm is a private automobile ancillary company based in Sanand. 

 Babu Desai, 38, was a driver in an armoured unit for 18 years and retired two months ago. He had come with high hopes but was crestfallen when he learnt about the ‘printing error’. Desai, a resident of Chandlodia, said he was in the armoured battalion and had served in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and in Pathankot, Punjab, for 18 odd years. 
 
 “I took retirement two months ago,” he said. “I was looking for employment after that. When I heard about the mega job fair, I came here to get employment in the private company but they told me that it was just a printing mistake.” He further said that the company was only recruiting youths who had been trained in an Industrial Training Institute (ITI).
 
 A person who identified himself as Karanveersingh Shekhawat was sitting at the private firm’s counter. He said that they had given correct details to the employment and training department but they must have made the error. “Four ex-Army men came to get a job because of this mistake,” he said.
 
 Officials of Directorate of Employment and Training in Gandhinagar said that they were not aware of any such incident. 
 
 “It is for a company to decide who it wants to employ. But I will certainly look into this case,” said SR Vijayvargiya, assistant director, emoployment. He claimed that around 315 companies had participated and nearly 9,000 people were offered jobs.
