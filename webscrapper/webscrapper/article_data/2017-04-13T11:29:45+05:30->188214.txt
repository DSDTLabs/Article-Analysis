AMRITSAR: To counter the propaganda of Pakistan radio, local MP   Aujla has demanded the installation of an FM transmitter on the 300m-high AIR tower situated on   road near the Indo-Pakistan border. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Aujla said that he had met Union minister of information and broadcasting Venkaiah Naidu and brought his attention towards the radio transmitter tower built in 2007.

 “The construction of the tower was completed in 2014 but no FM transmitter was installed due to which the station was still not commissioned,” Aujla said. He said the high-powered radio station was near the border with 70-80 miles (110-130 km) coverage area and was installed to counter Lahore radio, which had a deep penetration in the Indian territory along the border.
 
 He said the Lahore radio station in Pakistan had a high reach with multiple channels, the transmission of which was available in many border districts of Punjab. Aujla said, “The tower on the Attari road was constructed at a cost of Rs 20 crore and was meant to counter anti-India propaganda of Radio Pakistan. The civil and electrical works of the transmitter building had already been completed. The transmission from the Amritsar radio station would cover Sialkot and Gujranwala, along with Lahore. People in Pakistan would be able to hear programmes from Amritsar radio station due to digital terrestrial transmitters, which would make broadcastings easier.”
 
 Stating that the government was mulling cutting down the height of the tower, the   MP termed it as a cruel joke “I have urged Naidu to not reduce the height of the tower and instead begin the installation of the FM transmitter and set up a studio and production house in Amritsar,” he added.
