New Delhi: Two men were   for   a driver on   market road on Monday. The victim, Narender, helped the police identify the accused by giving them description of their jackets.

 The accused Monu and Jatin had prior criminal cases against them and belonged to   Delhi’s Khajuri Khas. 
 
 The incident was reported on January 13, when Narender was on his way to his employer’s residence in an Audi car. As soon as he reached Ghondi Chowk, two men on a blue scooter stopped ahead of him. When he asked them to move, they started hurling abuses at him.
 
 When Narender confronted them, the men got off the scooter and started banging the windshield of the vehicle. After a brief scuffle, the men pulled out a knife and stabbed Narender on his back and fled.
 
 Locals rushed the victim to a nearby hospital and informed the police. In his statement, Narender mentioned the jackets the accused was wearing which he found to be unique. 
 
 “We scrubbed through the CCTV footage of the area. A constable later identified one of the accused. He was interrogated during which he admitted to the crime,” said Nupur Prasad, DCP, Shahdara.
 
 Police said that Monu had 18 cases of robbery registered against him. 
 
 A case under sections of attempt to murder has been registered against him. Narender, meanwhile, was been discharged from the hospital after treatment.
