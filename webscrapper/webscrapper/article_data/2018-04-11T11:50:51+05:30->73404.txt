PANAJI: In what can be touted as a magnum opus in Goa’s drama industry, the heroic tale of Sambhaji — the eldest son of Shivaji and the second ruler of the Maratha kingdom — is being staged in the form of a live action drama titled ‘Shamburaje’.

 While it has been presented at a few schools in the state, this is the first time a large-scale staging has been organised, due to the efforts of the state department of art and culture and west zone cultural centre, Udaipur.
 
 What makes this work of art unique is that its cast comprises 520 characters all of which are being portrayed by students of  , Pernem. The inclusion of animals like horses, elephants and bulls, has also been made to support the sequences of the 2.5-hour-long ‘mahanatya’ that will soon be staged for the public, free of cost.
 
 “For the first time in India, over 500 children are performing in a play. We have invited 3,000 students from various higher secondary schools to witness this theatrical presentation with the hope that it will inspire youngsters to take up performing arts on a serious note,” said minister for art and culture,  .
 
 Penned by  , the play, with a pre-recorded voiceover by Gaude, has been recommended for the Asia Book of Records. Inspectors from the organisation will be present among the audience to judge the merits of the production during the grand staging.
 
 “The drama will be staged without a break and will be interspersed with music and dance to keep the tempo running. The animals are being handled by trained riders onstage,” Shinde said.
