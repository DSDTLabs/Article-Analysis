THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   told the assembly on Thursday that the government had not backtracked from the   proposed for Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram but was concerned about the government's financial liability. 

 "We have the example in  , which is now making huge losses," he said, while replying to a calling attention motion by Congress MLA   seeking urgent measures for realizing the project. The committee headed by the finance secretary is scrutinizing the project to find out the government's financial liability, he said.
 
 The government did not remove   from the project, he said, adding that the agency had moved out after its contract expired. "We have a metro now and we have the experience. The government will go ahead with the project," the CM said.
 
 He said that several changes were required in the project in accordance with the new 'metro policy' of the Central Government. "The committee will also look into the related documents submitted by the DMRC in this regard, and the final project report will be prepared and submitted to the Centre for approval," he added.
 
 The CM also informed the House that the government had already sanctioned 8.28 hectres of government land for the construction of depot/yard for the 13.33km Kozhikode light metro project. "Administrative sanction has also been given for release of Rs 272 crore for the construction of three flyovers which are part of the light metro project in Thiruvananthapuram," he said.
