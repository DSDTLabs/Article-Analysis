LUCKNOW: UP cabinet minister   has stirred a controversy by questioning the efficiency of administration in solving the Unnao rape case and claiming that the governance during previous   government was ‘very efficient’.

 
 Maurya had said that the CBI probe in the Unnao rape case involving   Kuldeep SiSwami Prasad Mauryangh Senger would not have arisen had the police acted promptly. He said that the former CM Mayawati kept a direct control on executive which worked much efficiently. “Woh abhi prashasan ke liye suvikhyat thi...(She was famous for her administration)’’ he said in an interview to a news channel on Tuesday.
 
 Even as his statement went viral, the minister on Wednesday came out with a clarification saying that the law and order situation during BSP regime was better than the previous SP government. He also said the ruling BJP government in UP too wants to establish a rule of law just like in case of the previous Mayawati government. “The law and order in BJP government is also good,’’ he insisted.
 
 Maurya maintained that apart the good governance he had also pointed out the shortcomings of Maya regime. “She was neck deep in corruption,” he added. The former BSP national general secretary had joined BJP in June 2016 while accusing Mayawati of drifting away from the principles of BR Ambedkar and selling tickets to party candidates.
 
 Earlier, an NDA ally and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar — who is also a cabinet mnister in   government — also openly criticised the state government accusing it of being corrupt and failing on the law and order front.
