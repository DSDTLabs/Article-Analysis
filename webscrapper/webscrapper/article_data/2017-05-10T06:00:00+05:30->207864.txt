Visakhapatnam: Mentioning that the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) is investing around Rs 2,500 crore for various development projects, port chairman MT Krishna Babu said around Rs 450 crore will be spent on expanding the port connectivity road from four lane to an eight-lane road. Participating in a trade and stakeholders meet organised by VPT here on Tuesday, Krishna Babu said the eight-lane road will include two service lanes on either side so that port traffic and commercial traffic can be segregated. “The project is being taken up under Bharatmala and land acquisition will be initiated soon. We expect the project to be to complete it another two-and-half-years,” he said. tnn
