MUMBAI: The   rose 232.6 points or 0.7% to close above the 32,000 milestone for the first time ever while the broader Nifty ended at 9,891.7 points, a 0.8% increase. Indices hit record highs on hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India on the back of low inflation. Global stock markets also provided some tailwind after a US Fed statement that eased fears of higher rates. 

 The sensex closed at its fifth record high in six trading sessions as a wave of liquidity lifted its constituent heavyweights like ITC, Reliance, Larsen & Toubro and ICICI Bank. FMCG stocks too have done well as GST has been beneficial for the sector. The market cap of BSE stocks rose to Rs 130 trillion.
 
 The fact that the market rally is being driven by a bunch of   stocks was quite evident on Thursday —1,455 stocks or 50.43% of the total declined on the BSE while only 1,278 scrips or 44.3% advanced during the day; 152 stocks or 5.27% remained unchanged. 
 
 The rise in markets on Thursday was also fuelled by FMCG and banking stocks. The BSE FMCG index soared about 1.6% and BSE Bankex rose 0.9%. “Momentum has been stoked by hopes of a rate cut given the lowered industrial output and softening inflation,” said Kunj Bansal, executive director & CIO, equity, Centrum Wealth Management. The retail inflation plunged to 1.5% in June. 
 
 “While recent macro data indicates weakness in the economy, the relatively smoother GST implementation has been taken positively by the markets,” said Vaibhav Agarwal, head, research, Angel Broking. Interestingly, the mid-cap and smallcaps stocks, which had a stellar run on the bourses, have fallen behind their large-cap peers over the past few months.
