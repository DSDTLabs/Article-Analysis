NAVI MUMBAI:   of sector 9,  , who have helped develop a   into a   will be hosting their annual   this Sunday. 

 Residents are invited to be part of an entertaining evening that will include ‘killa’ making, pebble art, origami and clay work, among others.
 
 The CBD Residents’ Agro Society was formed 15 years ago, after a struggle with the authorities over high tension wires in the area. 
 
 To ensure that the land is not misused by encroachers or illegal occupants, the residents got together and decided to develop the land using their own resources and skills. 
 
 By initiating activities such as facilitating the provision of well water for irrigation, cultivating fresh green vegetables and selling them among residents, opening up a Nana-Nani Park for senior citizens and carving out a football ground for youngsters, the society has managed to keep the area out of bounds for encroachers so far.
 
 “During this annual event we invite residents to take in the wonders of the garden, which is filled with lush flora and fauna, butterfly attracting plants, vegetable patch and designated play areas,” said Juee Khopkar, resident and one of the event organisers.
 
 A number of events have been planned, where both the adults and children can participate. 
 
 “Sector 9 doesn't have too many locals, so many residents from other nearby areas come to enjoy being part of the celebrations,” she added.
