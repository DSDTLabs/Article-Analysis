Vadodara: Heritage lovers in the city pressed the panic button on Tuesday when Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) began work on the dilapidated portion of the Tambekar Wada behind the part that is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).  VMC officials claimed that a lot of dirt had gathered in the dilapidated portion. During the effort to clean it, it also came to light that a part of this portion was also dangerous and was falling apart. It was decided to remove it and begin a complete restoration of the structure. The ASI team also rushed to the site hearing about the development. Sources in ASI said that Tambekar Wada, which is one of the oldest surviving residential complexes of the city constructed in 1874 is divided into four parts. Only the front portion of the large complex is protected by the ASI while the rest of the three portions including the highly run-down backside of the wada, are under VMC’s possession. “However, if VMC demolishes any portion of the complex, it will naturally have an adverse impact on the protected portion of the complex as the entire complex is one structure,” an ASI official said.  Anil Tiwari, superintending archaeologist of ASI Vadodara circle, who had a meeting with VMC officials, told TOI that he has asked the corporation officials not to carry out any demolition activity at the complex. “I have personally visited the spot. There is one portion which has already collapsed. The corporation is presently cleaning up the space. But I have asked them not to carry out any demolition,” Tiwari told TOI. VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the claims that the dilapidated portion would be razed were absolutely false.  “I had visited the site personally and it is in an extremely bad condition with a part of it already collapsed. We plan to clean it and restore it. If needed, we will also take help from the ASI for the work,” he said.
