 Madurai: Directing the state’s health secretary to inquire whether ineligible people were given appointment to work under the Tamil Nadu State   Control Society (Tansacs), the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday said the secretary can take up the issue to the director general of department of AIDS control organisation, if the need arose. 
 
 A division bench of justices K K Sasidharan and G R Swaminathan gave this direction on a petition filed by D Roopsingh Robinson Rajkumar from Madurai. The petitioner told the court that the past and present project directors of Tansacs appointed many people who did not having requisite qualifications as prescribed in NACO (National Aids Control Organisation) in Tansacs’ various wings like ICTC, blood bank STI clinic, ART centres and district AIDS prevention and control unit in the state.
 
 “Since the issue that ineligible people have been employed and are being paid salary out of the public funds has been raised, we deem it fit and proper, to give a direction to the health secretary to enquire into the representation and pass orders on merits and in accordance with law within two months from the receipt of order copy. If the secretary comes to a conclusion that the director general of department of AIDS control organisation would have to be involved, it is certainly open to the secretary to take up the matter with the director general,” the bench said.
 
 The petitioner also said that Tansacs was not following the mandatory rule to submit its annual report for the past 16 years. It extended some posts, which were abolished by NACO and paid salaries to those people concerned. 
 
 Regarding that, a representation was given to officials concerned on several occasions in the past. The last one was given on February 6. But, there was no action on it. Hence, it was necessary to order certificate verification and to remove ineligible candidates, the petitioner said.
