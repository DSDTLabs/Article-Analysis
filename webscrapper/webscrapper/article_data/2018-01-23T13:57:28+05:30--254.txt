Tirupur: Farmers on Monday attempted to extract neera from coconut trees in various places at   and   taluks to protest ‘impractical’ rules for tapping the drink.

 The rural police, however, destroyed the pots used for extracting the coconut drink and registered cases against the farmers under the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937. Subsequently, a section of farmers affiliated to   staged a protest at Tirupur north taluk office in the evening.
 
 Last year, the state government allowed neera tapping, but with many restrictions. “As per the rules, farmers cannot tap neera and sell it individually. There should be an association to procure the coconut extract and process it before selling the beverage in the market. It will take Rs 3-Rs 12 crore to set up a processing company. But most farmers are not in a position to make such a big investment. Hence, they are opposing the government fiat,” A S  , Coimbatore district president of Katchi Saarbatra Tamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam, told TOI.
 
 “The procuring concept will work against the farmers’ interests. For instance, milk is procured at Rs 25 per litre from farmers and sold in the market for twice the price. So, we should be allowed to tap and sell neera individually. If needed, the authorities can test the quality and nature of the product,” Babu said.
 
 As per the government rule, licence of the company can be cancelled if neera turns into toddy through fermentation process. “There is insecurity among the farmers,” Babu further said.
 
 A large number of police personnel were deployed in many coconut farms to foil farmers’ bid to tap neera. Besides destroying pots used to extract the drink, they also cut inflorescence of the trees. “Even before the government released guidelines for tapping neera, farmers were extracting it without any permission. Since it was unlawful, we registered cases against them,” district SP E S   said.
