CHANDRAPUR/NAGPUR: Two leopards were found dead in separate incidents on Sunday. While one leopard died in   after getting entangled in wire snares laid for herbivores, another died near Katlabodi, 35kms from Nagpur.

 A full grown leopardess was trapped in wire-snares inside Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS). The carcass was found in a nullah inside   compound wall on Sunday morning.
 
 The carcass was first noticed by commuters near Koyna gate. Forest officials and CSTPS security staff later rushed to the spot and found the carcass laying half submerged in turgid water.
 
 The leopardess was trapped at waist and apparently died struggling to free itself. Divisional forest officer (DFO), Chandrapur, Raju Dhabekar said poachers might have laid wire snares for wild boars but the carnivore got trapped.
 
 Veterinary wildlife officer of   carried out post-mortem which confirmed the animal died due to drowning. Body was later incinerated at the rescue centre. An offence has been registered against unidentified poachers.
 
 In the second incident, a full grown leopardess was found dead in   in compartment number 16 near Katlabodi in Kondhali range.
 
 The carcass was lying in the forest for five days. Honorary district wildlife warden Kundan Hate, who reached the spot with wildlife veterinarian Dr GM Kadu, said it may be a territorial fight with resident tiger.
 
 “On a nearby tree, claw marks of the leopardess are seen and it is quite possible that the carnivore must have tried to climb tree top. The skin of the animal was seen damaged at two places. Other body parts are intact,” said Hate.
 
 However, samples have been collected and will be sent for forensic tests. The carcass was later burned in presence of assistant conservator of forests (ACF) SN Kshirsagar and RFO Pramod Humne.
