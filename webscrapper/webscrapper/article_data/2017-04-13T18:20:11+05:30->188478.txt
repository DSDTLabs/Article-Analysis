PILIBHIT: Around 150 contractual beat watchers of Pilibhit tiger reserve who   from criminals and intruders raised their voice against   of their wages for five months.
 
  The staff members met PTR divisional forest officer Kailash   and put forward their demands. They also gave an ultimatum to the official that they will begin a fast unto death if their dues were not cleared soon.
  
  They also alleged that they were made to carry out duty of guarding forest areas 24x7 instead of assigned eight hours. They claimed that the PTR had been allocated around Rs 7.5 crore under its annual plan, but no official was concerned about the payment of their wages.
  
  DFO   told TOI, “The fund for making payments to beat watchers is contributed by the Union as well as the state governments in equal ratio. The Union government had already transferred its share to the state but the state government failed to allocate its own 50% share. The fund is still pending at the end of Lucknow.”
  
  He said that the requisition for fund to make payments to beat watchers had already been sent to the state forest administration. “We will clear off all the dues of beat watchers as soon as we receive the money,” Prakash said.
