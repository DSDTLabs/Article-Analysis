Most buses were off the roads on Friday and commuters fell back on suburban trains and the metro rail to reach work and head back home. Senior railway officials said there was unprecedented rush at   and Chennai Central, but they were prepared.

 “Supervisors were asked to be on their toes,” a senior official said.   trains were packed to the rafters during peak hours and additional counters were opened to handle the rush. Officials said there was a 15% increase in the number of passengers.
 
 
 Officials said trains were not crowded between 11am and 3pm, but after 4:30pm, when the office crowd started returning home, people could be seen dangling from the doors of trains.
 
 By late in the night, more than 32,750 people had taken metro trains, at least 10,000 more than the usual number.
 
 “I usually take the bus to go to work at Ekkattuthangal. Luckily, there are metro stations close to my home and my office and that saved my day,” said Dinesh Kumar, a techie from Aminjikarai.
 
 The suburban trains, which usually become empty at Avadi and Ennore, were crowded till the last stop. Trains on the Arakkonam section were crowded since a signal failure delayed trains. “There was an announcement at Tiruvallur station regarding the delay,” said K Baskar, a resident.
 
 Metro rail officials expect the numbers to go further up if the strike continues. “We already saw close to our average ridership by afternoon. We expect more crowd to walk in if the strike continues. We are ready and equipped to handle it,” an official said. At present, metro rail operates on three stretchesover 28km --- Koyambedu to Alandur, Little Mount to Airport and Nehru Park to Thirumangalam.
