 Almost the entire Hollywood industry turned up at the event which was dubbed as an engagement party to reportedly keep the paparazzi off the venue. The event was attended by Hollywood's A-listers including Chris Martin's ex Jennifer Aniston, director Steven Spielberg, and actresses Kate Hudson,  , Julia Roberts, Liv Tyler, Reese Witherspoon, Demi Moore, and Chelsea Handler.
 
 Aniston wore a floor-length black gown and wore a wrist brace on her left arm. Paltrow and Falchuk met when the actress guest-starred on Glee in 2010 and the pair have been dating since 2014, after her split.
