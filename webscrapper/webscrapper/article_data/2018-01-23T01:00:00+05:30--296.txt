 I have been living in Mumbai for more than six months now. And in this short span of time, Mumbai has left an indelible mark on my personality and life. I have fallen in love with this melting pot of cultures where I find great paradoxes and little joys at every turn. Mumbaikars are the most accepting people I have ever met. What I also love about the city is that it is culturally diverse and welcomes people belonging to any religion or region with open arms. Mumbai is one of those cities that loves its street food — from the delicious chaat and pani puri at the corner of the street, to the vada pav that can beat the burgers from any fast-food joints... And I need not mention that the city truly never sleeps. Even at 1 am, you will still find yourself stuck in the traffic.
 
 I like to walk down   with the cool breeze brushing my hair, have my favourite chaat at Juhu Chowpatty or go on a picnic to Aksa beach, which is outstanding! This city has given me a chance to explore myself with a bunch of awesome friends.
 However, I wish that in this fast-paced city life, we can find a place where I can just sit and relax with my bunch of friends. The hectic life of Mumbai is sometimes extremely difficult to catch up with.”
