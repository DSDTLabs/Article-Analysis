Mysuru: Students of the city-based Yuvaraja’s College boycotted class and staged a protest on Thursday urging the University of Mysore to extend basic facilities like drinking water and   at the college. 

 The college has over 3,000 students, the lack of basic amenities such as restrooms for women, coupled with poorly maintained  , comes as a shock to many. The laboratories lack power supply and cleanliness has not been maintained throughout the college campus. “Despite bringing these problems to the notice of the UoM administration, we have received no response. This is a struggle that has been going on for a year and a half. We want the principal of the college to be dismissed,” the students said. 
 
 “During the summer, students require drinking water at the college. But the administration asks the students to get drinking water from our home. Water to drink is fine, but can students fetch water for toilets as well,”asked Surabhi, a student.
 
 That there are just five lavatoires on the campus for a student strength of over 3,000 indicates the gravity of the problem. “Those toilets lack water supply. As the toilets are located adjacent to classrooms, students find it difficult to bear the smell. It is not just the case with girl’s washroom but for boys as well. At times, students have to go to the canteen, library or Maharaja’s College for proper toilets,” Surabhi added.
 
 Since the beginning of semester, the laboratories lack water supply because of which, most of the labs have been called off. Water has been fetched from other places in order to run the laboratories. Power supply is a major concern. With growing dirtiness in the campus, there is rise in mosquitoes which also pose a threat to students, Yashwanth added.
 
 Registrar D Bharathi who arrived at the spot listened to the grievances of the students and promised of resolving the issues in a week.
