KOLKATA: Bidhannagar Commissionerate has come up with smarter ways to check on those who hit the gas without keeping an eye on the speedometers on Rajarhat Expressway — the longest and widest expressway.

 Cops are soon going to install roadside speed indicators, like those on the city flyovers and speed corridors like Red Road, Hospital Road and EM Bypass. A first in the Bidhannagar Commissionerate area, the speed indicators will read the speed at which a car is travelling and show it on a digital board put up on the roadside.
 
 “There will be 4-5 such cameras and indicators along the entire length of the expressway between Mahisbathan and Chinar Park. The stretch in front of Eco Park, City Centre II and Nazrul Tirtha are some of the selected spots,” said a senior officer at Bidhannagar Comimissionerate. More such indicators will be put up at other key stretches under the commissionerate’s area like VIP Road and Keshtopur flyover.
 
 Officers of the commissionerate along with representatives of   and Hidco initiated a traffic survey recently and suggested a slew of measures for Rajarhat Expressway. The measures include installation of smart speed cameras, subways and speed breakers with reflectors for some of the traffic-heavy lanes and bylanes and digital indicators and signages across the township.
 
 “Among the measures suggested, we have already approved the construction of subways at the four corners of the Kolkata Gate. There has been demand for more subways, especially at the   bus stand crossing, near   No 5 and near City Centre
 
 2. We are working on those,” said a senior Hidco official.
 
 The official also said that they have approved the need for installation of smart speed cameras and the first one will soon be put up on the road in front of Nazrul Tirtha. “Once the first camera is tested, we will get more for the rest of the expressway,” said the official.
