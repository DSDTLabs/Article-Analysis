PANCHKULA: The   of   has gone the ‘Padman’ way to provide sanitary pads to the women who cannot afford it. To make this process easy, the officials of the civic department have installed sanitary napkin vending machines at four places in the city.

 According to the information given by a technical team of the municipal corporation, the vending machines have been installed at both the   offices -- Sector 14 and Sector 4.
 
 The officials have stated that the machine had been installed in collaboration with a private firm free of cost. “The user needs to put a Rs 10 coin to fetch a sanitary pad from the machine. The machine will automatically dispense a pad out of it,” the MC officials.
 
 The officials further stated that as the testing of the machines has been done, they are now planning to install these machines at various public toilets.
 
 “More such machines will be installed at the public places to provide the facility to the women,” said executive officer O P Sihag.
 
 He said that the MC got this idea from the Bollywood movie ‘Padman’ and wanted to do something for the women in the city.
 
 The facility, as of now, is only available at the municipal corporation office and women have started using the facility, told officials.
