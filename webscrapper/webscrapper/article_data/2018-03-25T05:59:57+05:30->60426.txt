AHMEDABAD: Special Crime Branch (SCB) of the   (CBI) Mumbai has registered an FIR for the kidnapping of a girl, Jaladhi, 16 when she went missing, and a resident of CT Mill Compound in Kankaria. She had mysteriously disappeared in October 2014 . The Gujarat   had directed the   to register an FIR based on the plea of her parents that the   investigation did not reveal anything for three years.

 Justice   had ordered the CBI to immediately take over the probe and trace Jaladhi’s whereabouts as soon as possible.
 
 Considering the case history the court also noted, “It seems prima facie a case of human trafficking. The investigation should be taken up soon by the CBI very seriously. One does not know in what condition the daughter of the applicant must be as on date. One is not sure whether she is alive or has been killed. She might have been forced into prostitution, etc”
 
 Jaladhi has not been found since 2014 despite the HC ordering state CID to trace her. After nearly two years, when CID told the court that it had made all efforts to trace the girl, Justice J B Pardiwala refused to buy their claims.
 
 Jaladhi and her friend Neha went missing on October 4, 2014. Neha returned four days later, but did not reveal anything about the mysterious disappearance of Jaladhi, who has not returned yet. Her parents approached cops, and later filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court. The HC ordered CID to probe the case, but the family did not notice any development for three years.
 
 The family moved the HC again and demanded CBI probe. The HC said, “This is something very serious and I am not satisfied with the report placed on record to show that all possible steps are being taken to find the  .” Senior CBI sources said they will soon be camping in Ahmedabad and make every effort to trace the girl. “We will first have to gather documents related to the case and translate them to English,” said a senior CBI official.
