HYDERABAD: Nabbing  , ruling TRS leader from Mahadevpur, along with  , another accused in the March 19   is a priority,   deputy superintendent of police KRK   said. 

 The police will soon launch an investigation into how N Sathyanarayana, one of the three arrested in the case so far and who surrendered his 'sporting rifle', managed to accumulate 150 rounds of ammunition. "It is not possible to buy bullets by the kilo. We will definitely find out how he got so much of the ammunition," a senior police official said. 
 
 Meanwhile, a government source disclosed that it has now been established that there was deliberate laxity on the part of some officers in the two days after the poaching that complicated the search for the accused now. It may be recalled that police and forest department officials had previously admitted to moles within their departments assisting the poachers. Other police officers from police stations neighbouring Mahadevpur have now been brought in on the investigation in a bid to keep these moles away from active investigation of the case, it is learnt.
