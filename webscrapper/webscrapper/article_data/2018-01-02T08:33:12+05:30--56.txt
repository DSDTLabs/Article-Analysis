HYDERABAD: After a gap of 10 years,   is all set to get a second major park. The park, spread over four acres at Kishanbagh in the heart of Old City, is being developed by the   ( ).

 Till date, the only major park in Old City is at Imliban, which was developed on seven acres in 2007. A few other parks have come up in areas close to Old City such as IS Sadan, Saidabad, Malakpet and Rajendranagar. Due to vast and unchecked development, Old City has been deprived of lung space and officials cited the dense population there to justify the absence of such parks. The new one at Kishanbagh should provide some breather to its residents.
 
 As there are no recreational facilities in Old City, people either go to Imliban or Zoo Park. Now, this new Kishanbagh Park is expected to attract residents of over 120 colonies and habitation in Kishanbagh and Bahadurpura areas. “The park that is being developed at a cost of Rs 6.20 crore will be thrown open to the general public this month,” GHMC zonal commissioner (SZ) S Srinivas Reddy told TOI.
 
 With great difficulty, the GHMC converted the four-acre unauthorised garbage dumpyard and open defecation point into a recreational facility. The park will have all kinds of facilities, including walk track, seating gallery, illumination, internal and external pathways, children’s play area and greenery. “We have also provided a compost pit to utilise the waste generated at the park,” he said.
 
 “Apart from focusing on major parks, GHMC would redevelop colony parks in various areas. Residential welfare associations are being involved for development and maintenance of parks,” an official from the urban biodiversity wing said.
 
 The civic body has so far developed 17 major parks, 17 theme parks, 786 colony parks, 10 biodiversity parks, 428 tree parks, 12 institutional parks and 17 lake parks in the past few years.
