CHANDIGARH: Adding a new twist to the controversy over his remark that five Canadian ministers were   sympathisers, Punjab chief minister   on Thursday offered full security and protocol to visiting Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan but ruled out any meeting with him. Amarinder said that he stood by his ‘principled stand’ of not associating himself with any ‘Khalistani sympathiser’.

 “Sajjan is welcome to attend conferences and meets and even visit the Golden Temple, but I will personally not entertain the Canadian minister as I have concrete information about his being a Khalistani sympathiser, just as his father  , a board member of the World Sikh Organization, was,” he said.
 
 “The state government will provide full security to the minister and also ensure that he gets due treatment as per protocol,” he pointed out. The chief minister said he was neither worried about Candian government’s counter claims on the antecedents and associations of their five Sikh ministers nor he was concerned about the critics within India on his remarks against the minister. “Sajjan and several other ministers and top leaders in Canada have been sympathising with those indulging in anti-India activities,” he maintained.
 
 “As a democratic nation India believes in the freedom of speech, which was enshrined in the Constitution and I will personally not meet any Khalistani sympathisers,” he added. “As many as 35,000 innocent lives were lost during those days of violence,” he said, add ing that people like “Sajjan had not only run away from the turmoil to settle abroad but were encouraging such extremist elements by supporting their philosophy. Not only Sajjan, but other ministers and MPs, including Navdeep Bains, Amarjit Sohi, Sukh Dhaiwal, Darshan Kang, Raj Grewal, Harinder Malhi, Roby Sahota, Jagmeet Singh and Randeep Sari, were known for their leanings towards the Khalistani movement,” he added.
