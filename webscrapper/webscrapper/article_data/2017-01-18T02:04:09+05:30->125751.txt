Mumbai: Nearly 2,000   (more than half of the fleet) are being examined for   at 27 depots across Mumbai after Sunday’s incident in which a bus caught fire at Andheri east. 

 This could affect the regular frequency of buses for next few days, said sources.
 
 Officials said that the CNG pipe developed a “leak”, which resulted in the blaze. “I have directed my staff to examine every CNG bus, specially those which are similar to the one that caught fire on Sunday,” said BEST general manager Jagdish Patil. Patil claimed that the bus maintenance had “improved” in recent months as every vehicle was being thoroughly checked before it left the depot. “Bus breakdowns have come down significantly and this shows that our maintenance is improving,” he said.
 
 BEST committee members, however, rubbished this claim, alleging that the fire incident clearly indicated that maintenance of buses was “poor”. “Such incidents have occurred in the past and the former GMs had assured the committee that there will be better maintenance. But Sunday’s incident on Sunday has belied these claims,” said   member Ravi Raja.
