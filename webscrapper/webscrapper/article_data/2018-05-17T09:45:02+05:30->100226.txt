PANAJI: After successfully hosting the   World Cup last year, the   ( ) has suggested to Fifa that they are keen to host the next edition of the U-20   in 2020.

 
 
 “We are examining the possibility of bidding for the U-20 Women’s World Cup in 2020. If you look at the Fifa U-17 World Cup, it gave such a fillip for the game in the country, and we expect the (U-20) Women’s World Cup to do the same for women’s football,” said AIFF general secretary  .
 
 India had in fact made a pitch for the U-20 World Cup (men’s) in 2019 but Fifa were in no mood to give India another World Cup within two years and instead handpicked Poland as hosts.
 
 The women’s U-20 World Cup, though, is a different ball game and there are indications Fifa won’t have the same reservations when they meet to decide the hosts.
 
 “Details on the bidding process will follow in due course,” a Fifa spokesperson told TOI.
 
 The 2018 edition of the U-20 Women’s World Cup will be played in France, which also hosts the Women’s World Cup next year.
 
 India’s push for big tournaments stems from the infrastructure that is already available.
