HUBBALI: A teacher who was upset with students in her class sporting long hair, finally took action: she brought a pair of scissors and snipped off their hair. All in an attempt to discipline the boys. 

 But this did not go down well with the parents of some students of Government Adarsh School, Hunshyal village of   in Vijayapura district. Some objected to the teacher's act, but there were also others who appreciated her for disciplining their young sons.
 
 Sridevi B Davalagi, English teacher, said:"I have been warning some boys in Class 8 for a few days now to trim their hair. But they continued to attend class with long hair streaked with red, yellow and other colours. This trend spread, and students of Class 5 and 6 started imitating them. Monday was their deadline to cut hair," she said.
 
 On Monday, the boys were back, and so was their hair. "So during the class, I snipped off the hair of some with a scissor, but without insulting them," said Sridevi.
 
  SDMC chairman   said they have sorted out the issue after a few parents complained against the teacher.
