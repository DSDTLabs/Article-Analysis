BHOPAL:   Regulartory Authority (RERA), a newly constituted government agency that ensures fair property deal for consumers, will come into effect from May 1. But, experts feel that the authority coupled with Goods and   ( ) from July is likely to jack up property prices in the state capital by 15%.

 Under RERA, a builder has to comply with various conditions, which have been framed keeping in mind the interest of buyers, while the GST would increase cost of raw material, the burden of which will ultimately be borne by the consumers. 
 
 However, in a relief for builders, the property market, as of now, is showing signs of improvement. Real estate was in a slump post-demonetisation and the prices had dipped by almost 40%. After waiting for prices to drop further, the buyers, mostly the end users, are again evincing interest in putting their hard-earned money in the market. The builders pointed out there is no possibility of prices to decline further, as it has already touched the bottom.
 
 Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI) Bhopal president Wasiq Husain said the market is improving. There are around 200 under-construction projects in the city. RERA is a welcome move, as it will improve transparency in the market. CREDAI keeps interacting with the government regarding real estate policies to improve the property market, he added. RERA is expected to come into effect from May 1. A builder has to get himself registered with full project details and would be held responsible in case of any delays. He will have to deliver exactly what he has promised.
 
 CREDAI spokesman Manoj Singh Meek said RERA and GST will ultimately lead to increase in the cost of projects. The prices are expected to go up by 15 per cent.
