 The budget provides Rs 5.50 crore for promoting mechanised farming. An interest-free loan of Rs 2.60 crore will be given for dairy farmers for buying cattle. 
 
 The important recommendations in the budget include ‘Life mission project’ of the state government aimed at houses for all, financial aid for panchayats for establishing roadside leisure spots, promoting inland water tourism, programmes for cancer prevention with the help of ayurveda, homoeopathy and allopathy departments and financial aid for the welfare of differently-abled persons.
 
 However, the opposition slammed the budget saying that it was mere a repetition of the last years' budget.
