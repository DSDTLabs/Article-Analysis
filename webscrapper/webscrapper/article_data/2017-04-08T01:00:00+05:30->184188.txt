Summer is all about going cool and flowing and   make for the right cut. The loose-fitted garment offers lots of volume and movement and is usually worn calf length. A throwback to the 70’s, the culotte is big on the international ramp this season. While it’s not form-fitting, you can still make this feminine   hybrid flattering for you.

 
 
 
 
 While both are a summer staple, there’s a difference between culottes and capris. The former gives a looser fit while the latter is more snug.
 
 Culottes are also called gauchos or wide-leg pants. Technically it is is any garment, which may appear loose like a skirt, but actually has two separate leg openings, just like trousers. People often mistake culottes for a skort — a combination of a skirt and pair of shorts.
