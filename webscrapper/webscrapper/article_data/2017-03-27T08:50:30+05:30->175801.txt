MUMBAI: Police have finally registered an FIR accusing a   of rapeing a class IV  . Law-enforcement officials swung into action after the crime branch's women's cell gave a report confirming the 29-year-old survivor's allegations.

 Last month, the woman had lodged a complaint with the police commissioner, alleging that constable Tushar Tirude had raped her on several occasions at gunpoint and threatened her with dire consequences.
 
 The police commissioner had directed the crime branch to probe the complaint. “As the incident took place in Sion, we have handed over the investigations to the local police station,“ said an officer. The police have booked Tirude under Indian Penal Code sections of raping, threatening and causing grievous hurt.
 
 The woman alleged that Tirude went to the extent of getting her complaint suppressed and ensured that the Bhoiwada police station did not entertain her. The woman alleged that in 2013, her husband got married to another woman without divorcing her. She told the police that she was introduced to Tirude when she went to lodge a complaint against her husband. Under the pretext of helping her, Tirude went to her house and raped her at gunpoint. The survivor claimed that she became pregnant and underwent two abortions.
