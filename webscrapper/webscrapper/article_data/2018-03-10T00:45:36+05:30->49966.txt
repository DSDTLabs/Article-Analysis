An FIR has been registered for cheating against 11   of Bambawad village who had allegedly remarried at a mass wedding for the sake of government gifts and cash but no action has been taken against the panchayat chief who is accused of luring the couples. The villagers alleged that some of them had been targeted. “All the families are poor and they participated in the mass wedding on being influenced by the pradhan. But no action has been taken against the pradhan. Is law only for the poor?” asked Mukesh, a villager. DM B N Singh said an FIR would be lodged against the pradhan if his involvement was established in an investigation done by chief development officer Anil Kumar Singh.
