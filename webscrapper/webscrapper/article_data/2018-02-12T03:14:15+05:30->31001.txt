NEW DELHI: Two bike-borne   thought they had successfully managed to flee with a man’s mobile phone in southeast Delhi’s New Friends Colony on Saturday evening. Their happiness was, however, limited to only 30 minutes as the owner of the phone took upon himself to recover his phone. Ramsevak (24) searched the entire area riding pillion to a   delivery   and managed to get his phone back.

 Ramsevak told cops that the incident took place when he was going back home from a friend’s place. “As I was walking, two bike-borne men came from behind and snatched the phone from my hand.”
 
 As the accused fled, Ramsevak saw a pizza   boy and asked for his help. The duo quickly decided to search the area in which the snatchers had sped towards.
 
 Ramsevak soon saw the snatchers waiting at a traffic signal. He ran towards the accused and nabbed the man sitting pillion. The other accused, however, managed to escape. The stolen phone was recovered from the pillion rider’s possession.
 
 The accused was identified as Mohammad Jia (30), a resident of Okhla Vihar. Cops are scanning the CCTV footage to ascertain the identity of the other snatcher. 
 
 DCP (southeast) Chinmoy Biswal lauded Ramsevak’s valiant effort and said that he would be suitably rewarded.
