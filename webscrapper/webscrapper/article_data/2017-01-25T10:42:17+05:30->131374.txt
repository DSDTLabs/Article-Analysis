PUNE: Expect to see fewer   boards in the coming days.

 Over the last 15 days, there has been a dramatic improvement in cash supply at ATMs in and around the city, bankers and cash management logistics players told TOI on Tuesday. Further, they said “situation will be very close to normal by mid-February”. 
 
 “About 70% of our ATMs are working now,” Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager for resource planning,  , said. 
 
 A city-based cooperative bank said the situation is about 75% normal now. “We are able to allocate cash for ATMs as well as branches and to other cooperative banks,” Milind Kale, chairman,  , said. 
 
 The bankers said the availability of Rs 500 denomination notes has also improved considerably now. In fact, a senior banker said the worry now is that digital transaction values and volumes are falling because cash is back in circulation.
 
 Cash management logistics company Logicash’s CEO Vipin Jain said the firm is receiving 90% of the indent from the currency chests to fill the ATMs. “Out of 15,000 ATMs we operate across India, we are able to fill up 12,000 to 13,000 regularly. We are not filling up all the ATMs to the fullest since we did not do it earlier either,” he said. 
 
  In the Kalyaninagar and Wadgaonsheri areas, all ATMs opened last week, but according to the security guards at these kiosks, “replenishment is still not as regular as before”.
 
 “Cash arrived on Thursday and it got over by Friday evening. But there has not been any dispatch of cash by the agency since then,” Manish Singh, a security guard at an ATM in Chandannagar, said.
 
 Dhayari resident Suraj Kalokhe, while pointing to a nearby ATM, said: “The supply of cash at this ATM got normalized slowly after January 5. However, the cash gets exhausted soon after it is replenished.”
