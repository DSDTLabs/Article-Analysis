Panaji: The fifth edition of the Goa Environmental Film Festival (GEFF) is being held from September 8 to 10 at Kala Academy, Panaji. 

 This time, the festival theme is pollution. The Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) has partnered with the GEFF team to organise the three-day festival this year.
 
 “Pollution is one of the major hurdles in sustainable development and a contributor to the degradation of our environment. Various verticals like solid waste, sound, light, water and more are directly or indirectly responsible for different levels of pollution which in turn leads to wastage of useful natural resources,” said ESG vice-chairman Rajendra Talak.
 
 Festival organisers have announced a contest with three categories: schools, colleges and individual category. Rules state that film entries should be in Konkani, Marathi, Hindi or English; produced by Goan producers/production houses, students studying in Goa and educational and social institutions only. Duration of the short films can vary from 3-10 minutes.
 
 Award-winning films will be screened and prizes will be distributed during the three-day festival. The eligibility criteria and application forms for the same are available on www.esg.co.in under ‘Goa Environmental Film Festival 2017’. Interested persons can register on or before August 5 and submit the forms at the ESG office, Panaji. The results for the same will be announced on September 8.
