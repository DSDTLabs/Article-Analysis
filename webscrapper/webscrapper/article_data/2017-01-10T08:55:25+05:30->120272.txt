NEW DELHI: A leading global think tank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has recommended putting in place a formal doctrine or emergency plan and developing standard operating procedures to facilitate evacuation of expatriates from  .
 
  The India chapter of the Washington, D.C., headquartered think tank released ‘India's Expatriate Evacuation Operations’, the first comprehensive report of its kind, ahead of the mega diaspora show   that was held in Bengaluru.
  
  In the report, the think tank has made recommendations including training and preparing diplomatic corps and military personnel, and establishment of a permanent coordinating mechanism among various government departments at national and international level for a smooth evacuation of expats.
  
  “India has extensive experience in conducting evacuation operations…As India’s diaspora continues to grow, so will be challenges New Delhi faces in protecting this diverse and geographically diverse and geographically dispersed population. To overcome these issues, the Indian government will have to institutionalise best practices, bolster its diplomatic and military capabilities, and improve coordination,”  , a fellow with Carnegie India, wrote in the report.
  
 Successive Indian governments including the incumbent BJP-led NDA regime have conducted more than 30 evacuation operations across  ,   and Europe since 1990, including the largest ever civilian airlift of 110,000 people from   in 1990.
  
  About 20 million Indians travel abroad annually and another 11 million Indians reside overseas.
