NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday took suo moto cognizance of alleged rape of a woman inside a moving cab that didn’t have the mandatory global positioning system ( ).

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar cited a TOI report on the September 12 incident and slammed the   and transport departments for failing to enforce safety of passengers.
 
 “The report points out that Delhi traffic police and police authorities are unable to control grave violation of norms by taxi drivers in Delhi resulting in serious crimes including sexual violence against passengers,” the bench observed, while referring to the incident where the driver of a black and yellow taxi allegedly offered lift to a woman and then sexually assaulted her.
 
 The court further observed that though to operate in the capital, taxi drivers require commercial licences, special permits and adherence to multiple safety standards, these “norms are openly flouted”.
 
 Saying that the matter requires HC’s intervention, the court ordered the Centre, Delhi government, city police and the transport departments of both state and Union governments to file responses on non-enforcement of laws and rules, which were being violated by taxi drivers.
 
 It also ordered that the victim should be provided with immediate legal aid and compensation and posted the case for next hearing on September 20.
 
 The report had said a 30-year-old taxi driver was arrested for allegedly raping a 23-year-old woman at a park near Red Fort on September 12. The woman had alleged that Chunnu Kumar raped her on the pretext of dropping her to a bus stand from where she could go to Ludhiana.
 
 HC, quoting the report underlined that practice of operating shared taxis was common around railway stations. The taxi in question did not have a GPS-based fare meter, which was made mandatory by the   but faced stiff resistance from autorickshaw and taxi unions.
