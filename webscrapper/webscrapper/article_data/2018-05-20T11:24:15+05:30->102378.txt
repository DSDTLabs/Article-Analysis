BENGALURU: All’s well that ends well. Relief was writ large on the faces of   and JD(S) MLAs after the three-day long political drama ended in an anticlimax of sorts.

 
 The MLAs, who arrived in Bengaluru from Hyderabad just hours before the crucial assembly session began on Saturday, initially appeared tense and nervous. But all that faded soon after they entered the assembly hall in Vidhana Soudha.
 
 “When we arrived inside the house, we realized that all our MLAs were intact and together, and the   had no chance to prove its majority,” said some Congress and JD(S) MLAs, expressing their joy.
 
 On Friday night, they had all been moved out to Hyderabad in buses to evade poaching by the BJP, within hours of the   ordering chief minister   to complete the trust vote on Saturday.
 
 They were forced to take the 600km road route, despite the availability of chartered flights, after airport authorities denied them permission to fly, citing technical issues.
 
 After the MLAs arrived in Bengaluru, they were allowed to share pleasantries with waiting family members. While Congress legislators were put up at the Hilton, near  , JD (S) legislators freshened up at Le Meridien, before arriving at Vidhana Soudha.
 
 The two missing MLAs – Anand Singh and Prathapgouda Patil— arrived in Vidhana Soudha just 15 minutes before the scheduled trust vote. They looked tense throughout their stay in the house, and left soon after Yeddyurappa announced his resignation.
 
 But it was still not over for the two parties. Congress MLAs were shifted back to the Hilton, and JD (S) MLAs to Le Meridien, ahead of the trust vote for the H D Kumaraswamy government, some time next week. Congress MLAs are likely to be shifted to Eagleton resort near Bidadi later in the night.
