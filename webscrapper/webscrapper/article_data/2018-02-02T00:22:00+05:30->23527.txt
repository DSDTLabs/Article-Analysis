Pune: A 70-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday for raping a mentally challenged minor girl in Lonikand. The incident came to light around 10 days ago. But as the girl was not able to provide details about the suspect, it took some time for the Pune rural police to crack the case.  The probe revealed that the suspect used to rape the girl on the pretext of offering her sweets. He has been charged under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. An officer of the Pune rural police told TOI that the 16-year-old girl was mentally challenged. She cannot speak properly. Her parents are labourers. They used leave the girl alone in home when they went out for work, the officer said. He said the girl’s parents took her to a government hospital on January 22 as she was not feeling well. “They were shocked to find their daughter two months’ pregnant,” the officer said. The parents immediately approached the police and lodged a complaint against an unidentified person. “It was difficult for the police to crack the case as the girl was not able to provide details about the suspect,” the officer said. He said a woman police officer met the girl daily and tried to talk to her. “After gaining her confidence, the policewoman asked the girl about the person who came to her house when her parents were not at home. While speaking with the girl, the suspicion of the police turned towards her neighbour,” the officer said.  The police took the suspect into custody. During sustained interrogation, he admitted to have raped the girl when she was alone at home.
