Panaji: In the near future, citizens of the state will be able to register their vehicles and apply for licenses from the comfort of their homes. The state government will soon adopt the Union ministry’s online system, the citizen-centric application Vahan 4.0 and Sarathi 4.0 aimed at simplifying the issuance process and going digital.

 Across the country, 85 road transport offices under Vahan 4.0 and 235 road transport offices under Sarathi 4.0 have been brought to the centralized platform, which includes Goa.
 
 Both these applications are upgradations of the existing systems - Vahan 2.0 and Sarathi 2.0 - at the state department’s RTOs.
 
 The Union ministry had entrusted National Informatics Centre (NIC) the task of standardizing and deploying the softwares - Vahan for vehicle registration and Sarathi for driving licenses and compilation of data - in both the state and national register.
 
 The applications were, however, only used at the office level by transport officials. The upgraded version 4.0 will be open to public domain. It will link the department with vehicle dealers and citizens wishing to apply to RTOs for various purposes.
 
 “With the help of this software, the database of Goa can be viewed at the central server in Delhi. The ministry of road transport and highways is thus going to monitor the state’s transport activities from the centre,” a transport official told TOI.
