LUCKNOW:   ( ) has decided to break the tradition of asking for donations on its chief Mayawati’s birthday this year. The celebrations will be limited to cake-cutting in all the 403 assembly seats of UP. The usual pomp and show on that day will be scaled down.

 Every year, BSP celebrates Mayawati’s birthday on January 15 as ‘Arthik Sahyog Diwas’ (financial support day) with the slogan, ‘Ek vote, ek note’ (One vote, one currency note), a practice started by party founder Kanshi Ram. However, with the model code of conduct in force, the cadres have been advised against giving a call for donations. “Celebrations will be the party’s internal affair, but we cannot stop supporters from attending the function,” said a BSP zonal coordinator. A BSP member said the cadres have also been directed not to celebrate the day as ‘Jankalyankari Diwas’ by distributing sweets, fruits and quilt to the poor. “There is a strict direction from the party brass not to violate the model code of conduct,” he said.
 
 Sources, however, said the party might attempt a show of strength by organising functions in all constituencies. Many other events have been put on hold till January 15 to ensure that only Mayawati’s birthday celebrations are visible to the electorate. Demonetisation seems to be another factor behind the break in the tradition. “The party has opposed demonetisation strongly and it will drive home the message better by not accepting donation from supporters,’’ said an expert.
