Many reports recently made rounds that Varun Sandesh’s wife   had attempted suicide in a bid to end her life.

 It was stated that she had attempted suicide at her residence in Hyderabad by ingesting sleeping pills and social media went awry causing panic. There were even reports that suggested that she was rushed to a hospital in Banjara Hills. 
 
 But Vithika herself has now taken to Twitter to clarify these rumours. She tweeted – ‘Whatever the news is spreading around about us @iamvarunsandesh Everything is a just a rumor. We are doing great.’ She even went live on to news channels to clarify these rumours. 
 
 The rumours spread when the star wife returned from US recently and took some sleeping pills due to jet lag. But when she didn’t wake up from her sleep on Monday morning, her parents took her to the hospital and the doctors worked hard to wake her up. Vithika now claims that she’s fine and the reports on her   were nothing more than a hoax.
