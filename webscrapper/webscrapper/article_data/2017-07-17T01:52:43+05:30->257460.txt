 “Our target is to make the civic body deliver on  . We will soon launch a helpline for complaints about lack of sanitation. The same number can be used to report bribery,” said Shyam Sharma, former mayor and a member of the task force.
 
 The other members of the task force include former standing committee chairman Radhe Shyam Sharma and Kusum Khatri, an ex-councillor who had been on important positions in the past.
 
 “If somebody demands a bribe for doing a job, people can call on the helpline number and action will be taken against the official,” Sharma added.
 
 Sharma said he will identify officials who have not been transferred in the last three years. However, as the task force is a purely political formation, it can only raise a red flag over the issues.
 
 The task force will also inspect areas in south Delhi to help improve sanitation. They will seek public feedback to improve the situation with the help of councillors and officials.
