IMPHAL: Chief minister   has reiterated his demand that Prime Minister   spell out that the Naga framework agreement does not contain any points detrimental to the state's territorial integrity. 

 The Agreement was signed between the Centre and the   (Isak-Muivah) on August 3, 2015. The Centre, however, refused to divulge details of the agreement, giving rise to confusion and concern in Manipur and neighbouring Nagaland. 
 
 BJP leaders claim there is nothing concerning Manipur in the agreement. "If there is nothing pertaining to Manipur in the agreement, why are they hiding it from the public?" Ibobi asked.
 
 Ibobi was addressing election rallies at Konthoujam in Imphal West and Khurai in Imphal East. He is Congress's star campaigner, leading from the front against all opposition parties. The BJP campaign is likely to see the Prime Minister visiting the state to campaign for BJP candidates. 
 
 Ibobi said his government's decision to create seven new districts was welcomed by people and there were celebrations in different parts of the state. "Some parties, however, blamed the decision to create new districts for the blockade. This reveals that there is a nexus at work," he added.
 
 The chief minister, instead, blamed the NSCN-IM of being behind the indefinite economic blockade on the national highways of the state as the   (UNC), which is sponsoring the blockade, is backed by the outfit. He also claimed that the UNC is now backing the Naga People's Front (NPF), which, in turn, is part of the NDA.
