Patiala: The situation in Patiala eased on late Thursday evening when the seven farmer organizations that had called for a five-day protest outside the private residence of chief minister Amarinder Singh agreed to hold their agitation outside the city limits.

 However, the cops said there would be no let-up in the security arrangements that had been put in place to prevent any protest in Patiala.
 
 Farmer leaders held a meeting with Patiala DC Kumar Amit on late Thursday eveningand agreed that the protest would be held at Mehamudpur grain market on the Sangrur-Patiala road, at least 10km from the city limits. Following directions issued by the Punjab and Haryana high court this morning, the state government had earmarked a 7.5-acre land at Shermajra village, about 5-km from here, but the farmer organisations rejected the proposal and had approached the DC for another site.
