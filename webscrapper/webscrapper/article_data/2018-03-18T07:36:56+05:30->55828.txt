CHENNAI: Schools functioning without the mandatory   must put up a board in front of the institution informing the status of the recognition, the Madras high court has said.

 The first bench of   and   directed the   authorities to ensure that such boards are put up in schools without recognition.
 
 The court passed the order on a PIL moved by G Sundarapandiyan seeking a direction to the authorities to close down SVS International School, Thiruthuraipoondi, since it does not possess a valid recognition.
 
 Refusing to grant the relief sought, the bench said, “It is for the authorities to take a call on whether recognition shall or shall not be granted and to decide whether NOC shall be given or not. The writ petition for closure of school, in our view, cannot be of public interest. We direct the authorities concerned to ensure that a board is displayed by the schools indicating that application for recognition is pending if it was applied for or as it is not a recognised institution.”
 
 According to the petitioner, the school was started recently offering classes from pre KG to Class VIII without recognition or approval from either the state education department or from the CBSE and without the mandatory NOC from the state.
