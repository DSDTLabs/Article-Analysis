AHMEDABAD: A three-member team from Gujarat’s   (DFS) was sent to Kerala earlier this week at the request of Kerala police to investigate the controversial encounter in which two alleged Maoist leaders died. The encounter had taken place in November last year in the Padukka forest range at  .

 Kerala police had claimed that they had received information on the possible hideout of  , alleged to be senior leader of  , along with Ajitha. They came across a band of people who attacked the cops. Police retaliated by opening fire in which two of the attackers were killed.
 
 Maoist factions have claimed that the encounter was ‘staged’ as the two men killed were ill and not in position to ‘retaliate.’ After widespread protests, the government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. 
 
 Sources at the DFS said the agency was roped in recently primarily to find out the range and angle of gunshots. 
 
 “A team, consisting of senior ballistics experts, went to Kerala on January 3 and visited the spot, examined the photographs and other evidence about the bullet injuries. The team also went through case papers to study the circumstances. A reconstruction of the incident took place at the spot,” said a source.
 
 The source further said that the nature of the bullet wounds would play a crucial role in corroborating or refuting police claims about the encounter. Injuries reveal the range of fire, the angle of fire and the firearms used, the source said. 
 
 A report to the authorities will be submitted soon after return of the team, said sources.
