PUNE: A 57-year-old woman from   lost Rs 1 lakh to a debit   fraud which came to light when she received five transaction alerts of Rs 20,000 each on July 9. 

 She lodged a complaint with the   police against the fraudsters under the IPC and Information Technology Act on July 10. 
 
 Inspector V T   from the Airport police station on Thursday said, “The woman was at home when she received the text messages of the transactions between 9.20pm and 9.45pm. She called the bank’s call centre and blocked her card. She approached the bank with a complaint that her money was transferred illegally. She was advised to register an FIR.” 
 
 Sonde added that it is a card cloning case because the complainant did not receive telephone calls seeking information like PIN, CVV numbers and one-time password and nor did she hand over the card to any person or share the PIN.
 
 “We have sought details like whether the money was withdrawn from an   or transferred from her account to another online, and whether any images were captured on CCTV,” he said.
