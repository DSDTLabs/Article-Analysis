Chandigarh: A spot located on the edge of the road situated behind the Dev Samaj College, Sector 45, on the periphery of Burail village, has become an eye-sore for the entire neighbourhood due to the constant presence of garbage.

 Discarded objects made of plastic and scrap litter the place and stray dogs, who come searching for food, end up feeding on such harmful materials. 
 
 The turn of the road, which is sandwiched between the college boundary wall on one side and an array of shops on the other as opposed to being right next to the dividing road between Sector 45 and 46, has been a cause of grave concern for the local shopkeepers, visitors and the college students alike.
 
 “The smell here is gut-wrenching. It can easily cause someone to vomit. It is that bad. My shop is located just next to the dump and at times, it becomes difficult to even breathe,” said Shaymalal, a shopkeeper.
 
 The presence of two dumpsters at the location, with overflowing both solid and at times, wet waste as well, has become an issue for the people who reside in the same sector. The garbage is infested with flies which feed on rotten, decaying residue of food waste including vegetables, peels of fruits and vegetables. Other insects have also increased the risk of diseases here as well.
 
 Apart from the garbage, a large number of stray dogs also gather at the place, which have further exacerbated the trouble.
 
 The spot has also become a haven for scrap and other kinds of discarded products from the neighbourhood and other places, which have contributed to the otherwise grim spectacle.
