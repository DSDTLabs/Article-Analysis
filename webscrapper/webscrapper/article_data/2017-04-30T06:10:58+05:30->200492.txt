BAREILLY: As part of their special drive, the power department has lodged FIRs against 68 city residents in connection with power theft.
 
  The department inspected as many as 220 localities, including   city and Bareilly rural areas, during their four-day drive which was aimed at checking rampant power theft.
  
  The offenders have been booked under sections 135 (theft of electricity) and 138B (interference with meters or works of licensee) of the Electricity Act 2003 at various police stations.
  
  Among 68 offenders, 30 were caught without a legit power connection, while 38 others were booked for committing power theft despite having power connection.
  
  According to officials, 12 teams were formed to check power theft across the district, which conducted raids between 10 pm and 6 am starting April 26.
  
  Power department chief zonal engineer   told TOI, “During raids, we found a majority of consumers committing power theft despite having legit power connection. Usually, power theft increases during summers, which not only results in loss of revenue but also leads to overloading on the distribution network causing random outages.”
  
  “Power theft also leads to severe overloading on transformers/feeders, which results in tripping. Besides, overloading could be dangerous as it may completely damage the distribution equipment,” he added.
  
  Raids were conducted in  , Harunagla, Rajendra Nagar, Shahdana, Quila, Qutubkhana, Civil Lines, Nawabganj, Faridpur, Meerganj, Aonla, Izzatnagar and   among other localities.
  
    further said, “In case, a defaulter doesn’t have a legit power connection, the department gives 24 hours to him to get legit power connection, and if he fails, an FIR is lodged against him under sections 135 and 138B of the Electricity Act 2003.”
  
  Agarwal added that the department would conduct such raids in several other areas to crackdown on power theft.
