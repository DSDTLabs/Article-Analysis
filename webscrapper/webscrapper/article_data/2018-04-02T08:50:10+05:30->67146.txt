KOZHIKODE: Wayanad district education authorities have submitted a report to the   (DPI) stating that there has been no intentional denial of chance to three   to write the   at   in Wayanad.

 Education minister C Raveendranath had on Saturday sought report on the incident after three tribal students in Wayanad raised the allegation that school authorities denied them a chance to appear for the just-concluded SSLC examination with the intention to improve the pass percentage of the school.
 
 Wayanad’s deputy director of education Baburajan M said that the inquiry by DEO (district educational officer) has not found anything unusual in the incident and school authorities had taken steps to cancel the candidature of the students as they have been continuously absent for 15 days and all attempts to bring them back to school had failed. “As per the statements received from school authorities, the tribal mentor teacher and the ST promoter had visited the tribal colony to bring back the students to school,” he added.
 
 DEO K Radhakrishnan, who conducted the inquiry, said that prima facie it seems that the school headmaster had only followed the rules under the provisions of KSR – school authorities can remove students from the rolls if they are absent continuously for 15 days.
 
 “The request for cancellation of candidature has to be approved by Pareeksha Bhavan and school authorities had sent request from the parents of the students to Pareeksha Bhavan stating that the students do not want to appear for SSLC exams this year as they were absent from school for long periods,” he said, adding that of the 49 students who appeared for SSLC exam from the school this year, 17 were from tribal communities.
 
 Meanwhile MLAs A K Saseendran and OR Kelu, who visited Paravayal tribal colony at Ammani, have sought steps to enable the tribal students to write the SSLC examination under save-a-year (SAY) scheme. Kelu said that the students would be given special coaching classes at the colony by Adivasi Kshema Samiti (AKS).
 
 District Collector S Suhas has also asked the DDE to submit a report on the incident by April 3.
