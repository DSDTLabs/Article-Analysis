GURUGRAM: Residents of sectors 81, 82 and 83 off   have complained about lack of connectivity and police patrolling in the area. There is only one broken-down road from   to Gurugram, which is poorly lit at night, residents said.

 Residents said though internal roads have been built by developers, the service road near Kherki Daula toll plaza, which is the only road connecting them to  , is damaged and does not have proper lighting. This causes traffic jams and long queues at the toll plaza during rush hour. 
 
 “The service lane to Kherki Daula toll plaza is in bad shape. When it rains, we have to take a detour through villages. And during winters, the dust from the broken road adds to pollution levels,” said Praveen Tiwari, a resident of Sector 83.
 
 The service lane comes under NHAI. Officials said they are aware of the situation. “We’ve asked the concessionaire to maintain the stretch. Repair of the stretch between Rajiv Chowk and the toll plaza should be done soon,” said an NHAI official.
 
 Residents also said the stretch does not have adequate lighting, and is unsafe due to lack of police patrol. “There’s just one police station in Kherki Daula for all three sectors. Over 5,000 families live here, and there’s no night patrolling, making it unsafe to drive home, especially for women,” said Suneet Gupta, who lives in Vatika Gurgaon 21 society.
 
  “There is a liquor vend near the highway. Youths from neighbouring villages come to get drunk there and create a nuisance,” added Chitra Guha, another resident.
 
 Residents said despite requests for patrolling, cops can’t be seen on ground. 
 
 DCP (south) Ashok Bakshi said a PCR van patrols the area. “We’ve also been allotted some land for a police station. Once it’s ready, better   measures will be in place.”
