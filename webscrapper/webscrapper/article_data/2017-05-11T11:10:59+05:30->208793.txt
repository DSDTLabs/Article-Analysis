Allahabad: Uttar Pradesh minister of state for jail and public administration   said the   would soon introduce a policy to nab   and convicted criminals who use   to operate their gangs outside the jail. 

 The state minister was in Allahabad on Wednesday to attend a private function. "The state government's agencies are aware of the way in which criminals get access to cellular phones or internet calls by using the 4G technology. 
 
 They can easily rig the jammers installed in prisons due to separate frequencies and we are now working on it," said Singh. 
 
 Commenting on the overcrowded jails in the state, he said, "Plans are afoot to construct new jails in the state and to increase the number of barracks in the existing district jails."
 
 He said, "The state government is also considering the possibility of releasing those inmates, who have completed a term of 14 years in jail and are over 70 years of age. Previous government had done nothing in this context else the jails would not have been crowded in UP."
 
 The minister said the Supreme Court had removed restrictions on release of such prisoners in the year 2015. "Several states had released inmates who had spent 14 years in prison on January 26, 2016 after the Supreme Court order but the former Samajwadi Party government failed to do so," he added.
