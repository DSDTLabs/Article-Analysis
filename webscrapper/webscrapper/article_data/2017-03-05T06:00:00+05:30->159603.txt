Arbaaz Khan’s performance as a menacing don has become the talking point of  . Although Arbaaz was seen for just about 15 minutes in the second half, his presence was worth its weight in gold, reckons actor  . “It’s a very powerful role and we needed someone with a striking screen presence. Producer   proposed Arbaaz’s name. He fit the bill perfectly, but his last Telugu film was   in 2005, so we weren’t sure if he would be game. We approached him anyway and sent the synopsis of the script. Thankfully he loved it and agreed to come on board,” recalls the actor, who confesses to being intimated by Arbaaz initially. 
Apparently everyone on the set used to address Arbaaz as ‘Tiger Bhai.’ “He looks so serious and exudes a certain intensity. But when we sat with him for a chat on the second day, we discovered his fun side. He has a great sense of humour and has everybody around him in splits. He has a sarcastic take on everything. If you sit with him for half-an-hour, your sides will be aching for 25 minutes because of incessant laughing. It was awesome working with him,” says Tarun.
