VISAKHAPATNAM: The ongoing   works at the   (Vuda) Health Arena is causing inconvenience to visitors, particularly walkers.

 The underground cabling works started in September 2016 and were supposed to be completed by December 15, 2016, as agreed by Vuda and AP Transco. However, as of Monday, the works were still pending.
 
 A senior Vuda official told TOI that it was not part of their work and the project developers are now saying it would be completed by February 28.
 
 “Many visitors including morning walkers are facing difficulties due to the uncleared waste inside the arena,” Vuda officer said.
 
 K Nehru Patnaik, 76-year-old Indian Railway retired employee from HB Colony, who walks at the Vuda Health Arena everyday said, “The Vuda authorities opened an alternative route for walkers, but it is too narrow. The number of walkers may increase soon as summer is closing in. We request the authorities to complete the pending works at the earliest,” Patnaik said.
 
 An official from Transco said, “The work was kept pending at the clubbing of three joints at the entrance of the arena near ropeway. We will complete it soon.”
 
 Vuda built the arena at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore. In January 2016, a giant Lord Buddha statue was inaugurated inside the arena. The arena consists of a cycling and walking track of 4 kilometres on both sides. Nearly 1,500 walkers daily visit the arena in the morning and 500 in the evening. The number increases during he holidays.
