MYSURU: Following the belated monsoon showers that lashed   last year, this part of the state continues to receive excessive rain in the pre-monsoon season. Data compiled by the   (IMD) shows that South Interior Karnataka, which includes Mysuru, Mandya,   and Kodagu, received more than twice the amount of normal   between March 1 and April 11 this year. The average rainfall in this region of the state recorded in this period is 38.8mm, against a normal quota of 18.3mm. Kodagu, which witnessed a comparatively dry 2017, has received 76.5mm rainfall, the highest in the region. 

 Mysuru district, meanwhile, has received 62.4mm rain in the aforementioned period, against a normal quota of 22mm. Meanwhile, Shivamogga has received 21.6mm rain, Mandya 30.7mm and Chamarajanagar 37.5mm. The   have emboldened experts to encourage   to start preparing the land for sowing. Farmers have also been advised to start procuring seeds for pre-monsoon   activities.
 
 Director of Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) Srinivas Reddy attributed multiple reasons for the excessive rainfall during this period. “There are many weather formations occurring in this period, including formation of clouds locally in the summer. This has resulted in excess rain,” Reddy told TOI.
 
 He added that the excess rain was likely to have multiple effects. “Excess rainfall is likely to have many positive effects. Pre-monsoon showers are likely to help growth of grass, which will cover the soil and turn into food for livestock. Adding to this, rainfall will bring down pressure on groundwater. It will also help bring down the temperature level, which is very critical in the summer,” Reddy said.
 
 On the possible damage that standing crops might have sustained owing to these unseasonal showers, he said, “Only farm products at the harvesting stage would have been damaged.”
