PATNA:   purchased 45 highly trained   from Remount and   (RVC)   in Meerut after spending Rs 63.53 lakh last year, but could not provide proper medical facility and shelter to them, leading to illness and even death.

 Two of the dogs of Labrador breed, one from Gaya and the other from Muzaffarpur, died due to illness in Patna in the last ten days. Surprisingly, one of them, even after illness, was used for security purposes during Prakashotsava, the sources said.
 
 Out of the 45 dogs, 25 were of sniffers, 15 trackers and five were trained in underground mine detection. Each of these dogs came with a price tag of around Rs1.4 lakh. 
 
 “These dogs lack proper medical facilities and shelter. Regular health check-up is also not conducted due to which they die,” said an IPS officer on the condition of anonymity, adding that those who handle these dogs give them injections and administer saline on their own on several occasions.
 
 He also said the state police planned to have 200 trained canines with at least four at each district headquarters.
 
 The sources said one canine shelter has been constructed on the Shastri Nagar police station premises where eight dogs could be accommodated. But it is yet to be handed over to the police for shifting the canines.
 
 Gaya SSP Garima Mallik said the dogs are kept inside proper shelter at the police lines. “I will look into the first line of medical help provided to them,” she said. However, Muzaffarpur SSP Vivek Kumar could not be contacted for his comment.
