CHENNAI: Residents of   and surrounding areas in Perungalathur are spending sleepless nights after spotting a marsh crocodile (crocodylus palustris) in a waterbody 20 days ago.

 There are at least three reptiles in the lake and one of them can be seen basking on a rock there daily, between 7am and 8.30am, residents told wildlife activist   who has been visiting the spot over the last three days.
 
 The biggest is around 4ft long, while the two others are relatively small. As the heat rises, they crawl back into the water body that is only slightly bigger than a temple tank.
 
 The most commonly seen reptile is about 3ft long and could be a female, said Ravi. The lake is located close to the main road on which traffic movement begins around 8.30 am.
 
 Officials at the   in Vandalur, just 2km from the lake, said they also received a complaint about the presence of a crocodile in the water body but said there was no question of any reptile having escaped from the zoo. “Breeding of crocs at the zoo stopped some time ago,” said an official.
 
 Usually, another official said,   coming out of eggs are alomst immediately snatched by predatory birds. “But, these could have managed to escape and end up in the lake,” he said.
 
 Wildlife headquarters range officer Murugesan said he led a team to the lake. “The water level is high and it would be difficult to trap the reptile. If the panchayat arranges to pump the water out, we can trap it,” he said.
 
 Marsh crocodiles, or muggers, are found all over the country. Ambush hunters, they lie patiently for a long time before launching the final, often lethal, strike.
