NEW DELHI: Signalling a deepening divide between   and the ministry of information and broadcasting, the board running the public broadcaster has rejected the National Film Development Corporation’s demand that   settle a bill of Rs 2.92 crore accrued in hiring a private firm to do live coverage of the International Film Festival of India held in Goa last year. 

 Sources told TOI that Doordarshan had, in a run up to IFFI 2017, put in writing its objections on allowing a third party to cover the annual film festival. 
 
 Doordarshan said it was “fully qualified” to do the job on its own. In the February 15, Prasar   board meeting, however, the ministry’s nominated representative, Ali Rizvi, mooted the proposal once again, and submitted a letter from   director asking DD to pay the private company for its services. 
 
 The matter, which was listed as a “tabled item” for the board’s consideration, was rejected, once again citing DD’s objection to a third party being hired to do a job the public broadcaster said it was equipped to do. Sources said DD director general   and member finance  , had both registered their objections in writing. 
 
 Until 2016, IFFI, the flagship film festival of the information and broadcasting ministry was handled by the directorate of film festivals. From 2017, however, the management of the film festival was handed over to NFDC. 
 
 The film development corporation had then hired a private company to do live coverage of the IFFI, even though Doordarshan had, until now, singlehandedly been responsible for live coverage of all government events; the Republic Day parade, Beating Retreat as well as IFFI, in previous years. I&B secretary N K Sinha could not be contacted for comment.
