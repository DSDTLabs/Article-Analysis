HYDERABAD: Making it clear that when public money is looted by financial frauds courts will not be bogged down by technicalities raised by the accused, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy of the Hyderabad High Court on Wednesday dismissed the petitions filed by the top brass of Hyderabad-based   Infrastructure Projects & Hotels Ltd challenging the second   lodged against them by the CBI. Leo Meridian CMD G S Chakravarthi Raju, along with his relatives and friends, took a Rs 430-crore loan from a consortium of banks for 900-room hotel at  .

 CBI registered first FIR in 2015 on one bank's complaint and second one in 2017 after another bank's complaint.Though the accused's counsel argued about the futility of the second FIR, stating a supplementary chargesheet would have sufficed, judge disagreed.
 
 “This is not a case where you can invoke the jurisdiction of the court under   482,“ the judge said, while agreeing with the arguments of CBI's counsel, K Surender, who said the hotel management may have taken the loans from a consortium but each bank had lent separately based on their own procedures. While the first chargesheet was filed against Leo Meridian's CMD and some employees, the second intends to look into the role of the CMD and some other directors in the fraud, the CBI counsel said.
 
 Agreeing on the need for probe to proceed in the second FIR, the judge said: “Otherwise it becomes difficult to unearth such serious financial frauds against public institutions. The money banks lend to industrialists belongs to poor depositors and if those indulging in corporate fraud are allowed to go scot-free, public depositors are ultimate losers.“
 
 “In view of the seriousness and gravity of the offence, I find no grounds to quash the proceedings at this stage. The directors of the hotel project allegedly committed a serious economic offence by submitting false statements and made the consortium members believe they complied with all requirements and documentation. They took away the entire amount without completing the hotel construction,“ the judge said.
