AMRITSAR: Notwithstanding their differences with the party high command over sidelining  , the 15 councillors took oath at the office of divisional commissioner,   on Thursday.

 “All of us had gone to Jalandhar today to take oath in the office of divisional commissioner,” said   Singh, one of the Sidhu supporters, elected from ward number 26.
 
 Fifteen councillors had boycotted the Amritsar municipal corporation’s general house meeting which was held to elect the mayor on January 23 in protest against the party high command not inviting Sidhu to attend the function and taking his consent on the mayoral candidate.
 
 Justifying their earlier stand, Damandeep said their decision was right since they felt resentment over their ‘boss’ being ignored. “Now, our boss has attended the cabinet meeting so we also went to Jalandhar to take oath. Besides, Sidhu had asked us to take oath and work for the welfare of people and development of our respective wards,” he said.
 
 However, the problem is not over for dissenting Amritsar councillors as the district   committee has issued them show-cause notices over skipping the MC general house meeting, asking them to reply within five days.
 
 Amritsar district Congress committee president   said all party councillors were soldiers of the party and were supposed to attend the MC’s general house meeting to elect mayor but they chose differently and held a separate meeting in a hotel. He said he had contacted them and had asked to attend the function, yet they ignored.
 
 Recommending a disciplinary action against them, Kishore said he had issued show-cause notice to all of them, asking them to reply within five days after receiving the same.
 
 “Yes, we have come to know about the notices issued by the district Congress chief but we are yet to receive them. Once we receive, we will reply accordingly,” said Damandeep.
