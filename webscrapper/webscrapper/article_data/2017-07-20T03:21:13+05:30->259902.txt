NEW DELHI: In an unusual sign of unanimity, both   and BJD want to celebrate the glory of the first armed farmer-warriors’ uprising in   against the East India Company in 1817 known as   Rebellion. But both are engaged in a game of one-upmanship in this mega celebration of the historic mutiny as the political stage in the state is warming up for the 2019 assembly elections.

 While the Centre had announced special celebration of the bicentenary of the rebellion when finance minister   presented the last Union Budget, Odisha chief minister   on Wednesday sent a proposal to the Centre to declare the mutiny of 1817 in Khordha district as the “First War of Indian Independence”. The proposal came just a day before the culture ministry is to hold an event in the national capital to celebrate the event.
 
 The Odhisha cabinet on Tuesday passed a resolution to urge the Centre to accord this recognition to the historic event. The scramble by both parties for credit comes at a time when BJP has put Odisha in its list of “must-win” states.
 
 In April, PM Narendra Modi had felicitated descendants of the Paika warriors at Bhubaneswar.
