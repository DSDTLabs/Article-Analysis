Hyderabad: Singapore-based low-cost carrier   on Friday announced that the merger of Tigerair into it has been completed and both the airlines will henceforth operate under the Scoot brand.

 “All previous Tigerair flights will be operated under the Scoot brand…. This marks the completion of the Scoot-Tigerair integration process that began last May when the airlines were brought under a common holding company, Budget Aviation Holdings,” Scoot country head Bharath Mahadevan said.
 
 Mahadevan pointed out that the integration has brought about efficiency in terms of utilising the fleets of both the airlines. The airline now operates 14 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 23 Airbus A320s and has ordered six Dreamliners and 39 A320s. Post-merger, Scoot now operates 50 flights a week out of eight destinations. Earlier, Scoot used to operate 11 flights and Tigerair used to operate 39. In the next three to four years, the airline is planning to launch services from places such as Bhubaneswar, Guwahati and Goa, among others.
 
 The company’s top official pointed out that the airline is profitable in India but there are constraints in terms of expansion in the market. “We are very bullish about tier-2 cities in India but are constrained by the bilateral (agreements) between the Indian and Singapore governments that does not allow us to increase our capacity because of the seat cap on every city… There is a huge pent-up demand in India,” he added.
