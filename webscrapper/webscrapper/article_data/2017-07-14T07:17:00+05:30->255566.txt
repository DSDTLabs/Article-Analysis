GREATER NOIDA: The   on Thursday said that it had cancelled the allotment of a 4.5 acre group housing plot of   Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Greater Noida’s Sector Pi. 

 According to the Authority, the builder has not carried out any construction on the plot in the past 12 years. The allotment, for constructing residential units in Sector Pi, was made in September 2006. “They were allotted 4.5 acres and the project was to be completed by September 2012,” said Janardan, additional CEO,  . “Fortunately, no third party rights have been created as the builder has not submitted its building plans so far,” he said.
 
 “We sent the builder many notices warning of impending cancellation but the developer has not paid heed to our warnings. We issued a show cause notice on June 2, 2015 to the builder to respond within 15 days. However, when we did not receive any reply, the allotment was cancelled on June 25, 2015. Almost simultaneously, we received a reply from the builder citing health and other issues for the delay,” the ACEO said.
 
 Subsequently, the cancellation was withdrawn on July 16, 2015. The builder was granted an extension of four years for construction after paying extension charges. However, once again the builder failed to make any constructions in the stipulated time-frame. Following this digression, a show cause notice was issued to the builder on February 22, 2017 and a final notice on May 18, 2017. The allotment was then cancelled on July 6, 2017. 
 
 Officials of Assotech Infrastructure Pvt Ltd did not comment on the issue.
 
 According to the ACEO, GNIDA has also issued show cause notices to six other developers in Greater Noida. “After land is allotted to developers, registration done and building plans sanctioned, the construction has to be started in a year. In the case of these developers, no construction has been carried out. In these cases, we have an outstanding amount of more than Rs 200 crore across 27 acres of land,” he explained.
