CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister   will be “packed off to their residences” in a week as they cheated V K Sasikala, who was instrumental for their political growth, said ‘sacked’ AIADMK (Amma) general secretary   on Friday.

 Speaking to reporters outside his residence at Adyar here, Dhinakaran said, “Adharma and betrayal have never triumphed. In one week, we will end this rule of betrayal.”
 
 Dhinakaran thanked the DMK for allowing his faction to implead in a case seeking confidence vote. “They allowed us to implead ourselves in the case in the Madras high court, as the DMK was also started by former chief minister C N Annadurai. But at the same time, the DMK is our main opposition party, and there will be no alliance with that party,” he said.
 
 “The governor delayed (ordering a floor test), but the DMK won’t keep quiet. They want elections to happen and so they moved the court (for a floor test),” Dhinakaran said.
 
 “It is only after seeing the happening in the speaker’s office that we ran to senior advocate P S Raman. Since there was already the same type of case in the high court, we impleaded ourselves in it to stop the speaker from disqualifying our MLAs,” said Dhinakaran.
 
 Asked how long the MLAs supporting him would stay in a resort in Coorg, Dhinakaran said it was only to save themselves from threats that the MLAs were staying in the resort.
 
 Dhinakaran said, “When Chinamma (Sasikala) recommended Palaniswami’s name as chief minister (in February), there were many MLAs who did not agree to that. Even Palaniswami asked me not to announce his name without getting the signatures of all MLAs,” said Dhinakaran.
 
 Ministers P Thangamani, S P   and K C Veeramani, who are supporting Palaniswami now, had actually wanted to leave the Koovathur resort in February as they were not willing to support Palaniswami, Dhinakaran said. It was Sasikala and himself who convinced them to support Palaniswami, he said.
