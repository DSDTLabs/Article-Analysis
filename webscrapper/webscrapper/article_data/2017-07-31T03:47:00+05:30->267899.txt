Margao: Issues on drugs, traffic jams and garbage dominated a major part of the discussions at the   village panchayat gram sabha, held on Sunday. 

 The newly-elected sarpanch Xavier Almeida told TOI that “following the panchayat’s resolution to modify the children’s park, which was submitted to former Velim MLA Benjamin Silva, the height of the wall of the park was increased, but anti-social elements continued consuming drugs and alcohol there, late in the evenings”. 
 
 “Gram sabha members also raised their concerns about the traffic jams they encounter due to the haphazard parking of vehicles near the popular Assolna restaurants, as well as on the Assolna-Cavelossim bridge. Another issue discussed was the fish baskets lying scattered in the fish market causing a stench,” Almeida said.
 
 The menace of stray dogs and illegal dumping of garbage was also discussed during the meet.
