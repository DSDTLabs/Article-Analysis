NEW DELHI: The Environment Pollution Control Authority ( ), an SC-mandated body, asked for a month-by-month update on work progress of the   sub-station. 

 During the EPCA meeting on Friday, power department and   (NTPC) officials submitted that the Tughlaqabad 400/220 kv station will be operational by July 2018. They also said that the Badarpur thermal power station will be shut down as soon as the sub-station becomes operational. “We are requesting the ministry of power to strictly adhere to the July 2018 deadline,” said an EPCA member. 
 
 Officials had earlier submitted that the Badarpur plant cannot be shut down because it is needed to meet a part of the summer demand, but when the   sub station becomes operational that issue will be resolved. The land acquisition for the Tughlaqabad sub station is complete.
 
  Delhi power secretary Varsha Joshi said the lieutenant governor is likely to take a decision on how the land of the Badarpur plant will be used after it’s closed. EPCA members said NCR thermal plants should consider a gradual shift towards natural gas. Officials discussed in detail about how gas was expensive compared to thermal. 
 
 EPCA member   asked if cheaper options like solar power plants will make it easier to convert to natural gas. “We want Bawana   to run on full capacity on natural gas,” said EPCA chief Bhure Lal.
 
 EPCA members asked officials about their strategy to deal with the Badarpur flyash pond. Officials said they plan to plant Ipomoea. “We will level the land then conduct Ipomoea plantations. There are 250 lakh tons of fly ash. NHAI will take 1 lakh ton for road projects. We are also sprinkling water to avoid flying of the ash,” said an official.
