PANAJI: Starting on May 15, Goa   (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, will begin three levels of registration to smoothen functioning of the outdoor   (OPD).

 The online registration will also be introduced in the hospital shortly, said health minister  , following his meeting with heads of the departments (HoDs) of GMC on Friday morning.
 
 On an average GMC receives 1,700 OPD patients a day. About 60 surgeries, 30 major and minor each, are conducted in the hospital on an average every day.
 
 Rane said the new system which they intend to introduce by mid-May, will not require patients to come early morning to take appointments.
 
 “We don’t want patients to stand in line for appointments,” said Rane. Also 50 % of the total OPD registration will be done online. “I have proposed to set up a health information centre,” said Rane, adding that the file has been moved for the same.
 
 The premium hospital in the state has plenty to catch up with in terms of computerization. However, the health minister expressed his resolve that he would settle all problems of the hospital but needed at least six months to have the system in place.
 
 CCTV cameras will also be installed in the hospital. Instructions have gone to concerned authorities to install air-conditioners in OPD consulting rooms without any delay.
 
 Rane said he received valuable suggestions from the HoDs about improving OPD functioning, some of which will be implemented.
 
 To overcome the shortages of doctors in hospitals and primary health centres, Rane said it was important to make medical students stick to their bonds, which they sign at the time of admission.
 
 Rane said he was unanimous with the HoDs that bonds should be strictly implement. “No exemption will be given to any of the students,” said Rane.
