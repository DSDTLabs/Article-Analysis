GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat   will use a cellphone app — BJP booth TT — to manage the 48,000 booths duing the 2017 assembly elections. The party also plans to train in-charge workers for these booths in the use of Whatsapp and social media.

 The   will test the new app in the booth-level Vistrak drive that begins from May 28, 2017.
 
  The party will send information about the state and central governments to the trained in-charge of booths who will act as Whatsapp group administrators. Each will send the messages to at least 100 other persons. 
 
 “This will be a one-way communication. The party will not form Whatsgroups as, in the past, objectionable content was posted. This had caused embarrassment to the party,” a source in the BJP said. 
 
 State BJP spokesperson   said the mobile app was called ‘BJP booth TT’. 
 
 “The party will monitor all activity at the booths on a real-time basis. The app will be used in the Vistrak drive across the state,” Pandya said. 
 
 All incharge of booths and workers visiting different booths will download this app on their cellphones and update details. 
 
 “We will give a secret registration code to every worker. Workers will collect crucial information about the booths using the app,” Pandya said. 
 
 Information about functioning of the booth committees, contact information of booth committee members, details of members present for listening to PM’s ‘Man Ki Baat’ programme, number of missed calls made on cellphones are crucial, Pandya said. 
 
 Vice-president of Gujarat BJP, IK Jadeja, said that the chief minister, deputy CM, all ministers and all party office-bearers will take part in the Vistrak drive. 
 
  president Amit Shah will also take part in the drive in Chhota Udepur and visit the homes of booth workers, Pandya said.
