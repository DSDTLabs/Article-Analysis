Panaji: A few voters who arrived at polling stations to cast their ballot had some anxious moments either because they couldn’t find their names in the rolls or were listed in a different constituency.

 Philomena and Sudarshan Naik from Vidyanagar, Margao, were surprised to find that their voters’ IDs listed their constituency as Fatorda while other residents of their complex belong to the Margao constituency. When they went to a booth near Margao police station to cast their vote, they were sent to Ravindra Bhavan in Fatorda instead. But, here too, their names didn’t appear on the rolls. “We called the helpline but it was of no help either,” Philomena rued. tnn
