Actress   has denied speculation that she is dating   dancer  , and said she is very much single.

  
  
 "I don't think anything of it. I know what's going on in my life, so whatever everyone else wants to think, I just let them think it because I know," Atkinson told. Atkinson had earlier said she would love to settle down and get married one day, but wants to find the right person first.
 
 "I'd much rather be on my own and be happy than be in the wrong situation with the wrong person. I would love marriage and I would love kids, but not until I'm in a place where I'm ready for them. I don't want to just fit the mould because I'm running out of time. No chance," she had said.
