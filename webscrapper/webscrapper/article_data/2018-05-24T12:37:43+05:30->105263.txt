ROHTAK: Expressing strong displeasure over   government’s no to withdrawing cases against members of the Jat community languishing in jails related to the February 2016 violence, the All India Jat Aarakshan Sangrash Samiti (AIJASS) on Wednesday threatened to renew its stir from June 2.

 Addressing a press conference in Rohtak on Wednesday, AIJASS general secretary Ashok   alleged that the government had backtracked from its promises to withdraw all cases against the community members. He alleged that the government did not back them with the right intention in the courts, otherwise all cases would have been withdrawn in the last two years.
 
 Balhara said other state governments had withdrawn even serious cases against those involved in agitations and violent situations. “Similarly, the state BJP government in Haryana should not have a problem in cancelling the cases against Jat community members,” he maintained. Balhara said Jassia village in Rohtak district would continue to remain the epicentre of their agitation and their protest would be over only after all their demands were met. He said 320 community persons, who were in jails related to the violence, were out on bail except a handful of cases related to arson at finance minister Capt Abhimanyu’s properties in Rohtak.
 
 “A Jat delegation attempted to meet   to settle the remaining cases related to torching of his house in Rohtak but the leader did not show any positive response so far,” he said.
