DHARAMSHALA:   Anurag Thakur on Saturday stated that he would be starting a campaign to get the laborers and workers of   registered under Labour Welfare Department and other such organizations to avail Center sponsored schemes meant for them.

 He said that there are many schemes which have been started by the Center government but were not reaching to the beneficiaries due to lack of awareness.
 
 Thakur said this while participating in a program organized by the department at Hamirpur. "Mostly the workers working in unorganized business sector were deprived of such schemes. I would start a awareness campaign particularly to focus such population, there are many in state", he said.
 
 However, as per the rules the hotels, schools and other business units which have more than 10 employee need registration under EPFO ( ).
 
 Even the government contractors too need this registration in which employer and employee contribute minimum ratio of the salary and GOI gives interest on it. An employee can avail this savings within a gap of three months after he leaves the organization.
