VADODARA: It was one fine day, about five years ago, when   was playing cricket with some boys near her home in Kandivali in Mumbai that   spotted her. Naik immediately recognized Radha’s talent and approached her parents with an offer to coach her. And, her life changed forever. From playing tennis ball cricket with boys, Radha made a swift transition to professional cricket in Mumbai. 

 “What puts Radha apart from others is her courage and positive approach towards everything. She gives 100% on the field. I spotted her extraordinary fielding skills first apart from her bowling,” 59-year-old Naik told TOI. Radha got enrolled in Naik’s cricketing coaching academy in Mumbai and spending most of her time on the field. 
 
 “I was passionate about cricket since childhood and always played the sport with boys in our colony. My elder sister too used to play far better cricket than me but she didn’t pursue it later. I was, however, determined to do well,” Radha said. A twist came three years ago when Naik decided to shift to Vadodara with his family. Radha, who shares a special bond with Naik, said she too will shift base along with him. 
 
 “I had trained her since she was 12 years old so she was adamant that she wanted to be coached by me. Radha talked with her parents who agreed to let her move to Vadodara,” Naik said. And he is glad that she is playing from BCA. “The cricketing facilities here are very good so she gets to practice a lot. Also, she got good opportunities to play here unlike Mumbai where there is tough competition,” Naik added. 
 
 Radha, who studies in  , said that while shifting to BCA she never thought about her chances of playing for India. “I just wanted to play cricket,” she said. Her father is a shopkeeper while mother is a housewife.
