Dharamshala: The BJP-ruled government in Himachal Praesh has dissolved the board of directors of Kangra Central Cooperative Bank (KCCR), according to the previous chairperson of the bank.

This is dictatorship. I received a letter in which they have levelled baseless allegations,” he said.
 
 The non-performing assets of the bank had touch Rs 720 crore, cooperative minister Rajiv Sehjal had said during the recent Vidhan Sabha session. However, Sapehia has said most bad loans were passed during the previous term of the BJP in the state when P K Dhumal was the chief minister. “I have not issued a single such loan in my tenure,” he said.
 
 Sapehia’s term was to end in September. Sehjal had said during the budget session in the state assembly that a probe had been marked into irregularities at the bank, including foreign tours undertaken by its representatives.There were 18 members in the bank’s board of directors. 
 
 After the issue of irregularities in the bank was raised, the registrar of cooperative societies at Shimla ordered the dissolution of the board. Following this, deputy commissioner Sandeep Kumar was appointed as the administrator of the bank.
