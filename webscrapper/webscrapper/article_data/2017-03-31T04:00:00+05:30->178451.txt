Ahmedabad: The negotiation between   Limited and its   workers over a wage hike and other issues remained inconclusive as both the parties could not reach the consensus on wage settlement during a meeting held at deputy labour commissioner’s office in Ahmedabad on Thursday.

 “The stalemate between the company and its workers at Sanand plant continued with workmen demanding wage settlement for three years, while the company offered wage settlement for a period of four years,” said M S Patel, deputy labour commissioner, government of Gujarat. It was for the third time that a meeting between the workers and company management was held at the labour commissioner’s office.
 
 On March 2, a section of workers at the Sanand plant had sought state labour authorities’ intervention to resolve their issues, which included wage revision, higher bonus and modification in standing order pertaining to the plant.
 
 “Workers have not been given increment for the last two years. We are ready for three-year wage settlement,” said Hitesh Rabari, president, Bharatiya Kamdaar Ekta Manch, a workers’ union at the plant. “The company has concluded wage settlement agreement with Pune workers. Why the company is not looking at Sanand workers’ plight?,” he said. 
 
 Wage settlement is an agreement over wages following negotiations between workers and employers.
 
 “Tata Motors attended today’s conciliation meeting at the deputy labour commissioner office. The management and the union representatives are in continuous discussion on the matter in a positive spirit to reach a consensus,” the company spokesperson said in a statement.
 
 Earlier this month, some 200-odd workers at Tata’s Sanand manufacturing facility had boycotted company transport to return home to mark their protest against the management for not considering their demands.
