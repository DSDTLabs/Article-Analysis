CHENNAI: The Virudhunagar police believe that the   management placed assistant professor   under suspension in the hope that the issue would die down. Though they placed her under suspension on March 21, the college authorities neither lodged a formal police complaint nor inquired into the issue by constituting a college committee.

 The authorities woke up to the issue only on Sunday, at least   after taking departmental action against Nirmala Devi, only after members of a women forum and   members protested in front of the college demanding that the college authorities lodge a police complaint against the professor.
 
 After the police got wind of the protest, they approached the college authorities. It was only then that secretary of Devanga Arts and Science College R   lodged a formal complaint at the   police station and the police arrested Nirmala Devi.
 
 Virudhunagar district superintendent of police M Rajarajan sent a detailed report of the issue and the case was immediately taken up to the state government, which transferred it to the CB-CID on Tuesday. Ramasamy refused to comment on the issue as the matter is now under police investigation.
 
 The Aruppukottai police registered a case under IPC Sections 370 (trafficking of people), read with 511 (conspiracy) and Section 67 of Information Technology Act.
 
 Preliminary inquiries revealed that there were three factions in the college, one of which had leaked information about the issue to the womenâ€™s forum and ensured that they stage protests so it would become a bigger deal. 
 
 Investigations revealed that Nirmala Devi had obtained her PhD degree in Mathematics five years ago from Madurai Kamaraj University. (With inputs fromPadmini Sivarajah)
