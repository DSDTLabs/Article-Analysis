NEW DELHI: Underlining the need for speed in decision making, PM   has asked middle-level   to ensure routine matters such as preparation of minutes of a meeting should not take more than 48 hours. He has also asked officials to attend to Cabinet proposals and inter-ministerial issues on priority.

 “Speed of decision making is critical — officers should constantly endeavour to reduce delays in process,” said an official communication from cabinet secretary to all ministries quoting PM’s observations during his recent interactions with five groups joint and additional secretaries. Officials from different ministries and departments had also shared their views on governance.
 
 For long, there have been complaints of departments taking too much time even to issue minutes of meetings. Minutes of meetings pave the way for decision making within government.
 
 According to the official communication from cabinet secretary, all ministries and departments have been asked to develop inhouse capabilities to reduce dependence on consultants and external vendors. There have been several instances of several ministries engaging big consultancy firms to prepare reports on minor projects and issues.
 
 “In many cases, consultants simply take the data from ministries and rework on them to prepare smart-looking reports. Officials are becoming more and more dependent on consultants,” said a government official requesting anonymity.
 
 The communication from cabinet secretary mentioned PM observed that successful experiments in governance should be documented and developed into a framework for replication across the country.
 
 The PM has also asked the agriculture and animal husbandry ministry to explore the idea of “Sweet Revolution” which is being seen as promoting bee keeping in a big way. Modi has also asked the agriculture ministry to come up with the policy of encouraging farmers towards tree plantation on their land boundaries.
