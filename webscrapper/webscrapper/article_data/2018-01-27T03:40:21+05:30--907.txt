GURUGRAM: The 2018   will be conducted in the city from February 1 to 3 during which a team of officials under the   Bharat Mission will inspect the city on different aspects of sanitation. The   will include the sanitation levels at public and community toilets, open defecation, garbage disposal and implementation of various schemes under the Swachch Bharat Mission.

 “There is a huge role of the citizen feedback in this year’s survekshan and we request everyone to actively participate in the process and give their feedback,” said an MCG official.
 
 The 2017 survey covered 500 cities and Gurugram got the 112 rank. This year, the officials plan to survey 4,041 cities across the country.
 
 To improve its ranking in 2018, the civic authorities have taken multiple steps in the past one year. The corporation claims to have 125 functional toilets in the city and it is also expecting its integrated waste management plan to fetch some brownie points in this year’s survey.
 
 However, the city has a lot of issue that could mar its chances of a better ranking in the survey. For instance, despite the tall claims of an open defecation free district, many areas in the city still see a substantial number of people defecating in the open. Even after having a waste management plan, garbage heaps are spotted across the city.
 
 It must be noted that according to a central government release, there will be strict scrutiny of the claims made by the civic bodies and if any of the claims are found to be false, there is a 33% negative marking. In that case many of the claims made by authorities might do more harm than benefit.
