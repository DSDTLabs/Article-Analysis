Hugh   has opened up about wielding the famous   claws and the actor says he has got some   for good measure. 

 After working on nine X-Men movies, including the new installment ' ', the Australian actor says he has a lifetime of memories playing Wolverine, reported a leading news portal.
 
 "I can't tell you how many people I stabbed, how I stabbed myself. They were killing machines. 
 
 "I stabbed the double for Mystique right in the arm. Of course I freaked out a little bit. It's not every day you stab someone," Jackman says. 
 
 The 48-year-old actor adds that he "used to have to practice so I wouldn't hit people (with the claws). And one thing I neglected to practice was the follow-through...I've got a number of scars on my thighs, and it's really not cool. Got pretty close to some sensitive areas, but everything's fine."
