Actor   was recently at the   as guest for an intercollegiate festival. He happened to get a special gift, which he says he will treasure. He took to his   page to post, “Umesh, a physically-challenged staff member at #dayanandsagarcollege gifted me this beautiful piece of art. Heard great things about him from the students. A beautiful soul. Thank you for this kind gesture, all the best to you.”
