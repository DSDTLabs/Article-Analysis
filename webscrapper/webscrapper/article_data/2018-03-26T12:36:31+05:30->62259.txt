LUCKNOW : Finding anomalies in student enrolment in some government schools during UP Board exams inspection, District Inspector of Schools (DIOS) has directed schools in Maal and Malihabad, where less than 20% students appeared in the examination, to record   of students. “The enrolment in the schools in the two areas is 100% but the number of students who appeared for the examination was quite low.

 Also, students from farflung places had enrolled in these schools in Maal and Malihabad which raised suspicion on students’ authenticity and registration anomalies,” said DIOS Mukesh Kumar Singh.
 
 Final warning to schools : The secondary   has directed all government and aided schools to upload details of their principals and teachers on the website, upschoolstaff.in, by March 31.
 
 “Action will be taken against schools which fail to provide information by March 31,” said District Inspector of Schools, Mukesh Singh.
