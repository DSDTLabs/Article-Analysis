The actor said, "When I was staying in Gurgaon, before I left to study engineering in Mumbai, there were very few restaurants here. That time, the only option to go out in Gurgaon was 32 Milestone."

  Ravi added that now, when he visits Gurgaon, he has so many options that there is hardly any day when he doesn't dine out with his friends. "Whenever I come to Gurgaon, there are more restaurants in the city. When in the city, I go out every evening. I always want to try out new cuisines and new outlets here. Every place here has a different menu, which makes the dining experience special. This city has come up with so many things in the culinary space that now I have no reason to drive to Delhi to eat out." 
 
  The actor added, "Apart from Cyber Hub, Sector 29 can also be a new discovery for any foodie. I went to a place in Sector 29 that specialises in molecular gastronomy. I am so happy that there are such things here. While it's true that there is no place like Delhi when it comes to food like   and samosa, for new cuisines and global menus, I think Gurgaon is getting better."
