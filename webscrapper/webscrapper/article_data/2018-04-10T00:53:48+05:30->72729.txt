Erode: The state highways department has decided to stop vehicular movements on a 70-year-old bridge at Bhavanisagar near Sathyamangalam. The department will allow only two-wheelers to ply on the bridge as it has found the stability of the bridge in poor condition.  The public works department (PWD) had constructed the bridge across River Bhavani to transport construction materials when Bhavanisagar dam was constructed in 1948. After completing the construction of the dam in 1956, the PWD dedicated the bridge for public use.  “Residents of Pungar, Periyar Nagar, Karatchikorai, Pattaramangalam and Thengumarada used the bridge to reach their villages from Bhavanisagar,” a highways department official said. Talking to TOI, he said the bridge was under the maintenance of the PWD till date.  A decade ago, the PWD had warned heavy vehicle drivers not to use the bridge, citing its dilapidated condition. “However, the heavy vehicle drivers ignored the warning and used the bridge as usual,” the official added. A few days ago, the PWD handed over the bridge to the state highways department. Following this, SHD officials placed iron bars between the bridge walls to stop passage of heavy and small vehicles through the bridge.  Heavy and small vehicles have been asked to use Thottampalayam bridge to reach their destinations instead of using Bhavanisagar dam.  The state highways department has sent a detailed proposal to the state government to construct a new bridge across River Bhavani. “We will demolish the old bridge once we get nod and fund from the state government,” an official from the SHD said.
