PUNE:   leader   is eyeing the post of the leader of the opposition in the state legislative assembly with   quitting   and his MLA son, Nitesh, and close aide, MLA Kalidas Kolambkar, likely to follow suit.

 Congress has 42 MLAs and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 41 in the assembly. If Nitesh and Kolambkar put in their papers, the Congress’ tally in the lower House will be reduced to 40 and NCP can then claim the post of the leader of the opposition.
 
 “The policy of NCP and every issue in the party are decided by our leader Sharad Pawar. His is the last word in our party and we will follow whatever he said,” Pawar junior said in Baramati. Interestingly, he has taken an aggressive stand and is set to head various agitations against the Devendra Fadnavis government across the state.
 
 Acknowledging the possibility, leader of the opposition and Congress leader Radha Krishna Vikhe-Patil said he was ready to vacate the post. “Posts depend on the numbers a party has on the floor of the House. No post is permanent in politics and Congress will continue to raise people’s voice,” he said while reacting to Pawar’s aspirations. 
 
 Sources close to Ajit Pawar said NCP was keeping a close watch on the political developments. “Even if Nitesh resigns and Kolambkar refuses, NCP and Congress will have an equal tally. Under such circumstances, the Speaker will decide who will hold the post of the leader of the opposition,” an NCP leader said.
 
 Pawar junior has emerged as a unanimous state leader within NCP as the party’s veteran face, Chhagan Bhujbal, is in jail in the Maharashtra Sadan scam and a disproportionate assets case, R R Patil is no more and Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse Patil being sidelined. 
 
 Nitesh Rane had hinted that Narayan Rane holds the key of who will be the leader of the opposition in the state assembly. “The moment Rane decides, he can make state politics upside down,” Nitesh had said.
