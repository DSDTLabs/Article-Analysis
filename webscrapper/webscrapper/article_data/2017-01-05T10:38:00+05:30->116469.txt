 Speaking to TOI, Ramesh Kyatannavar, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dharwad, said that the assumption of decrease in the sale of liquor due to demonetization has proved to be wrong. “Demonetization has not affected the consumption of liquor and the sale registered a growth during the New Year celebrations. But the sale of beer has come down this time around. A slight increase in the price of beer and rising cold wave might have discouraged many to go for beer,” said Kyatannavar.
