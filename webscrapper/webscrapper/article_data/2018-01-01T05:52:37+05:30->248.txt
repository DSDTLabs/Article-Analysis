MUMBAI: Chief secretary Sumit   will be the new chief information commissioner (CIC). Mullick confirmed to TOI that he will soon take over as CIC. A proposal submitted by chief minister   to appointment Mullick as CIC was approved by governor   on Saturday.

 The CIC's post was lying vacant since June 1 after Ratnakar Gaikwad's term expired. According to reports, besides Mullick, at least half-a-dozen high-ranking bureaucrats were in the race for the CIC's post.
 
 With Mullick's new appointment, the question that surfaces is who will succeed him. If Fadnavis follows the seniority principle, Medha Gadgil, an IAS officer of 1983 batch, is the seniormost bureaucrat. She is followed by additional chief secretary (home)  , additional chief secretary (finance) DK Jain, MMRDA chief UPS Madan, additional chief secretary (industries) Sunil Porwal and  . All belong to the 1983 batch.
 
 A senior bureaucrat said, it is not a must to follow the seniority, principle since it is the CM's prerogative.
