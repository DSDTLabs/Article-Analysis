SYDNEY:   said on Wednesday that it was mulling a temporary shutdown of Facebook to uncover false accounts and block fake news in the Pacific nation, which hosts a major global summit later this year.

 
 The proposal, which communications minister   said could lead to replacing Facebook with a locally developed social networking platform, was ridiculed as ill-timed and unworkable by opponents.
 
 Basil floated the idea of a one-month shutdown on Tuesday, saying it would “allow information to be collected” on fake accounts and users who upload pornography and defamatory information so that they could be removed from the platform. “This will allow genuine people with real identities to use the social network responsibly,” he said. Basil also said   could create a local alternative to Facebook. “If there need be then we can gather our local applications developers to create a site that is more conducive for Papua New Guineans to communicate within the country and abroad as well,” he was quoted as saying by local media.
 
 No timeframe was given on the potential shutdown, although some reports suggested it could coincide with Port Moresby hosting the APEC ( ) summit later this year.
 
 A spokesperson for Facebook in Sydney said they had reached out to PNG authorities and were “working to address their concerns”.
