Ganesh Venkatram’s next film,  , is a topical one as it talks about social media obsession and how it affects our life. Says the actor, “Though social media is meant to connect people, it has also become a medium where authenticity of statements is questionable, and has led to a mindset that I would call intellectual illiteracy. The film’s directors   and   felt that so many stories could be told on this subject and that is how they came up with this script.” He adds that Shankar has a background in networking and hacking, which came in handy.

 The actor plays a cop who is assigned to work with cyber crime officers, played by Shwetha Menon and Erode Mahesh, on a case. Quiz the actor if he is concerned about being stereotyped in the role of a police officer, and he says, “This is because the character that I played in Unnaipol Oruvan was so impactful. But I don’t see this as a negative because it means that people look at me as an actor who will do justice to such roles.” His onus as an actor, he adds, is on ensuring that these roles are different from one another and stand apart.
 
 Ganesh is currently a part of 7 Naatkal, a drama-thriller that also has Sakthi Vasu, Nikesha Patel and Angana Roy, and is directed by Gautham, a former assistant of Sundar C.
