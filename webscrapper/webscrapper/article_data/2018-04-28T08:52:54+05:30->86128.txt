CHENNAI: Though it may be morally wrong to glorify the corrupt, the court cannot order removal of former chief minister of  's portrait from   assembly in the absence of any law prohibiting display of pictures of persons convicted for corruption, the Madras high court said on Friday. 

 The first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Abdul Quddhose made the observation while dismissing a PIL moved by DMK, seeking removal of Jayalalithaa's portrait from TN assembly.
 
 "Whether a portrait should be installed in the hall of the assembly, if so, whose photograph should be installed, are entirely matters for the speaker to decide. It is not for this court exercising the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution to sit on appeal over administrative decision of the speaker," the bench said.
 
 According to the petitioner, Jayalalithaa was found guilty of corruption charges. The Supreme Court found all the accused, including her, guilty in the disproportionate assets case.
 
 "In view of her demise, Jayalalithaa was not sentenced and appeals against her were treated abated. At the same time, the co-accused were convicted, sentenced to four years imprisonment with fine of 100 crore and the properties belonging to the accused were ordered to be attached," senior counsel for petitioner P Wilson said. 
 
 In such circumstances, the DMK had already moved the high court seeking to remove the photos and the name of Jayalalithaa displayed and mentioned in government offices, buildings, public sector undertakings and government schemes. While the case was still pending in the court, the speaker had allowed display of her portrait in the assembly, he added.
 
 Opposing the arguments, advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted that Jayalalithaa had not been convicted by the Supreme Court and that the portrait had been erected as per the powers vested on the speaker.
