Gurgaon: The enforcement wing of the department of town and country planning ( ) cleared Hong Kong Bazaar Mall, belonging to controversial former state minister Gopal Kanda, of all unauthorised kiosks and shops on Wednesday.

 However, neither did it seal nor demolish the mall’s second floor that has been constructed illegally, and instead gave the owner some more time to present his case.
 
 “We have removed all unauthorised kiosks and shops from the mall premises. The owner of the mall has been given some time to present his case for the illegal second floor,” said assistant town planner (ATP) Narendra Kumar.
 
 Hong Kong Bazaar Mall, inside Sushant Lok 2 in Sector 57, is spread over an acre. As per approved plan, the second floor could only have had 432.778 sq m of covered area. But the entire second floor was covered, in violation of the approved plan. DTCP had earlier issued notices to the mall for unauthorised construction.
 
 The DTCP team also carried out an anti-encroachment drive in Sushant Lok’s green belt. This was second time in this month that DTCP has carried out such a drive to free the green belt of all illegal structures. 
 
 The drive was carried out after a petition was filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), seeking demolition of illegal structures in green areas of Sushant Lok. “We had cleared a portion of the green belt on September 19 and the remaining areas were cleared on Wednesday,” said ATP Amit Madholia.
 
 The action against encroachments was necessary in order to apprise the NGT of the same at the next date of hearing on October 10.
