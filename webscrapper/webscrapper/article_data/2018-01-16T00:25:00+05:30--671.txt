Trichy: High demand coupled with restricted cultivation by farmers pushed up the price of sugarcane on Sunday, Pongal day, with each being sold at Rs 100 in Trichy. Anticipating low demand for the cane, farmers had restricted themselves to cultivating it in a limited area this time. However, the rise in the price was because of inclusion of sugarcane in the state government’s Pongal gift package, cane growers said.

 For the last few years, farmers had not been earning profit by selling Pongal sugarcane owing to high arrival and low demand in the market. However, this year the trend has reversed and helped the cane growers profit from last-minute sales. Trichy market relies on Thiruvalarsolai in Trichy and Thirukkattupalli in Thanjavur district for Pongal sugarcane.
 
 S Rajagopal, a trader vendor from Woraiyur vegetable market, said that following low sales last year, he had purchased only one a mini-truck of sugarcane from Thirukattupalli this time for Pongal.
 
 “Due to poor demand, last year, I was able to exhaust the stock around 11am on Pongal day while selling a cane for a maximum of Rs 50. But this year, all the canes were sold before 8am as each went for Rs 60 - Rs 70,” said Rajagopal. 
 
 As vendors in the city began to exhaust their stock before 8am on Sunday, many vendors from surrounding villages started to arrive in the city and sold a cane at Rs 100.
