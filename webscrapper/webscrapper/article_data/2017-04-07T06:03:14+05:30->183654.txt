HYDERABAD: Brother, sister, father, and the extended TRS family. It was all about this at the Armoor 'Janahitha Pragathi Sabha' on Thursday. Municipal administration minister KT   was the centre of attraction and his sister Nizamabad MP  , seemed more than happy seated beside him and appreciative of the adulation 'Ram anna' received from the crowd. 

 "I want to tell Kavitha what I have not told her before," 'Ram anna' said even as she listened to him attentively. "A Union minister told me that Kavitha is one of the five best orators in parliament," the minister said. The crowd responded with a thunderous applause.
 
 "And no, my father has not taught us anything about how to be good speakers. It was the Telangana movement and the people who inspired us to be what we are," KTR said. He said this in response to   MP D Srinivas who told the crowd how well chief minister   had mentored them.
 
 Kavitha spoke about the 'anna-chelleli bandham' (brother-sister bond) and said she was fortunate that she had a brother like Rama Rao and was sharing the dais with him at a public meeting for the first time. "I am glad he is your brother too," she said. 
 
 Speaking about his father KCR, Rama Rao said perhaps he was the one person who received the most abuses in the country because he had raised the demand for Telangana statehood.
