New Delhi: A 25-year-old man died after he fell unconscious in a tank containing waste water in a plastic factory in Bawana on Monday. The man, Pintu Das, was cleaning scrap material alone when the incident occurred.

 The accident happened at 7pm when Das went to the top of the tank and was sorting plastic from scrap. The tank was full of   gases and while cleaning, Das felt nauseated but continued to work.
 
 Suddenly he fell unconscious into the tank. Only after a few minutes, his co-workers realised that something was amiss and went up to look for him. They found Das inside the tank, pulled him out and rushed him to a hospital in   village, where he was pronounced brought   by doctors. 
 
 Police said prima facie evidence indicated that Das died of asphyxiation; however, a clear reason will only be available after the autopsy report.
 
 Though police officials have ruled out any foul play in the case, the co-workers and factory owners are being questioned regarding the hazardous working condition, which led to the death.
 
 The victim is a native of Assam and had been living in Bawana on rent for a couple of years and working in the factory. He is survived by his wife and three kids, all of whom live in Assam.
 
 A case under   sections 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery) and 304A (causing death by negligence) has been registered and investigation is on.
