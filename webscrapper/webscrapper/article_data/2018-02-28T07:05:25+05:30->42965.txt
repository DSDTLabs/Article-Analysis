NEW DELHI: Goods and services tax (GST) collections dipped marginally in January to Rs 86,318 crore as traders continue to avoid payments due to loopholes, even as finance minister Arun Jaitley said a transition to a single rate may not be possible till compliance improves. A single rate of   in India “can’t work at the moment” due to vast disparities in the society, he said at the India-Korea Summit, adding that the next stage of reforms will start once India becomes a significant tax-compliant society.

 “After we are able to improve the compliance levels, the other stage of reform will begin. For example, we have two standard rates and in the long run I do see them merging into one. For that to happen, it will take some reasonable time — that is, when the compliance levels start moving up,” the FM said.
 
 A few hours later, data showed that compliance remained patchy and collections in January remained a little lower than the previous month. Separate numbers released by the finance ministry also showed that filing levels varied across the country, with 88% of the traders in Punjab filing returns, while it was less than a quarter in Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
 
 
  
 
 
 Gujarat, UP, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and West Bengal too reported over 70% filing, but Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were among states which fared much lower, despite being among the more developed ones. Across the country, nearly 70% of the over one crore businesses filed GST returns, official data showed.
