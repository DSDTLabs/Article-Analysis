It was an incident in 2010 that made   decide that he wanted to become a director. It was also the same incident — that of a fight following the seizure of his vehicle in Bengaluru — that Vinay wanted to make into his debut film. Thus,  , which stars  ,   and  , was born.

 “I worked with a director in 2010 (I will reveal his name only after Seizer completes 100 days), after which I worked in some other films, and decided to turn director. The experience of my vehicle being seized was such that at that very moment I decided to take it to the big screen; I also decided that the name of the film will be Seizer on the spot,” says Vinay.
 
 The film, however, faced some delays. Vinay says that they took their time with making the film and the final output is proof of a job well done. “After shooting one schedule of the film, I realised that it needed bigger names. That is when producer   and I approached Ravichandran sir, Chiru,   and Parul Yadav. Securing all their dates was a challenge, so it led to some delay. The film’s post-production took over a year, because I believe that if a movie is edited well, and the sound and music are also worked on properly, then it will do well. Producers usually don’t like to give this much time, but ours concentrated only on the quality,” he says, adding that the result of this is that Seizer is a visual treat.
