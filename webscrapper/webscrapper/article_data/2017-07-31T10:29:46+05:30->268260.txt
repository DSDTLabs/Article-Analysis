TIRUNELVELI:   defeated   by 57 runs in their   clash here on Sunday. Chasing a stiff target of 183, Warriors got off to a good start with   (33, 1x4, 2x6) and   (34, 6x4) adding 62 for the first wicket in 8 overs. But once the partnership was broken, the wheels came off Warriors' chase. Veerans kept taking wickets and Warriors finished with 125 for 8.

 For Veerans, medium-pacer   (3-25),   (2-23) and   (2-29) were the standout bowlers.
 
 Batting first, Veerans saw their openers NS Chaturved (89, 8x4, 3x6) and S Siddharth (60, 6x4, 2x6) teed off from the word go as they added a 125-run stand which set the tone for the match. It was the highest opening stand for this season. The duo kept their opponents at bay for 14.2 overs before Siddharth was run out. 
 
 Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Veerans managed to score 57 runs in the last 5.4 overs. The first innings saw Veerans' Malolan Rangarajan get into an argument with Warriors' J Kaushik when his partner Sanjay Yadav (5) was run out. Malolan felt Kaushik came in the batsman's way which eventually broke the communication. The on-field umpires immediately swung into action before the situation got out of hand.
