 Wangchuk called for the need to devise an education system relevant to the context so that students exactly know what they are learning and why. Highlighting the need for bringing about a paradigm shift in education, Wangchuk said, “Awareness programmes and workshops are important to discuss environmental issues. However, education has a crucial role to play here and the present system of education lacks the necessary elements of environment education. While we teach industrial revolution, it should be explained in a holistic perspective including the adverse impact on the environment.”
 
 Wangchuk, who is the founding director of Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), has implemented a number of innovations including a project known as Ice Stupa, wherein he involved students in addressing the water scarcity issue in Ladakh. As part of this, they built a two-storeyed stupa which can store water and release it as necessary.
