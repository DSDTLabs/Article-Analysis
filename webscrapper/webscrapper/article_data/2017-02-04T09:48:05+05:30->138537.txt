When a visibly upset Divya, a 19-year-old from  , went to the   and took out a foetus from a carry bag, the police were shocked. Apparently, her   had fled, leaving her   and she wanted the cops to bring him back so that she could marry him. 
 
 According to the Ajjampura police, Divya claimed she had a miscarriage. “We were shocked and deeply pained when we saw the foetus in the bag. She said she had met Kantaraja, who is from the same village, about a year ago, and they had been in a relationship since he promised to marry her. She claimed she had not been aware of the pregnancy for a long time and eventually had had a miscarriage because of lack of medical care,” said an officer, adding that they took her complaint and started looking for Kantaraja.
 
 According to the locals, after Divya became pregnant, Kantaraja started avoiding the issue of marriage, and started making excuses claiming his parents weren’t agreeing or that he had to build a house first. They also alleged that he took her to a doctor and got the child aborted and later fled the scene.
 
 The police said they weren’t sure yet if Divya had a miscarriage or the foetus was aborted. But they did find the reluctant groom. “We were successful in tracing him. We counselled him and he agreed to marry her,” said an officer.
 
 The couple were married at a temple in Tarikere and even returned to the police station to thank the officers on Thursday. On Friday, they went to the sub-registrar’s office to register their marriage.
