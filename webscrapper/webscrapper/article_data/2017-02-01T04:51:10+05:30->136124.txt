NEW DELHI:   chief   said his party would win at least 90 seats in the first two phases of   polls. “We will win 90 seats,” he told reporters here about the party’s prospects in the first two phases scheduled for February 11 and 15. The 140 constituencies of western UP and neighbouring areas will go to polls in the first two phases of the seven-phase elections for 403 seats. 

 “We are wining the first two phases comfortably and it will set the stage for formation of a BJP government in the state,” Shah said after the BJP parliamentary party meeting. 
 
 Out of power since 2002 in the country’s largest state, the saffron party under Shah is making concerted efforts to wrest the state from  , which has ruled it alternately with BSP for the last 15 years. BJP aims to consolidate a clutch of backward castes and sections of Dalits to its core upper caste and Bania votes this time and hopes that this, coupled with its development agenda, will propel it to power. 
 
 It has decided to face the elections without a chief ministerial face, while SP and BSP have projected Akhilesh and Mayawati as their candidates for the top post.
