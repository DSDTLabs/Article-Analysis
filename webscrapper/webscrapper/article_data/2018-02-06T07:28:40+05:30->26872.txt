AHMEDABAD: After years of neglect, one of the   — the   (1954) — which is also Corbusier's first museum project of his lifetime will be restored.

 One of the world's leading institutes in conservation —   — is in Ahmedabad to hold a three-day workshop to draw up a conservation plan for Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-owned museum.
 
 The conservation plan is part of GCI's global initiative of helping in the restoration efforts of the only three of Corbusier's museums which also includes the Government Museum and   in Chandigarh and National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, Japan.
 
 The Foundation Le Corbusier, located in Paris, will also be assisting with the workshop. The three museums were designed in the 1950s and 60s based on Le Corbusier's concept of a ‘museum of unlimited growth’, which he considered to be the ideal museum plan allowing for future expansion. The three museums appear similar in size, form and floor plan, and also sit on his trademark pilotis. The GCI team will be in Chandigarh on Thursday to hold a similar workshop.
