NOIDA: The   federation has written to SSP Love Kumar and district magistrate BN Singh alleging that   is being played late in the night at community centres during the wedding season. They said numerous complaints had been filed by residents saying that elderly people and children were not being able to sleep while students could not prepare for the exams.

 “There is serious disturbance being faced by many citizens across the residential sectors due to uncontrolled and unhindered loud music in community centres during weddings and other programmes. Orders from chief minister   against use of loudspeakers as well as a   verdict of a 10pm deadline are being violated regularly,” said AN Dhawan, the secretary-general of the   (FONRWA).
 
 The RWA federation has sought necessary directives to the patrolling police teams to ensure that the volume of sound systems was kept low and restricted to the 10pm deadline as stipulated by the apex court.
