BENGALURU: As she said a little prayer and handed over the chit to the judge, Soundarya hoped it would be an easy word. As soon as she heard the judge say 'audience', she took a deep breath, and with a composed face, said: “A-UD-I-E-N-C-E“. That qualified her for the final round of the 8th   (SDIE)   on Saturday. While some managed to crack it in just one go, others were given extra chances. It was a day to hone   as over 160 students from government high schools across Bengaluru gathered for a war of words at RV Teachers College. Repeating the history of the past three years, students of government high school, Honaganahatti, made it to the victory stand. Vinitha from the school bagged the first place, Rakshitha came second while Divya Bai bagged the fourth place.   of Gangamma Government High School came third.

 With words like altitude, civilization, landscape, indifference and so on, the students battled for two hours, each one trying to outshine the other with the two-month training they were given by volunteers of Societe Generale, a global solutions centre, collaborating with SDIE.
 
 Ram Mohan Reddy , former judge, Karnataka High Court, said: “Every student in government schools has the tenacity to do well in every field.“
 
 “There is a huge gap between what is required and what is available in terms of providing good education to students. Organizations like SDIE are helping bridge that gap,“ M Lakshminarayana, principal secretary , public works department, said.
