MUMBAI: A mother of two with a crime record was arrested by the GRP on Tuesday for pushing a man onto the tracks in the path of an oncoming train at   station, resulting in his death on Saturday.

 
 Meenakshi  , 38, claimed that Deepak  , 56, had touched her on the staircase of the foot overbridge at the station and she had confronted him on the platform, sparking an argument. He had lost his balance and fallen on the tracks accidentally, she added.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Patwa’s relatives refuted the allegations, saying he never had any such complaints against him.
 
 Khakadiya, who lives at   in  , said she had gone to Mulund with her mother and cousin on some work on Saturday. Around 2.30pm, she was walking up the stairs of the FOB, and Patwa was climbing down. She claimed to the cops that his elbow hit her but he kept going down. She ran after him, confronted him on platform no. 3 and slapped him a couple of times. A male onlooker interfered and started pushing Patwa around. CCTVs on the platform captured Patwa being shoved by Khakadiya and the man onto the tracks and getting run over. The man is at large.
 
 “Co-passengers had witnessed the incident. A passenger said Patwa had tried to explain to Khakadiya that he did not touch her. He told her that she could have been mistaken. He also apologised in case his elbow had accidentally hit her. But Khakadiya and the male accused pushed him around, despite others shouting out a warning that a train was arriving,” said Patwa’s brotherin-law Ajit Shah.
 
 Shah was under the impression that Patwa had died in an accident until he saw the   footage. He pressed murder charges on Monday.
 
 The police then circulated copies of the footage, and an officer from Dongri police station identified Khakadiya. He had probed a case of cheating against her last year and had her address. He helped the GRP track her down (see box). Khakadiya’s cousin’s statement has been recorded.
