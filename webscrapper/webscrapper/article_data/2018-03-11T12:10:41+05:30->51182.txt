Actress   has donated $2,000 to a womans fertility fund after she criticised the actress on social media.

 Chastain shared a photo of herself on Instagram wearing a white t-shirt that read, "We Should All Be Feminists". It was captioned: "Feminism: The theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes."
 
 Twitter user Karin H.   responded that   only supports feminists who are anti-abortion. "Yes feminist that believe in God and stand up for The Unborn. I would be for that kind of feminist," Schulz wrote, reported people.com.
 
 Chastain has long been an avid supporter of women's rights and pay equality, and said she respected Schulz's opinion.
 
 She wrote to her: "Yes you can decide what is right for you. I am pro-choice and I believe that everyone has the right to make their own decision. I read about your journey to become a mother and it broke my heart. I hope that your dream will come true in 2018! Much love to you."
 
 Chastain added: "My eyes filled with tears as I read this, dear Karin. I have such belief in your dream. Don't give up sister. It's in your destiny."
 
 She was referring to Schulz's GoFundMe page which explained that she and her husband, Jeremy, had been trying to conceive a baby for years but had been unsuccessful.
