 According to UN estimates, over 379,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state into Bangladesh since August 25 when a fresh wave of violence erupted.
 
 According to media reports, the violence began when Rohingya militants attacked police posts in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state.
 
 Rohingya residents - a stateless mostly Muslim minority in a Buddhist-majority nation - allege that the military and Rakhine Buddhists responded with a brutal campaign against them, according to the reports.
 
 Bangladesh had earlier said the new influx of Rohingya   is an unbearable additional burden on the country which has been hosting around 400,000 Myanmar nationals who had to leave their country in the past due to communal violence and repeated military operations.
