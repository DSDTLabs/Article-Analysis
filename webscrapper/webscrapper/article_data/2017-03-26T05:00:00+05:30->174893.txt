The premier of  , a Deccani adaptation of legendary French playwright Moliere’s comedy,   at   on Friday evening saw a full-house. Staged by  , the play was a humorous take on a 60-year-old widower, Mirza Sakhawat Baig’s desperate attempts to marry an 18-year-old girl, Mariyam. Incidentally, his son Farooq is also in love with her. Though rich, Mirza leads a miserly life. Mirza also pressurises his daughter Azra to marry an old man against her wishes. Another central character in the plot is Nasir, who works as a servant and is Mariyam’s brother. The play ends with Farooq stealing all the money that his father had hoarded and Azra managing to escape the ordeal of being forced to marry a much older suitor.
The play, staged in typical Hyderabadi style, was a rib-tickler, replete with one-liners. And the team was greeted to a much-deserved standing ovation during the curtain call.
