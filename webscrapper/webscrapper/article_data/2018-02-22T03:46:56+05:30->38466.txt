MUMBAI: To curb malpractice, exam centres cracked down on cellphones of day one. At several junior colleges, students were not allowed to carry their phones inside, forcing them to leave them with strangers and vendors outside the centre. 

 "I waited outside Ruia College with mobiles of students," said   KM in a tweet to TOI. "A nearby sandwich vendor has mobiles of at least 30 students who were also caught unawares." 
 
 Ruia College principal,   said he was unaware of the incident and vice- principal, Jyoti Purandare, did not respond to calls.
 
 Similarly,  , an arts student did not get to carry her phone to her centre at Churchgate. "A friend's dad had his office close by, so we called him to take our phones. I don't know what to do for the next exam. I travel from   to Churchgate and my parents won't let me travel without my phone," said Rajpal.
 
 Board officials said the rule states that no cellphones will be allowed inside the exam centre. "We understand students travel distances, but cannot allow phones to be misused. So junior colleges may allow students to keep phones in bags or not allow them at all," said  , in-charge secretary of the state board's Mumbai division. The board's flying squad also confiscated 15 mobiles from 13 students and two invigilators at a centre in Mumbra.
