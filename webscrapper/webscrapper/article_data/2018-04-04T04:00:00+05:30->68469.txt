Bengaluru: In a first for a foreign hospitality player in India, the number of hotels   operates in the country, along with franchises, has touched 100. The milestone makes India the third country, after China and the US, where the over $17-billion Marriott has 100 or more properties. 

 “Five years ago, when we said we will have 100 hotels in India, nobody really believed it, but here we are,” said  , president and CEO, Marriott International. Marriott opened its 100th hotel — the   Benguluru — on Tuesday.
 
 While the three-digit number boosts Marriott’s hotel portfolio, it is yet to catch up with homegrown rival Indian Hotels, better known as the operator of the Taj chain, which has 129 properties in the country. However, the Maryland, US-based company has overtaken Taj in terms of number of rooms following its acquisition of global chain Starwood. Marriott, through its 15 brands, has 23,000 rooms in the country, while Indian Hotels has 17,000 rooms.
 
 Sorenson, the first non-Marriott family member to run the Nasdaq-listed chain, said that the company plans to open another 50 hotels in India in the next few years. The expansion could also see the introduction of its other well-known global brands — Moxy, Delta and Tribute — in the country, one of the fastest growing hospitality markets in the world.
 
 While Sorenson attributes India’s robust economic growth, rising domestic travel and e-visas to Marriott’s development here, he says factors like requirement of 60 permits to open a hotel and the 28%   on rooms with tariffs of Rs 7,500 above pose challenges. “There is no other market in Asia-Pacific that has such a high tax rate, making India an expensive market for travellers. The hospitality industry could do better if the GST is lowered.”
