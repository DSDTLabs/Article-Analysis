  : The activists of   (BJYM) burnt the blackened pictures of   (SP) leader   at   here on Friday alleging that he had hatched a conspiracy to defame local BJP MP Yogi Adityanath. 

 They charged that on the directions of Azam, objectionable posters carrying Adityanath's name surfaced at many places in Jianagla village, about 70 km away from Bareilly, on Monday. The posters called Muslims to leave the village immediately.
 
 "It is conspiracy against Yogiji. On the directions of Azam Khan, the posters carrying Yogiji's name were put up in Jianagla village of Bareilly. It was done to defame Yogiji. He is the head priest of Gorakhnath temple. Inside the temple campus many Muslims run their shops and many Muslim families work there. How is it is possible that Yogiji could say such a thing," Morcha district secretary Mithilesh Mal said.
 
 Morcha's district general secretary Rameshwar Kashyap also condemned the act and said it was aimed to defame Adityanath.
 
 " I don't know who put up posters in Bareilly. Anyway, I am not involved in this. It's a matter of probe to find out who is behind this," Adityanath told TOI.
