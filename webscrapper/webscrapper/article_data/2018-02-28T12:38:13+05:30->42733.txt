PATNA: The state   presented by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday evoked mixed reactions from different stakeholders.

  (BCCI) president P K Agrawal said entrepreneurs in the state expected the Budget allocation for industry sector to be doubled. “The allocation of Rs 622.04 crore will not be sufficient... Entrepreneurs were expecting that the Industrial Incentive Policy 2016 would be reviewed and incentive would be provided as per the Incentive Policy of 2011,” he said and regretted these expectations had not been fulfilled.
 
 The BCCI chief said the land registration fee was already high and its further increase would have an adverse effect on the sale and purchase of properties. “Special focus on agriculture, health, education, roads and energy sectors are a welcome move,” Agrawal said.
 
  president K P S Keshri also said the budgeted allocation of Rs 622.04 crore for the industrial sector was insufficient. He, however, applauded the allocation of Rs17,000 crore for building 1500km road.
 
 Paras HMRI Hospital’s facility director Dr Talat Halim said the government should have allocated more funds for preventive healthcare. “Although the setting up of a Combined Treatment Plant in all medical colleges and hospitals is a welcome move, the burden of communicable diseases in Bihar is high and the government should focus on this issue as well,” he said. 
 
 Dr Halim hailed the government for allocating 4.3% of the Budget for the health sector, an improvement from last year.
 
 Students sounded sceptical. “The education sector has received the biggest slice of the cake, and I hope it gets properly spent,” said Mansi Ragini, a third-year student of Patna Women’s College. 
 
 Kankerbagh resident and homemaker   hailed the Budget as a people-friendly one and said the establishment of an organic corridor was a good move. “At least the government is doing something to counter the use of insecticides in farming,” she said.
