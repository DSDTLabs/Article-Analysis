Indore: A team of members of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) that visited Indore to take stock of radiation safety measures at X-ray units here squarely blamed the state government for their apathy in regularly monitoring medical diagnostic units. As a result, most hospitals including government ones, were found violating the regulatory and radiation safety norms. “We regularly send letters and advertisements to the state government urging them to regularly monitor X-ray units being operated in the state but they do not take it seriously. On many occasions, we approached the authority to appoint radiation safety officers, ensure that there are radiation safety accessories and take other precautionary measures but to no avail” said AERB official, Pramod Dixit. “In a survey conducted by our association, about 30 employees, who used to render their services at these units, were found suffering from hazardous diseases including blood cancer, radiation dermatitis and erectile dysfunction. The state government is responsible for their condition as they did not ensure AERB’s rules and regulations in operating medical X-ray units” president of MP Radiographer Association, Shivakant Vajpai told TOI. Vajpai also held the state government responsible for showing apathy in monitoring medical diagnostic X-ray equipment. The official added that AERB’s rules are taken for granted to the extent that eight out of ten hospitals inspected by the team, including MYH and Chacha Nehru Hospital, could not produce a license for operating their X-ray units.
