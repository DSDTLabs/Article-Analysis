Vadodara: Activist and former MS University (MSU) professor J S Bandukwala was prevented from going to Kalyannagar for protesting against the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) not giving houses to persons who were ousted from the area.

 Bandukwala had left his residence in Pratapnagar on foot at around 8.15am and was detained near the Rosary School. “I was taken at a nearby house and asked to wait. Policemen were also present there,” he said adding that the police presence made it evident that he was being detained.
 
 Around 1,900 dwellings were razed in Kalyannagar and residents there were given alternate houses. But those who were given houses in Sayajipura and Kalali were not allowed to move there as they were from the minority community. It was eventually decided to give them houses at Kalyannagar itself after constructing a housing scheme for the urban poor there.
 
 VMC went back on its promise stating that extra work was conducted at site without approvals and project cost had escalated. The payments of the contractor were stopped and the contractor too stopped work on the site. The VMC now wants the families to accept houses in Tandalja even as they are insisting on the civic body keeping its promise of giving them houses in Kalyannagar. A part of the Kalyannagar land is being used for the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Sankalpbhoomi Smarak.
