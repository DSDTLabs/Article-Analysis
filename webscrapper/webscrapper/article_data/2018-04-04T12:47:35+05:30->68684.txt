AMRITSAR: As the bodies of IS victims returned from Iraq, the Punjab government claims to have begun tightening its noose around the travel agents who illegally recruit youths on false promises of well-paying jobs abroad. Those in the trade, however, said the drive could be of little help.

 “Till date, the   send youths on visitor visas to Dubai from where they are further sent to other destinations with the help of local handlers,” said a registered recruitment agent from Amritsar, who didn’t want to give his name.
 
 All the travel agents are supposed to get themselves registered under the Punjab Prevention of Human Smuggling Act, 2012 by paying a fee of Rs 1 lakh for ticketing and immigration consultation. However, they don’t need to register for recruitments.
 
 “There will not be any significant change in the scenario. The youths would continue to be tempted to go abroad, and illegal travel agents will also continue to exploit them,” said sources, adding that only safe way for the youths to go abroad was through registered recruitment agents having certificates issued from the Union ministry of external affairs.
 
 Pathankot deputy commissioner (DC) Neelima told TOI that with the efforts and awareness drive by the administration, number of registered travel agents had risen from earlier two to six. “The no objection certificate ( ) issued by district administration doesn’t allow them to recruit people but only for ticket booking or facilitation for visa,” she said.
 
  said the administration had also disposed of pending applications for the registration of travel agents and claimed that no agent would be allowed to operate illegally.
