LUCKNOW: A final year girl student of   ( ) has accused the institute's hostel administration of not allowing girls to attend coaching institutes by imposing strict timings. 

  Calling the hostel a ' ', the student in her   post alleged that girl hostellers are not given permission to come late if they join coaching institutes for competitive examinations like GATE. 
 
 She wrote: "This (hostel) is a doomed place, where I was bound to live my life for four years, and trust me, this is no more like a JAIL. I guess, the jails are even better. We, as girls, have to fight for our education even today, when they talk about about equality for both genders. I had been silent for whole three years and a few months. I am gonna be a graduate in s few months and regret the fact I was in this hostel.'' (sic). 
 
  "According to hostel rules, the hostel gate closes at 8pm and if we are late due to any reason, we have to pay penalty. The coaching timings are 6pm to 9.30pm. To extend the timings we had to take permissions, and we were granted with the same. Due to some unavoidable reasons, the permissions had been withdrawn many times. And every time, we had put extra efforts to renew our permission," she wrote. 
 
 IET director HK Paliwal said, "Girls are allowed to be out of the institute after 8pm if the reason is academic and they have parents' consent. Safety of girls is important to us."
