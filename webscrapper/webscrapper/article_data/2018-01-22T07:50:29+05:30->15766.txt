LUCKNOW: The 1983-batch IPS officer Om   is all set to take over as director general of   police on Tuesday. The Union home ministry on Sunday relieved the DGP-designate from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), where he served as director general since September 2016.

 Sources said Singh is likely to complete the exit formalities by Monday evening and may take over as UP police chief on Tuesday.
 
 Singh had been named as DGP by Yogi Adityanath government on December 31, 2017 soon after three-month extension granted to   got over. However, the appointments committee of the cabinet took time to approve the request of the UP government to release him for his state cadre delaying his taking over the topmost office in the state police.
 
 A native of Gaya in  , Singh is the fifth senior most IPS officer in the state. 
 
 The inordinate delay in issuing repatriation order by the Centre fanned speculations that the name of some other senior officer as the successor of Sulkhan Singh might spring up. The state machinery, however, swung into action and followed up with Centre's Department of Personnel and Training for quick decision. Consequently, Singh was relieved on Sunday.
 
 With his retirement due in January 2020, Singh would get enough time to bring about changes and improve policing, said a senior state government officer. 
 
 Credited with better aviation security as CISF chief, Singh's role has also been acknowledged while handling national disasters as NDRF chief. He is also known for weeding out terror elements who had shifted base to Lakhimpur Kheri and   in the early 90s from Punjab.
