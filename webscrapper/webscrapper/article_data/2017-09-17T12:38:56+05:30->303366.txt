THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   state secretariat has decided to publish the details regarding fund collected by 2,093 local committees in the state for constructing E K Nayanar Academy in Kannur. The decision is based on the controversy triggered by the opposition UDF regarding the transparency of the fund collection. On August 19, P Krishna Pillai's birth anniversary , the CPM conducted a state-wide campaign including `bucket collection' to raise funds for the memorial coming up at Payyambalam. The single day collection drive fetched Rs 20.84 crore. The CPM's traditional strongholds Kannur,   and   led the collection drive too by contributing maximum amounts.   district committee topped the contributors' list by amassing Rs 3,65,81,549.Meanwhile, Palakkad district committee collected Rs.1,91,50,984 and Alappuzha district committee collected Rs 1,76,42,714. Opposition leader   had expressed doubt about the genuineness of the figure the other day .Chennithala's allegation was that the amount was received as bribe through various ministers and the fund collection drive was used as a tool to legalize the ill-gotten money . On Saturday , Chennithala repeated the allegation and said it was against common sense to believe that Rs 20 crore was collected by `bucket collection' on a single day . “By all chances, it might have been the bribe paid by bar owners for favours received. They used this as an opportunity to convert that to white money , he alleged adding that he had high regards for Nayanar.

 Meanwhile, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan termed the allegations levelled by Chennithala as `cheap'. “The amount collected is the contribution by 4.5 lakh party members and other well-wishers. The people of Kerala supported the drive wholeheartedly ,“ he claimed.“The amount was transferred to the trust through two bank accounts, in   and Indian Bank. So far, 9,381transactions were done,“ he said.
