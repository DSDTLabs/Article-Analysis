AHMEDABAD: The demand for silver in   appears to be surpassing that of  , at least in this festive season. Against a mere 0.43MT in August, the amount of silver imported in September reached 25.56MT, almost 60 times the noble metal imported in the preceding month. Expecting high sales of silver in the festive season,   traders and jewellers have stocked up heavily.

 “In addition to purchases in the form of jewellery, Ganesha, Lakshmi idols, coins and bars, corporate gift items of silver, and also sil verware, have high demand and therefore, stockists procure in hefty quantities,“ said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
 
 Moreover, investors buy silver before   arrives. “Silver prices go up around Diwali, and therefore, investors in silver get active ahead of Diwali,“ said  , national secretary, Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association ( ).
 
 The prices of silver have remained around Rs39,500 per kg over the past couple of weeks. Around Diwali, bullion traders estimate prices of silver will touch Rs42,000 per kg. The price of the precious metal settled at Rs39, 800 per kg on Monday.
 
 Estimates by city-based bullion traders indicate that some 25% of silver has industrial applications as well and therefore it makes sense to purchase it when prices are on the lower side, and that demand could be one of the reasons for the surge in silver imports.
