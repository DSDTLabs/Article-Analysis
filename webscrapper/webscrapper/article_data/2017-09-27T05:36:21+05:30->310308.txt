MUMBAI: After eluding   for 20 years, a conman was finally arrested from J J Marg area on Monday in a joint operation by Mumbai police and Jaisalmar police.

 Sources said Sameer Ali alias Diggi (50), who lives in south Mumbai, has five to six cases of cheating, assault and fake notes registered against him. 
 
 “There was a standing warrant pending against him by a Jaipur first-class magistrate’s court in a 1997   case. We arrested him and produced him before the Jaipur court, which remanded him in judicial custody,” said superintendent of police (Rajasthan) S Gurav.
 
 In 1997, the Sangadh police in Rajasthan zeroed in on a 10-member gang that circulated fake Rs 500 notes to goat sellers. Ali, who was part of this gang, managed to give the police the slip and evaded arrest.
 
  After the demonetization last year, Ali had allegedly duped a south Mumbai businessman of nearly Rs 58 lakh. Police said Ali, along with his aide Miraj Ali and others, took banned notes from Siraj Dalal on the pretext of getting them exchanged for new currency and fled. 
 
 Ali was also arrested by JJ Marg police in 1998 in a fake currency case. He was convicted, but later managed to secure bail.
