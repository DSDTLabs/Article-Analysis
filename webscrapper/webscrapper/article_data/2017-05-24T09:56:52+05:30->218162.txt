CHANDIGARH: Appointment of senior advocate Atul Nanda as the advocate general (AG) of Punjab has been challenged before the Punjab and   high court on the grounds that it “violates mandatory constitutional provisions”. The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by advocate G S Taank.

 The petitioner told the court that Captain   and his council of ministers took oath of the office on March 16. It was alleged that Nanda was appointed as the AG by the Punjab governor without any formal resolution.
 
 “Since meeting of council of ministers was not held on March 16, 2017m and formal resolution was not approved for advising the governor of the state to appoint Nanda as the AG, his appointment was illegal, unreasonable baseless and arbitrary,” alleged the petitioner.
 
 Hearing the plea, the division bench headed by Justice S S  , however, adjourned the case for June 2 for further hearing.
