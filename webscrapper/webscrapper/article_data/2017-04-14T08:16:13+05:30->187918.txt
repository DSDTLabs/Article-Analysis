LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of high court on Wednesday set aside appointments of retired professor   and ex-director R C Yadav as chairpersons of selection committees of Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur and Bundelkhand Institute of Engineering and Technology, Jhansi, respectively. The court held that the appointments were against the byelaws and regulations, hence illegal.

 The court allowed two writ petitions moved by   of Dr   challenging the state government’s order of September 23, 2016 and November 7, 2016 to appoint the two as chairpersons of the selection committees for appointments to various teaching posts. The   VC pleaded that under the university bylaws and regulations, only he could be the chairman of such selection committees. 
 
 Allowing the petition, the bench said, “Principal secretary technical education has exceeded jurisdiction in passing the impugned appointment orders. If laws and principles are eroded by such institutions, it not only pollutes its functioning deteriorating its standard but also exhibits use of wrong channel.”
