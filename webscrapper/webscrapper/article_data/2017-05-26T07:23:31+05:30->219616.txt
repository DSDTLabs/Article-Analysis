LUCKNOW: The special   court, conducting daily hearing of the 1992 Babri demolition case, deferred framing of charges against six Sangh   leaders as just one of them appeared it on Thursday. The   asked them to be present on May 30 for framing of charges, and said no further adjournment would be allowed. 

 Six other saffron leaders — LK Advani, former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi, cabinet minister  , MP Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Ritambhara and   — would be charged for their role in the conspiracy behind the   demolition on Friday. 
 
 On Thursday, Satish Pradhan appeared before the court, saying charges should be framed against him because he was ill and unable to walk, while five accused— Nritya Gopal Das, Ram Vilas Vendanti, Baikunth Lal Sharma, Champat Rai and Dharm Das — sought exemption. But CBI judge SK Yadav turned it down, saying it was not possible to frame charges as all the accused were not present.
