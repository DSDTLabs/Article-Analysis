SOCORRO: Local residents of Maina,  , on Monday stopped illegal felling of trees in private forest land in the village.

 Villagers told TOI that the clandestine activity of felling of trees in Survey No. 307/10 in Socorro village had commenced last week, but was discovered only a few days later. Complaints were lodged by several residents to the forest department and a team of forest officials arrived at the site.
 
 The forest department team caught the labourers engaged in tree-felling red-handed. “We have compiled a report of our inspection. Accordingly, we have noted that 34 trees have been illegally felled,” forest official   said.
 
 Naik said that the forest department is ascertaining the identity of the property owner before initiating further action. Survey No. 307 has been earmarked as ‘part private forest’ by the Sawant and   committees, which were appointed by the state government to identify private forests in Goa. The said Survey No. 307/10, where the illegal tree-felling has taken place, also has a demarcation stone with ‘Private Forest 17’ engraved on it.
 
 Survey No. 307/10 is a few metres away from Survey No. 292/4 where illegal structures were constructed in 2014 on private forest land. Villagers approached the  , which passed a judgement on September 29, 2016, ordering that all structures be demolished. The state government complied with the court order and carried out the demolition later.
