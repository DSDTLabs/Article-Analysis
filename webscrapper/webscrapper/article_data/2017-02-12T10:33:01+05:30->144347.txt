LUCKNOW: After assuring police personnel withdrawal of the 'border scheme', BSP chief   on Saturday reached out to working women with the promise of posting them in the home district of their spouse if her party formed government in Uttar Pradesh. 

 The announcement was made by Mayawati during a rally in Bijnor on a day the first phase of polling took place in 73 assembly constituencies in the state.
 
 Government sources said under the present arrangement, posting of working couples in one district is subject to "as far as possible'' and added, "This leaves it to the discretion of state government. The promise means the rider will have to be removed and posting of working couples in one district will have to be made mandatory,'' a government official said.
 
  Three days ago, Mayawati had attempted to woo police with the promise of withdrawal of 'border scheme' that kept policemen from being posted in their hometown. The scheme was put in place in 2012 when Mayawati was chief minister. The BSP boss, however, maintained the scheme was enforced by then DGP without her consent. 
 
 Soon after coming to power in 2012, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav did away with the scheme but later reinstated it after incidents of police atrocities in various districts surfaced. Posting in the home range, sources said, was one of the prime demands of policemen.
 
 Former DGP, Prakash Singh said that the scheme may be popular amongst the constabulary but it will not be of much help for the people. "Local factors, essentially involving caste often dominate the priorities of policemen working in their home districts or even in their home range. That could prove detrimental for the people,'' he said.
 
 A senior BSP leader, however, said it depends on overall environment under a regime. "BSP regime is known for strictness and giving little room for policemen or any other government servant to indulge in anti-people activities,'' he said.
