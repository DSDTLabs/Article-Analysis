He played a pivotal role in putting an end to the film exhibitors' strike and now,   is back to entertain the audience with his antics on screen. 

 The actor will be working next with director Jayasurya, who made the film Speed Track with him in 2007. A suspense thriller with plenty of humour, the film is also scripted by the director. It will go on floors in August 2017.
 
 'Dileep's character is named Jack in the story,' says Jayasurya, who adds that he is a crook and a conman. 'He presents himself as a businessman and a handicraft exporter. He puts on different guises to con people. Thus, he will be seen in three looks in the film.' 
 
 The film has an urban setting and Dileep's looks will be stylish. 'The movie is about how the protagonist brilliantly executes a plan that he has in his mind. He gets things done his way in a hilarious manner but the film's humour isn't forcibly created by comedians,' says the director.
 The movie, which is untitled as of now, has Ernakulam, Goa and Trivandrum as its main locations.
