CHENNAI: Complaints against Tamil Nadu Ex-Servicemen's Corporation Limited ( ) tasked with collecting fees at the corporation run parking spaces continue to pour in with motorists saying they are being asked to shell out sums more than that fixed by the civic body.

 At several places where parking for four-wheelers is as low at Rs5 for six hours and Rs20 for more than six hours, people say they are being charged Rs20 for six hours.
 
 “I was handed over this parking slip after the man struck off the detail about the time limit using a pen,“ said Siddharth M, a visitor to   beach. To tackle issues where the public are swindled by TEXCO men, activist   used to turn up with her friend at Besant Nagar where these men were collecting money.
 
  “A friend of mine and I used to hide and follow these men and pop up while they would charge people and show people the charges mentioned on the corporation website. That's only so much I could do. Fleecing persists, “ said Shanthi.
 
 The automatic parking meters installed at several places are not in working condition, and authorities su spect they might have been vandalised by the parking attendants themselves.
 
 Shanthi added that the machines that shell out tokens charging `5 per hour have been rendered useless using chewing gum or by pouring hot water into it. 
 
 In  , for instance, near the Fortis Malar hospital, despite the parking meter being present, a TEXCO staffer is always around. 
 
 Asked why he was charging more than the fixed parking fee, he refused to answer and left the spot. Across the city, there are 103 parking spots currently that are being manned by staffers of neither TEXCO but neither the Corporation nor TEXCO officials are taking charge of the complaints brought to their notice.
 
  A senior official at TEXCO, when contacted said that there are eight inspectors doing rounds each day to check the parking facilities and checking the fee collection.
