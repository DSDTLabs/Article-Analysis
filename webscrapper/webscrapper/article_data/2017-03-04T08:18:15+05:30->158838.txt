SURAT: Two city-based doctors facing charges of   after the death of a pregnant woman in   area of the city were acquitted by additional sessions judge Rahul Trivedi here on Friday.

 A 14-week pregnant woman, residing in Limbayat, had visited Aires Hospital run by Dr Kallol Mallick and Dr Sanjay Paatil for abortion on March 23, 2015. After preliminary examination, the woman was allowed to go home. On the same night, the woman breathed her last at her home in Limbayat. 
 
 The family members of the deceased woman registered a complaint under section 304 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, which was enacted by   in 1971 to reduce the incidence of illegal abortion and consequent maternal mortality and morbidity. Both the doctors were arrested by Limbayat police and sent to judicial custody for 15 days. 
 
 The final hearing of the case was held by additional sessions judge Rahul Trivedi, who acquitted both the doctors on the grounds that there was no surgical abortion and that the doctors did not have any degree in gynaecology.   legal expert Dr Vinesh Shah and advocate Vinay Shukla appeared before the court on behalf of the accused doctors. 
 
 Dr Vinesh Shah said, “The post-mortem report submitted by the government hospital and the charges levelled by the complainant were contradictory.”
