THANE: In August last year, Kendriya   school, near the   station, suspended classes indefinitely as authorities suggested that the students be relocated from the three-storey ‘unsafe’ school building. 

 What followed was a year of having to shift classrooms now and then, juggle class schedules and miss out on weekly test because of the repair work. 
 
 However, beating all odds, Thane’s lone CBSE affiliated KV school with 85 Class XII students scored 100% results for the first time in the past four years. Titiksha   (94%), who topped the college in commerce, said, “Our teachers would wait back after school for extra classes and ensured that our entire portion was covered. Their hard work motivated us.” 
 
 “A camp was organised by the school for students of classes X and XII and that helped us gain clarity. The principal also personally met the students and ensured that they were stress-free,” said Dr R Verma, parent of science student   who secured 65%. Speaking about the school’s result, principal   said, “We had 30 students in the commerce Class XII batch and 55 students in the science batch. We are delighted that each one of them has cleared the exams with flying colours. 
 
 Despite going through a rough patch this year, we pulled through mainly because of the guidance of our regional office, and extra efforts put in by our students and academics, defying the odds to emerge successful.”
