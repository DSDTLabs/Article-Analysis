BENGALURU: All ward offices of Bruhat Bengaluru   (BBMP) will be equipped with   cameras soon. 

  In the wake of the recent fracas involving   leader K Narayanaswamy, who threatened to set the KR Puram BBMP office on fire, BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad asked his officials to have CCTV cameras installed to keep a close vigil on visitors. This will apply to all BBMP offices spread over 198 wards, which serve as decentralized contact points for citizens. 
 
  The BBMP commissioner said CCTVs serve as a deterrent for criminals. "The cameras will record high-definition images," he said. An official said the footage will be monitored from the BBMP headquarters as well as the jurisdictional police stations of the ward offices. 
 
 
 
 In addition to ward offices, BBMP is installing about 3,000 CCTV cameras at a total cost of Rs 20crore to keep vigil at garbage black spots and places where citizens dump waste.
 
 K Narayanaswamy, former president of KR Puram Block Congress and close aide of KR Puram MLA Byrathi Basavaraj, had walked into the K R Puram BBMP office with a bottle of petrol, sprinkled the fuel all over the office and threatened the assistant revenue officer that he would set the office ablaze.
 
 He has since been suspended by the party and is on the run.
 
 Mayor R Sampath Raj said the installation of CCTV cameras was an ongoing project and has nothing to do with the KR Puram incident.
