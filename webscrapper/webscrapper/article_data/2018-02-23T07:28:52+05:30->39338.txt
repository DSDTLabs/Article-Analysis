HYDERABAD: While the high potential stretch between Ameerpet and   in   is expected to be ready by June this year, municipal administration minister   has asked the Hyderabad   officials to take up works on the extended stretch from Shilparamam to   immediately. 

 The stretch from Shilparamam to Raidurg was not included in the project envisaged eight years ago. But due to the expansion of IT corridor, it was decided to extend the Metro Rail. On the request of the state government, Metro Rail project developer L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad agreed to take up the additional stretch. 
 
 L&T reportedly sought an additional cost of about 400 crore for the two kilometres stretch. The government has decided to offer land for transit-oriented development along the stretch. 
 
 "A formal foundation stone laying ceremony for the extended 2km stretch is being planned," a government source said. 
 
 Following the request of the government, L&T authorities have assured completion of the extended stretch by the end of this year. "Since there is no problem of land acquisition, it may be completed before the year-end also," an official of HMRL said.
