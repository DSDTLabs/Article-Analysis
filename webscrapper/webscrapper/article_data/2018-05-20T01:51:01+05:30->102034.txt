GHAZIABAD:   Nand Kishore Gujjar on Saturday complained to chief minister Yogi Adityanath saying that some cops in the three police stations in his constituency are involved in  . In a letter to Yogi, he has alleged that the administration has taken no action in the matter despite repeated complaints.

 Gujjar also sent across audio clips and a complaint letter, which purportedly are conversations by cops demanding money on various pretexts.
 
 “Last week, cops from Loni police station extorted Rs 13,000 from a tractor owner after an accident with an auto even though both had settled it out of court. Cops also took away a battery worth around Rs 20,000 from the tractor. On May 17, cops from Loni Border police station picked up workers sleeping at night in a factory that has already been sealed by the administration for causing pollution. They were let off only after its owner coughed up Rs 40,000. The audio conversations between the cops and the factory owner are there for evidence,” Gujjar told TOI.
 
 On Saturday, Gujjar had also met DM   demanding a probe into the incidents and legal action against the cops. A senior police official said a probe has already been initiated on the basis of the complaints.
