NEW DELHI: “We must rise against divisive forces. People and parties are trying to divide the nation on grounds of caste and religion and we must raise our voice against hate crimes,” was Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s response to a   student’s phone-in question on what he had to say about a “section of people” trying to spread hatred in the country. Sending out a larger message to the youth on Valentine’s Day, Kejriwal said that violence could be countered only by love. “Violence cannot be the answer to violence,” he declared.

 Answering questions put to him on phone, Twitter and Facebook at an event on Wednesday to celebrate the three years of the Aam   government, Kejriwal, however, refrained from blaming any political party for the hate crimes. “Divisive politics is being played out in the country. It is a cause of concern for every citizen,” he told the DU girl student.
 
 The government also discussed women’s safety on the occasion. Kejriwal said the installation of CCTV cameras across the city, likely to start from next month, would be a deterrent against sexual violence, but, he added, gender crime would not halt unless the perpetrators were dealt with quickly. “Fear in the minds of the perpetrators can play a big role in checking sexual violence,” he said as he urged Delhi Police to work aggressively to ensure the guilty were punished.
 
 To help aid in preventing sexual crimes, the CM said, the government would put aside a special fund in this year’s budget for the installation of street lights at dark spots in the city. “The civic bodies have identified and illuminated several dark spots, and PWD too has installed 8,000 lights in such places,” he said.
 
 Claiming to have checked corruption, Kejriwal said it had become difficult to do so after the Anti-Corruption Branch was removed from the jurisdiction of Delhi government. “I hope ACB will be given back to us so we can crack down on corruption,” the CM said.
