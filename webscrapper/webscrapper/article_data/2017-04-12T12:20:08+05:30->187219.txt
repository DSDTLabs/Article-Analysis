AHMEDABAD: If you meet Riya Korat, 30, wife of   Vikram, 36, from Surat, who speaks Gujarati with a  , you might be surprised to learn she is an Oriya who has just spent three years in  . 

 She, however, claims that it only took her a month to master the language.
 
 “A few years ago, such inter-state marriages were not common and I was also full of apprehensions when I came to Surat,” said Riya at a mass wedding ceremony of Gujarati grooms and   at Nikol on Tuesday, where she was one of the 12 facilitators.
 
 “Right from food to routine, everything was different, but I got support from my ‘swami’ (husband) as I slowly adopted the culture and society,” Riya said.
  
  
 
 It’s a trend none of the parties are in mood to break. To overcome skewed sex ratio and exorbitant dowry demands, the communities have devised a way to forge unlikely alliances. 
 
 Kanu Patel, a Patidar community leader and one of the organizers of the event, is a foster father of one of the 23 girls who got married to youths from Ahmedabad. 
 
 “We have devised a system where all the girls have foster parents here, whom they can go to for any issue. Many such parents actually participated in ‘kanya daan’ on Tuesday,” Patel said.
 
 “Moreover, the brides had freedom to choose whom to marry and not vice-versa. The meetings had taken place between the families over the past week,” he added.
 
 On the other hand, the 100-odd girls married in Surat are now seen as ‘ambassadors’ in their community. 
 
 Nikhila Utkal Kurmi Kshatriya Pradesh Sanstha, based in Ganjam, has made video CDs of the lives of Oriya girls settled in Surat depicting their experiences and better lives. 
 
 “We encourage the trend as it not only bonds the Kurmi community on a national level, it also reduces local demands for dowry,” said Shivram Nayak, secretary of the organization.
