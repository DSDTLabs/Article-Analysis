PUNE: Third-year   at   ( ) have complained about an out-ofsyllabus question in their fifth semester ‘legal writing’ paper.

 The students brought the error to the notice of the examination department at the university, but no action has been taken yet. Students have demanded that those who attempted the out-of-syllabus question should be given full marks, as is done in similar situations for exams in engineering and other streams. University officials, meanwhile, said the paper will be reviewed on the basis of the students’ complaints.
 
 
 A student, Abhishek Raskar, said, “Question number 4 was from outside the syllabus. The examination got over on November 6, 2017. I gave a written application to the SPPU on November 9 in which I had clearly pointed out this error. But the authorities have not taken any action.” 
  
 
 The results were declared in January, after which many students applied for photocopies of the answer sheets. The process took time, so the students sought information — under the   (RTI) — from the examination department of the university. They wanted to know about the marking for question number 4. However, the students did not receive any response.
 
 Raskar added, “We received a photocopy two weeks ago, and when we compared the answer sheets, the out-ofsyllabus question had been marked arbitrarily. The question was worth a total of 16 marks. Some students had received 10 marks while some others had received 6. A few had even received full marks.”
 
 Ashok Chavan, the controller of the examination department at SPPU, said, “I will have to speak to my subordinates as I am on leave.”
