AHMEDABAD: Each year, many who are in their fifties and sixties visit the municipal registrar of births and deaths for a copy of their duplicate certificates. They have to either confront a “no record” notice or deal with the setback of learning that their records have been damaged. The next step is to approach civil courts to get a “no records” certificate. The process requires lawyer fees of Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000.

 Citizens would not have faced this ordeal if local bodies across   had conducted a detailed scrutiny of physical forms of all records five years ago. On May 8, 2012, deputy chief registrar   had circulated a notification to all municipal corporations, collectorates, and municipalities that local birth and death registration offices should conduct a detailed scrutiny of all records stored in the physical form and inform the public every year of damaged records.
 
 The notification was recently obtained with an   query by a Kalupur resident, Pankaj Bhatt. “Had the registrars’ offices complied with the notification, thousands of individuals would not have had to spend thousands on advocate fees to get “no record” certificates from civil courts,”   said. According to this notification, local bodies had to come out with a public notice mentioning the year of the record stacks that have been damaged and to call for documentary evidence from people to update their own damaged records. 
 
 In a subsequent notification passed on February 2, 2016, chief registrar J P Gupta repeated the directions and even passed instructions on name corrections in records and the documents that should be accepted as proof for the purpose.
