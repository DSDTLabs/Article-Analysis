THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finally there is a ray of hope for 29-year-old Sreejith, who is staging a protest in front of the secretariat seeking justice for his brother Sreejeev, who died in police custody allegedly following torture. MLA   has promised help and support for his struggle. 

 George, who visited Sreejith on last Wednesday, had promised to raise the issue in the assembly and offered to join Sreejith in the   if there was no response from the government. 
 
 Sreejeev died on May 21, 2014 while he was in the custody of Parassala police allegedly due to torture. But the police officials maintained that he had consumed poison which lead to his death.
 
  “Even after the police complaints authority has named Parassala circle inspector Gopakumar, sub inspector Philippose and civil police officers Prathapachandran and Vijayadas responsible for the death of my brother, no action was taken against them so far,” said Sreejith. He has been holding the protest for the past 458 days. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, the P C George said that he would meet chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on and inquire about the reason for the delay in taking heed of the protest of Sreejith. “Even the report filed by DGP after detailed inquiry clearly says that the police officers are guilty,” he said.
 
 The MLA intervened soon after actor and social activist T Parvathy streamed a live video of Sreejith and his mother in Facebook.
