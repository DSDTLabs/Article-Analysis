CHENNAI: Pro-democracy outfits have demanded the use of voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in accordance with the 2013 Supreme Court order, which ruled that all electronic voting machines (EVMs) will be accompanied by VVPAT by 2019 General Elections. 

 Retired IAS officer  , who chaired a discussion on 'Key to a Vibrant Democracy' at SBOA School & Junior College on Wednesday, accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of negating the apex court judgment. 
 
 Devasagayam said, "ECI has directed the chief electoral officers in all states and Union territories to verify VVPAT paper slips in only one randomly selected polling station in each of the assembly constituencies. Failing to implement the SC order will have a severe impact on electoral integrity." 
 
 VVPAT, which helps the voter verify if his vote has been cast against the right candidate, was introduced to prevent tampering of EVMs and ensure transparency in counting of votes.
 
  said that inner party democracy is absent in political parties. "Lakhs of general council members happen to pick the same candidate. It is always a unanimous decision."
 
 A member of Arappor Iyakkam and a former member of Aam Aadmi Party, Chandramohan, said, "Studies show that your chance of entering politics is 14% higher if you have a criminal record. Voters have got into the bad habit of voting for symbols without knowing anything about the candidate. EC releases the affidavit submitted by each candidate 2-3 weeks prior to the election. The voter must use the time to survey his options."
