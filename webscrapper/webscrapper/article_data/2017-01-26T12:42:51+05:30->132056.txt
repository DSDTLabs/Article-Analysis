GORAKHPUR: Discontentment among   (BJP) cadre over a large number of outsiders being given party tickets sparked large-scale protests in various areas of Gorakhpur, Deoria and Kushinagar districts on Wednesday. 

 BJP’s decision to field Vipin Singh from Gorakhpur rural seat apparently did not go down well with the local members. Supporters of Ram Bhual Nishad burnt an effigy of Gorakhnath MP Yogi Adityanath. 
 
  In Deoria, a group unidentified people pasted objectionable posters of Union minister Kalraj Misra. While in Kushinagar district, supporters of Nand Kishore Misra resigned from BJP membership as a sign of   as Jagdish Misra aka Balti Baba was given a ticket from Tamkuhiraj seat in Kushinagar district. BJP workers in Padrauna are not happy with the saffron party’s decision to field former BSP leader, Swami Prasad Maurya, as they see him as an ‘outsider’.
 
 “The party has ignored the Nishad community and we see it as a sign of disrespect to our community. I will not contest the election as an independent but will work agaianst BJP candidates and I’m sure that their defeat in Pipraich, Gorakhpur rural, Chauri Chaura and Campierganj is certain.” Ram Bhual Nishad said. Nishad contested on a   ticket in the 2012 elections from Gorakhpur rural seat and polled over 41,000 votes, before switching to BJP later. Sources said Nishad was expected to contest from either Chauri Chaura or Gorakhpur rural.
 
 “I will contest as an independent from Tamkuhiraj seat in the election on people’s demand,” said Nand Kishore Mishra said. “Many workers have resigned from party membership and it’s their discretion. As far as I am concerned I will always obey the party command’s orders,” said president of BJP Kushinagar unit,   Shahi.
