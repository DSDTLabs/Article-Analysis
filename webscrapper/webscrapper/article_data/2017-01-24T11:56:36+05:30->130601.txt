BENGALURU: 
 

 Yes. We've been sharing a love-hate relationship for some time but it was all issue-based and nothing personal. I have never made any personal comments against Yeddyurappa, which shows I have respect for him.
 
 
 
 
 The situation has come to such a pass that it cannot to be sort ed out on a one-on-one basis. It's either RSS or nation al lead ers who should intervene to bring about a truce, since there are several issues that need to be looked into to put the state unit back on track. Especially if we have to achieve the goal of winning the 2018 assembly poll.
 
 
 
 
 Such veiled threats hold no water unless he understands the issue.   is an apolitical organization.How can anybody stop me from attending a function of an organization when it can benefit the party? When Yeddyurappa can attend a Lingayat convention and   a Brahmin convention, why can't I attend an Other Backward Classes (OBC) convention when they look up to me?
 
 
 
 Yeddyurappa is known for making such hasty comments.Before leaving the BJP and floating KJP, he had said he will not leave the BJP till his last breath, and before rejoining the BJP , he had made the same pledge. So it's better not to take his pledge seriously.
 
 
 
 
 They are in no way connected to my fight. I have developed a reputation as an independent thinker in the party and don't hesitate to speak my mind, even if it means ploughing a lonely furrow. I don't want to react to such baseless allegations and reports.
