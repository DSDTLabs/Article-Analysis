PATNA: Unidentified armed criminals shot dead Ram Janaki Muth’s head   Mouni Baba (70) at   under the   police station area in   district on Saturday midnight. His colleague   Baba (60) alias Chotan Das also received gunshot injuries. Chotan was taken to NMCH in Patna from where he was referred to PMCH for better treatment.

 Raghopur police station SHO   said the deceased was originally a ‘naga’ priest and had settled around 2km from Mirampur 30 years ago. Two empty cartridges of .315 bore were recovered from the spot, indicating the use of country-made firearms in the incident. No one was arrested till Sunday evening.
 
 “Mouni Baba and Chotan Baba were fast asleep on the ground floor while another priest, Shrimal Rai (70), was sleeping on the first floor of the temple under construction,” the SHO said quoting the two survivors. He said the temple is being constructed on around two bigha land. He said land mafia might be behind the crime.
 
 “The criminals shot the head priest at close range. Perhaps they also attacked him after shooting, because his face was mutilated,” the SHO said.
 
 He said Chotan woke up and when he shouted for help, the criminals shot him too. “The bullet pierced his right arm and entered his chest,”   said, adding that Shrimal ran down from the first floor on hearing Chotan’s scream.
 
 The SHO said as the temple was situated far from population, the two survivors stayed whole night inside the temple out of fear. “They only went to the village at around 8am and the police were informed,” he said.
 
 “Villagers’ rush to the temple damaged the forensic evidence and sniffer dogs could not be used,” he said, adding the priest had no enmity with anyone.
