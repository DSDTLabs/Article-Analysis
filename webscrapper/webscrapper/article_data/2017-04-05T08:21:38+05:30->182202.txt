DUMKA/RANCHI:   Mukti Morcha ( ) on Tuesday claimed that the   (EC) has sent the electronic voting machines (EVMs) used in the recent   election for the April 9   assembly bypoll in the state. 

 JMM faces   in Littipara, which it had won in 2014. The bypoll was necessitated after the death of sitting JMM MLA Anil Murmu. Of the two widows of Murmu, Uniki Hansda joined BJP after JMM fielded Simon Marandi as its candidate in Littipara. Hemlal Murmu is BJP’s candidate. 
 
 “I have concrete information that the EVMs sent here had been used in the UP assembly election. These EVMs are under the scanner because of allegations that they were tampered with to help BJP,” JMM working president and former chief minister   told the media in Dumka. He demanded that ballot papers, instead of EVMs, be used in the bypoll.
 
 On Tuesday, JMM sent a letter to the EC asking it to declare where the EVMs have been brought from and where they were last time. It said there is “a grave concern that the 272 EVMs and voter verified paper audit trail machines to be used in Littipara have been tampered with to favour BJP.”
 
 Last week, JMM had asked the EC to postpone Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sahibganj on April 6, three days before the byelection. It had called the PM’s visit “a violation of the model code of conduct.” On Tuesday, Soren, who is in Dumka, reiterated JMM’s charge that the PM’s visit is in violation of the model code of conduct. 
 
 Three JMM legislators — Kunal Sharangi, Amit Mahto and Yogendra Prasad — on Tuesday staged a dharna outside the office of state chief electoral officer L Khyangte at Dhurwa in Ranchi to press for the postponement of Modi’s visit till April 14, when the result of the bypoll will be announced.
