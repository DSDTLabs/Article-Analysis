AHMEDABAD: A quick mid-air decision by the pilots of the   (IAF) helped rescue a 17-year-old boy with multiple fractures in flood-ravaged   district on Saturday evening. 

 At around 6:15pm, the disaster relief cell set up by the   (SWAC) received a call from the state administration that a 17-year-old boy Bheema was stranded in flood waters at Bismillahgadh village of Patan. The message was passed to the pilot of MI175V helicopter Wing Commander Vikram Thigaraman who was on the job of dropping food packets in the district.
 
 Moreover, this particular aircraft did not have a cradle and other equipment for winching stranded persons. 
 
 "We took a decision mid-air to attach these equipment. The challenge was to do it within 15 minutes as the daylight was fading fast and there was thick cloud cover too. Moreover, there is no scope for error as the rescue attempt could fail and prove dangerous for the victim," Thigaraman told TOI. 
 
 Besides this, the other challenge was finding a proper place to hover around as there were many high-tension cables and windmills around. 
 
 "However, we did it quickly and lifted Bheema and his father by 6:55pm," he added.
 
 Thigaraman was accompanied by co-pilot Squadron Leader Mohit Lamoriya, sergeants Riyazuddin and M Behra and corporal Mahesh. 
 
 Bheema, who had multiple fractures in his lower body, and his father were taken to the medical camp in Thara.
 
 This is the first time in rescue operation that the IAF choppers are operating from civil bases in Deesa, Mehsana and Ahmedabad.
 
 The choppers of 158 HU Falphions unit of IAF have rescued and evacuated 850 people from flood-ravaged districts of the state since July 21.
