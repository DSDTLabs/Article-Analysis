HYDERABAD:   President   on Friday offered to strengthen ties with India and said bilateral cooperation would help New Delhi and Tehran achieve their common goals. "Iran desires to continue bolstering its bilateral relationship with India," he said.

 
 Predicting a bright future for Muslims, he said this century belongs to Asia, and India and Iran will play the role of torchbearers. He criticised the US for denying visa to citizens of some Muslim nations and called upon Muslims to go to the root of Islam to fight terrorism.
 
 Mecca Masjid, built by the Qutub Shahi rulers about four centuries ago, is held in high esteem by Muslims of Hyderabad and other parts of the Deccan plateau. This is the first time that the head of a foreign country has addressed Muslims from the   at a Friday congregation. Rouhani reminded the gathering that the mosque was witness to friendly ties between the people of Iran and Hyderabad and south India for more than 400 years.
 
 He said some youths had taken to terrorism as the Muslim leadership failed to imbibe in them the teachings of peace and love enshrined in Islam. "If a part of Muslim society in the Islamic world today is suffering from a problem, it is because Islam's teachings and advice are not acted upon and that real Islam is not dominant," the Iranian president said.
