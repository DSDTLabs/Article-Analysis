KOLKATA: The mercury slid by two-and-a-half degrees leaving Kolkata to feel the chill on Friday. With the chilly north-westerly winds blowing in, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 13.5 degree Celsius. It is set drop further over the weekend which could see the mercury plunge below 12 degrees, said the   (RMC). 

 But the warmth could return on Monday under the influence of an approaching western disturbance (WD). “The temperature could drop to 12 degrees on Saturday. A further drop is not being ruled out since icy winds from the north are still flowing in. It remains very cold in the neighbouring states of Bihar and Jharkhand. The conditions are bound to be similar in south Bengal,” said  , director, RMC.
 
 An approaching WD, however, could put the cold spell to an abrupt end on Monday. “The WD is now stationed near Jammu & Kashmir. Once it nears Uttar Pradesh, the impact could be felt across the region. It will block the north-westerly and pull the mercury up. Depending on the period it lingers, there could be stray showers. But it’s still too early to predict,” said Das.
 
 Earlier this week, a WD had triggered showers in the western districts of  ,  , Burdwan and Purulia. It also pulled the mercury up, blocking the north-westerly.
