KOLKATA:   dug through its archives to trace Ritwik Ghatak’s sole radio play titled ‘Jala’, 40 years after the filmmaker passed away on February 6, 1976. On Tuesday,   commissioned a special Ghatak programme on the unheard behind-the-recording anecdotes of this play. This programme, along with the play, will be aired on Ghatak’s birth anniversary on November 4 this year.

 Though Ghatak wrote ‘Jala’ in 1950, he recorded it on August 30, 1967. “In the preface for the play, Ghatak mentioned ‘Jala’ has traces of ‘Bury The Dead’. ‘Jala’ takes off from a few incidents of suicides reported in Kolkata and depicts the dead narrating the circumstances of their death,” said  , programme executive of drama and literary sections of Akashvani Kolkata.
 
 According to Ajit Kr Mukherji (81), who was then asked by Akashvani to assist Ghatak, it took 15 days to complete the rehearsal and recording of this 48.30 minute play. The cast included Sudhir Chowdhury, Shyamal Sen, Kali Banerjee, Gita Dey, Debi Niyogi and Tapas Bhattacharya. Prabir Mazumdar was the music director. “However, Ghatak was just not happy with the recording of a humming tune by a famous singer of that era. Miffed, he cut the singer short and said: ‘Is this called humming? I will slap you if you sing this way’. We were all aghast. But more surprises were in store when Ghatak asked us to record just when she had begun sobbing,” Mukherji said.
 
 Both Mazumdar and Mukherji protested but he didn’t listen. “Once the recording was over, he told the singer: ‘Maa, I hope you didn’t mind my scolding. I wanted your voice to be soaked in sadness when you recorded the humming’. That was Ghatak’s level of perfection,” Mukherji said.
