HARIDWAR: A three-day   cum workshop on '  practices in tourism and hospitality sector in the Himalayan states' was inaugurated in Rishikesh on Friday. Sponsored by the Union ministry of tourism, the event is being held under the aegis of the  's centre for mountain tourism and hospitality studies, from April 28 to 30. 

  On day one, drawing attention to Uttarakhand's rich biodiversity, speakers at the seminar stressed the need for linking tourism to biodiversity to make it sustainable. "There are over 380 prime cultivars (wild species of plants) in the state, 520 species of butterflies, beautiful mountain peaks, fascinating forests at high altitudes and alpine meadows called bugyals which make the Himalayan region a vast storehouse of beauty. Foreigners and Indian tourists should be shown these sights instead of being taken to Mussoorie, Nainital or other places," said professor  , a noted forest historian.
