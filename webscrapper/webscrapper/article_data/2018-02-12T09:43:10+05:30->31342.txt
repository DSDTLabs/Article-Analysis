LUCKNOW: Chief minister   Adityanath’s popularity has been on the ascendant and  , not oblivious of this perception, now plans to encash his star appeal in the Northeastern state of   where elections are to be held on February 18.

 Earlier, Yogi was scheduled to visit Tripura for a day on February 13 and address rallies, but the party has now asked him to make it a twoday visit beginning February 12 and hold a road show also.
 
 On February 12, Yogi would first go to Gorakhnath Temple at Dharmnagar in Tripura, offer prayers and then embark upon a road show to Jubrajnagar. He would address rallies at Kamalpur, Kanchanpur and Jubrajnagar. The UP CM would then visit another Gorakhnath Temple at Majlispur and offer prayers.
 
 BJP feels that Yogi’s visit could sway voters in its favour as many people in Tripura are followers of the Nath sect.
 
 Yogi would be holding a rath yatra from Majlispur to Khayerpur where he would hold a rally and then proceed for Agartala.
 
 On February 13, he would be addressing three rallies after offering prayers at Udaipur Temple in Matarbari. Yogi would then address a rally in support of BJP’s Biplab Kumar Ghosh in Matarbari assembly constituency in   district and then campaign for Shankar Roy in Sabroom.
 
 He would then leave for   assembly constituency and address a rally in support of party candidate Bhagaban Das.
 
 BJP leadership believes that it is in a position to uproot Manik Sarkar’s Left government. Sarkar has been CM since 1998.
