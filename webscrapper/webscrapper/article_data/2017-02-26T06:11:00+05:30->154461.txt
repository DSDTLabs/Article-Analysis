Nagpur: Ashutosh Tripathi, the plant head of Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M & M) unit here, took over as the   of CII’s Zonal council. He has moved ahead from the post of vice-chairman, taking over from Nitin Deveshwar, who had headed CII’s Vidarbha zonal council for last two years.

 A panel discussion on sustainable growth of micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) was also held along with the change of guard function on Friday.
 
 Talking to TOI at sidelines of the meet Tripathi said one of the core areas during his tenure will be start-ups. “Start-ups will not mean those having a sizeable business alone. Even the smallest of the small with capital running into lakhs will be considered,” he said. 
 
 GST and warehousing will also be one of the focus areas. With GST regime set to come in, Nagpur is expected to emerge as a major hub for warehousing business. A vendor development meet for the auto sector has been planned for the year apart from other activities, he said.
 
 On business prospects in the region, he said Vidarbha appears to be the most favourable investment destination due to the cheapest rates of land in the state. The power tariff which was higher as compared to other states has been reduced for Vidarbha and Marathwada regions.
 
 Rahul Dixit, the director of Midland Diesel Services at Hingna who took over as the zonal vice-chairman, said apart from having more members the stress will be on developing ancillary for the defence sector.
 
 With Vidarbha emerging as a major hub for defence sector, small scale industries have a chance to become ancillary units to a main industry. Apart from private players like Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) which has taken up land in the Mihan-SEZ, the ordnance factories spread across the region also give scope for ancillarisation, he said.
