CHANDIGARH: The Tata group's most ambitious   project near Chandigarh ­ the Rs 1,800-crore Tata Camelot at   ­ has landed in deep trouble with the Delhi   on Wednesday cancelling all clearances given by the  

 The court ruled that the project fell “within the catchment area of Sukhna lake“ and said that all environmental clearances given by Punjab in September 2013 were invalid. The verdict said that the clearances were given without any scientific assessment or considering the ecological degradation.
 
 A Tata Housing spokesperson said, “We are study ing the final order from the court and will take appropriate measures post the same.“
 
 The project was seen as threatening the very character of Chandigarh as it would have hindered the view of the Shivalik ranges from the Capitol Complex, which is now a Unesco world heritage site. This was one of the arguments in the PIL challenging the project by Sarin Memorial Legal Aid Foundation and others. The petition had quoted founding architect Le Corbusier's `Edict of Chandigarh' and his desire that nothing should come in the way of the mountains and the city .
 
 In its 169-page verdict, the division bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Aalok Shahai Endlaw rejected the contention that the project ran counter to the edict but chose to focus on its possible ecological impact.
