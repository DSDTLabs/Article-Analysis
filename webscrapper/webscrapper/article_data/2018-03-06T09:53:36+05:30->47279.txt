NAGPUR: The District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum has directed the   ( ) to pay Rs7,500 to its customer for wrongfully updating his credit report even after the loan amount was paid.

 The panel comprising president   and member Nitin Gharde were granted a month to pay the amount for allegedly meting out physical and mental harassment, along with litigation costs.
 
 The customer had drawn a loan from SBI’s branch in Dharampeth under a ‘one-time agreement scheme’. He repaid the entire loan amount at one of the bank’s branches in   on March 14, 2014.
 
 On April 19, 2014, SBI’s   branch issued a ‘no due certificate’ (NDC) to the customer. The Amravati branch later notified other branches that the entire loan amount was repaid. However, on September 1, 2015, the Dharampeth branch issued him a notice for repayment of the loan amount of Rs56,776 and also warned of initiating action under SARFESI Act.
 
 The complainant invoked Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and filed a complaint before the forum. He claimed that the bank submitted wrong report to   (CIBIL) which impacted his credit score and prayed the bank to correct it.
 
 In response to the forum’s notice, the Dharampeth branch stated that the complainant’s credit score was impacted because he defaulted on his loan repayments since the last 10 years. The respondents’ claimed that the complainant had lodged false complaint and sought to dismiss it.
 
 The forum observed that the bank failed to satisfactorily explain reasons why the notice was issued if ‘no due certificate’ was issued to the complainant. Based on the document submitted as evidence, the forum concluded that the SBI had unfairly and wrongfully handled its customer.
 
 While partly allowing the complaint, the forum directed the bank to pay Rs5,000 towards physical and mental harassment as well as Rs2,500 towards litigation costs.
