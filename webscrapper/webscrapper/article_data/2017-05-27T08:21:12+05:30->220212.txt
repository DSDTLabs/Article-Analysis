MUMBAI: Boosted by strong buying momentum across all sectors except healthcare, the   scaled the 31k peak for the first time in history and closed 278 points higher at 31,028. The   on NSE too went past the 9,600 mark for the first time but closed a tad off, at 9,595 — up 85 points on the day. 

 With the index gaining a little over 700 points (2.4%) in two sessions, a section of market players has turned cautious, expecting at least a small correction in the sensex and Nifty before further upmove. They also pointed out that Friday’s gains came despite a Rs 274-crore net selling by foreign funds. In addition, midcap and smallcap   are already witnessing some profit-taking, which could now spill over to largecap stocks soon. 
 
 “We had a sharp upmove over the last two days, coupled with short-covering on derivatives expiry and also some euphoria,” said Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS. “Now markets need to consolidate if this rally has to sustain,” he added.
 
 
  data showed that it took 22 trading sessions to rally from 30,000 to 31,000, compared to 558 trading sessions to reach 30,000 from 29,000, and 51 days from 28,000 to 29,000. Official data also showed that while between April 26, the day sensex closed above the 30,000 mark for the first time, and May 26, the day it closed above the 31,000-mark for the first time, it gained 3%, BSE’s midcap index lost 1.6% and the smallcap index 1.3%. 
 
 Although midcap stocks recovered a bit on Friday, dealers said this divergence between the sensex and other indices over the last one month indicated that weak hands, who largely invest in small and midcap stocks, are slowly taking money off the table since leading indices are at an all-time peak.
 
 In Friday’s session, Tata Steel was the top sensex gainer, closing with a 5.5% gain while ITC closed 3% higher and Reliance 2.5%. Among the laggards were Sun Pharma, down 3.9% and Cipla, down 2.5%.
