VARANASI: “Aaj Nirbhaya ko sachchi shradhanjali mili hai, ab uski atma ko shanti milegi, (It is a true tribute to Nirbhaya, now her soul will rest in peace),” it was the first reaction of Nirbhaya’s grandfather Lalji Singh after the   on Friday upheld the death penalty for the four convicts for gangrape and murder on Nirbhaya case.

 Nirbhaya’s kin in her ancestral village   in   district welcomed the court’s verdict as a true tribute to the 23-year-old ill-fated paramedic, who was was gang-raped and brutalized with an iron rod on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16, 2012. Later, she died in a Singapore hospital on December 29, 2012.
 
 The natives of Medaura Kalan, who were shocked over Nirbhaya’s ordeal, are today satisfied with the court’s verdict. “We had full faith in judges, and had a firm belief that the court would upheld the death sentence to those brutes, who have no right to live in the society,” said elderly Lalji. Nirbhaya’s uncle Suresh Kumar Singh said they had been waiting for the capital punishment for those inhuman beings.
 
 “Nirbhaya ko court se to shradhanjali mil gayi, lekin rajnetaon aur sarkar ne jo wade kiye the who abhi bhi pure nahi huye hain, unki shradhanjali abhi bhi baki hai, (It was the court’s tribute to Nirbhaya, but the promises made by politicians and government are yet to be fulfilled, their tribute is still due)”, lamented Lalji. 
 
 A day before Nirbhaya’s terhwi (13th day rites) in January 2013, former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav visited Medaura Kalan to console the kin and offer government help. “He had promised a primary health centre (PHC), an inter college and jobs to four persons from our family,” recalled Lalji further adding that except the primary health facility, other promises remain unfulfilled. The PHC also remains locked most of the time for want of doctors. The girls here still have to trudge 10 km to the nearest high school, as the promised government inter-college remains a long distance dream.
