Chandigarh: The Punjab cabinet led by chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday approved the starting of pre-primary classes in state government schools from the next academic session. The enrollment of children over three years of age will start later this month.

 As per the existing rules, the government schools can only admit children over the age of six years. The decision has been taken keeping in mind the fact that Punjab has an estimated 5.33 lakh child population in the age group of 4-6 years. The concerned authorities observed that by not admitting children in the age group of 4-6 years, learning level of the students become stagnant and such children lag behind their counterparts studying in private schools.
 
 The chief minister also suggested that there was a need of improvement in the government school curriculum and there should be addition of more historical events and heroes to connect children to their roots. Local bodies and tourism minister Navjot Singh Sidhu suggested the inclusion of cultural topics in the curriculum.
 
 It also came to fore that despite Punjabâ€™s child population currently standing at 24.47 lakh in the age group of 6-10 years, enrollment in government schools is merely 9.6 lakh. It has been observed that the decline in enrollment has increased every year as parents tend to send their wards to private schools at an early age which is less than six years. However, as per RTE Act and government policy, children below the age of 6 years cannot be admitted in government schools.
