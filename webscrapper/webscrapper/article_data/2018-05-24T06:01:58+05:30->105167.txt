CHENNAI: The police have cracked the five-month-old murder of a man in Ponneri by arresting his ex-roommate who switched on the mobile phone of the   last week, unaware that the number was being tracked.

 The arrested man Suresh admitted to police during interrogation that he murdered his roommate Vijay during a drunken brawl and buried the body in the backyard of their house.
 
 Based on his confession, police exhumed the skeleton of the victim in the presence of tahsildar Sumathi and sent it to the Ponneri government hospital.
 
 The police said Vijay, 20, from Krishnapuram in Vellore, was employed at an iron smelting unit in Ponneri. He had rented a house in the same locality which he shared with Suresh. On December 15, Vijay went missing from his house, following which his mother lodged a complaint at the Ponneri police station.
 
 Soon after the police began their investigation, Suresh also went missing. Vijayâ€™s phone was also untraceable. The police could not make a breakthrough in the case and decided to track the phone through its IMEI number.
 
 The phone had been switched off until last week when the police finally struck pay dirt by finding that the phone was being used near Ennore.
 
 Subsequently, a special team tracked and nabbed Suresh who told police that he began using the phone thinking that the investigation had been dropped.
