PUNE: Minister of state   on Saturday announced that he would resign from his post if the state government doesn't resolve Pune's garbage crisis permanently. 

 The   leader represents   constituency, which covers Uruli Devachi and   villages. He also attacked guardian minister   for his 'apathetic' attitude towards the issue and for going on a foreign tour ignoring the crisis.
 
 "For the last 23 years, this problem has been unresolved. Now I am going to take up this issue. The chief minister has promised to look into the matter. We will have a monitoring committee, which will conduct monthly reviews. The committee will meet the chief minister every three months. Within the next 15 days, we will have a concrete plan to resolve this issue permanently. If this doesn't happen, I will join the agitation. I will resign from the cabinet if I fail to find a solution,"   told villagers. 
 
 He added that the opposition is politicizing the issue. 
 
 He also targeted Bapat and said the problem cannot be left unresolved just because the guardian minister is not here.
