Life has come a full circle for Dr   Vignesh. The singer-composer, best remembered for her role as Kamal Haasan’s daughter in  , recently launched a video of one of the songs from her album, Vishnumaya. Interestingly, the number —   — was shot by ace cinematographer MS  , who worked on Mahanadi!

 An excited Shobana, who launched the number on Gandhi Jayanti on Jaya TV, says, “Vishnumaya comprises songs in various languages — a Marathi abhang, a Tamil paattu, a Sanskrit sholka and Vaishnavo Janato in Gujarati among others. I’ve read that this song featured in Gandhiji’s daily prayer rituals. Since this has a soothing effect, my team and I decided to do a video cover for it. We shot at Gandhi Mandapam; with a memorial for Gandhiji and other beautiful sculptures, it was apt. I’ve grown up in Chennai and this was the first time that I actually got to admire the aesthetically constructed mandapam.”
 
 Interestingly, Shobana is facing the camera after almost 24 years. She says, “Incidentally, I met Prabhu uncle a few weeks ago. He was the one who first heard me sing when I was a child and recommended my name to Kamal sir. That’s how I sang   in the film. When I asked him if he could recommend a technician to shoot the song video, he said he would do it himself. It felt so good to work with him again after so many years; I remembered shooting Sri   in the temple amidst beautiful sculptures and this was such a déjà vu for me. There were more than 23 technicians involved in the making of the video and I’m happy it’s got good traction.”
