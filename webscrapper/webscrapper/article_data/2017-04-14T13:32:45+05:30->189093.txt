When it comes to fashion, glasses don’t usually make the cut. From the red carpet to events, it’s hard to spot someone flaunting their glasses.

 She’s spreading this eyewear movement, on and off duty! For one of the movie promotions, Sonakshi was spotted wearing a polka dot dress with super-sleek specs. She flaunted the nerdy-chic look with white sneakers and a sleek ponytail.
