MADURAI: A 21-year-old man was arrested on charges of raping a Plus Two student studying in a government higher secondary school. The minor girl, who was exploited for a long time by the accused, came forward to lodge the complaint, after it came to light that she was four months pregnant.

 The accused was identified as P   from   near  . Police said that he developed a love affair with the victim couple of years ago. For some months, he had been taking her to his house, when his parents were away at work, and sexually exploited her. Police said the girl had initially resisted, but he convinced her by promising to marry her. He then started sexually exploiting her regularly.
 
 Recently, the girl’s parents learnt about the affair. They also found out that she was pregnant. She was immediately taken to Melur all women police station, where a complaint was lodged on Sunday.
 
 Acting on the complaint, police picked up Ajith the same day. Police said that during investigation, he admitted to the crime. Consequently he was booked under Sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. He was produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in prison. 
 
 Police said that the accused would have been arrested anyway even if the sexual act took place with the girl’s permission, since she is a minor.
