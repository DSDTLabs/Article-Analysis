KOCHI: The district administration has banned parking of trucks on the   International Container Transhipment Terminal (ICTT) Road from January 26. 

 The authorities will arrange a   on three acres near the terminal, which was handed over by the   (CPT) to   Ltd (BPCL). 
 
 Though the CPT had handed over the land to BPCL last year, procedures for arranging parking facility got delayed as departments concerned failed to provide sanction.
 
 “We bought the land on lease for 30 years from the CPT. Currently, we are doing earth-filling works to harden the land. Around 200 containers can be parked on the land. We need to set up a petrol pump, resting room, toilet facilities for container crew, spare part shop, hotel and a doctor-on-call facility on the yard. It will take at least four months to establish all these facilities,” said a BPCL official.
 
 Though parking ban was imposed several times along the roadside in the area, it could not be implemented properly. 
 
 District collector K Mohammed Y Safirulla said, “Earlier there were no alternative for container crew to park vehicles and that’s why regulations could not be enforced. Now, drivers can park containers on the yard.”
 
 The parking of containers on the stretch is a headache for both the police and the public due to frequent accidents.
