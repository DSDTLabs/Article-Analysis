VADODARA: Around 600 guards posted at various facilities of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) including the   headquarters have not been paid salaries for the last two months. The guards have been provided by a private agency that was given the security contract by the civic body.

 The issue has sparked a major controversy as it has come to light that the security agency had not furnished bills since November 2017 when it was given the contract. It has also been alleged that for the first two months, the agency had paid an amount lesser than the minimum wages decided in the contract.
 
 The security guards made representations regarding the issue to VMC officials including the standing committee chairperson Dr Jigisha Sheth on Friday. She has asked the officials to ensure that the wages are paid and if this does not happen take action against the contractor.
 
 VMC encroachment and security director Dr   said that the contractor had not placed his bill since November. “We have given him a notice too regarding non-payment of wages,” said Jaiswal.
 
 Veteran Congress councillor   shot a letter to the VMC commissioner regarding the issue. Zaveri said that it seemed that the agency Radiant Security was not keen on working in the VMC. Zaveri alleged that the agency had been paying wages lower than what was promised to the agency. Security guards also said that they were given wages lower than what was decided.
 
 Jaiswal pointed out that while the wages paid before January were lower, the difference was paid to the guards subsequently. He added that the agency had assured that the wages of is personnel posted with the VMC will be paid soon.
 
 Zaveri demanded that as a principal employer, the VMC should pay the wages if the contractor did not do so. He also said that if the contractor was not keen on working with the VMC, his contract should be cancelled and the earnest money deposit should be seized.
