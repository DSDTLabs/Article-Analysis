COIMBATORE: Around 2,000 members of   organisations in the district organised a   against the   government for the murder of 17 cadre right wing party workers in the last eight months. 

 The signed petition will be submitted to President Pranab Mukherjee urging his intervention in the matter.
 
 Bharatiya Janata Party along with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( ), Akhil Bharatiya Vishwa Parishad ( ), Hindu Munnani Katchi and Seva Bharati participated in the protest at Gandhi Park between 10am and 12noon. 
 
 Speaking to TOI,   state general secretary Vanathi Srinivasan said, “This is a nation-wide protests by the Sangh Parivar to demand action against the Communist government in Kerala that is responsible for the murders of 17 cadre and party workers in the last eight months.”
 
 The protesters said the Communist government in Kerala was indifferent to all the pleas and request made by BJP and other Right wing organisations. “A woman party worker was killed in her village recently. We had asked to set up a peace committee to ensure that no killings happen, but our requests went unheard,” said Vanathi.
 
 After several attempts to reach out to the Pinarayi Vijayan government, the BJP and other Right wing organisation decided to organise a nation-wide protest to seek President’s intervention, she said.
