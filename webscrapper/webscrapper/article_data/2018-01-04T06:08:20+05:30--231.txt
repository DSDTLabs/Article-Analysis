KOLKATA: A sixty-two-year-old man died after falling from the second floor of his home in Poddar Colony near   in Behala on Wednesday morning.

 According to police, victim   was standing on a sunshade to carry out the repair work of a window.
 
 The sunshade caved in and Senapati fell on the ground. He was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, which informed the police. He succumbed to his injuries at the hospital. A case of unnatural death was registered.
 
 Investigators from the Parnasree police station said Senapati, a retired executive of a private firm, was trying to repair a damaged window on the second floor. He climbed on the window pane and stood on the sunshade to balance himself. Later, his wife heard a thud and rushed to the window to see him lying in a pool of blood on the ground.
 
 DC (Behala) Meeraz Khalid said, “Senapati wife   (52) and son   were questioned at length. We visited the incident spot and found nothing suggesting any foul play. Prima facie, the case appears to be an accident. But we aren’t ruling out other possibilities.
 
 We will wait for the post-mortem report to ascertain the exact cause of death.” The cops are investigating if Senapati was suffering from any chronic illness. “His family said the victim often did the repair work in the house by himself and thought it was worth the risk to climb on to the second floor of the building to fix the damaged window,” said an investigating officer.
 
 The cops are also interrogating some of Senapati’s relatives and neighbours.
