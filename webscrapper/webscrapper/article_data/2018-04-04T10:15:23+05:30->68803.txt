HYDERABAD: The elections are only a year away but the   government is miles away from fulfilling the promise of chief minister   to distribute three-acre land free to landless poor and   families.

 Less than 7,000 Dalit families of the total 3.3 lakh landless Schedule Castes households have been covered under the land distribution sop till now. “At this rate of 7,000 beneficiaries being covered in the last four years, it would take a few decades to cover the targeted six lakh beneficiaries,” a Dalit leader told TOI. He was referring to three lakh more Dalit families who own less than three acres of land and who will also be covered under the scheme.
 
 Under the scheme, the government was supposed to distribute three acres each to 3.3 lakh landless Dalit households and three lakh more to households, with less than three acres of land. A study carried out by the   revealed that the increasing cost of land is posing a major challenge to the officials in buying the land. Officials said the CM had said on the floor of the assembly that the government is committed to distributing land to every eligible Dalit family and that it would be a continuous exercise till every eligible Dalit family is covered.
 
 Complaints are also pouring in that the land is not uniform for those beneficiaries who have been handed out the sop. There have been instances where land not suitable for cultivation has been distributed and at other times, the land was found to be part of a lake. Officials, however, denied this saying that no land of FTL or maximum flood flow area has been distributed. Some beneficiaries alleged they they were provided land on hillocks.
 
 While officials are trying to put up a brave face stating they are ensuring that cultivable land is given to the Dalit families, the beneficiaries, in some cases, claimed that they were given land where there is no source of irrigation and the beneficiaries have to depend on rain.
