PANAJI: Goa Police’s investigations may soon get better, as the Goa state   bureau has commenced full-fledged operations. The bureau currently holds records of 39,504 arrested persons. 

 The now fully-staffed bureau will also enable Goans to get fingerprint certificates to obtain work visas from foreign embassies. 
 
 Crime branch SP Karthik   told TOI the bureau was established in   in 2002 and currently functions from Verna under the control of the director of forensic science laboratory, N P Waghmare. Kashyap lauded the bureau for showing ‘incredible performance’ in cracking sensational cases. 
 
 Available statistics show that the past few years have seen fingerprint matches in four murder cases. Likewise, the culprits in nine housebreaks have been arrested based on fingerprint matches. 
 
 Kashyap said that even in some tricky cases where investigation officers found no clues, fingerprint matches came to the rescue. 
 
 The bureau even helps in death. As many as 12 previously unidentified bodies had their identities established based on fingerprints.
