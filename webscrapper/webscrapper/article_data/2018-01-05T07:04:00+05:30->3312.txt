 “According to police estimates, there are around 60,000 cameras that have been installed by resident associations and private organisations in the city. We aim to use these cameras as part of the new system,” said V. Umashankar, the Gurgaon municipal corporation commissioner.
 
 Footage from the cameras will be monitored from the police commissioner’s office and can be accessed by all civic bodies. The new surveillance system is expected to not only help the police track down errant vehicles, but also act as a deterrent for anti-socials and criminals.
 
 The system is also likely to help in the better monitoring of development projects and the city’s traffic.
 
 A pilot project was launched at the police commissioner’s office on Thursday by Anand Mohan Sharan, the principal secretary, urban local bodies. 
 
 As part of the pilot project, 61 CCTV cameras have been installed in   at 15 points between Sector 4/7 Chowk and Sadar Bazaar. 
 
 “The project is a part of a bigger plan for safer cities and we are sure that Gurgaon will be the first city in the state to have such a system. The pilot project has been implemented and the entire plan will be a success,” said Sharan.
 
 The surveillance system will also have an “Emergency Communication Box”, which can be used by the residents to alert the control room about possible crime and emergency situations. Five ECBs have been installed under the pilot project. The system will send alerts if anyone tries to damage the cameras.
