GUWAHATI: Despite the city's aspirations to the   tag and the fast growth it has witnessed, citizens fail to find basic public transport in the evening.

 "It is very difficult to travel around the city after 9pm. There are no buses or other forms of public transportation. Not everyone can afford to use cab services or auto rickshaws all the time. It is especially difficult for senior citizens and women,"  , a retired school teacher, said.
 
 The Kamrup (Metro) district administration and the   (RTA) have tried to address the situation but the services they initiated never quite took off. In 2015, the district administration started a project, on an experimental basis, of providing evening bus services in the city on three routes. The buses plied till midnight. The city bus owners' association also extended support to the project. 
 
 "We did initiate and tried to continue transport services till midnight but public response was lukewarm," deputy commissioner M Angamuthu said. "Maybe it is time to revamp the plan and look for better alternatives. We will look into what other models we can take up with RTA soon," he added.
 
 For most citizens, availability of bus services till even 10pm would suffice. "There has always been a problem with transportation. We don't need public transport till 12am as of now. If we get buses till 10pm, we will be more than happy," said Rita Das, who works at a shopping mall in the city.
