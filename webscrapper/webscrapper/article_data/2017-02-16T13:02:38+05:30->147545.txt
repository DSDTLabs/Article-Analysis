BHOPAL: A Gwalior-based woman has got frantic after getting a call from her missing son who claimed he was being trained at Pakistan border. The youth –  , 28, had been missing for the last three months. 

 His mother   approached police on Wednesday claiming she received the call from Vishal who said he was undergoing training at the border and would return home soon. The call got disconnected after that.
 
 “The call came from an unknown number which was switched off after that. We tried calling on that number several times, but it’s off. I am worried now,” Sunita Kushwah told TOI. 
 
 She alleged police was not registering a missing person’s report and instead was asking her to visit one police station to the other. Vishal is a resident of Balaji Dham Colony, Gwalior. He had gone to meet his relatives three months ago and was not seen after that.
 
 His mother and wife have been trying to locate him since then. Police officials claimed Vishal had run away from his house following a family dispute. Local residents say that recent coverage of MPATS crackdown on the so-called   in the state is one reason that she got worried after the phone call.
 
 Vishal was in touch with one of the accused who has already been arrested by the ATS in connection with the simbox fraud. Earlier also when two suspects were detained by ATS, their family members had tried to lodge a missing person’s complaint at local police stations forcing top police officials to issue an advisory that no such complaint should be entertained without their prior approval.
