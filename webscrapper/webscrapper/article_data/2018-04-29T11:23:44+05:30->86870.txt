 CHANDIGARH: The summer sun burns a hole in the pocket of   again. For the past fortnight, its residents are forced to buy bottled water because the pressure of municipal supply is too low to fill their overhead tanks. The supply is gone before many of them even rise.
 
 The water supply was erratic even last summer. Since the rotational cut starts well before the 9am schedule for the sector, people must wake up early to be able to fill all their buckets by 7am. During day time, they use electric motor to lift water to the dry tanks on the first and second floors. Because of low water pressure, this chore of storage requires them to haul buckets to the top. For saving the toil, they started buying packed water.
 
 Sector-21 resident Jatinder Malhotra said: “For the past 15 days, the water shortage has become acute. The general public in the city doesn’t understand the value of water, so many residents continue to misuse and waste this resource, which is one of the causes of low water supply. Resident   said: “I have been using buckets to carry water to the second floor. For many days now, my water tanks are not filled to capacity.”
 
 Schoolteacher Hitender Singh said he had not washed his car for a week. “The pressure of water supply has dipped to half. After 7am, there’s not a drop in the taps.” Resident Giriraj Soni said the sector’s water supply situation had not improved yet. “I have to wake up early to store water in the tank, buckets, and other vessels, since the pressure starts falling after 6am.”
