MADURAI: Hundreds of people interested in pets thronged the ‘All Breeds Championship’, a   organised by the   in the city, on Sunday. 

 A diverse variety of dogs ranging from small Chihuahua, Pug,   to imposing Rottweilers, Great Danes, Belgium Shepherds, and Labradores were displayed at the event. Domestic breeds like Chippiparai, Kanni, Rajapalayam, Mudhol Hound and Kombai were also on display. In total, 209 dogs from across Tamil Nadu were on display, the organisers of the show said. Among them roughly 40 were Indian dogs.
 
 Companion dog varieties like Shih Tzu and Chihuahua dogs attracted the old and young visitors alike.   from Madurai, owner of a Shih Tzu dog named Choco, said she was excited about the dog’s maiden participation in the championship. “Although varieties like Shih Tzu require extra care, me and my children are very fond of looking after Choco,” she told TOI.
 
 Senthil Kumar, a PWD engineer and proud owner of two Mudhol Hounds, was participating in the event for the first time. “I took part in the competition solely to spread awareness about Indian breeds. Domestic breeds need very little attention. They are happy with home-cooked food. They are very loyal and majestic apart from being very alert. You can count on them to keep your house and farm safe,” he said.
 
 “However, indigenous breeds are a neglected lot. When we fight for jallikattu to save indigenous bulls, we neglect the Indian dogs as many people think that keeping a foreign dog makes you modern,” he rued. 
 
 Dogs from Commando Kennels, Hyderabad, showcased their talents in tackling ‘terrorists’, locating hiding thieves and attacking intruders as a team.
 
 Maribel Sy and Emiliano Aquino Valdes from the Philippines adjudged the best dog in each category.
