CHANDIGARH: Travelling in Chandigarh Transport Undertaking ( ) buses was set to cost more as the authorities were considering to increase fare and rates of passes. 

 The CTU has prepared a proposal of increasing the rates ranging from 10% to 20% in three different slabs for AC and non-AC buses. The last revision of fares was done in 2014 after a gap of more than 10 years.
 
 With authorities not revising fares regularly despite steep hike in diesel prices and maintenance cost of buses, the CTU is incurring heavy losses annually. On an average, the CTU incurs losses of Rs 50 crore every year.
 
 At present, the commuters for travelling in non-AC buses have to shell out Rs 5 for up to 3 km, Rs 10 for 3 km to 10 km and Rs 15 for over 15 km. For travelling in AC buses, Rs 10 is charged for up to 3 km and Rs 15 for 3km to 10km and Rs 20 for above 10 km.
 
  director transport Amit Talwar said they were finalizing the proposal and it would be put up before higher authorities for approval.
 
 Federation of Sector Federation of Sector Welfare Associations (Foswac) chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu said the CTU should first improve its service before increasing the fare. "The CTU has failed to bring down the waiting period for boarding a bus. Commuters have to wait from 20 minutes to over one-and-a-half hour," said Bittu.
 
 According to official figures, the CTU has a fleet of around 500 buses which are operating from four depots. Out of total, around 410 buses are plying on the inter-city bus service and remaining on long routes. The inter-city bus service connects Chandigarh with Mohali and  , ferrying around 2 lakh commuters on a daily basis. The CTU is in process of buying 200 new buses which will be pressed into long route bus service. Approval has been accorded for purchase of new buses.
