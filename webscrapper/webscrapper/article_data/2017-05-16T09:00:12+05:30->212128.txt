Gandhinagar: The Gujarat government has said that forming a Patidar Aayog, as demanded by the Hardik Patel-led Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) is impossible, however, the state government said it is planning to form a  , or a commission for non-reserved castes.

 Gujarat deputy chief minister, Nitin Patel, said, “Some of Patidar groups are trying to the mislead people and expect that the government won’t talk to other groups, which is not possible in a democracy. 
 
 “Their demand of a Patidar Aayog seems not possible, as many other non-reserved caste groups are also demanding a commission for them.”
 
  “The government is open to forming a commission for savarnas or non-reserved castes if there is a consensus.”
