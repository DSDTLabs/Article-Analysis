NEW DELHI: A conference on improving India-Pakistan ties degenerated into fisticuffs at the   here on Tuesday after after high commissioner Abdul Basit’s earlier comments to Pakistan’s   about   being a terrorist drew in angry protesters. Controversial remarks by   member   further inflamed passions.

 The discussion, organised by the Centre for Peace and Progress (CPP), saw the participation of, apart from  , Pakistan’s former foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, Congress MP  , lawyer  , Observer Research Foundation chief  , among others. 
 
 However, towards the end of the discussion, as questioners began raising their voices, Basit’s previous comments returned to haunt the proceedings. 
 
 Audience members, who alleged that the organisers were Pakistani apologists, objected vehemently to Basit’s presence for his statement to Sama TV.
 
 Basit had reportedly said, “First they indulge in terrorism on our land. And now that we have punished a terrorist, why (do) the protest?” It led to much pushing and shoving with two elderly women falling down and hurting themselves. 
 
 One of the protesting questioner said he was an activist, Lalit Ambardar, who said the “genocide of Kashmiri Pandits was being brushed under the carpet”.
 
 “We cannot have a dialogue with a country which kills our people. Pakistan is a terror state, and we should declare it so,” Ambardar said.
