 Ajay Devgn starrer 'Raid' is directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, who has earlier directed 'Aamir' and 'No One Killed Jessica'. The film also stars Ileana D’Cruz and Saurabh Shukla. The four-song album resorts to the current trend of picking up old melodies and recreating them. 
 
 Of the four, two numbers, 'Sanu Ek Pal Chain' and ' ' are from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s collection and have been recreated by   with additional lyrics by Manoj Muntashir. Both the numbers sung by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan tick all the right boxes in terms of melody, music and soulful rendition. One can find an instant connect when you hear these tracks, as the familiar tunes tug at your heartstrings. However, this dependence on older songs and a seeming dearth of newer melodies in the industry of late, is a little alarming.
 
 The next song, 'Black', sung by Sukhwinder Singh, is a track with an agenda and a breath of fresh air after the remixes. It expresses opinions, preaches and reprimands — a perfect background score that talks about the story. There’s some excellent singing by Singh and the talented composer Amrit Trivedi’s music gives a rock-song feel, while Indraneel’s upfront lyrics go along with it. The backup vocals by Rajiv Sundaresan, Suhas Sawant, Arun Kamath and Shashwat Singh are commendable.
 
 'Jhuk Na Paunga' is a beautiful inspiring track sung by Papon in his soulful voice. This one is not the conventional Hindi film song that climbs the charts instantly, it’s nevertheless an ear worm, and another example of Amit’s musical expertise.
