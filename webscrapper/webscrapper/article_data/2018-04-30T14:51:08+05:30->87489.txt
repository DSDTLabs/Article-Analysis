MUMBAI: The farm loan   scheme declared last year was aimed at making defaulting farmers eligible to borrow again from banks. Yet, fresh crop loans from banks fell 40% in 2017-18 compared to the previous year. While Rs 42,172 crore was disbursed as loans in 2016-17, it dropped to Rs 25,316 crore in 2017-18.

 
  
  
 
 Bankers blame the decline on the delayed implementation of the waiver scheme. Until the old   is written off, banks cannot extend fresh credit. “Recoveries of loans from farmers have been hit since many are expecting to be included in the loan waiver or waiting for the money to reach their accounts,” said a senior banking official.
 
 The reason fresh crop loans have acquired urgency is because the kharif sowing season begins in June.
