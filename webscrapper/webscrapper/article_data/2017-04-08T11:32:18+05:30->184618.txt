Actress   says she is desperate to have kids. 

 The 31-year-old actress, however, says after ending her marriage with ex-husband Stefano Catelli she needs to find a "really brilliant partner" to settle down and start a family.
 
  
  
 
 "I absolutely want to have children. But how do you do it all? I think the only way you can is if you have a really brilliant partner," Arterton said. 
 
 "I see a therapist, who said: 'You know, there are people out there that are like Mark Rylance.' "Yes, if only everyone was like  ," she adds. 
 
 The "Made In  " star, who called time on her five-year marriage with Catelli in 2010, does not know if she will re-marry because the marital ceremony did not feel "important" to her when she first tied the knot. 
 
 "I don't really know my feelings on marriage any more. It wasn't even really important to me when I did it. I was young (24), and just thought 'Yeah, let's do it.'"
