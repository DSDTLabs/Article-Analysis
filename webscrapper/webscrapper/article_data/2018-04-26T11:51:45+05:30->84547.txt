PANAJI: The   ( ) has challenged the government to come out openly on the proposal to reduce licence fees for casinos, which were recently hiked. 

 AAP convenor Elvis Gomes said, “AAP had already claimed that the recent fee hike, while granting further extensions to casinos which the government was now seeking to reduce, was part of the overall strategy that helped in capitalisation through buying of shares at a reduced price and then strategically leaking the news of the fee hike reduction that caused a 14% rise in a day in the price of shares.”
 
 “In the absence of the chief minister, people in the government are a bit scared to put their notings on file on fee reduction, and hence, as is always the case, the typical modus operandi to approach the courts is being adopted. The casino operators are approaching the court, where, on expected lines the respondent; government, will weaken it’s stand so that the casino operators win,” Gomes said.
