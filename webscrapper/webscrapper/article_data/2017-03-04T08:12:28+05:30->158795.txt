AHMEDABAD: In this curious case, a man and his wife filed   petitions, one after the other, before  , for custody of their two children.

 The HC granted custody of the children to the mother and restricted the father’s rights to visit them. Six months ago, a city-based businessman moved the HC to free his wife and two kids from the   of his in-laws in Junagadh. The wife brought her two kids to court and made it clear that she had left her matrimonial home in Ahmedabad due to the strained relationship with her husband and in-laws. She expressed reluctance to return to her husband and insisted that the kids – an eight year old girl and two year old boy would stay with her.
 
 When the woman expressed her reluctance to return, the HC refused to intervene. On the husband’s request to allow him to meet his kids, the high court requested lawyers of both the parties to work out visitation rights. The woman said she did not have any objection to it, but was against exclusive custody to the father. The court disposed of the petition in December 2016, observing that it was not deciding the issue of guardianship and the parties should sort it out internally or before the proper court.
 
 Two months later, the wife knocked on the HC’s doors, with a   seeking custody of the children from her husband and in-laws. She complained that the husband quietly took away the children when he was allowed to visit them. She demanded their custody back.
 
 The HC judges spoke to the children and noticed the “deep affection, warmth and bonding between the children and the mother”.
