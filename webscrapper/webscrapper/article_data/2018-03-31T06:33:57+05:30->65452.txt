POINGUINIM: An overhead tank on the   hill, which was built around a year ago to cater to the drinking   needs of the coastal population of   and adjoining areas, often overflows resulting in wastage of water.

 Water from the   dam near   town is first pumped to   treatment plant which is around 3km away. From there, it is piped to the Keri tank. However, in the absence of a mechanism to monitor or control the filling of the tank, water often overflows.
 
 Deputy sarpanch of   told TOI that sometimes there is nobody around to alert the operators at Mokhard that the tank is full. When contacted, assistant engineer of the public works department (PWD) Lester Dâ€™Souza said he would look into the matter.
