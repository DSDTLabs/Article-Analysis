NAVI MUMBAI: Twelve hours after recovering and identifying a man’s body dumped in a well, the   Taluka cops and the crime branch team cracked the case and arrested the 24-year-old wife of the deceased for   on Wednesday evening.

 Accused Trupti Madhvi was arrested for killing her husband   (29), who worked for an engineering firm in Taloja MIDC. She had colluded with her lover who is at large. 
 
 Senior inspector Maloji Shinde of Panvel taluka police station said, “After we recovered the body, we obtained missing persons complaints from the nearby police stations. One complaint was lodged in a Kalyan station on September 9 by Trupti, who also identified the body as that of her husband.”
 
  Her call data records and inquiry in the locality revealed that she was in a relationship with a 24-year-old building painter who was her school friend, added Shinde.
 
 “After being detained, she confessed to have killed her husband with the help of her paramour,” he added.
 
 The duo had planned to kill the victim on September 8 night. Trupti’s lover entered the home of the couple in Ambernath and hit the victim with an iron rod and strangulated him. They carried the body on a scooter and dumped it in a well along Wavanje-Kalyan road. The accused had told the police that her husband left home after a quarrel on September 8. She also misled the cops by swiping her husband’s debit card at various places.
 
  But the CCTV footage at the ATM kiosk captured the images of her lover which nailed them.
