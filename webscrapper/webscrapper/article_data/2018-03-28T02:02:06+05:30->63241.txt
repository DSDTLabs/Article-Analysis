GURUGRAM:   members from   have moved court, accusing a municipal councillor of vandalism at a library inside the local community centre earlier this month.

 The RAW members claimed they were forced to take the legal recourse after police failed to initiate any action against ward No. 6 councillor  , who has allegedly been trying to turn the library into his office despite opposition from the residents.
 
 The residents alleged that Singh, along with his associates, had ransacked the library at the community centre on March 8 in an attempt to make room for his office.
 
 Singh, however, refuted the charge and said the library had been allotted to him by the municipal corporation for setting up his office.
 
 “We have filed a case in the civil court as police have failed to lodge an FIR against the councillor,” said HS Nanda, RWA president, Sector 14. The hearing, which was initially likely to start on Monday, has been scheduled for April 9.
 
 Councillor Singh said, “MCG had given the community centre to RWA only for maintenance purpose. They are not the custodians (of the centre). I am working as a councillor since 2005 but I had no office till 2017. MCG has legitimately given that space as office to me.” TNN
