PATNA: In a damage-control exercise, the   on Wednesday ensured crediting of Rs 5 lakh into the bank account of   martyr Ranjeet Kumar’s wife after TV channels flashed news earlier in the day that its compensation cheque to the family had bounced.
 
  Ranjeet and 24 CRPF personnel were martyred in Sukma (Chattishgarh) on April 25 this year. Six of the were from Bihar, and the state government had announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to their families.
  
  Ranjeet was a native of Chor Dargah village in   district. His cousin   told TOI over the phone the cheque issued in the favour of Sunita Devi was given to her by the Shiekhpura district administration on April 26.
  
  “We deposited the cheque of a private bank to a nationalised bank’s customer service centre at Aliganj. On May 6, we went to the bank and got Sunita’s passbook updated. The cheque was shown to have bounced,” Uday said, adding the customer service centre officials could not explain why the cheque bounced.
  
  Before approaching the Sheikhpura district administration, Uday on Wednesday morning visited the Aliganj (Sheikhpura) branch of the nationalised bank, where he came across a few newsmen. “I shared the details with some newsmen,” Uday said.
  
  Even as the news flashed on the TV, Uday visited the Sheikhpura main branch of the nationalised bank in the afternoon, where he was told the money had been credited into Sunita’s account.
  
  Attempts to contact Sheikhpura DM   to know what went wrong, went futile as he did not take the calls.
  
  The martyr is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter.
