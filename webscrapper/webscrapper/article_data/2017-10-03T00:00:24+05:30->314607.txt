MUMBAI: The   has organised a   for residents of South and Central Mumbai from October 3 to November 3. The suburban collector will announce a similar programme shortly.

 Election offices in Dharavi, Koliwada, Mahim, Wadala, Worli, Sewri, Byculla, Malabar Hill, Mumbadevi and Colaba are accepting registrations during office hours on all working days from 9.45am-5.30pm. Applicants can approach them with birth certificates, PAN cards, school leaving certificates, voters I-cards, address proof, bank passbooks or utility bills.
 
 A senior officer at the   headquarters at Flora Fountain said, “Some post-offices in and around Mumbai have installed facilities for people to make minor corrections or update addresses and cellphone numbers in their Aadhaar cards. Various banks are also setting up helpdesks where citizens can register for new Aadhaar cards or update existing ones.”
 
 Andheri resident Anshu Gill, who opened a bank account for her four-year-old son last month, was urged to register her child for Aadhaar as his account would be linked to that document. “I wish a similar drive is undertaken in the western suburbs soon,” she said.
 
 The income tax department has mandated assessees to link their PAN card with Aadhaar by December 31. Cellphone companies are issuing alerts to customers to link their phone numbers “lest their connection is severed”.
