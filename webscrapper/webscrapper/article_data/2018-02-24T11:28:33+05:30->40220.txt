BENGALURU:  , a   worker who was brought to   after a part of his arm was chopped off in   taluk of Chikkaballapura district, is in the ICU. 

  Ravikumar (in pic) reached the hospital in an ambulance at 9.55pm on Thursday, and his severed arm and hand were brought in a separate vehicle 15 minutes later. "Apparently, it took some time to get ice in which the limb was kept, so there was a delay. The limb was placed directly in the ice, and not wrapped in a plastic bag first," said Dr Ajith Benedict Rayan, medical director of the hospital.
 
 Frustrated over not getting a girl of his choice, a person identified as Lokesh Kumar had chopped off the front part of the victim's hand in Arkunda village of Gauribidanur taluk on Thursday.
 
 "We were able to save his left forearm as he was brought within three hours of the injury," said Dr  , chief of orthopaedics. Doctors said the reconstructive surgery took almost 8 hours.
