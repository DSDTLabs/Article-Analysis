NEW DELHI: The Delhi   lashed out at municipal corporations for their failure to act despite giving   to carry out orders.

 Earlier this week, Justice Manmohan directed the three commissioners of the municipal corporations to hold a meeting and lay down a monitoring mechanism by virtue of which undertakings given by their officers and by their lawyers in court are complied with within the time frame prescribed by the court.
 
 HC made it clear that it expects demolition orders to be executed and said the commissioners must file minutes of meeting that should be held within two weeks and posted the case for next hearing on April 25.
 
 “It is strange that consensual demolition orders are given effect to only at the pain of contempt. It seems to this court that there is no mechanism in any of the municipal corporations to monitor the implementation of undertakings/orders with regard to demolition of unauthorised and illegal construction. Needless to say, this does not reflect well on the administrators of the local corporations,” Justice Manmohan observed.
 
 He was hearing a contempt case where earlier the north corporation had assured the court it will demolish unauthorised construction in a property but then sat on the file. When the petitioner in the case again moved court seeking revival of contempt proceedings, the counsel told court that demolition action has been planned for today – that is the day of the hearing itself.
 
 But HC refused to buy the corporation’s claim and noted that “in the opinion of this court, once an undertaking or demolition order has been passed by a competent court and the same has been accepted as final, there should be no occasion for any party to file a contempt petition.”
