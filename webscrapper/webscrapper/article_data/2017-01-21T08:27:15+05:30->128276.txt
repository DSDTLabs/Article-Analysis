NEW DELHI: Ousted   bosses are not willing to lie low. One of them now wants to attend the International Cricket Council's (ICC) meeting from February 4 in Dubai. During the hearing in the   on Friday,  , representing the state cricket associations, told the apex court that the board needs a proper participation at the ICC and “known faces” should present Indian board's case in Dubai.

 “Sending someone new without the experience of having attended any ICC meeting will not be in the interest of Indian cricket. If you don't send someone from the board who knows how it works at ICC, it would be detrimental to India's cause,” Sibal told TOI hours after the SC hearing on the BCCI matter. Sibal also projected that BCCI would lose a huge amount of revenue if BCCI isn't represented appropriately, that when India contributes more than 70 per cent of revenues earned by ICC. He said that ousted BCCI bosses still want India to pursue its demand for 22 per cent share of revenue at the ICC meeting. To this, the apex court insisted on the appointment of the administrators first before looking into any other administrative suggestions.
 
 Contrarily, it was around last year when the BCCI's working committee had empowered then president   to re-negotiate BCCI's share from ICC's revenue. When Manohar resigned from BCCI and was made ICC chairman, he advocated the principle of dismantling the Big Three -India, Australia and England -which would have controlled world cricket. By doing that he could undo the top-heavy revenue distribution system introduced by his predecessor  , as the previous chairman of the ICC.
 
 When TOI contacted ICC officials, none of them were available for comment.
