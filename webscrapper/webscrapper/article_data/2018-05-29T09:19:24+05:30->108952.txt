PARIS:   was nudged by his coach to check the lucky loser sign-in sheet on Sunday. One out of the   main draw! 

 He was in the middle of a lazy afternoon at home in Barcelona and his 89-year-old grandmother Daphne was in the shower, preparing to hit the beach. He banged at the door to let her know. 
 
 “We go to Paris,” he shouted. In an hour the Trungellitis – brother Andre, mother Suzanna and Daphne – piled into the 28-year-old’s car. The world No.190 was going to give the 2018 French Open another shot.
 
 “Many flights get cancelled, so I didn’t trust that, there is no train now in France so the best option was the car,” he told a fullhouse of international media, giving details of the over 1000 km drive which the brothers completed between them in 11 hours. “It was good, coffee after every two hours. I had a dinner at 9:00. I slept for five hours maximum after we reached.”
 
 The Barcelona-based Argentine, who has now made the main draw of the French Open for the third successive year, drove for four hours before his brother took the steering wheel. “For us in Argentina, if you’re not living in Buenos Aires, 1000 kilometers is like nothing. 
 
 Also we had highway here, so it’s perfect.” Trungelliti walked onto court No.9 on Monday dressed in Parisian colours of black and white. His opponent Aussie wild child   joined him a full five minutes later. 
 
 The 28-year-old, who busied himself with fixing the shade and getting a feel of his racket, was unperturbed. He then made good the epic drive, scoring a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 win in 2 hours and 54 minutes. Trungelliti earned a total of Euros 79,000 for his Paris effort.
