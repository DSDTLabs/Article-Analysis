Nine of the 34 spotted deer rescued from the   institutional area in April and rehabilitated at the Children’s Park in   have died over the last one month, say wildlife officials.

 
 The crude methods adopted to trap the deer during the rescue operations had come in for criticism, with some activists saying this could put the deer under severe stress. However, it is not clear if this played a role in the deaths.
 
 The deer were moving freely before being rehabilitated and may have consumed   and other waste which could have led to the deaths, said a wildlife official.
 
 If the method adopted to trap them had triggered stress in the deer, they would have died soon after the capture, said Shravan Krishnan, an animal welfare activist who helped forest officials in the rescue operations.
 
 This suggested the deaths were not due to stress, he added.
 
 Officials are required to conduct a postmortem to find out the cause of death of any animal that dies in captivity. While an official at the Children’s Park could not confirm if autopsies had been carried out, he said a report had been prepared which stated that nine deer died after being shifted to the park.
 
 A total of 41 deer were found roaming inside a   in Taramani which had been leased to a private builder. When the builder took over the premises, he had all the vegetation cleared from the area which left the deer with no means of sustenance.
 
 On seeing the emaciated state of the deer, members of the public began to feed them. After this was reported in the media, wildlife officials began a rescue and rehabilitation operation on April 4.
 
 Over the next eight days, the deer were trapped apart from six which managed to escape and one female deer that strayed onto the Taramani-Velachery road and died after being hit by a speeding vehicle.
