BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister   on Wednesday visited trouble-torn   and met victims of last week's communal violence.   also promised financial assistance for those traders whose shops were set ablaze. However, the details would be announced after the district collector files his report. 

 "Full compensation will be given to the affected people. The district administration will assess the damage and submit the report within three days. I will announce the relief package soon," Naveen said after reviewing the situation.
 
 Naveen interacted with some of the victims at Apartibindha, Chandan Bazar and Puruna Bazar areas for nearly fifteen minutes after reaching Bhadrak in a helicopter around 1.40 am. Naveen's tour to the strife-torn district headquarters town came in the backdrop of speculations that the riot was engineered by some BJD leaders. 
 
 "It is better late than never. An inquiry commission should be set up to probe the communal riot," tweeted senior Congress leader and former Nabarangapur MP, Pradeep Majhi, in response to Naveen's visit to Bhadrak. 
 
 During the brief interaction with Naveen, the locals blamed the district administration and the police for escalation of the violence on April 7. In the evening Naveen removed the local SP Dilip Das and additional district magistrate Prabhat Bhoi. Das has been sent to police headquarters in   and Jajpur SP Anup Sahoo was asked to take charge immediately. Bhoi had been stripped off his charges on April 9. 
 
 "We have started a probe to find out how the police allowed a bike rally to pass in the area, where prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC had been clamped on April 7. Violence erupted after people in the bike rally clashed with another group," a police officer said. After Naveen left Bhadrak, Congress state president Prasad Harichandan and senior Congress leader   met the affected people. 
 
 Meanwhile, the curfew, which has been in force since April 7, was extended till Thursday morning.
