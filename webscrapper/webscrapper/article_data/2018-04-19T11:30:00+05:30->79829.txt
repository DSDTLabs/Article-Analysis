 Shakti and Neha chose to keep their wedding a private affair, away from the media glare. They got engaged on June 5, 2014 and it was followed by a courtship period of two years. 
 
 Neha and Shakti's love story hasn't been a smooth one. It was believed that the two had parted ways when their marriage, which was supposed to take place in November 2016, was indefinitely postponed.
 
 
  
 However, their love stood the test of time and the two are finally married. 
 
 Talking about his wedding functions to BT, Shakti had said, "We had the haldi ceremony in the morning and pheras in the evening. It was a private affair with only our immediate families in attendance. Both of us have been relatively free over the past few months and so, decided to take the plunge. It seemed like the perfect time, as I am planning to take up something soon and will become busy."
