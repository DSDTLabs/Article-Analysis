HYDERABAD: The   started on Monday, at   in Nampally with as many as 2,600 stalls that were allocated to the   (AIIE) Society. Only about 1,000 stalls remained open on the opening day.

 Delay in the arrival of goods from other states, bank holidays, and delay in the allotment of space by the Numaish organisers to the short-listed shops and other business establishments are the main reasons,   vice president, P Narotham Reddy told TOI. “In a day or two, we will ensure that all the 2,600 stalls are kept open,” Reddy added.
 
 But denizens who flocked to the venue were dejected and went back home without buying anything.
 
 “We roamed around the entire exhibition ground and planned to purchase kitchenware and some electronic goods in view of New Year. But we were upset as the stalls were not put up,” said Mohd Arif, a resident of Afzalgunz .
 
 “Inordinate delay occurred in allotment of space for us. Since two decades, we are displaying latest furniture and also largest furniture showroom in entire Numaish. To open this showroom, it takes at least a couple days,” said Syed Salim, owner of a furniture shop.
 
 The finance minister and the president of AIIE Society, Etala Rajender said, “Chief minister   is keen to upgrade the Numaish to the international level with products of latest technology.”
 
 Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari gave assurance to the AIIE Society that the government would take over the 18 educational institutions being run by the AIIE Society. Srihari was responding to a plea made by the finance minister as these institutions were facing staff and financial crunch.
 
 AIIE Society secretary, NVN Charyulu said the exhibition ground will be kept clean under ‘Swacch Exhibition’ concept. The Numaish will remain open till February 15.
