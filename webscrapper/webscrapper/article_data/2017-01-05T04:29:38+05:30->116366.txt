GURUGRAM: Residents of Sushant Lok 2 and 3 met the senior town planner ( ) on Wednesday and complained of lack of maintenance of the area as well as a power shortage. They also handed over a memorandum to the official, listing their grievances.

 According to residents, the developer has not yet provided the electricity department with four acres of land that is needed to construct a 66kV substation in the 601-acre township, which will solve their power woes.
 
 The residents also alleged that the area is ill-maintained and mismanaged by the maintenance firm appointed by the developer. “Ever since it has been announced that the area will be handed over to the MCG, there has been no proper maintenance. Each department passes the buck to another department. So we decided to raise the matter with senior town planner  ,” said Joginder Singh, president of Sushant Lok II and III RWA.
 
 Residents are also angry at the mushrooming illegal shanties in the area. People who stay in these shanties are mostly migrant labourers and they are eating into the water and electricity share of the residents, the memorandum states. When contacted, Ansari said, “I have asked the departments concerned to submit a report on the issues and redress the grievances.”
