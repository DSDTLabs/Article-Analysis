MANGALURU: Government chief whip in legislative council   said that BJP has commercialized the democracy in Goa. 

 Questioning the logic of  's decision to invite BJP to form the government, Ivan, said the Congress should have been given the opportunity first to prove majority as it has emerged as the single largest party in the  . 
 
 "With 17 seats out of 40, Congress is the single largest party in Goa assembly. However, the governor has invited the BJP to prove the majority. BJP national president Amit Shah soon after the election results were announced had declared that the party will form governments in Manipur and Goa. They have made democracy a commodity. It is a big blow to the democracy," Ivan said.
 
 Ruling out that a Modi wave has gripped the nation, Ivan said, "If that was the case then why BJP didnâ€™t get majority in Punjab, Manipur and Goa. He said that there is no Modi wave in Karnataka. "Congress is strong in Karnataka. There is no scope for anti-incumbency in Karnataka as chief minister   has fulfilled all the promises he had made before 2013 elections,' he added.
