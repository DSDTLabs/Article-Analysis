LUCKNOW: A UP-based social media adviser of Vishwa Hindu Parishad kicked up a big row when he announced on micro blogging site Twitter that he would not travel with a Muslim driver associated with location-based taxi app  .

 However, as massive outrage on the social media grew over him with demand to suspend his account with both Twitter and cab service, Ola hit back, saying their service is strictly a secular platform and the company would not support any views aiding disharmony.
 
  
  
 
 
 “Cancelling @olacabs booking because driver was Muslim. I dont want to give my money to jihadis (sic)” wrote Abhishek Mishra, who has a verified Twitter account while tagging Ola.
