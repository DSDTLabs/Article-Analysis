Mapusa: Shareholders of the Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank of Goa Ltd put the establishment’s board of directors on the mat over a host of issues at an annual general meeting held on Friday.  Holding the board responsible for the bank’s poor financial health over the past two years, the shareholders also grilled the directors for not taking them into confidence over the alleged attempt to convert the bank into a credit society. Claims of a merger further angered the shareholders, who persistently demanded that the board step down. They said the management hadn’t been able to handle the financial crisis within the bank’s 24 branches and that loans, which were given selectively, weren’t recovered.  The bank’s former chairman and director Ramakant Khalap, in reply, said the first priority was to get relaxation from the RBI to restart lending.  He also assured shareholders that no decision concerning a merger or conversion would be taken without taking them into confidence.
