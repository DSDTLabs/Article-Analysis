GAYA: The third and final phase of admission of children from the economically weaker sections to private schools under the Right to Education Act 2010 will commence on April 20. According to a press release issued by the district public relations officer KN Gupta, about 700 poor children will be selected for the admission. The selection is being done through lottery. 

 The Act stipulates reservation of 25% of the seats in high fee private schools for children belonging to economically disadvantaged groups. Children whose parents have an annual income of Rs 2 lakh or less per annum, are eligible for admission to Class I. According to district programme officer Asghar Khan, the government will reimburse the tuition fee for these children at the rate of Rs 6,569 per child per annum. The reimbursement is made directly to the school concerned. 
 
 “Fifty per cent of RTE seats are reserved for girls,” said Khan.
 
 Lottery for the first phase of admission under the Act was drawn on March 31, 2018. In the first phase, 911 children were selected for admission to 85 schools registered under the Act. The second phase lottery was drawn on April 10 in which 1125 out of 2500 applicants were selected for admission to 158 schools. Selected kids will be given one week time for admission, said Khan.
 
 District magistrate Abhishekh Singh has given strict directive for effective implementation of the Right to Education Act. While schools doing good work will be honoured, those manipulating records to show less number of seats under the Act would be punished.
