As galahad Taron Egerton, the protagonist of  : The Golden Circle, and his uncle, ex-galahad played by Colin Firth, deflect bullets with an umbrella or click their heels to reveal a knife secreted in the toe of their oxford shoes, one thing becomes quite clear – in their case, clothes maketh a man.

  And if we go beyond their accents, then everything, right from their clothes to pistols, umbrellas, manners and well, even spying screams "British!" But it's not something recent – the British's obsession with a spy fighting in well-tailored blazers and pants has been evident right from the '60s show Avengers to the latest   flick and now, even the Kingsman franchise. So the question here is – from Savile Row suits to old school ties, and a lethal way with a weaponised umbrella – why must British screen spies be so posh anyway?
 
  The heritage of the English gentleman spy extends way back to the Bond and   series, and films like The Ipcress File (1965) , among others. And if you pay attention, you'll see that in fiction, film and TV, the British secret services have been the historic preserve of posh. The story was inspired by director Matthew Vaughn's own experiences of buying a bespoke suit from a tailor on Savile Row, London, during which he daydreamed about pulling on a hook on one of the walls and it opening a secret door! So are you ready to watch sharply dressed fighting the villains in their well-tailored suits on September 22?
