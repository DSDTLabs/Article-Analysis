 Accelerated Anaerobic Composting ( ) is a method used for preparing manure from water hyacinth. As per this procedure, after removing the water hyacinth, it is dumped on the shore with a earth mover and the roots separated with stems and leaves chopped into small pieces. The pieces are then filled in composite pits. The pits are supposed to have 90% water hyacinth material, 8% dung and 2 % bioculam liquid (bacteria) for the composting procedure.
 
 The paste-like material composted from pits is removed and dried on tarpaulins to turn into the organic soil conditioner (manure). The dried compost is then filled in bins packed and sent to a godown. At the godown, the material is pulverized into powder.
 
 The organic soil conditioner has been approved, said Raju L Kanchibhotla. “It met all the conditions laid by fertilizer authority of India, and we are planning to dispatch it in markets by June,” added  .
