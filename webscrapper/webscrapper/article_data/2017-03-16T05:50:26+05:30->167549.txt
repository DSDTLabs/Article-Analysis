GURUGRAM: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday instructed the   government and the state pollution control board ( ) to submit a report on Gurgaon’s ambient  . 

 The tribunal gave the order after residents of sectors 65 and 67 filed a petition in the green court to look into increasing dust and air pollution levels in the city. 
 
 “The state of Haryana and HSPCB should submit they would examine the grievance raised by the applicant... and prepare a complete and comprehensive report in relation to ambient air quality in the town of Gurgaon and even Sohna. They would obviously examine the causes of pollution as well as take remedial measures immediately thereafter,” states the NGT order (a copy is with TOI).
 
 “It is an excellent direction by NGT, asking the state and its pollution control board to provide a comprehensive report on causes of pollution and remedial steps they have taken,” said the petitioner’s lawyer, Jai Dehadrai. 
 
 One of the applicants, Kush Kochgaway, said, “After exhausting all options of working collaboratively with MCG, Huda, HSPCB and DTCP for months, I was forced to knock NGT’s doors. Administrators need to understand we all are suffering as air pollution in the city increases by the day. Unfortunately, there have been no urgent steps taken by the authorities in this regard.”
 
 “The case was disposed off in the first hearing. We haven’t got the writ yet. We will definitely follow the directions and file the report as soon as we receive it. Major causes of air pollution in the city are traffic congestion, diesel autos and rampant construction activities. We are, however, making sure that construction norms are followed strictly. We are also taking other measures to bring down the level of air pollution,” said Bhupinder Singh, regional officer, HSPCB.
 
 The order also states once the report is submitted, it will be registered and put up before the green court for appropriate direction.
