PATNA: The district administration has started cleaning the major Ganga ghats in the city for   to be celebrated from March 21 to 24. Patna district magistrate (DM)   said the district administration is working hard to make the ghats clean and safe for the devotees. "There are 29 major ghats where cleanliness drive has been launched. The departments concerned have been asked to ensure basic facilities at the ghats for the Chaiti Chhath," he said. 

  The administration has started barricading the ghats and constructing bridges to avoid overcrowding. "We have marked safe places on the ghats for offering prayers to the sun god. Divers, motor boats, life jackets,   (NDRF) and   (SDRF) teams have been deputed in adequate strength," he said. 
 
 No private boat would be allowed in the Ganga till the festival ends. "There will be one-way traffic arrangement to reach and leave the ghats to avoid congestions. The most important task is to barricade the dangerous ghats and stop people from reaching those areas," the DM said. The public health and engineering department (PHED) would look after the drinking water, handpumps, toilets and urinal facilities. The Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation and   have been asked to repair the roads and staircases at the ghats and ensure proper lighting facilities. Control rooms and CCTV cameras would be set up at all the ghats in addition to making arrangements for ambulances and medical facilities. The traffic personnel would manage the parking areas near the ghats, the DM said.
