Mumbai: The victory of Shiv Sena’s two Muslim candidates—Shahida   from ward 64 (Amboli-Jogeshwari) and Haji Haleem from ward 96 (Behrampada)—shows the community’s growing acceptance of the saffron party.

 Haji Haleem is a social worker in the predominantly  , a sprawling slum in Bandra (E), one of the areas worst affected in the 1993 riots. Haleem, who joined the Sena just before the polls, said SP and MIM too had offered him tickets. But he believed that the Uddhav Thackeray-led party alone would allow him to develop Behrampada. “Sena has never got more than 200 votes here, but I got 4,050 and won by 350 votes. Muslims have reposed faith in a Sena candidate,” he said.
 
 Shahida Haroon Khan is a housewife and her husband Haroon Khan joined Sena 25 years ago and has been a shakha pramukh for 15 years in Amboli. “Muslim population is just 35% in this ward and every party, except MIM and Sena, fielded Hindu candidates. They thought a Muslim would have slim chances. Since I am a grass-root worker and this became a ward reserved for ladies (open), my supporters suggested I field my wife from here,” said Khan.
 
 Two prominent Muslims in Shiv Sena—Haji Arafat and Sajid Soopariwala—had demanded 11 seats for Muslims but got five. “Apart from two Muslims, we also won two seats in the Muslim-dominated Govandi where Sena had not won a seat in the last 25 years,” said Arafat.
