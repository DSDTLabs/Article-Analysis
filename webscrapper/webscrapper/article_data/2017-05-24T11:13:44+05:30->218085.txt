NAGPUR: Citizen’s Forum for Equality has decided to file a contempt petition against Maharashtra Rashtrabhasha Sabha (MRS) and   ( ), since the former has failed to pay Rs 40 crore as the first ground rent instalment, and the latter has failed to take coercive action in the matter.

 In a press conference at Tilak Patrakar Bhavan on Tuesday, forum’s president Madhukar Kukde said he will move the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court after its summer vacation ends.
 
 The high court had ordered NIT to revise rate of ground rent after Kukde contended that the rent calculated by the trust was too low.
 
 The total amount payable by MRS thus came to Rs 163.75 crore, of which an initial instalment of Rs 40.33 crore was to be paid to NIT immediately. The matter had also come before the Supreme Court, which upheld the high court’s judgement and ordered the same.
 
 The land in question is a one-acre plot on North Ambazari Road, initially leased to MRS in 1961 by NIT for 30 years.
 
 Wockhardt Hospital was built on this land after the lease was renewed in 1991. Kukde also informed of a case filed at sessions court, Nagpur, by social worker Shantaram Patil alleging illegal transactions with respect to this land.
 
 On April 27, Nagpur   issued notice to MRS to immediately pay the first instalment. Kukde said, “Both parties are at fault. NIT has been lenient in this matter and has not taken any steps to ensure MRS pays the rent.”
