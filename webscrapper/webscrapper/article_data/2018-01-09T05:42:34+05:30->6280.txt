NEW DELHI: The government’s think-tank, Niti Aayog, will frame the policy for electric vehicles while all concerned ministries will implement them, the   secretary chaired meeting decided on Monday, ending the turf war among different entities.

 Sources said the programme will be headed by a mission director and Niti Aayog will act as coordinator.
 
 Cabinet secretary convened the meeting after reservations were lodged by different ministries, including transport ministry stating that Niti Aayog cannot be the implementing agency for this ambitious programme. “There has to be a coordinated effort among all the ministries and departments concerned rather than trying to prove oneupmanship by any organisation. Each ministry has to do its bit,” said a source, who attended the meeting.
 
 Niti Aayog, meanwhile, has drafted a policy for electric vehicles and has suggested that   could have green number plates. It also suggests that EVs may given benefits such as free parking for three years and toll charges could be waived off.
