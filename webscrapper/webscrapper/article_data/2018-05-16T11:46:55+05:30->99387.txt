LUDHIANA: With parts of the always-busy Jagraon Bridge and   Flyover closed to vehicles, traffic police here announced more diversions on Tuesday to handle vehicles which would have otherwise used the two routes.

 During a meeting called by deputy commissioner  , it was decided that a major traffic diversion would be made at Jagraon bridge. Additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sukhpal Singh Brar said traffic going from Vishkarma Chowk to Ferozepur Road, via Jagraon Bridge, had been diverted. “The left turn at Jagraon Bridge traffic lights, which is used for taking the Ferozepur Road, has been closed. Instead, traffic will now go straight towards the railway station. Once traffic crosses the railway station, it will take the Lakkhar Bridge route to reach Ferozepur Road by crossing Fountain Chowk and Bharat Nagar Chowk,” added Brar.
 
 While the section of Gill Chowk Flyover which connects Link Road to Cheema Chowk and Samrala Chowk has been closed to traffic, Jagraon Bridge’s GT Road-Ferozepur Road stretch is non-operational. The official said traffic from Dholewal had also been diverted to Pahwa Hospital Road, as vehicles would not be allowed to reach Gill Chowk. Also, traffic from Sahnewal has been diverted to Southern Bypass and from Arora Theater Chowk to Grain Market, Gill Road.
 
 The diversions mean that commuters would have to face longer traffic snarls while commuting through these areas. Railway Station Road, Fountain Chowk and Bharat Nagar Chowk are already jam-packed with traffic and the new diversions will add to the chaos.
 
 After the flyover’s wall had collapsed, traffic police had already announced diversions on Monday too. In those diversions, vehicles coming from Focal Point, Dhandari and Kanganwal and going towards Sarabha Nagar and   had been diverted to Southern Bypass.
