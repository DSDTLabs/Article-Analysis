VADODARA: A fresh controversy has erupted at M S University over the Startup summit which the   and Governance (ILG) will be organizing in the month of July. 

 
 ILG has started promoting the forthcoming Startup summit which it will be organizing in association with Startup Vadodara between July 1 and July 10. 
 
 But the way in which the forthcoming summit is being promoted has irked office-bearers of university’s own –   Startup and Entrepreneurship Cell ( ). 
 
 “The promotional posters of the   2018 neither carry the official logo of MSU nor the logo of MSEC, which is the official cell that has been entrusted the job of promoting startup and entrepreneurship culture among students,” said Dr  , coordinator of MSEC. 
 
 On the other hand, Kahar had twice approached MSU authorities seeking their permission to organize programmes like MSU Startup Summit, ‘Ideathon’ and ‘Protothon’ but has not received any response till date. 
 
 “The university authorities have not responded to my request letters written in December and January to implement the Startup Innovation Policy (SSIP) agenda of Gujarat government for which the grants have already been sanctioned. But now all of a sudden ILG has announced the summit bypassing the cell which has been legally constituted through a resolution passed by university’s own syndicate body,” he said. 
 
 Kahar has demanded that the university authorities should take strong action against those persons who are not employees of the university but are using the award that MSU has received from the state government to promote themselves on social media. 
 
 The allegations that MSU authorities are acting with prejudice aren’t new at the campus. 
 
 Kahar had contested in the syndicate elections as a candidate backed by the ‘sankalan samiti’ against the rival ruling saffron group which presently enjoys majority in the syndicate body.
