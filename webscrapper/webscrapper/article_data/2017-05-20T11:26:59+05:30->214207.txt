PUNE:   limits, building a continuous divider to prevent jaywalking, more and better signage along   are among the 10 -point agenda being drawn up by the   to make the   for users.

 The foundation has joined hands with residents of the area to reduce the hazards on the road exposed after the fatal accident on April 17, when a speeding car mowed down two pedestrians waiting on the median to cross the road. The initiative was announced on May 7 at the Happy Streets event of The Times of India by Prashant Chaudhari, a senior radiologist. 
 
 As a part of the initial effort, top representatives of the foundation reviewed the prevailing conditions by doing a recce of the road during morning and evening peak hours to identify safety loopholes and accident prone spots.
 
  They will now be assimilating their observations by corroborating them with the accident-related data of Baner Road of the past three years before submitting a final report of their suggestions to the Pune Municipal Corporation. More review visits are expected over the next couple of days.
 
 Mohd Imran, the founder of Safe Road Foundation, said, “There are engineering and human error problems on Baner Road. Saving every life is important and focusing on safety of pedestrians and cyclists can be the starting point for the civic body.”
 
 Road conditions, vehicles and humans form the three arms of the accident prevention triangle. If even one of these is missing or faulty, accidents are bound to happen, explained Samaiirah, the state director of the foundation. 
 
 Ashok Morale, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said, “A proper divider along the road is glaringly missing. Punctures in the median are also far too many.”
 
 Vivekanand Wakhare, police inspector (planning), said, “There is definitely a demand for controlling the drivers’ speed on Baner Road, which we are reviewing.”
