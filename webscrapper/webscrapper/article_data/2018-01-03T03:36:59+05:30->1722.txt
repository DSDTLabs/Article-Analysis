NOIDA: The case of   mauling a six-year-old girl has divided the Lotus Boulevard society, which houses over 2,000 residents, into two sections. One group has approached Maneka Gandhi’s office. The cops, meanwhile, have come under pressure from the other group that went to Sector 39 police station on Tuesday evening to ensure an FIR was filed in the case.

 Six dogs were picked up from the society for sterilisation on Tuesday but Noida officials said the process would not be easy as animal rights activists protested any move against strays. R S  , senior project engineer (public health), Noida, said that there were constraints even on picking up strays. 
 
 A meet of residents was called on Tuesday and was attended by  , general manager of 3C company. Residents made 12 demands, including raising the height of the boundary wall, eviction of strays from the society and increasing security in the basement. Some residents complained that dogs in the society had attacked people earlier too but were styill fed by other residents. Shivani, a resident, said those who fed the dogs were a small group but exerted a lot of pressure on other residents and the management to stop any step against strays. “The management is responsible. Tomorrow, this can happen to our child. We are paying nearly Rs 6,000 for maintenance. What is that for?” she said.
 
 Dr Nischal, incharge of Noida Animal Shelter, said, “Usually, dogs only attack in two situations — when they see an unusual face or when a female dog feels her puppies are in danger. Under most circumstances, they only bark but do not attack. There might be some facts which are being hidden.” Some society residents echoed him. “We are not blaming the child but are against harming dogs,” said Harleen Sahni.
