CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC’s grueling   schedule came to an end on Friday. The club played five matches in 18 days, the latest against   at the   in Kochi. The 2015 ISL champions picked up six points from their five matches and inched closer to a semifinal spot.

 
 Coach John Gregory was all praise for how his boys performed. “It was a really tough schedule for us. We had to play games and recover and then rest for a day before travelling to the next venue and play another game. And I had not changed my team that much. I think I had literally seven players who played all the four matches and the entire 90 minutes every game. So, it has been a huge workload for them,” Gregory said.
 
 The Briton, however, said his team’s work ethic helped Chennaiyin sail through this hectic period. “I am delighted with the amount of points we managed to get from those four matches,” he said. “One of the reasons why we are where we are at the table is because we have an amazing work ethic. The ways the boys train, the way they recover, the way they go into every match. It is really fantastic.”
 
 Chennaiyin are currently third in the table with 29 points from 17 games, but Gregory opined that staying ahead of the chasing pack in the race for a top four finish is difficult. “The hardest thing is being up front,” he remarked. “It is easier when you are coming from behind; then nothing is expected. But if somebody was to put together a few results, the teams above them would start to drop points. But this is football. That is how things pan out. And when you are out there at the front, you are the one everybody is trying to pull back.”
