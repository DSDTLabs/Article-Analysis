NEW DELHI: Some puja committees in   went the eco-friendly way and immersed   in a tank dug in their pandals. 

  and the B-block puja committee have been following the practice for five years now.
 
 The idols of Durga, along with those of Saraswati, Lakshmi, Ganesha and Kartikeya, were immersed into a 12x15ft tank following the same rituals that are carried out at the ghats. “The flowers and garlands used in the puja are also buried in a pit. When it turns into humus, it is used for maintaining the ground where the puja is held,” said P K Paul from Dakshinpally Puja Samiti.
 
 The beats of the dhaks reverberated in the air and faces smeared with vermillion were seen all around when the youths from the area carried the idols on their shoulders for  .
 
 At B-block too, the idols were immersed in a similar way. They will take about a day to dissolve, following which the water will be released into the park. “Thousands of idols are immersed in the Yamuna, causing irreparable damage. And we spend crores to clean up the mess. We want to take these small steps to help with the cleaning process,” said Tamal Rakshit from the puja committee.
 
 The general secretary of Bengal Association, Tapan Sengupta, said, “This year, we have even decided to reward the most environment-friendly puja committee”.
