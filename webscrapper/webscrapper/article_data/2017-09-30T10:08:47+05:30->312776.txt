PANCHKULA: The six-day protest being held by   mayor  , along with her supporters, ended on Friday as municipal corporation (MC) commissioner   and executive officer assured them of immediate relief by clearing all pending project works.

 Ahluwalia said, “I was fighting for the public interest as since several years, the important public interest works have been kept pending by the MC staff. Junior officers were not clearing the project work files.”
 
 Ahluwalia with over 13 councillors and resident welfare association members protested in front of the Sector 14 MC office and kept a donation box open for residents and visitors to collect funds which would help them repair or reconstruct the damaged roads and carry out other developmental works.
 
 “We have passed a list of agendas in various house meetings among which the major ones include re-carpeting of roads, shifting of dumping ground from Sector 23, recruitment of 229 sanitation workers, availability of shoes and clothes to them and sub-surface dam over  ,” Ahluwalia said.
