MYSURU: Former minister and   leader B K Chandrashekhar said on Thursday that there is confusion among BJP leaders over various issues. He pointed out that differences between BJP national president   and state president   are apparent.

 The senior Congressman told reporters that while Shah publicly disowned Janardhan Reddy, Yeddyurappa has openly said the party needs Reddy’s support.
 
 Since the former chief minister’s son Vijayendra was denied a ticket to contest from Varuna constituency, all is not well in the BJP, he said. Both Yeddyurappa and Vijayendra will teach Shah a lesson, he added.
 
 Condemning the Jammu and Kashmir rape incident and hitting out at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Chandrashekhar said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is silent about the rape incident. We are aware of the happenings in UP, no one in Karnataka needs lessons from Yogi. On an average, every day four to five rape cases are being reported in UP. Yogi has lost credibility in his own state.”
