DHARWAD:   criticized the habit of the rich to display their wealth by organizing  . 

  Speaking at the all-religion mass marriage organized by S R   near   here on Sunday, he said it is vulgar display of richness and such lavishness should come to an end. 
 
 He said that at a time when prices of all goods and services are escalating, conducting marriages have become a costly affair for the poor and middle class. "Many are forced to sell their ancestral property or get into debt trap to get their daughters married off," he said, adding that mass marriages have come as a boon to the poor. 
 
 Siddaramaiah said he was happy that unlike in the old Mysore region, people in north   are willing to encourage and participate in mass marriages. 
 
 Citing his own experience, the chief minister said when he organized a mass marriage in his constituency, he had to struggle to get couples registered for the event. Hardly 40-50 couples took part, he recalled.
