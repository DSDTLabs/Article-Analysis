Panaji: A metal kiosk, which was illegally set up near a state-protected monument—the site of the Portuguese-era gunpowder factory, better known as “Casa de Polvora”, at Panelim, Ribandar —has been cleared off. TOI had reported on the allegedly illegal kiosk along the Ribandar-Old Goa road on July 10. However, part of this extensive historical site, which is on a hillside has been lost partially to a residential complex and few residencies. A wall adjoining the road and overlooking the Ribandar riverfront is all that remains of the biggest gunpowder factory that was operational for over two centuries. The production had stopped after June 12, 1876. The state archives and archaeology department, responsible for conserving the monument among 51 others under its charge, had conducted an inspection of the site (with the illegal structure) on July 10, 2017. “We had issued a notice to the encroacher to remove the kiosk within two days,” an official said. “The kiosk was removed from the site on Friday night,” a source said. The kiosk, which is the lone structure close to the protected site, is one of the many that have sprung up along the road to Old Goa. The world heritage church complex at Old Goa and the twin temple towns of Mardol-Mangueshi draws large number of tourists. Old Goa faces a similar problem as illegal kiosks are coming up at odd spots. Panchayat authorities seem to have failed to initiate action against the encroachers and it is alleged that some panch members have stakes in these businesses, sources said.
