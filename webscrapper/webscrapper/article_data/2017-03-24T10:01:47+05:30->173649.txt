CHENNAI: Former Australian coach  , who managed the side with a lot of success from 1999 to 2007, feels both   and   have some way to go before they perfect their leadership skills. 

 “Every leader has his or her specific styles. What is more important for team leaders is that they are men of integrity, lead by example in every action and behaviour. I think both gentlemen know they have made errors in leadership, if we are analyzing their performances and using 100 percent as the only accept able grade,” Buchanan told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Smith's shortcomings notwithstanding, Buchanan still backed him as the best man for the top job. “I think there is little doubt that he is the best captaincy choice for Australia. With guidance of coach Darren Lehmann and significant voices around him at various times, his leadership skills are improving,” he said.
 
 The Decision review System (DRS) has been one of the talking points of the series and Buchanan doesn't seem to be in favour of it. “I am not a supporter of DRS as a means to enhance the adjudication of certain decisions during the course of a game. I think because of its inaccuracies and inadequacies, it can incite unnecessary tensions on-field between teams and between umpires,” he said.
 
 “If we are to retain the integrity of the game, the DRS needs significant review. If nothing else, the game should be managed by the umpires only. There should be no questioning of the umpires' decisions by emotionally charged players,” added Buchanan.
