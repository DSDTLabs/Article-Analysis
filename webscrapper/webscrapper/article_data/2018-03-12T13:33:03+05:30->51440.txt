PATNA: An   was lodged against   state president   Rai for allegedly violating the model code of conduct by making a provocative speech earlier this week during the   Lok Sabha bypolls campaign.

 While campaigning for BJP candidate Pradeep Kumar Singh at an election rally at Narpatganj in Araria district on March 9, Nityanand had allegedly said if RJD candidate Sarfaraz Alam won, the Lok Sabha constituency would “become a den of ISI”.
 
 On Saturday, Narpatganj assembly constituency’s nodal officer-cum-circle officer Nishant Kumar lodged an FIR against Nityanand with police for violating the model code of conduct. 
 
 Nityanand is also a Lok Sabha member from Ujiarpur in  . His remark did not go down well with the RJD. The party has slammed the BJP for “indulging in communal politics to polarise votes”.
 
 “Araria is one of the 38 districts in Bihar, which is governed by Nitish Kumar-led NDA government of which BJP is also a part. If Nityanand means to say Bihar is a hub of ISI, it’s a big shame for BJP and PM   because the saffron party is ruling at the Centre as well,” RJD chief Lal Prasad’s younger son and leader of opposition in legislative assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said on Saturday.
