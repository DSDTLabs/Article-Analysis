CHANDIGARH: A three-minute video of Punjab education minister Aruna Choudhary’s husband chairing offiical meeting at civil secretariat that has gone viral on Thursday sparked a row in the state.

 Punjab chief minister   has orderd an inquiry and asked Aruna to explain her husband Ashok’s presence in the meeting.
 
 In the video, Ashok, a retired government employee, is heard reassuring a caller that a teacher can remain posted at a particular school. He is also seen casually sifting through the official documents lying on the table.
 
 The video has been shot inside the offical room for the education minister. Ashok’s casual remarks to media after the video went viral did not seem to have gone down well with Amarinder.
 
 Ashok said, “A husband can always accompany his wife for good things. Good couples do things together. What’s the big deal in this?”
 
 Amarinder, however, issued a strong statement, saying, “Such behaviour was not proper and could not be condoned.”
 
 He later added that Aruna would be able to control any such interference in the future. Aruna is a three-time   from Dinanagar in Gurdaspur district. She is one of the two women ministers of Amarinder cabinet.
