MOHALI: The dogs living within the   Municipal limits will soon have a unique identification number, embedded on a microchip which will installed under their hide.   is mulling over the move to outsource the process of embedding a chip in every stray dog found on streets. The agenda point may be raised in the forthcoming MC house meet. 

 This move will create a databank of the stray and pet dogs in city, said Mayor Kulwant Singh. "An NGO has recently given a presentation to MC officials and councilors in this regard. The NGO claimed that it will fix a chip in each stray dog containing complete information about the animal. They will also conduct a zonal census of the  . Thereafter, it will carry out the sterilization and dog capturing activity on the lines of existing rates. We have decided to bring the agenda point in next house meet to get the clearance," he said.
 
 While explaining the salient features of fixing a chip in a stray dog, the NGO representative Nilesh said that the digital identification of pet dogs will replace the conventional cumbersome procedure of granting licenses for pets.
 
 "The chip implant, an integrated circuit placed under the skin of the animal, will allow officials to maintain complete information about the dog, including its age, vaccination details and owner's name and address," stated Nilesh.
 
 "The chip, about size of a large rice grain with a 14-digit number, uses passive radio frequency identification technology to identify the animals. It will be injected under the neck of the animal in a simple process which will be similar to administering an injection," he added.
