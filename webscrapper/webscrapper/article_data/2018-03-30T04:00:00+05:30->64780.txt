Chennai: Mid-level executive fraud at banks — frauds between Rs 1 to Rs 25 lakh — have nearly tripled in the last five years, RBI’s reply to an RTI application said.

 Banks reported a 177% increase in frauds to Rs 23,984 crore, up from Rs 8,649 crore in 2013. 
 
 Just in the last one year, frauds have grown 30% from Rs 18,699 crore in 2016 — the data measures only frauds between Rs 1-25 lakh. 
 
 In 2015, Punjab National Bank had accounted for 11% of total banking frauds, as per the RTI application filed by TOI. The same set of information was requested under RTI for the years 2016 and 2017, but RBI said ‘bank-wise data on fraud is not available for disclosure in terms of section 28 of Banking Regulation Act 1949.’ 
 
 Frauds from Mumbai have been increasing in the last five years; with Maharashtra now accounting for more than 40% of total banking frauds in 2017, up from 35% in 2013. The state of Karnataka accounts for 16% (Rs 3,733 crore) of total frauds in India, Delhi 10% (Rs 2,495 crore), Chandigarh 8.5% (Rs 2,048) and West Bengal 8% (Rs 1,959 crore). 
 
 When it came to number of fraudulent cases, year-over-year there has been a 8% increase to 5,078 cases registered in 2017, compared to 4,693 cases in 2016. Chandigarh sees the most high-value fraud in the country — with the average case being registered — resulting in a loss of more than Rs 55.35 crore registered. States such as Maharashtra and Karnataka saw frauds of about Rs 8.5 crore per case —higher than the national average of Rs 4.74 crore being lost in every case. States like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu saw more low-value frauds with average being Rs 3.13 crore and Rs 1 crore being lost in the respective states. Delhi sees the bank on average losing Rs 4.8 crore for every fraudulent case reported.
 
 Credit rating agency Experian said that loan account fraud is witnissing an increase in fraudulent contact information provided by applications. “Identity theft or creation of fictious identities continues to contribute around 3/4th of all detected fraud cases. But one noticeable difference is fraud by repeated offenders has declined. We would attribute this to institutions putting more processes in place to check historical fraud profiles and improved detection techniques,” said Mohan Jeyaram from Experian, earlier in an interview.
 
 “Consumer loans and personal loans have the highest instance of frauds, this is followed by credit cards, two-wheeler and then mortgage loan fraud (which is the least),” he added.
