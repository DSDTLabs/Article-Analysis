PATNA: State agriculture minister   on Wednesday slammed the Congress saying it neglected the agriculture sector during its around five decades of rule in the state.

 He also pulled up the UPA led by Congress for not acting on the recommendations made for the introduction of neem-coated urea in the country 20 years ago. Against that, the central government led by PM Modi took the bold decision to introduce the use of neem-coated urea by the farmers.
 
 “The introduction of neem-coated urea has ended the sale of urea and chemical fertilizers on black market. It also prevented the diversion of urea for use in the non-farming activities,” Kumar said.
 
 He, accompanied by state BJP vice-president Devesh Kumar at the party’s state headquarters, was pointing at the achievements of PM Modi made in the last four years. The party has already been celebrating the PM’s achievements in the last four years and it would continue till June 11.
 
 Kumar said since the NDA government came to power in the state, sustained efforts were made to improve and strengthen the agriculture sector. Its results bore fruit in 2016-17, as both production of foodgrain and productivity of the land increased. Consequently, total foodgrain production reached 185.61 lakh metric tonne in 2016-17 and productivity was 27.77 quintal per hectare, he said, adding that maize also recorded record production.
 
 Right from 2015-16, farmers from the state have been given ‘Krishi Karman’ award on several occasions, while Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) at Aurangabad also won the Deendayal Updhayaya award for excellence, Kumar said.
