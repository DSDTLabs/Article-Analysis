LCD Sounds system front man   has revealed he was in talks with   about making a joint record before he died. 

  
  
 The 'All My Friends' hitmaker said he recorded some percussion on the late music legend's final record 'Blackstar' and that they had been in talks to record their own material. "I reached out to David and said, 'I'd love to do a record just me and you'. He said, 'It's funny yo mention that, please look me up when you get back to New York'," Murphy said. 
 
 The 47-year-old   was surprised he even spoke with the 'Heroes' singer - who passed away in January 2016 after a secret battle with cancer. "I don't think I could have talked to him. And that's saying a lot because I knew David Bowie, I talked to David Bowie. I thought I couldn't talk to him, but he was so gracious and so friendly."
 
 "I had an email friendship with David Bowie, which one of the weirder, more amazing things".
