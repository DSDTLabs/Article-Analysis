MOHALI: The   machine purchased by the municipal corporation costs Rs 28 lakh, but was purchased for Rs 1.79 crore. The vetting review of the machine was conducted by a chief engineer of the local bodies department.

 Another irregularity found in the deal was that the MC released partial payment for the machine prior to receiving the vetting report and issuance of work orders to the supplier.
 
 Deputy mayor  , along with councillors   Sohal and Sukhdev Singh Patwari, had detected the irregularity. They said that public money was wasted, as the payment was made a year ago, but the machine was of no use.
 
 Local bodies minister   said, “The machine was priced at Rs 28 lakh in the country and Rs 80 lakh abroad. But a resolution was passed for purchasing it at an exorbitant price of Rs 1.79 crore and orders were placed for its purchase.”
 
 The tree pruning machine was imported from   and a team from oversees had visited to train the employee of the company, to which the MC had outsourced the task.
