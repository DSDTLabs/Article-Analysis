LUCKNOW: After a humiliating defeat in UP assembly polls, BSP chief   announced on Wednesday that her party would go to court and hold agitation against the BJP, which, she said tampered with the electronic voting machines. Addressing media at the party headquarters in Lucknow, after paying tributes to her party founder Kanshi Ram on his birth anniversary, Mayawati said her party will organise demonstration on the 11th of every month in all district headquarters of UP and state headquarters of other states. 

 The BSP was reduced to meagre 19 seats, down from 80 in 2012, even as BJP and its allies soared to 325 seats, one of the highest tally in the recent history. The decline of BSP in   have, in fact, come to threaten the political fate of BSP and its boss Mayawati.
 
 "We are not going to sit quiet," said Mayawati, adding that the BJP's victory was fake and achieved through unfair means. "The faces and language of BJP leaders show that their victory is unfair," she said. Daring the BJP to get repolling done through ballot papers to "prove its honesty", she said, "But I know BJP will never do so. They are afraid that their fraud would be exposed."
 
 Mayawati said it seemed that the tampering with EVMs was done strategically only in UP and Uttarakhand. "Had it been in other states, the BJP would have been exposed," she said, even as party workers raised a slogan: " Loktantra ki hatya band karo...(stop murdering democracy)". 
 
  The BSP chief added that BJP was spreading rumour that Muslim women voted in its favour on the issue of triple talaq. "There cannot be a bigger lie than that. Muslims will follow their religion, not BJP," she said. 
 
 Invoking the ideology of party founder Kanshiram, Mayawati said political parties with casteist mindset had always tried to suppress the poor and downtrodden, essentially the Dalits and Other Backward Castes.
