Bhopal: Elected representatives of Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) would meet on Tuesday to once again vote on establishment of controversial slaughterhouse facility at Adampur Chhawni on the outskirts of the state capital. 

 On September 20, state government overruled BMC council’s unanimous vote that opposed establishment of abattoir facility within municipal limits. Notice from urban development and housing department (UAHD) termed a proposal passed by BMC earlier in August as against directives of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and violation of Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956. Section 257 (1) mandates that municipal body needs to adhere to the state government directives.
 
 Indications are Tuesday’s BMC meeting would once again lead to sustained opposition to the establishment of the facility. Internal politics within the ruling BJP corporators has annulled the move. 
 
 The opposition to slaughterhouse facility is led by BJP’s Huzur MLA Rameshwar Sharma. Sharma and his supporters reiterated their opposition on Monday as well. “We would not allow establishment of the abattoir facility in Adampur. State government needs to find an alternative site,” said Shivam, a resident of Adampur.
 
 BMC allocated Rs 2 crore for building the state-of-the-art facility at Adampur Chhawani. The same location is also project site for establishment of municipal solid waste facility for the BMC. 
 
 On August 3, BJP-majority civic body elected representatives unanimously turned down a proposal for establishment of the abattoir in Adampur. 
 
 In 2016, the state government had taken a stance over setting up of a modern abattoir facility 15km from Bhopal. NGT has directed the state government to shift the old slaughter house at Jinsi (Jehangirabad) outside city limits by March 2018.
