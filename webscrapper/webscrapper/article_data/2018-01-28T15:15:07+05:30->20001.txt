PATNA: The state   on Saturday maintained there was no trouble in the   NDA, even as leader of the opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said he would welcome the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Hindustani Awam Morcha – Secular (HAM-S) if they decided to join the RJD fold.

 “All the NDA constituents are united and will fight the parliamentary and assembly polls as one,” said deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday.
 
 Asked if the parliamentary and assembly elections would be held simultaneously, Modi said he had no such information, but added, “BJP and JD(U) are always ready for the polls.”
 
 The four constituents of Bihar NDA are JD(U) led by CM  , Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) led by Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, RLSP led by Union minister Upendra Kushwaha and HAM(S) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi.
 
 Interacting with his supporters on Friday, Tejashwi said the RJD would rather welcome Kushwaha and Manjhi if they decided to join it. The RJD has   and its ally, but other political parties opposed to the BJP are expected to veer around it. Tejashwi has already announced ‘Nyay Yatra’ from February 9 while Congress has also planned its own separate ‘yatra’. 
 
 “Why will any party, especially from the NDA, like to ride the RJD boat that has a lot of holes in it?” deputy CM Modi asked and said the stock of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, now in jail in fodder scam cases, has only been sliding since 1996.
 
 “Lalu had won 167 of the 324 assembly seats in 1995, but his tally went down to 22 in 2010,” Modi said, adding Tejashwi’s tour is unlikely to improve the RJD stock as the fodder and other scams, including the ones in which he himself has been implicated, are very much alive in public mind and, therefore, he would have to do a lot of explaining.
