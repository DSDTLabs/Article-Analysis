In a one of its kind event, several ladies of the city, all from non-acting backgrounds, are coming together to showcase their acting acting talent in a soon-to-be-staged play Main Akhandani. We caught up with the ladies while they rehearsed for the play under the experienced guidance and mentoring of award winning theatre director  . "The seeds of this unique musical presentation were sown a few months ago when my friend   and I, decided to stretch our combined creative talent and passion for literature, music and theatre, beyond their respective professional domains,”" shares  , an architect by profession, who plays a pivotal role in the play. 
She adds, "There are a total of 25 females in the play. The story has a sutradhar and is based on the navrasa. We have picked up some lesser known characters of the Mahabharata and Ramayana and will be staging several musical acts from their perspective. Take for example   from Ramayana. We will stage an act of what emotions and turmoil Urmila went through when   went to vanvaas with Ram and Sita. So it will be interesting to watch all these short stories."
 It wasn't an easy task to get the cast of the play together recalls Shubhra. “Since many women in our play are homemakers, it was a challenging task for them to convince their families to let them off for a few hours each day to rehearse for the play. They have been rehearsing for the play for the past two months for around four hours daily," she says.
 And this is the just the beginning promises Shubhra. "We will now be staging many more such plays in times to come."
