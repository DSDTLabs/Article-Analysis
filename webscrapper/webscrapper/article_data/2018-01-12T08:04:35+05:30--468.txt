BHOPAL: The state capital needs to improve its street lights and better public transport, indicates a safety analysis audit supported by UN Women, a dedicated wing of   for gender equality and empowerment of women.

 Unplanned development and encroachments along commercial zones make Bhopal unsafe for women. The report comes in the backdrop of incidents of rape and death of a commuter in a bus. Besides using a mobile application, manual audit was conducted post sunset till 10 pm with support from Sangini gender resource centre and WRI India along with primary partner Safetipin.
 
 
  
 
 
 Personal safety and   app, co-founder and CEO,   said, “Safetipin is a very simple tool to understand why certain public spaces are safer than others and provide recommendation on how to make places safer. Our aim is to ensure that all women and girls feel safer and are able to access the city and all areas.” “We have reviewed the findings of the report. Many of the ‘dark’ spots identified across the city have been lit and another survey would be carried out to check for improvements,” said a BMC official.
 
 Security, gender usage, visibility and crowd have been rated poorly for most parts of the city. 180 km of road length was mapped generating 4,389 locations. Overall, the safety score for Bhopal is rated 2.9/5 that is considered to be ‘fair’. The survey carried out in second half of 2017.
