MUMBAI: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s decision to expand the scope of the Rs 34,022-crore   to include farmers who had restructured their loans till 2016, will cost the state government an additional Rs 3,000 crore-Rs 4,000 crore. Also, nearly seven lakh farmers, who were earlier excluded from the waiver since they were not defaulters, will benefit from this state decision.

 State officials said the decision would further increase the state’s  , but as there was a demand from all quarters to extend the scope of farm waiver, the government decided give in.
 
 The Maharashtra government has already made a budget allocation of Rs 20,000 crore in the supplementary expenditure statement that was tabled last week in the legislature. However, the challenge to increase the funds continues to dog the state government which has already put in place several cuts in the expenditure and austerity measures to cope with the mounting crisis.
 
 Chief minister Devendra   on Thursday had said that the loan waiver would be applicable to families of debt-hit farmers who committed suicide. He added that the state would consider extending the loan waiver benefit to the families of serving army jawans who are engaged in farming. They are currently excluded in the eligibility criteria. 
 
 Fadnavis announced that the state would soon launch an app through which farmers could apply for the waiver of loans taken between 2012 and 2015.
 
 While the government was paying an incentive to farmers who had repaid their loans till 2016, it could consider continuing it in future too, he added.
