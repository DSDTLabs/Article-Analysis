LUCKNOW: Just two days ahead of BJP chief Amit Shah’s scheduled visit to Rae Bareli, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader  , also an accused in Babri Masjid demolition case, on Thursday began a ‘Bhagwat Katha’ in neighbouring Amethi, the constituency of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, bringing the spotlight on heightened activity in the Congress stronghold ahead of 2019 elections.

 The ‘katha’, organised by BJP leader and Amethi-based industrialist,   alias Rajesh ‘Masala’, a spice czar, will culminate on April 27 with a grand event scheduled to be attended by Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Smriti Irani, informed sources in BJP told TOI. Agrahari said that women devotees will take out a customary ‘Kalash Yatra’ before the ‘katha’. “Yeh aayojan Bhagwan Jagannath ke prati hamari astha ka hai....,” he said, while speaking to reporters. Formerly a member of Samajwadi Party, Agrahari was expelled by Akhilesh Yadav soon after 2014 Lok Sabha elections for ‘anti-party activities’. He later joined BJP.
 
 Sadhvi Rithambara, a Ludhiana-born Hindu preacher, came into prominence with her fiery speeches during the Ram Temple movement. She was indicted by the Liberhan Commission in 2009 and recently by the Supreme Court in August 2017. The Sadhvi, famous for her oratory skills, is also the founding chairperson of  , the women’s wing of VHP. She is a member of VHP’s Marg Darshak Mandal. She was approached by some senior BJP leaders for conducting the ‘katha’ in Amethi.
 
 BJP spokesperson in Amethi, Govind Chauhan said that a host of senior party leaders are expected to attend the ‘katha’.
 
 The event, not surprisingly, is timed with scheduled visit of BJP chief Amit Shah in neighbouring Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, on Saturday.
 
 Some senior  , including MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh, who quit the party earlier this month, are expected to join BJP in Shah’s presence.
