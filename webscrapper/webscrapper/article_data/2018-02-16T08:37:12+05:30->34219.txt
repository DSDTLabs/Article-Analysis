KANPUR:  , one of the three localities in Bangarmau town of   from where several   were reported, have barred   saying that “irresponsible” reporting has brought “infamy” to the locality.

 At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau’s three localities — Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur — after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients.
 
 Of these, a majority of cases were reported from Prem Ganj. “Media has been banned from entering Prem Ganj,” a group of locals shouted when some TV journalists tried to enter the area on Thursday.
 
 Shiv Prasad, one of the agitators, said: “Mediapersons throng the locality in our absence and ask silly questions. Then they report nonsense. Till date, local media has not reported our issues, so we have banned its entry.”
 
 The villagers said they will also install a board with a note at the entrance of the locality to inform the media to stay away. “We are hurt over some channels reporting that brothels are being run in the locality leading to spread of HIV,” said an old woman.
 
 “When people of the village don’t want the media to enter, I am no one to oppose their will,” said local corporator Sunil Kumar.
