VIJAYAWADA: Controversial TDP MLA   Umameshwara Rao was in the news again on Sunday. The latest controversy erupted after allegations of   grabbing were levelled against him and his wife.

 The complainant, identified as K   from  , owns land at Budameru area in Krishna district, which is said to be worth Rs 40 crore. 
 
 Based on Babu’s complaint, the Crime Investigation Department (CID) registered an FIR on January 23 against Umamaheswara Rao’s wife Bonda Sujatha and seven others. They were booked for grabbing land allocated to a freedom fighter named Kesireddy Suryanarayana at Budameru area in Krishna district. K Suresh Babu is a descendant of the late Suryanarayana.
 
 On January 20, the CID interrogated an accused, identified as Ramireddy Koteswara Rao, and his son named Suresh Rao. Both are lorry drivers by profession, and live in Krishna Lanka area in Vijayawada.
 
 CID sources told TOI that family members of Suryanarayana lodged a complaint with them. During the investigation, they found that the accused had created fake documents with forged signatures and showed Koteswara Rao as owner. “Related sections of forgery, trespassing freedom fighter’s land, kidnapping and threatening have been filed against the six, and we will soon take action,” CID SP L Kalidas said.
 
 Meanwhile, the MLA denied the allegations, and said he lost interest in the land deal after he found that it was disputed land between the family. He said he cancelled the agreement. “The YSR Congress is making false against me. We have nothing to do with the land issue any more,” he said in a TV interview. 
 
 Koteswara Rao then approached police commissioner D Gautam Sawang on Sunday, and filed a complaint saying he has been receiving threats from the Bonda  . Sawang assured him that necessary action will be taken. Rao said they approached TDP corporator   for money three years ago, and he asked them to register their land on his name as surety, and gave Rs 5 lakh as loan.
