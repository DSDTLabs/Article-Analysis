He may be a ‘Rangeela’ on screen — that’s the name of his multi-layered character in   show ' ' — but in real life,   is loyal and committed. Sources say the actor is dating his former co-actor Harshita Gaur. “They are quite serious about each other, but haven’t made it official yet,” says a source.

 Ask Param about his relationship status and he reluctantly admits, “Initially, we were just good friends. However, I would be jealous whenever other men showered her with attention. That’s when I realised we could be more than friends.”
 
 So, is he possessive about her romancing another hero on screen? “No. It’s part of our job and we have to be cool about it. Both Harshita and I are passionate about work and career comes first for us,” he asserts. 
 
 About  , he says, “For Rangeela, his maalik is above everyone. However, I am as loyal as a dog towards my family and relationship. I am hardworking as a donkey and a tamed lion at the same time.”
 
 Though he plays the male lead, the first few promos of the show focussed on actor Vikkas Manaktala. Ask him if he was apprehensive about his screen time and he replies, “We have to show Vikkas larger than life because only then will my character have the desired impact when he stands up against him. I know my potential and I am not an insecure actor even if the other person gets more screen-time.”
