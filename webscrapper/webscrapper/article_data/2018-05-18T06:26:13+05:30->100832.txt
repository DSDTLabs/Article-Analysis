CHENNAI: The   has permitted the state government to go ahead with admission to PG medical courses but made it clear that incentive marks for in-service candidates could not be extended to doctors working in emergency and critical care units. Though many other states have completed the process well ahead of the SC-mandated May 31 deadline, the process remains stuck in   over the government's decision to extend incentive marks benefits to doctors serving in emergency and critical care units in cities as well. 

 "The government is directed to complete the selection process and proceed with the admission as indicated in the schedule for the academic year 2018-19. It is made clear that the weightage (incentive) by way of additional marks ought not to be extended to A3 category (doctors working in emergency and critical care units) which, as per the earlier conclusion, is not entitled to such benefit," ruled a division bench of   and Justice P D Audikesavalu on Thursday.
 
 The court also mooted appointment of a retired judge of the high court to head the expert committee mandated to identify 'remote' and 'difficult' service stations entitled to claim incentive marks for serving government doctors aspiring to join PG medical courses.
 
 As per PG medical admission norms, government doctors serving in remote and difficult areas are entitled to incentive marks, to the maximum of 10% of their PG-NEET marks with 30% as ceiling.
