KOCHI: The CBSE’s submission in   high court that the girl student from   who claimed that she was given a wrong question paper for the class X Mathematics exam had “fabricated a story as she was weak in the subject” has thrown up more questions than answers.

 Principals affiliated to   have questioned as to how the girl,  , could have escaped filling the roll number in the question paper and verification by invigilator if she had used her brother’s question paper from 2016. They also asked how the girl could have managed to carry her brother’s question paper to the hall given the strict rules for exam conduct.
 
 The girl had appeared for the exam at   in Kottayam on March 28 and the high court had earlier this month allowed the CBSE to give a retest to her. The board said in its counter affidavit that the student was trying to mislead authorities and she was not entitled for any discretionary relief.
