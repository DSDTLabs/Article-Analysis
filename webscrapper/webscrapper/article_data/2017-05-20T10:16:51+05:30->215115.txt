CHENNAI: City police commissioner   is showing that he can walk the talk.

 When he took office on Monday, the city police chief promised ‘citizen-friendly policing’. It’s too early to take a call on whether he has kept his word but, four days since then, he has taken action in that direction even if it has been at the expense of his own men who have committed offences or failed to perform their duty.
 
 After police on Wednesday   Sundaravadivel of the secretariat police, for taking 20kg of ganja to his house from a crime scene, Viswanathan on Friday suspended an inspector for failing to file an FIR on a complaint by a woman who lost her gold chain to robbers.
 
 A police officer said Helen Christina, 30, a software engineer with a firm in the  , was heading home after work on her scooter late on Wednesday when she noticed that two men were following her on a motorcycle.
 
 “The men overtook Christina’s scooter and stopped her on the Padi bridge,” he said. “They assaulted her, pushing her to the ground, before making away with her 6-sovereign gold chain.”
 
 Christina, who sustained bruises, cried out for help but at that hour of the night there was no one to come to her aid. She somehow made it to the Thiruverkadu police station.
 
 “Crime inspector S Jayachandran was at the station and heard Christina’s complaint,” the officer said. “Instead of taking action, he directed her to the Nolambur police.”
 
 Christina then went to the Nolambur station, where policemen said the crime took place in the jurisdiction of the Thiruverkadu police. After policemen made the woman shuttle back and forth, she alerted the police control room.
 
 When commissioner Vishwanathan heard about her ordeal on Friday, he took matters into his hands. He issued orders to suspend the inspector for doing nothing to help Christina.
 
 “This will serve as a warning to policemen who fail to take action when they should,” a senior police officer said.
