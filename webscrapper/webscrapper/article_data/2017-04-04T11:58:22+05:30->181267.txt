PUNE: A group of Pune corporators have urged the   ( ) not to take any step to denotify national and   in the city.

 Denotification will prove a lifeline to more than 1,600 liquor vends in Pune district. 
 
 Members of the   (RPI) contended in a letter that denotification will favour the liquor industry, but cause harm to citizens and the civic administration, and demanded a total ban on the sale of liquor.
 
 “The decision is good for the overall health of the citizens and society,” the group said in the letter. “The state should declare a total ban on liquor. States like Gujarat and Bihar have banned liquor, while Kerala has a partial ban,” the letter further said. 
 
 The letter was submitted to the standing committee, and converted into a proposal which is expected to be discussed on Wednesday. 
 
 “Denotification will affect PMC’s finances, as a major share of the tax paid by Pune’s citizens will have to be spent on the upkeep of the highways,” Siddhartha Dhende, an RPI corporator, told TOI.
 
 As per the civic administration officials, a section of the Pune-Mumbai highway, Pune-Solapur highway, Pune-Ahmednagar highway and Pune-Satara road pass through the city. 
 
 “We have read the guidelines. The roads department has been discussing this issue with the excise department. The officials have asked us for our view on the ban, and what stand the administration will take on this matter. But we have yet to decide our future course of action,” said Rajendra Raut, head of PMC’s roads department.
