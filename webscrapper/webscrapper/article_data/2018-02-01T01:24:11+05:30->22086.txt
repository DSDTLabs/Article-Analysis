NEW DELHI: Delhi saw yet another ‘warm’ day, with both maximum and minimum temperatures recorded above normal on Wednesday. The capital’s maximum was recorded at 25.4 degrees Celsius — three notches above normal, and met officials forecast temperature to rise even higher on Thursday. The warm conditions along with an increase in wind speed, however, has helped Delhi’s air quality.

 The forecast for Thursday shows shallow fog during the morning. The maximum is likely to touch 26 degrees, and the minimum would hover around 10 degrees Celsius. “The chance of the minimum going too low is now gone. There will be a drop ahead but the coldest days are gone,” said a RWFC scientist.
 
 It was also the cleanest day in terms of Delhi’s air quality this week, with an AQI of 244 recorded. A reading between 201 to 300 is classified as “poor” according to the index, however it is an improvement over readings of 300 and above which Delhi was seeing last week.
