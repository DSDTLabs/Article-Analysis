MUMBAI: The arrest of   looks good just ahead of the 25th anniversary of the deadly 1993 serial blasts that comes up Monday, March 12, but the interminable delay in — or rather the unlikeliness of — bringing main accused   and   to book has forced the victims’ families to all but give up hopes of justice.

 Sunil Sawant, who lost sister Suchita in the explosion in  , says: “Yes they have caught another culprit today. But what about the main person? And what did we do with those whom we already apprehended? Some are enjoying biryani inside secure prisons, a couple died because of their karma. How is the law dealing with them? I sometimes feel India is the safest place for terrorists who face threats abroad.”
 
 Sawant points at the corruption and lethargy affecting the Indian political system and says things have worsened with successive governments. “Until they apprehend the mastermind, the rest is lip service. In India, the maximum you may get is 14 years in jail. And that too they may release you prematurely on Gandhi Jayanti. Can you commit such crimes in the US and get away lightly?” he says.
 
 Goldsmith Kanaya Kakad of J K Jewellers in   has witnessed multiple terrorist attacks strike the trade hub. March 1993 was the first of the series. “The 1993 blasts wrecked India emotionally. The big showroom of Mehta & Sons near Tribhovandas was blown apart. The jewellers’ family lost its young son. I am pleased that 25 years later, the authorities have caught one more convict. But what I really want to know is where is Dawood Ibrahim? Is he alive, is he dead?” he asked.
 
 “And if we do bring these terrorists back from their safe havens, do we have a mechanism to punish them as they deserve? Or do we preserve them as we do Abu Salem, because we promised a foreign government that we will not execute him,” says the jeweller.
