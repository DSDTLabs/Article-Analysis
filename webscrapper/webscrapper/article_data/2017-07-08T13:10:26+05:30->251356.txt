Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, was photographed on the sets of 'Avengers: Infinity War'. 

 Rudd is the latest actor, who has been spotted filming for the upcoming Marvel movie, after pictures of Robert Downey Jr ( ), Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange),   (Hulk) and Benedict Wong (Wong) from the set in Atlanta surfaced online.
 
  
  
 Rudd, in Scott Lang's daily outfit, was seen running with all his might from someone or something unseen in the images. 
 
 His character was last seen in 'Captain America: Civil War' being freed by Captain America from The Raft, a prison meant to keep those who refused to sign the Sokovia Accords in check.
