NEW DELHI: Holding that irreversible damage is done to the judicial system by   going on strike, the Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to act tough against erring advocates and Bar associations that passed resolutions for strike and directed the Centre to file quarterly reports on the basis of which contempt proceedings would be initiated against them. 

  A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said   declared 15 years ago lawyers could not go on strike but the order was being flouted rampantly, resulting in delays in delivery of justice. 
 
  "Since the strikes are in violation of law laid down by this court, the same amount to contempt and at least the office bearers of the associations that give call for strikes cannot disown their liability for contempt. Every resolution to go on strike and abstain from work is per se contempt.... It is necessary to provide for some mechanism to enforce the law laid down by this court, pending a legislation to remedy the situation," the bench said. 
 
  The bench said lawyers going on strike was one of the major reason for huge pendency of cases and the time had come to deal with the problem. "By every strike, irreversible damage is suffered by the judicial system, particularly consumers of justice. They are denied access to justice. Tax payers' money is lost on account of judicial and public time being lost," it said. 
 
  According to the Uttarakhand HC, advocates were on strike for 455 days from 2012- 2016 (on average, 91 days per year). The figures for UP   are the worst and the periods of strike over five years in the worst affected districts were - Muzaffarnagar (791 days), Faizabad (689 days),   (594 days), Varanasi (547 days), Chandauli (529 days), Ambedkar Nagar (511 days), Saharanpur (506 days) and Jaunpur (510 days).
