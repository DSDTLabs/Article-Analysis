Panaji: Films spanning 20 minutes or less showcased Goan culture, cuisine and folklore through the eyes of millenials at the Goa Online Short Film Festival, at Panaji, on Monday.

 Held for the first time in the state, the festivalwhich comprised films made by college studentswas aimed at taking stories of contemporary Goa to the diaspora and inspiring a quest for an identity for all things Goan. 
 
 Among the many films that evoked feelings of nostalgia, was a film titled, ‘Homecoming’. It follows the trajectory of a young girl called Jennifer, who travels solo to Goa to learn more about her roots. Exposed only to canned food in the UK, Jennifer takes on a whole new culinary journey in Bardez, exploring college canteens, beach shacks and even dingy restaurants. 
 
 “The memory of her mother’s homemade xitt-kodi (fish curry-rice) is what puts her on a quest for the perfect fish thali,” said St Xavier’s College student Harriet Fernandes, a part of the film’s production team.
 
 The festival was organised by WHN Digital, which will broadcast all the participating films on its online entertainment platform, Goencho Balcao. Launched last year, the website showcases Goan films, Konkani music videos and tiatrs with the intent of sharing them with Goans scattered across the world.
 
 “While it is important to keep up with socio-political news, trends in the entertainment industry are also of interest to the Goan community abroad,” said partner, WHN Digital, Assis Cardozo.
