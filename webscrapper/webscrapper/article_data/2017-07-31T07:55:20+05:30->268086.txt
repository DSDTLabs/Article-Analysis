BELAGAVI: The 5.65 lakh families of   zilla panchayat (ZP) have till October 2 this year to build a toilet at home barring which their ration cards will carry a 'no toilet' stamp. 

 The 'seal of zeal', say panchayat authorities, is part of efforts to make the district and state open-defecation free by 2018 under the Swachh Bharat mission. "The seal of 'no toilet' will be put on ration cards after October 2. For the time being, we are going to create awareness by asking our Asha workers to go door-to-door to the households that do not have a toilet," said the chief executive officer of the ZP, R  . 
 
 From August 1 to October 2, 3,450 Asha workers will go door-to-door to create awareness on building toilets. After October 2, the zilla panchayat will identify one of the 10 taluks under their jurisdiction to launch a pilot project to stamp ration cards. Officials said people queueing u p at ration shops would be asked if they had a toilet at home. If the customer replied in the negative, the seal will be affixed on his ration card. The ZP would independently verify the card holders' claims, they said. 
 
 According to a survey conducted by the ZP in 2012 under the   government's  , 3.35 lakh of the 5.65 la kh households did not have a toilet. But over the last five years, the ZP managed to provide partial funding for the construction of toilets and managed to get some 4.53 lakh families to build toilets. 
 
  With time running out for the remaining 1.9 lakh households, the ZP decided on stamping ration cards. Ramachandran said the seal was being prepared and the ZP was working out the finer details. "For instance, there is a concern that most of these ration cards are laminated. The seal will easily rub off if put on the lamination. So we are looking at other methodologies," he said.
