MEERUT: Alarmed with the rising number of accidents due to ‘black spots’ in the city, an amount of Rs 19.36 lakh was released three months earlier for the repair of 11 of these spots. But the proposal has now hit a roadblock due to bureaucratic hurdles and lack of communication between the transport department and   (PWD). While the budget was released for 11 blind spots by the transport department, the   said it had given an estimate for three identified spots only. With the tussle continuing and the financial year coming to an end, the money if not used is likely to go back to the government’s exchequer.

 Detailing about the issue, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement) Deepak Shah said, “A budget of Rs 19.36 lakh was released for   region to repair some black spots in a bid to prevent further accidents. The budget was released in December last year and instructions were given to complete work in this financial year. There has been confusion with the amount allocated by the transport department and the PWD has refused to go ahead with the repair work.” As many as 198 deaths took place from 2015-16 in the 11 accident black spots, officials said. Instructions were issued by the transport department to click ‘before and after’ photographs of these black spots and send them to the additional transport commissioner, UP, so that there is proof of the work carried out in the ground level. 
 
 “We did not send evaluations for 11 black spots but three. Even though the   (RTO) has asked us to go ahead with the repair work, there has been no communication from the transport department for us to act on this budget,” said  , assistant engineer, PWD. RTO authorities have, in the meanwhile, written to the Lucknow headquarters regarding the confusion but no reply has been received till now. “We are continuously trying to get the matter sorted. Otherwise, we will have to surrender the money,” said Shah.
