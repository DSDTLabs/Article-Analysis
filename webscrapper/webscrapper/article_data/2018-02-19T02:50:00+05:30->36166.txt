Vijayawada: State finance minister   Ramakrishnudu on Sunday came down heavily on Congress leader Jairam Ramesh for his remarks on Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act (2014).

 Slamming the Congress leader for saying that the Act was not prepared well, he felt that the BJP and the TDP should make changes to it. “Is it not true that the Congress had played a big drama at the time of state bifurcation. Are you not responsible for for the terms used in the Act like ‘may’, ‘shall’ and ‘feasibility study’ for the support that AP should be given?’’ he wondered.
 
 The Congress had committed a great sin by not providing clarity on many supportive measures for the state except for a few things like railway zone. “Jairam Ramesh did great injustice to Andhra Pradesh though he became the Rajya Sabha Member under the AP quota,” he said. Meanwhile, water resources minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao criticised the Congress leader for not including the mandals to be submerged by the Polavaram project in AP at the time of bifurcation.
