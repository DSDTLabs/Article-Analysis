CHENNAI: A 'reformed' burglar, who has studied MSc psychology and has been successfully running a rehabilitation centre at  , took to crime again after he was faced with financial crisis arising out of an orphanage he was constructing on the outskirts of the city. 

 As luck would have it, he was caught in the act and put behind bars by city police on Wednesday.
 
  alias 'Powder' Sekar of Nolambur was involved in a series of burglaries and house break-ins at Nolambur and   areas.

 The Nolambur police registered a case and arrested Sekar. He was remanded in judicial custody after being produced before a magistrate court in the city.
 
 Sekar, who was addicted to drugs, had been involved in burglaries and robberies to meet his daily expenses. He was arrested by police and then he got admitted to a rehabilitation centre at Thiruverkadu. 
 
 After his discharge from the addiction rehab centre, he decided to venture into business. He then started a de-addiction centre at Thiruverkadu and named it 'Spirit of Freedom'.
