NEW DELHI: The 'pakoda wars' were back with a vengeance on Tuesday, when   chief minister   dished out some saucy remarks to   workers selling hot fritters outside the state assembly.

 
 The Congress has been protesting against Prime Minister  's now infamous statement on job creation by setting up pakoda vends in various states, which has earned the ire of the ruling  .
 
 But Congress legislators got a surprise when CM Manohar Lal Khattar, en route to attend the budget session in the Haryana assembly, stopped by their 'rehri' (cart) and bought some pakodas. This, Khattar explained, was his way of helping the Congress party which was currently "unemployed", i.e. not in power, in the state.
 
 "If anyone is getting employment by selling pakodas, it's a good thing. They had become unemployed, but now they have got the pakoda-selling job, which is a good thing," the CM jibed.
 
 Later in the assembly, health minister   lost no time in taking a swipe at the Congress by saying that his department would get the quality of pakodas examined.
 
 The Congress lawmakers, led by Kiran Choudhary, were offering pakodas to passersby before going to the state assembly as a protest against PM Modi's remarks likening selling pakodas to being employed. 
 
 Holding the 'pakoras' in a basket, the Congress legislators tried to march towards the Assembly but they were stopped by the police.
 
 The opposition party MLAs present on the occasion also included senior leaders Karan Singh Dalal, Kuldeep Sharma, Geeta Bhukkal and Shakuntala Khatak.
 
 "The Centre and Haryana governments had promised to create large number of jobs for the unemployed. But now they are assuring 'pakoda jobs' to millions of people looking for work. For BJP leaders, even people earning Rs 200 a day selling 'pakoras' can be considered unemployed, which is a cruel joke," Dalal told reporters.
