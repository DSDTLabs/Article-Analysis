CHANDIGARH: A 40-year-old woman who was in coma for more than 14 months after a car rammed her in a hit-and-run died on Thursday night, in a case in which the police gave up on catching the accused.

 Police had asked Sector 29 resident Gajpal Singh  , the husband of victim  , to sign an “untraced report” in December last year, which he refused. “There is no value of human life in the city. Police carried out a shoddy investigation. Lack of CCTV cameras on roads and unwillingness of cops to find the driver hampered the case,” he said.
 
 A white-colour car had hit Bina, 40, while she was crossing the road after buying household items with her daughter near the light point of sectors 29 and 30 on December 16, 2016.
 
 Rawat said there was no change in the status of the case since the accident. However, Industrial Area police stations house officer and investigation officer had been changed. After TOI had highlighted the condition of   in December last year, then SHO and investigating officer approached her and took details from Rawat but nothing happened.
 
 Rawat said, “I saw my wife dying every minute. It was very painful to see her like this. Now, all her pain and misery has come to an end with her death.”
 
 On the other hand, Industrial Area police said they investigated the case but there were no eyewitnesses and no CCTV footage of the accident.
