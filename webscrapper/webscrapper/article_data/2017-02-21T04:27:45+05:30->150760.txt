SURAT: The Khedut Samaj Gujarat (KSG) has threatened to intensify the agitation for thousands of people in over 12 coastal villages in   taluka, living under fear of flash floods and huge losses to their standing crops following construction of illegal shrimp ponds on the government land.

 KSG leaders on Monday submitted a memorandum to district collector demanding stringent action against the miscreants involved in the illegal construction of shrimp ponds on the government land.   said villages like  , Mor, Delasa, Mandroi, Karanj, Nas, Saras, Koba, Lavacha, Kudiyana to name a few are worst affected due to illegal shrimp ponds. The ponds are constructed close to the coastal border, leaving no space for the rain water to flow into the sea. This results in huge amount of flash floods in the villages, which may destroy the standing crops and damage houses. 
 
 Sources said that one Smit   has captured around 800 bigha government land at Dandi village and developed over a thousand shrimp ponds. The farmers have been fighting since last four years, but the government agencies are yet to take action. 
 
 Leaders of KSG, Darshan Nayak alleged, “Illegal shrimp farms will one day flood dozens of villages in Olpaad taluka. Farmers and villagers are living under fear wh-en the monsoon approaches. The shrimp pond owners are keeping goons to silence the voice of the villagers. They (pond owners) are indulging in electricity thefts, drawing water from the drain lines.”
