NAVI MUMBAI:   in the city are joining the efforts by animal lovers and activists to protect stray dogs by offering remedies at affordable costs to people who bring in   to be treated.

 Now that vaccinations and anti-rabies shots can be procured at an affordable cost, vets and animal lovers are hoping that incidences of pups contracting diseases will reduce. 
 
 This will also help monitor the stray dogs’ health in designated areas.
 
 Kharghar-based Dr   said that with so many strays around, he wanted to do something to help them against contracting an infection.
 
  “I provide anti-rabies vaccination free of cost and charge Rs 250 for the gastro 9/1 Pfizer vaccination which would otherwise cost between Rs 600 to Rs 1,000,” he said.
 
 Word about his service has spread and he now has a sizeable number of animal lovers bringing in strays or pets to be treated. “These vaccinations are very handy to prevent diseases in dogs and cats, especially if they are young and susceptible,” he added.
 
 Even Dr Shivaji Talekar from New Hope Animal Hospital,   said that they provide anti-rabies vaccination for free. “We often send an ambulance if anyone is not able to bring the animal to us, get it vaccinated and take it back,” he said.
 
 Dr Talekar added that school and college students often bring in animals and he finds this trend encouraging. “We are happy that youngsters are motivated to care for strays,” he added.
 
 Another vet, who runs a clinic in Vashi, Dr D K Patil also said that he offers a concessional rate for strays brought in for treatment.
