When BT asked   about working with   on projects in quick succession and why she isn’t part of her buddy’s comic outing, '  2', she said, “I don’t know why I am not there but we have our films together. I clearly can’t do every film with Varun although he’s a great friend. A break is needed. Whenever we get back after that, there’s a renewed energy at work.”
