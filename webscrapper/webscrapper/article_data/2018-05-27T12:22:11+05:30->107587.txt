INDORE: A video in which two girls were seen thrashing a man accompanying a policeman using their footwear in front of   temple in   area went viral on social media on Saturday. 

 The girls were allegedly harassed by the middle-aged man who was accompanying a cop on a bike. He passed comments and harassed the girls when they were coming out of the temple. The furious girls shouted at the man and followed him across the road where they stopped him and used 'chappals' to thrash him. One of the girls was seen repeatedly slapping the man with the support of some passersby who had stopped their vehicles to help the distressed girls. The cop accompanying the accused helplessly returned to roadside and became a mute spectator to the entire event. 
 
 It was only after the intervention of the locals that girl allowed the man to go. He apologized to the girl by holding his ears. 
 
 Although the girls did not approach police with the complaint, the police officials said that they will identify the cop who was involved in the case.
 
 Annapurna police refused to identify the cop in the video saying that he was not from their police station. 
 
 "I did not receive any complaint in the matter from the girls. The incident took place at Ranjeet Hanuman temple late on Friday night. However, the cops are not from Annapurna police station," said BL Mandloi, Annapurna police station in-charge.
