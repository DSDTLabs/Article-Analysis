AHMEDABAD: Chaos broke out in the general board meeting of the   when a   councillor alleged that a former mayor, Amit Shah, was making unwanted comments to stop the Congress from raising issues.

  The councillor had entered the hall with a bottle of muddy water. The Congress wanted to discuss the supply of polluted water. During the discussion, Jamalpur councillor   also brought up the lack of funds for the community hall in his area. He said that the   was deliberately not allocating funds. Amit Shah responded to this comment. And as Shah was speaking, Shaikh accused him of creating a ruckus continually to disrupt the Congress’ attempt to speak for the public. Shaikh said that Shah had a doctorate in disturbing the board. This made BJP councillors shout slogans and demand that Shaikh apologize. The Congress too started shouting slogans. Councillors from both parties rushed to mayor Gautam Shah’s chair. The board was adjourned shortly.
