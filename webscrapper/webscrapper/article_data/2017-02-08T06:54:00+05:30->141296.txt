Nagpur: “The constructive life Vijayrao Deshmukh, also known as Sadgurudas Maharaj, led is the manifestation of the virtues he has. He understood life well and the way he lived, we only can bow before him,” said Jitendranath Maharaj of Anjangaon Surji. Jitendranath Maharaj was speaking at the public reception organized by Chhatrapati Seva Pratishthan to mark his 75th birthday at Laxmi Nagar volleyball ground on Tuesday. Noted historian Babasaheb Purandare felicitated Deshmukh for his contribution to society.  Music composer Hridaynath Mangeshkar, former RSS spokesman Baburao Vaidya, chairman of the reception committee Vivek Ghalsasi and convener Avinash Deshpande were the chief guests. Jitendranath Maharaj said, “In honouring maharaj, we feel honoured. Living in this materialistic world, Sadgurudas Maharaj always looked beyond.”  Purandare said that for most of his works, a major part of contribution belongs to Deshmukh and one cannot measure Deshmukh’s personality with a scale. Mangeshkar expressed his feelings for Deshmukh through two abhangs of sant Dnyaneshwar. “Deshmukh chose Shivaji’s life and made it the base for all his works. Whoever has come in contact with him has got flowers of knowledge,” he said.  Replying to the felicitation, Deshmukh shared his thoughts and narrated several phases of his life. “I had many turning points in life. But whatever I have done, I never expected any appreciation or honour in return. My life is complete because of God’s grace,” he said. The event started with dhol tasha performance by Shivmudra Pratishthan, followed by lighting of the traditional lamp. Students of Keshav Nagar Vidyalaya presented ‘Punyashlok Shivrupa.’ A short video on Deshmukh’s life was shown. A book titled ‘Shiv Gangaugh,’ written by Pradnya Fadnis, was also released at the event.
