PUNE:   from the state are planning an indefinite strike from June 1 to draw the government’s attention to their problems. Farmer groups from Aurangabad and Ahmednagar are holding meetings to seek support from their counterparts in other parts of the state.

 The farmers’ demands include loan waiver, free electricity, appropriate price for their produce, grant for irrigation and higher price for milk. The agitation will not involve any political party or leaders.
 
 Once the strike begins, farmers have decided to produce only for their own consumption and not for the market. They also plan to stop supply of food grains, cereals, fruits and milk to markets.
 
 “Gram sabhas will be held to pass a resolution announcing the agitation. The first gram sabha will be held on April 1 in Puntambe village in Ahmednagar district. Other villages will also be roped in,” said  , one of the farmers taking part in the agitation.
 
 “We decided to launch the agitation as the government is not sensitive to farmers’ issues. Farmers are committing suicides year after year and nobody is bothered. It is time to prove our worth,” he said.
 
 The   has said farmer suicides in the country rose by 42% between 2014 and 2015. Farmers in Maharashtra have faced two consecutive droughts and the recent unseasonal showers have damaged yield in parts of Marathwada. With 3,030 cases, Maharashtra recorded the highest number of farmer suicides in the country (37.8%).
 
 The proposed strike might snowball into a political controversy as opposition parties have launched a stir against the government demanding loan waiver to farmers.
