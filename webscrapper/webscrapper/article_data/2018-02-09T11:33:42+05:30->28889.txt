PANAJI: As the final arguments before the   Water Disputes Tribunal in Delhi commenced on Thursday, senior counsel Atmaram N S Nadkarni, appearing for the state of Goa, hit out at Karnataka on various issues, including hydrology and environment.

 Referring to the documents submitted by Karnataka, Nadkarni said that the diversion of Mhadei river waters to the Malaprabha basin is not for drinking water purposes, but entirely for irrigation.
 
 Nadkarni said that Karnataka’s witness had clearly stated in his affidavit that once the water is diverted to the Malaprapbha, it will be used for irrigation need.
 
 While pointing out to the evidence given by Goa’s witness, Chetan Pandit, with regards to the state’s water needs, Nadkarni said that there is no requirement of drinking water in Hubballi and Dharwad and that their requirement can be met through some other source.
