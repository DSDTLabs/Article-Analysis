 Rytasha Rathore, who plays Badho in the show celebrated her birthday on 6 January on the sets of her show. A chirpy young woman, Rytasha cut a yummy cake as cast and crew clapped on. Producer of the show   says, "Rytasha is a very talented actress and a very bright girl. We love her and her energy on the sets and wish her a very very happy year ahead."
Producer   says about the show's leading lady, "Rytasha is special to us and very close to our heart, so we surprised her with a cake and gifts. We celebrated her birthday on the set with whole cast and crew and prayed for her happiness and good health." 
 So, did the birthday girl gift herself anything? "Neither my family nor I believe in gifts, but last year I gifted myself an iPhone 6S. So that was quite cool. This birthday, I'm gifting myself a studio apartment, obviously on rent. 
 Wise beyond her years, Rytasha has realistic expectations from life. When asked what she wanted for herself in 2017, she says, "As far as expectations from 2017 are concerned, I have none. Because expectations are the reason why we end up unhappy most of the times!"
 Badho Bahu on &   produced is by Sunny Side Up (Dipti Kalwani) and Hum Tum Telefilms (Sushant Kumar,  ) is doing very well with loyal audience base.
