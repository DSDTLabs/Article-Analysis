New Delhi: Former liquor baron Vijay   alleged a witch hunt on Thursday after market regulator   barred him from the stock market and holding any position of a director in a listed company for “fraudulently” diverting funds (about Rs 1,881 crore) from   (USL) to other entities within the UB Group, including now-grounded   Airlines.

 In a series of tweets, Mallya said allegations of fund diversion out of USL were baseless. He said USL accounts were approved by top auditors, an eminent board of directors and shareholders. “CBI alleges diversion of funds OUT of Kingfisher Air. SEBI alleges diversion of funds from USL INTO Kingfisher Air. What joke is this?” Mallya said on micro-blogging site Twitter.
 
 “I am kind of getting used to these witchhunts coming from all directions with no legal basis whatsoever. Shows what govt machinery can do.”
 
 The markets regulator also directed USL to initiate action against the beleaguered liquor baron, who fled India to avoid arrest by investigative agencies, and UB Group companies to which funds were wrongfully diverted by him.
 
 Mallya is the chairman of   and United Breweries (Holdings). After the Sebi order, he will have to step down from these positions. Sebi also barred six other people, including Ashok Capoor and V K Rekhi, both former MDs of USL, from the market. Capoor has also been barred from directorship of a listed company.
 
 “For 30 years I built the world’s largest spirits company and India’s largest brewing company. Also launched the finest airline. This is what I get,” Mallya said in one his tweets. “Kingfisher was a great public utility service connecting India like never before. It was not my private toy.”
 
 Sebi has also instructed USL to report to it, within 21 days, about action taken against Mallya, Capoor and others. It also wants USL to take measures to recover about Rs 1,881 crore from Mallya and the companies to whom those funds were wrongly diverted.
