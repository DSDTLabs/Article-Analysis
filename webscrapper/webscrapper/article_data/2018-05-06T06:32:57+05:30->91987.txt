 SHO Indiranagar Mukul   reached the place and the priest was arrested. "We have registered a case against Das for illegally possessing firearms and threatening the villagers.

 Das, however, told reporters that some property dealers eyeing the ashram land were creating trouble by instigating villagers. He also claimed he was ready to pay the medical expenses of the man bitten by his dog.
