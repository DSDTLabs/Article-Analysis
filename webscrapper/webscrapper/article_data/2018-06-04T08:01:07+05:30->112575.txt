KOCHI:  , the 22-year-old   of Abhayaranyam elephant training and rescue centre at  , will be shifted to Muthanga wildlife sanctuary on Monday amid protest by residents. 

 
 Neelakantan, who came to   when he was six months, will be trained as a ‘kumki’ elephant (captive elephants trained to tame wild ones). But for people living near Kodanand, the elephant is a part of their lives.
 
 Many fear that without Neelakantan, one of the healthiest and best-looking elephant in the centre, the tourist attraction would come down.
 
 “Neelakantan is the only reason why tourists pay the entry fee willingly,” said M S Sukumaran, coordinator of the Janakeeya Samithi.
 
 Now, residents have started protest against the decision to shift Neelakantan. 
 
 “He was raised amongst us. It is not easy to see him being transferred,” said Sujith K S, a resident of Kodanad and an animal lover.
 
 “Elephants are subjected to torture during ‘kumki’ training. They suffer severe injuries both externally and internally. Kerala has not had a proper ‘kumki’ elephant for the past 45 years,” said V K Venkitachalam, secretary of  .
 
 “Currently, we don’t have a ‘kumki’ elephant. Usually, we seek help from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for trained elephants,” said Anisha Siddhik, range forest officer. 
 
 Siddhik said that she understood the sentiments of residents but stressed on the need for a ‘kumki’ elephant.
