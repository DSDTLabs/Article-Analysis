AHMEDABAD: A Railway Protection Force ( ) team apprehended two persons with 9kg of   (hashish) at the Kankaria   on Friday evening. The duo was later handed over to the   Control Bureau (NCB).

 NCB officials said the two men — Ramraj Maurya, 33, and Hanuman Maurya, 25 — are natives of Gonda in UP and were caught on the Gorakhpur-Okha Express at 7pm. The duo was seen by a team when they did not disembark from the train even at the railway yard. Finding their behaviour suspicious, the RPF team checked their belongings and found nine packets of contraband.
 
 “We have got the details of the sender and the inteded receiver and further investigation is under way. The duo claims this was their first trip carrying contraband but we are checking their backgrounds. The hashish is of high quality and is possibly of Jammu & Kashmir origin. We learned that the two were promised Rs 10,000 each on successful delivery of the packets to a person who was to meet them in the city,” said an NCB official.
 
 NCB officials said that as the major routes known drug trafficking are being watched constantly, the senders have changed their modus operandi and are sending smaller quantities by rail. The duo were travelling in the general compartment to mingle with other passengers, they added.
