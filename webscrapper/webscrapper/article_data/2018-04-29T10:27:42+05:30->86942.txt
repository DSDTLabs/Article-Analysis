MOHALI: Abandoned tubewells are becoming hideouts of miscreants and drug addicts in  , prompting deputy commissioner Gurpreet Kaur   to write a letter to SSP   to conduct regular checks at such sites.

 There are around 52 abandoned tubewells in the district falling under the jurisdiction of municipal corporation,   ( ), public health department and Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation.
 
 Sapra said she had sent the letter keeping in mind the security of residents. The DC said she found illegal activity being carried out at an abandoned tubewell in Industrial Area while returning from a function at night a few days back. She said she spotted five to six men inside the tubewell. When she asked her security officers to take a look, all of them fled. The officers informed the DC that the men seemed to be drug addicts. Sapra said, “I will also ask Gmada, MC and public health department to check tubewells falling under their jurisdiction and seal them so that they may not be misused.”
 
 One of the tubewell operators told TOI, “We are scared to lodge complaints against people misusing abandoned tubewells. Illegal activities are being undertaken there.”
