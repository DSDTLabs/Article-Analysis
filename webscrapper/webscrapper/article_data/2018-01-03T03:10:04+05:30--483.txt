NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has allowed AAP   BS Joon to attend house meetings of South Delhi Municipal Corporation after he was   from the house along with seven   councillors and four aldermen for creating ruckus and disrupting the proceedings. However, the suspension continues for rest of the AAP members, which includes leader of opposition Ramesh Matiala.

  mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat had suspended seven AAP councillors and five nominated members on December 20 for creating ruckus in the house meeting and allegedly misbehaving with female officials. Joon had filed a petition in the high court challenging the mayor’s decision for suspension of the members.
 
 The high court, after hearing the case, directed Joon to file an undertaking that “he will not disturb the house proceedings of corporation or create ruckus or disorderly conduct,” and issued notice to the civic body to file an affidavit whether it had initiated any action against Joon as per the provisions of Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act.
 
 “Nominated member BS Joon will be allowed to attend the house meeting which is to be held on January 3. The suspension is valid til January 4 for the rest of the members including leader of opposition Ramesh Matiala. There was no need to move court, members should have submitted an undertaking in the house for their behavior,” said Sehrawat.
 
 She further added, “The members were suspended only after they misbehaved with female staffs in the well of house. This cannot be tolerated and we had issued suspension as per the DMC Act.”
 
 Congress leader and local councillor Abhishek Dutt reacting to the court order said, “We welcome the court decision and it should be an eye opener for local councillors, who feel that by creating ruckus they can disrupt the house meetings. There are so many issues which are not discussed during the house meeting due to continuous disruption by AAP members.”
