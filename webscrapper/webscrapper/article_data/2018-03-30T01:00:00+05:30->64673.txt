 was the first to tell you all about acclaimed British filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s four-day Mumbai itinerary and the wait is finally over. He and renowned visual artist   arrived in the city yesterday afternoon. Unlike most high-profile celebs, the two made a quiet, general exit without taking the VIP route at the Mumbai airport. Nolan, accompanied by his film producer wife   and children Magnus, Flora, Rory and Oliver, then headed to a SoBo five-star, where they will stay for the next two days.

 We hear a private dinner in the filmmaker’s honour will be hosted tonight at the hotel. Along with corporate hotshots, noted names from the film industry are also likely to attend the do. A source revealed, “Ranbir Kapoor, Kamal Haasan and AR Rahman will attend the dinner, which will be a private and informal bash of sorts.”
 
  For those unaware, Tacita and Nolan along with filmmaker, archivist and founder of the  , Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, will present ‘Reframing The Future Of Film’, an initiative that supports the cause of film preservation and restoration, during their stay here. Other than speaking about his passion for preserving the photochemical film in the digital age, Nolan will also present his films — Dunkirk in its IMAX 70mm format (just the way he intended it to be seen) and Interstellar in 35mm, for the first time in India on Saturday. A private round table with the Indian cinema’s bigwigs has been scheduled earlier on Saturday. Let the games begin!
