ROHTAK: Local MP   said here on Tuesday that the ‘Jan Kranti Rath Yatra’ kicked off by his father and former chief minister   from   in Faridabad would continue unhindered throughout the state.

 Addressing mediapersons here after attending an event of the Rohtak district bar association, Deepender said his father had started touring the state with the support of public and has been receiving their support from the first day of the march. “The INLD’s Hisar MP, Dushyant Chautala, had even gone on to misinform that my father was not taking out the ‘rath yatra’ under pressure due to the CBI cases,” he said, adding that the fact of the matter was that his father was injured.
 
 “It’s a fight of the people and I welcome all political parties to come and join us in this. In our 10 years of rule, we established   (IIM), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and universities in the state. The BJP should tell what did it do in the last four years for the people,” he added.
 
 Deepinder targeted the ruling BJP by alleging that the agrarian state had been slipping on all parameters while it had been on the top when the Congress government was in power in Haryana. Training guns at BJP MPs, he claimed that no other MP from Haryana dared to express themselves in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as they were permitted to open their mouth only to praise him.
