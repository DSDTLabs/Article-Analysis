Vijayawada: Mayor Koneru Sridhar opened the renovated   crematorium at Swargapuri Burial grounds in city on Saturday. 

 The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) shelled out Rs 86 lakh to revamp the old   and also developed greenery there. 
 
 Koneru Sridhar said, “People had to pay much for funerals as the electric crematorium was left aside for over 10 years. We renovated the old building and replaced the chimney, furnace, panel boards and generators.” 
 
 However, the age old practice of burning dead bodies on pyres and gas crematorium will also be available in the city for nominal charges, added the mayor. 
 
 The VMC chief J Nivas said this is the most sacred service done by VMC to make cremations free for poor people. Services like freezer boxes to preserve bodies and special lockers for ashes are available at Swarga Puri too. 
 
 He said that the electric crematorium is being used to burn orphaned bodies, apart from the poor. Unlike other cemeteries where the atmosphere all around is gloomy, VMC has developed a garden and put up wall paintings there. 
 
 After revamping the furnace, it takes 45 minutes to complete a cremation and hand over ashes to the kins of a deceased, Nivas said. Besides, civic authorities restored a free ‘Mahaprasthanam’ vehicle service for funeral processions. “We are keen on renovating other burial grounds in the city and works will start soon,” added Nivas. 
 
 The VMC chief medical and health officer CH. Babu Srinivas, deputy mayor G. Ramana Rao and others were present at the inauguration of the electric crematorium.
