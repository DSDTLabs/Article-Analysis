Our colleague, our friend went through a horrific experience, but she didn’t shy away, she didn’t hide. Instead, she has made all of you run into hiding, and run for your lives. We all stand with her, and with this strength and the timely action of the police and authorities, we are sure the gang will be arrested soon.
