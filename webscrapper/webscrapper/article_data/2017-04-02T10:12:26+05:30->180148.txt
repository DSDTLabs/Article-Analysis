ITANAGAR: China should refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of India, Union minister   said on Saturday after Beijing objected to the Dalai  's visit to   next week. 

 The Dalai Lama visits Arunachal between April 4 and 13.
 
  "We are not interfering in the internal matters of China and that country should not interfere into ours'," the minister of state for home affairs told reporters here. He said, the visit of the Dalai Lama was as per the wish of the people. 
 
 China had said on Sunday allowing Tibet's exiled leader to visit Arunachal will cause "serious damage" to bilateral ties and had asked New Delhi to make a "choice". 
 
 In its second warning in a month, the Chinese foreign ministry had said it was concerned about India's decision to allow the visit.
