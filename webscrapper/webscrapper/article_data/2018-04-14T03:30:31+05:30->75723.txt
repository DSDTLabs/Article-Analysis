NEW DELHI:   would   outside the residence of Prime Minister   on Sunday to urge him to speak on the Kathua and Unnao rapes. 

 Questioning the PM’s “silence” on the issue, AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said at a press conference on Friday, “The   is silent even though the   and murder accused of Kathua and Unnao are roaming free. It has become the PM’s style to be silent whenever there is a crisis in the country. When Dalits were targeted, the PM was silent.” 
 
 Rai pointed out that in both Jammu and Kashmir and UP, where the two rape cases occurred, BJP is in power. “The country cannot remain a mute spectator to what is going on,” he said. 
 
 Rai said that the protest at the PM’s residence will be the beginning of an agitation by AAP on the issue of women’s security. The agitation will spill over to other parts of the country as AAP volunteers of different states have been asked to raise the issue.
 
 Hitting out at the PM, Rai said, “When violence against women was on the rise during the UPA government, the entire country was disturbed. At that time, BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi had come out with a slogan promising to protect women. Now it appears that he has forgotten his promise because the people accused of violence against women are roaming free.”
 
 AAP has demanded strict action.
