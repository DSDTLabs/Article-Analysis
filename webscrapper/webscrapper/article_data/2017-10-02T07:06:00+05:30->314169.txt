GHAZIABAD: They step up one by one from among a congregation in a courtyard, raise their guns, and fire. Some once, some twice. Another comes up, points a revolver skyward and empties the barrel. Most are holding what seem like rifles. Among them are women who also pull the trigger.

 A disturbing video of this armed congregation, purportedly on the premises of Dasna Devi temple in  , was widely circulated on Sunday, leading to a case being filed by the police under the Arms Act against 50 unknown persons. The video is believed to have been shot on Saturday during a ‘shastra pujan’ (a weapons ceremony). Deducing from the video, police said 75 rounds appear to have been fired.
 
 The chief priest of the temple, Mahant Yeti Narasimha Saraswati, admitted the video was shot on Saturday but defended the firing, saying it was a practice that had been going on for 12 years on Dussehra. “The practice of firing from licensed firearms by devotees of   temple after ‘shastra pujan’ has been going on for 12 years and we have never had problems in the past. This year is the first time a case has been registered against devotees,” said Saraswati. “This is an attempt to interfere with a religious practice and I condemn it,” he added.
 
 Satyender Prakash Singh, SHO of   police station, said, “An FIR under section 30 of the Arms Act has been registered against unknown persons. We are now verifying the authenticity of the video, which shows about 50 odd people firing shots in the air. As per the video, more than 75 rounds were fired between 11am and late evening. After ascertaining their identities, action will be initiated against them.”
 
 The temple is located in a minority-dominated area, and successive priests have been known to make inflammatory speeches there. 
 
 Such incidents have raised communal tension in the region, local residents said.
