PUNE: In 2013, Nitin   lost his   card on a flight. The last five years have been a struggle — Amraotkar has visited numerous enrollment centres, in Pune as well as in Mumbai, and has even written to the   (UIDAI) officials — but there is no solution in sight for his very specific problem.

 First, he tried to retrieve his Aadhaar number but failed. he had approached the Aadhaar updating centres to retrieve his number, but the operators could not find his number in the database. After several attempts, he was told to reapply for a new Aadhaar number. Last year, Amraotkar tried that as well. 
 
 "I applied last year, but the application has been rejected due to ‘data processing error.’ I reapplied in December to again receive the same message,” he said. He has again applied and has got an enrollment ID, but he is not sure whether the same will be approved.
 
 Recently, the district administration officials asked him to approach the   office to either retrieve his Aadhaar number or to get help in re-registering for a new number.
 
 “The government has announced that Aadhaar will be linked with all the services, including banking services. A new deadline is awaited as per the SC directive. I am not sure I will be able to do anything unless someone from the UIDAI helps me retrieve my Aadhaar number or helps me register for a new one,” said Amraotkar.
 
 After changing his job, he has been unable to open a new bank account. Even his passport renewal is pending. All because Amraotkar does not have his Aadhaar card.
 
 In his letter to the IT minister and UIDAI officials, Amraotkar has requested for his issue to be addressed. “I have also called the helpline 1947, but it has been of no use,” he said.
