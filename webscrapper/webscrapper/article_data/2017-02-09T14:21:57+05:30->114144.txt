Around 165 young dancers from South Central Zone Cultural Centre, ( ) Nagpur, are all geared up to participate at the 68th Republic Day parade in Delhi. This time, they will present Madhya Pradesh’s tribal dance, Saila at Rajpath. As they leave for the capital today, we bring you all the details of their preparations for the R-Day performance… 

 
 Last year, city youngsters had performed Maharashtra’s   at the R-Day parade. In fact, PM Modi had even shared a picture of the performance on his social media accounts. Director of SCZCC Dr  , who is excited to watch these young stars perform this year as well, says, “The participants will reach Delhi tomorrow. They will be practicing at Rajpath, along with other performers from various parts of the country who will be there to present their respective dance forms.” 
 
 
  Saila which is a folk dance from Dindori (MP) is performed during the post-harvest season and participants are rigorously rehearsing to perfect their steps. But, what is interesting to note here is, they are being specially trained by the folk dancers of Dindori. Elaborating on the same, Dr Piush says, “We wanted to keep the authenticity and the essence of the folk dance intact. Though we have a choreographer from Mumbai who has choreographed the entire act and has worked on the coordination part, the folk artistes have taught the finer nuances of the tribal dance form to the participants.”
 
 
  Interestingly, the jewellery too has been picked up from Dindori for the performers. “While the costumes are being made in Mumbai, participants will don tribal jewellery like hasli, sikka mala and kardhani and feathered headgears during their performance made by the locals of Dindori,” informs Dr Piush and adds, “Instead of plain dancing, we have added a theatrical tinge to the entire sequence. Some of the dancers will be dressed as Ox and some of them will hold sticks and drums.”
