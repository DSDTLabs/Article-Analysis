GHAZIABAD: A school teacher was attacked by a miscreant with a sharp object when she resisted the   of her   chain in Sahibabad on Friday.

 The woman, Kiran Jain (35), is a resident of Shalimar Garden Extension and teaches at a government primary school. According to her husband, Manoj, Kiran had gone to the Mother Dairy outlet near their house with their 12-year-old daughter to buy milk, and was walking back home around 8.15pm when she was attacked.
 
 “The outlet is 300-400 metres from our house and when she entered our lane, she felt a hand on her shoulder. The moment she turned around, she felt somebody pulling the gold   on her neck, and it gave way,” Manoj said.
 
 When she grabbed her chain back and did not let go of it, the attacker scratched her face with a sharp object and fled. Kiran suffered injuries on her left cheek and was taken to a nearby clinic for a tetanus injection.
 
 Manoj said, “My wife did not see the attacker’s face but could only make out that he was wearing a cap and a red T-shirt. As soon as he snatched the chain, he hopped on to a motorcycle parked nearby, on which another man was waiting, and the duo sped away.” An FIR has been registered against the accused under Section 390 (loot) of IPC at the Sahibabad police station.
