PATNA: Apprehending violence, the state police headquarters put all the districts on   soon after the   raids on the residence of RJD chief   and his wife   on Friday.

 Sources said security personnel were rushed to the BJP and JD(U) state headquarters on Beerchand Patel Path around 6am before the CBI entered the 10, Circular Road residence of   family at around 7.30am. Later, security personnel were also deployed at the RJD headquarters on the same road.
 
 ADG (headquarters) SK Singhal said, “Suspecting political ramification of the raids, senior police officers of all the districts have been alerted to avoid any law and order problem.” He also said reserve police forces were also kept ready for deployment, if required.
 
 The ADG also said the districts police, especially in Patna, have been asked to intensify patrolling.
 
 State rapid action force and Patna district police personnel with riot control vehicles and water cannons were deployed around the BJP office to handle any untoward incident.
 
 The state government took the precautionary measures keeping in view the May 17 clash between RJD and BJP supporters in front of the latter’s office after the   department conducted countrywide search in benami property cases against Lalu’s family members. At least six BJP supporters were injured and several vehicles parked in front of the party office were damaged.
