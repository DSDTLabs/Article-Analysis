VISAKHAPATNAM: The four kilometre long approach road between Dolphin’s Nose to   is in a bad condition. It is not only riddled with potholes but also lacks proper lighting. Moreover, it lacks proper side walls and garbage remains strewn on the street. The condition of the road worsens during the rainy season.

 In spite of complaints and road accidents like that one that took place in June this year, when an officer of the Indian Navy died and his colleagues sustained serious injuries, the road has not been repaired.
 
 The AP State Road   has also been avoiding using the road. It currently operates one bus on the road in a day. 
 
 “It is the only route to go the Yarada beach. But the condition of the 4km-long approach road on the Dolphin’s Nose is atrocious and nothing has been done about it in the last one decade,” said P Shyam Chatterjee, a tourist from from Kolkata.
 
 Although the road is important to both tourists as well as to those residing in the residential quarters of the Indian Navy on the hill top, none of the concerned authorities such as the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) and   has shown any interest to develop the road.
 
 A senior tourism officials said, “We have been unable to extend better facilities to the tourists at the Yarada beach due to the lack of proper road connectivity. We could add new features at the beach front if there is a decent road connectivity with proper safety measures such as CCTV cameras and street lights on the ghat road.”
 
 Speaking to TOI, GVMC commissioner   said, “Yes, we have are also focusing on the issue of developing the ghat road on the Dolphin’s Nose going towards the Yarada beach. The roads have been inspected. We plan to develop the road in coordination with the tourism department. It is still in the planning stage.”
