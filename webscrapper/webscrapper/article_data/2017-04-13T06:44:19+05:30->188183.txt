KOLKATA: Within days of   alumni across the world protesting campus vigilantism,   vice-chancellor Suranjan Das on Wednesday sat with complainants and other stakeholders to condemn moral policing on campus.

 University registrar Pradip Ghosh said: “The VC held a meeting with the complainants and other stakeholders — teachers, students and non-teaching employees. We also sent a communication to the accused through the university website. But they didn’t turn up. All those present at the meeting condemned the reported act of campus vigilantism. If we get such complaints in future, we will take steps according to the law of the land.” 
 
 The VC’s response comes a week after he received a complaint from a few students who alleged they had been asked to “behave” because their actions were not in tune with Indian culture. 
 
 A second-year student of the Bengali department, Debraj Debnath, expressed his shock. “We have never heard of such an incident on our campus. It is an intrusion into our individual space. What worries us is how they could do that. Such activities, if unopposed, can lead to intimidation as well. We want the university to act tough against such people. The university authorities want to meet us once again.” 
 
 The teachers present, like   and  , also condemned the incident. “A university campus should be a free zone, which encourages free thinking,” Maity said.
 
 JU authorities, however, seized the opportunity to send out an alert on drinking and drug abuse on campus. The JU VC didn’t pass any directive though. Instead, he pointed to the penal provisions under law against drinking in public and sought suggestions from the students on ways to tackle the problem. 
 
 The VC also expressed concern over the unhindered entry of outsiders into the university. “The university is a public place. We can’t deny entry to outsiders. However, we are mulling reasonable restrictions on outsiders,” the registrar said.
