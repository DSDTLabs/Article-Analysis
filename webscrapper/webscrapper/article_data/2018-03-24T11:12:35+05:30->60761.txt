MOHALI: Bhartiya   president   has threatened to stop supply of milk, vegetables and fruits to Chandigarh and continue their protest till the Punjab government fulfills its promises. BKU activists blocked the entry-exit at the YPS crossing and threatened to sit on hunger strike if their demands are not met with. They had been occupying the spot overnight.

 Rajewal said, “If the state government does not give any relief to us and accept our demands by March 26, we will seize the supply of milk, vegetables and fruits to Chandigarh. Till then we will not move out.” Accompanied by around 300 activists, Rajewal said the chief minister   promised to waive off farm debts but put in some riders which we oppose. “The CM has only made announcements but has not delivered anything concrete at the ground level. The rate of milk has also been reduced by Rs 6 but it has affected the milk producers and Verka has reduced the purchase rate by Rs 6. We also demand that Punjab must rationalize the electricity rates at domestic levels in villages but government has instead increased it,” said Rajewal.
 
 
 The protest caused major traffic congestion as a result of which   residents had to suffer. The roads opposite YPS crossing, phase VII, VIII, IX, were blocked leading to traffic jams.
 
 Due to the protest, the entry-exit point of   was heavily guarded by cops closing down the traffic movement from all the four sides. This led to traffic mess on the main road running through Phase VII, VIII and IX with commuters having tough time to negotiate the traffic jams.
 
 BKU activists settling in the open spaces and green belts around YPS crossing, have set up a kitchen. They said that they have ample ration for days to spend here and enough supply in store.
