PANAJI: The   (DoE) on Thursday issued a circular reminding schools of the provisions of the  , which prohibits institutions from carrying out any screening procedure of students or charging capitation fees. DoE has warned schools of action, including withdrawal of grants, if they are found violating norms. However, the circular is likely to prove ineffective, with many schools charging parents unreasonable amounts under heads like ‘school development fees’, for which they often issue receipts that make the ‘fees’ seem legitimate.

 “It is brought to the notice of the undersigned that many schools resort to unfair means in the admission process which include advertising, the admission process, holding of screening test, interview of parents, etc.” states the circular signed by director of education GP Bhat. “It is mandatory for heads of the schools and the managements to refrain from such practices, failing which penal action including suspension of grants may be initiated. The managements and the heads are instructed to follow the guidelines issued by this directorate for the admission process.”
 
 Bhat also quoted Section 13 of the RTE Act, which states that any school or person that receives capitation fee will be punished with a fine extending upto ten times the capitation fee charged. And subjecting a child to screening procedure is punishable with a fine which may extend to Rs 25,000 for the first contravention and Rs 50,000 for each subsequent violation.
