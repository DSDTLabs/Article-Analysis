 Ahmednagar district collector Anil Kawde told TOI that villagers in the area had reported the tremors in the last fortnight.The administration is taking preventive measures and has decided to conduct workshops.
 
 Sangamner tehsildar Sahebrao Sonawane said officials from the Nashik-based   (MERI) will be conducting workshops for these villages as a precautionary measure.“We are taking all preventive measures as the people have told us that they had experienced tremors in 2006 as well,“ he said.
 
 MERI scientist Charulata Chaudhari had gone to some of the affected villages on a request from the Ahmednagar district administration. “These tremors appear to be an upper surface activity. This region receives such tremors quite often. It's too premature to say at this juncture if these tremors could lead to a major earthquake,“ she said.
 
 IMD seismologist M P Jadhav told TOI that the Thane belt, which covers this region, falls in seismic zones 2 and 3 which are moderately and mildly seismic areas. “The belt has not had a major earthquake in the last 200 years. It had recorded tremors way back in 1994, which were in the range of 2.3 to 2.4 on the Richter scale,“ he said.
