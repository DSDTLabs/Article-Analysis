The wedding reception of Nina Reddyâ€™s daughter,  , who got married to   in an awesome ceremony replete with all the rituals, was quite an affair. Movie stars, royalty, politicos and socialites mingled and posed, and went up the stage to greet and bless the newly married couple. 

 Amid all that rustle of Kanjivarams, glitter of diamonds and the jingling of bangles, stood out actress Jyotika, who kept it simple and yet elegant in a plain raw silk sari and statement jewellery. The event saw a scrumptious spread for dinner. And we spotted the mother of the bride, dressed in her signature style, and flaunting an amazing nose pin from her collection, playing the host to the hilt.
