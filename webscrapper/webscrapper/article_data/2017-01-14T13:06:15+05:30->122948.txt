PANAJI: Twenty-three-year old Avidipto Chakraborty, a final year student of  , Goa campus, is among 20 students from around the country to have topped the CAT 2016 examination with a 100 percentile score. Around 2.3 lakh applicants competed for admission to the prestigious   and other top business schools. 

 Chakraborty, a native of Kolkata, West Bengal, began preparations during his summer vacations in May 2016 and continued even when he was working 10 hours a day during his internship. “I answered mock tests over the weekend and used the nights to analyse my performance of the previous weekend,” says Chakraborty.
 
 The 86 mock tests of different difficulty levels that he answered prepared him for the “slightly tougher than average paper”. He answered 86 questions, focusing more on accuracy rather than number of attempts and this made all the difference, he says.
 
 Chakraborty, who listens to all types of music, plays the drums and recently participated in the Goa half marathon, didn’t let the tough questions in one section affect the way he answered the other two sections. “I didn’t panic when I found the logical reasoning section tough. I just kept my cool while answering the quantitative ability section after that,” he says. 
 
 The co-founder of Xinger, an online food-delivery service, Chakraborty has also been the chief coordinator of the department of sponsorship and management, a student body charged with raising funds for the finances of national-level student festivals on campus. 
 
 He is currently interning at   in Mumbai and has already landed a job as a business analyst at McKinsey and Co. He has plans to study at   and get into management consultancy. 
 
 His advice to others is “not to take the exam so seriously that the tension affects you while answering the paper. It’s also very important to be motivated and be around others who are also seriously preparing for the exam in the months leading to it”.
