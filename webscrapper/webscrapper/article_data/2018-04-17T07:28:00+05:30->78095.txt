Chandigarh: The Congress protested outside the office of the municipal corporation (MC) here on Monday to demand a rollback of the recent hike in parking charges in the city. 

 The   started before the MC House met for its monthly meeting and before councillors reached the office. Party leader and former MP Pawan Kumar Bansal described the hike as “massive and against the interests of people of Chandigarh”. 
 
 Bansal said the ruling party, BJP, had little regard for the problems of city residents. “People are being cheated in the name of smart parking. The people are upset, but BJP councillors are least concerned. Congress is not going to leave this issue,” Bansal said. 
 
 Carrying placards opposing the hike in parking charges, the protesters stayed put for a couple of hours. Other senior leaders of the party’s city unit also attended the protest.
