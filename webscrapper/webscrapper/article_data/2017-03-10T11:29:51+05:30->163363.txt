BATHINDA: Angry over the alleged police failure in solving the   of January 31, which claimed six lives,   town of Bathinda district held a protest on Thursday evening with black flags in hands.

They added that no one would celebrate Holi.

 Under the banner of   Struggle Committee, the residents marched through the markets and held a dharna at Mansa chowk. “Earlier too, we have held protests and handed over memorandums to the state government but the police are far from solving the case and arrest the guilty, who snatched six invaluable lives,” said panel member Naveen Kumar. 
 
 “We want a compensation of Rs 5 lakh per family given by the state government to be enhanced to Rs 1 crore each and a job and Rs 10 lakh each for those injured in the blast,” he maintained.
 
 Meanwhile, Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said that, “We are making all-out efforts to solve the case. Police teams are out at many places to arrest the guilty.”
