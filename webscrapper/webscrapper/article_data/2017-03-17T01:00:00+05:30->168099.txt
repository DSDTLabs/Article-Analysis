While he has managed to display his comic timing in the long-running saas-bahu drama ' ', not many know that   has also got a flair for mimicry. From singers   and   to actors like Jeevan,   and  , Nazim mimics them very well. The actor says, “I have always been a film buff, so mimicking came naturally to me. I started doing mimicry during my school days.”
Interestingly, Nazim’s first major lead role as Aham in 'Saathiya' was rather serious, but post the death of the character, he returned to the show as fun-loving Jaggi, where he gets to be more expressive and funny.
 Says Nazim, “Mimicry is a special talent; it’s not only about dressing and behaving like someone. The voice has to be accurate along with the attitude. I am happy that as Jaggi, I can show my hidden talent, which is my flair for comedy. I love watching comic films and I am waiting for that opportunity when I can incorporate my talent for mimicry as well.”
