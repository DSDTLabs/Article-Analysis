MUMBAI: In yet another  , a 65-year-old woman from Vadgaon in Nashik district, Sakhubai Zalte, consumed what is suspected to be cough syrup on the footpath opposite   on Friday. She was admitted at St George Hospital. 

 The recent spate of suicides brings to fore the need for medical intervention at the secretariat. Sources said had the   not been shifted out of Mantralaya after the 2012 fire, its medical officers would have handled emergency cases, like suicide bids. The dispensary is currently located behind Mantralaya.
 
  Dr S S Deshpande said, “We have written to the government seeking to move back into the Mantralaya. We could help handle emergency cases like suicide bids and provide first aid till the person is taken to hospital.”   Deepak Sawant said, “The government will try to accommodate the dispensary on Mantralaya premises as it would help to stabilize emergency patients.”
 
 Sources said at 5pm, Zalte reached Mantralaya to resolve a family land dispute, but before entering the premises, she consumed liquid from a cough syrup bottle. Cops near the gate took her to hospital in a taxi. St George medical superintendent Madhukar Gaikwad said her condition is stable, but she has been admitted to ICU for observation. “She has a history of ingesting cough syrup. We have collected her blood samples for tests.”
