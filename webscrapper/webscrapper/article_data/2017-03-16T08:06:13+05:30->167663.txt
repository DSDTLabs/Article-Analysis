KOCHI: It was a rough start for Class XII science students who appeared for the   examination this year, as the physics   on Wednesday proved to be a real tester.

 Sacred Heart School principal Father   said that out of five sets, one set was particularly challenging as students were unable to complete the paper in time.
 
 “The third set had a lot of analytical questions. So the students had to analyse the problems and because most of the paper was like that, students were unable to complete it on time,“ said   Durom, a physics teacher.
 
 Several students complained that they were unable to attend the later questions worth at least 10 marks as they had invested a lot of time attending the tricky “questions“. Salvin said, “There were around 20 marks direct questions, which made it difficult for the students who are weak in the subject to secure passing marks. The paper must not be full of direct questions but there should enough for students who is struggling with the subject to secure at least passing marks.“ He said that students must not dwell on this paper and must focus on the upcoming maths examination.
 
 Since physics was the second paper, the other being English, teachers are worried whether the physics exam might affect the students' motivation for the upcoming maths examination, which had been a difficult paper to attend for the past two years.
 
 Salvin suggested that the students must make use fourday interval between the examination and they must try completing at least one model paper against the clock, so that they can understand their weak points.
