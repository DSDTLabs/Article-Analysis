Chennai: Although the revised national tuberculosis control programme (RNTCP), Chennai, has 54 designated microscopy centres ( ) for quicker diagnosis and treatment of  , a majority of cases are detected only at 22 centres, researchers have found.

 Nearly one-sixth of these patients were from outside the city, indicating that those affected were part of the   the population and are among those who do not follow-up. "The patients are sent to the nearest TB units in the city where they get free medicines but not everyone made that visit. This could be one of the reasons we see missing cases of TB in the city. It also shows the need for better co-ordination between tertiary city DMCs and rural TB units," said NIRT scientist Beena Thomas. 
 
 Researchers found that more than 90% of smear-positive TB patients were diagnosed at just 22 diagnostic centres, and a majority came from tertiary centres — Government Thiruvatteeswarar Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (Otteri TB Hospital), the Institute of Thoracic Medicine, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. In May 2015, of the 3,543 people with symptoms of chest infections, 15.9% had addresses listed outside of Chennai. Of 412 patients diagnosed with smear-positive TB, 17.2% weren’t from city. 
 
 The team studied the reasons for the gap between the number of TB patients and those registered for treatment, and found that majority of the missing patients were from the city and many of them belonged to the lower income group. "There are many reasons why people don’t go for treatment, delay or dropout. Some postpone simply because they cannot afford to give up a day’s wage," said Thomas.
