CHENNAI: Whether Robert Payas and Jayakumar among the seven life convicts in the   will be among the 180 prisoners identified by the state government for early release to mark  , will be known on January 30.

 A division bench of the Madras high court has asked the government to verify if the two men, who filed habeas corpus petitions seeking early release and questioning their exclusion in earlier lists of beneficiaries, will be released.
 
 When the case came up for hearing before a division bench of Justice M Jayachandren and Justice T Mathivanan on Monday, additional public prosecutor said the government proposed to release 180 convicts on Republic Day. However, it had to be ascertained if the names of the two convicts were on the list, he said.
 
 The bench adjourned the case to January 30 for further proceedings.
 
 This is the first time in about seven years that Tamil Nadu has prepared a list of convicts for premature release. The last such occurrence was in September 2008 when the DMK government released 1,405 people who completed a minimum of seven years in jail. After it was questioned and PILs were filed, the practice was put on hold.
 
 Sources told TOI that the government had plans to release a set of prisoners to mark the birth centenary of AIADMK founder and former chief minister M G Ramachandran. They also said a fresh list of prisoners might be prepared for release from jail to mark the birth anniversary of former chief minister Jayalalithaa who died on December 5, 2016. Her birth anniversary falls on February 24.
