CHANDIGARH: Putting the week-long controversy over newly-sworn in minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s TV career to rest, Punjab advocate general on Thursday said the former cricketer can continue to work on his shows as there was   in his role in Capt Amarinder Singh’s cabinet.

 In his report, which was submitted to the Punjab chief minister, AG Atul Nanda has opined that the role and function of a celebrity judge is not an office of profit under both Centre and state subjects.
 
 “It is not even an office under any government,” he has pointed out. “Hence the continuation of such work would not invite the disqualification of holding of an office of profit within the meaning of Article 191 (1),” the report said.
 
 Sidhu has been in the eye of a storm ever since he assumed charge at Punjab civil secretariat, where he told media that “what he did from 7pm to 6am should not be anybody’s business”.
 
 After the report, Amarinder said there should not be “any hindrance now to Sidhu’s continuation on TV shows”.
 
 He also said that there would not be any need to change his culture portfolio. The AG was asked by Amarinder to offer his legal opinion on whether there was any prohibition or restriction in the continuation of Sidhu’s work as celebrity guest on a comedy show.
 
 Most Punjab ministers had rallied behind Sidhu, saying he was only earning his livelihood by doing the shows.
 
 “How does one live without adequate income,” asked Punjab power minister and MLA Rana Gurjit.
 
 Earlier Amarinder even said, “Do those opposing his TV shows want to make ministers corrupt by stopping them from earning their livelihood?”
