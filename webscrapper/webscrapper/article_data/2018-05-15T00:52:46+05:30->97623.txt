New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday declined to   a four-week   granted to former TV anchor and producer  , serving life term for killing his wife 18 years ago.

 He had been given the relief to attend to his ailing second wife.
 
 A bench of Justices S Muralidhar and I S Mehta refused to extend the bail and turned down the oral plea of Ilyasi’s lawyers after the court adjourned the hearing of his appeal against his conviction and sentence, to July 4. “No. There will be no extension. This is why we wanted to commence arguments today,” the court said. Ilyasi was granted bail on April 26.
 
 Ilyasi’s first wife Anju was rushed to a hospital on January 11, 2000 with stab wounds. She was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.
 
 Ilyasi, who had shot into limelight with the TV crime show  , was arrested on March 28, 2000.
 
 While deferring the matter, the court also frowned upon the conduct of the victim’s mother of writing a letter to the bench asking one of the judges to recuse from the matter.
 
 The bench adjourned the matter on a request made by Delhi Police that the hearing be deferred as senior advocate Sanjay Jain has been appointed as a Special Public Prosecutor to represent it. tnn
