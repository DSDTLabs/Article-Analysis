 Just a small tip: If you have windows or balconies in your home, facing east, wake up early enough to see the sun rise and the sky change colours. Feel the cool breeze on your face and have it run through your hair, or listen to the twittering birds, and just take in the greenery around you â€“ that experience will make you realise the beauty and wonder of nature. That would be the ideal way to start your morning. 
 
 The first thing I do every morning is drink 3-4 glasses of water. I have been doing this since I was 15 years old. I like to say this to young girls... I never had pimples because of this. I eat some fruit, preferably, papaya. Then I sit facing the morning sun and do all my stretches and yoga exercises. 
 Some breathing exercises and meditation too. Every alternate day, I do pilates. 
 
 Earth spins around the sun and never falls out of orbit because it spins on its axis, which remains steady. If we can steady ourselves in the morning, we can get aligned with ourselves. 
 
 Then we can manage all that comes our way later in the day. Not everything comes smoothly, but it helps in a huge way to have started the day in a positive manner. When I have my way, I do my morning regime and then I make it a point to read newspapers. I try my best not to focus on anything before I finish my morning exercises.
