CHANDIGARH: A man was arrested for hurling a shoe at chief minister   while he was addressing a public meeting in Rohtak on Sunday. The shoe missed its target. 

 The incident occurred when Kejriwal was speaking at the "Tijori Tod Bhanda Fod" rally against demonetisation during which he targeted PM  .
 
 The shoe-thrower has been identified as Vikas Kumar from Dadri in Bhiwani. He is a graduate and unemployed, a police official said.
 
 AAP workers and police in civilian clothes overpowered Vikas and handed him over to police at Urban Estate station. SHO Ramesh Kumar said the shoe fell some distance from the main stage. "He has been taken into custody. During interrogation he said he was hurt by Kejriwal's stand on the SYL issue, which went against Haryana's interests. Though we have not received any formal complaint from the organisers so far, he has been put under preventive arrest for breach of peace," the SHO said.
 
 Asked whether Kejriwal had been the target, AAP Haryana in-charge Navin Jaihind replied, "During questioning on the spot he (Vikas) claimed to have hurled the shoe to express his displeasure against demonetisation. It has nothing to do with Kejriwal ji or SYL."
 
 While attacking the PM on demonetisation, Kejriwal said the move had "made the common man stand in long queues for their own money". He added that "when the common man was standing in queues, the banks were writing off a bad debt of Rs 1,200 crore outstanding against now absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya".
 
 Delhi deputy chief minister  , who also addressed the rally, targeted Modi and criticised demonetisation, claiming it had failed to achieve its objectives.
