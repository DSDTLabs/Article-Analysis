CHENNAI: State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken suo motu cognisance of a media report about a patient's death at the government Stanley   two weeks ago, due to the alleged absence of a night duty doctor to attend to the patient. The commission has sought a detailed report within two weeks from the directorate of medical education (DME) in connection with the incident. In the event of any default, the commission may proceed to take action as it deems fit and proper, according to the notice from the office of   Judge  . 

 SHRC Judge D Jayachandran passed the order based on a report dated April 13 in a vernacular daily. 
 
 According to the report, Sampath, 32, a resident of Vyasarpadi, was admitted to the hospital on April 9 after he suffered a paralytic attack. He was treated in a ward on the fourth floor of the hospital. Meanwhile, on the night of April 11, Sampath developed health complications and frothed at the mouth. His wife, Manimekalai tried to contact the doctor on duty at that time, but no one was there in the ward, according to the media report.
 
 The report further quotes relatives of the victim alleging that doctors in other wards didn't turn up to attend to Sampath despite Manimekalai's requests. Meanwhile, Sampath breathed his last. On learning about his death, more than 50 people, including relatives of the victim, turned up outside the Stanely hospital and protested against the hospital management.
