BHOPAL: Three-time MP from Jabalpur constituency Rakesh Singh was once considered close to Union minister Uma Bhrati. He was first fielded from Jabalpur for the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, when   was routed everywhere else but secured 24 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh. Rakesh Singh subsequently retained his seat in 2009 and 2014. He was also the Jabalpur district BJP chief since 2000.

 Sources in the state BJP claim that Rakesh Singh’s actual name is Ghanshyam Singh. At least that was what he was known as during his student days at the   in Jabalpur. It is also well known in the state BJP that the newly appointed president is a distant nephew of transport and home minister Bhupendra Singh. 
 
 Rakesh Singh, though not a popular face in the state, is presently the chief whip for the party in the Lok Sabha. It is for this reason that he is known to be well-connected to Prime Minister   and BJP national president Amit Shah.
 
 His appointment as state BJP chief ensures there is no factional divide and orders from both the central leadership and chief minister   are implemented with no questions asked. Rakesh Singh also belongs to the OBC community and for the first time both chief minister and state unit chief are from OBC.
 
 With not much fan following in the state BJP, Rakesh Singh has his feet on the ground. In his own words, “I don’t believe that I can do everything alone. Team work is important and the energy of lakhs of party workers will help us reach the target in 2018 and 2019. Every BJP worker in each polling booth is Rakesh Singh. I don’t know what I can achieve but will leave no stone unturned.”
 
 Apart from winning   seat three consecutive times, Rakesh Singh’s achievement is also the establishment of the party in Bargi assembly seat. Chief minister Chouhan on Wednesday praised Rakesh Singh’s work as in-charge of the assembly seat which the party has been winning since 1998.
