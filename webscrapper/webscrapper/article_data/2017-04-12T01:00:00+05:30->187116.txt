Model   and actor  , who is currently seen in the TV show ' ', are all set to get engaged on the 21st of this month. An arranged match, the two met through a common friend in February and the rest, as they say, is history. 

 Siddhaanth, who has a 12-year-old daughter from his previous marriage, says, “A common friend, who knew that both of us wanted to settle down, orchestrated our meeting. I met Alesia with an open mind and we hit it off instantly. The first meeting was followed by a few more and everything fell in place. Now, it feels like we were destined to be together. Everything is happening fast and we have decided not to break the flow. We want things to materialise organically.”
 
 Siddhaanth says that he and Alesia are mirror images of each other. “There is a great deal of understanding, trust, faith and respect between us. We are at ease with each other. Both of us are parents and in the same profession, so we have a deeper understanding of the mechanism of this  . Many friends expressed their shock; ‘Itni jaldi ho gaya sab?’ they asked. Well, what can we say to that? For some people, it takes a lifetime to understand the other person, our case was different. We are both spiritually inclined as well,” he says. 
 
 Alesia, who has a 10-year-old son from her first marriage, adds, “I have finally met a guy who understands me and is on the same page. I have fallen in love again after 10 years. We had to be careful about taking our relationship ahead since we both are parents.”
 
 And what about the wedding? “We haven’t decided on a date yet. Our families have met and so have our kids. We are glad that our children have connected beautifully. All our initial fears have been put to rest. We plan to tie the knot by the end of this year or the beginning of 2018. We are taking it one day at a time,” Siddhaanth sums up.
