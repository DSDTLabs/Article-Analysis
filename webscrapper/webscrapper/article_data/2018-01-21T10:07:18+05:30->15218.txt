CHENNAI: In what is seen as an attempt to assert their authority over the ruling  , chief minister   and his deputy O Panneerselvam have continued their exercise of axing   loyalists from the party. 

 Days after suffering a humiliating defeat in RK Nagar bypoll, the two leaders on Saturday expelled nearly 400 party office-bearers in Thanjavur, the native town of V K Sasikala clan, on charges of anti-party activities and for bringing disrepute to the party. About 100 functionaries were expelled in Salem rural unit led by Palaniswami himself for violating party principles. 
 
 In a party release running to 20 pages, the leaders listed the names of functionaries, beginning with party agriculture wing secretary Durai Govindarajan, facing punitive action. 
 
 Govindarajan was elected MLA in 1977, when AIADMK contested elections for the first time. Incidentally, Govindarajan was one of the signatories of a resolution adopted by headquarters’ office-bearers against the appointment of T T V Dhinakaran as deputy general secretary in August. A week later, Govindarajn took part in Dhinakaran’s public meeting at Melur. 
 
 “The party has decided to sack the betrayers. The move will not have any impact on our district unit that has more than a lakh cadres,” former minister and Thanjavur East district unit secretary R   told TOI.
