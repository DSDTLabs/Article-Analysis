Deepika Padukone is the girl of the moment with her Hollywood debut ‘xXx: Return Of Xander Cage’ making waves upon its release across the world. And it’s not just her professional life that’s much talked-about. Her alleged relationship with Ranveer Singh too has always found itself under the spotlight. In an interview with Filmfare for its January issue, the actress opened up on matters of the heart.   Considering Deepika was globe-trotting for most of 2016 owing to the shoot and promotions of ‘xXx: Return Of Xander Cage’, she was asked for her views on long-distance relationships. Stating that she has “never dealt with a long-distance relationship”, the actress said that the relationship can be easy or complex depending on how the involved people deal with it.    The 31-year-old actress even spoke at length about marriage. She revealed that she has no plans to get hitched anytime soon. The ‘Padmavati’ actress further added that marriage has nothing to do with age but entirely depends on the person’s state of mind. Deepika also asserted that she is “not ready for marriage personally” at this stage in her life.
