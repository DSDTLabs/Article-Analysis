KOLKATA: Trinamool MP Tapas   may be released on Saturday after his bail formalities get over. He was granted bail on Friday in the   ponzi case following his arrest by   in December 2016.

 “We are through with the primary formalities here. Now, the family must arrange for the amount required for bail bond and surety,” said Siddhartha Das, the lawyer appearing for Paul at the  . Neither Paul’s wife Nandini nor daughter Sohini could be contacted for comments.
 
 “If the bail bond and surety can be arranged by Saturday morning, he can be released by afternoon. I am yet to get any call from the family members, but their lawyer is in touch with me,” Das said. 
 
 The condition of Krishnagar MP Paul, who is in a Bhubaneswar hospital, is still not stable. 
 
 Paul’s Tollywood colleague, Chiranjeet, now a Trinamool MLA, said: “I was shooting in Budge Budge the day he was arrested. I was shocked. Today, I am happy he has been granted bail.” Chiranjeet insisted his comments were not to be mistaken for the party’s stand on the issue. 
 
 Actor-turned-Trinamool MP Shatabdi Roy too was “very happy”.
