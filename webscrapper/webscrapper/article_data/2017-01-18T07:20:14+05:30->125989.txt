AHMEDABAD: Why did authorities shift H5N1-infected birds from Hathijan, on city outskirts, to densely populated Memnagar, at the centre of the city? A 96-year-old resident of Memnagar, Bhagwatiben Brahmbhatt raised the question before the Gujarat high court in a PIL, and on Tuesday, the bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice V M Pancholi asked the state government to file its affidavit in response by Friday.

 The bench termed the issue as “very serious” and asked the state government to explain on what logic it shifted the bird-flu infected birds to Memnagar, and why authorities did not take precautions to protect residents of the area.
 
 The petitioner has taken a strong stand against the decision of authorities to cull and   in the centre of the city, instead of disposing the carcasses outside urban area. She has accused the authorities of putting public health at risk, by acting irresponsibly and through inaction. 
 
 The PIL has alleged that authorities have remained inactive since the city police commissioner issued a circular under Section 144 of the CrPC declaring an area of 1-km radius from Memnagar’s public park as bird flu-affected zone, and a 10-km area as an alert zone. The petitioner has objected to authorities permitting schools and other education institutes to run in the affected zone and putting the lives of students at risk.
 
 The petitioner has also sought punitive action against officials who failed to safeguard public interest and decided to bring infected birds to a public garden in Memnagar from Hathijan, even after the birds were found infected with H5N1 virus.
