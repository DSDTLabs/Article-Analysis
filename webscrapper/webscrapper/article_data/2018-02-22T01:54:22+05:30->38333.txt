GURUGRAM: Residents of   in Sector 50 have filed a complaint with the senior town planner of  , requesting him to expedite canal water connection that the authorities had promised last year. Notably, 22 crore litres of groundwater was being drawn in the area through bore wells every year. 

 Residents said they have been living without an occupation certificate for the past eight years as the developer,  , is dithering from issuing the same, while the DTCP is dragging its feet and not pulling up the realtor. 
 
 Residents said without an OC, they can’t have neither legal canal water connection, nor sewer connections, as a result of which they are forced to draw water from borewell with annual extraction clocking around 22 crore litres. They also said that without OC, they are unable to insure their properties.
 
 Residents said they had a meeting with   in April last year during which officials had agreed to provide canal water connection in spite of no OCs out of concern for “greater environmental interest”.
 
 “Even if officials were to get ready to give connection as early as tomorrow, we are helpless because Unitech has not built the requisite infrastructure,” said  , RWA secretary, Fresco Apartments.
 
 STP Gurugram could not be contacted, despite repeated attempts.
