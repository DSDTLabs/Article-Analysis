KOLKATA: There were a number of previous allegations against  , the ashram at Salt Lake’s CL-249 where the   police station officers conducted a raid on Saturday and rescued 15 women aged between 25 and 60 years. Apart from the police, the state women and child development and social welfare department has also started a probe into the allegations. The women’s commission is also looking into it.

 One woman, who was detained, was arrested late on Saturday night. She has been remanded in police custody. The other two who were detained were allowed to leave after questioning. The police will further interrogate the arrested to know more about the alleged irregularities at the ashram.
 
 Police said all the rescued women have been sent to a state-run home.
 
 According to a source,  , the owner of the house where the ashram has come up, had informed the state women and child development department that some illegal activities were going on inside the ashram without his knowledge.
 
 A few days ago, a team from the state department that had visited the place for inspection was allegedly not allowed to step inside the ashram.
 
 State women & child development and social welfare department minister (independent charge)   said the ashram has now been sealed and that they have taken cognizance of the complaints. “There was a complaint against the ashram two years ago. We are strictly keeping an eye on the ashram and a search is on to nab those who have gone missing,” she said.
 
 Locals said there was always something fishy about the ashram, with nobody quite sure what exactly was happening there. “There were also allegations of trafficking against the ashram,” alocal said. “All the windows of the ashram always remain shut,” another local said.
 
 In a similar raid at the ashram a few years ago, a minor girl was rescued following complaints from the locals. The ashram authorities could not produce valid documents at that time.
