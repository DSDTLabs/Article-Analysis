 Vikram, whose sister is 2012 Punjab cadre officer Surbhi Malik, said his first preference is IAS. Megha Arora, the daughter of Punjab DGP Suresh Arora, bagged the 108th rank. The 26-year-old made it in her third attempt. She was not satisfied with her previous performances for her first preference (IFS).

 Shruti Arora, the daughter of Keshni Anand Arora, additional chief secretary, Haryana, secured the 118th rank in her third attempt. “I think I have to go for my second preference, which is IPS, as my rank will not make me eligible for the IAS,” said Shruti.
