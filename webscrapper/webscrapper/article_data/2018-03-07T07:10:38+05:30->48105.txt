DHAKA: An Islamic seminary in   has burnt hundreds of mobiles seized from students claiming that they were getting distracted by it, according to a media report.

 The superintendent of the Hathazari Barha   said on Monday resident students are not allowed to use mobiles, media reported. “We seize mobile phones, especially the ones that play music and videos, from the resident students during admission every year,” he said. He did not specify whether the mobiles were destroyed. Some students said authorities burnt around 400 mobiles on Sunday, media said.
 
 The seminary was not against technology but the negatives of   that far outweigh positives, a spokesman for the madrassa said.
