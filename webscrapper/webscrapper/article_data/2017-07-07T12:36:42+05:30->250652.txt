The anticipation for   and   Sukumaran’s movie   had been building since the movie's first poster was released earlier this year. With both the actors along with the scriptwriter promising a one-of-a-kind experience, Tiyaan has been on the ‘must watch’ list of many.

 The movie itself is close to 2 hours and 48 minutes long, and after the end of first half - it has all the intensity that   films are known for.
 
 The film revolves around a village, situated a few hundred kilometres from Badrinath, named Shankar Ghat that is inhabited by a secular crowd. Pattabhiramagiri (Indrajith) and his ancestors have been living in the land for generations. However, with a godman named Mahashey (Murali Gopy) wanting to build his ashram at the village, the lives of Pattabhiramagiri and the villagers come under threat. How 'curses’ befall Giri due to his opposing stand complete the first half.
 
 The initial half belongs completely to Indrajith as the actor brings his A game displaying wisdom, anger, sorrow and intensity with ease. The highlights are the dialogues - in Hindi, Malayalam and Sanskrit.
 
 Prithviraj appears as a mysterious saviour who eggs on Pattabhiramagiri's character in his fight for good, but his character's intentions and back story are yet to be revealed.
 
 The second half is beautifully composed after an intense encounter between Mahashey and Pattabhiramagiri. Reading between the lines, the film also throws light on India’s current social-political scenario. However, it's so well wrapped by the director   that it's hard not to be entertained.
