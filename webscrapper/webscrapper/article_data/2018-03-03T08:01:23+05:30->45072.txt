HYDERABAD: Telangana   will take up various programmes to counter the state government's allegations about the lack of Central assistance to Telangana. It has also been decided that Union ministers will frequently visit the state and publicize central schemes. 

 Union defence minister   held a meeting with state BJP leaders, MLAs and MLCs at the residence of former governor   on Friday. The issues discussed at the meet included strategies to be adopted to strengthen the party. The leaders also discussed recent remarks made against Prime Minister   by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.
 
 "Though KT Rama Rao clarified that the remarks against the PM by his father were a slip of the tongue,   should apologise and give an explanation," a senior BJP leader said.
 
 The Union minister felt though the Centre has been implementing various welfare schemes for people, people are not aware of these. She told the leaders that she would be coming to the state after the parliamentary session.
