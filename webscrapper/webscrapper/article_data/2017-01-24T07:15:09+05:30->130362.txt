NEW DELHI: Sticking to its successful experiment of the 2014   polls,   has given more than 30% of tickets for UP assembly polls to OBCs, who constitute the highest percentage of the state population.

 The party has named 104 OBCs among the 304 candidates declared so far and their representation is likely to increase as the remaining 99 seats are mostly in eastern UP, where BJP has groomed several   members.
 
 The saffron party had fielded 30 OBC candidates out of 80 in the 2014 general elections in the state and its reliance on non-Yadav castes was termed as a masterstroke of party president Amit Shah, who had finalised LS candidates in the state.
 
 Even its allies -Apna Dal and Suheldeo Bharat Samaj Party -are OBC-backed political fronts, whose kitty will help increase the number of non-Yadav candidates. It is be lieved the two par ties could get around 15-18 seats of the remaining 99.
 
 There have been reports of resent ment in non-Yadav OBCs who claim that they were denied opportunities in the   dispensa tion, which laid maximum fo cus on a single caste. BJP strategists hope to benefit from this.
 
 Although BJP has pledged to contest the polls on its de velopment agenda, highlighting the achievements of the   government including steps like demonetisation and surgical strikes across the LoC, Shah and his think-tank have bowed to caste loyalties, which remain the most decisive factor in the state. Even parties like SP and BSP have followed suit.
 
 BJP has named 65 Dalit candidates, the second highest bloc in the list of 304 declared so far. Interestingly, 58 Thakurs are the third highest group despite being only 8% of the state's population and the number is more than 46 Brahmins announced so far.
 
 However, senior party members played down caste as a factor in picking candidates and reiterated that development was their main poll plank.
