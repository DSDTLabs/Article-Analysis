NEW DELHI: A court has refused to set aside the punishment awarded to a bus   for endangering the lives of 10 passengers by negligently driving the vehicle.

 Additional Sessions Judge   dismissed the driver’s plea challenging a magisterial court order sentencing him to six months in jail for causing the accident in 2009, where passengers were seriously injured.
 
 The court relied on the testimonies of the passengers and said their statements — revealing that the driver did not slow down the   despite their request — were trustworthy and reliable. “Eyewitnesses of the incident/injured persons have supported the case of the prosecution on all material particulars...find them to be trustworthy and reliable witnesses. They have corroborated each other on material points and their testimonies have also remained unshattered and unshaken in their cross-examination,” the court held.
 
 While upholding the sentence awarded to convict  , the court also considered the mechanical inspection report of the bus, which concluded that it was being driver at high speed when it hit the tree. All public witnesses testified that the passengers received serious injuries and police was called and they were taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre, the court observed.
 
 The driver, however, denied the allegations and claimed he was falsely implicated.
