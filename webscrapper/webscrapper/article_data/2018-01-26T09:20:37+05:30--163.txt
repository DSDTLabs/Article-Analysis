NEW DELHI: The capital may see very dense fog on Friday morning, but the visibility is likely to improve from 8am onwards,  , Delhi stated. This would mean that the parade, which starts at 9am, may not be affected.

 But it may hamper the view of the breathtaking   by the Indian Air Force fighter jets, one of the key attractions. On Thursday, visibility at Palam fell to zero between 1.30am and 4am due to very dense fog, but it improved to around 100m till 8am. Even during the day, Palam and Safdarjung had improved visibility to only 1,200m. The   conditions are expected to remain similar on Friday. 
 
 “The visibility around India Gate is likely to be less than 200m early in the morning. But there will be a gradual improvement after 7.30-8am,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, director, regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC). There will not be much difference in temperature on Friday, but may witness a slight rise (by about 2 degrees) on Saturday and Sunday.
 
 Explaining the reason leading to dense fog Shrivastava said, “Rainfall on Wednesday in northwest India led to moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea and also there is light wind blowing in the morning. These two together make it conducive for formation of fog. Even in parts of Haryana and UP, visibility reduced to less than 25m in the morning. It may improve from Saturday.”
 
 There is a forecast for a western disturbance (WD) that may affect Jammu and Kashmir around Sunday and cause snowfall. Just before the WD, there will be a slight increase in temperature in the plains, following which it will be in the normal range, RWFC scientists said. The maximum and minimum temperature on Friday is likely to be 20 and 6 degrees Celsius, respectively. On Thursday, the maximum temperature was 4 degrees below normal at 18.4 degrees Celsius and minimum was 1 degree above normal at 6 degrees Celsius.
