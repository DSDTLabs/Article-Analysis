MANGALURU: “Those politicians of Congress, BJP and JD(S), who could not save  , need not come to seek votes here,” reads a board at the gate of an activist’s house. More and more such boards are coming up in cities and rural areas of Dakshina Kannada district.

 
 Sahyadri Sanchaya, National Environment Care Federation and other organisations opposed to river diversion projects have decided to question parties about their silence on the issue.
 
 The campaign is also aimed at opposing illegal sand mining, felling of trees, construction activities in the Western Ghats, encroachment of forest land, implementation of Yettinahole project and hunting of endangered animals. Greens will request voters to choose NOTA if there are no suitable candidates.
 
 “When election is nearing, political parties start their blame game. All political parties are in favour of diverting Nethravathi. In fact, they have been cheating the public and destroying the environment by not protecting the Western Ghats,” said Dinesh Holla of Sahyadri Sanchaya.
 
 NECF state secretary   said a campaign to protect the river would be started in the district soon after candidates are finalised. “We will request voters not to vote for candidates, who have not shown concern towards protection of Nethravathi river and Western Ghats,” he said.
