NEW DELHI: With the U-17 World Cup scheduled for October later this year, the news from the team front is not really encouraging. India's U-17 team, comprising the hopefuls to take part in the World Cup, has lost their fifth match on their exposure tour of Russia.

 The 1-0 loss to Tajikistan in the Granatkin Memorial Cup in Moscow on Friday ended a bleak spell of five losses for  's boys. They won one match against Belarus in the whole tournament. The tournament featured 16 teams from across the world. India finished last with only one win from five outings, according to the  .
 
 In the tournament, India lost to Russia, Latvia, Iran, Estonia and Tajikistan. The biggest margin of defeat (8-0) came against hosts Russia. The India U-17 team lost 1-0 to 10man Tajikistan in a 15-16th position play-off match. The team has been preparing from 2013 for the World Cup. Australian Scott O'Donnell initially helped in scouting, which was later taken on by national coach   and Nicholai Adam, the incumbent.
 
 The final loss to Tajikistan is a warning bell since India's record against the Central Asian boys has been good under Colm Toal. Adam's hopes of India making a mark and finding a place in the football map in the world with hosting the U-17 World Cup seem to be detached from ground reality.
