CHENNAI:The much needed   (FoB) in front of   is yet to be constructed, as tenders floated twice by CMRL failed to find a contractor. 

 Commuters heading to the station are still forced to cross the busy   or walk a few metres from the station to take a dimly lit subway. 
 
 Metro rail officials said they were not able to find a contractor as they were not satisfied with the deal suggested by companies that had applied. CMRL first floated tenders to build the foot over-bridge in late 2016 and later in early 2017. 
 
 The plan was get the facility in place before the end of this year. Companies that had applied asked for more time to meet the CMRLâ€™s specifications, metro officials said. 
 
 According to their tender invite, the company that takes up the contract would have to build the bridge with additional facilities like escalators and elevators for the convenience of pedestrians.
 
 Alandur metro station, which is an   connecting two corridors of phase-1 including the airport with the rest of the city, was opened along with the first 11km stretch in June 2015 between Koyambedu and Alandur. There have been several requests from commuters and pedestrians to construct a permanent foot over-bridge for easy access to either side of the road. 
 
 Without a foot overbridge, commuters are forced to cross the busy GST road by jumping over the centre median close to the landing of   Motorists also find it difficult to slow down for them when they drive down the flyover at break-neck speed. 
 
 The only other option is to walk a few metres away from the station to take the existing subway. While few passengers take the subway during the day, many hesitate to use it after dark.
