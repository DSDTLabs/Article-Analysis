MADURAI:   was observed at   at Udayadi in Kanyakumari district on Friday. Wildlife NGO, Tribal Foundation, Nagercoil, had organised the event for school children.

 Delivering the keynote address, environmental educator, S S Davidson said that tiger was a keystone species and its presence in a forest denoted the health, wealth and biodiversity richness of the forest. When tigers are found in a forest, it reveals that the predator versus the prey base is in a better status and that preys like deer, sambar, barking deer, gaur, mouse deer, monkey, hare, and wild boar exist in the forest with a rich biodiversity.
 
 In the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, the large cat species are spotted in government specified Tiger Reserves in Kalakkad, Mudumalai, Anamalai and Bandipur. In Kanyakumari wildlife sanctuary, tigers and leopards are spotted in the upper reaches of the forests, he said.
 
 Davidson said that the presence of tigers denoted the rich environmental heritage of our forests and the precious animal should be taken care of judiciously. Sadly tiger population was dwindling owing to a host of reasons such as forest destruction, encroachment, pressure on forest land in the peripheries and current drought conditions. 
 
 Creating proper awareness on conservation of forests, its fringes was the need of the hour and a holistic approach was also needed for the ecological conservation of forests and tigers, he added.
