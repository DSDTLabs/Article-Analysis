GURUGRAM: National Green Tribunal ( ) has issued a notice to  , Huda, Haryana government and the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) for exploitation of   by the amusement park.

 The notice was issued by the tribunal on Tuesday in the wake of a petition by RTI activist Harinder Dhingra, seeking direction to restrain Appu Ghar from using groundwater without necessary permission and constitute an expert committee to investigate the illegal extraction of groundwater resulting in depletion of the city’s water table. The next date of hearing is on July 31.
 
 Appu Ghar is spread over an area of 42 acres and it has an exclusive water park named as   spread over an area of 10 acres. It’s run by International Recreational Amusement Limited.
 
 Niti Saxena, president (sales & marketing), Appu Ghar, has denied exploting the city’s groundwater. “We use recycled water in Oysters water park. The water used is less than what is used in a five-star hotel,” said Saxena. “Our approach is to conserve water and use recycled water,” she added.
 
 However, Dhingra has alleged the amusement park is exploiting groundwater, despite fast depleting water table in the city. “Despite prohibition on exploitation of groundwater in the city, the amusement park is using groundwater and no action has been taken so far,” he added.
 
 Responding to Dhingra’s RTI query, Huda had in June 2016 said the amusement park had been sanctioned two water connections, one of size 50mm and the other one of size 25mm.
 
 CWGA has declared Gurgaon as a dark zone, and in 2011 prohibited installation of any new structure for extraction of groundwater without prior approval.
