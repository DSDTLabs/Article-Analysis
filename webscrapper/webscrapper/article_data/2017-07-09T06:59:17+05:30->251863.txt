CHENNAI:   Authority of India ( ) has procured 40baggage scanners to replace the standalone machines being used at domestic terminal and a few at international terminal to scan bags before they are checked in at the airline counters. This means domestic travellers will have to wait longer for inline baggage scanning system which eliminates the need for people to scan bags before checking them in.

 The new machines, which have reached the airport, will be used to replace the old machines that being used at the domestic terminal. Some of the machines are rented ones also. When the new domestic terminal was opened, the authorities shifted   used in the international terminal to the domestic because the inernational terminal already has the inline scanning system but a few standalone scanners are there to carry out random check of bags.
 
 A senior official of AAI said, “We will install these scanning machines in 15 to 20days. The scanning will be efficient and smoother at the domestic terminal because of the new machines.”
 
 The machines are kept on the bridge before the terminals awaiting transfer to the buildings.
 
 It would take many more months before inline baggage scanning system could be installed at the domestic terminal because tender process is yet to be completed.
 
 “Technical bid for the project is yet to be completed,” said an official. There has been a delay because   (BCAS) revised specifications needed for the inline system citing renewed security threats.
 
 Bags are put to multiple levels of scanning under inline system soon after they are checked in at airline counters. The inline machine automatically sorts bags if there is a suspicion.
