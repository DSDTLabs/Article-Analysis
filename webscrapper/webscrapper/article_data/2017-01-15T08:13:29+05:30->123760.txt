VARANASI: While most   took   and others enjoyed kite flying to celebrate   with religious fervour on Saturday, the city also witnessed a unique 'kichari ceremony' involving the members of outcast ' , Muslim, dalit and upper caste people to relish the food cooked collectively by themselves. 

 The queen of Doms Rani Chowdhari Ramawati Devi, the wife of late 'Dom Raja' Ishwar Lal, not only took part in cooking the kichari but also served the food to men, women and children taking at a programme held at Varunanagaram colony, Hukulganj. 
 
 "Jis terah se sab kuchh mila dene ke baad khichari banati hai, usi terah se sabhi dharm, jatiyon ko milane par hi Hindustan banata hai. Hum kisi keemat par dharm aur jatiyon mein na batein," (As the khichari is prepared by mixing all food items, in the same way Hindustan is made of the assimilation of all religions and castes. We should not be divided on religion and caste lines.), said the queen of Dom community. 
 
 The Doms, who are considered outcastes and mostly engaged in the profession of cremating dead bodies, are the custodians of the two cremation ghats -Manikarnika Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat in Varanasi. Legend says that Raja Harishchandra of Satyuga was employed at the cremation ground in Varanasi by Kallu Dom. All doms here consider themselves as descendants of Kallu Dom. 
 
 The event -'Samajik Mel-Milap' programme organised by an NGO Vishal Bharat Sansthan began with khichari cooking with active participation of Nazneen Ansari, Uma Singh, Guriya Qureshi, Ajaharuddin and the dome queen. Someone put oil in the big cooking pot, while others mixed rice, vegetables and spices in it. Sitting on the ground in the same row all relished the kichari of Makar Sankranti. Main objective of the event is to give a message of social unity and communal harmony, said the VBS president and teacher at Banaras Hindu University Rajiv Srivastava.
