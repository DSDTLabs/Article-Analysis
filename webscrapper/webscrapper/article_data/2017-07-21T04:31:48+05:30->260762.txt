THRISSUR: Forced onto the defensive by the medical college bribery allegation, the BJP responded by sacking on Thursday the leader allegedly directly involved in the graft, the move in keeping with the Modi government’s anti-corruption stand.

 Following an internal probe, BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan expelled party cooperative cell convenor R S Vinod from primary membership of the party. “The allegations against him are serious. By attracting graft charges, he has marred the party’s anticorruption image,” Kummanam said in a statement released to the media on Thursday evening. Kummanam also appealed to the BJP central leadership to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the allegations.
 
 Vinod and a few other party members were accused of taking a bribe of Rs 5.6 crore to pull strings in Delhi and obtain MCI recognition for the medical college. The bribery charge against the   rocked the Lok Sabha on Thursday after   and Congress MPs from the state raised the issue. Lok Sabha proceedings had to be suspended more than once after the Speaker denied M B Rajesh and K C Venugopal permission to speak on the matter.
 
 The leak of the probe report to the media is widely seen as a fallout of the factional feud between the groups led by former state presidents V Muraleedharan and P K Krishnadas. The   core committee and state committee meetings on Friday and Saturday are expected to take action against those responsible for the leak.
 
 While CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan termed the expulsion of Vinod an eyewash and demanded a vigilance inquiry to unearth the hawala dealings of BJP leaders in Kerala, leader of the opposition   and CPM veteran V S Achuthanandan demanded the   investigate the matter.
