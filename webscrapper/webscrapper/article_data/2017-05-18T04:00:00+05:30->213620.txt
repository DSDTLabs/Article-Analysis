Vadodara: Officials of the petrol pump opposite the M S University (MSU) campus and the Sayajigunj clock tower met the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) commissioner to make arguments opposing the notice by the VMC seeking removal of the petrol pump there.

 The VMC had issued the notice recently following which the functionaries of the petrol pump and Hindustan Petroleum (HP) approached the court. The court had asked the commissioner to hear the officials following which the meeting was held on Wednesday. The VMC had earlier razed a petrol pump in the same area as it did not have a building permission.
