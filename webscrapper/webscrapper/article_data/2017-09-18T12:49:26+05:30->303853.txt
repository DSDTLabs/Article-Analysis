NAGPUR: Schools in Nagpur division can heave a sigh of relief as authorities have rectified the date for   holiday to September 19, from the earlier September 20. 

 Divisional commissioner Anoop Kumar said the confusion was because of the dates being mentioned in the  . 
 
 “Many employee association met with us and said that the ritual will start from 19th itself and will spill over to 20th. In the light of this, we have now shifted the holiday to Tuesday,” he said.
 
 A delegation of Shikshak Bharati met with divisional commissioner Kumar last week and requested that the date be changed. 
 
 Span Nehrotra, a member of the delegation said, “Authorities should ensure that they consult people with knowledge of   dates. According to the  , the Pitrupaksh timings start from sunrise on September 19 and go on till sunset. The entire process continues easily till 10pm, so the holiday is needed on that particular day itself.” 
 
 Nehrotra said the error in date almost went unnoticed and could have caused a major blunder in schedule. 
 
 “Some schools had actually planned unit test on that day itself because, people don’t pay too much attention to dates,” said Nehrotra.
