Ram Charan will soon be seen playing the leading man in ‘Nannaku Prematho’ director Sukumar's next film. It had been reported that Samantha has bagged the leading lady's role in the upcoming flick. Initially, reports stated that actress Anupama Parameswaran was in talks for the project, but she was allegedly replaced because she 'demanded a high salary'. However, the makers of the film have now come forward to rubbish these reports.
 
 
 
Mythri Movie Makers, who are bankrolling the Ram Charan film, released an official statement denying the false reports against Anupama and even went on to say that they wish to work with the "highly talented" star in their future projects. The statement read, "This is to clarify that while it is true that Anupama Parameswaran is not a part of the Ram Charan-Sukumar project, it is not correct that it is on account of high remuneration demanded by her as reported in social media and some news columns. Such news is totally false and she has not made any such demands. We wish to reiterate that Anupama is highly talented and a thorough professional and she will certainly be a part of our future projects." 
 
With Samantha finalised as the female lead, the film is expected to go on floors on January 30th with a grand pooja ceremony.
