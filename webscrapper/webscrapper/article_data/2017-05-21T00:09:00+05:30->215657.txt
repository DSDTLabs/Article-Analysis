Indore: Palasia police arrested a   rearer when he abused and manhandled Indore municipal corporation ( ) workers, who were on duty in Badi Gwalatoli area on Saturday morning.

 Based on a tip off that cattle are being kept in the residential area, IMC workers led by official Rajesh Sharma reached the spot. The team found over 10 cows kept in a shed erected near   crematorium.
 
 “When we were about to catch the cows, their owner Yogesh Yadav and other cattle rearers raised a strong objection. The situation soon turned tense as they started manhandling our employees to disrupt our work,” said Sharma. 
 
 He said that one of their team members identified as Saddam Hussein was thrashed by the cattle rearers.
 
  Sharma called in Palasia police as the situation turned unpleasant.
 
 “Yadav has been arrested under Section 151 (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) of the CrPC. He will be produced before sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) on Monday,” said palasia police station in-charge DS Yevale.
 
 Amidst police presence, the team later caught around 25 cattle including the 12 cows owned by Yadav from the area.
 
 During a similar drive carried out in   area in February, some cow-rearers had allegedly stabbed a contract worker of IMC to death.
 
 Following the incident, IMC had launched a massive crackdown against the cattle-rearers. The civic body had razed down illegal structures, houses and cowsheds owned by. They also imposed a ban on cattle rearing without the requisite permission.
