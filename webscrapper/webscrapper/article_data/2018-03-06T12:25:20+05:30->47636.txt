The latest episode of Naamkaran starts with   calling Bebe and Shweta, who think that some random girl is calling to get Neil's attention. Bebe tells her, unaware that it's Avni that she is speaking to, that   is living with the memories of his dead wife Avni. She further adds that she should turn on the channel Raabta to listen to him.

 Next, KK asks Neil to rehearse a few lines with him. The latter refuses and suggests that if they can find that girl who has sung the song then she can help KK in cracking the scene. He further suggests that they should call all the participants in an event and thereby find the girl in question. KK likes the plan as it will also give him publicity. Neil calls DD and asks him to organize a party. 
 
 Shweta talks to Miyati about Neil. Bebe says that Mitali has feelings for Neil. Shweta and Bebe think that they should bring Miyati and Neil together.
 
 The scene shifts, Saisha says that all the participants are invited to KK's Holi party. She asks Sunehri if she has ever fallen in love with anyone. Sunehri thinks of DD and says no. Saisha asks who is DD, whose name you were uttering in sleep. She shows the video. The kids tease Sunehri. Kids think that they should rent the clothes from a friend's laundry without Avni's knowledge.
 
 Avni overhears their conversation and gives them clothes. When Sunehri asks her if she will come to the party, she declines as the media will cover that event.
 
 
  
 Next, Sunehri thanks Mitali and hands over the gift that the kids had made for her. Mitali thanks her and asks her to share the details of the family.
