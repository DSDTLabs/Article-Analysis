NOIDA: The industrialists have opposed the proposed   at the public hearing on Friday, saying that charges are already high though there is not enough supply. 

 Vipin Malhan, president,   (NEA), said that while electricity duty exemption was announced in the Industrial Policy, 2010 by the state government, it has not been implemented so far. Besides, the power department keeps security amount of two months’ average consumption and continues to demand additional security every year. “This is unjustified since billing and payment is now online and bills are paid within 35 days. So the security should not be taken or at the most, be restricted to one month bill,” said Malhan.
 
 While the average purchase price per unit is Rs 3.90, the power department is asking for Rs 7 per unit from   which in effect comes to Rs 10 per unit for them.
 
 “Since the line losses in Noida is less than 7%, compared to state’s average of 18% and at other places upto 40%, then why should we pay for others. We should have separate tariff,” said Malhan.
 
 Malhan requested UPERC chairman S K Agarwal that since the sanctioned load in Noida is more than double the power supplied to industries, the fixed charges should not be charged.
