HYDERABAD: In a bid to fulfil its poll promise of supplying safe drinking water to every household, the Telangana government has decided to store water in 30 major reservoirs to ensure supply to   pipelines. The chief minister even threw a challenge to opposition parties that he would not seek votes in the next elections if he fails to give drinking water to every household by 2018. Keeping that in mind, municipal administration and urban development minister   is leaving no stone unturned to complete Mission Bhagiratha works.

 The irrigation department has been asked to maintain Minimum Draw Down Levels ( ) in the 30 major reservoirs so that water supply through Mission Bhagiratha will not get affected.
 
 The irrigation department has proposed amendment to the operational manual on maintaining MDDL in all reservoirs. The identified reservoirs include Palair, Akkampalli, Wyra, Udayasamudram, Tail Pond, Ramanpadu, Gopaldinne, Sankara Samudram, Ranga Samudram, Gaddanna project,  ,  , Komaram Bhim, Medaram reservoir, Dharma Sagar, Sali Vagu, Ramappa Lake, Ghanpur, Singur, Dummugedem, Kinnerasani project, Peedipalli, Jurala, Koilsagar, Ellur, Kadem, Sriramsagar, Chitti Kodur, Ali Sagar, Ballal Tank and Ellampally reservoirs.
 
 â€œIt was calculated that the total requirement of Mission Bhagiratha would be around 59.17   in the first phase. By 2050, the demand will increase to 87.64 TMC feet," said a senior official. Once the amendment is passed, officials have to maintain water levels in reservoirs. The estimate has taken into consideration evaporation losses. After clearance from the CM, the same would be notified by the government.
