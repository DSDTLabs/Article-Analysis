MADURAI: Union minister of state   claimed on Sunday there was no longer cash crunch in the state and "things were back to normal". While conceding that people faced a "little hardship" as a result of the Centre's demonetisation move, Radhakrishnan said "all ATMs in the state were functioning at present." 

 He was speaking to reporters after offering prayers at the Tiruchendur temple. 
 
 Radhakrishnan said that Prime Minister  's New Year's eve speech had infused confidence among the people of having a powerful economy. "The Prime Minister has made this bold move in order to ensure that even the common man in this country is taken along in the journey of economic growth of this country,'' he said. 
 
 "If the Prime Minister was taking such a bold step, it would have undergone a lot of reviews before being implemented," he added.
 
 However, even as Radhakrishnan was making the speech there were large queues outside the ATMs in Tiruchendur and also across the southern districts, with many people not been able to get even Rs 2,000, though it was announced that the withdrawal limit would be raised to Rs 4,500 from January 1.
 
 The minister claimed that BJP has been making demands to ensure the conduct of the   for the past two years. "It is we who have been laying stress to ensure that the games are conducted for the past two years.'' The Minister expressed confidence that the game would be conducted this year.
 
 Meanwhile in a statement issued in Chennai, TNCC president   said that though BJP was holding Congress responsible for banning jallikattu through a central government notification issued on July 11, 2011, the game was conducted for three successive years after the notification was issued. 
 
 He blamed BJP for not passing an ordinance to overcome the   ban on the game. The TNCC chief announced that his party will participate in the protest demanding the conduct of Jallikattu in Madurai on January 3.
