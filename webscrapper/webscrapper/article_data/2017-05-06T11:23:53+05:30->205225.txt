 Investigators feel that after the   attack in September 2016, Pakistani handlers had activated network of spies in India to check the movement of Army troops.Most of the soldiers killed in the Uri attack were from Dogra Regiment and it is believed that 10 Dogra battalion avenged the deaths of their counterparts by executing surgical strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir on September 29. “The repair shop belonged to somebody else and Aftab's father had been working as mechanic. There was no apparent reason for Aftab to take interest in a different trade all of sudden after surgical strikes,“ said a source who had tracked Aftab for several weeks.

He worked singlehandedly and nobody in his family knew he was connected to ISI,“ said Deo.
