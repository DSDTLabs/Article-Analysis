 “Around 3 am, a passer-by informed the police patrol about Chandan lying near Meghdoot bridge. The patrol team found cuts on his wrist and a phenyl bottle lying near him,” a police officer said. Police said since Chandan had consumed Phenyle, it was difficult for him to speak. “We will record his statement. He has not said much yet. It seems there was some problem among the roommates, which then took an ugly turn. The reason for the argument is still not clear,” the police officer said adding they have informed Thane police and are registering a case of attempt to suicide.
