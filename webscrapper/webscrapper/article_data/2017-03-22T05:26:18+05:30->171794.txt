BARUIPUR:   allegedly claimed 12 lives over 24 hours till Tuesday morning in the Baruipur and Canning areas of South 24-Parganas. Agitators smashed and set ablaze five   dens in a 500m radius spread over Baruipur’s   and adjoining   in Canning. 

 While three succumbed on Tuesday morning, nine died on Monday. The dead, incidentally, include one of the hooch den owners. The deaths brought back grim memories of the 2011 hooch tragedy that left about 170 people dead in Mograhat, about 50km from Tuesday’s death zone. 
 
 Locals alleged owners of the hooch dens, all in close proximity, compete with each other by adding chemical to the country liquor. The chemical allegedly makes the liquor more intoxicating but may prove fatal. After the Mograhat tragedy, locals brought down these five dens a couple of times but they sprung up after each such display of public wrath, the residents said.
 
 Nibash Mondal, whose father Bimal died on Tuesday after consuming hooch, said: “My father had become addicted to the liquor. After the Mograhat tragedy, we had wanted to free this area of hooch dens. But they come up and run with the connivance of police and the administration.”
 
  (Baruipur) Arko Banerjee said: “I have heard about the deaths but it is not yet clear whether the victims died due to hooch. The autopsies have not been conducted.”
