TIRUVANNAMALAI: It took 45 months for a resident of   to receive his  . Thirty seven year-old  , who applied for the card in October 2013, received it a few days ago

 Vijayakumar, a resident of   in Kodanagar in Cheyyar, along with his parents, Govindasamy and Eswari, took part in the special camp organised by the local body in the year 2013 in a government school in the town to prepare the   cards. 
 
 “Myself and my parents along with a couple of our neighbours went to the camp and took the photo on October 24 in 2013. We were told that the card would be delivered to everyone within 30 to 40 days,” the applicant told TOI.
 
 Vijaykumar’s parents and neighbours received the card within two months after the special camp. “I waited for my card and did not receive it for few months. Hence, I downloaded my Aadhaar card online,” said Vijaykumar, whose Aadhaar enrollment no 000/00323/23808.
 
 The card was printed on November 22, 2013. However, it took more than three years and nine months to reach the recipient. “I received the post on Tuesday (July 4, 2017). I was surprised to see it. In fact, I forgot about the Aadhaar card all these years. Why this inordinate delay?” said Vijaykumar who runs an internet centre.
 
 When the government is very keen to make Aadhaar card mandatory for availing benefits under government welfare schemes to opening up bank accounts, why did it fail to look into the delivery system of Aadhaar and its quality, he asked. 
 
 Expressing surprise over the inordinate delay in delivering the car, Collector Prashant M Wadnere said the district administration upload the data of the applicants in the system. It would take around three months for an applicant to receive his or her card. “It is really surprising to learn an applicant received it after 45 months. We will take up the issue to the concerned official to find out what are the reasons for such delay,” said the collector.
