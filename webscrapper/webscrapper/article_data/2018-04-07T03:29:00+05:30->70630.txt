Vijayawada:   - 2018 is being observed in the city on Saturday. This year’s theme, as selected by World Health Organisation (WHO), is ‘health for all’.

 The Andhra Pradesh government is focused on promoting state-sponsored health insurance (Universal Health Care). Vital indicators are being monitored in the monthly-released health bulletins. The state is running around 30 healthcare schemes which include Thalli Bidda Express, NTR Vaidya Pariksha, Chandranna Sanchara Vaidya Seva, among others. To improve facilities at government hospitals and to aid the health department, the government has allocated Rs 8,000 crore in the state budget.
 
 World Health Organisation states every single person must be covered by medical insurance. In Andhra Pradesh, nearly 82 per cent of the population is insured under various health insurance schemes which include Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESI), Dr NTR Vaidya Seva, Tata Trust Insurance and other private services. To bringing the entire population under health insurance, the state government started Aarogya Raksha to facilitate Above Poverty Line families. However, the scheme seems to have come a cropper due to lack of promotional activity.
 
 “Health care has become a major burden on the people of the state. Some families are avoiding treatment as they are unable to afford it,” said a senior official of Health Department.
 
 One can get Rs 2 lakh health insurance by a yearly premium of Rs 1,200 under NTR Vaidyaseva’s Arogya Raksha scheme. Only one lakh families have enrolled under this scheme.
 
 “I suffered with a cardiovascular diesease. I spent Rs 2.5 lakh for three stents and an angiogram. Later, I came to know that these services are available for free under Aarogya Raksha. The government is spending huge amounts on publicising pushkarams, instead these schemes should be promoted” said M Rama Rao, a retired teacher.
