HYDERABAD: Suspecting his wife's fidelity, a 28-year-old brick kiln worker strangled her to death at their farm in   on Monday night. 

 On Sunday night,   asked his 23-year-old wife   to accompany him to a nearby village. After reaching their farm at Nagireddypally, Vittal strangled Aiswarya to death with her stole. He left the body in the fields. He then informed his family and surrendered before police. 
 
 Aiswarya, from Gollapally near Shamshabad, had married Vittal a brick kiln worker from Peddamma Tanda near Maheswaram, one-and-half-year ago.
 
 Four months after marriage, Vittal started harassing Aiswarya, suspecting she was having an affair, police said. In October, she lodged a dowry harassment complaint against Vittal and his family. Vittal was arrested subsequently, but recently Aiswarya returned to her in-law's house. A case was registered against him under section 302 (Murder) of the IPC.
