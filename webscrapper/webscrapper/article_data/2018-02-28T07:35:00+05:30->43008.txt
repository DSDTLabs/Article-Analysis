Bathinda: Bathinda airport on Tuesday became the only domestic airport in Punjab to have flights to two destinations. Flight to Jammu landed at the Bathinda airport with 17 passengers on board and took off with 36 passengers, Bathinda airport director Shobha Bhardwaj told TOI.

 Alliance Air is operating the flight on a 70-seater ATR aircraft for which the fare has been kept at Rs 1,295 per passenger. The flight will take off from Jammu at 9.15 am and reach Bathinda at 10.20 am. It will depart from Bathinda at 10.50 am and reach Jammu at 12 noon. This schedule for the flights is operational till March 24 and the next schedule will be decided later by the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA).
 
 On its arrival from Jammu, the flight received a water cannon salute from the Indian Air Force (IAF), which has its airfield adjoining the Bathinda civil airport.
 
 Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal cut a cake, which was distributed among the arriving and departing passengers, to celebrate the occasion. She flagged off the flight to Jammu.
 
 She said the flight would further consolidate Bathinda’s position as a trade, industrial and religious hub as air connectivity to Jammu will provide easy access to Vaishno Devi shrine to thousands of pilgrims from the Malwa region of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana and Rajasthan. “I am trying to get a connecting flight to Hazoor Sahib through Delhi as well,” she said.
 
 Bathinda has been selected to get the second air route to Jammu under the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) and ‘Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik-2 (UDAN-2) scheme for second tier cities. The Bathinda airport became function in December 2016, just ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab with a flight to Delhi thrice a week.
 
 The Alliance Air had been selected to start flying operations to Jammu from Bathinda, said an official from the Union civil aviation ministry.
