JAIPUR: A four-month-old baby with a chemical burn on his stomach inflicted by a quack for treatment of pneumonia is undergoing treatment at a private hospital of Sawai Madhopur. The infant was admitted to the hospital on Saturday with bronchopneumonia, burn marks on stomach and sepsis.

 The baby was brought to Sawai Madhopur from Sheopur district of   for treatment. His parents had taken the treatment from a doctor in Sheopur but as the baby did not respond to the treatment, they went to a quack in Sheopur.
 
 Sheopur is a tribal district, where bhopas (quacks) are active and it is due to superstition that people take their children for treatment to these people putting their lives at risk. The quack used a stick and dipped it in a chemical and applied it on the stomach of the baby. Since then the baby continued crying and parents rushed him to Sawai Madhopur for treatment. “It is not a new case for me. Such cases are brought to our hospital frequently. We have reported such cases to the police and health department as well,” said Dr  , pediatrician and owner of the private hospital.
 
 He said that usually quacks use hot iron for branding on stomach of children for treatment of cough, cold and pneumonia. But now cases of burns from chemical use on stomach have also been reported frequently.
 
 “It is a kind of organic acid, which quacks use for branding, which is even more dangerous than branding with hot iron. Branding with hot iron causes immediate effect but chemical continues to damage skin of the baby for a longer time,” said Dr. Swarnkar.
 
 However, the hospital claimed that the infant is recovering from sepsis and bronchopneumonia. “The cause of sepsis might be due to chemical burns,” he said.
