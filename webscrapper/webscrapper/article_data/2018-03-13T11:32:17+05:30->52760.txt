RAIPUR: A policeman went berserk with his service pistol in a   village late Sunday night, shooting a pedestrian on the road and then barging into a house and firing at a sleeping family. He then shot himself dead. 

 Four innocent persons, including an elderly woman, were critically injured. The shooter, head constable  , was said to be mentally unstable and his friends were taking him to a Baiga (witchdoctor) when he had a violent psychotic break, say police.
 
 The shooting raises serious questions. Pokram had reportedly been behaving strangely for a long time. Why did his seniors not know that he was having   issues? He was deputed as bodyguard to a senior BJP leader, which would have put him in close proximity with several  . What if he had a breakdown then? Also, why did he have his 9mm service pistol with him if he was off duty? The rule is that policemen deposit their weapons in the armoury after their shift ends. 
 
 Pokram was clad in his official safari suit and was armed when his friends were taking him to a Baiga. Balod SP Kalyan Elesella told TOI that Pokram was on duty till 10pm on Sunday in Dongargaon. "He left with six friends for Dondilohra in   in a hired vehicle. Midway, he got into an argument with his friends and started threatening them with his 9mm pistol. He pretended to fire. He ordered the driver to stop the vehicle and told his friends to get down," Elesella said.
 
 His friends tried to calm him, but Pokram continued to threaten them and chased after them with his gun, forcing everyone to scatter in terror. They hid and watched as he threw stones at passing vehicles and shot a man walking down the roadside. The friends called police but couldn't give a precise location. Pokram then started knocking on doors but no one responded.
