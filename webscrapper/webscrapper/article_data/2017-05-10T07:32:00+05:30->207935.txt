CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Tuesday announced dissolution of all district   in the state. It has also approved re-establishment of these committees and nomination of new non-official members.

 A government spokesman said the term of these new committees would be of three years but the government has the right to dissolve them any time. Acting as the link between the administration and the public, the committees would attempt to negotiate a timely resolution of public grievances. 
 
 While a section of Congress MLAs are happy at the abolishment of halqa- in charge system, others resent claiming the move would make them redundant since they would have no say in policy making. The Congress has also faced flak from some of its own MLAs for not being assertive after its victory in the polls. They complain the government has hardly made any bureaucratic and police overhaul. 
 
 Cops like Gurpreet Bhullar, who mostly served   during the  , was given an important police district like Jalandhar Rural which is a key NRI pocket. Similarly, IG  , a non regular recruit IPS and non PPS officer, was allowed to serve in the Jalandhar Zone. Under the previous government, he was posted in the same zone for nearly a year before being transferred to Jalandhar.
