 Eveidently, the civic agencies have not been able to tackle the menace of strays in Gurugram. “We deal with about 12 to 15 cases of dog bites a day. A majority of the dog bite victims are children up to the age of 14-15 years, who may suffer from serious complications in case the dog is infected,” said Dr M P Singh, district child urban nodal officer.
 
 Even though civic agencies claim to be running sterilisation drives, the number of dog bite cases do not seem to abate. “Many people feed strays, which results in canines loitering in residential areas,” said Pooja Bhardwaj, a teacher living in Sector 56.
