KOLKATA: In a primary report on the alleged rape and suicide of a   girl, the National Commission for   has pointed out “inhuman and insensitive” role of the police.

 A detailed report, likely to be tabled with the Ministry of women and child development by end of the week, will also have details of the commission’s findings during the members’ visit to Birbhum.
 
 “The girl was lying on the ground for four hours and there was nobody to help her. Later, her parents took her to another hospital. Cops were aware of the entire incident but did not take any step for the better treatment of the victim. She was neither taken to ICU nor any proper medical facility extended to her,” NCW member   said.
 
 Sahu said police had been inhuman and insensitive in treating the victim. “They should have been more sensitive towards the victim and there they failed,” she said. “It is also their duty to ensure safety of NCW members when they visit the spot. Instead, I was mobbed there. This is not the first time such a thing happened in   during the NCW team visit,”   said. While Sahu did not comment on observations she made in the primary report, she alleged political interference.
 
 Meanwhile, Birbhum police in its submission at the judicial magistrate court said they did not have the case diary with them. On the day of her visit, Sahu had allegedly taken the case diary from the police in absence of photocopies of the report.
