Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday directed the Dindigul police to consider and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law on the representation filed by TTV Dhinakaran’s supporter seeking permission to celebrate the birth anniversary of late chief minister and general secretary of AIADMK, J Jayalalithaa. Justice P Rajamanickam gave this direction on a petition filed by R Thangadurai from Nilakottai in Dindigul district. The petitioner’s counsel said the petitioner wanted to hold the celebration on March 3 in Batlagundu in Dindigul district. Seeking permission, he sent representations to the police on February 19 and 26 , but police gave no response. Hence, it was necessary to direct the police to grant permission for the event, the counsel said.
