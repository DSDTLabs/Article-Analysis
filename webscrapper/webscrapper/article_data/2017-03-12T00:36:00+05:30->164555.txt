Navi Mumbai: Motor pumps used by hotels in Airoli, allegedly to draw excess water were promptly confiscated by ward officials on Saturday. The civic chief   had visited   on the same day to interact with the local residents. 

 Complaints were raised about the hotels using booster pumps to draw excess water. Even as Mundhe sought an explanation, two seized pumps were presented before the civic chief.
 
 “The issue of illegal tapping of water by the local hotels was addressed after it was brought to the notice of the commissioner,” said a resident who was present at the meeting. 
 
 Mundhe also inquired about misuse of civic properties, haphazard positioning of auto stands and construction of a library on public space. 
 
 “Civic streetlights have been reportedly usurped for personal use. Also, a library has come up on public space. Auto stands across the node are adding to traffic congestion. These issues will be probed for appropriate action,” said additional municipal commissioner, Ankush Chavan. 
 
 Locals complained that the towing services making the most of parking crunch to harass residents. “Vehicles get towed at random and penalty receipts are not issued. Parking space must be provided to stop the towing mafia,” said an irate resident.
