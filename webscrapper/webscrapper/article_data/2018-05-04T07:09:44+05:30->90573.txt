Rapper   cut a call short to wife and   to engage in a heartfelt chat with a member of the paparazzi.

  
 According to reports, the rapper, 40, was walking with a friend and trailed by a guard outside of the Calabasas Tech Center in Calabasas, California, as he chatted on the phone with Kim, 37.The 'Runaway' singer wrapped up his call with her to field questions from the cameraman about the 'crazy threats' he has faced -- presumably from  , the rapper who called upon   gang members to 'f*** Kanye up' after the rapper stated his support for US President Donald Trump in recent weeks.
 
 "Babe, let me talk to you in person, please?" West said to the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star, who could be heard responding, "OK, bye."
 
 "We love everybody and it's all love, really," Kanye told the paparazzi, before shaking his hand, asking what his name was and how many children he has.
