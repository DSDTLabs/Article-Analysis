DONA PAULA: Describing the appointment of the cabinet advisory committee (CAC) “unprecedented”, former finance minister   on Wednesday said it was important for CM Manohar Parrikar to delegate his powers to one of his cabinet colleagues so the government could function properly.

 “The present situation in Goa is unprecedented,”   told reporters at International Centre Goa, Dona Paula. “I feel we need to appoint someone in place of Parrikar till he returns healthy.”
 
 Sinha, a former senior BJP leader who quit the party to co-found the  , has repeatedly expressed concern over the BJP’s tendency to undermine constitutional norms and democratic principles.
 
 “The Constitution may not specify every procedure in letter, but there is a spirit, and if one works as per the spirit of the Constitution, I feel this government should have one person appointed in place of the CM in his absence. You need not call the person ‘chief minister’, but he should handle the responsibilities of the chief minister,” Sinha said.
 
 He pointed out that even Prime Minister   appoints a cabinet colleague to address administrative issues while he is travelling. “When the PM travels for over 10 days, somebody is given his responsibilities,” Sinha said. “The cabinet meeting is conducted. The PM, in this case, is healthy and available for decision-making, yet a person is given charge.” 
 
 Sinha also expressed his displeasure with how the BJP-led coalition formed the government despite the   emerging as the single largest party.
 
 “In the BJP there is a saying, ‘where the party gets the mandate, we will definitely form the government, and where we do not get the mandate, we will still form the government’,” Sinha said.
