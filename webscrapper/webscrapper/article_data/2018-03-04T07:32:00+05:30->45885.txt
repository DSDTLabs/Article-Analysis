SHIMLA: To spread about health hazard caused by honking, the state government would soon launch a 'No Honking Campaign' in  . In a meeting chaired by additional chief secretary   in Shimla on Saturday, she said that lack of awareness about noise pollution caused by honking and detrimental impact on human health and behaviour was a major concern which needed to be addressed at the earliest. The government had already banned the use of pressure horns, she added.

 To tackle the problem of unnecessary honking, special efforts would be made to inculcate driving etiquettes in drivers and civic sense in younger generations, Nanda said, adding that since   was a tourist destination, it was necessary to provide peaceful environment. The state also was home for large number of birds and animals and noise pollution was a detrimental for their existences.
 
 She said that the campaign would be carried in consultation and through effective use of electronic and social media. She said that massive information campaign for sensitizing drivers, taxi unions, bus and truck drivers and schoolchildren would also be carried out. Police personals would be given   at selected locations and they may even be asked to use 'Stop' and 'Go' boards instead of whistles, she added.
 
 She said that campaign would be carried out with the assistance of various stake holders such as police, state pollution control board, district administration, urban local bodies, public works department, educational institutional and information and public relations department. Assistance of NGOs would also be sought for effective implementation of this campaign.
 
 Nanda said that a campaign would be launched in the first phase from Shimla and Manali towns and would cover other urban areas of the state in a phased manner.
