 has always expressed his responsibility towards the nation and social causes, as it evident in his monthly blog. All this has caught the attention of none other than Prime Minister  , who has written a letter to the actor, asking him to join the Swatch Bharat programme. In the letter dated September 9, he has written, "A clean India is the noblest service we can do for the poor, downtrodden and the marginalised. Unclean surroundings have an adverse impact on the weaker sections of society even more. Cinema is one of the most effective medium to bring about change at a large scale. As a much adored film personality, you have the power to influence people's lives positively. Your participation in the   would help connect millions to the noble initiative. Personally, I invite you to lend your support to the 'Swachhata Hi Seva' movement and dedicate some time for the cause of Swachh Bharat. Your participation will further inspire others to be part of the movement."

 Mohanlal has, in turn, expressed his views on the matter via a facebook post. "To be a responsible citizen we need to be proud of our nation first , we need to understand this country is our ‘home’ and ‘home’ is our identity.
 
 We need to keep our ‘home’ clean, so that each one of us live in a clean environment and our guests (the people who visit us from other countries) are happy to be with us. I think, none of the day is better than the birth anniversary day of our Father of Nation when we should promise ourselves and our ‘home’ that we will keep it clean forever and never make it dirty in future.
 
 Believe me our ‘home’ will light up more this Diwali than all the previous years if we pledge to keep our ‘home’ clean from this day .
 I support ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ movement and dedicate myself to this great and noble cause.
 Lets’ Build a New (clean) India.
 
 Jai Hind," he wrote, besides making a seperate post wishing the PM a happy birthday.
