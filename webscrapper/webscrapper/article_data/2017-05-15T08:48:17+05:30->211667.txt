NEW DELHI: It was the battle for the wooden spooners on this tenth season of the IPL. And home is where the heart is, is what   must have realised here on Sunday. A largely forgettable   season where   came woefully undone despite their batting might, saw some salvaging ­ if futile ­ with a thrilling 10-run victory over  .

 The visitors, after losing as many as 10 games, recorded their third overall win. Even here, Delhi couldn't finish their disappointing IPL season on a high. It was RCB's second win against Delhi in an inconsequential last game of the season.
 
 Kohli, who himself had a poor run of form, can seek some comfort ahead of the Champions Trophy in a fortnight's time, with a much-needed, assuring 58 off 45 balls with three fours and sixes on his home turf where he's learnt his trade.
 
 The Kotla fans, who came in large numbers to cheer for Kohli more than the Daredevils, went back home happy, as they got their dose of a typical Kohli knock which lifted Bangalore to 161 for six in 20 overs. In reply, Delhi were skittled out for 151 in 20 overs. The match actually went down to the wire as Delhi needed 13 from last over. But left-arm Pawan Negi ensured a consolation win for Bangalore.
 
 Crucially, Kohli showed glimpses of his old self while playing a few exquisite shots in front of the packed Kotla. A particular shot over the extra-cover boundary off Corey Anderson which looked as if he was defending while ball flew out of the boundary for a six.
 
 Kohli was ably supported by  , who played with almost same momentum to make 48 off 38 balls. They held the innings together to build a good partnership that gave the basic foundation to the Bangalore innings.
 
 Earlier, RCB won the toss and opted to bat in anticipation that the pitch would turn in the second half of the game. It was Pant who showed his batting prowess with some clean hitting and showed some semblance of fight. Otherwise there wasn't much to cheer about Delhi batting.
