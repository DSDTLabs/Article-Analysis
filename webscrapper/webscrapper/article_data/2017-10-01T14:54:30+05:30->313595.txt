CHENNAI: Superstar   on Sunday took a dig at actor   who is planning to enter politics. Speaking at the inauguration of the memorial of legendary Tamil actor   in Chennai, Rajinikanth said it takes more than fame and money to succeed in politics.

 “Legendary actor Sivaji Ganesan taught his followers a valuable lesson in politics”, said Rajinikanth. The superstar said Sivaji Ganesan, who had stood and lost in his own constituency, proved that fame and money alone were not enough to succeed in politics.
 
 As Kamal looked on, Rajinikanth said, “To succeed in politics, there needs to be something more. Only the people know what that is. I promise I don’t know. I think Kamal Haasan knows what that is. Even if he does, he will not tell me.”
 
 Rajinikanth went on to joke that Kamal would have told him what that (secret) was if he had asked him two months ago. It was in July when Kamal began his scathing attack on the ruling AIADMK government in  .
 
 “When I asked him what that is, Kamal Haasan said that he would tell me if I went with him,” the superstar said.
 
 Kamal Haasan did not respond to Rajinikanth’s jibes during his speech.
 
 Kamal said, “Sivaji Ganesan is an actor who transcended state, national and continental boundaries. Even if I had not become an actor, I would have been at this event as a film buff. Nobody could have stopped me from coming here today.” 
 
 Kamal went on to add that he was one of the thousands of actors trying desperately to adhere to the standards set by Sivaji Ganesan.
