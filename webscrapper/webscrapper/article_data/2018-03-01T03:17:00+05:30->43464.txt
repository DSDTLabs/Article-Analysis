Panaji: The Gawada, Kunbi, Velip, and Dhangar Federation (Gakuved) on Wednesday said that deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo is trying to woo migrants, especially the Banjara community, for mere electoral gains. The federation alleged that he’s doing this by legalizing their illegal hutments through the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA) and by assuring them ST status in Goa. 
 
 The federation activists said that while Goan communities, especially the ST community, are deprived of their rights, jobs, and land, Lobo was playing vote bank politics with migrants. 
  
 “The Banjara samaj people come here, construct huts anywhere, and later these politicians give them ration cards, voter cards, and legalize their houses,” said Gakuved general secretary Rupesh Velip. On the other hand, “many houses of Goans are being demolished,” he said.
