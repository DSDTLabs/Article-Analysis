AHMEDABAD: Two years ago, the   (AMC) had advertised that it would build 6,349 EWS houses for the urban poor in some of the prime localities or areas in close proximity to them in Sola, Gota, Thaltej and Makarba as part of phase-IV of state government’s EWS housing scheme. The scheme was so popular that the   had received 70,203 applications for phase-IV.

 On Wednesday, however, only 2,805 EWS houses were allotted to beneficiaries, with very few located near posh localities. 
 
 A senior EWS-housing official told TOI that nearly 3,241 houses were to come up in   and Gota areas, most of them located in town planning schemes 31, 32, 40, 41 and 42. 
 
 “Most of these EWS housing schemes were to come up adjacent to bungalow schemes and upcoming 2-BHK and 3-BHK residential schemes and now they have been put in cold storage until further decisions are taken,” says the AMC official.
 
 “Though we had promised close to 6,500 houses in phase-IV, we could construct 2,805. We have a housing scheme coming up in Bodakdev ward also and two sets of EWS housing schemes in Gota ward and two EWS housing societies in Makarba,”   chairperson   told TOI. 
 
 He later said that nearly 2,849 applications were chosen for the draw and 1,389 applications were kept in waiting. A senior AMC official told TOI that last year too, in new west zone two EWS schemes were shifted from a prime location to the outskirts, when local builders pressurised ahead of elections and feared that the market value of their schemes will drop.
