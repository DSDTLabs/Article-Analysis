AHMEDABAD: The wedding season and festive muhurats seem to have failed to revive sales of the yellow metal in Gujarat. According to a report, ‘Gold Demand Trends’ by  , gold demand dropped by 12% in India in the first quarter of 2018. The trend in   is no different. 

 In fact, gold demand has declined by 54.4% in the first quarter (January to March) of 2018. 
 
 Gold imports stood at 11.2 metric tonnes (MT) in first quarter of 2018, while they stood at 24.5 MT in the corresponding quarter of 2017.
 
 According to the report, rising gold prices and a depreciating rupee against the dollar, were the primary reasons for the decline in gold demand.
 
 Gold prices have mostly remained above the Rs 32,000 mark, for the past three weeks. 
 
 On Thursday, prices of the yellow metal stood at Rs 32,050 per 10 gram. Jewellers and analysts say increasing prices made people stay away from buying gold.
 
 “Gold demand remained low key due to prices being on the higher side, even during the wedding season and the festive muhurat of Akshaya Tritiya. Purchases dropped significantly and only regular buyers invested in gold,” said Shanti Patel, president, Gems and Jewellery Trade Council.
 
 Analysts also said that the overall gold imports went down in January, in anticipation of a duty cut on the existing 10% basic customs duty on gold in the Union Budget on announced on February 1. 
 
 Moreover, cash shortage too hurt rural belts and sales remained subdued. “In April, several rural areas were adversely hit with the cash shortage and therefore, the demand for gold went down,” said a city jeweller.
 
 “Metal to metal trade has gone up significantly. Most people tend to make bulk purchases using accumulated gold in the form of coins and bars and exchange it for jewellery. This has also led to a decline in imports,” said Haresh Acharya, secretary, Bullion Federation of India.
