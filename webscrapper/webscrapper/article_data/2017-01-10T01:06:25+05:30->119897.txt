CHENNAI: A 36-year-old research scholar from a social sciences institute in Bengaluru created a flutter at transport minister R  's press conference, saying she was caned by police at the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) in Koyambedu on Monday. Based on her complaint, police head constable   and police constable Rajapandi have been transferred to vacancy reserve and asked to report to the city police control room immediately. 

 According to the complaint, the woman got down at the bus station in the morning and stayed there because she had a migraine. She said two cops with lathis woke her up around 7am and asked her to leave. "I pleaded for ten more minutes and promised to take a bus to Saidapet," she said. However, the duo refused. 
 
 Receiving the petition, minister Vijayabhaskar assured necessary action. "The victim claims she was lathi-charged. It would be investigated," he told reporters.
 
 However, police refuted the charges. A police officer said the constables were on routine duty to move squatters from the bus station and no individual was targeted.   deputy commissioner of police   will submit a detailed report.
