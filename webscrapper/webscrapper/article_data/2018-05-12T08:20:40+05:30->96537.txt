KOLKATA: Grandmaster   registered a ‘double’ when he annexed the   in Ahmedabad last Saturday. Babu, who is also the reigning national champion in the classical format which he won in Patna last November, however, missed out on a unique hat-trick of titles when he finished runners-up in the national blitz meet that concluded on last Sunday.

 
 After a nail-biting 11th and final round, Babu was tied with GM   for the first place with 9.5 points. But Babu emerged as the champion in the four-day event on a better tie-break score with Chidambaram securing the second place.
 
 But Babu’s fine run was, however, halted by International Master   who clinched the blitz title. Interestingly, it was Sharma who was the only one to beat Babu in the rapid format too where the former finished third.
 
 In spite of missing out on a chance to become the single national champion in all three formats, Babu was happy with his results. “Obviously, I didn’t expect to win the titles here. I was only looking for some experience as I had last played the national rapid and blitz meets back in 2008,” Babu told a chess website.
