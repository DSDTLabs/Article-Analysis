 Inaugurating the   of the chemistry department, the minister said that the buildings in the college will be renovated keeping in mind the historical importance and significance of these structures. He also sought detailed report from the college authorities in this regard.
 
 “There was a failure when it comes to promoting government run colleges which has showcased exemplary performance in the field of education in the previous years.
