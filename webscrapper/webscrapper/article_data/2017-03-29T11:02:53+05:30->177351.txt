LUCKNOW: Governor   on Tuesday questioned the Constitutional validity of appointment of eight-time SP MLA Ram Govind Chaudhary as the  . In a letter to the assembly secretariat, the governor has said that the way outgoing Speaker Mata Pradad Pandey notified the appointment should be placed before the new Assembly.

 In his letter, Naik has raised a question mark over the haste with which the SP recommended the name of Chaudhary as the Leader of Opposition. Describing it as unconstitutional, the governor said that as Pandey had already lost the election, he is just technically the Speaker. “Since the new Assembly has not elected a new Speaker, constitutionally, he cannot take any such decision,” he points out.
 
 The SP on March 27 had elected Chaudhary as the Leader of Opposition and the outgoing Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey notified it also. Taking note of the reports that Pandey who is not a member of the houses, had notified the appointment, Naik reacted sharply and booked Pandey.
 
 “Mata Prasad Pandey could just technically be the Speaker, but constitutionally first of all the new Assembly has to elect its Speaker and then the appointment Leader of Opposition should be notified,” Naik says.
