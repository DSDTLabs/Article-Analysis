AHMEDABAD:   appeared to be buoyant on the occasion of Guru   on Thursday, reviving from a dull spell after   and the consequent economic slowdown in trade. Compared to a normal day, sales increased by 30% on account of purchases considered auspicious. While jewellers rejoiced with the slight signs of revival, estimates indicate that sales were down by 50%-60% compared to the same time last year.

 “Sales at our showroom picked up after afternoon and the buying streak continued. People do tend to make investments in   on auspicious occasions and against a normal day, sales appeared to be nearly double,” said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
 
 Most customers are shopping for upcoming weddings in families and specifically tend to plan their purchases on such auspicious days. The price of the yellow metal settled Rs 29,800 per 10g on Thursday, a marginal drop of Rs100 from the previous day. Moreover, several jewellers and retailers offered hefty discounts on making charges, with a view to woo customers.
 
 Interestingly, gold jewellery purchases are now being done online and by cheque transactions. “People have begun purchasing gold on credit and debit cards and even through cheque payments. In fact 98% of our customers now make payments through debit cards or else through cheque,” said Jigar Soni, another city-based jeweller.
 
 The major losses that jewellers faced was from the rural customers. “Around 60% of our customers come from rural areas and there are hardly any customers from these areas because they do transactions in cash and many of them don’t even have PAN cards,” added Soni.
