CHARMINAR: Patients at   are facing a lot of inconvenience as the only lift in the emergency block, where the operation theatre is located, has been dysfunctional for over a year. Established during the reign of Nizams, the  , popularly known as Government Unani Hospital, is a public hospital near Charminar.

 It lacks basic facilities and is in need of dire attention. The lack of lift forces forcing patients to climb up the stairs for several storeys. Patients who are brought to the hospital in emergency situations are put on a stretcher, carried all the way to the first floor on a ramp behind the building and from there to the operation theatre on the first floor.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “We have 1,500 to 2,000 out patients every day. We get many patients with paralysis and arthritis and if they have to climb the stairs for treatment, it’s very harsh on,” said Dr A A  , state general secretary,   (TUMOA). “It’s an old lift and needs maintenance. But that can’t happen unless the budget is sanctioned for repairs from the directorate office,” he added.
 
 While casualty wards in the hospital are on the ground floor, the emergency and trauma care unit is on the first floor.
 
 “It takes a lot of extra time to take a patient to the emergency ward using the ramp instead of the lift,” said a patient who was waiting for medicines.
 
 On condition of anonymity, an associate professor of the medical college said, “Hospitals should have lifts for transporting patients and equipment. There have been instances here where pregnant women have delivered midway on the ramp, while being carried to the first floor on a stretcher.”
 
 “Patients who are brought in emergency situations need immediate ventilator support. Delaying treatment can even result in death,” he said.
