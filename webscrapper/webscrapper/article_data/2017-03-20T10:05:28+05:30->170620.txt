NEW DELHI: The final of the   between Bengal and Tamil Nadu gained in significance after   arrived to join the Bengal team. Tamil Nadu has had the more convincing run into the final but with Shami ready to take the new ball on Monday,  's inform batting lineup faces a stiff challenge at the Kotla.

 Shami hasn't played much cricket after being sidelined with a knee injury after the third Test against England in December. The fast bowler has been going through his rehab while travelling with the Indian team. Chairman of the selectors MSK Prasad and fellow selector   will have a close eye on Shami as they are likely to announce the teams for the Deodhar Trophy on Monday itself.
 
 The Bengal team has a score to settle with Tamil Nadu, having lost two consecutive finals in 2009 and 2010. Skipper   still has those memories fresh in his mind. "I remember that we dropped  's catch in the 2009 final and   was dropped during 2010 finals. They are a fantastic 50overs side. Also, the Kotla pitch is pretty similar to the ones in Chennai. So they are familiar with conditions. But we also have happy memories of this ground as we won the trophy in 2012 when Dada (Sourav Ganguly) was around," Tiwary said.
 
 Dinesh Karthik will take confidence from the fact that his batsmen have been able to dominate in spite of Mukund and Vijay both travelling with the Indian team. "We have a strong bench strength. It would have been nice if either of those two had been here but we have a well-balanced side anyway," Karthik said. "I would not like to say we are the favourites as Bengal too have been very good in the tournament," the wicketkeeper batsman added.
