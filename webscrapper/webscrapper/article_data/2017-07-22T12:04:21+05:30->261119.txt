PUNE: A 22-year-old labourer died and two others   after a part of the hillock adjacent to a construction   in Kondhwa caved in on Friday afternoon.

 The labourer,   (22) of Kondhwa, who hailed from Uttar Pradesh, died when he was trapped under the soil and mud, the Kondhwa police said.
 
 Senior inspector Satish Govekar said a case of accidental death has been registered. “We will study the matter and then take a call on registering an offence,” Govekar said.
 
 When contacted, builder   told TOI, “It was an unfortunate accident, a natural calamity. Our condolences to the family of the labourer. We are investigating the matter and cooperating with the police.”
 
 Govekar said the construction began a few days ago. “The soil on the hillock had loosened due to heavy rain. Around 11.30am, some portion of the soil all of sudden caved in and three workers at the site were trapped beneath it,” he added.
 
 The other workers immediately removed the mud and the soil and rushed all three to a nearby hospital. “Alam was declared dead on arrival, while two others were discharged after preliminary treatment,” Govekar added.
 
 The builder has obtained all necessary permissions for the construction. “Our probe is on,” Govekar said.
 
 Palresha said all precautionary measures were taken. “There were safety nets along the side of the hillock. There were hardly any workers on the site as work had started only a few days ago,” he added.
