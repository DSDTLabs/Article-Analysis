GURUGRAM: Mohit Verma, a lawyer from Rohtak travelled for around 98km to Ghamroj on Tuesday to meet the kin of   who has been accused of killing seven-year-old Ryan International School student Pradhyumn Thakur. Verma will appear for Kumar to fight his case in the court.

 “I heard that no lawyer was ready to fight his case. The decision taken by the district bar association, Gurgaon and the bar association, Sohna is absolutely wrong. Everyone has the right to get a lawyer and defend himself in the court of law. There are differences bewteen a lawyer appointed by the district legal services authority and a lawyer hired by an accused or a suspect. The lawyer hired by an accused will work hard for his client to get justice,” he said.
 
 Verma completed his law degree in 2014. Earlier, he had fought two high-profile cases. He had appeared in court for one of the nine accused, a minor, in the ‘Rohtak Nirbhaya case’. 
 
 Though police declared his client a 22-year-old, Verma got him declared a minor by the court. “The further hearing is still under way,” Verma said. Verma also represented Sumit, the main accused in the ‘Sonipat Nirbhaya case’, in the court where all testimonies had gone in his favour. Verma said he would file the ‘vakalatnama’ on September 18. “It’s clear that the school has tampered with the evidence,” he added.
