Greater Noida: Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has started issuing show-cause notices ahead of cancellation of nine allotments in its area. The developers — seven group housing and two institutional builders — owe the Authority more than Rs 830 crore. They have been asked to act before April 15 or face action from the Authority.

 According to YEIDA officials, notices were issued to two builders on Thursday and the rest on Friday. “We have started issuing show-cause notices to the developers as they have not fulfilled their commitments,” said Arunvir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO), YEIDA.
 
 “Some have defaulted on the rescheduled payment plan policy offered to them last year. These defaulters were to pay 15% of their pending amount by September 2016. Despite repeated reminders, they have failed to pay up,” he said. “All the developers have also failed to construct across nearly 450 acres of land in keeping with their agreements and   deed clauses. Hence we have been left with no choice but to issue them show-cause notices to them and start plot allotment cancellation procedure after April 15,” he told TOI.
 
 Explaining the action, Amarnath Upadhyay, additional CEO (ACEO), YEIDA, said, “After initiating the amnesty scheme, we have received about 25 applications from builders opting for the rescheduled payment plan. According to the plan, property owners had to pay 15% of their outstanding dues besides paying the rest in instalments. They also had to pay 15% of the additional compensation amount of 64.7%, which has to be distributed to farmers,” he said.
