NEW DELHI: After a seminar was called off at DU’s   by the dean for “not following proper procedure”, a video went viral on social media showing students angrily accusing her of curtailing their “freedom of expression”. The students claimed that the dean didn’t allow the programme because “she was unhappy with the speakers and the topic”.

 The dean, Ved Kumari, on her part, accused seminar convener Rupender Chaudhary of “threatening the vendors” of a book exhibition at the faculty on Saturday. Chaudhary vehemently denied the charge.
 
 Chaudhary denied having used any abusive language in the video. This is the second incident involving the faculty in recent times. Earlier, a video had surfaced on social media showing DUSU president Satender Awana targeting the dean.
 
 A seminar, titled ‘Freedom of Speech — Under Constitution of India’, was scheduled for Saturday. Among the speakers invited for the event were former Chief Justice of Patna high court Iqbal, Ahmed Ansari, high court lawyer Monika Arora and ABVP national secretary  .
 
 The dean said the event was cancelled because the organisers did not follow proper procedure and there was “lack of clarity on the source of funding”. In a mail to the organisers, the dean wrote she was “preoccupied with the ongoing book exhibition” and would not give the keynote address.
 
 Students claimed this was an attack on their freedom. “If freedom of speech is curbed in an institution like the law faculty, is there any hope anywhere else?” asked Rupender Chaudhary.
 
 Kumari, meanwhile, said that “cancellation can happen only if something was permitted”. She claimed that she was declared the keynote speaker without consent. 
 
 Chaudhary said that the dean had initially given permission, but rescinded it later. “How can an event take place without the head of an institution speaking,” he asked.
