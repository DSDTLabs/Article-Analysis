 is alleged to have resorted to round-tripping, or exporting and importing the same diamond consignment several times, to dupe banks. A look at what it really involves...

 
 
 It’s the practice where some traders export the same stock of polished diamonds multiple times to borrow from banks against the receivables at a lower interest rate than what is available through traditional money-lenders
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Company X applies for pre- shipment credit for three months from a bank to get a working capital of say
 
 $50 million to import rough diamonds from Belgium and pay for labour charges and other expenses
 
 
 
 
 Company X cuts and polishes the diamonds and exports them for a value of $80 million to company Y, either in Dubai, Hong Kong or US. This foreign firm is usually owned by a relative or cartel associated with company X
 
 
 
 After export, the firm takes post-shipment credit of
 
 $80 million against export receivables, usually extended by banks for up to six months. Against this, the firm repays $50 million extended as pre- shipment credit to the bank
 
 
 
 
 Round tripping of diamonds first caught the Centre’s attention in 2010-11, when data showed an unprecedented 60% increase in polished diamond at about Rs 12,900 crore
 
 Then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee imposed 2% import duty on polished diamonds in 2012 with a view to stamping out round tripping
 
 Round tripping became rampant since 2007, when the Centre scrapped a 3% import duty and allowed free imports of cut and polished diamonds
