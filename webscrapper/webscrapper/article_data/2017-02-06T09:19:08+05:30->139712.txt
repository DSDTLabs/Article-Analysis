GOA: Comedian Sally Mascarenhas’s seventh tiatr, ‘Maim Paiche Bessaum’ (Parents’ blessings), is a family-based tale that strives to convey to its audiences that humaneness is the richest wealth one can possess.

Despite his mother’s persuasion, the young man, who proceeds to Bengaluru for work after his studies, is determined to marry his college sweetheart. His mother, meanwhile, showers all her love upon her affluent, elder daughter-in-law. 
 
 The story takes a twist after the mother meets with an accident.
