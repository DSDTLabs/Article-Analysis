BENGALURU: Retail prices of tomatoes, hovering in the range of Rs 80-Rs 100 till recently, have dropped to Rs 45-Rs 60, and market experts expect them to crash further. 

 On Monday, the per kg price of tomatoes at Hopcoms outlets was Rs 58. 
 
 The downward spiral in prices has brought smiles on the face of customers, who are gearing up for festivities during this lunar month of Shravana. Varamahalakshmi Vratha on Friday marks the beginning of a three-month-long season of festivities.
 
 Traders at the agricultural produce and marketing committee (APMC) premises in Kolar, which happens to be Asia's second-largest tomato market, attributed the dip in prices to increase in supply.
 
 "Though the demand for tomatoes has remained constant for a month, supply has increased by 20% to 30%, with the produce coming from places like   district in   and Challakere of Chitradurga district in Karnataka. Favourable weather has resulted in a good yield in these places and farmers are bringing in additional truckloads of tomatoes to Kolar every day. A good chunk of tomatoes from Anantapur is also being sent to New Delhi," said Srinath C R from CMR Mandi (primary assembly market) at the Kolar APMC.
 
 Located about 70km from Bengaluru, Kolar is next only to Nashik in Maharashtra in tomato business. Apart from Bengaluru, which receives a good chunk of its tomatoes from here, supplies from Kolar go to Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and some north Indian states.
 
 Traders at Kolar said if supply remains steady, prices will fall further in the coming days. "Till last week, a 15-kg box of tomatoes was being sold for Rs 200-Rs 1,100, depending on the quality of the yield. On Monday, the same box cost Rs 200-Rs 700," said a trader.
