Actor   said she is game to return in the teen drama "Dawson's Creek" if a reunion is proposed.

 The 37-year-old actor played Jen Lindley, who dies in the season finale of the show.
 
 Williams told an entertainment portal that she feels "neither here nor there" about her character's death.
 
 She, however, said, "If there's ever talk of a reunion show or something, I'm like... 'It would be so funny to be a ghost and like show up in people's dreams'."
 
 The TV show, which aired from 1998 to 2003, chronicled the fictional lives of a close-knit group of friends beginning in high school and continuing in college.
 
 It also starred James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes and   in the main lead.
 
 Van Der Beek said the reboot would have to be "a reinvention of sorts".
 
 But Holmes said she liked how the show panned out, before the arrival of the Internet era.
 
 "What I love about this show is that it existed at a time pre-social media, pre-Internet, and it was nostalgic when we were shooting it. So I really like it where it is, to be honest," she said.
 
 "Dawson's Creek" is currently celebrating its 20th anniversary.
