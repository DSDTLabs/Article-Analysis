FAIZABAD: A BJP MP has written an open letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the “pathetic condition of sports” in the state.

  MP Brij Bhushan Singh has also blamed the state government for the poor condition of sportspersons of the state.
 
 “Please save sports of   from disgrace. The sports minister of the state is a sportsman. In spite of this, our sportspersons could not perform as compared to other smaller states,” the letter states. Referring to the Commonwealth Games, Singh wrote, “The reason behind the poor performance of sportspersons is that the government cannot provide employment and jobs to sportspersons which they deserve. We cannot raise fingers on former governments unless we take solid steps to ensure jobs for sportspersons.”
 
 Posted on his   wall, the letter from Singh further says, “The population of Uttar Pradesh is more than that of Haryana, Delhi, Manipur, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In Commonwealth Games, these states bagged 55 medals but Uttar Pradesh got only five. Despite this sorrowful situation, people of authority in Uttar Pradesh, those in government or at administrative level, are not affected.”
 
 Targeting Yogi, Singh wrote, “In Uttar Pradesh, there is no provision for direct recruitment of sportspersons to the posts of gazetted officers.”
