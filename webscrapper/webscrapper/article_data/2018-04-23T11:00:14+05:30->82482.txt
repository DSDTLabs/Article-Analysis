LUDHIANA: With summer vacations round the corner, local   authorities have decided to collect water samples from drinking water taps five days in a week and test the same. The decision has been taken in the view to help regular travellers get clean drinking water during summer season when the consumption is increased to a great extent.

 Speaking on the issue,  , mechanical in-charge of sanitation department, said local railway officials have decided to take the sample of drinking from the taps at the station on every second day so that the presence of Escherichia coli bacteria (E.coli) could not go above the permissible amount. If the level of the said bacteria exceeds an optimum level, it could lead to health issues for the passengers consuming the same. 
 
 “We are trying our best to provide pure water to each and every passenger. Even the water coolers have been repaired to ensure that there is a supply of cold water for the passengers at railway station during the peak summer season.”
