It was one of the cheerful and colourful weekends that brought the art lovers together under one roof. The solo painting titled, ‘Lost & Found’ by Upasana Asrani was quite a treat for the visitors. Achim Fabig, Consul General of Germany and Didem Atahan inaugurated the event.   To match the splash of colours on the canvas, the art lovers too wore colourful outfits, which went well with the arty mood at the gallery. Conny Wegener was seen in a floral print shirt that had a splash of green, pink, orange, yellow and purple.    Renna wore an embellished white crop top with a needle and thread work of roses and leaves on it. Swarupa flaunted her Jaipuri print gown, while Sarah was seen in a green and red floral print dress. The visitors spent the evening exchanging thoughts on different forms of art.
