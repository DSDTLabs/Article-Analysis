HYDERABAD: After a successful hip   at the   last February, courtesy the Chief Minister's Relief Fund, Afghan youth Abdul Kahar is all set to fly back to his home town Paktika. 

 It was two years ago that a bullet pierced Kahar's hip after he was caught in a crossfire between extremists and Afghan security forces. He arrived in India after a fellow Afghan told him the Osmania General Hospital in the city would treat him.
 
 His father, Abdul Razaq, speaking in Urdu with a thick Pashtun accent says that both are indebted to the city for its kindness and the government which paid for Kahar's treatment through the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. "It is not a small thing to spend thousands of rupees on us strangers. The people of this city have been very kind," he says.
 
  Kahar and Razaq wish to express their gratitude to the Telangana government before they leave. "Afghanistan jaane se pehle hum iss hukoomat ko shukriya kehna chaahte hain (We want to thank this government before we leave for Afghanistan)," Razaq says. 
 
 Responding to the Afghan's request fo r a meeting, municipal administration and urban development department minister K T Ramarao said that it would be a 'delight' to meet the Afghans before they leave.
