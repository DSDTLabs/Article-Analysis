INDORE: Indore Municipal Corporation ( ) is set to continue its   owners on Monday at  . Officials of the civic body said more than 11   would be razed in the area on Monday.

 They said all preparations had been done in the area and notices were sent to property owners to vacate. However, sources said that all structures were not vacated till late evening on Sunday.
 
 “We have asked them to vacate their houses. If they do not do it on their own, we will make them vacate in the morning,” said MS Chouhan, deputy commissioner, IMC. He added they were not sure if they would be able to clear the area in a single day.
 
 “If need be, the drive will continue on Tuesday as well,” Chouhan said. Officials said they had already informed cops about the drive and have been assured of proper security.
 
 Most people of the area have raised their voices against the planned action. Residents have alleged that while the civic body should take action in the area where the crime was committed, they were removing houses of owners of just a few cattle.
 
 “These are baseless allegations. Action will be taken in all areas where similar problems exist,” Chouhan said.
 
 While IMC provided flats to residents affected in previous demolition drives, the civic body has decided that it would not be the case this time.
 
 While the IMC has been taking action against   owners and their houses in the city, there have been no improvement in the countless number of stray cattle on roads and can still be seen wandering across the city. 
 
 Along ring road, people complained that cattle were slowing down traffic. In most areas, cattle were seen sitting on pavements and dividers of roads.
