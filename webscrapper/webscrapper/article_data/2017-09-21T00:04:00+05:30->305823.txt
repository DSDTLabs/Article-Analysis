Madurai: The organs of a 53-year-old man who died in an accident have been donated in a cadaver transplant performed at the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre.

 Peter Savariraj of Oddapidaram in Tuticorin had met with an accident when he was travelling on his two-wheeler on Bye-pass road in Tuticorin. He was brought to the hospital in Madurai, where he was declared brain dead. Doctors at the hospital told his son Johnson about organ donation, as his father’s eyes, heart, kidneys and liver were in good condition. Johnson agreed to donate his father’s organs after he was told that his father would live in six other people as a result. 
 
 Permission to transplant the organs was obtained from the authorities concerned and the organs were harvested in a five-hour operation. One kidney was donated to a patient in the hospital itself, while another was sent to Trichy Apollo Hospital. The heart was sent to a patient at a Chennai hospital, while the eyes were donated to Aravind Eye Hospitals, Madurai. TNN
