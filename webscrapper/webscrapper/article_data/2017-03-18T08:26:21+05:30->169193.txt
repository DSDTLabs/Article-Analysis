MYSURU: Residents of Mysuru will soon have a platform to air their grievances regarding the cityâ€™s  . 

 If everything goes according to the plan of city police, Mysuru will form a traffic advisory body comprising officials from the departments concerned who will hear grievances from public about traffic. This will be another effort of city   to tackle traffic challenges in Mysuru. 
 
 At present, traffic grievances meetings are conducted at all traffic police stations on the third Saturday of every month. At such meetings, inspectors of the respective stations directly hear the grievances from public between 11am and 1pm and also take suggestions from them as to how to improve traffic in the neighbourhood. The initiative was started when M A Saleem was the city police chief two years ago. 
 
 City cops currently want to involve officers from other departments to have a holistic approach to traffic problems like decongesting junctions by evacuating vendors and streamlining parking. Though the new advisery committee is similar to the existing District Road Safety Committee, which is headed by the deputy commissioner, police claim that it would mainly focus on issues in the city. The road safety committee periodically reviews the safety scenario in the entire district. 
 
 A major complaint against city traffic police is the absence of policemen at intersections, which is leading to traffic indiscipline. Road users claim men in white clothes have shifted their focus on implementing traffic laws, especially the helmet rule, instead managing traffic which is their primary duty. Police, however, say that the city has five police stations for one million population. The sanctioned strength is meagre, but they trying their best to improve the traffic scene, they claim.
 
 City police commissioner A S Rao said that they are in the process of planning an exclusive body for traffic to take a closer look at the problem and make an honest attempt to address the same.
