BENGALURU: Getting to school is quite a task for the students of the   in Shivajinagar; they have to navigate through a veritable maze of garbage, debris, parked vehicles and street dogs.

 “This 700-metre stretch is in shambles, there's absolutely no place to walk as the pavements are either broken or have been encroached by street vendors. It's very dangerous for the children who walk to school every day,“ said wing commander (retd) M R  , board member.
 
 In March 2016, the school had sent a letter to the additional commissioner of traffic police highlighting the issues. “Both the sides of the footpath are laden with garbage and filth. The footpath has become an open latrine for people who work in the nearby garages,“ reads the letter which had been signed by the parents of 200 students of the  .
 
 “Cars that have come to be repaired are parked on both sides of the school, the entire road has been occupied by these vehicles. As it is, the roads are narrow and since the pavements are occupied, students and pedestrians are forced to walk on the road.Many accidents happen in this area, in fact, a few members of the school staff have also met with minor accidents,“ said  , principal.
 
 “We received a copy of a memo that had been signed by the then additional commissioner of traffic police saying that cops had been asked to look into the matter and that an action-taken report should be submitted to us. However, nothing has been done. They should at least make sure that no cars are parked near the school compound. The safety of our 1,100 students is paramount,“ she added.
 
 “Garbage is cleared every day, and will never be left on the roads. I will visit the site,“ said Jayasimha, BBMP sub-divisional engineer.
