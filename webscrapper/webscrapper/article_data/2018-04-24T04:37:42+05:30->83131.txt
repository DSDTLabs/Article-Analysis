MUMBAI: Stung by criticism over the delay in implementation of the much-publicised farm loan   scheme, the cooperation department led by BJP politician Subhash Deshmukh has now decided to display the   of beneficiaries in 22,000   offices across the state.

 The final amount to be waived would be Rs 22,000 crore, down from the initial Rs 32,000 crore after a scrutiny of the 56.59 lakh applicants resulted in the number of beneficiaries reducing to 46 lakh. The   number might ride by 4 lakh to 5 lakh.
 
 “We found that while loans worth Rs 20,000 crore of 46 lakh farmers have been waived, quite a large number of farmers are still in the dark on whether their loans have been waived or otherwise, owing to a communication gap. Now we have decided to put the list of farmers in the gram panchayat office, along with the amount of loan waived,” a government official said on Monday.
 
 The official said that owing to technical problems in several cases there was no message to farmers of their loan having been waived. “It was expected that the   will know the status of his loan by SMS. Then it was found that several farmers had given the same mobile number or the mobile instrument was not in operation. Once the list is up in the panchayat office, the farmer can physically see the list,” the official said.
