BENGALURU: Top long distance runners from 59 countries have assembled in Kampala, Uganda, for the   scheduled on Sunday but there will be no Indian entry in the prestigious meet as the   ( ) chose to skip the event citing lack of quality.

 “We don’t have any athlete who is good enough to compete in the World Cross Country and that’s the reason why we decided to skip the event,” an AFI official told  .
 
 Asked why they didn’t send the best available, he said the Federation feared criticism. “We were pulled up for sending too many athletes to the Rio Games who all returned empty-handed. The ministry would have cleared this trip only if it was no cost to the government,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, experts were critical of the AFI’s decision and felt India’s top athletes lost a golden chance to compete with the world’s best.
 
 “It’s unfortunate that India has not send a contingent as cross country is the best way for athletes preparing for all surfaces - track, road or marathon. It serves a purpose for all. I don’t think they have done the right thing,” a distance running expert said.
 
 “It was a golden chance for our top athletes to compete with the world’s best as there was no entry standard. We had competed at the Asian Cross Country last year and our athletes did well. It was up to the federations to decide whether to send a contingent or not. But then we have never planned for this meet as even now we conduct the National Cross Country on roads!,” another expert added.
 
 At the Asian Cross Country meet in Bahrain last year, India were deprived of at least three bronze medals when AFI fielded just three athletes instead of the mandatory four to be considered for team honours. In the senior women’s section, the Indian team including   finished third behind Bahrain and China but missed out as they fielded just three athletes.
