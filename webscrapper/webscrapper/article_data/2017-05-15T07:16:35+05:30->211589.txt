PUNE: The   at a  , who was arrested on May 5 over complaints of  , is sinking deeper into the quagmire with more   and teachers coming forward with more complaints. 

 Swargate police had arrested the head of department (HoD) of physical education under IPC section 354 (sexual harassment) for allegedly making lewd comments and harassing students and teachers. He was released on bail the following Sunday. Police have taken prohibitory action against him, and college authorities said that they have suspended him pending investigation. 
 
 In addition to the 16 women who had complained against him last week, six statements were recorded by the police, a senior police officer told TOI.
 
 As per the statements, the HoD was in the habit of passing crude comments whenever students used to pass in him in the corridor. Police are investigating the matter. According to the complaint, he would do this to women teachers too.
 
 The college administrator had told TOI that the HoD was also the rector of the boys’ hostel, but it was not known why he would visit the girls’ hostel or pass such lewd comments.
 
 It was learnt that the complainants refrained from approaching college authorities earlier as, ironically, the HoD also was the head of the committee for redressal of women’s grievances. Even had they complained, they felt, he had the authority to overlook the complaints. They even feared the professor would retaliate by tampering with their mark sheets.
