Kubra Sait, the   talks about herself

 
 
 Being individualistic. I wouldn’t necessarily wear what everybody is wearing unless it makes me feel good. I believe in classics. I like keeping it simple, whether its colours, cuts or the outfits I wear. 
 
 
 Zesty. 
 
 
 Lacy lingerie. 
 
 A white shirt, a pair of blue denims, a perfect bikini, a little black dress and a pair of 
 black shoes.
 
 
  Lip balm, hand cream, blush. Also phone, wallet, keys. 
 
 
 My bespoke Shantanu Nikhil sherwani, it’s too special to be given away.
 
 
 - 
 A sparkly outfit. 
 - 
 A black suit.
 Denims and a white shirt. 
 - 
 A well-fitted knee-length dress, with stilettos.
 
 
 Don’t be hungry when you go shopping, but don’t overeat either. Grab what meets the eye. If your heart says no, it’s a no. Don’t overspend. Have budget days and splurge days.
 
 
 You are beautiful, no matter what. Smile from your heart; nothing is more beautiful than a woman who is happy to be herself.
 
 
 Use tape on the corners of your eyes to perfect the winged liner effect. 
 
 
  
 Sneakers with suits. Why try so hard to be cool?
 
 
 When I was younger, all I wore was ill-fitting corduroys with large shirts and caterpillar shoes. I won’t be found dead in them now.
