Chennai: Upholding the appointment of former IIT-K director Anantha Padmanabhan as a member of the   of  , the Madras high court on Wednesday said the court could not find any illegality in his appointment.

 The order comes a day after the advocate general informed the court that the former Chief Justice of India  , who heads the search committee has decided to quit as inclusion of Padmanabhan in the committee has been assailed in the court.
 
 First bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar made the observation while dismissing a PIL moved by the Students Federation of India (SFI) assailing Padmanabhan’s inclusion as illegal.
 
 “After going through the records we found no illegality in the appointment of Padmanabhan as search committee member,” the bench said.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel L Parvin Banu said Padmanabhan was holding the post of professor of eminence in the university when he was nominated as a committee member, which is against the by-laws of the university. He added that Padmanabhan is still obtaining remuneration as a research supervisor. Refusing to accept these contentions, the bench said, “He has resigned from the post of professor of eminence before being nominated to the search committee. The research supervisor post is a post without any remuneration.” 
 
 On Tuesday, the bench raised doubts about the authenticity of the resignation letter of Padmanabhan, as the court found two such letters in the case brief, one with an official stamp and another in a plain paper.
 
 When the PIL was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, the advocate general   produced the original copies of the letter. After perusing the document, expressing satisfaction over its authenticity, the bench dismissed the plea.
