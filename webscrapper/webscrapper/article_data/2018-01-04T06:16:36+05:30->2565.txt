KOLKATA: Officers of   have a tough problem on their hands: finding the registration number of the car into which a woman was whisked and molested on her way back from a New Year’s Eve party. Neither the woman nor her saviours could recall the exact sequence of numbers that made up the car’s registration.

 However, even after a daylong effort and questioning two car owners on the basis of the permutation of the numbers, the cops couldn’t locate the offending vehicle or the owner. “We’ve been trying our best to find the car but haven’t been lucky,” said  , deputy commissioner, south suburban division. When the complaint was taken, the woman gave a car registration number but it was found non-existent. One of the two rescuers, who had chased the car on bike, recalled that it was a silver   and vividly described the driver. But, he couldn’t
 specify the number.
 
 During investigation, the police went to the spot and found a witness who remembered the last four digits of the car’s number — 5440. But no car described by the rescuer had such registration number. Therefore, the cops are charting out a permutation and combination of the available numbers and trying to track a car of the same model.
 
 Investigators called in the woman on Wednesday and asked her for a description of the driver. “My wife couldn’t give a very detailed description as she was still in trauma. Since the man was sitting inside his car, she couldn’t see his face properly,” the woman’s husband told TOI.
 
 Based on the details provided by Prasenjit Dey, one of the two rescuers, police drew a sketch of the man. “He was in his mid 40s, clean shaven and wore a maroon jacket with a pair of ripped jeans. He was around 5 feet and 9 inches tall and was abusing us in Bengali,” said Dey.
