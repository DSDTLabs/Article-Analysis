While the trough extended between Jharkhand, eastern UP and Chattisgarh, moisture from the sea continued to flow inland. “The conditions have remained unchanged over the last few days, causing thundershowers. The trough has been moving very slowly in a northeast direction. But it could move away sufficiently by the latter half of Saturday . Once that happens, thundershowers could stop. As of now, we expect Sunday to be dry ,“ said G K Das, director,   (RMC).
 
 This month has already been declared the wettest March in a decade. Even though pre monsoon showers are not uncommon, they have been exceptionally intense and consistent this week, said the RMC.“Thundershowers begin in March but they are few and far in between. We rarely have consistent showers in the first half of March. But this time, we had a huge low-pressure trough. It was aided by the moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal,“ added Das.
