LUCKNOW: The heart-rending incident at   on Tuesday has once again raised questions on safety of children in schools. 

 Four months after the education department and director general of police issued directives for ensuring safety of students, the school did not follow most. 
 
 Soon after the Gurugram Ryan International School episode, where a class II student was murdered by a senior in the toilet, then DGP Sulkhan Singh had issued directives on September 12. Circle officers and station house officers were instructed to audit schools in their area and prepare a report on security loopholes. However, the audit was not conducted.
 
 ASP trans-Gomti Harendra Kumar said, "We do not have enough manpower to check every school."
 
 The DGP's directives and 10-page order issued by the secondary education department had made installation of CCTV cameras compulsory at main entrance, in classrooms, corridors, waiting hall, principal's office and playground entry.
 
 District inspector of schools (DIOS) said that 24 cameras were found in   but police said less than 10 were functional. Moreover, no CCTV camera was installed in the corridor leading to the toilet.
 
 The directives stated that school authorities should not conceal any facts but Brightland College did not inform the DIOS and admitted the student to   only when a private hospital refused treatment. Schools were also instructed to lodge FIR in such cases but that was not done. 
 
 The DIOS has constituted a committee comprising associate inspector   and Hussainabad Inter College principal Harish Chandra, 48 hours after the incident, to look into the school's measures. 
 
 DIOS   said, "We have sought affiliation documents to see whether the college adhered to norms. We will ask LDA about the college's building plan." 
 
 SSP Deepak Kumar told TOI that an explanation would be sought from CO and SHO concerned and fresh directives would be issued.
