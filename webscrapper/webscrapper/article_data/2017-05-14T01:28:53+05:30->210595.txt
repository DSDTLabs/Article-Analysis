GREATER NOIDA: The proposal to set up an international airport in Jewar will soon be sent for clearance to the steering committee formed by the Union ministry of civil aviation, according to Dr  , chairman,   ( ), on Friday.

 “Once the committee, under the chairmanship of the civil aviation secretary, gives the nod, the application for in-principle approval from the government of India will be moved before YEIDA starts the land acquisition process,” Kumar told TOI. Kumar said that site clearance was the first step for the project. “We expect the site clearance to come through soon,” he said. “I have already had a meeting with the civil aviation secretary in this regard. Once we have the obstacle limitation survey (OLS), which is being conducted, in place by May 30, we will submit the same to the respective authorities for approval,” he said.
 
 Kumar said that things were likely to move very quickly as the state government was serious about putting the project on track. “Though we have reserved 5,000 hectares for the project, once a techno-feasibility study is done for the project, a projection of predicted passenger traffic will determine how much area will be used for the airport. The plan will be to accommodate passenger traffic for the next 50-100 years,” he said. Kumar said he had conducted a survey of the earmarked site for the project on Friday. “Once we have the formal nod, we will start the land acquisition.   are willing to part with their land for the project,” he said.
