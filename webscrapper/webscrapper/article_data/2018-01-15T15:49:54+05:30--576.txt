NEW DELHI: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today lauded his Indian counterpart   as "a revolutionary leader in the best sense of the word" and let him know that he's available for a yoga class with him any time.

 
 Netanyahu, or 'Bibi' as he's fondly called in Israel, also joked that he and his wife were excited to visit Bollywood and see it first hand.
 
 Of course, increased cooperation in cinema was one among many areas the two leaders had wide ranging discussions about, but for all the world to see 
  and their bonhomie was in full display at a joint press conference in Delhi today. 
 
  reciprocated Netanyahu's compliments and heaped fulsome praise on 'Bibi' for his "generous affection".
 
 "Last year you said you cut bureaucratic red tape with a machete to forge ahead with speed, I'm here today to say that in India we are on our way to doing that as well," said PM Modi.
 
  
  
 
 The PM also talked about his own reputation "of being impatient in getting results" and then revealed an open secret about his friend 'Bibi'.
 
 "An open secret is that I know you are (impatient) too, to do more for your people and quickly," said PM Modi.
 
 Both leaders also announced that they had a wide range of discussions and signed various cooperation deals in cutting edge areas in agriculture, science and technology and defence and security, as well as in people-to-people cultural exchanges to deepen a bond "that goes back a 1,000 years".
 
 Striking a sombre note, Netanyahu talked about both   "knowing the pain of terror attacks". 
 
 "We fight back and we never give in," said Netanyahu, even as he talked of enhanced security cooperation with India.
 
 He said both India and Israel are proud of their resilient democracies. And the safety of their citizens is paramount so they can continue to "say, do and believe whatever they want".
