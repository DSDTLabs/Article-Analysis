COIMBATORE: The one-member judicial commission probing circumstances surrounding former chief minister Jayalalithaaâ€™s death is yet to decide on personal appearance of jailed AIADMK leader   before it.

 Justice   told reporters here on Sunday that the commission has inquired more than 15 people so far. He said the commission would inquire more people in the coming days. The panel had issued summons to Sasikala in December last seeking information and documents pertaining to the hospitalisation and death of Jayalalithaa.
 
 Sasikala, who is serving her prison term in Bengaluru, through lawyer Raja Senthurpaidiann had in turn told the commission that she would file an affidavit only after copies of evidence submitted by other witnesses was given to her. Her lawyer also said he wanted to cross examine the witnesses, before filing the affidavit of Sasikala.
 
 When asked about the summon issued to Sasikala, Arumugasamy, without elaborating, said the petition submitted by her lawyer was still pending.
