BENGALURU: Karnataka, which is hosting the Bharatiya Pravasi Divas (PBD) at the Bangalore   Centre (BIEC) this year, is all set to utilize the platform to have a session on startups. It will help showcase the investment potential of the state, industries minister R V Deshpande told TOI on Wednesday. Excerpts. 

 
 Everyone is aware of Brand Bengaluru. I need not sell anything to the people. It’s a golden opportunity to showcase our strengths; we have included plenary sessions specific to the state. For the first time, PBD will have plenary sessions on startups and Invest Karnataka. We thank the MEA for including these sessions to showcase what the state has to offer to non-resident Indians and those who intend to invest in Karnataka.
 
 
 We have already spoken to the ministry of external affairs and liasoned with the customs and excise officials at the Kempegowda International Airport
 (KIA) to ensure their swift exit on arrival. We have asked the MEA to take care of the exchange of currency for PBD delegates, and have special counters for them. 
 
 
 The helicopters are being arranged by the MEA to ferry Prime Minister  , President  , minister for external affairs   and Portugal PM Antonio Costa. There are four helipads which have been constructed at the venue for landing of these helicopters. The chief ministers from nine states and other dignitaries will travel by road to the venue. All travel arrangements have been made as per protocol.
 
 
 With the top dignitaries flying to the destination, traffic congestion will be minimized. As the event is scheduled over the weekend, traffic will be low and there shouldn’t be much concern. Accommodation is provided for delegates in locations close to the venue.
