AHMEDABAD: The gold market appears to be moving downhill and the fiscal that ended on March 31, perhaps, was the worst spell in seven years. Data from the   indicates that gold imports were at a seven-year low at 62.33 metric tonnes (MT). The imports declined by 25.6% as against FY 2015-16, when 83.86 MT gold was imported in Gujarat. The situation is even worse for silver imports, which also stood at a seven-year low at 36.19 MT in FY2016-17, a decline of 69.8% against the previous fiscal. 

 Gold analysts and jewellers blame the drop in imports on poor demand and an overall sluggish year. "The demand was low throughout the year. For two months, jewellers were on strike to protest the government's decision of imposing 1% excise duty on gold, and there were practically no sales. Consequently, the bullion trade was low as well," said  , president,  .
 
 In March and April last year, when jewellers went on strike for 42 days, gold imports dipped to 0.54 MT and 1 MT in March and April, respectively. It took a long time before demand picked up moderately. In fact, gold imports remained below 2.5 MT till September.
 
 "Demand picked up only during the festive season and later during the wedding season, which is October and onwards. Till then, there was no demand at all due to an overall slowdown and jewellers' strike," said Ashish Jhaveri, member, Ahmedabad Jewellers Association.
 
 While the overall gold imports have declined, they went up marginally by 12.8% in March as compared to 10.15 MT imports in February. "Investors expected a hike in the customs duty with effect from April and therefore made their investments in March, thus leading to the marginal increase in imports from February to March," said a city-based gold analyst.
 
 Even silver imports plunged significantly by nearly 70% this fiscal as compared to the previous fiscal. Sources said that the demand was low because of the fluctuating prices and poor monsoon, as most investors in silver are farmers.
