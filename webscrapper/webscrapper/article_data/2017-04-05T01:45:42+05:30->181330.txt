Lucknow: The 22 crore-odd population of the state consumes a whopping 56 crore litre of alcohol in a year. The financial year closing review done by the   shows that alcohol consumption in UP has been steadily rising over the years. Each person in the state consumed 2.54 litre of alcohol annually last year, up from 2.39 litre in 2015.

 After the apex court order against   vending across  , officials of the department are in a state of dilemma over how to plug the financial losses this fiscal year. The department had been generating second highest   for coffers of the state government, second only to the commercial taxes department.
 
 With decreased liquor rates, the department was racing ahead in the first half of the financial year (2016-2017) to achieve its target of Rs 19,250 crore, a staggering Rs 5,000 crore over the revenue generated in 2015-2016. “Due to the changed scenario, a lot of things had to be put on hold abruptly. Final revenue is yet to be estimated but it will be at par with the previous year. We may also have to return fees to about 1,500 to 2,000 licence-holders in UP,” said Ram Sagar Tiwari, additional excise commissioner.
 
 As the government reiterated on Monday that all liquor shops located near religious places, educational institutes and hospitals should also be shut down, liquor traders are finding it hard to look for suitable spaces.
 
 Out of 8,500 liquor shops, which were hit by the apex court order, 5,500 shopkeepers had shown interest to relocate to places 500 metres away from highways. In Lucknow for instance, Ring Road, which connects Polytechnic and Engineering college via Munshipulia, has been badly hit.
 
 “At least seven shops have been hit by the order on Ring Road. According to the new guidelines, the shopkeepers are finding it difficult to find space on rent. The situation is messed up, and apart from revenue losses, many will be rendered jobless for months,” said chief of Lucknow liquor traders’ union, Sardar S P Singh. Singh’s own model shop located in Thakurganj, a highly congested part of the city, has remained shut for the past five days. Public works department has failed to solve the confusion prevailing over city roads, which have been earmarked as state highways, resulting in closure of 16 wine or beer shops in Old City.
 
 While reviewing the figures, excise department officials found that consumption of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) — whisky, vodka, gin and brandy — went up by 66% last year (from 5.40 crore litre to 9 crore litre), while that of beer was down by 12%. “Rates of IMFL were brought down significantly in March 2016 while that of beer remained untouched largely,” said Lucknow district excise officer J B Yadav.

 IMFL consumption 2016 / 2015 — 9 crore litre / 5.4 crore litre
 
 Beer consumption 2016 / 2015 – 15 crore litre / 17 crore litre
