JAIPUR: The political drama over the fee hike in private schools continued on Thursday when   President   and other   party workers met state Governor Kalyan Singh.

 Khachariyawas had a discussion with the governor about the problems faced by parents and students due to hike of school fee and increased price of uniforms and books. He said, “All this was done illegally by not following the rules mentioned in 2013 and 2016 of Rajasthan School fee control act.   government is siding with the private schools and is not taking any action against them. Due to this, the future of thousands of children seems difficult.”
 
 
 He requested the governor to excercise his authority as constitutional head and give orders to the BJP about the illegal fee hike. However, the governor told the Congress workers that they should directly talk to the education minister about the matter.
 
 While addressing the media,   said that due to the upcoming assembly elections BJP government is going public and asking people for their grievances who in return will get only fake promises. But instead of these promises government should tackle corruption in the education sector and do something about the problems faced by the parents.
 
 Education minister   called this incident and protest by the Congress party a political stunt to demean his party as they have no other issue left. He said, “It has already been cleared by the government that in Rajasthan around 26,000 schools have their fees committee according to the rules mentioned in the Rajasthan School Fee Control Act, 2016.”
