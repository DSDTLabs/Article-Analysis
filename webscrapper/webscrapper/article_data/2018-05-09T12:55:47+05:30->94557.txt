When promotion works for actor Vishal’s ‘Irumbu Thirai’, which is hitting screens on May 11 were on full swing, the crew faced an issue in releasing the film. The Tamil Nadu Distributors are claiming a foul play that a group of distributors are obstructing the release of the film. In a press meet that happened recently, Sridharan Mariadhasan and PT Selvakumar of Krikes Cine Creations have claimed that Arulpathy of Tamil Nadu Distributors Association is forcing the theatre owners to not offer any screens for ‘Irumbu Thirai’.

  Though the actual reason behind the move is not known, it is quite apparent that the   has not had a great relationship with Theatre owners and Distributors Association in the recent past. It was also evident in the Kollywood strike organised by the  , few of the theatre owners and distributors refused to support the strike. We only have to wait and see how ‘Irumbu Thirai’ fares amidst all these issues. The film which is directed by   has   playing the female lead and   as antagonist.
