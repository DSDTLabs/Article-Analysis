LUCKNOW: After its administration closed down four canteens last year, Lucknow   will get three new open-air canteens in the new academic session. 

 In 2017, the university had shut down four of the six canteens catering to students on its campus. While two of the canteens were operating illegally, the other two were shut down following clashes between students and the authorities. The two canteens which are functional are situated at the old campus-one in the science department and the other in the administrative building.
 
 "To offer something new to the students in the new academic session, we would suggest them a concept similar to  .com (an online portal selling tea)," said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh. The construction of the three canteens-one at LU's second campus and two at the old one-has already begun, he added.
 
 The VC also said that the canteens would offer healthy and protein-rich meals for sports students.
