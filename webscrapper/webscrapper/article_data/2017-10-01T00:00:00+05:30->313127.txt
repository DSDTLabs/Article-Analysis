 Karuva Karuva Payale by Shankar Mahadevan and Shashaa Tirupati is a standard Imman number. But the vocalists add more pep to this song with their rendition, making for a good listen. The song is well-composed, what with interesting interludes, including the impressive string session. Though a signature Imman song, this one’s sure to work with the listeners. Usure Usure is soulful song rendered by Ananya Bhat. The lyrics are intense and the tune is just right for this poignant song. The composer has given more prominence to the voice than the tune. And Ananya makes the best use of it by simply taking control over the song. This one’s our pick from the album. 
 
 Olaga Vaayaadi is a peppy folk number. This song, too, has an Imman stamp. While Benny Dayal gives his best to this song, the tune doesn’t really impress. There’s nothing really novel, making it a passable listen. This is followed by the melodious Azhagazhaga. Sung by Pradeep Kumar, who is turning out to the most-wanted singer in this genre, the song has an easy flow. Pradeep takes over with his pleasant voice and Imman adds his touch in the interludes, which only adds to the beauty of this number. This one’s sure to click with the listeners. 
 
 The album ends with Murukkumeesa Maama by Diwakar and Anita Venkat, and has a vintage feel. Sounding more like a street folk, the song has standard beats making it a cloddish listen. Though the singers render it well, the genre is something that may not be liked by many. Though his signature tunes work, Imman could explore more to give the audiences something more novel to listen.
