MUMBAI: A weak stock market due to foreign fund selling, combined with fears of a worsening fiscal situation, pulled the   to a new six-month low on Monday. The Indian currency closed 0.5% (32 paise) lower at 65.12 to a  . Apprehension over the continuous withdrawal of money by foreign funds, mainly because of the US Fed’s decision to start trimming its $4.2-trillion balance sheet next month, also hit sentiment, dealers said.

 So far this month, foreign funds have net withdrawn nearly $704 million from the stock market, although the same has largely been cushioned by a $650-million net inflow from debt. Additionally, strong selling in the secondary stock market with a net outflow of $1.6 billion has been offset to some extent by the net inflow of $991 million through the primary market.
 
 The weakness in the Indian currency was also because of the fear that the government’s proposed economic stimulus could overshoot fiscal targets and force it to borrow more from the market. Such a situation could be inflationary in nature which, in a way, will almost surely keep the central bank from cutting interest rates any further, economists said.
