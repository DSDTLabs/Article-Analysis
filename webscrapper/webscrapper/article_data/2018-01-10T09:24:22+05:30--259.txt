MOHALI: The municipal corporation is going to use a cartoon mascot, besides radio, to promote the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. A local FM channel will air the promos from January 10 onwards, municipal commissioner   has said.

 A 50-second pormo is recorded in the voice of Class-XI girl  , 16, of   (YPS), who has been chosen as mission ambassador. A second promo of 45 seconds will be in the voice of mayor  . “These will be aired in three time slots on FM radio—in the morning, afternoon, and evening. For the voiceover, the students of the YPS are preparing short stories, poems, and jingles based on the public awareness campaign for the country’s cleanliness,” Hans said.
 
 The municipal commissioner said the idea to select a common person over a celebrity as mission ambassador is connect the masses to the campaign. “The eight schoolchildren who will join the campaign will be on a three-month promotional tour to engage the target families and motivating them to adopt the source segregation of waste. The mission ambassador will educate the masses against the hazards of littering roads and parks with plastic waste,” he said.
 
 The MC hopes to make a bigger impact by involving children, and that it is better to catch them young and use them to motivate their parents to adopt the source segregation of waste, a concept that the civic body is struggling to push even after generous investment and distribution of separate dustbins for dry and wet waste.
 
 The missoni ambassador is also doing her IAYP (International award for young people) programme. Community service is a mandatory part of it. She educates students about the need for cleanliness.
