KOZHIKODE: A law college here has issued a notice to one its students for allegedly bringing and   on the campus. The memo, issued by the   of the Bhavan's N A   and Research at Ramanattukara to Sarjas A T, said that by bringing beef to the campus and distributing it to fellow students he insulted the beliefs of a section of people and created a favourable situation to spark   on the campus. 

 "We have come to know that under your leadership beef was brought to the campus on March 20 and it was cooked and distributed. This is an unpardonable offence and you have done it fully knowing that it is not allowed," the principal, prof. T P Rajalekshmy, said in the memo. 
 
 Meanwhile Sarjas, an SFI leader and a former chairman of the college union denied the charge that he had brought beef to the campus. 
 
 The SFI unit had organized a "symbolic protest" on campus against closure of the college canteen, he said. "As part of the protest, we had cooked rice, fish curry, sambar and chicken and distributed it among students. Beef was not on the menu but the college management has raised false allegations against me and we suspect it as part of plan to to uphold the fascist right-wing agenda," Sarjas said. 
 
 The memo also states that Sarjas tried to organize female students to protest against college authorities. He said the students had raised protests over security issues. "The students had staged a sit-in till late in night on March 21 demanding steps to ensure security in the hostel. But the college management has not taken any concrete steps," he said. 
 
 Meanwhile P Parameswaran, director of the academy, said only vegetarian food was allowed in the campus. "We issued the memo after we received numerous complaints against cooking and distribution of non- vegetarian food on campus," he said.
