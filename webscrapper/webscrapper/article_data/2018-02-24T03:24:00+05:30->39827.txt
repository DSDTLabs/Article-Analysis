Panaji: Four flights were diverted at Goa International Airport on Friday after a thick fog at Dabolim obscured visibility and made it difficult for flights to land and take off. One of these was a TUI international charter flight from Manchester. Apart from the diversions, 14 domestic flights were delayed. 

 The disruptions began at around 6am, when visiblity was extremely low (less than 500m). The sole runway at the AAI-operated airport has a Cat-I instrument landing system that requires minimum visibility of 800m. 
 
 “Passengers were advised to check from respective airlines before reaching at the airport to avoid inconvenience,” an Airport Authority of India official said. 
 
 Officials said that two international flights were diverted to Mumbai while the domestic ones went to Bengaluru. Flight 4R8631 from Novosibirsk, Russia, was diverted to Mumbai along with the TUI Airways B788, with British tourists from Manchester. 
 
 “This flight was diverted to Mumbai to refuel, and passengers were taken to a hotel in Mumbai,” a TUI representative said.
 
 Two domestic flights from Chennai — Spicejet SG2891 and Indigo 6E128 — were diverted to Bengaluru before being permitted to land at Goa later in the day. Some of the domestic flights were delayed by four hours.
 
 “Once visibility improved, all delayed and diverted flights were permitted to operate,” the AAI official said. Flights began landing from 8.30am onwards, when visibility improved,” the official added.
