MUMBAI: More than 33% of law papers from the exam held by   in December and January are pending for assessment. Of 76,000 answer sheets, 27,000 have not been assessed yet. On an average, about 700 papers are being assessed daily. So, to complete assessment, teachers could take a month. This will impact the upcoming law exam and also final-year students' careers. 

 Law students set April 7 as the deadline of April 7 for the university's vice-chancellor  . "If it fails to announce all results soon, we will hold a massive protest against the university's inefficiency. We've also demanded exam postponement as there will not be enough time for re-valuation," said  , president, law students' council. 
 
 Law exams are slated to begin on April 18. But the university has decided to postpone exams. A fresh schedule, however, is yet to be released.
 
 The   recently rejected a proposal to get papers assessed from teachers outside Mumbai University.. "Last time, questions were raised about assessment quality. So we're trying to get our teachers to assess. We are getting visiting faculties to assess papers too. But these are practising lawyers who find time only after work hours," said the principal. Another teacher said it would have been easier to complete the backlog if assessment were done offline.
 
 A university official said colleges must assign teachers. "About 700 papers are assessed a day. At this speed, we need 40 more days for pending papers. It appears difficult for the university to hold exams and announce results of final exams on time," said the official.
