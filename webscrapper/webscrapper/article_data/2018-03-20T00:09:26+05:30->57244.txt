Aurangabad: Special trains that were announced from Nanded for the benefit of passengers attending Ajmer Urs in Rajasthan had as many as 1,286 vacant seats by Monday evening.

 The poor occupancy has prompted railway authorities to appeal to passengers to take the benefit of the special train.
 
 Rajesh Shinde, public relations officer of South Central Railway (SCR), Nanded division, said the over 90% seats in the special Nanded- Ajmer-Nanded train were unclaimed.
 
 He said, “While other special trains introduced by SCR authorities for Ajmer Urs have witnessed relatively better occupancy, Nanded- Ajmer-Nanded train has been struggling to attract passengers.”
 
 Railway activist Omprakash Varma, however, blamed SCR authorities for announcing the special trains to Ajmer on such short notice.
 
 Varma said, “Formal announcement of the special trains was made on March 15. It is an incorrect practice to introduce such trains hardly a few days before the actual journey. Passengers cannot plan their tour in such a short time. Ideally, the SCR authorities should announce such special trains at least a month beforehand.”
 
 The special train from Nanded to Ajmer (07641) will depart from Nanded at 4.05pm on March 21 and is scheduled to reach Ajmer the next day at 9.25pm.
 
 The return train from Ajmer to Nanded (07642) will leave from Ajmer at 8.05pm on March 26 and will arrive at Nanded at 1.30am on Wednesday.
 
 The special trains will stop at Purna, Basmat, Hingoli, Washim, Akola, Bhusaval, Jalgaon, Nandurbar, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Godhra, Dahod, Ratlam, Mandsor, Nimach, Chittaurgarh and Bhilwara stations.
 
 These trains will have AC chair car, sleeper class, general second class and brake van cum luggage coaches. Special trains Kacheguda-Madar-Kacheguda, Hyderabad-Ajmer-Hyderabad, Machilipatnam-Vijayawada-Machilipatnam Ajmer Link and Nellore Ajmer Nellore have also been pressed into service by the SCR to benefit pilgrims visiting Ajmer Urs.
