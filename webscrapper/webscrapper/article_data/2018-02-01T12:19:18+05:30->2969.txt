 Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.
