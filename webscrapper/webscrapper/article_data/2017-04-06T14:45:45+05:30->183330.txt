 is 24 (can you believe that!), and is taking   by storm. But if you thought she is just a cool actress, think again. This new girl on the block can give anyone a run for their money when it comes to fashion, and has managed to sweep many off their feet with her ethereal looks. Whether it's ethnic, casual, fusion, or glam-chic, Disha Patani knows how to slay it and here's the proof... 

 1. Disha gave supermodel Gigi Hadid (who also sported this dress once) a tough face-off in this dress. The plunging neckline and high mid slitâ€¦she pulled it off with perfection! 
  
 
 2. She looked the coolest and comfy-est chic in town in this metallic gold skirt and cross strap bustier. 
  
 
 3. Is there anything called floral goals? If not, Disha just invented it! 
  
 
 4. Who looks this hot in casuals, man! 
  
 
 5. A nice dress, perfect make-up and oodles of confidence...isn't that the definition of a fashionista?! 
  
 
 6. Guess, her hourglass figure makes any outfit look drool-worthy! 
  
 
 7. She sashays in ethnic wear, and we just can't stop swooning!
