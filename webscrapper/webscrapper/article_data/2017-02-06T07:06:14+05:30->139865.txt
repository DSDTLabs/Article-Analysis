CHENNAI: After almost a year of planning logistics, setting up facilities, training field workers and allaying fears, the state will on Monday initiate the Centre's mass vaccination drive for measles and rubella. 

 On Sunday, representatives of the   (IAP), WHO and   held a meeting in the city and sent out an appeal to all schools and parents to bring their children for the drive and not be swayed by rumours. In Tamil Nadu, around 1.8 crore children from 9 months to 15 years - nearly a quarter of the state's population - will be vaccinated from February 6 to 28.
 
 In Chennai, officials intend to cover 1.02 lakh children in 135 schools on the first day of the drive. "When we announced the programme, several concerns were raised by parents. But with IAP and other doctors' bodies backing the drive, people are more convinced," said K Kolandaswamy, Director of Public Health. The drive will cover around 16 lakh children in the city. From February 6 to 16, the camps will be held in government, private and aided schools. 
 
 In the later phase, the programme will be extended to anganwadi centres, health sub-centres and mobile posts in villages and urban areas. At least 1,500 doctors and 10,000 nurses, besides anganwadi workers and volunteers, will be involved in the programme. 
 
 Unlike polio vaccine, which is given orally, MR is an injectible. The live, attenuated vaccine will be administered as a 0.5ml dose through an injection on the right arm.
 
 Last year, the state recorded 500 cases of measles - the lowest in 30 years. Through this programme, officials hope to completely wipe out the virus from the community. The programme is the first phase of the vaccination drive by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep will be covered in this phase. 
 
 The drive will be introduced in other states in a phased manner. Children will receive the combination vaccine at least twice before they enter school.
