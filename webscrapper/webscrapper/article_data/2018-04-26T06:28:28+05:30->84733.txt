NEW DELHI: Traffic congestion during peak hours in four major cities — Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru — costs the economy Rs 1.5 lakh crore annually, according to a study by a global consultancy firm.

 
 The peak hours for this survey were 7-9am and 6-8pm, when commuters spent one-and-ahalf times longer to travel a given distance as compared to nonpeak hours, said the report by  .
 
 The study in January found Kolkata is the worst, so far as congestion is concerned, followed by Bengaluru. Delhi, despite having the maximum number of registered vehicles (little over 10 million), seems to be better because of its good road network, which is about 12% the capital’s total area. On the contrary, Kolkata has barely 6% of its total area under road network. Mumbai tops the list when it comes to using public transport for commuting, followed by Kolkata; it’s worst in Bengaluru.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Urban transport expert Prof N   said: “In Kolkata, private mini-buses are the main mode of transport.
 
 Despite having a high share of people using public transport, Kolkata is congested for reasons such as low share of road network, poor geometrics and huge flow of vehicles in core part of the city.”
 
 According to the report, Delhi has the highest share of 45% of people using their private cars for commuting while in Bengaluru their share is 38%. The survey covered 300 persons from each city.
 
 He added that the situation in Bengaluru is alarming as road network planning is obnoxious, traffic engineering and management is missing and there is blatant misuse of road.
 
 The BCG report prepared for Uber claimed that on average 89% of commuters indicated their plans to purchase a car in the next five years.
