KOLKATA: Chief minister   is livid with the Centre’s dissolving of the   (BIFR) and its appellate body (AAIFR). 

 “I can understand the plight of the workers of the sick units whose cases are pending in the BIFR because I had pleaded for their cause. What will be the fate of those cases? They say workers have to start the cases afresh. Just imagine their plight. Some of them can’t engage lawyers to fight their cases,” the CM said, adding that the Modi government is dissolving all old institutions that form the backbone of the country.
 
 “I am not saying institutions do not need to be upgraded or modernized. But what’s the point doing away with them? The PM did the same thing with the   and replaced it with  . What kind of plans will it undertake when the government doesn’t have any policy,” the CM said. 
 
 She was reacting to a letter from the ministry of corporate affairs to the chief secretary on January 2, announcing the dissolution of BIFR and AAIFR. The ministry of corporate affairs, in its letter, states cases pending before the BIFR and AAIFR “stand abated.” Instead, companies can file fresh cases for insolvency resolution under the new National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The Centre maintains the decision will “result in greater efficiency in resolution of insolvency of companies.” 
 
 INTTUC president   also expressed concern about the workers of sick industrial units in the state. “We do not know what would happen in the absence of BIFR. We have to go through the deails of the new law. The new law will expedite liquidation of the sick companies which is against the interest of the workers,” he said. J Chatterjee, a a vateran Citu leader of Hindustan Motors also strongly criticised the move.
