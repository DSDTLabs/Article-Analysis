 Only intake of fruits is not important, the proper time and the method of their eating should also be kept in mind, advised a nutritionist.
 
 According to diet experts, fruits have a specific characteristic according to which they should and should not be taken. 
 
 While some combinations of fruits are harmful for our system, some fruits should be restricted to a certain time of the day. 
 
 “Watermelons, which are eaten by many during the summer, should not be eaten with any other fruit or even with meals as it has high water content which dilutes the gastric acids in our stomachs and inhibit the process of digestion. Morning is the best time to intake citric fruits like oranges, grapes, lemons etc. Also, it is advisable to take fruits as appetizer and not as an accompaniment during meals,” said a dietician Dr Abha Agrawal.
