MUMBAI: A suspended   officer is in a critical condition after attempting suicide by jumping before a running train at   station on Monday. While one of his legs was severed, the other was crushed. He was to be questioned later that day in connection with a theft reported at the   railway workshop.

 
 Ramesh Meshram, 51, was attached to the Matunga RPF outpost as a sub-inspector and lived in Kalyan. Around 12.43pm, he walked onto Kurla’s platform 1 and jumped before a down Titwala local. The motorman braked as soon as he saw Meshram but the train had already knocked him down by then. A profusely bleeding Meshram was rushed to Sion Hospital. He had lost consciousness.
 
 On December 29, 2017, a theft was reported at the Matunga railway workshop.   grabs showed a truck entering the workshop and exiting later. An investigation by the RPF found a constable had connived with the thieves. The constable was placed under arrest on Sunday. During interrogation, he spilled out names of a few people involved in the crime, including that of Meshram. 
 
 On January 4, Meshram was suspended. Meshram had been summoned for interrogation on Monday. However, before he could be quizzed, he attempted to end his life. “As soon as he regains consciousness, we will ask him what prompted him to attempt the drastic step,” said DCP (GRP) Samadhan Pawar. “We have asked the RPF for CCTV footage of Kurla’s platform 1 where the incident was reported.”
 
 When contacted, senior RPF officials said Meshram was undergoing surgery at Sion Hospital. RPF suspects railway parts were stolen from the Matunga workshop, but the quantity and worth of the loot is yet to be ascertained. “We are trying to verify with our stores department. It is possible Meshram took the step out of anxiety,” a senior official said.
