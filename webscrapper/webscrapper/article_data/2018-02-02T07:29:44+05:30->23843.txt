Air pollution due to stubble burning is a big   in north India. With the Budget announcement of a scheme to provide   for in situ management of  , the problem will only be partially addressed.

 Though UP government has banned biomass burning, the practice continues as farmers have no other way to clear the fields.
 
 As of now, these machines cost Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakh, making them unaffordable for farmers. The subsidy will make it easier for them to buy the equipment. The Budget, however, does not mention the amount allocated for the subsidy.
 
 Experts said the scheme will benefit only Punjab, Haryana, Delhi-NCR and UP, as has been mentioned in the Budget, but there are several other states that have high air pollution.
 
 Sunil Dahiya, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace India, said, “Delhi-NCR is undoubtedly one of the most polluted regions but our recent report on air pollution shows that more than 80% cities in India are severely polluted. The Budget should have addressed the need to increase monitoring stations across the country.”
 
 “Subsidised machines would help reduce pollution due to biomass burning but that is only one cause of air pollution. We urge the government to make extra budgetary provision for a clean air action plan,” said Ramapati Kumar, CEO of Centre for Environment and Energy Development.
