GREATER NOIDA:   Prabhat Kumar, who is also the divisional commissioner  , on Tuesday said he would write to the Uttar Pradesh government to expedite the land acquisition process for the Noida international airport in Jewar. 

 Kumar said he would request the state government to part with about Rs 200 crore for the purpose from the budgetary provision of Rs 400 crore allotted by UP in the 2017-18 budget announced on June 11, for giving a facelift to airstrips in the state.
 
  Kumar said he would soon write to the state government for the disbursement of the funds at the earliest. 
 
 “During the budget, it was announced that the funds would be used for land acquisition for Jewar airport. Once we have the funds, we will be able to start the land acquisition process, which is a lengthy procedure,” he said, adding, “We have to acquire 3,000 hectares of land for the first phase of the aviation project. We have already started the process of changing the land use in the Master Plan-2031.”
 
 Kumar said that YEIDA has also written to the state government seeking additional staff for the Authority as a dedicated team will be required to complete the task of buying the land and resettling farmers. The process of selecting the company that will build the airport will also take place alongside the acquisition process. The project is to be developed on the public-private partnership model.
