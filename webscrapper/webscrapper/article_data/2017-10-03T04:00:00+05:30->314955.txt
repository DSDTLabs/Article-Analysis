 According to police, the burgled house belongs to Chrirag Vaishnav in Krishnakunj Society-2 behind Chhotunagar on Raiyya Road. Vaishnav serves as the assistant to public prosecutor. 
 
 “Vaishnav had gone on a pilgrimage to Mataji temple in Kutch with his wife and two sons, leaving his 65-year-old mother Urmila Vaishnav alone at home. The family had left on Saturday as Vaishnav had a two-day holiday, during which time the theft occurred. 
 
 While Urmila slept on the ground floor, the burglars broke into the upper floor of the house and committed the theft,” said an official from Gandhigram police station where the case in this connection has been registered. 
 
 The burgled items include gold jewellery worth Rs 1.35 lakh and cash totaling to Rs 3.5 lakh, the official added.
