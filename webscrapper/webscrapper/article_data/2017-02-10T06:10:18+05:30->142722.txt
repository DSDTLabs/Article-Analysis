AHMEDABAD: The   (DoPT) on Thursday sanctioned a total of 8 more   posts for  . Two of these are DGP-rank posts, one of additional DGP-rank and 5 SP-rank cadre posts. Sources said that with the increase in cadre posts, transfer and promotion of IPS officers are likely soon. 

 Senior IPS officers said that under normal circumstances, cadre review takes place every five years but this time it has taken more than a decade for the DoPT to review the cadre posts for IPS officers in Gujarat.
 
 Earlier, Gujarat had two cadre posts and two non-cadre posts for DGP rank.
 
 “Now two more IPS officers can be promoted to the rank of DG,” said an IPS officer. “The government is expected to upgrade the cadre post of additional DGP (Prisons) to DGP rank but no decision has been taken about the other DGP post.”
 
 He further said that sanctioning of cadre posts surely means that the state will have more IPS officers. “However, the state can create an equivalent number of non-cadre posts against the sanctioned cadre posts,” said an IPS officer.
 
 Currently, there are four DGP-rank officers in the state. “PP Pandey is the main DGP. HP Singh is DG Home Guards and Civil Defence; Geetha Johari is DG, Police Housing Corporation; and Pramod Kumar is DG, SRP,” said an official of the state home department.
 
 Sources said senior IPS officers of the state were pressing for cadre review for long. “The state home department had also written several times to the Union home ministry to recommend additional cadre posts for Gujarat,” said a senior police official.
 
 Sources in the police said that about five months back, additional DGP Mohan Jha had a meeting with officials of Union home ministry to recommend additional cadre posts. “Last month, in charge DGP PP Pandey met DoPT officials regarding increase in cadre posts of IPS in the state,” said a senior police official.
