NEW DELHI: A day after a 22-year-old man was killed by a wire tied to a  , police have instructed beat staff to ensure that barricades aren’t left haphazardly on the roads, especially at entry points of colonies. Guidelines to this effect would also be issued. 

 An inquiry has been started to establish the role of the officers present at Netaji Subhash Place police station at the time of incident. 
 
 Beat officers have been told to remove barricades and place them parallel to roads to prevent vehicles or bikers from ramming them. Barricades put up post midnight to block roads must be chained up instead of being tied with wires or ropes. 
 
 The SHOs have been instructed to ensure that if a road needs to be blocked, adequate number of barricades are sourced from other places in the district. 
 
 “Constables and head constables in charge of putting up barricades have also been asked to be mindful about the possibilities of an accident after putting up a barricade,” said a senior police officer.
 
 While probing the incident at Shakurpur JJ colony on Thursday, police found that usually the beat officer installed four barricades to prevent entry of vehicles on the stretch. On Wednesday night, only two remained since the others were towed away to be put up elsewhere. “The person who had put it up had created a barrier with the wire to stop miscreants involved in stealing two-wheelers from the markets around the area,” said a police officer. 
 
 Police are trying to find out who had been deputed to man the barricades and where the other two barricades were taken. 
 
 Police have also appealed to the government to pay compensation to the victim, Abhishek Kashyap. Sources said efforts were being made to provide a job to the victim’s sister Priyanka.
