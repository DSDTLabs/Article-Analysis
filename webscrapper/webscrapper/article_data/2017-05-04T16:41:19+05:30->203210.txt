KOLHAPUR: Investigations have been asked to start by the   Tararani Aghadi and   ( ) in the alleged Kalammawadi Direct Pipeline Project scam.

 On Tuesday, the parties wrote a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis asking to start investigations about the cost of the project and more. 
 
 Tararani Aghadi corporator, Satyajeet Kadam said, “We have written a letter to the chief minister’s office along with all the documents proving the irregularities in estimating the cost of the project and the clearance of the bills. We have asked him to set up an enquiry committee to investigate the scam. The wrong estimates will cost heavily to the public.”
 
 Corporators of the civic administration had recently alleged that all the bills of Rs 2.5 crore have been cleared for an iron bridge, which costs Rs 25 lakh in the market. The opposition claimed that about 20 such bridges have been proposed along the 52km stretch of the pipeline project and will cost Rs 20 crore. 
 
 The civic authorities refuted the claims, but accepted that the bills were cleared mistakenly. So, the opposition in the letter has claimed that the tendering process be investigated as the estimates were hiked during the process. 
 
 Even the ruling   (NCP) has supported the claims of the opposition and blamed the civic authorities for faulty estimates and alleged irregularities.
 
 “We have seen how the faulty project of   cost the public heavily as several leakages are reported every week and a huge sum of money has already been spent on it. We do not want similar things to be reported about this project as the Kalammawadi project will be helpful in providing clean water to the citizens for the next 30 years,” added Kadam.
