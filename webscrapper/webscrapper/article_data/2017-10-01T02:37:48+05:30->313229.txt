JOSHIMATH ( ): Union home minister Rajnath   said on Saturday that people living along the India-China border are “strategic assets”, and urged them not to migrate from bordering villages which would out India’s security at risk.

 The home minister, who is on a four-day visit to forward border outposts on India-China border, said that “it won’t be good from border security point of view if our brothers and sisters living on borders migrate from there”.
 
 Uttarakhand, which shares around 350km long border with China, has been facing major problem of people leaving their homes in the hills due to lack of employment and basic facilities like education and health care.
 
 In a statement last year, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had said that “we need civilian population in border villages to ensure there is no Kargiltype situation”.
 
 Addressing locals and   troops, Singh said the border people are strategic assets and “should be given more importance”.
 
 The border population is strategically important as it can provide timely intelligence about any possible incursion or transgression by enemy forces,” a border security officer told TOI.
 
 “PM   thinks about you (border population). He keeps on telling me that we have to take care of you,” Singh told the locals. Singh asked ITBP to develop friendly relations with the local population and continue its civic action programmes to build confidence among them. Earlier, Singh visited two forward BoPs (border out posts) — Rimkhim and Lapthal — near China border.
