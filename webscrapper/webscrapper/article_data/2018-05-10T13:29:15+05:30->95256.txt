NEW DELHI: In what could come as a big relief to lakhs of commuters heading towards   taking the   route, NHAI today opened a new   through  . 

 
 The new slip road will cut down the travel time and huge wastage of fuel. Traffic pile up has been a common site since traffic coming to four lanes towards IGI used to negotiate with only two lanes at Parade Road crossing. 
 
  
  
 "After getting land from the defence ministry, we built the slip road inside the Subroto Park boundary. The new boundary has been built after completing the slip road. We hope this will improve traffic flow," said an NHAI official.
  
  
 The project to make the stretch signal free for traffic has been taken up by the NHAI and it has set a stiff deadline of April 2019. The work has been delayed due to green clearances.
