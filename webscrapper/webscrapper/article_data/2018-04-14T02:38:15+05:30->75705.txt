NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi Police’s   registered a   into the theft of   from a  , it has emerged that the   got its hands on almost 90% of the bitcoins   with the firm at that point. 

 A team led by additional DCP (Cyber Cell) K P Malhotra has started going through the servers of the company to determine the extent of the damage due to the hack. 
 
 Senior officers said the role of the chief security officer, Amitabh Saxena, was under scanner. Saxena, who was responsible for keeping the private keys secured, detected the theft.
 
 “As the private keys were kept with him, we feel that he is making a false story to divert our attention and he might have a role to play in this entire incident. The incident reported by Saxena does not seem convincing,” read the FIR filed by the company. Saxena’s passport has been temporarily suspended. The role of some other senior-level employees are also being probed. 
 
 Officers said the timing was intriguing as the exchange didn’t have much cryptocurrency in its wallet then. If the hackers had the private keys for 12 hours, they could have got away with more bitcoins, cops indicated.
