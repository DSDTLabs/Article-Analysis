MEERUT: To clear the deck for a hassle-free rally of Prime Minister   in the city on Saturday, BJP chief   on Friday met a group of lawyers, who are on a warpath for the past several years seeking a separate bench of Allahabad high court in west UP.

  About 10,000 lawyers had planned to reach the Prime Minister’s rally venue on Saturday to hold a protest against what they call the “indifference” of the government towards their long-standing demand.
 
  Shah met with the agitating lawyers and assured them that their demands will be considered.
 
  “Amit Shahji called us for a meeting and asked us not to protest. He also asked us to give our names, with demands, to our local MP and assured that within a week the Prime Minister will meet us.
 
  “He also assured us that our demands will be considered. Now, we will not protest tomorrow,” said  , president of Meerut Bar Association.
 
  But, Singh warned that “if we don’t get to meet the PM within seven days, we will start the agitation again.”
 
  The demand for a high court bench in Western UP is long-standing and dates to 1955, when Dr. Sampurnanand, the then chief minister of the state had recommended a bench be set up in the region, preferably in Meerut.
 
  “The problem is that the Allahabad high court has the highest number of pending cases. The pressure is huge. Allahabad is also very far from Western UP. It is around 800 kms from  . Eight other high courts are closer to western UP, and interestingly Lahore high court is closer than Allahabad High court.
 
  The cost of travelling to Allahabad, and then staying there is huge for poor people,” Singh said.
