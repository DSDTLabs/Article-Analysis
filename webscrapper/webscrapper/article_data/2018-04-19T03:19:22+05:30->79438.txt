GURUGRAM; Union minister and Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh on Wednesday wrote to home minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, seeking a   inquiry against cops who “wrongly framed” four youths in the   gang   and double   case. 

 The move comes a day after the Punjab and Haryana high court extended their interim bail for another 28 days.
 
 He also sought strict action against the cops, saying they arrested the four innocent men in haste and ruined their lives. 
 
 On August 2016, a Muslim man and his wife were beaten to death and their two nieces were raped by a gang of four armed men in Dingerheri village. Singh said after the crime, cops arrested the four youths by branding them cow vigilantes.
 
 His letter read, “Some leaders gave a communal colour to the case in the name of representing minority interests, and cops arrested four youths within four days of the crime. Villagers have alleged the cops nabbed the youths and named them as accused in haste.”
 
 CBI took over the investigation on December 5, 2016. The case took a new turn when the Gurugram crime branch arrested four members of the ‘axle gang’ on September 13, 2017, and they confessed to the Dingerheri crime. 
 
 On March 7, the high court granted interim bail to the four youths arrested by police after CBI submitted they were wrongfully arrested. 
 
 At the time, Inderjit had promised to write to the home minister for an inquiry. Now, he also wants the errant cops to be punished so that such mistakes are not repeated in the future.
