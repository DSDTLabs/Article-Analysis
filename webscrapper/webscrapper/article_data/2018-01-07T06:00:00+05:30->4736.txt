KOLKATA: From an ‘absolutely ominous precedence’ to ‘being a threat to documentary filmmaking culture in India’, the city’s intelligentsia has shot back in no uncertain terms to criticize the   decision to not allow Nobel laureate   say ‘Gujarat’ in ‘The Argumentative Indian’.

 Harvard professor and   mentor group chairman Sugata Bose, who was also interviewed for this documentary, said he would not accept this cut. “This is clear violation of the freedom of expression. I would not accept this cut. It sets a very bad precedent for filmmakers having to negotiate with the chairman of the board to get their films cleared,” Bose said. 
 
 According to Sanal Kumar Sasidharan, the director of the controversial ‘S Durga’, the problem is with the system and not with individuals. “I don’t know if they respect to our constitution that gives us freedom of expression or know about the stature of Amartya Sen. Earlier people thought Pahlaj Nihalani was doing things. Today, we see the same thing happening with   at the helm. Actually, people who look approachable, democratic and secular are appointed for their posts now. But these people are only there to carry out orders for the system”
 
 Scholar Swapan Chakraborty described this as an “absolutely ominous precedence”. “The entire episode has to be condemned. But let’s not forget that we have seen other governments also doing such things,” Chakraborty said. 
 
 Rakesh Sharma’s ‘Final Solution’, a documentary that presents the 2002 Gujarat riots, was initially denied a certification by CBFC but it went on to win two awards at the 54th Berlin International Film Festival. The CBFC finally cleared the film in 2004 and it went on to win a National Award. Commenting on CBFC’s hyper-sensitivity, he said, “This is an absurd exhibition of loyalty to the Emperor by the CBFC ‘darbaris’.”
