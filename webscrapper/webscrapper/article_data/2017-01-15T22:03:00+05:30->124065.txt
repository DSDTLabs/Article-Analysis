Meerut: Abul Qasim Nomani, the vice chancellor of Darul Uloom seminary in Deoband, has come down heavily against reports that claimed that the iconic 19th century Islamic seminary had banned entry of all politicians on its premises.   “We cannot close our premises to any visitor. We had only said that we will not interact with any politician. Media has twisted my statement completely. We had taken this stand not to interact with representatives of political parties in order to prevent any misunderstanding at a time when political atmosphere is highly charged. We are an educational institution and do not want to be dragged into any controversy,” Nomani told TOI.    In the past, it has been a tradition for candidates to pay a visit to Darul Uloom Deoband. Based on the notion that Muslims vote en bloc, visit of candidate was said to cause a swing of votes in the region. The visitors list included stalwarts like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi.    In their bid to avoid any unnecessary controversy during the upcoming polls, the seminary authorities have decided not to interact with the media. “Our stand is very clear on this issue. We are not going to interact with media before or during the election process. We will issue a statement, if need be, after the results are out,” Nomani said.    According to a senior functionary of the renowned seminary, who did not wish to be named, “In the past, we have unnecessarily been dragged into political controversies which shows our iconic institution in a bad light.”
