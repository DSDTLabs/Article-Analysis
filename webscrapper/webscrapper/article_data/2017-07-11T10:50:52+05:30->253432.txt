PANAJI: The public works department (PWD) has awarded the   audit work of all bridges in Goa to an agency that has to submit its report within six months of commencing the same. 

 “The safety   work is likely to be completed in six months. Since the monsoon has begun, the study is likely to be started after the rains recede slightly,” a PWD official said. 
 
 The department has remained confident of the structural strength of Goan bridges despite the incident at   where two people lost their life after an old   collapsed. PWD will also commence with its biannual safety checks of all the bridges in the state. The examination is conducted pre-monsoon and post-monsoon to check the deck slab levels, corrosion and other changes in the bridge conditions.
