CHENNAI:   are   in the   estuary after nearly four decades thanks to the efforts of the Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT) which launched an initiative to plant these natural bioshields more than two years ago. 

 What was once an area infested by prosopis julifora shrubs now wears a new look, teeming with over 20,000   plants adapted to life in harsh saline conditions. The invasive prosopis which had spread over 40 acres of land on eight islands was cleared before planting the mangroves, a CRRT official said. The estuary begins from the Adyar bridge and joins the   near the Quibble Island cemetery at Foreshore Estate. The creek and estuary put together measure 300 acres and ecological restoration was taken up along the entire stretch. Planting of mangrove saplings in the estuary began in November 2015, he said. 
 
 “Nearly 2,000 saplings were planted at the time. However, they were destroyed in the floods in December that year. The CRRT had to restart the planting of mangrove saplings after the area recovered. A total of 22,000 mangrove saplings were planted and the place now attracts a large number of birds, especially egrets,” the official said. 
 
 Botany professor D Narasimhan said mangroves were a common sight on the Chennai coast four decades ago, along the Ennore creek in the north, Adyar creek and estuary area and   creek in the south. They can still be seen along the Buckingham Canal. 
 
 The Adyar estuary ecosystem has diverse vegetation including mangroves, psammophytes (plants found in sandy regions), freshwater plants and dry evergreen forest plants, said former Zoological Survey of India director K Venkataraman.
