Panaji: GFP leader and town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai, on Wednesday, said that his party would block the entry of the sixth casino in the Mandovi river. Speaking after the party’s executive meeting, Sardesai said that he is against having offshore vessels in the Mandovi river and would prefer that the casinos to be moved on land.  “We have never been anti-casino per say, but we want to move them out of the Mandovi river. We will oppose the entry of the sixth casino and I am personally against it. We want to remove all casinos from the river and I am personally pushing to move them from there to land,” Sardesai said, adding that the vessels are polluting the river.  While in the opposition, Sardesai had vociferously opposed the entry of Kanda’s casino into the Mandovi and had also accused BJP of being pro-casino.  Further saying that the outright banning of casinos is not feasible for the state’s economy, Sardesai said, “We need to amend the Acts as these casinos are polluting the whole river. The whole riverfront can instead be converted on the lines of the Hong Kong harbour where there are daily laser shows. Casinos should not be shutdown because then we are closing many other things,” he said. Sardesai was joined by Saligao MLA and housing minister Jayesh Salgaonkar who said that he written to the captain of ports regarding the entry of the new casino.  “I have written to the captain of ports to not allow the new vessel to anchor near the banks close to my constituency,” Salgaonkar said.
