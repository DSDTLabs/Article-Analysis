NEW DELHI: Indian intelligence agencies are keeping a close watch on the developments in the valley through Sunday in the wake of what is being observed as a “Kashmir Day” in Pakistan.

 Several parts of Jammu and Kashmir have been placed on high alert amidst inputs of Hizbul operatives attempts to disrupt peace.
 
 On Saturday, Hafiz Saeed led terrorist outfit Jamat ud Dawa, which changed its name to   and Kashmir (TAJK), was found circulating videos, having provocative images of violence in the valley to incite youths to gang up against Indian armed forces.
 
 One of the videos accessed by TOI carries a logo of Radio Pakistan and is titled "Haan mai wo kashmir hoon, wo ujdi hui jageer hoon." It has pictures of parents of children allegedly killed in the valley and their mother's accounts.
 
 There are functions organised at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Lahore, Islamabad, Mirpur, Muzzafarabad, and other parts of Pakistan and occupied areas. India's external agencies are keeping a close watch on the happenings.
 
 Munawar Hasan from Jamaat-e-Islami, Sajid Mir from PML-N, Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki From Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jamat Ud Dawah, Samiul Haq from Jamaat Ulema-e-Islam, Ghulam Mohammad Safi of Hurriyat Conference, Hafiz Saifullah Mansoor from JuD and Hafiz Khalid Waleed, son-in-law to Hafiz Saeed are some of the people expected to attend the congregations.
 
 Agencies suspect even Saeed could also attend one of the programmes despite his house arrest. If not, he will make his presence felt through a telecast speech.
 
 Radio Pakistan, it has been learnt, appealed to observe a one minute silence at 10am on Sunday to "express solidarity" with those who died fighting for "Kashmir's freedom".
 
 On Saturday, several Twitter handles were posting provocative messages in order to mobilise support for Sunday. Agencies are reporting them to Twitter.
