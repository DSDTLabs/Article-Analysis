 “I believe the distinction must be based on good and bad human beings,” she says. “I don’t see gender when I look at the world. I have met fantastic men in my life and horrible women. I have also met some amazing women and terrible men. I have seen women who are sexists. So, you can’t bring gender into it as it becomes gross. That’s not how it works.”
