SURAT: Six-seater electric auto rickshaws (e-autos) with solar panels on the top will be seen plying on Surat roads in next three months time. This will be part of the e-rickshaw project of   (UCD) of   (SMC).

 Running on chargeable lithium-ion batteries, the rickshaws can get a full recharge within in 1.5 hours. After being fully charged, the rickshaw can cover distance up to 90 km. SMC plans to introduce 15-30 e-autos in the first phase and has identified first batch of beneficiaries who will operate these vehicles. More autos will be added after assessing the response from the people.
 
 After the successful implementation of Pink Auto project in the city to create awareness on women employment, the UCD department under its Corporate Social Responsibility ( ) programme has undertaken this e-rickshaw project. 
 
 Gayatri Jariwala, assistant commissioner, SMC said, “This project is for sustainable urban mobility through clean vehicles under the Surat Smart City project. It would be useful for providing last mile connectivity to people in different areas and help cut pollution.”
 
 “These e-autos will be little bigger that conventional rickshaws with seating capacity of six people. It will have a maximum speed of 30-40 km per hour and would cost around Rs 1.75 lakh,” said Jariwala.
 
 SMC will also set up charging stations at four locations for the rickshaws.
 
 SMC has sent a proposal to CSR Gujarat Authority and is hopeful of getting funding from them for these stations.
 
 As an additional feature, the e-autos will be fitted with solar panels on top that would recharge the batteries to some extent on the move.
