When celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwaker tells you that mangoes are safe for diabetics, you dance with joy. The magician behind Kareena Kapoor’s post pregnancy weight loss is now a household name, thanks to her easy-to-follow diet tips. Since Rujuta has made it evident that she is pro-local foods, her latest post on social media talks about the king of fruits: Mangoes! Here are some basic tips she shared to debunk major myths regarding our summer favourite:  "You can consume mangoes in the form of pickle, aamras, panna or simply eat the slices,” says Rujuta. Since mangoes are something we have grown up eating, it cannot do any harm to our body.   Mangoes have nutrients, which help accelerate fat burning. “Rather than thinking that mangoes are fattening, remember that foods which are not local are way more fattening,” says Rujuta.  Rujuta talks about how mangoes have minerals, which make leptin sensitivity work well in our body. Leptin is a hormone which the body secretes as a response to the food that we eat. If we eat mangoes, our brain gets a signal to start eating in moderation. Rujuta further talks about how eating mangoes in summers will help us regulate our meals for the rest of the year.
