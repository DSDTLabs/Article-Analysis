HYDERABAD: In a country where the gender divide manifests itself in almost all aspects of social life, access and ownership of   too is no different. A recent survey undertaken by the Union ministry of women and child development has revealed that only 63.1% women in urban areas of Telangana use their own mobile phones.

 The figures are poorer in rural areas, with only 33.8% women having access to mobile phones. The urban and rural statistics for the neighbouring state of   were 54.1% and 27.8% respectively. Both the states figure poorly in this regard when compared to other states.
 
 “The traditional roles of men and women are a factor in fewer women owning mobile phones. Cultural restrictions can delay or even prevent a woman from owning a phone,” said Sumitra, a women’s rights activist.
 
 Access to phones in today’s connected world, however, aids in the empowerment of women. “I have noticed that women feel more independent when they have mobile phones and are financially independent. Women also have access to better opportunities with a mobile in hand,” said V Sandhya of the   (POW).
 
 But choice is not always at women’s disposal. Factors such as household income, age, level of education too play a major role in deciding whether women own a phone or not. 
 
 Nonetheless, the situation seems to be much better in the seven sister states in the North East. Sikkim tops the list with 89% women in urban areas having mobile phones, followed by Mizoram (88%), the hill state of   (85.4%) and Arunachal Pradesh (82%).
 
 In the south, Kerala is on top with 81% women in urban areas owning mobile phones followed by Tamil Nadu (70.1%) Telangana (63%), Karnataka (62.3%) and AP (54.1%). Kerala also holds the distinction of having the least difference between mobile phone ownership in urban and rural areas.
