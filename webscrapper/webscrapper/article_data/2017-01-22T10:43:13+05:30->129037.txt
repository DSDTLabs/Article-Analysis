THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The political appetite today is not for conservation, but for growth at any cost, said Congress leader and MP  . He was delivering the Bodheswaran Memorial lecture organized by Bodheswaran Foundation here on Saturday.

 “Growth at all cost and faster growth is the argument in the minds of the political establishments as well as in the media and academic circles. An   minister had sent a message to the officials and to members of environment appraisal committee that priority of government is ease of doing business,” Ramesh said during his lecture on ‘Earth, our only home. Can we save it?’
 
 Mentioning about the   protest, Jairam said it was second most important landmark in the history of conservation of environment in the country, after  . “It was not an easy but unequal fight, where the influential personalities were in opposition of environmentalists. The activists had cultural influence and received exposure, but did not had political influence. In our country nothing gets done if it doesn’t have political influence. Environmental issues are not social and economic, but fundamentally political issue, which is settled in political process,” Ramesh said.
 
 He also recalled the efforts of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and retired foreign secretary KPS Menon in protection of environment, during the days of Silent Valley protest.
 
 Citing the debate on Jallikettu in  , former Union minster for environment and forest said the issue has become a political issue, which was a subject of diversity. Suggesting a broader coalition between political parties as a solution to conservation, he said the political parties have to go back in history and take appropriate lessons.
 
 The event presided over by P Gopinathan Nair was attended by poet B Sugathakumari, CPM leader M A Baby, CPI leader Binoy Viswam, Congress leader V D Satheeshan and BJP state secretary C Sivankutty.
