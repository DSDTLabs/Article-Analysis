Indore: In a meeting chaired by the state’s urban administration and development minister Maya Singh in the state capital, Indore Development Authority raised the demand of tax exemptions and demanded more power to take action. IDA chairman Shankar Lalwani said the development body should not be considered as colonisers. “We are working for the city’s development through various projects. We still have to pay many property taxes, we should be exempted from these to ensure proper functioning and avoid financial crises,” said Lalwani. IDA officials said the body pays a huge sum of money in form of such taxes every year. The body also demanded for more power to deal with encroachments on their land. Lalwani said they should be given the power to independently remove these illegal constructions. This would help them speed up development activities. The chairman also said the development body should be given full right to re-allot property that had earlier been rejected as they did not fulfil certain criteria. Chairmen of Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Ujjain development authorities met the state’s urban administration and development minister Maya Singh in the state capital to explain problems faced by development authorities and progress of various projects. Lalwani had also met the minister last month. He had then raised objections on new land laws and how they were causing problems in development projects. Chairman of the development body had also raised the problem of shortage of staff in IDA. Lalwani had said that the shortage was slowing down development projects.
