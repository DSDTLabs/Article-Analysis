*Indian Space Research Organisation today at 9.28 am launched its   ‘Cartosat-2’ series from Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota.

 *On Thursday, the 28-hour countdown of the   mission, the first one for 2018, kicked off at 5.29am after it got the green signal from  's Mission Readiness Review Committee and Launch Authorization Board on Wednesday.
 
 *The 44.4 metre satellite carries panchromatic and multi-special cameras, operating in Time-Delay Integration mode, which are capable of delivering high resolution data.
 
 *The 100-kg Indian microsatellite will demonstrate a new technology which will allow capturing of images at night and will also provide high resolution scene specific spot imageries.
  
 *The imagery transmitted by the satellite will be related to areas of cartographic, urban & rural applications, coastal land use, road network & monitoring and water distribution.
 
 *This launch will also see Isro taking a shot at a two-orbit feat for the second time — 17 minutes after lift-off, the satellite will enter the 505-km polar sun synchronous orbit and an hour after it goes into its orbit, the microsat satellite will be placed in a lower 359-km orbit.
 
 *It will also carry 30 otherco-passenger satellites belonging to Canada, Finland, France, Korea, UK and USA.
 
 *It is also the first mission after the failure of the PSLV on August 31, 2017, where the heat shield malfunctioned, as a result of which the satellite failed to enter orbit.
 
 *This is the third satellite in the Cartosat-2 series and 42nd flight of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
