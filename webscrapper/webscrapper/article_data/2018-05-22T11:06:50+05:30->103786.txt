GHAZIABAD: BJP MLA from Dibai in Bulandshahr district, Dr Anita Singh  , has received a string of WhatsApp messages, allegedly from Dubai, demanding an extortion of Rs 10 lakh. 

 
 The sender has threatened to eliminate her family members if she did not pay the amount.
 
 The MLA, who lives in   housing society in Vaishali, met SSP Vaibhav Krishna with a complaint on Monday. Krishna has ordered registration of an FIR and directed the crime branch to conduct an inquiry.
 
 According to Dr Rajput, the messages started coming from a mobile SIM card purportedly registered in Dubai, since May 19. An aide of the MLA discovered the messages on Monday after reinstalling the app on the mobile phone.
 
 “The sender has identified himself as Ali Budesh Bhai. He had sent six messages in all from 11.26 pm onwards on May 19. He asked me to pay Rs 10 lakh within three days. He has written that I won’t begin arranging the money unless I see any one of my family members dead. He has further threatened that after expiry of the three day deadline he will begin eliminating my family members one by one in order to convince me that the threat is real. He has said that his man is in close proximity with me,” Dr Rajput told TOI.
 
 The sender also uploaded a voice message through his WhatsApp account on Dr Rajput’s number late on Sunday night. But the language could not be understood by any of her family members or aides.
 
 “While I was waiting at the SSP office on Monday, the sender made a video call again. My aide took the call but there was complete darkness at the other end. The caller sent across a message thereafter that the crime branch won’t be able to help me as it is afraid of him,” said Dr Rajput.
 
 All video calls, voice calls and messages have been made from a single WhatsApp number. 
 
 “I have ordered the SHO of Indirapuram police station to register an FIR in the matter. The crime branch of district police will investigate the case,” SSP Vaibhav Krishna said.
