AHMEDABAD:   has decided to allow undergraduate students to try improve their final year results, provided they surrender the marksheets from their earlier attempts along with the degree certificate in question.

 The varsityâ€™s examination reforms committee has decided that GU will provide only printed question papers, irrespective of the number of exam candidates. It also decided to fix liability for paper setters. 
 
 The committee also decided that those pursuing a second graduate degree at the varsity will be exempt from taking the English examination.
 
 Digvijyasinh Gohil, a member of the examination reforms committee, said the committee met on Tuesday and these four decisions were cleared unanimously and forwarded to the academic council. Once the council approves them, these decisions will need final clearance from the syndicate, before they can be implemented.
 
 Gujarat University officials said that earlier this year, the varsity had decided that students looking to improve their postgraduate results could retake examinations, provided they gave an undertaking that the latest result would be accepted. Officials said the move was then extended to undergraduate students. The results of the retaken exam will be binding on students.
 
 The committee decided that students pursuing a second graduation from the varsity would be exempt from taking the English exam as they had already taken it for their first degree.
 
 A GU official said that the university would earlier photocopy a handwritten question paper if less than 100 candidates were taking the exam in question. This had led to instances of major errors and had increased chances of a leak.
 
 The committee also resolved to summon professors involved in question-paper errors or leaks. So far, only the students involved were called for questioning.
