BANKURA: A   in   was fined for riding a two-wheeler without helmet on Sunday morning. The MP   (37) was slapped with a fine of Rs 100, which he accepted to pay. He even apologised and promised to comply with the traffic rules in future. 

 A resident of Bankura's Bhairabsthan, the first-time MP was headed to the market on his friend's scooter. His friend was riding pillion and none of them wore helmets. 
 
 They crossed a huge police team led by inspector, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who had stopped around 100 two-wheelers to check their vehicle documents. Before the team stopped Khan, the other traffic offenders who were waiting, grew restive and pointed why was the helmetless MP being let-off. The cops then stopped Khan and made him pay the violation fine under section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act and slapped with section 129 under the same act.
 
 The MP then shouted out, "I made a mistake and paid for it, you should follow me." The other violators also paid fines and received traffic violation cases.
