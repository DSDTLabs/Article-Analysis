LUCKNOW: From next week, one would be able to pay   and mutation fee online and also get an e-receipt instantly. With   (NIC) ready to hand over the software to   on Friday, the system would be up and running from next week. 

 Though LMC had initiated the digital mode of payment a few years ago, it was not completely online. People could deposit tax online but it took months for the corporation to update the amount in the owner’s account. An LMC official said, “Earlier, once tax was collected online, the bank collected data from LMC and then updated it manually. The very purpose of online tax payment was defeated in that the tax dues showed pending against a payee’s name despite him having deposited it.” 
 
  Because of system loopholes and lack of awareness among residents about online tax collection, only a minuscule percentage of home owners deposited tax online. Last year, only Rs 94 lakh was collected online against the total collection of about Rs 100 crore. LMC’s zonal officer Ashok Singh said, “Once we have promoted this system enough, we hope to increase tax collected through digital mode by 20-25% from next financial year.”
