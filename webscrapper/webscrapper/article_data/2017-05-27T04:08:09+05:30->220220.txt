MUMBAI:   in Dahisar has sent out notices to 28 students and is expected to send them out to 60 more due to a fee hike dispute with the management. Parents have been told to collect the child’s leaving certificate on May 29.

 Parents said the school had sent out the notices as they had refused to pay the hiked fees. “The school has gone against the Maharashtra Fee Regulation Act and has been increasing fees by 12-24% every year,” said the parent of an expelled student. “The school has been exerting pressure on parents to pay the exorbitant fees by threatening us that our students won’t get admission in other schools. Initially, around 600 parents were fighting against hike, now reduced to 70,” he added. The notice states that the school would fill up the seats with new applicants.
 
 Another parent said the school did not keep its promises. “It has been hiking fees on a yearly basis and has not followed through with promises of infrastructural and facility improvements. They show us a very different picture during admissions, which is not reality,” she said.
 
 School chairman Jesus Lall claimed 95% parents have agreed to the hiked fees and paid up. He said, “Often, the school is branded as an offender and parents cry foul.” He denied unlawful hiking and clarified, “As a linguistic minority school, we are exempted from the Right To Education Act, 2009. The 11-12% hike was in keeping with approval of the   (PTA).”
 
 But a parent said approval was taken from the previous year’s committee. The parents said they will soon discuss their issue.
 
 Last week, Lall represented school managements at the meeting of he committee, set up to propose amendments in the Act. School education minister   assured parents a hearing in the coming week and told the school not force parents to pay up till the issue is resolved.
