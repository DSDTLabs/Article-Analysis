Panaji: The forum for rights of children's education ( ) on Tuesday submitted over two lakh signatures in support of continuing grants to English-medium schools and against the committee constituted by the government to decide on the medium-of-instruction policy for the state.

 FORCE stated it objects to the government's delay in granting legislative sanctity to the cabinet approval of July 1, 2014, and has requested the government and the director of education to legislate and give legal sanction to the 2014 cabinet decision.
 
 “We do not demand that English-medium be made compulsory in all the schools, but rather the government should let the parents choose the medium for their children with equal grants and support to English-medium schools so that the rich as well as the poor have equal opportunities,” president Premanand Naik states in the forum's letter to the director of education and the chairman of the advisory committee to decide on the MoI.
 
 The forum has pointed out that majority of students enrolled in primary schools have opted for English as a medium-of-instruction and that there are only three Urdu and two Kannada schools from classes V to X with the rest all in the English medium, where all government high schools are in the English medium.
 
 The letter also states the schools that have had to shut down in the last few years have been Marathi and Konkani medium schools, where not a single English medium school has shut according to information provided by the department. Government schools are mostly on the verge of closing down mainly due to MoI and abysmal quality of education and the 296-plus trained English teachers hired by the government to help students migrating to English-medium also proves the government has endorsed its stand, the forum has stated.
