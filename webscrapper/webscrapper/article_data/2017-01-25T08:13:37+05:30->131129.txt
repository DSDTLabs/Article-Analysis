SURAT: Suspended millionaire police officer   was declared an absconder by a local court on Tuesday after police approached the court saying he was not cooperating in the investigation against him and was untraceable. Known for his detection abilities, the man who was once in-charge of a squad that   is now himself absconding. Patil, assistant sub inspector, was booked on corruption charges in October 2016 soon after 23 people lost their lives in Surat district and the city in hooch tragedy. 

 Before he was booked on corruption charges at Kadodara police station, Patil was suspended and transferred to Dang by Shamsher Singh, IGP, Surat range, for his alleged links with bootleggers. Later an inquiry was ordered by the IGP in which it was found that Patil had amassed over 900 per cent more wealth than his known source of income. Patil's legally declared income was around Rs40 lakh but had accumulated wealth of over Rs 3.40 crore. Initial inquiry found a total of 12 plots, three bungalows, one shop and two other constructed properties registered in the name of Patil and his family members during the period from January 2008 to March 2016. His properties include factories, a hotel and a restaurant on National Highway-8. The government records put the value of the properties at Rs 3 crore, but they are worth much more, sources said. Patil's 27-year-old unmarried son Pankaj led a lavish lifestyle and had spent nearly Rs81 lakh in the last four years on him.
