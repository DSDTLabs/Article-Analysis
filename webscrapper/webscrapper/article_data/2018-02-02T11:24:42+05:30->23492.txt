The biographical play Drama Queen, directed by  , takes the audience through a hormone driven period in the life of actor  . The play will be Suchitra’s first performance on stage after her role as Anna in the film  . It gives the audience insights into her life five years post marriage and divorce, fame, with a pinch of fiction. “Drama   is an irresistibly honest biographical play that will make you laugh, cry and look at the modern Indian woman in a whole new light,” says Suchitra.

 The play touches upon her   fame, emotional ups and downs, all in a highly dramatised manner. “The book and the play are exactly what was on my mind, but highly dramatised versions of it - like an exaggerated reality. And they do play out very well on stage. Most of it is indeed a part of my life and even many of the characters are real. Some of them were gracious enough to let me use their real names too,” she adds.
 
  
  
 
 The actor tells us that her initial fear of being under the spotlight after many years disappeared when the show - that premiered in Mumbai last year - was received warmly. “The audience sees the humour and finds it relatable. Many women have told me that they identify with the story or that they can imagine their mother reacting similarly. My friends, parents and daughter have all liked it. In fact, my mother is a central character in the play and was laughing out loud.”
