NAGPUR: The government is working to bring out a policy linking interest rates offered to a borrower with use of   in his transactions. This means more the use of cashless modes of payments less can be the rates of interest to be charged on loans.

 The policy is expected to be released in due course, said Union information technology secretary Aruna Sundarajan, who is in the city to attend Prime Minster Narendra Modi’s programme on Friday.
 
 A track record of the person’s usage of cashless modes will be checked on the basis of which the cost of borrowing can be fixed, she said.
 
 In a bid to boost the Bhim App, Modi, who will be launching a merchant payment system through it, will also announce an incentive scheme with a Rs500 crore corpus for it.
 
 “The scheme will incentivize use of mode of payment as well as its spread. A merchant using the Bhim app will be getting a cash back. Similarly, there is an incentive for referring the use to others too. The incentive is pegged to the number of referrals made,” she said.
 
 “The government will be launching the Digi Shiksha scheme to educate people on the use of cashless mode. There is a plan to cover 6 crore people under the initiative,” Sundarajan said.
 
 The Bhim app, which will be launched during the function, will enable cardless payment at outlets. The IT department is also working with the tax authorities, especially on the implementation of the Goods and   (GST) regime.
 
 She said the number of point of sale machines (POS) too have doubled in the country. “As against 1.5 million card swiping machines all over the country, the number has been taken to three million in a span of three months. This is expected to reduce the shortfall of machines,” she added.
