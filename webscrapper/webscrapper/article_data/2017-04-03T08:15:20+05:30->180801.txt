MUMBAI: The eight-year-old girl who is battling serious head injuries after a 2 kg tava fell on her head in   was shifted to the Bombay Hospital, Marine Lines from BYL Nair Hospital on Sunday. Doctors said  's condition continues to be critical but stable.

 A CT scan that was carried out on Sunday evening revealed that the parts of her skull bone broke and fell inside the brain. Neurosurgeon Dr   said that although the girl’s injury was serious, there is no imminent danger to her life. 
 
 “She is unconscious and intermittently opening her eyes. She is also moving her legs in pain. It's a good sign in such cases where some reaction is better than no reaction. It shows that even though the skull fracture is in the motor area, she has probably escaped any serious damage,” he said. The child has been put on ventilator and is being treated in the neurology ICU of the south Mumbai hospital. The doctor said her external wounds were sutured immediately and that itself reduced her chances of suffering an infection. “The good thing is that children do better than adults,” he said. The doctors may be planning a surgery once her condition improves. He however said her recovery may take a while. 
 
 On Friday morning, when the class III student of St Joseph's school in   was returning home from tuition, a griddle fell on her from the 20 storey Danish Villa in Madanpura. The Nagpada police is investigating about how and from which floor the griddle fell. At least a dozen families have come under scrutiny.
