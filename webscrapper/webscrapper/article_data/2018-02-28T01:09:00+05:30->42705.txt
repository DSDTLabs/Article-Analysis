Madurai: Soon, devotees coming to the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple will not be able to carry their mobile phones inside the temple as the Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department has decided to setup cellphone wallets and storeroom on the premises. 

 The HR&CE department told this to the Madurai bench of the Madras high court which was hearing a batch of cases relating to measures to be taken for the safety of the temple on Tuesday. 
 
 The court also suo moto impleaded the Madurai Corporation and local planning authority and directed them to identify structures that have been raised against the government norms near the temple and file a report before it on March 6. It further directed the HR&CE department to consider purchasing an advanced firefighting equipment for the temple. 
 
 A division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and R Tharani heard the cases. When it asked about the steps taken, petitioner’s counsel K Neelamegam said that despite the court passing an order on February 9 banning cell phones inside the temple, the HR&CE did not follow it. Besides, the HR&CE needed to focus on fire safety measures. Even in cinema theatres, advance fire fighting equipment exist. But such equipment is not available in Meenakshi temple, the counsel said.
 
 Replying to it, HR&CE counsel V R Shanmuganathan said, “More than 15,000 people come to the temple. Before banning cell phones, there is a need for cell phone wallets and storeroom, for which work is going on. It will take two weeks for work to get completed.” 
 
 As far as CCTVs are concerned, there are 67 cameras in the temple, of which 60 can store data for one month.
