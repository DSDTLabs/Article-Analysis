THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   on Monday called for change in Kerala society’s mindset, an attitudinal change that sees development and progress positively, a statement made in the best tradition of Deng Xiaoping’s revisionism by a man generally perceived to be a doctrinaire  .

  “The government gets substantial support and cooperation from government officials. But a section of them has some attitudinal problem towards development projects. I don’t consider this their fault. Rather, they only reflect the general mindset of Kerala”, the chief minister said, while interacting with the TOI editorial team here on Monday. He was the guest editor for the May 1 edition of TOI.
 
 Vijayan said Kerala should try to emulate other states where people, cutting across differences, come together for the common development of their state. “A culture of togetherness for the development cause should trickle in'', he said.
