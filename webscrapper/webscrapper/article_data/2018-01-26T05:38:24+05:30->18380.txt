CHENNAI: A four-year-old boy was left with severe injuries after he fell into a gap between an escalator and staircase at a newly built textile showroom in   on Wednesday night. 

 Police said the boy was identified as  , son of  , a lathe employee, and   of Thelliyar Agaram near Porur. 
 
 On Wednesday evening, Kavitha along with her son had gone shopping to buy toys and dresses. She took the escalator with Yuvan and reached the sixth floor. While she was looking at the clothes on display, her son ran away to play near the escalator.
 
 Yuvan stepped on the escalator and leaned on a piece of plywood which was temporarily installed to plug the gap between the escalator and stairs, said a police official. 
 
 The plywood gave way and he plunged through the gap and landed on the third floor. His mother and showroom staff ran to the spot and found him bleeding severely with injuries on his head and legs. The boy was rushed to a private hospital in Manapakkam where his condition is said to be serious.
 
 “The gap should have been properly closed using concrete. They had just kept a piece of plywood. The textile shop was opened recently and some of the work is yet to be completed,” said another police officer.
 
 Customers at the showroom blamed the textile shop management for not adhering to basic safety standards. The management subsequently filled in the gap permanently to prevent another incident like this.
 
 The family did not lodge a police complaint after the showroom officials promised to pay the hospital expenses.
 
 Doctors said the boy, a student at a private school in  , received sutures to the scalp and will be moved to the ward on Friday.
