AHMEDABAD: The independent MLA from   in   district, Bhupendrsinh Khant, approached the   high court against the tribal development commission’s scrutiny committee concluding that his caste certificate as a member of a Scheduled Tribe (ST) was invalid.

 With the opinion to invalidate his caste certificate, Khant’s status as a legislator would be in jeopardy because he has been elected from a constituency reserved for an ST candidate.
 
 Sources said that in his petition, Khant alleged that the tribal development commission’s decision to invalidate his caste certificate was politically motivated. This happened after he extended support to the   party after being elected as an independent candidate.
 
 Khant contended in his petition that at the time of filing nominations, objections raised by rival candidates were addressed by the election officials and his caste certificate was held valid. The rival candidates could have objected to his candidature and election by filing an election petition before the high court. But getting the caste certificate cancelled by a government body, which is under heavy influence of the ruling party, is nothing but a politically motivated move.
 
 Khant was elected as an independent candidate from Morva Hadaf after the Congress party did not field a candidate, allowing its ally the   (BTP) to field a candidate, following their pre-poll alliance.
 
 On Friday, tribal development commissioner   said that a vigilance committee was appointed to verify Khant’s ST certificate. “After detailed record verification and a first hand report, the committee recommended that the certificate is invalid. We have submitted the report. Now the concerned authorities will take a decision.”
 
 Khant’s petition is likely to be heard on Monday by Justice Bela Trivedi.
