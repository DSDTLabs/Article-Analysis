KOCHI: Actress   has opted out of the lead role in the upcoming biopic of Malayalm poet Kamala Surayya. The much awaited film, to be released this year, was to be directed by Kamal, who has been targeted by state BJP leaders. 

 The director had come under the attack from the state BJP general secretary A N Radhakrishnan who said that Kamal should leave the country as he had spoken against the cops for arresting people who did not stand up when the national anthem was played before the screening of a movie at the IFFK, Thiruvananthapuram. 
 
 Kamal was also singled out for coming out in support of writer and Jnanpith award winner M T  , who spoke about the woes of common man due to the demonetisation drive.
 
 A source close to the actress denied that veiled threats from the BJP did not have any connection for Vidya dropping out of the role. “Vidya has very different approaches to the film and therefore opted out of the film in the most amicable and professional manner and any other reason being cited is untrue.’’ The latest about turn by the actress is seen as a let down by industry watchers who feel that the actress may not want to take too many chances, that too about one of the best known poets in the country whose life story is riddled with an eventful narrative of unrequited love and deep-rooted sensual obsessions, breaking all religious barriers.
 
  aka Kamala Das, also known to Malayali readers as their own  , lived life in her own terms, an iconoclast who even converted to Islam after allegedly falling in love with a Muslim following her husband’ s death.
 
 The poet never went public about her love and she died as a Muslim and was buried at   in Thiruvananthapuram seven years ago.
