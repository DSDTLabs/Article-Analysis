NAGAPATTINAM: In December 2004, the   middle school in  , a   in  , was ravaged by the tsunami. Thirteen years later, from the verge of being shut down, the school has now received an   certification, which, even private schools in the vicinity cannot boast about. 

 Situated close to the sea, the 2004 tsunami claimed 80 lives from this school alone. Post-tsunami, the number of students came down to just 92 from 192 as parents feared sending their children to this school. A decade later, the school now has 390 children and the numbers are expected to cross 450 in the next academic year. 
 
 The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms Wi-Fi enabled and the school has science and computer labs. Apart from safe drinking water and toilet facilities, it also has a rooftop garden to teach gardening to the children. "It was necessary to give a facelift to the school and regain the confidence of the people who were attracted to private schools," said R Balu, who joined as headmaster of the school in 2013. 
 
 "Since government schools can only enrol for Class I, I started taking kindergarten classes for children by appointing special teachers in the school with the help of villagers," he said. And there was no looking back. The village and various NGOs support the school financially, apart from former students. 
 
 "We were under the assumption that the school which lost 80 of its students would be in ruins. We were taken aback when we visited it recently," said D Karthikeyan, director of Quest Certification Private Limited, an India-based certification body which recommended the school for ISO certification.
