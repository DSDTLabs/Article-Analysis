LUCKNOW: Chief minister   is upset with the PWD department over the slow progress in construction of five new medical colleges by   ( ) headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. 

 Three days ago, CM held a review meet on progress in construction of medical colleges and expressed displeasure at the pace, particularly when majority funding is by the Centre and only 25% by the state. Yogi warned UPRNN officials to complete construction or face action.
 
 Now, the medical education department is actively considering lodging an FIR against some contractors and UPRNN officials.
 
 UPRNN managing director is Rajan Mittal, who was sacked as MD, Bridge Corporation after the Varanasi flyover crashed. Despite   failing to meet the deadline as UPRNN head, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya does not want to leave him, though the state is drawing flak from the Centre for poor progress in construction of colleges.
 
 Director-general of medical education   said only 25-30% work is complete despite release of funds. In view of acute shortage of medical manpower, the Central government released funds to the UP government in the   regime for construction of five medical colleges. The medical colleges were to be developed in Basti, Bahraich, Shahjehanpur, Ferozabad and Faizabad.
