SAHARASA: Supply of liquor, though strictly banned in the state, has suddenly increased in Kosi division this Durga Puja. Sources said police and the excise department are facing an uphill task to curb   in Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura districts.

 “It will indeed be a hide and seek game between the police and the devotees who consider liquor to be an essential component of their tantrik cult of worship,” said a source.
 
 A large number of devotees and ascetic gurus throng   at Mahishi, Chandi temple at Viratpur and Katyayini temple at Dhamhara which are widely acclaimed as ancient Shakti Peeth. “It has been usually witnessed every year that locals and those from distant places gather on the temple premises since evening on Mahaashtami and at exactly the mid-night, they offer a little quantity of liquor in the divine feet of the goddess and consume the rest in the company of their friends,” said a source, adding in the past it had also been observed that youths nuisance in a drunken state create and disturb law and order. 
 
 Police, however, said they will not allow any violation of prohibition. “From a child worshipper to the temple priests and all other devotees are aware of the fact that there is complete ban on liquor in the state. Use of liquor in the temple or anywhere else will be a violation of the state law and this will not be tolerated,” Saharsa SDPO Saharsa Ganpati said.
 
 DSP (headquarters) Arvind Kumar said police have recovered a huge quantity of India-made   in the last three days from different places, including Kahra Kuti, Baijanpatti and Dhakjari villages. “We have intensified raids against bootleggers. The administration will keep a strict vigil and deal firmly with the troublemakers,” the DSP added.
