Her Tamil movie   has been winning rave reviews ever since its release and after portraying a role as unique as that of a pregnant, hearing impaired woman,   has taken up a character that is its polar opposite! In director Sethu’s debut film  , Shamna will play a police officer named Neena.

 “There is a tinge of humour to the character,” says Sethu, adding, “Krishnapuram police station has only seen policemen till then. When a pretty woman takes charge as an officer there, it surprises the villagers as it’s something they have never witnessed. It becomes an episode on the blog, through which the film’s story is narrated.”
 
 Mammootty plays the blogwriter Hari, who is quite an influential character of the area. The film’s shoot will start in the first week of March and the movie also has Anu Sithara and Raai Laxmi as the female leads.
 
 Meanwhile, Shamna is quite excited to play her first cop role. “I was offered roles as police officers even in the past, but I didn’t take them as I didn’t think it would suit me. I am happy that finally, I am doing it in a project with a good crew and a great character.” When asked about how she would style herself, Shamna says, “I am not sure yet. But, I quite like my cropped hair look and I have not been letting it grow much.”
 
 The actress has been in the film industry for 10 years now and says that going forward, she wishes to take up more challenging roles. “I am still quite overwhelmed by the responses I got for Savarakathi from everyone in the industry. For instance, Remya Krishnan, who sat next to me for the premiere, showered me with hugs and kisses watching me on screen. Alongside doing lovable girl-next-door characters, I also want to attempt such roles from now on.”
