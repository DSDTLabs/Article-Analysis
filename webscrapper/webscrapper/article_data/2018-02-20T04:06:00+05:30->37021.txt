Vadodara: A woman and her paramour were arrested on Monday for allegedly killing the former’s husband on Sunday midnight at his house in Vadu village of Padra taluka.

 Police said that the deceased Dharmesh Barot (32) had moved into the accused Prashant Barot’s house as tenant with his wife Puja after which his wife had an extra-marital affair with Prashant. When Dharmesh, who works as a cable operator, learnt about their affair, he moved to another house near his parents’ house. However, even then Puja and Prashant continued with their affair, police said.
 
 After she was arrested, Puja told the police that Dharmesh was a hurdle in her affair with Prashant, so they decided to eliminate him. On Sunday evening, the Prashant told Puja that he will come to her house around midnight to kill Dharmesh. As per the plan, Prashant entered from the backdoor and slit Dharmesh’s throat with a blade while he was asleep.
 
 Dharmesh tried to retaliate, but the accused made multiple cuts on his throat killing him instantly. While Prashant escaped from there, Puja woke up her mother-in-law and Dharmesh’s employer to inform about her husband’s death. “She initially told everyone that Dharmesh had committed suicide and she realized it only when their two-year-old son started to cry,” said Vadu police inspector Manoj Swami. “But as we interrogated her further, she eventually confessed to the crime,” he added.
 
 The police arrested Puja immediately, while Prashant was arrested later from his home.
