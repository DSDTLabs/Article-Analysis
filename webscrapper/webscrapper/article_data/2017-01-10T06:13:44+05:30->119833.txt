PUNE: Regular   commuters in the city will no longer have to worry about carrying exact change while travelling in PMPML buses as the   is all set to introduce pre-paid ‘MI cards’ which can be used to pay the fare. 

 The card can also be used as e-purse to make payments towards property tax, water tax, parking fees, etc.
 
 Four such cards were issued last week to PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd) officials on a pilot basis. The officials are expected to check feasibility of the cards. Nearly three lakh commuters, including students, use PMPML bus passes. Officials plan to convert all bus passes into MI cards in the next four to six months. A passenger will have to pay Rs 80 initially for a personalized card and submit all the required documents, including a photocopy of Aadhaar card. 
 
 Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar said, “The aim is to promote more usage of the public transport. Commuters who make multiple journeys will benefit from the card as they will not have to buy several tickets. It will make commuting easy.” PMPML operates nearly 1,200 buses. More than 10 lakh people take these buses every day.
 
 Kumar said, “Nearly 350 buses were being scrapped and 1,550 new buses will be added to the fleet in the coming days. All the new buses will be equipped with swipe machines. Commuters have to just swipe the card while boarding and getting off the buses. The fare will be calculated automatically and the sum deducted from the card.” Officials of the property tax department said the card will benefit over eight lakh property tax payers. 
 
 Suhas Mapari, head of PMC’s property tax department, said, “We are giving various options to property tax payers to make payments. The card being launched for public transport buses will have multiple usages and one of it will be to pay property tax. Swipe machines will be installed at property tax collection centres where owners can make the payments.”
