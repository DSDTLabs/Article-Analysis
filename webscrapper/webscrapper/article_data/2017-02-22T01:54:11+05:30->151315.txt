NEW DELHI: A group of   held a candlelight   in Hauz Khas Village on Tuesday evening to protest against the sexual assault on a 26-year-old woman at  .

 The protest was organised by Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network (MWGS) and was joined in by activists of all hues. They all demanded a proper investigation of the case. 
 
 “The incident was unfortunate, hence we are raising our voice. A proper investigation must be done by the police. This isn’t the first such case in the city. The woman was targeted because she was from the Northeast. As an activist, I fear to go out after 9pm,” said Binalakshmi Nepram of MWGS. 
 
 The protesters, among them women and senior citizens, said Hauz Khas was a place where anyone could come freely to enjoy. “This protest is to change the mentality of the society. Women are not safe and nobody is talking about it,” said Nilanjana Sengupta of Azad Foundation. 
 
 Nepram demanded a national diversity policy. “There are about five to seven lakh people from the Northeast in Delhi who come for better employment and educational opportunities. But they always face discrimination and harassment,” she said. 
 
 Many passersby joined the protest too. Nahida Parveen and Malvika Kaushik, regular visitors to Hauz Khas, said things have gone downhill in the last two years.
