Jabalpur/Bhopal: A division bench of Madhya Pradesh high court (MPHC) on Friday dismissed anticipatory bail application of People’s Group chairman Dr S N Vijayvargiya. However, the court allowed the regular bail application of L N Group’s Jai Narayan Chaukse, who was arrested by the CBI from his home.

 The bench comprising Hemant Gupta and Justice V K Shukla refused to grant bail to Vijayvargiya on the grounds of illness and said a medical examination should be conducted on him at the time of arrest and proper treatment be provided to him. Stating that illness was not a convincing ground for bail, the judges observed that the accused has been evading arrest since November while many of his co-accused surrendered after their bail application was rejected. 
 
 However, the court granted regular bail to J N Chaukse, who was arrested on March 21. He was asked to provide surety of Rs 1 lakh for bail. Chaukse was asked to surrender his passport with the CBI and not do anything, which influences evidence in the case.
 
 Both Vijayvargiya and Chaukse are accused in PMT-2012 scam. They have been charged with providing wrong information about vacancies in their medical colleges to the department of medical education (DME) and giving admission to ineligible persons on the vacant seats in state quota.
