 Defence minister Nirmala   is likely to make her maiden visit to China next month, amid heightened tensions along the Line of Actual Control after last year’s Doklam stand-off near the   junction, in the run-up to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in June.

 “Yes, (the visit is) probably sometime in late April,” said Sitharaman on Monday. But defence ministry officials said the “date, venue and agenda” for the visit are yet to be finalized.
 
 Sitharaman’s visit assumes significance in the backdrop of the chill in relations after the 73-day stand-off at Doklam, a disputed territory between China and Bhutan, as well as the huge shift in China’s polity following the abolition of the two-term limit on Xi Jinping’s presidency on Sunday. India remains wary of China’s assertiveness all along the LAC, stretching from Ladakh to  . Though Indian troops last June had blocked China’s attempt to extend a road into south Doklam, leading to the troop face-off, its fallout has seen the People’s Liberation Army ramp up its presence in north Doklam .
