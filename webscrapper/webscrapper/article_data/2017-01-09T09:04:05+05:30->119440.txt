HYDERABAD: Dozens of   (OU) students burnt effigies of chief minister   on Sunday blaming the government for not fulfilling its promise of providing jobs.
Multiple rallies were held at the sprawling campus by members of the   which announced plans to gherao the chief minister's camp office on Monday. The JAC also planned to hold pada yatras across the state .
 
 Inside campus, protesters shouted slogans against the government and said it has failed to fulfil its election promise of creating 1.5 lakh jobs for unemployed youth and hundreds of students who participated in the statehood movement. Before storming to power, the TRS had promised a slew of measures for students and claimed it would give them jobs in the government sector, but lakhs of its foot soldiers have been left in the lurch .
 
 “The TRS government used us during the separation movement and has now cast a blind eye to our pleas and suffering,“ said Ramesh Ninjanna, a stu dent leader who was active during the Telangana movement.
 
 Students also protested the state government's move to regularise contract employees.“There are over 1.5 lakh posts vacant in government departments. It is unfair to regularise the contract lecturers who didn't play a major role in the Telangana movement,“ said   , president of OU JAC. As per data, there are nearly 4,000 junior lecturers working on contract basis in the university. Students of OU have been demanding the government release   notification for posts, including junior lecturers and degree lectures at college level for three years now. While the TRS government has not released the notification, students said the AP government had done so. “The KCR government has cheated the students' community. The government issued notifications for posts which were not relevant for students,“ said E Vinod, a student activist.
