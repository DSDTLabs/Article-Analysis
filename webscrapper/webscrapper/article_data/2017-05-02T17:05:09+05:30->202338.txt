AHMEDABAD: The Forest officials of the   in Amreli were emotional when they had to shift two four-month-old cubs to the rescue centre in  . The two cubs were being taken care for the last 12 days by the forest officials after their mother died of septicemia.

 The lioness had a wound and during the treatment, on April 18, it died of septicemia. The forest department officials aware of the fact that the lioness had mothered two cubs and both were too young to mend their own ways, decided to take care of the two cubs. 
 
 The forest department wanted to bring up the cubs in the wild and ensure that they were not sent to the rescue centre. The officials said, “If the cubs are sent to the rescue centre, later they are sent to the zoo as they cannot develop hunting skills, but in this case, we wanted to bring them up in the forest only. However, we began giving them liquid meat which they could digest,” said a senior officer.
 
 Chief Conservator of forest AP Singh said, “The mother died and the department wanted to bring up the cubs in the wild, we fed them for the last 10 days with the hope that some other lioness probably her aunt would take care of the cubs and would accept them in the group, but there was no acceptance or any movement of any lioness in the area and hence the department decided to rescue the two cubs and sent them to rescue centre.”
