CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K   on Thursday ordered the   to reinstall the statue of Daily Thanthi group founder S B Adithanar at the   junction by September 20, following a request from the daily's promoters.
 
 The state government's decision arrives in the wake of opposition leaders expressing disapproval of the civic body's slow pace of execution of the traffic island redesign work at that Pantheon Road junction.
  
 Last week, TOI reported that the corporation and city traffic police had dropped plans for a peanut-shaped traffic island.
 
 In a statement, Palaniswami, while extolling Adithanar's role in making newspapers affordable to the working class in the state, pointed out that Daily Thanthi promoters had requested him to expedite work on constructing a pedestal to reinstall the statue. "Accordingly, I have ordered the city corporation to finish construction of a concrete pedestal at the spot by September 20, as celebrations have been planned for Adithanar's birthday on September 27," Palaniswami said.
  
 The chief minister added that the corporation would finish design and traffic island improvement work around the statue by the end of December.
