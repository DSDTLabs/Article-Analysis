Model   plans to embrace her grey hair when the time comes.

 During an interview for the   newspaper, she was asked if she can see a day when she will embrace the grey, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
 
 She said: "Oh definitely. Every two weeks, when I pull out that box of black dye, I'm like, 'God, wouldn't it be great to not be doing this?' But be careful what you wish for, right?"
 
 Her burlesque shows are still hugely popular. But Von Teese said she considered retiring two years ago before realising she wants to be an "example" for older women.
 
 "I had a lot of pressure from my former producing partner. Every night I'd come offstage and she'd be like, 'Oh, you didn't look so good right there... Can we cover up this? You need to really suck it in.
 
 I was thinking, 'Oh God, maybe I should quit before people start seeing all the flaws that could arise from the ageing process. It was starting to get to me.
 
 "(But) it occurred to me that there are all these women who are older that I admire,  ,  ,  , and they are all out there still. It has meaning for me to watch them go through different phases of life and still embrace their sexuality and sensuality. I need to be an example as well. I love performing burlesque, people still want to see me do it."
