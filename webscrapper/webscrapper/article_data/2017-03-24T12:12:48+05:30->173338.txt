VADODARA: The sessions court rejected   of  , an aide of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth’s founder  , in cash-for-marks scam on Thursday.

 Tailor had filed for bail on March 10 for his non-involvement in the alleged offence and on grounds of ill health. During the hearing, Tailor’s lawyer Shailesh Patel argued that Tailor’s name in the complaint is not disclosed as the complainant has not mentioned anything about Tailor. It was also argued that Tailor had only counted the cash in question, therefore his role in the offence is limited. His old age and his diabetes was also put up as argument for bail.
 
 On the other hand public prosecutor K P Chauhan opposed his bail on several grounds. Chauhan told the court that Tailor is a retired   thus he must be aware that no cash can be accepted without giving a receipt which was not done so in this case. 
 
 Tailor draws a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 from Shah thus he committed the offence for him, Chauhan argued. Meanwhile, Shah’s bail plea will be heard on March 27.
