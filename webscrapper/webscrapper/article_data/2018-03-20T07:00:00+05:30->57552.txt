GURUGRAM: MCG on Monday demolished 11 properties which were being built within 900 metres of the   and sealed 25 properties, including 16 flats and nine shops.

 A team of officials from the enforcement department, along with 100 cops, carried out the demolition   under duty magistrate Anu Sheokhand who is MCG joint commissioner. Officials said that there was some resistance from people in the Ashok Vihar area but the rest of the drive was peaceful.
 
 “As per orders from the Punjab and Haryana high court, we have drawn up a schedule for   of all illegal   within the restricted zone around the ammunition depot. In phase one, we will only seal or demolish under-construction properties or new constructions,” said Mohan Singh, district town planner, MCG. He added that a two-and-a-half-month drive has been planned and demolition would be carried out every third day. MCG will not demolish or seal older constructions yet because in their case, compensation amounts have to be decided first.
 
 MCG officials also appealed to people living within 900 metres of the ammunition depot to not start new constructions in the area as they would be razed down. “Going forward, if more cases of new constructions are found in the restricted zone, not only will the buildings be razed but an FIR will also be filed against those responsible,” said Singh. In the past one and a half year, MCG has submitted applications, seeking more than 160 FIRs against   constructions within 900 metres of the ammunition depot. 
 
 TOI had earlier reported that MCG was planning a demolition schedule. Officials are also drawing up a list of property owners and their details which has been sought by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh to decide compensation for those affected by the drive.
