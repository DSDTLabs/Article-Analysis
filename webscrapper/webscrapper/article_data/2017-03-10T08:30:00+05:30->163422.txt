BENGALURU: Manoj P, a resident of BTM Layout in south Bengaluru, cannot sleep without his earplugs on these days, thanks to the blaring horns of vehicles criss-crossing his neighbourhood through the night.

 More pubs and eateries opening in the once-quiet BTM Layout has become a nightmare for its residents. The layout was exclusively developed as a residential locality by the   in the late 1980s. Carved out of Byrasandra, Tavarekere and Madiwala villages, it was named BTM.
 
 As southeast Bengaluru turned into an IT hub, the adjoining BTM Layout was among the earliest casualties. Straddling   and  , among the city’s busiest stretches, the locality witnessed a surge in vehicular traffic to and from the IT hub.
 
 BTM Layout now tops the list of areas most affected by noise pollution in the city, according to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board ( ).
 
 A senior KSPCB official told TOI that rising noise levels at night, particularly in residential localities, is a cause for concern. “While the permissible noise level for residential areas at night is 45 dBA, it’s 63.6 dBA in BTM Layout. Similarly, in Domlur, a residential area in east Bengaluru, it’s 58.9 dBA and in west Bengaluru’s S G Halli it’s 55.4 dBA,” he said.
 
 The officer said while they do warn and issue notices to pubs for playing loud music, keeping a check on noise pollution by vehicles was difficult.
 
 More construction and renovation of buildings is only adding to the noise pollution in the area, said environmentalist Pranav V. “Constant noise of marble polishing and drilling work disturbs the tranquility of the locality, and can affect residents’ health in the long run. The pollution control board needs to get more teeth to punish the culprits. Their powers don’t extend beyond issuing notices at present. Police and other civic agencies should also ensure that rules regarding vehicular traffic in residential areas are followed,” he said.
