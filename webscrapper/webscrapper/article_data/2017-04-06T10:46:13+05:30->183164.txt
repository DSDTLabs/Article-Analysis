A city court issued notices to the producer and the director of a film on a late TV actress, asking as to why contempt proceedings should not be started against them for releasing the film despite a stay on it.
 
  Late actress  's boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh, who is accused of abetting her suicide, had moved the court seeking to stop the release of the shot film on her and the court had stayed the release last week.
  
  "We pointed out during the arguments today that despite the stay, the film was released," said Rahul's lawyer Shreyansh Mithare.
  
  
 
  
  The court issued a show-cause notice to the director   and the producer Neru Shah and asked them to appear on April 7, failing which a non-bailable warrant will be issued against them.
  
  Rahul claimed in his application to the court that the film was an attempt to show him in poor light and would prejudice the case against him.
  
  24-year-old Pratyusha, who had risen to fame with TV serial "Balika Vadhu," had allegedly committed suicide at her apartment in Mumbai on April 1, 2016.
