KRISHNAGIRI: Despite a case on permanent closure of the   unit is pending in the Madras high court, the state government closed the unit respecting people’s feelings, said   leader K P Munusamy.

 
 Speaking to reporters at his home in   on Tuesday, Munusamy said the government would take steps to close the unit permanently.
 
 On DMK working president M K Stalin’s demand to arrest chief minister   for killing 13 people in police firings, he questioned why no case was registered against M Karunanidhi during whose regime 13 police firings had took place across the state.
 
 On the   issue, Munusamy said the Tamil Nadu government would get state’s share of water from Karnataka through legal means at the earliest.
