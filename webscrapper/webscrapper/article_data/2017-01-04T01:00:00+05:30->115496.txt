The upcoming track of SAB’s 'Y.A.R.O.  ' will see Mr. X, a new character, terrorising the city. The entire city will be in trouble when Mr. X appoints Kamal, an evil magician, to steal a dangerous missile and kidnap Professor Agarwal, who is one of the designers of the missile. When   ( ) and Dadi (Shoma Anand) realise that the missile is missing, they look for it in order to save the public. However, Kamal traps Professor Agarwal ( ) by hypnotising him and making the police believe that he is behind the 
evil plans. Though the cops are under the impression that the professor is involved in the missile robbery, Yo Man and Dadi feel that there is something fishy. 
 Unfortunately, Mr. X decodes the missile with the hypnotised professor’s help and uses it to seek ransom from the government. Yo Man tries to stop the government from paying up, but does not succeed. Even after the demands are met, Mr. X still launches the missile to destroy the city.
 Aniruddh says, “This week’s track is going to be a thrilling adventure with a lot of action scenes. Yo Man will have to fight against a dangerous villain. He has a tough task ahead — saving the city as well as saving his father’s reputation. I hope the audience likes it!”
 'Y.A.R.O Ka Tashan' airs from Monday – Friday at 7.30 pm on Sony  .
