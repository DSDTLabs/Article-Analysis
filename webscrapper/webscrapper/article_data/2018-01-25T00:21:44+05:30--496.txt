MUMBAI: Two children died and four others suffered side-effects caused by immunization in January so far, said the civic corporation’s public health department. Between 2013 and 2018, 25 children died and 146 others suffered vaccine-related side-effects.

 BMC officials said these cases weren’t alarming. The national number, for instance, stands at 10,612 deaths in a 10-year period and   registered 187 deaths. RTI activist Chetan Kothari who compiled the 10-year figures of deaths due to vaccines said that Andhra Pradesh registered the highest number of such deaths, followed by Odisha and Bihar. “Maharashtra and Mumbai present a positive story in comparison. Maharashtra has only registered 187 deaths in the last 10 years as compared to 5,000 plus in Andhra Pradesh in the same period,” he said 
 
 An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is a well-recognized public health term. It helps the public health department track down a contaminated batch of vaccines if some children suffer side-effects; the vaccine batch can then be withdrawn from the market to prevent further harm. “The surveillance mechanism in Mumbai is extremely effective and a useful tool,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar.
 
 Another senior BMC doctor pointed out that each vaccine-related death or adverse reaction case is investigated by a committee. 
 
 Immunisation has helped improve life expectancy in India, by controlling infant and child mortality rates. Diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus claimed thousands of lives every year, but not any more. Disability-causing diseases such as polio have been eradicated due to immunization. In 2014, the Centre launched Mission Indradhanush with the aim of immunizing all children under the age of two years against seven vaccine-preventable diseases. 
 
 In cities such as Mumbai, almost 85% of the targeted children are vaccinated before their first birthday.
