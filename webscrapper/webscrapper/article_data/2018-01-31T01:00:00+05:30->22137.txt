 Kashyap’s latest single, which releases today, talks about a grave issue — social media addiction. Titled 'WannabeFree', the track’s video features actress   Chadha. Shibani says, “People are latching onto social media and so, it’s the need of the hour to be vocal about its ill-effects. Both Richa and I resonate with the concept. She has not walked into it blindly — she liked the song and we both have created the hashtag WannabeFree. It was great working with her.” 

 The singer, however, asserts that if used responsibly, social media is a great platform. “I detach myself from social media from time to time. I’m appalled by the way people are dependent on their phones and laptops. It’s high time we addressed this issue to keep humanity alive,” she adds.
 
 WannabeFree' has an EDM, clubby feel and is composed and sung by Shibani. Released by  , it has been produced by Rajiv Roda and  , and directed by Lloyd Baptisa. Shibani elaborates, “My song has been penned by award-winning lyricist, Rashmi Virag. This is our comeback song together and the lyrics are very meaningful. It goes, ‘Khud se mile hue, ek arsa hua, Pata bhi na chala, yeh kaise hua, Hum kya se kya hain ban gaye,   saans ka jism ban gaye. Iss kaid se mujhe aazad karo, Wannabefree’.”
