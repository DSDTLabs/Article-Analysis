CHENNAI: Private equity investments seem poised for the best growth in 2017 as $17.6 billion has been invested in the first nine months of the year, surpasses the previous full year high of $17.3 billion in 2015. But this year it’s high deal size, low volume game as some of the euphoria around the startup scene wears off.

 The record breaking value figures have however been accompanied by a fall in terms of deal volumes, according to data from Venture Intelligence.
 
 The number of deals in the first nine months of 2017 (at 402) are 23% lower than that in the comparable period during the previous year, and 35% lower compared to the same period in 2015. Experts say when it comes to number of deals, the third quarter of 2017 has the lowest deals.
 
 “While the value of the deals has gone up, the volumes are down. This is primarily because of a slowdown in the venture capital size, which was better known for smallticket but numerous deals. This quarter however, series-A, series-B and seed funding has been on the decline, even as growth stage funding investments are going up,” says  , founder, Venture Intelligence.
 
 Mega deals have been dominated by four sectors — internet, mobile infrastructure; IT services, BPO and  .
 
 And the year has recorded 21 investments over $200 million in size in addition to 15 deals between $100-$200 million. SoftBank’s mega bets on internet and mobile companies alone accounts for 24% of total investment value. Its investments include $250 million in budget hotels aggregator  , $1.4 billion in mobile wallet leader   and a $2.5 billion in e-commerce leader  .
 
 “Venture capitalists are now more reluctant to invest in early-stage companies. They want to focus only on startups that have achieved growth and scale. For instance look at Swiggy. Despite the bloodbath in 2016 — with Tiny Owl, others in food-tech, investors are still pumping money into  , but not into anyone else. VCs now seem to want to focus only on the winners in each sector,” says Natrajan.
 
 PE firms invested about $5.7 billion across 106 deals during the quarter ended September 2017 — the second largest quarter ever, behind January– March quarter of 2017, which recorded $6.4 billion being invested across 163 transactions.
 
 The investment amount was 73% higher than that in third quarter of 2016, which had witnessed $3.3 billion being invested across 153 transactions and 5% higher than the immediate previous quarter, which saw $5.4 billion across 133 transactions.
 
 The number of investments in July-September has been the lowest in 2017 — down 31% compared to the same period last year and down 20% compared to the previous one.
