Looks like   is making a comeback of sorts in Kollywood, what with a plethora of films in hand now — Kaala, RK Nagar and Ghajinikanth. The latest buzz is that he has been roped in to be a part of Karthik Thangavel’s Adanga Maru, which has Jayam   in the lead. “I play a cop in Ravi’s film. It is an interesting character, a pivotal one, which has multiple layers. I have already begun shooting for my portions in the film,” says Sampath. 

 The actor says that all the four films have him in different roles. “In Kaala, I play a character with negative shades. My role basically sets the tone of the film. I had a wonderful time acting alongside  . He’s all that people say — humble and easygoing. That shows he has kept his professional side away from his personal life. Having grown up in Bengaluru, he enquired about the city and asked if the trees were still intact (laughs). It was so easy to work with the Superstar,” he says, adding, “RK Nagar is a fun film. In Ghajinikanth, I play the heroine’s father. I ensure I get meaty roles, plus, I didn’t want to do similar roles in all the films.” 
 
 Quiz him about his long break from Tamil cinema and   says that it wasn’t intentional. “It wasn’t conscious. I was held up doing films in Telugu. For some interesting Tamil films offers that came my way, I didn’t have dates. For a few others, script wasn’t interesting. But I am glad to be part of interesting projects now.” Sampath also has two films in Telugu — with   and Gopichand. He also has two Kannada films and will be starting a   film with newcomer Girish in April.
