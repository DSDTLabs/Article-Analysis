NEW DELHI: The   on Monday asked for a time-bound implementation of the procedure for cleaning sewers and septic tanks so that law banning manual scavenging could be properly enforced. 

 A bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Sunil Gaur gave the direction after the Delhi government informed that the lieutenant governor had recently set up a committee to examine various measures for the implementation of “The Prohibition of Employment of Manual Scavenger and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013”.
 
 HC asked the three corporations, Delhi Jal Board, Public Works Department, Delhi Cantonment Board, New Delhi Municipal Council and the divisional railway manager of northern railway to implement the procedure and to give a time frame within which it would be accomplished. 
 
 “You need to constitute rules and methodology,” the bench said and listed the matter for September 27.
 
 Meanwhile, in a report the Delhi government said the committee would chalk out a road map to achieve 100% mechanisation along with estimated time frame. Its mandate would be to “prepare standard operating practices (SOPs) for cleaning sewer lines, septic tanks and covered drains having sewer like character. The SOPs prepared will take into account the various provisions of the Act and rules dealing with the safety, health and life insurance of the workers”.
 
 The report said that SOPs should be implemented by all the agencies and if the work was executed through contract, it should also be applicable to all the contractors. The committee, which was formed on September 5, has to submit its report to the LG within a period of two weeks, it said.
 
 HC also asked amicus curiae Sanjay Poddar and petitioner advocate Ashok Agarwal to inform about the drawbacks of the model rules framed by the Centre on the issue.
