MUMBAI: A semblance of colour is back in   with the rains having blessed the state this year. The festival will begin with   bonfire on Sunday evening. Dhuleti or the play of colour will be celebrated on Monday.

 North India is witnessing a saffron Holi in the aftermath of the BJP’s victory in UP and Uttarakhand assembly elections. In Mumbai, certain stalls in Andheri and Chinchpokli have laid out saffron gulal prominently to attract celebrants this year. However, there is no visible demand from the political segment just yet.
 
 Still, gulal dealer Sudhir Sharma of Sharma Enterprises says sales have picked up over last year. “In 2016 Holi was a muted affair because Maharashtra was facing an acute water shortage owing to the previous year’s drought,” he said.
 
 However, Ritu Rawat of Riddhi Siddhi Enterprises, Ghatkopar, which manufactures herbal colour, says the after-effects of demonetisation are visible.
 
 Shops are stocked with various sizes of pichkaris suited to little hands of children as well as adults. Simple “bamboo pichkaris” cost Rs 70-100 while those shaped like cartoon characters like Angry Birds and Doraemon come for Rs 300-350. “These come with a water tank of one litre capacity attached to the dispenser so it takes two children to hold and aim,” said a dealer at Masjid Bunder.
 
 Sweetmeat sales will rise over Sunday-Monday. North Indians prefer gujiya, Maharashtrians chandrakala and the Rajasthanis and Sindhis must have ghevar. Jhama in Chembur is the one-stop shop for all kinds of  . “We prepare the full range including Sindhi ghear (Rs 500 per kg), Marwari malai ghevar, chandrakala, gujiya, pragri and mawa samosa. All these come for Rs 560 per kg. Sales never dip because it is a tradition to send these sweets to a married daughter’s house,” said Vicky Lulla whose family owns the store.
