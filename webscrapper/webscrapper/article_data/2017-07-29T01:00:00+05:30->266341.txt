'The Vamps' are an in-between band. They don’t have that level of crazy mainstream following like 'One Direction'; a boy band they are always compared with (and detest it). Still, they do sold-out tours and have a fierce fan following which makes us draw obvious comparisons with popular boy bands of the past. 
 
 It is true that they are not an outfit put together by some producer and made into a pop phenomenon like 'Backstreet Boys', 'N-Sync' and others. Each of the boys are talented in their own right, with   on lead vocals and guitar, James McVey rocking the lead guitar and vocals,   who plays bass and Tristan Evans on the drums. Still, the comparison is justified, since they are filling up that void which other popular boy bands left in their wake. And they are loved in our country by a mass of the teenybopper audience. In India, 'The Vamps' are feted by Bollywood personalities like Farah Khan who went on to choreograph a song by them last year. 
 
 In their third album, the boys are trying something different as far as their strategy about releasing the record is concerned. Titled 'Night & Day', the first part released in July is the Night Edition. The Day Edition will release in December this year.
 
 Out of the eight tracks on the ‘Night’ side, they are clearly shifting their sound towards electronic music, collaborating with   on 'Middle Of The Night' which is a generic club number. They’ve jammed with 'Matoma On All Night', which is a slower, more ballad oriented, lyric-heavy song. Another fun   infused track is 'Hands', with Mike Perry and  .
 
 'Same To You' and 'Paper Hearts' lean towards a more acoustic bent, which is where we get to see the band’s strength. The rest of the tracks are forgettable and don’t make any real contribution to their sound. 
 
 Still, for the older listeners, it would be a fun exercise in hearing all the eight tracks as it could prove to be a bridge in the psyche of the current generation of music listeners.
