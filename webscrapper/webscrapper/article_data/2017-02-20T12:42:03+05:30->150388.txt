KOLKATA: A woman crossing the road with her three-year-old daughter managed to save the child from a speeding truck in the nick of time on Sunday, but got seriously injured herself after she could not get out of the way.

 Kabita Agarwal, a homemaker in her mid-20s, was crossing CIT Road at 11.30am — which was fairly empty, at that time — with daughter Gungun to offer puja at a nearby temple. Witnesses later said that she looked a little unmindful. She suddeenly noticed a   thundering towards them, a few metres away.
 
 Agarwal didn’t have — nor, indeed, need — any time to think. Without wasting a moment, realizing there wasn’t enough time to run away from  , she threw the little girl to a side of the road. “The girl was saved, but she was knocked down by the dumpster,” said local councillor Arun Das, who rushed to the spot after being alerted of the accident.
 
 The dumpster moved over Agarwal before the driver could apply the brakes. She got seriously injured, but got saved only because the dumpster has got a good amount of ground clearance, Das said. She was rushed to a south  .
 
 Passersby chased the vehicle and stopped it, and the driver was arrested. 
 
 Locals claimed the driver had been negligent and protested, demanding more police posting in the area. The crowd later turned violent and smashed windshields of a private bus parked nearby. They also blocked the road for a while and demanded more speedbreakers. Debasmita Das, DC (Eastern Suburban Division) rushed to the spot to control the situation. The number of police personnel managing traffic on CIT Road has been increased.
