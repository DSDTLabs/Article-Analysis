BENGALURU: Every third child in India has an unhealthy   ( ), is either   or  , cannot sprint, and lacks adequate upper body strength.

 These are among the findings of the 7th Annual School Health and Fitness Study, 2016, conducted by EduSports, a school sports education company.
 
 Only 68.6% of children in Bengaluru have a healthy BMI, three percentile points higher than the national average of 65%. More girls than boys have a healthy BMI at national and city levels.
 
 In Bengaluru, 75% of girls have a healthy BMI, while the number stands at 66% for boys. Only 66% of children in metros, and 65% of them in non-metros showed a healthy BMI, said the study.
 
 Independent nutritionist Dr Deepak Kulkarni had an interesting explanation for the difference in BMI between boys and girls of the same age. “Boys tend to eat out more than girls and most of the time they eat junk food. This causes boys to be more obese. Girls, especially in their adolescence, tend to be more conscious about their weight and tend to eat less and eat right. This could be the reason why they have the right BMI as compared to the boys,” he said.
 
 Saumil Majumdar, CEO, founder and managing director at EduSports, said: “Everyone agrees that children should play. But the reality is that children are not playing as much as they should. And that is showing up in their poor fitness levels.”
 
 He said there was no need for children to diet or go to gyms. “The only way children can stay fit is by playing. However, this is hard in the urban/semi-urban context where playgrounds are disappearing. Most parents want their children to be fit, but do not know how to help their child stay fit. If schools start integrating sports into education, we will be able to develop a generation of healthy and fit children,” he said.
 
 Kavitha Simha, lead dietician at the department of nutrition and dietetics in   said girls tend to have more body fat than boys, but recent studies have shown a reverse in this trend. “It could be due to the increased interest in sports and physical fitness in girls. Boys tend to be more sedentary and many are addicted to gaming,” she said, adding that childhood obesity is on the rise in Karnataka. “Easy availability of fast food, addiction to TV and gaming are some reasons for poor BMI. Parents have to be role models and get more involved in their child’s nutrition and fitness,” she said.
