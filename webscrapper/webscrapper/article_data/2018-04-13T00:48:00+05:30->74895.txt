Salem: Villagers from Jalagandapuram area in Salem district have sent two pigeons carrying letters to Narendra Modi urging him to constitute the Cauvery Management Board.

 “Our village (Soorapalli) wanted to participate in the protests for the CMB. So, along with Kuppampatty (nearby village), we decided to do it differently by sending letter-carrying pigeons to PM,” said M Suresh, resident of Soorapalli.
 
 To make sure the letters reach the prime minister, the villagers hired two race pigeons, tied them with the letters and released them. Now they are hoping that they reach the destination.
