GAYA: Family members are an invaluable resource for individuals suffering from mental illness, say experts.

 “Family support is a must for the recovery of a mentally ill person and such patients are better placed in India in respect to the western world,” said an expert on mental health Dr Deep Shikha Kavya.
 
 Dr Kavya on Thursday organised an awareness- cum- treatment camp for people suffering from  , one of the most serious mental condition. About 50 persons received counselling and medical advice at the camp organised in the Association of Physicians of India building at Swarajpuri Road
 
 Speaking at the camp Dr Kavya said, “Incidents of mental ailment in India, particularly schizophrenia, is significant and health infrastructure is poor in relation to the number of patients. The major problem is false stigma attached with the mental diseases. At times, people conceal mental ailments at the primary stage and contact psychiatrists only when it is very late.”
 
 “It is a chronic and severe mental illness which affects a person’s ability to think, feel and behave rationally. Patients often fail to understand the reality and have strong beliefs that other people are plotting against them or are trying to hurt them,” she said.
 
 She added that contrary to the popular perception, schizophrenia too is curable but family and society have to be very sensitive and caring for such people. “Society’s attitude towards mentally sick people is generally disdainful, which is not good. About 1% of the Indians suffer from schizophrenia,” said Dr Kavya.
 
 The doctor also added that sleep disorders, violent behaviour, social disconnect, suspicious nature, illogical and incoherent talk among others are few symptoms of schizophrenia.
