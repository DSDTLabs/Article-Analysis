MUMBAI: A foreign   on Wednesday lodged a criminal offence about two   leaves with the same   being deposited with the bank. The bank’s vigilance team has found that one of the cheques was fake, bore a forged signature and the amount of Rs 6.34 lakh was credited to the account of the person who had presented the fake cheque in September last year.

 An officer from Santacruz police station said that RN Exports (buyer), which has its account with the foreign bank, had issued the genuine cheque to Sanghvi & Sons (seller) for a business deal and the latter deposited the cheque in its account. “Before the funds were credited to the seller’s account on September 15, 2016, the fake cheque was presented at the international bank a day earlier. The fake cheque was cleared and the funds credited to the fraudster’s account with a public bank,” said the officer.
 
 As the seller did not receive the funds into his account even a week after having deposited the cheque, the company contacted the buyer. When the foreign bank’s internal team found out that two cheques bearing the same number had been presented, it lodged a police complaint. It says: “It was found that the cheque cleared on September 14, 2016 and credited in a nationalized bank in Santacruz was fake.”
 
 The police said that they suspect it to be an inside job. “An insider who witnessed the deal and was well aware of the date on the cheque got the fake leaf made and also forged the account holder’s signature on it. The fraudster somehow managed to get the cheque cleared just a day before the genuine cheque was presented for clearance,” said the officer, adding that they have sent for the fake instrument to check if it bears the watermark seal of the bank. A case of cheating has been registered.
