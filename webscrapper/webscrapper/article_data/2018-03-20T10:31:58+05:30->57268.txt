BENGALURU: With  , widely known as monkey fever, spreading in Goa and Kerala, Bengaluru-based Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals ( ) — the only lab in the country that produces vaccines to prevent the infection — is scaling up production.

 “We have to augment production of the   as Kyasanur Forest Disease ( ) infection is spreading in other states and the demand is likely to increase in the years to come. We need more facilities and equipment in our lab and will shortly ask the health and family welfare department,” said Dr S M Byregowda, director, IAHVB.
 
 The lab which produced 30,000 vaccine doses in 2000, now manufactures 2 lakh doses, given the spread of the disease. From 2000 till now, IAHVB has produced 12.8 lakh doses of the vaccine. And what was prepared at the cost of Rs 20 per dose, now costs Rs 30. 
 
 Dr Amitha Gomes, scientist, KFD vaccine division of IAHVB, says each vial of the vaccine contains ten doses. “Once the vial is opened, it should be used the same day. The vaccine must be preserved in 2 to 8 degrees centigrade,” she adds.
 
 First seen in 1957 at Kyasanuru village of Soraba taluk, Shivamogga district, the tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever was originally limited to 800 sqkm area of Malnad region, before spreading to five neighbouring states of Karnataka.
 
 Tick population in forests increases between November and March, the same time when KFD cases are also largely seen. People living on the margins of forests and venturing into the wild are vulnerable to the infection. “Karnataka has seen 12 cases in 2018, but no deaths. Those frequenting forests are being vaccinated and awareness programmes being conducted for them,” said Dr Prakash BG, deputy director, national vector borne disease control programme, health and family welfare department.
 
 Both Goa, where 35 people tested positive for KFD, and Kerala have issued alerts to those living close to and frequenting forest areas to get themselves vaccinated.
