CHENNAI: Neither   nor burial of bodies should be at   burial ground, Madras high court has said, adding the   should inspect the spot.

 “Since the property in question is   no further bodies shall be cremated or buried. Chennai Corporation shall inspect the area and investigate as to how many bodies are buried and the area over which the bodies are buried. Such area shall be segregated and the rest may be used by the patta holders,” the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Adbul Quddhose passed the order on a plea moved by the Thuraipakkam Muthanmai Paguthi Kudiyirupor Nala Sangam (Thuraipakkam Residents Welfare Association) on Monday.
 
 The association wanted the court to direct the authorities concerned to remove encroachments made by one of the patta holder   at the burial site. It said the area had been used as burial ground for more than 100 years. While so, Balasubramanian and his men entered the site and demolished a cremation panel constructed by panchayat board.
 
 Though the lands in question were classified as government land, pattas were issued to various villagers who were in continuous enjoyment of the property. However, a portion of the patta lands was used  , it said. Now, claiming to hold patta for the land, Balasubramanian had taken over the possession of the property and demolished the entire burial ground, the association alleged. Responding to the plea, Sholinganallur tahsildar submitted that land was divided into many sub divisions and registered in the name of several persons, including Balasubramanian.
 
 However, a part of the land is used as cremation ground by the villagers, he added.
