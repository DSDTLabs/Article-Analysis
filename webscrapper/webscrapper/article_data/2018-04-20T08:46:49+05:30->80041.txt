AJMER:   Central Jail has a capacity for 900 prisoners but it has 1128 prisoners at present including   and his gang men who were convicted in the Bombay bomb blast case. But the prison staff is woefully inadequate to handle the large numbers inmates who also come from different states like   and Uttar Pradesh. 

 The recovery of mobile phones from the inmates during various inspections gives a window to the sorry state of security.
 
 On April 12 this year, despite jammers and strict security, three mobiles along with sim cards were recovered from different jails. On April 4, seven mobiles were recovered from different barracks when civil lines police inspected the place.
 
 On 15 March this year seven mobiles recovered when jail and police personnel jointly searched the place. There are several occasions when mobiles and sims are seized from the jail. Incidents of drugs seized from prisoners have also come to notice.
 
 The security system is so leaky that last year two hardcore criminals threatened a constable on duty. An official of   (SOG) of Rajasthan was attacked inside the jail when he went to interrogate in a case.
