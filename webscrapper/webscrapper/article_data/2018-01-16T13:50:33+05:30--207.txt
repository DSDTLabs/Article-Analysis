IDUKKI: Despite the synod decision to cut down the   on the controversial land deal and assign auxiliary bishops of the   with more rights, a group of priests is insisting on sending a petition to Pope.

 Earlier, the   requested the priests under the   archdiocese not to go ahead with the decision to send the petition to the Pope. But sources say most of the priests want to send the petition to the Pope.
 
 “The Presbyterian council secretary tried to call a council meeting at the earliest. But the cardinal didn't give permission for it. We will wait some more days and then send the petition and inquiry commission report to the Pope,” said a senior priest belonging to Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, adding that the five-member synod hadn’t given any clean chit to the cardinal in the controversial land deal.
 
 Sources from the church said they hadn’t got a proper answer from the Cardinal on the land deal.
 
 Most of the priests in the church are of the view that the land issue should be reported to the Pope.
 
 “The issue is not just related to money, it is more of a moral issue. The synod has already asked the cardinal not to make any further land deals. The Presbyterian council had earlier decided to send a petition to the Pope. Till now, there is no change in the decision,” said a senior priest.
 
 “The Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese aims at reducing the power of the cardinal and give more powers to the auxiliary bishops in the archdiocese. We hope the land deal issue will be solved early,” said senior priest belonging to   diocese, adding that the inquiry report and evidence were totally against the cardinal. In the present situation, the synod can't give a clean chit to him, he said.
 
 The land deal had earned the wrath of a section of priests and laity, after a church committee found that it caused a loss of at least Rs 60 crore to the archdiocese.
