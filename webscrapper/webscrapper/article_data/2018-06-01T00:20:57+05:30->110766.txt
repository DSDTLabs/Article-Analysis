Pune: The Bombay high court on Wednesday told the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to file an affidavit by June 11 explaining the steps it has taken on the merger proposal of Pune-based Rupee Co-operative Bank.   had sought time to file the affidavit.

 “Let the affidavit be filed by June 11,” the HC vacation bench of Justice Nitin Sambre and Justice Prakash D Naik said in an order, while posting the matter for next hearing date on June 13.
 
 In September 2017, the RBI had sought three months to consider the proposals submitted by three banks — Janseva Sahakari Bank Ltd, TJSB Sahakari Bank Ltd and Saraswat Co-operative Bank Ltd — evincing their interest in taking over of the ailing  . In December again, the RBI had sought eight more weeks and the same was granted.
 
 On Wednesday, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis appealed to RBI representatives to positively consider the proposal of TJSB and treat the merger proposal on par with how it treats the mergers of a co-operative bank with that of a commercial bank.
 
 “The RBI was asking for a few more months to consider the proposal but the court told them to come back with their view by June 11, 2018…hopefully they will settle this soon,” said Hrishikesh Jalgaonkar, joint secretary, Rupee Co-operative Bank employees’ union.
