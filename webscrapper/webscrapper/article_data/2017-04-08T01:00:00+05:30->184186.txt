It was quite an unusual sight when  , the 240-feet Qutub Minar, was lit up in blue to spread awareness about   on  . The Autism Centre for Excellence (ACE), a school for autistic children, in association with the   ( ) and National Trust, Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disability, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, got together to light up the monument as part of the international   campaign.

 
 Archana Nayar, who is the founder of ACE, was also present when the heritage site turned blue. "Doesn't it look lovely," she asked, and added, "It is one of the most iconic landmarks in the city. Everyone knows about it. The idea was â€“ if we turn it blue, people will question, 'Why has it been turned blue?' And this 'why' would bring people's attention to autism."

  Usually closed for entry after dusk, the entry to the heritage site was reopened for general public at 7.30pm. People who knew about the cause and also those who did not came to see the lit up Minar. While some clicked selfies with the lit-up monument, others were just overwhelmed to see the site.
 
 
 Saumya Moorli, a resident of Sector 57, Gurgaon, who also came to see the heritage site, told us, "I have never seen the Qutub Minar in this way. It looks lovely today. I think this is one of those moments that you just can't miss!"
 
  Yogesh Kataria, a   resident, added, "I have come here with my family. I am a student of Fine Arts and I keep coming here to draw various shades of the site, but I have never experienced or seen it in this way."
