BELAGAVI: Following stiff opposition from environmentalists and ornithologists,   (BCC) has shelved its plans to erect a statue of the Buddha, and install an 85ft-tall flagpost ­ touted to be the highest in the country -in the island on   in the city. The tiny island is home to as many as 45 different avian species, and the  's plans to have a Buddha statue and a flagpost built on the verdant island could have rendered these birds homeless.

 TOI had published a report outlining the possible ecological damage that the project would entail. Indian spot billed duck, pond heron, little egret, white throated kingfisher are some of the birds that can be spotted regularly on the island.
 
 The erection of the statue and installation of the flagpost were estimated to cost Rs 1 crore. BCC announced that the work would be taken up under the chief minister's Rs 100 crore special fund. Environmentalists and bird lovers were vocal in expressing their opposition to the BCC's plans, which they pointed out, would destroy the avian habitat. The BCC has now decided to have the flagpost installed in front of the amphitheatre outside the lake, while the Buddha's statue will be erected on the lake.
 
 Lauding the BCC for paying heed to the pleas of bird lovers, environmentalist   said, “Fort Lake is one of the few natural heritage sites in the city. I am grateful to the BCC for changing its plans to save the trees on the island.“
 
 BCC's engineer RS   told TOI that besides the ecological cost, the difficulty in installing a flagpost on the island, the soil of which was not feasible also necessitated the change in their plans. “We would have had to cut all trees on the island for the project. But we have decided to change the location. We have called tenders for the project, and work will start once they have been finalized,“ Naik said.
