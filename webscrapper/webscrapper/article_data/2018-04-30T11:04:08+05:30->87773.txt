BENGALURU: The ongoing verbal duel between chief minister   and JD(S) state president   over the latter’s secret pact with   hit a new high on Sunday, with Siddaramaiah claiming in Belagavi that he has proof to show that the former CM and and BJP national president   travelled in the same flight to Delhi and met many leaders there.

 
 “I can get proof of their visit and meetings,” he told reporters. Asked why he isn’t making the proof public, he said he’d do it at an appropriate time.
 
 Rubbishing the CM’s claim, Kumaraswamy dared him to release the proof immediately. “Why will I meet Shah? What is stopping him from releasing the proof which he is claiming to have,” Kumaraswamy retorted.
 
 Meanwhile, JD(S) went a step ahead and released ‘fake’ travel details of Siddaramaiah and BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan, who deserted JD(S) to join   recently, to Karachi on February 13. “We have sent this fake document to show that such documents can be created by anybody to malign opponents,” said Kumaraswamy’s media coordinator Sadanand.
 
 Hours after the CM’s claim, tickets showing Shah and Kumaraswamy having travelled from Benglauru to Delhi went viral. But the veracity of the tickets could not be verified.
 
 
 
 BJP national president Amit Shah dismissed the CM’s charge and told reporters in Benglauru, “It is far from the truth. I have not met Kumaraswamy.” He also said the denial of ticket to BS Yeddyurappa’s son, B Y Vijayendra, from Varuna was his decision.
 
 Shah also said he is going to Ballari to campaign for the party candidates.
