NAVI MUMBAI: An IMD warning about a hailstorm on Friday and Saturday has grape farmers in the nation’s vineyard, Nashik, losing sleep with harvesting being done round the clock to avoid loss of crop.

 As per the IMD forecast, gusty winds, lightning, hail and thunderstorms are expected over isolated places in the northern districts of Madhya  , including Pune, Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nashik as well as  , between February 23 and 24.
 
 Nashik collector B Radhakrishnan told TOI, “An awareness campaign has been telecast on television and farmers are taking all precautionary steps.”
 
 According to district agriculture department estimates Nashik exports one lakh metric tonne of grapes. “This is 80% of the total exports of grapes from Maharashtra. Currently, harvest has been advanced by two-three days as this is export variety crop and it has specifications of sweetness and size and time of harvesting is determined in advance to suit requirements of foreign markets. The grapes are being harvested a trifle earlier in view of the hailstorm warning,” said an official.
 
 The crop for the domestic market has a higher grade of sweetness. With heat increasing from February onward, the crop from early November to March-April is harvested for domestic consumers.
 
 Dilip Zende, joint agriculture director said, “Bunches that were not ready or those that will be plucked later were covered with plastic cones.”
 
 Vineyards are developed in rows and plastic cover was also put on scaffolding to protect crop from hailstorm damage.
