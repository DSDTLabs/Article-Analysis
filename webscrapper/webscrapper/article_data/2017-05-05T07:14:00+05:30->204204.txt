Bathinda: The CPI (ML) Liberation and Mazdoor Mukti Morcha on Thursday held a protest at Rampura Phool Sadar police station to demand arrest of a head teacher for allegedly slapping a Dalit woman teacher and trying to sexually harass her. 

 A case has been registered against government high school, Kararwala village, head teacher Raghbir Singh. The latter has termed the accusations as false. Officials confirmed that the district education authorities are investigating the matter.
 
 Mazdoor Mukti Morcha state secretary Bhagwant Singh Samao and CPI(ML) Liberation district secretary Harwinder Sema said that, “Head teacher of government high school Kararwala village in Bathinda on February 21, 2017, had slapped Dalit teacher Varinder Kaur and passed castiest remarks against her. She approached the police with a complaint but when nobody listened to her, the teacher approached us and we took up the matter with the police. Though the police have registered a case on May 2 but have not arrested him.”
 
 Raghbir Singh, however, said that the accusations were false and the issue was unnecessarily being given the shape of anti-Dalit, which is not true. “I had not slapped or made any casteist remarks against the teacher,” he added. 
 
 Rampura Phool sadar police station SHO Balwinder Singh said that, “A case against head teacher Raghbir Singh has been registered under the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act and on charges of criminal intimidation. The district authorities are investigating the matter and he could be arrested if found guilty.”
