PUNE: A 34-year-old software engineer, his wife and four-year-old son were found dead inside their flat on the second floor of a housing society on   link road on Thursday night.

 Police said Jayesh Patel and his wife, Bhumika, 30, may have hanged themselves after their four-year-old ailing son   passed away.
 
  “The postmortems confirmed that Patel and his wife died due to hanging. We do not know the cause of the boy’s death. His viscera has been preserved,” Dayanand  , senior inspector of   police, told TOI. Patel was from Ahmedabad and had been working with a Yerawada-based prominent software company for the past two years. Four months ago, the family moved to their own flat in   society. Patel had not reported to work for the last two days. He did not respond to calls on his cellphone from his colleagues and friends.
 
 “On Thursday morning, Patel’s friends came to his flat. They found the door locked from inside and two-day-old newspapers in the corridor,” a society resident said. These friends visited the flat several times during the day. “When they did not get any response till late in the evening, they contacted the chairman and the committee members of the society,” he said.“A security guard got into the Patels’ balcony from the terrace of a first-floor flat and saw Patel’s wife and son on a bed in one of the two bedrooms and Patel on the ground with a rope around his neck. Half the rope was still hanging from the ceiling fan,” Dhome said. The committee members alerted the police.
 
 Inspector Dhome said they found ligature marks around the necks of Patel and his wife. Their son was foaming in the mouth. They did not find any suicide note.
