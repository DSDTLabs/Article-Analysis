PATNA: Patna will soon have its own avatar of Bandra-Worli Sea Link with the government setting the deadline of 2021 for readying the Kachchi Dargah- Bidupur   over the Ganga.

 Touted as the longest river bridge in India, the six-lane stretch connecting Patna and Vaishali will be of 22.76km, including the main bridge length of 9.76km. It will connect the Patna- Bakhtiarpur NH-30 on the south and the NH-103 at Gazipur Chowk in Vaishali.
 
 Work on 30 of the bridgeâ€™s 87 pillars are currently going on. Sources said on Friday the construction of segments or spans would begin in June. The cable-laying work on the superstructure of this suspended-cable bridge will start by the year-end.
 
 The   State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL) is the executing agency of the road construction department. The corporation officials told TOI the construction work of approach road from Patna end was likely to commence within a couple of months. The length of the approach road on Patna end will be 1.5km and that on Vaishali end 8.5km.
 
 State road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav, who inspected the under-construction bridge on Thursday, said vehicular movement would start on the bridge by 2021.
 
 Chief minister   commissioned the bridge construction work on January 31, 2016. The project is estimated to cost Rs 4,988.4 crore, including Rs 3,000-crore loan from the Asian Development Bank.
 
 The minister said one lane of the bridge would go to the riverine area in Vaishali, where people currently use country boats to come to Patna.
 
 The bridge is being constructed by Korean firm   as a joint venture with L&T India. The salient features of the bridge include a highway museum, intelligent traffic system and automated toll plazas.
