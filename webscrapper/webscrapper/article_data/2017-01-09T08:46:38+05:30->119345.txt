NEW DELHI: A 38-year-old former merchant navy officer staged a dance of death at his east Delhi apartment on Sunday afternoon as he went on a stabbing spree in a bid to kill his 60-year-old father. 

 The man allegedly first tried to attack the society guard before stabbing his father 36 times inside his flat. When the father tried to escape, he was chased and stabbed as he crawled all the way to the guardroom downstairs.
 
 The sequence was captured by   cameras. The suspect,  , then rushed upstairs and allegedly stabbed a woman neighbour in her flat. But it didn't end there. He then tried to take another neighbour hostage and locked himself in his house.
 
 When cornered by police, the man switched on the LPG supply and blew up the flat, injuring at least nine policemen who had arrived at the scene of the mayhem. The man was rescued from the burning flat after an hour long drama. Police will interrogate him upon discharge.
 
 Rahul, who had been sacked from the merchant navy and jailed twice, had been disowned by his father,  , a fortnight ago and forced to vacate the house.
