HYDERABAD: PNB scamster Mehul Choksi-owned Gitanjali Group’s Hyderabad Gems   Ltd refused to comply with orders of SEZ development commissioner, who instructed them to set up a goldtesting machine and related equipment to check quality of imported raw material and check finished products, including diamonds and gems for export.

 Ministry of commerce issued orders to all gems and jewellery SEZs to install goldtesting equipment and diamond quality-checking apparatus.
  
  
 “Following the ministry’s orders in 2017, we asked Hyderabad Gems SEZ to set up the gold testing machine. The SEZ replied they don’t much deal with gold, but more with silver, so equipment not installed. A firm,   (not belonging to Gitanjali group) has set up a unit and we hope it would be installed,” SEZ development commissioner,   said.
 
 Ministry of commerce had asked SEZs to set up this equipment as there are no experts. And customs officials depend on information in books provided by SEZ in determining quality and quantity of gold, gems and jewellery, which also leads to cooking up of books.
 
 “Hyderabad Gems SEZ informed us they deal more with silver and investment of few lakh rupees in buying the equipment would be a burden,” SEZ deputy development commissioner Srinivas said.
 
 Three firms — Gitanjali Gems, Gili India and   — have been named in   case by Central Bureau of Investigation.
 
 Enforcement Directorate launched searches in the SEZ and sealed units. The five units at the SEZ are Gitanjali Gems, Bezel Jewellery, Nakshatra World Limited, Nakshatra Brands Limited, Gili India Limited. Now, ED is assessing the value with approved valuators and checking allegations that Rs 3800 crore of book value of stocks in SEZ is inflated
