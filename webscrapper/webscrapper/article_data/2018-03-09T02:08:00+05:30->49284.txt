A mere 0.2% was all that came between him and the chief minister's chair in the 2014 elections for Y S Jaganmohan Reddy. That razor thin difference in vote share made a big difference in the number of seats it could garner. Out of the 175 assembly seats, the TDP won a comfortable 102 seats but YSRCP was left far behind with only 67. It is another matter that several YSRCP legislators switched loyalties and became part of the ruling TDP.   set his eyes on 2019 polls without any delay. In his latest attempt at mass contact, he has already covered 1400 km in 107 days. 

 Y S Rajasekhara Reddy had walked 1470 km in 63 days in 2003 in undivided Andhra Pradesh which connected him to the masses. In the polls held in 2004, the Congress won and he became chief minister. Jagan is now on a 3000-km walk interacting with the masses. His public meetings have huge attendance. That is giving him hope of victory in the 2019 elections. Jagan did draw huge crowds before the 2014 polls too but could not get enough seats to form a government. In several seats, his candidates lost by a small margin. During a 208-day padayatra that ended in 2013, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu had walked 2,800 km and in the 2014 elections, his party rode to power. Jagan's sister Y S Sharmila too had covered 2,500 km in a padayatra that she undertook covering it in 188 days during 2012-13. 
 
 On the very day that his father Y S Rajasekhara Reddy died on September 2, 2009 in a helicopter crash, Jaganmohan Reddy made it clear that he was the heir to the throne. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, however, installed senior Congressman K Rosaiah as chief minister. That was not to Jaganmohan Reddy's liking. He quit the Congress and launched the YSRCP. Polls 2014 showed where he stood. It was close, yet so far. 
 
 The souring of relationship between the BJP and TDP is a matter for delight for Jaganmohan Reddy as he can hope for the scenario to swing in his favour in the 2019 polls. But he will also have to reckon with the presence of Jana Sena Party. JSP's Pawan Kalyan is inimical to Jagan's aspirations and friendly with TDP's Chandrababu Naidu.
