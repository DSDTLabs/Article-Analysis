Chandigarh: The remark of senior vice-president, Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) Didar Singh Nalwi, saying the organisation is headed in the wrong direction brings infighting to fore.  Speaking to TOI, Nalwi alleged violation of the act which governs the ad-hoc body and the “dictatorial functioning” of office-bearers. “For the fourth consecutive year, the committee’s office-bearers failed to provide the audit report of works and financial functions,” Nalwi alleged, adding that not a single audit report had been submitted since the consititution of the HSGMC in July 2014. Nalwi said, “It is clear that the committee is deviating from its basic principles and the act governing the body.” Questioning the role of HSGMC president Jagdish Singh Jhinda and his team, he said, “Jhinda has not changed his style of functioning despite repeated reminders.” When contacted, Jhinda rubbished the allegations levelled by Nalwi. “The committee is working properly and there are no financial issues. Nalwi is not a well-wisher of the committee. He raises issues only on the directions of certain vested interests. He chaired a meeting of the committee recently and could have asked for any subject instead of going out and expressing his views,” said Jhinda.
