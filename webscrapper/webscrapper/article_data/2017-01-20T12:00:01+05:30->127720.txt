ONGOLE: Crops in over four lakh acres are withering away in   due to  . Cotton, chilli, red gram, Bengal gram and black gram are the  . 

 Though the authorities allocated 5.5 tmcft to meet the water needs of the district, farmers in the tail-end areas are yet to see a drop of water in the canals from Nagarjuna Sagar. Tobacco growers, who faced the worst crisis in the last two years due to a steep fall in the price, are in trouble for yet another year as the leaves are losing sheen and colour.
 
 The district received 13 mm rainfall as against 144 mm in November when the rabi season began. Despite the adverse monsoon, the farmers went ahead with sowing in the hope of having a good rainfall in December. But, it wasn't to be.
 
 A worried district administration sent an SOS to the government, seeking release of 8 tmcft from Sagar to save the standing crops. But the state government, which secured a share of 35 tmcft from Krishna water, allocated 5.5 tmcft for Prakasam district.
 
 The authorities, however, could tap only 4 tmcft which wasn't sufficient for the farmers as it took longer duration to reach the tail-end areas. "I was compelled to water plants with tankers spending about Rs 20,000 per acre," Nallapati Venkatramaiah, a farmer Konakanamitla village, told TOI. 
 
 Water stress is felt mainly in Darsi, Podili, Kurichedu, Mundlamuru, Addanki, Chimakurthy, Santhamagulur, Maddipadu, Talluru and Santhanuthalapadu mandals. "Two lakh acres in Darsi division alone are affected badly," a senior official said.
 
 Transport minister Sidda Raghava Rao, who represents Darsi constituency, said efforts were on to supply additional water to the district to save the crops.
