SHIMLA: During discussion on budget in the assembly on Friday, chief minister   accused the previous Congress regime of wasteful expenditure. He said Congress had used state-run HRTC buses to ferry people for party president Rahul Gandhi’s rally in Mandi on October 7, 2017 and footed Rs 75 lakh bill to the exchequer. Accusing the Thakur of politicizing the speech, Congress legislators staged a walkout from the House in the middle of his speech.

 In his reply to budget discussion, Thakur referred to the issue of loans taken by his government. He said loans obtained would not be spent on wasteful expenditure. He said that during previous Congress regime, wasteful expenditure was unstoppable and cited the instance of Rahul Gandhi’s rally in Mandi. He said the rally was held in Mandi and to mobilize the crowd, HRTC buses were pressed into service. He said Rs 75 lakh fare of buses was paid by the state exchequer despite it being a Congress rally. The chief minister said he had just received the file related to the payment to HRTC by the state government. 
 
 He said there were lot many other examples to show how the previous government indulged in wasteful expenditure. 
 
  leader   asked him to tell about the rallies of Prime Minister   and money spent on those. When Thakur countered, asking him to name one such rally, Agnihotri said the CM was politicizing the budget speech. He said that educated youth were promised government jobs but no provision had been made in the budget. He said that budget was anti-development and anti-youth. 
 
 When Thakur was talking about unemployment allowance given to small number of youth in previous Congress regime, opposition members started creating a ruckus in the House and then walked out in protest.
