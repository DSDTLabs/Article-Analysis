Panchkula:   menace has become a major challenge for the   administration. Despite a meeting held by Panchkula deputy commissioner Gauri Prasher Joshi on September 8 to discuss the issue, no change has been witnessed on the streets of Panchkula.

 However, municipal corporation (MC) councillors and local residents alleged that involvement of officials from administration at ground level with the local diary owners has lead to the problem to become aggravated. 
 
 Residents also alleged that officers are responsible for not taking any action against the owners of stray cattle, which have been roaming throughout the city roads.
 
 Councilor Ravi Kant Swami said, “I have called local concerned officials several times to catch the stray cattle roaming on the street and to take action against their owners but to no avail. It clearly shows that they are hand in gloves with the dairy owners. Some strict action needs to be taken by the officers at ground level.”
 
 Joshi, in the meeting conducted on September 8, gave directions to the officials to take strict action against the owners of stray cattle, who let their animals wander on the roads. DC especially asked MC officials to form a team and start working to ensure that the animals do not come on the roads.
 
 Similarly MC mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia took a meeting in January, in which she asked the officials to register an FIR against the dairy owner, whose cattle was found roaming on the streets of the city. Ahluwalia said, “We have given warning to the dairy owners to not let their cattle out on the road otherwise a strict action would be taken against them.”
 
 “Despite repeated warnings to the dairy owners, how are the stray cattle roaming on the streets. Either the officials are not working properly or the dairy owners are not afraid of the officials,” said president of resident welfare association R K Aggarwal.
