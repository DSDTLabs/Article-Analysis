BENGALURU: The proposed innovative funding policy by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation limited (BMRCL) for the purpose of Phase 2A and Phase 3 has raised concerns among a few central government top officials over whether it can succeed when it failed for the  .

 At a review meeting of the   by Union Minister for statstics and programme implementation, D V  , it is said a few central government officials questioned whether the innovative funding will indeed work while having failed in the construction of the Delhi metro rail.
 
 However, defending the BMRCL proposal, Karnataka minister for large and medium industries R V Deshpande said the innovative funding policy in Bengaluru was particularly strong as the Metro line which is being proposed under the policy is primarily the Information Technology and Bio Technology companies belt which are invested in the development of the infrastructure.
 
 Deshpande also added that the private companies have in fact come forward volunatrily to contribute for the project.
 
 Addressing the media, both the state and central government ministers including Gowda, Deshpande and Bengaluru development minister K J George said the innovative funding model will be embarked upon by providing benefits to the companies in terms of higher floor space index (FSI) and other concessions.
 
 “But people will have to wait as the state government is still in the process of finalising the policy,” said Gowda.
 
 The state government and BMRCL is said to be looking at raising at least Rs 2,000 crore from innovative funding and seek the rest from state government for the Phase 2A metro line between Silk board and K R Puram. The total cost of the project is Rs 4,200 crore, with the state and BMRCL hoping that the centre will chip in with another Rs 500 crore or more for the said extension line of the namma metro.
