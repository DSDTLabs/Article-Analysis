MADURAI: Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s image should find a place along with that of Mahatma Gandhi on the currency notes,   and its trade union wing   (TUCC) have demanded.

 The parties raised the demand in ‘Madurai declaration’, which was released at the end of a two-day meeting attended by Samajwadi Forward Bloc’s chairman   and TUCC chairman P Narayanaswamy.
 
 The declaration urged the government to announce January 23, the birthday of Bose, as the ‘patriots day’. It also wanted to bring the ashes of Bose from Japan and scatter it in rivers, mountains, valleys, seas and forests in India. “The government should unravel the mysteries surrounding his death. The Madurai airport should be named after  , who was one of the members of Netaji-founded Forward Bloc,” the declaration said.
 
 Expressing concerns about farmers, the declaration said the government should frame a policy for them. “Farmers should enjoy 50% profit on their produce. The government should also bring a separate budget for the agriculture sector,” it said.
 
 Those who are unemployed, between the age of 24-65 should be given a job card that would ensure work for 250 days. “They should be paid Rs 500 per day as wages and should be given training in skill development. They should be given Rs 1,000 as pocket money per month till they get a job. Besides, the number of days under the employment guarantee scheme should be increased to 250 days from 100 days,” the declaration added.
