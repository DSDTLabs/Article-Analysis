AHMEDABAD: The   government has deferred implementation of its decision to make   compulsory in all schools from class I. The government had earlier in March announced that Gujarati language was compulsory, from class I at all schools in the state, affiliated with all education boards, including  , ICSE and IGCSE as well as in English medium and non-Gujarati medium schools.

 Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said that “We have decided to defer the implementation of the decision to make Gujarati compulsory in CBSE, ICSE and IGSCE schools. The schools affiliated to Gujarat board will implement the decision from this academic year beginning from June. We have decided to defer the decision till Diwali, as the schools will have to appoint new teachers and will also have to get their books ready.”
 
 Educators have already criticised the decision and said that at present, Hindi and English are taught at CBSE affiliated schools from class I and introducing a third language from class I will put immense burden on students. At CBSE schools, a third language is introduced from class VI, so students can learn the extra language at a proper age. “This is a very welcome move by the state government as when you are living in a state you should be familiar with the local language,” said Shobha Tyagi, director of Maharaja Agrasen Vidyalaya, Ahmedabad.
 
 “Gujarati is already there as optional subject in senior classes, so we have sufficient staff to introduce the subject in class I and II according to the instructions of the government,” said Pragya Pandya, principal, St Kabir.
