PANCHKULA: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Panchkula directed a mobile insurance company to pay Rs 5,000 compensation, Rs 5,000 cost of litigation and refund Rs 52,500 as per terms of contract to a   woman for denying the claim of a phone.

  Sharma, a resident of Harmilap Nagar, Baltana SAS Nagar, Mohali filed a complaint with forum citing that she purchased an Apple I phone 6 on April 30, 2015 from Current Technology Retail, Sector 11, Panchkula, who is an authorized dealer of apple products. She took an insurance against the damage after paying Rs 2,899 from One Assist  , Andheri, Mumbai.
 
 Alisha alleged that the insurance company ignored her and did not entertain her when she approached the Mumbai-based firm to provide help as her phone developed some problem.
 
 The forum sent a notice to One Assist Consumer Solution to appear before the forum but no one came to represent them .
 
 The forum observed the case and subsequently stated that no representation in the matter clearly shows they have nothing to say in their defence.
 
 Thus, forum directed One Assist Pvt Ltd to pay Rs 52,500 to Alisha as per terms and conditions for the protection/insurance cover and Rs 5,000 as compensation for mental agony, physical harassment and inconvenience caused to the complainant and further an amount of Rs 5,000 towards cost of litigation.
