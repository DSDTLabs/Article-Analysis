CHENNAI: The DMK has strengthened its   (IT) wing by appointing new office-bearers for 65 DMK districts and assembly constituencies. The IT wing, headed by Madurai Central   PTR  , has appointed 429 graduates and post-graduates. They will in turn help fill the vacancies right up to the booth level. 

 Soon after his appointment as IT wing chief last year, Thiagarajan, a financial analyst by profession, submitted a plan to DMK working president   and other senior leaders to revamp the party’s IT wing. Stalin asked Thiagarajan to choose the office-bearers.
 
 “Following Stalin’s orders, I toured all the districts and conducted interviews. The criteria for becoming a member of the IT wing is that he or she must have cleared plus-two and must be tech-savvy with wide knowledge in use of mobiles and computer,” said Thiagarajan. The prospective members were asked to register their names with full resume online. “We verified all the names and their educational qualifications through party’s district secretaries. Scores were given on various parameters. 
 
 We interviewed them and short-listed names for appointment as DMK district IT coordinator, two deputy coordinators and an assembly coordinator,” said Thiagarajan. The individuals, who have been appointed, are mostly post graduates, PhD holders, engineers or those who have completed MBA and MCA. “The appointees will pick up suitable coordinators for wards, panchayats and booths. All those who have been appointed are employed elsewhere and will will also be involved in party work,” the MLA said.
 
 The party was keen on a young IT wing. “We have chosen only individuals who are in the age group of 27 to 30 years to be IT wing office-bearer. There are some exceptions but they are in minority. The IT wing has also an App for exclusive use of its members. It is through this App we will be coordinating with each other,” Thiagarajan said.
