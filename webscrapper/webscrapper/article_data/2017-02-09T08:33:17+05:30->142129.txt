HYDERABAD: The Centre and the   are coming together to   that was once common in the villages of  

 The central government is sponsoring the distribution of lakhs of young chicks, that too native breeds, to beneficiaries, especially from the SCST communities. This is expected to boost economic activity and solve the issue of protein deficiency. Commercial poultry business had robbed the villages of backyard poultry cul ture, animal husbandry director Dr D Venkateshwarly told TOI. “There was a time when country chicken and eggs were transported from villages to the towns. There is a complete role reversal now,“ he said.
 
 The Centre and state will distribute 45 birds (20 females and 25 males) to each beneficiary . Though the Centre has decided to distribute one-day-old chicks, the state animal husbandry department will rear them for four weeks before passing them on to reduce mortality rates. The chicks as well as enclosures will be given at a highly subsidised ra te. However, the scheme will not focus on providing feed as it is aimed at rearing poultry the traditional way . Country chicken generally grow strong from food readily available in the backyard.
 
 “The beneficiaries can sell the eggs. The price of country chicken eggs are higher than commercial ones. They can also sell the chicken provided they keep sufficient numbers for breeding. Local gram panchayats will monitor the programme,“ said veterinary assistant surgeon Dr Sachin.The scheme has already been implemented in Nalgonda.
