AHMEDABAD: A tuition class owner, Girishkumar Patel of Ramol, has alleged that his student   has duped him of Rs 50,000.   police said they found the address mentioned by Pal to be false. Patel runs a tuition class named   class at   in Ramol. “Pal had taken admission in his tuition class in October 2016 to study accounts and statistics,” said a police official.

  On November 11, when Patel was going to his bank to deposit Rs 50,000 in   of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, Pal approached him and urged him to give the money as she was in urgent need. “Pal also said that her husband is working with a private bank and she would return the money in new currency notes soon. Hence Patel gave her the money,” said a police official.
 
  According to the complaint, Pal continued classes till November 17, and then suddenly stopped coming. “When Patel called up her on her cellphone, she promised to pay the money in two days. Thereafter both Pal and her husband bluntly denied Patel about paying back the money and dared him to do anything he could,” said the official. “We are tracking her and her husband,” added the official.
