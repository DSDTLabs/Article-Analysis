BHOPAL: Congress MLA from Ater in Bhind  , who is on the run after a case of rape and abduction case was filed against him by Bhopal police, moved the MP high court on Saturday seeking quashing of charges against him. 

 Claiming innocence and alleging that he was implicated by certain officials, a video was posted by Katare. 
 
 Counsel for Katare, Priyanshu Jain moved two separate petitions in the high court seeking quashing of both the FIRs against him and a stay on Katare's arrest. 
 
 Katare's local lawyer,  , when asked on what ground his client had sought quashing of FIR, said "We have taken the plea that both Katare and the girl in question are adults, and, if they were in a relationship, there is nothing illegal about it. But, if the girl starts blackmailing him afterwards once their relation goes sour, what could have he done except seeking police help. It was what he did and whatever action was taken against the girl, it was by the police after verification of my client's complaint. The money was arranged in consultation with them and she was called. After being arrested, she is complaining of rape and illegal confinement. It's absurd and therefore, the FIR against Karate should be quashed,"
 
 Karate was booked for rape after a journalism student was caught by the crime branch on the charge of blackmailing Katare, had sent an application to DIG, Bhopal, from jail accusing him of rape. 
 
 An FIR was lodged against Katare at Mahila Thana on the charge of rape while another FIR was lodged by the girl's mother at Bajaria police station charging Katare of illegal confinement and rape.
 
 After failing to find Katare, Bhopal police had announced a reward of Rs 10,000 on information leading to his arrest on Saturday.
