BATHINDA: Hope of a good yield has led to prices of cotton nosediving by Rs 300-400 per quintal over the past fortnight. It comes as a bolt from the blue for the cotton farmers who had to struggle with pest attacks in previous seasons.

 Cotton prices, which were hovering at Rs 4,550-4,650 per quintal at the start of the season in mid-September, have now come down to Rs 4,200-4,300. Market experts say these can go down further when the arrival starts picking up around Diwali across the country.
 
 The rise in acreage than the previous year and a bumper crop are seen as the biggest factors that can see the cotton prices stabilizing at around or even lower than the   (MSP). The MSP for the medium staple fibre of 27.5-28.5mm length which is produced in Punjab is Rs 4,020 per quintal. Going by the prices in the previous year when it touched Rs 5,500-5,600, the cotton growers were expecting handsome prices this year, as well but now are feeling the pinch.
 
 After spending more on pesticides and insecticides for fear of pest attack on cotton crop, the cotton growers of Punjab facing double whammy of higher input costs and  .
 
 “Cotton was sown in 108.5 lakh hectares in the country in the previous season and in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan it was sown in 12.5 lakh hectares. This time, the acreage increased to 123 lakh hectares across the country and in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan it increased to 16 lakh hectares,” said Vardhman Textiles’ director raw material I J Dhuria.
 
 “Last year, nearly 45 lakh bales (one bale=170 kg) were produced in the three state, it is expected to increase to 60 lakh bales. In the country, 350 lakh bales were produced last season and the number is expected to reach 385 lakh bales. Total consumption in India is of around 320-325 lakh bales. So we will be having over 60 lakh bales as surplus. This factor has brought down the prices,” he added.
 
 Cotton trading body   (ICAL) president Rakesh Rathi said that due to expectation of nearly 35 lakh more bales the prices have come down and may slip further. “When the arrival had started in mid-September the prices were Rs 4,500-4,600 due to very short supply and now when arrival has stated it has come down with expectation of bumper crop. If exports take place only then prices are expected to increase,” Rathi added.
 
 At present, nearly 4,500-5,000 bales are arriving in Punjab mandis every day and till now nearly 60,000 bales have already arrived in the mandis. As against the 8.90 lakh bales procured last year in Punjab, this time nearly 12.5 lakh bales are expected in the state. The cotton has been sown in 3.82 lakh hectares whereas last year it was sown in 2.57 lakh hectares. The yield is expected to be nearly 9 quintals per acre, according to agriculture department officials.
 
 “We were expecting rates to remain above Rs 5,000 per quintal but these have come down by nearly Rs 800 per quintal. Even though we do not want to sell the crop at these prices but with no other option,” said cotton grower Rashpal Singh of village Jiwan Singh Wala and Mohinder Singh of Kot Shamir, while taking tractor load of cotton to Bathinda mandi.
 
 “We had to spend extra on pesticides for fear of pest attack and despite the increase in input cost we are losing on price. The Union government need to increase the MSP to Rs 4,500-4,600 so that we may get some profit,” said cotton grower Balwant Singh of village Sangat, who has brought his produce to at Bathinda mandi.
