Panaji: Urban development minister Francis D’Souza on Tuesday directed mayor Vithal Chopdekar and commissioner, corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP), Ajit Roy not to issue licences to any more eating outlets — gaddas and hotels — and to be strict with those operating illegally. D’Souza, who addressed a meeting called at the insistence of Panaji Hotel and Traders Association (PHATA), told TOI, “So many hotels and gaddas should able to sustain themselves. The carrying capacity of the city has to also be considered.” The urban development minister added that he had addressed the association’s complaint about many small eateries operating without the mandatory NOC from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). Bernard Sapeco, who led the delegation, said they want the CCP to crackdown on the many illegal gaddas operating freely in the capital city. “We will ensure that they are closed down,” he added. Other issues raised by the association during their last meeting with the minister were also discussed on Tuesday. With regards to their complaint of repeated human interface required in getting permissions from the CCP, D’Souza said the issue would be resolved once the corporation begins issuing permissions/licences online. “I agree that human interface has to be reduced,” he said. With regards to the associations complaint about the high rate of taxes charged, D’Souza said he has asked the mayor and commissioner to submit a report on the same within two months.
