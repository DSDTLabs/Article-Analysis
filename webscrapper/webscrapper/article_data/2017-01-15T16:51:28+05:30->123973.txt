Balakrishna’s landmark film,   directed by Krish Jagarlamudi and starring Shriya Saran and Hema Malini as well has hit the screens and is doing great at the box office. The film has already become the biggest opener for both the hero and the director with 18 crores. While that was the case on Day One, the festival and weekend added to its collections manifold. Day three after the film’s release has summed up to 48 crores by now. The film collected 18 crores plus 8 crores oversees on Day 1, 20 crores and 5 crores overseas on Day two and 10 crores so far on Day three. 

  The film is going steady in terms of box office collections. Although it is doing well on the A centres, it isn’t matching up at the B and C centres. However, the film is certainly a movie that both the actor and director would be proud of.
