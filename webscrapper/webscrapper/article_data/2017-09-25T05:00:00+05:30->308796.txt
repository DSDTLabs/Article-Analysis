Content still remains the key for the success of a movie, and if you can’t come up with a good story, your fate is written on the wall,” said   as the packed auditorium on the   campus in Gachibowli listened with rapt attention. The   filmmaker was addressing the ISB Leadership Summit 2017 on Saturday.
“The script decides the success of a movie and not the presence of big stars,” he said in response to a question on whether Bollywood has finally moved on to subject-oriented movies. Karan also discussed the Bollywood studio system, which is “currently going through a dark phase”, while hoping for a revival. 
 While in Hyderabad, KJo couldn’t miss talking about his association with the two parts of SS Rajamouli’s magnum opus, Bahubali, which he presented in Hindi. “Baahubali was a game-changer. It was a crossover movie that crossed all linguistic boundaries.”

 Touching upon the craze of Bollywood movies among foreign audiences, he said, “My Name is Khan belonged to a niche genre of NRI movies that appealed to an overseas audience, beyond the Indian diaspora. The movie on the Muslim protagonist was a hit among the Arab audience.   was a success in China because it narrated a familiar plot that the Chinese could relate to,” he said.
