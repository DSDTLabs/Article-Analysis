Actress   says people were judgemental towards her regarding her weight post her pregnancy. 

 Recently,   Khan had said that some websites reported about her weight post pregnancy, which she didn't like. 
 
  
  
 When asked about the issue of body shaming, Shilpa, who welcomed son Viaan with husband   in 2012 said, "I can understand that emotion (of being judged), especially as an actress and someone who has been synonym with having a good body and (being into) fitness."
 
 "The pressure that I had when I had a baby, I didn't get out of my house for seven months. The pressure that nothing fit me. I remember the first time I got out of my house, five months after my delivery, my husband took me out for lunch. There were few ladies sitting, they laughed. I heard them, 'she hasn't still lost her weight'." 
 
 The 'Life in a Metro' star said the pressure to look good can be daunting and she lost nearly 32 kgs post that. 
 
 "So, it is very daunting. That's the day I decided 'oh my God, so people are judging me.' That's normal, because when you're an actor, you are going to be judged. That's part and parcel of being a celebrity." 
 
 Shilpa also shared an incident where she went to work after giving birth and the issue she faced. 
 
 "'Nach Baliye' was my first outing after pregnancy, eight months after I delivered. I was very scared. Clothes weren't fitting me, I was size 16, double the size I've ever been in my life."
 
 "When you're working, that gives you enough inspiration or goal. Some do it for their loved one, some for work, I think you've to do it for yourself."
