MUMBAI: A Mumbai man molested and then tried to strangle a woman he knows while they were both traveling on a local train in the city last night.

 A graphic video of the incident, which took place in the moving train's handicapped compartment, has since been widely viewed on social media.
 
 The couple were friends and had an altercation in a coach meant for handicap people of a CST-bound train between Kalyan and   between 11pm and 11.22 pm.
 
 Co-passengers alerted the Dadar police who then arrested the man and filed a case of attempt to commit murder and molestation against him.
 
 It's said the man, identified as one Rafique Khan, owed the woman a large amount of money. The duo got into a fight on the issue, following which the man molested and then tried to strangle the woman.
 
 Khan dragged the woman by the hair and tried to strangle her. Co-passengers, including a cop, raised an alarm but couldn't stop him due to a partition between the two compartments.
 
 Khan will be produced before a railway court on Friday.
