GHAZIABAD: The work for a three-lane   has started at the point where the   starts in   Extension even as the   is making last-minute preparations for the inauguration of 10.3-km long UP Gate to Raj Nagar Extension elevated road by January-end. 

 “Right at the planning stage, we had foreseen that Raj Nagar extension would be a point which would witness major traffic jams once elevated road becomes functional,” said SS  , superintending engineer, GDA. “So we had planned a rotary at this point which is very much part of elevated road and the work on this stretch is over,” said Verma.
 
 The three-lane rotary, which is elliptical in shape, is spread in an area of 13,000 sqm which includes the garden and landscaping area. Explaining the importance of the rotary, Verma said: “The place where the rotary is coming up is the meeting point for to and fro traffic from GT Road, Raj Nagar Extension and   bridge. The place is already congested and when the elevated road is opened, the point would have become a commute’s nightmare had we not planned the rotary.”
 
 Giving details of the traffic flow along the rotary, Verma said: “Vehicles coming from Raj Nagar extension will now move in a clockwise direction around rotary to GT Road, elevated road and Karhera bridge, ” said Verma. 
 
 “Likewise, the traffic bound for elevated road, GT road, and Raj Nagar extension from Karhera will have to circle rotary and same is the case with traffic coming from elevated road,” he added. 
 
 “This arrangement will ensure that the point is signal-free at all times and the traffic criss-crossing this point will move to the first destination without waiting, which will reduce chances of any major traffic jam once elevated road becomes functional,” said Verma.
