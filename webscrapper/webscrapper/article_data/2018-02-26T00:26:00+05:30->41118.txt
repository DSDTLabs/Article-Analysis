New Delhi: A day after a 46-year-old businessman allegedly committed suicide, a video has surfaced which was recorded by him on his phone moments before he pulled the trigger. Police are now probing the case based on this video.

 The phone was found in the car in which the victim, Raj Kumar Arora, killed himself on Saturday afternoon at Nirankari Colony ground in Timarpur.
 
 In the video clip, Arora, a property dealer, is seen putting a   on his temple wishing his family goodbye. He is heard telling his children to work hard and study well before telling his wife to take care of herself.
 
 When he pulls the trigger, an empty click is heard. The man then keeps the mobile phone down and is heard trying to fix the flaw. After fixing the pistol, he again focuses the   on his face and is heard laughing and saying, “Sorry Bhaio, goli chali nhi thi (Sorry people. The gun had misfired).”
 
 Arora, wearing a green T-shirt, then shares that he got the pistol from his cousin Monty, who he claims is a declared bad character. “I got this pistol from Monty, who slapped by brother and nobody could do anything to him,” Arora says in the video, before again pulling the trigger. But even now the gun doesn’t fire.
 
 He pulls out the magazine to check if it is faulty and again tries to shoot himself in the temple for the third time. Even this effort fails and the video abruptly ends there.
 
 Police officers said that the content of the video is being examined and the statements made by Arora are being investigated. The property dealer had suffered losses forcing him to sell his flat. He had been living at his brother’s place along with his wife.
