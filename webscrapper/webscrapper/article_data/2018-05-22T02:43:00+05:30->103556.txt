Guntur: Dalit Bahujan Research Centre (DBRC) has urged the state government to protect rag pickers who will ‘lose their livelihoods’ because of the upcoming waste-to-energy plants in the capital region.

 DBRC explained that   pickers must be encouraged to use scientific methods as it would be environmentally friendly and also sustain the economy which will not be the case with incineration plants.
 
 DBRC on Friday released a report on the living condition of waste pickers in the state. Citing the study, DBRC executive secretary Alladi Devakumar said most waste pickers are earning less than Rs 3,000 every month. He said the few who earn little more are also living in poverty due to their addiction to liquor.
 
 “More than 90 per cent of rag pickers do not possess social security cards. They are not drawing their ration or social welfare pension for elderly people,” said Devakumar. He said the waste-to-energy plant will take the jobs of 5,000 rag pickers. Since Guntur is on its way to becoming part of the capital region, which will be no less than a world class city, the local and state government should manage its waste properly and ensure that those dependent on the current set up don’t suffer, he suggested.
 
 The waste pickers should get proper safety equipment, good pay and a strong social, food and health safety net. “The money for installing the incineration plant can do a lot for Yanadis and further enhance the scale of recycling,” said Devakumar.
