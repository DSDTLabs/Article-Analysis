' ' director   says he still can't figure out why one of his films had flopped badly while another became a runaway success.

"We restricted ourselves to closer shots for 'Ahalya' for it has to be viewed on tab, mobile, laptops unlike big screen. Also for big screen sound has lot more variations and on phone you cut that off," he said. 
 
 Sujoy, who later told that 'Ahalya 2' storyboard is in progress and he will retain the same cast of  ,   and others. On the reason for putting short film online, he said, "When you are putting something online, it is being watched not only by Bengali audience but audiences from all over the world with sub-titles."
 
 "I am watching content on net which may or may not be in Bengali. I am watching the film and reading sub-titles. Many people across the globe are used to this kind of cinema. And if everyone could see Ray's films across world with subtitles, why not us?," Sujoy said. 
 
 In this context, he said 'he was not ok with dubbing'.
