NEW DELHI: The communication exchanged between   and his former female research analyst was not tampered with by any third party. Neither the complainant, who has accused Pachauri of sexually harassing her at  , interfered with the  ,  ,   messages sent by Pachauri nor any third person tampered with the “offending” correspondence sent by Pachauri.
 
  This has been concluded by the forensic sleuths who were entrusted with the task of probing as to whether the emails and messages sent by Pachauri to the 30-year-old woman were tampered with by her or any third party. A detailed report in this regard has been sent to the   by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Gandhinagar. The development assumes significance as this was the last leg of the forensic investigation which was awaited by the Delhi Police. It was the completion of forensic probe into this possibility which the Delhi Police was awaiting to submit the FSL report to the Delhi court which is adjudicating the sexual harassment case against Pachauri.
  
  ET was the first to report on November 2, 2016 that the FSL had submitted a confidential report to the Delhi police holding that Pachauri’s electronic devices were not hacked.
  
  Despite submission of this finding (by the FSL), the Delhi Police did not submit the report to the court as the report was “incomplete”. Police wanted to ascertain that even if Pachauri’s devices were found not be hacked, whether the communication between him and the complainant was tampered with or hacked by any third party or the complainant herself.
  
  Also, the police wanted to know from the forensic sleuths if the response(s) sent by the complainant to Pachauri were interfered with any mischievous person or party.
