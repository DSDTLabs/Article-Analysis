Ludhiana: Two months after nine firemen were killed in a cave-in after an LPG explosion at Amarson Polymers near Suffian Chowk, the families of six have now received compensation cheques for Rs 10 lakh each.

 The cheques were handed over to the family members of six firemen on Saturday while the family members of the rest of the three deceased will have to wait for at least a week before the department prepares their cheques.
 
 Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu and other Congress MLAs gave away the cheques at the MC office. Bittu also claimed inquiry of the incident was still underway and Patiala divisional commissioner P K Meena would submit his report on the basis of which future course of action will be decided on. 
 
 The compensation has been paid to six firemen Rajinder Sharma, Shimaun Gill, Rajkumar, Rajan, Puran Singh and Vishal Kumar. Manohar Lal, Manpreet Singh and Sukhdev have been recently declared dead by the district administration as their bodies were not traced from the debris of the building that had collapsed. Officials claimed they have already issued the death certificates to the family members of these three firemen and they will prepare the cheques as well in the next 10 days.
 
 Meanwhile MC Commissioner Jaskiran Singh said that they have initiated the process of giving job to kin of the deceased firemen and are awaiting approval from the state government. 
 
 Notably, it was on November 20, 2017 that fire broke in Amarson Polymers near Suffian Chowk. The building collapsed and 16 people died in the incident including 9 firemen. 
 
 Probe still on
 
 Even after two months after the tragedy, the probe is still continuing. The divisional commissioner Patiala VK Meena when contacted, said that it was not possible to comment since the probe was not over yet.
