 : Referring to the difficulty expressed by many SSC students who answered the science paper on Wednesday, chairman of   of secondary and higher secondary education Ramkrishna   said that the questions were not asked from out of syllabus.

 Samant told reporters at a press conference that, in accordance with the board’s practice, a scrutiny committee examined the question paper and in its report stated that it was balanced and prepared as per the pattern and prescribed curriculum.
 
 Samant ruled out the possibility of adopting a lenient approach in correcting the science paper.
 
 The board had informed schools about the pattern of the question paper in September, and a circular to the effect was uploaded on the board’s website, he said.
 
 Stating that the question paper was “very difficult, twisted and strange”, president Goa Headmasters’ Association Vithoba Dessai, in the memorandum submitted to Goa board, said, “Parents, teachers and all stakeholders have expressed grave concern over the sudden change of pattern and difficulty level of the science question paper.”
 
 The circular and model question bank uploaded on the board’s website was only a design of the question paper,   said. “It did not give comprehensive knowledge of change of pattern, rise of difficulty level, twisting of questions.”
