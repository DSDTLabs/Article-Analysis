GURUGRAM: The   of Sikanderpur Bada village has sought help from police after a statue of B R Ambedkar that they had set up on   was found broken and disfigured on Monday morning. 

 A group of 30 people had installed the small statue in Ambedkar Bhawan in preparation of Ambedkar Jayanti in April. 
 
 The Julaha community, who have historically worked as weavers, want the culprits who “dishonoured their messiah” to be caught. Village leaders told TOI that a plot in the village had been converted into a “chaupal” for the community in 2014 on which the Ambedkar Bhawan was later built. Villagers had recently pooled in money to install an   inside the boundary wall of the bhawan on Friday. But on Monday morning, Subedar Dharam Singh, a community member, found that the statue had been broken. Singh went to the village sarpanch and they decided to inform the cops.
 
 “We haven’t cooked in our homes. It feels like one of our elders have died,” said Subedar Singh. Cops from Sector 37 and Kherki Dhaula police station inspected the spot and an FIR was registered under Section 295 (Injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) of IPC. 
 
 Community members now intend to ask the deputy commissioner to reinstate the statue in the village. “We are poor people and the Constitution is our only hope,” said Singh.
 
 Dalit activists from the city visited the village and expressed solidarity with the villagers. “If the culprits are not caught within a week and the statue reinstated, we will be forced to protest on the streets,” said an activist. 
 
 The community members claimed that there had been no resistance to the setting up of the statue. “It is clearly an act by anti-social elements who want to disrupt peace,” said a villager.
