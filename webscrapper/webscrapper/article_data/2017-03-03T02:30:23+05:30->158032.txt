NEW DELHI: After a legal battle lasting over six years, New   (NDMC) has decided to auction   hotel. The decision was taken on Thursday in a meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. NDMC, which owns the public property, will e-auction the hotel at market rental value.

 The property was given to   (IHCL) on a lease for 33 years, which ended in 2011. The company was since given nine temporary extensions. After NDMC decided to auction the property, IHCL approached Delhi high court. The company’s plea was dismissed in October 2016 with the court allowing the civic body to auction the property.
 
 In November 2016, IHCL moved Supreme Court saying there was no need to auction the hotel as it was generating good revenue for the civic body.
 
 In January this year, SC directed NDMC to review its decision of auctioning the hotel as the opinions of the top two legal officers of the country — Attorney General and Solicitor General — were not considered by the council while taking a decision to auction the property. NDMC was given six weeks’ time to review its decision.
 
 “We prepared the proposal after consulting the council members and law officers. The same will be put up in SC. The final decision lies with SC, but we are certain that the decision will be in NDMC’s favour,” said a senior official.
 
 Meanwhile, NDMC will also be re-auctioning the Asian Hotel. The council had earlier put an end to legal tangles with the previous owner, who was evicted from the property on court orders. In January, the hotel was e-auctioned fetching Rs 45.5 lakh per month as licence fee, the highest ever for the agency.
 
 “But the bidder refused to take the hotel. The property will be auctioned again,” said an official.
