GHAZIABAD: A federation of apartment owners is planning to move Allahabad High Court seeking its intervention to stop commercial activity in   of Ghaziabad.

 Members of the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association alleged that though the   had identified over 16,000 such   across  , Vaishali and other areas in May last year, it hadn’t taken any action to remove them.
 
 Alok Kumar, the president of the federation, said the commercial establishments had cropped up in violation of a 2011 Supreme Court order, which barred any such activity in residential areas.
 
 “Moreover, such establishments jeopardise the safety and security of residents living in these societies. Allahabad High Court had in September 2013 directed the   to take action on commercial units operating from residential areas. We will have to move the high court again,” Kumar added.
 
 The federation said it had been pursuing the matter for the past five years. In several areas of Ghaziabad, banks, private schools and nursing homes are running from housing societies, which are not prescribed under the GDA bylaws. In a majority of the societies, the ground floors are being used for commercial purposes, causing traffic snarls in the area as people flocking to these shops park their vehicles along the road in the absence of a designated parking lot.
 
 The residents said traders preferred opening shops in housing societies as it cost them around four times lesser than in malls.
 
 District magistrate Ritu Maheshwari, who is also the vice-chairman of GDA, said: “Whenever we receive a complaint, the department looks into it and takes action. Moreover, the enforcement in-charge of each zone is responsible for taking action against such violations. In the past, many commercial establishments in residential areas had been closed down.”
