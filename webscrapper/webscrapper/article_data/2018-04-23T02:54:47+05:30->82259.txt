GURUGRAM: A man was   on Sunday for allegedly raping a 12-year-old girl in a slum in Sector 54. 

 He allegedly raped her in January and was attempting to commit the crime again on Saturday but was caught by neighbours.
 
 The accused has been identified as Anwar (21). According to cops, he is the cousin of the girl’s neighbour and is currently staying with them. 
 
 The minor’s parents are daily-wagers and do not stay at home during the day.
 
 He allegedly raped her when she had dropped by at the neighbour’s house for a visit in January. Afterwards, he went back to his hometown in   for three months and returned to Gurugram recently. 
 
 On Saturday, he came to the girl’s house and allegedly tried to rape her again. The girl’s neighbours caught him in the act and informed her parents.
 
 “She was raped in January, and they found that he was attempting to rape her again,” said inspector  , SHO of Women’s police station. The girl had kept mum earlier but revealed the January incident to her parents when neighbours informed them, she added. The parents then took her to cops.
 
 The girl’s statement was recorded in front of a magistrate, after which an FIR was registered against Anwar under relevant sections of the POCSO Act at Women’s police station on Saturday. He was arrested on Sunday. “We have arrested the accused after receiving the girl’s complaint. He is yet to be produced in court,” Hudda said.
