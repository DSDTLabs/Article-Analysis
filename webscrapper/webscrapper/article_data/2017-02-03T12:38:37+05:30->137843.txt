 Just Like Thani Oruvan, Bogan is a celebration of the antagonist, and once again, Arvind Swami rocks in the role of a charismatic villain. This is a much looser performance than the one he gave in Thani Oruvan. Earlier, you could sense the actor holding back but now, he seems more relaxed and comfortable and is performing these roles with relish. This is also why Ravi’s performance feels underwhelming. The actor feels miscast in a role that needs someone who can chew scenery. But he is like a tightly wound spring (this worked wonderfully in Thani Oruvan), so we never get the over-the-top villainy that he character deserves in the second half, which doesn’t generate the sparks that we expect after the excellent interval block.
