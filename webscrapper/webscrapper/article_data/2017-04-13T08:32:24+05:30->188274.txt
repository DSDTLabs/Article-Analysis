NEW DELHI: A   politician from Burari, Harish Nainwal, was   to death by a   on Wednesday morning.

 The incident once again showed how badly the civic body has failed to control stray cattle menace in the city. Nainwal had been BJP’s mandal adhyaksh and Burari mahamantri. He was out to fetch milk when the incident occurred.
 
 “He was walking alone when the bull struck him from behind. By the time others realised what had happened, he had already expired” said Rajpal Rana, the local area councillor from Jharoda.
 
 “I have been told that the same bull hit three people earlier but since no complaint was made, the bull was not captured.” Rana added.
