GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Congress president   said that Ahmed Patel would win his   easily, despite BJP fielding former Congress chief whip Balwantsinh Rajput as their third candidate, for the seat technically available to the Congress from the proportion of their MLAs.

 Solanki said, “Ahmed Patel and Amit   will win the elections easily, while the competition will be between Smriti Irani and Balwantsinh Rajput only.”
 
 Solanki said, “The BJP has done horse-trading with our MLAs and is still trying to poach more MLAs. However, our MLAs are committed and despite crores of rupees being offered and threats to their families, they have respected the mandate of people and are committed to the Congress.”
 
 We challenge BJP to call for early elections: Solanki
 
 Instead of trying to buy Congress MLAs against the people’s mandate, the BJP must call early elections instead of calling a one-day assembly session. I challenge the BJP to call for early elections instead of trying to bribe Congress MLAs.”
 
 PM gives thousands of crores to other countries, why only Rs 500 crore for Banaskantha: Solanki
 
 PM Narendra Modi, who announces Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore assistance to Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries has made only a token Rs 500 crore announcement for flood-ravaged north Gujarat. 
 
 PM Modi sought publicity, Manmohan Singh also allotted Rs 500 crore: Modhwadia
 
 Former Gujarat Congress president Arjun Modhwadia said, “PM Modi, for his political reasons alone, announced Rs 500 crore assistance for flood victims, which is nothing compared to the scale of the damage. Former PM Manmohan Singh several years ago when the same area saw floods, had provided Rs 500 crore assistance without seeking any publicity.
