BENGALURU: The   (CCB) has found that the three Pakistanis arrested last week along with an Indian for illegally staying in the city purchased   cards for just Rs 300 from a middleman in Banashankari, south Bengaluru. Kirhon Ghulam Ali, 26,  , 30 and  , 25, natives of Karachi, and  , an Indian from Kerala, are now in police custody. Shihab is married to Samira and Khasif is married to Kirhon.

 All four were arrested from a house in Kumaraswamy Layout, south Bengaluru on Thursday. Police have launched a manhunt for the person or persons who helped the trio get Aadhaar cards.
 
 Sources said the cards were issued to the three Pakistanis in January this year. The trio told investigating officers that after settling down in their Kumaraswamy Layout residence, they were trying to get local identity cards like ration card and voter ID card. “Muhammad Shihab said they approched a middleman to get an Aadhaar card, so that getting other cards like voter ID card and ration card would be easier,“ they said. 
 
 Kirhon and Khasif approached a local who promised them Aadhaar card without any supporting documents. “First, he demanded Rs 500 per card and we told him we are very poor and couldn't cannot shell out Rs 500 per card. After much bargaining, the deal was finalized at Rs 100 per card,“ Kirhon and Khasif Shamshuddin told investigating officials. “Locals helped them get Aadhaar card without any documents,“ sources said.
 
 
 
 
 Bengaluru police have written a four-page letter to the Pakistani embassy in Delhi, explaining the arrest of three Pakistanis staying illegally in the city. “We have asked them to confirm the residential address and names of Kirhon, Khasif and Samira who stayed in Karachi,“ a senior police officer said.
