JALANDHAR: Claiming the government has destroyed the drug supply chain in 47 days, state health minister   on Sunday informed that the health department would now concentrate on spiritual development of the addicts who needed rehabilitation. 

 Attending a function organized by  , an affiliate of Divya Jyoti Jagriti   Nurmahal, Mohindra said that addicts needed spiritual treatment to develop tenacity for de-addiction. He added the government would seek support from religious and social institutions and a high level meeting would be called soon. According to him, plans are afoot to strengthen the ayurvedic wing of the health department and set up drug-de-addiction centres at district level. These centers would be operational in the next two months.
 
 The minister's statement comes in the wake of opposition parties coming down heavily on chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who vowed to end the drug menace in a month after coming to power. They allege that despite the promise, no big drug lord has been arrested yet. The state government on the contrary, has cited examples of arrest of drug peddlers to justify its success in breaking the supply chains. 
 
 Mohinder later visited the headquarters of the Sansthaan at Nurmahal where the body of its founder   has been kept in a freezer. The Sansthaan refuses to cremate him claiming he was in Samadhi and would return to life.
