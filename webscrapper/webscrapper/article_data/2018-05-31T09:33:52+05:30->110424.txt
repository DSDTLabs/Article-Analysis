SHIMLA: As the   deepens in Shimla, local residents in the hill state have started posting keep-off-Shimla messages for tourists on social media. "There is no water for us, please do not come here and select some other destination," one of them said. 

 
 The population of   area is about 1.72 lakh but it swells by between 90,000 and one lakh during the peak tourist season in summer. The requirement of water increases to 45 million litres a day. "The government should issue an advisory to tourists asking them not to come to Shimla till the situation improves as it would cause further inconvenience to water-starved residents," 78-year old Bharaiv Dutt wrote in his post. The   have alarmed hoteliers. But some of them are so fed up with complaints from the customers that they have offered full refund of the advance payment if they choose to cancel.
 
  
  
 
 Some posts cautioned tourists, claiming that restaurants and dhabas were using the water from the city drains for cooking. 
 
 Meanwhile, the HC has directed the Shimla Municipal Corporation to immediately disconnect water supply to hotels that have not cleared municipal dues. There are 224 such hotels.
