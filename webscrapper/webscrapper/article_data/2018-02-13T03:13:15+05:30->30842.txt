NEW DELHI: The   of   between   and   and the   (EPE) is set to   in  . Haryana government claimed on Monday that the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE), the other half of the ring bypass for Delhi will be operational by the end of next month.

 Highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday that his ministry has sought time from the prime minister’s office for inaugurating the first two projects. While the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is building these roads, the Haryana government is constructing the WPE. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who visited a construction site, has said PM will inaugurate the expressway.
 
 NHAI officials said they will complete the ongoing bridges on the Yamuna and near Ganesh Nagar in the next 20 days. Though the completion of this first stretch (8.7 km) of the much delayed Delhi-Meerut Expressway will bring relief to people, commuters travelling beyond Ghaziabad border will have to wait at least one more year to enjoy the ride. 
 
 The entire stretch up to Dasna on NH-24 will be widened to 14 lanes, which will have barricaded six lanes at the centre, for long distance traffic. NHAI has bid out the Meerut Expressway projects in for tranches. Though the official deadline for the first stretch is two-and-a-half years, it’s getting completed in 15 months. So far as EPE is concerned, the road will be completed in two-and-half years.
