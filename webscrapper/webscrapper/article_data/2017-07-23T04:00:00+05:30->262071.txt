Ahmedabad: Am earth-mover carrying garbage to the Pirana dump, the 55-metre mound of waste, was almost buried by a waste-slide from the top of the mound, which left the driver unable to move the machine. The driver placed an SOS call and was subsequently pulled out from the garbage. 

 Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) officials said the driver was rescued and the vehicle retrieved on Saturday morning. 
 
 AFES teams were sent to Dhandhuka and Bagodara in Ahmedabad district on Saturday to conduct rescue operations in flooded areas. While 13 persons were rescued from Dhariya village near Dhandhuka and shifted to the nearby Khasta village, another team started rescue operations near Bagodara late on Saturday. 
 
 M F Dastoor, chief fire officer, AFES, said that two teams of eight firemen with two boats were sent to parts of the district for rescue operations. “While there were calls for waterlogging in Ahmedabad city, there were no major rescue calls,” he said.
 
 On Friday and Saturday, AFES recorded 17 calls for tree falls, 3 of wall collapses, two for structural collapses and four for short-circuits caused by the rain. A part of a residence in Raikhad collapsed at 10.30am, said officials, adding that nobody was injured.
