NASHIK: The   (RFSL) has got a shot in the arm on Thursday with the opening of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) division. 

 The new facility was inaugurated by   commissioner Ravinder Singal,w ho said this is a major achievement for the staff of RFSL and a big help for the police.
 
 "The new division will help speedier collection of DNA samples, processing them and getting the reports faster, reducing the average time of more than six months," he said. 
 
 A lot of convictions depend on scientific analysis and there is heavy demand by defendants in the court about such test reports to prove the charges levelled by the prosecution.
 
 "The new facility will help in reducing the investigation time. It will also benefit our employees and officers as they will be sent here for training or for refreshing training in terms of sample collection and other measures," Singal said. The  , raised at a cost of around Rs 5 crore, is the fourth in the state after Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune and the fifth one will be set up in Aurangabad.
 
 The RFSL here, managed by the state government, has five divisions dealing with various activities and the DNA division was the sixth. It will start receiving samples from August 1.
 
 "We are proud of the Nashik team that has zero pendency. Mumbai and others, which are short-staffed, are struggling to achieve it," said RFSL director Krishna Kulkarni.
 
 In 10% of the total cases, which include sexual assaults and identification of unknown bodies, DNA tests are necessary for an accurate decision.
 
 "There is a waiting list of about 2,000 cases each in the Mumbai, Pune laboratories that will require over a year to get fresh sample tested. The DNA division will help police from Jalgaon, Nandurbar, Dhule and Nashik save time. It will attract cases from Mumbai and Pune laborotaries," said SA Shinde, deputy director of Nashik RFSL.
