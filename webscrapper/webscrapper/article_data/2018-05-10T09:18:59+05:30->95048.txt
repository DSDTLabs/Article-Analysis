CHANDIGARH: Former minister and vice-president of   Aftab Ahmed on Wednesday accused chief minister   of creating controversies around Muslim festivals.

 Interacting with newspersons here on Wednesday, Aftab said unavailability of adequate space with the   has forced people to offer namaz on roadsides.
 
 “Offering namaz has been the practice for decades now. We wonder as to how it has started to affect people. For us, it is just a political gimmick. As far as the CM is concerned, he first creates a controversy, then retracts from his words,” alleged Aftab.
 
 He alleged that earlier too, the BJP government in Haryana created the beef biryani controversy and then retracted from its stand. “This shows either he lacks experience or is interested in creating controversies,” Aftab said.
