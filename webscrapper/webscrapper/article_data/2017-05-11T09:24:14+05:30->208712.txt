Even as  , popularly known as Ramya, has been appointed as the new chief of the All India   Committee's social media wing, the former   MP was rather quiet on social media for the past two days. Despite most official social media accounts of various Congress wings congratulating her and wishing her well in the new assignment,  's did not respond on her official social media accounts.

 Ramya took over as incharge of the   social media wing from Rohtak MP Deependra Hooda on May 9. Known for her sharp online rhetoric and ability to connect with the youth, Ramya's appointment comes in the run-up to   going to polls in 2018.
 
 With H D Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) launch ing his own revived on line platforms and   state in-charge Muralidhar Rao suggesting social media will drive the saffron party's campaign, Ramya's appointment at the national level may give direction to the   in the IT-BT capital of the country.
 
 It may be recalled that Ramya became the focal point of an Indo-Pak fight last year for her post of “Pakistan is not hell“ and cases being filed against her for this statement being “seditious“ in nature.
