CHENNAI: After a lull of over 15 years since the project was proposed,   ( ) has decided to undertake the construction of a flyover connecting   and Integral Coach Factory ( ) Road. 

 The 58.5crore flyover will be built to close the level crossing 1 (LC1) between the Villivakkam and Perambur Loco Works Railway Stations, in an area connecting key locations such as Anna Nagar, Kolathur, Korattur, GKM Colony, Periyar Nagar, Perambur and ICF. The LC1 is shut every fifteen minutes causing problems to commuters. 
 
 "As the gate remains shut for nearly half an hour, it takes more time for all the vehicles to pass after the gate is opened," said Sriram, a resident of Villivakkam.
 
 In a statement, the GCC said it has written to the   with the detailed estimate, as it was proposed in 2003 that the project be undertaken by the local body and the railways by splitting the cost 50-50. In 2005-2006, the railways had included the project in its pink book.
 
 A study of the vehicle census at LC1 showed the 10,00,000 Train Vehicle Units (TVUs) crossing the level each day. 'The crossing would need a flyover that could handle an average annual traffic flow of 19,000 Passenger Car Unit (PCU),' the study noted.
 
 The cost of the project would also cover the costs involved in acquiring land from ICF and a few private parties. 
 
 The corporation is awaiting a response from the railway after which a draft detailed project report will be prepared.
 
  The bids will be raised after that and work would thus commence, the statement said.
