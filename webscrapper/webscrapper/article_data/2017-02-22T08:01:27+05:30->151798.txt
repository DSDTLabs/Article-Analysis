BENGALURU:   for 2016-17 stood at Rs 5,032 crore, but for   it meant nothing. The flower vendor had to take his 20-yearold dead daughter home on his moped after calls for an ambulance had no response. The nearest primary health centre he rushed to had no doctors.

 Karnataka's track record of universal health access is absymal. The state spends the least on   in south India as per the Union health ministry's assessment for the year 2015-16. Karnataka's per capita public health expenditure is Rs 731 compared to Kerala (Rs 1,057), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 733) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 839).
 
 Health minister Ramesh Kumar, however, was on the defensive on Tuesday. “Why are government hospitals always criticized? Unlike private hospitals, we don't drill holes in citizens' pockets,“ he told TOI. His defence of government hospitals makes no sense to   who lost his young daughter.
 
 Public health exper ts blame the state government's skewed priorities for the poor scene of health infrastructure in rural Karnataka. Contrary to the government's perception, private hospitals today offer a lot of subsidies to the poor. “The government has a wrong impression that private hospitals only fleece patients.Instead of constantly targeting private hospitals, the health minister and his department must set right the anomalies in government hospitals since health is a state subject,“ they said.
 
 The Karnataka government, had in 2016 budget, announced `mobile health and mobike clinic services' to provide mobile health services to hospitals without transport facilities. The scheme also includes sending mobike clinics (clinic on two wheelers) to villages where ambulances cannot go.
 
 “The scheme is being implemented . We h ave equipped ambulances to help them reach remote areas too,“ said the health minister on Tuesday .
