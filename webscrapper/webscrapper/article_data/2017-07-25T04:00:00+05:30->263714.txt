Surat: Police in Navsari district are yet to reach any conclusion in the investigation into the death of Hitesh Desai (37), a city-based realtor and stud farm owner, whose body was found in his farmhouse at Navsari on June 23. 

 Desai was reportedly leading a socially disturbed life for the past few months. Hence, he shot himself on the head with his licensed gun when he was alone at his farmhouse. 
 
 He was with a married female friend in the city the whole day and took the extreme step upon reaching his farmhouse at night. Desai’s wife was not living with him for the past months. He made calls to his parents and reportedly talked emotionally disturbing things with them, sources said, adding that they did not suspect he would do anything like this. The police stated that the family members reached the farmhouse only in the morning when a domestic help alerted them. 
 
 Meanwhile, the police are yet to register the statement of Desai’s female friend with whom he had gone for shopping and dinner the day before his death. The female friend had approached court for anticipatory bail but her application was rejected. The woman has disappeared and was not cooperating with police in the investigation. The statements of Desai’s family members were registered 10 days after his death. 
 
 The police could recover only one out of three phones that Desai used to keep. It was unlocked by forensic science laboratory (FSL) experts in Surat. The FSL officials said they are dependent on the police to get them the passwords to unlock the phones. 
 
 “We are yet to get any success in our investigations into the circumstances that led to the death of Hitesh Desai. The investigations are continuing. Police are yet to register the statement of the deceased’s female friend,” said M S Bharada, superintendent of police, Navsari.
