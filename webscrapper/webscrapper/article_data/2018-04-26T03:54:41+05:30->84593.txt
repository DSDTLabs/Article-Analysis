GURUGRAM: MCG carried out yet another   in the restricted zone around the   (IAF) ammunition depot on Wednesday, in which officials sealed three newly constructed buildings and demolished an under-construction building.

 According to MCG officials, the drive was carried out as per the orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court. 
 
 “Demolitions will continue as per our schedule. We are, again, urging the people to not carry out any new construction within the 900m around the ammunition depot,” said an MCG official from the enforcement team. 
 
 In order to avoid any untoward incident, cops were also present with the MCG officials. 
 
 Last week, a similar drive near   had turned ugly when villagers pelted stones on a team of MCG officials who had gone there for a demolition drive. Between March and April, MCG sealed or demolished around 50 properties in the restricted zone.
 
 In another demolition drive, MCG razed 50 shanties which had encroached upon government land in Sector 40. A team of MCG officials also removed several temporary shops and other structures erected illegally in Golf Course road in a third drive on Wednesday. “This is a part of a series of anti-encroachment drives planned to free government land from encroachments. We have also constituted different teams in every zone to list out encroachments on government land and act against them,” said another MCG official.
 
 These teams will function under junior engineers to identify encroachments in their areas and remove them. MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav has also directed senior officials to draw up a list of encroached properties in every ward. 
 
 The corporation is also planning to draw up a list of its total land bank and plots being encroached.
