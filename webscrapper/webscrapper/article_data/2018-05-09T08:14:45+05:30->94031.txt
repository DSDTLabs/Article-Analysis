CHENNAI: Public funds will no longer be used for maintaining animals   from trafficking and abuse as the onus has been fixed on the accused till the   verdict is out, says the   (AWBI).

 Nearly 4,000 to 7,000 animals are rescued from abuse every year in India and more than 10,000 people are convicted in connection with such cases, according to official data.
 
 As soon as a case is booked by the local police, the rescued animals are sent to the nearest animal care centre with a shelter home, run by   recognised by AWBI, a statutory body functioning under the Union environment ministry. 
 
 On an average, it takes four to six months for the court to pronounce the verdict on these cases, but till then the NGOs, funded by AWBI, spend money from their own pockets to feed the animals and provide necessary medication and other related expenses, said S K Mittal, an AWBI member. Though the court orders the convicted persons to reimburse the cost, the NGOs do not get back the entire amount they had spent because there is no standard rule on rates to be provided for animal care in these circumstances. 
 
 In a recent meeting, the AWBI had revised the rules. Accordingly, the accused should take care of the entire expenses until the case is disposed of.
 
 A total of Rs150 to Rs 300 has been fixed as maintenance cost per day, and animals’ ownership would be transferred if they failed to pay this amount on time, Mittal said. “As far as TN is concerned, there is rampant trafficking of cattle to the neighbouring state of Kerala through Palakkad check post. Soon, we will be working along with local enforcement authorities to ensure that cases are booked not only under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act but also under Motor Vehicles Act, IPC and Wildlife Protection Act. By this, we believe that illegal animal trafficking can be brought under control,” he added.
