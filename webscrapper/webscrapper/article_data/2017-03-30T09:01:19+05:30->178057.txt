JODHPUR: The investigation into the alleged setting a woman on fire by sarpanch and others in Hariyadhana village on Saturday has not yet produced any evidence in corroboration of the allegation.

 The police and the administration, which have been camping in the village for the past two days, recreated the scene of incident at the same spot and also spoke to villagers, but all of them have indicated that the woman immolated herself.
 
 “There was no evidence so far which could prove that   was set ablaze by the sarpanch and other villagers in the presence of so many persons as has been alleged by her brother  ,” said SP (Jodhpur Rural)  .
 
 Meanwhile, the village Patwari, who was one of the accused and had been absconding like all the accused till now, appeared before the police on Wednesday and recorded his statements.
 
 “He also denied the allegation and claimed that Lalita emerged from nowhere with a bottle in her hand, poured the liquid on herself and set herself ablaze,” Kumar said.
 
 While the patwari appeared before the police, remaining nine accused continue to abscond and police have been appealing them to appear before her for their statements.
 
 Kumar said that the police have been investigating the matter with all seriousness and even if someone is guilty of doing this or leading Lalita to such step, would not be let off.
 
 “We are also trying to find out that if she immolated herself, why she did so because the road in question, which was being widened, had been measured by the village administration on March 17 and there was no objection was reported from any of the villagers or even the family of Lalita,” Kumar said.
 
 On the other hand, a team of   (NCW) also reached Jodhpur and gathered the details of the case from the police and the administration.
