When a filmmaker like Majid   chooses an actor as the centrepiece of his narrative, he’ll ensures it all looks authentic. That’s exactly what   experienced while working on his debut, ' ', directed by the Iranian legend. The film, set against the backdrop of Mumbai, revolves around the trials and tribulations faced by a brother-sister duo, played by Ishaan and Malavika Mohanan. 

 Ishaan, who plays Amir, had a couple of chase sequences in which he’s seen running for his life. To capture the spirit of survival and urgency, Majidi made Ishaan run through the narrow bylanes of Dharavi, Kabutar Khana, Chor Bazaar and Versova Village among other places. The director believes that all his actors should stay honest to every emotion while performing 
 their scenes. 
 
 For the chase sequence, for instance, he asked Ishaan to actually run as fast as he could, as if his life depended on it. Majidi would drive him to give his best to every shot and the actor didn’t quite disappoint the legendary filmmaker.
