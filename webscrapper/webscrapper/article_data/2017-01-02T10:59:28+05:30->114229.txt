GUWAHATI: Despite reeling under the blockade on two highways, preparations for assembly election have started in  .
 
  While the Congress has started the process of ticket distribution as ticket seekers start making rounds of party office in Imphal, Prime Minister   is likely to visit the state shortly to kick start the BJP’s poll campaign.   is likely to lay the foundation stone for National Sports University at Koutruk in Imphal West and also inaugurate Mary Kom’s Boxing Academy at Langol Games Village, Imphal West.
  
  A senior   leader told ET, “Modi is likely to have discussions with state leadership on poll preparedness. He will be accompanied by Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (independent charge) Vijay Goel.”
  
  Congress-led Manipur had acquired 390 acres at 41 Yaithibi Loukon earlier for setting up of the university. But, sports minister Vijay Goel during his last visit had said that the land was a low lying area and decided to shift the university site to Koutruk. The Congress has announced the constitution of Congress Election Campaign Committee with the chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh as its chairman.
  
  State Chief O Minister Ibobi Singh asked ticket aspirants not to be disappointed if some of them are not given the ticket and continue to be loyal party men. “We in the Congress party are not power mongers. If I have to die, I will die as a Congressman” Singh said. Deputy Chief Minister Gaikhangam said that by demonetisation, BJP has dug its own grave.
  
  The political atmosphere in Manipur is already surcharged with United Naga Council clamping blockade since November 1 last year and violence in the valley.
