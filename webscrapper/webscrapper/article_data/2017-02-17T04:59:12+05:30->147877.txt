MUMBAI: BEST general manager   on Thursday said there will be `zero tolerance' for bus mishaps--which have gone up to 16 in the past 11 months.

 “We are   on safe driving and also trying to implement certain measures to prevent accidents,“ he said. Apart from mishaps in which pedestrians and bikers were killed, the red buses also witnessed two fires in the past fortnight.
 
 “While in the first case, we came across a CNG leak which caused the blaze that charred our bus, the second fire is still being probed,“ Patil said after the committee meeting on Thursday . Sources told TOI the second fire allegedly occurred due to a short circuit in wires near the engine.
 
 Patil has directed his staff to conduct a thorough inspection of the nearly 2,000 CNG buses in the fleet at 26 depots across Mumbai.“I want to ensure buses are properly maintained and in spected before they leave the depot. We do not want a repeat of such fires,“ he stated.
 
 As for road accidents, it was observed that in most mishaps the victim was hit by the left rear side of the BEST bus.
 
 “As a road safety measure, we have decided to double the size (lengthwise) of the rear-view mirror for drivers so they can get a broader view of oncoming vehicles and the road, and prevent mishaps. This is because 60% of fatal road accidents involving BEST is due to cyclists, bikers and pedestrians being hit by the rear left side of the bus,“ Patil said.
 
 Said BEST committee member Shivji Singh: “We need to guarantee safety of our passengers--be it mishaps or fires. If such incidents keep recurring, we will lose more passengers.Our commuter strength has dipped from 43 lakh seven years ago to less than 30 lakh and we cannot afford to lose more commuters.“
 
 He informed the panel that there was an urgent need to appoint experienced staffers for maintenance of the buses and it was also essential to replace buses more than 10 years old.
