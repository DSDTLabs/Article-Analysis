TRICHY: Jaw-dropping feats were achieved in the shot put event by  , of class 8 from a government school in  , who threw a shot (4kg) 8.64m and R Amsaveni, of class 6 from Pudukkottai, who threw the shot (3kg) 7.24m at two-day   held at the Anna stadium in Trichy on Sunday.

 “Achieving such distance is indeed a remarkable feat for students in their middle school, that too without any formal training,” said P Velmurugan, manager,   of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) Sports Hostel, Trichy. 
 
 Close to 1,000 students from government middle schools across four district including Trichy were handpicked after preliminary training in various athletic events. They were made to perform in the two-day sporting event organised under the state government’s World Beaters Talent Spotting scheme. Among them, 360 budding athletes were identified and rewarded with Rs 6,000 each based on their performance. “If they could perform so well with mere 10 per cent of the required training, they will be capable of doing wonders,” said Velmurugan.
