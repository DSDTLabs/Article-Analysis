NAVI MUMBAI: The shopping markets across the city are thronged with people as the holy month of   begins from May 28. The community will observe fast and prayers for a month. During this time, food and water is consumed only before and after sunset.

 As food is consumed at odd hours, they prefer eating light but substantial food. 
 
 Fruits, seviyaan, light snacks and dry fruits, especially dates are eaten in plenty. And although fasting and prayer remains the focus during the holy month, being charitable is also an important aspect of the community during this month.
 
 ‘‘During this time, fruit prices rise by 10% to 15%. Watermelons, papayas, chickoos and mangoes are the most popular. Customers look for quantity since people tend to eat in groups once the fast is broken,’’ said Hukum Sinha, a fruit seller. 
 
 Dates are eaten the most during this time, and most of it comes from the Middle East. The prices of dates start from Rs 150 a kg and can go up to over Rs 1,000 depending on the quality.
 
 ‘‘Since they eat fresh fruit and light meals, dates are just one aspect,’’ said Nikam Gupta, a seller. The rising temperatures is also playing spoil sport as people tend to eat less due to the heat. Also, some find it difficult to sustain throughout the day without water as it is extremely hot. ‘‘The heat makes is difficult, but it is best not to think about it. Not eating throughout the day is mamageable, especially for those who have been doing it over the years,’’ said Sakina Mukadam, a Vashi resident.
