THANE: The six families residing in   hutments which were destroyed because of heavy rain and strong winds on Saturday night were evacuated from the dangerous area on Sunday morning.

 At around 8pm on Saturday, the walls of the three of the illegally constructed hutments atop the Gholai mandir hill in   came crashing down on the settlements that were built at a lower level of the same hill.
 
 Nobody was at home in each of these settlements and thus were left unscathed, the huts themselves were completely destroyed.
 
 While some of the members of these six families picked up whatever belongings they could find and moved away immediately, a few had to be asked to leave by the civic officials on Sunday morning.
 
 “The houses were built at the bottom of the hill and were not made with the strongest of material. The heavy rain showers came rushing down the slope of the hill and coupled with the force of the wind, caused the hutments along the way to go crashing on the ones below. The families of the completely destroyed huts left the area at night itself, while the others left on Sunday morning after we explained the dangers of living in the area to them,” said Madan Sonde, assistant commissioner at the Kalwa Ward office.
 
 “Our team cleared away a lot of the rubble just after the incident took place to ensure that no one was left hurt underneath it. the rest was cleared in the morning,” he added.
