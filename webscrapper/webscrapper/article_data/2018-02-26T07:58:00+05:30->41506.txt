Shimla: CBI investigation in Kotkhai custodial death case has come under scanner with one of the arrested accused demanding a fresh investigation through National Investigative Agency (NIA) or CID to bring out the truth. Head Constable Mohan Lal, who is currently lodged in Kanda Jail, Shimla, has sent a letter to the Himachal Pradesh high court in Shimla, the governor, the chief minister and the DGP.

 While the authenticity of this letter is yet to be verified, Congress has already started attacking CBI for its failure to arrest the real accused involved in the gangrape and murder of a minor girl from Kotkhai in July last year.
 
 Suraj Singh, who was arrested by Kotkhai police in connection with gangrape and murder of a minor girl, was killed inside the police lock up at Kotkhai on July 18 last year. While probing the custodial death case, CBI had arrested nine police officials, including IGP Zahur H Zaidi and then Shimla SP D W Negi.
 
 Mohan Lal was among the arrested cops but has now raised question on the CBI probe. In the letter, he has narrated the entire incident leading to the death of Suraj Singh inside the police lock up. He claimed that before his arrest, he had revealed everything to CBI team but his statement was not considered. He has alleged that CBI has not brought out the truth in custodial death case so fresh probe should be conducted through some other investigation agency. He said that instead of innocent people, the real accused should be punished.
 
 Reacting to the letter, Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee media cell chairman Naresh Chauhan said that even after eight months of probe, CBI was empty handed in the gangrape and murder case. He said that following the surfacing of the letter, now state government should order probe through some other agency as CBI has failed to arrest the real accused. He said that now need is also being felt for judicial probe to look into the entire incident.
