LUCKNOW: Expecting a deluge of complaints related to violation of the   over   during UP elections, police are busy charting out its strategy these days. In the run-up to the polls, political parties are campaigning over social media as well so the police department has decided to create a hashtag specifically for  .

 However, before it does that, the department would invite suggestions from Twitter users to finalise the hashtag. It has prepared a list of hashtags with different key words and will put it up for selection on its social media platforms.
 
 “We have shortlisted five to six hashtags for code violation complaints. The most popular one would be announced this Monday,” said DGP Javeed Ahmad. Head of Twitter Seva, Raheel Khursheed, is also mulling over different options.
 
 Party workers or individuals have already started clicking photographs of violations and sharing them with the department. “Traction on Twitter is high. Between January 10 and 17, we received 110 complaints pertaining to model code of conduct violation,” said Addl SP Rahul Srivastava, public relation officer of the department, who supervises social media initiatives.
 
 As the handle of UP police is flooded with general complaints, a separate hashtag, such as #Election17UPPolice, will make it easier for the men in uniform to identify poll violation grievances in one go. While pointing out violations, Twitter users will be urged to share timing and location where the alleged offence took place.
 
 Ahmad said a flying squad at the location would be asked to verify the complaint. “Generally, a lot of false alarms are sounded out around the polling day. We will identify those users and will book them accordingly,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, not everyone is upbeat about the decision. “Some parties indulge in rumour-mongering to settle scores with their opponents. This practice needs to be checked too,” said Piyush Mishra, in-charge of social media cell of a political party’s UP wing.
