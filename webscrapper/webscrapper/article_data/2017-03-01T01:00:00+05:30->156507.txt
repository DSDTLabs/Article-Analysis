Eight years after '  Raj', Amitabh Bachchan is all set to return to theatres as  , a Godfather-like patriarch of Mumbai. And this time around, we hear, his trademark intimidating stares, scary scowls and highly memorable one-liners are even more fierce. 

 With the trailer of Ram Gopal Varma’s 'Sarkar 3' releasing today, fans of the franchise will get a dekko of one of Big B’s most iconic characters. The filmmaker says, “I believe that Amitabh Bachchan is the only actor, who possesses the power to make a character like Sarkar come alive. I can imagine 'Godfather' without Brando ( , the Hollywood actor who played the title role), but not 'Sarkar' franchise without AB. His trademark anger has been missing in all his films in the last decade, so I decided to bring it back in this film by making his character angrier than ever.” Apart from Bachchan Sr, the film also stars Manoj Bajpayee, Ronit Roy, Amit Sadh,  ,   and Rohini Hattangadi among others. 
 
 'Sarkar 3', presented by Eros International and produced by Alumbra Entertainment, Wave Cinemas & AB Corp, releases April 7.
