Panaji: Highlighting what he termed as “judicial interference” Rajya Sabha member of Parliament  , on Wednesday, said that the judiciary could not interfere in matters allotted to the legislature and executive. Naik was hitting out at the Supreme Court (SC) based on the decisions taken on office bearers of the Board of the Control of Cricket in India, weight of school bags, how droughts should be managed and budgeting for disaster response.

 Arguing that lapses on the part of lawmakers was not valid ground for judges to take policy decision, Naik has sought a special session of parliament to discuss increasing judicial activism.
 
 The Congress MP appears upset with the December 15, 2016, SC order that specifies the distance of a liquor outlet from national and state highways. “The Supreme Court has also modified their order, and further, has given exemptions for certain north eastern areas, which is prima facie the job of the legislature and executive,” Naik said.
 
 Naik has written to Rajya Sabha leader Arun Jaitley and Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, seeking a special session of Parliament “to discuss the increasing judicial activism”.
