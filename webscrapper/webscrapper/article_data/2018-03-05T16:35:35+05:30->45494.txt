"My mom telling me to wear skirts out less often. Nirbhaya and more, left forgotten. We don’t want to be another of India’s daughters, do we? So I wear my jeans long, and wear my tops high. Don’t show my cleavage or a hint of my thighs. Don’t want to be mistaken for wanting it...,” this is how Aranya Johar starts her 2017 poem (and now a viral hit) “A Brown Girl’s Guide to Gender”. Spoken word poetry has become one of the most popular platforms for women to come and er…speak out – most under 25 years.

 At 23, poet   feels like a veteran already. Kaur says that the platform helps women tell their stories. “It’s great to see that a medium considered rather ‘girlie’ has been weaponised by women,” she says. 
 
 
 Delhi-based slam poet  , 21, feels that spoken word poetry can go a long way in building a culture of resistance, through social media campaigns, poetry events, and customised events. Bijlani has performed pieces on high functioning depression, on regressive K-serials and the Indian television industry, and on the glorification of English language in India. Kaur feels that spoken word is continuing the oral tradition so typical to poetry, and the scene has become larger. “There are certain limitations as it’s an event that is classist by nature – usually held at a bar and in English. But it’s still an important medium,” Kaur says. 
 
 Bijlani perceives one of the problem arising is advocacy not channelling into activism. “It isn’t difficult to go behind a mic and advocate for the women’s movement as a woman or a male ally. But the real work happens when we come out of slams. While poetry slams are a great place to rage together, to support each other in our fight, and build solidarity, the advocacy that happens inside also needs to be channelised into tangible, constructive activism outside of it,” she concludes.
