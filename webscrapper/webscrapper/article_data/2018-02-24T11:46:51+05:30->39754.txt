PUNE: Running a nursery and a garland business during the day and committing burglaries at night, a gang of four men broke into at least 14 flats since 2015.

 They, however, ran out of luck and landed in police net on February 12. “We have solved 14 cases of house break-ins and recovered stolen goods worth Rs 25 lakh from Jagashi Butiya (50) and his nephews, Bharat Butiya (35), Jayanti Butiya (32), and Rakesh Waghmare (32) since their arrest on February 12,” Basavraj Teli, deputy commissioner of police (zone-I), said in a news conference on Friday.
 
 The Butiyas, originally from Gujarat, used to run a nursery near their residence in Somatane Phata in Wadgaon Maval, Teli said, adding that Waghmare is their relative and hails from Dehu Road.
 
 During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they had sold the stolen items to the employee of a jewellery shop in Talegaon Dabhade. “We have arrested the jeweller’s employee, Shankar Barui (39) of West Bengal, and recovered 631g gold and 4kg silver ornaments, collectively worth Rs 25.45 lakh, from him,” Teli said.
 
 
 The gang was committing burglaries in the Kothrud and Karvenagar areas for the past three years. On February 12, police marshals Bhavrao Damse and Gaus Mulani of the Alankar police noticed three men travelling by a car in Karvenagar. “We stopped the car and found equipment like crowbars, cutters and screw drivers with the occupants,” Mulani said.
 
 Senior inspector Rekha Salunkhe told TOI that during questioning, the suspects admitted that they had broken into a bungalow on January 29 in Sahakarnagar and made off with valuables worth Rs 5.5 lakh. The investigating team comprised constables Nitin Kamble, Rajendra Landge, Usman Kalyani and Shrikant Chavan. “We are expecting to detect more cases,” Salunkhe said.
