Chandigarh: The mentioning of ‘Negro’ against the name of a black student has again triggered the debate on racial profiling and sensitisation of our community towards responsible addressal of people from diverse ethnic backgrounds. 

 Even though some police officials tried to justify the occurrence as an offhand mistake, strong reactions have emerged from the cities human rights officials.
 
 Speaking to TOI, coordinator of Centre for Human Rights and Duties Swarnjit Kaur said, “This is absolutely wrong and completely non-permissible use of language. I think deep-rooted ignorance and institutionalised lack of awareness is responsible for something like this. It should not be pardoned. We should take this seriously and sensitise Mohali police in this regard and see to it that it should never happen again.”
 
 Echoing similar thoughts, assistant professor at Centre for Human Rights and Duties Namita Gupta said, “Not just police, many people on the streets commit such mistakes. This is a problem that is never carefully dispelled through any mechanism be it family, home or schools. This lack of awareness spreads through a lot of other issues as well and is reflective of us as a society. We need to teach our children, youth and officials about responsible use of language and sensitise them about treating every ethnicity and community with respect. Even the media sometimes uses the same kind of language. But the way it has been taught and seen, people at many instances do not do it intentionally but it just happens.”
 
 Advocate and human rights activist Veena Singh said, “This is a derogatory term and we should not shield the police by simply calling them ignorant about this. They are simply working uninformed about this. Many a time, they even release pictures the names of the juvenile undertrials and convicts involved in a crime, which is also against law and should be checked.”
