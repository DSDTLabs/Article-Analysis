LUCKNOW: It is not for the first time that the Samajwadi bicycle is seeing abumpy ride. In the Delhi assembly elections in February 2015, the Election Commission of India allotted the bicycle as a free symbol to   (JKNPP) in two assembly constituencies. 

 According to ECI, Mehfuz Husain of JKNPP contested from Matia Mahal and Pawan Kumar from Rohtas Nagar. Both contested on the bicycle symbol, securing less than 100 votes each.
 
   , which had initially decided to contest the Delhi assembly polls, eventually did not jump into the fray, making the allotment process for ECI much easier. 
 
 However, prior the poll process began, both SP and JKNPP had approached ECI to allot them the bicycle as election symbol. 
 
 The ECI observed that since both parties have the same symbol and have sought concessions in terms of allotment of symbols, it is not possible to grant concession to either of them.
 
 "If Samajwadi Party sets up its candidate in a constituency where JKNPP has not fielded a candidate, the symbol 'bicycle' may be allotted to the candidate of SP, and vice versa," the ECI said. 
 
 ECI's letter said that where both parties have set up candidates, the symbol 'bicycle' may not be allotted to either candidate. "In that event, the candidates of these parties in such constituencies shall be allotted free symbols from the list."
