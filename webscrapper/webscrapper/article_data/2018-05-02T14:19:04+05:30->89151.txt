NEW DELHI: Tripura's chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb has again courted controversy, this time by saying that if anyone criticises his government "their nails need to be chopped off", reported ANI news agency.
 
 
 "It shouldn't happen that with my government, somebody points fingers at it or scratches it with their nails. Anyone who scratches it, their nails should be chopped off," said Deb in a speech, the video of which was tweeted by ANI.
 
 
 The CM used the analogy of what a vegetable vendor goes through to illustrate his point.
 
 "A vegetable seller brings fresh bottle gourd to market at 8 in the morning. By 9 am, so many people have touched it, it gets so many nail marks that it can't be sold. Then it must be either fed to a cow or taken back home. I will not allow that to happen to my government," he said, going on to then say critics' nails should be chopped off.
 
 
 
  
  
 Deb's latest comment comes on the heels of other controversial things he's said recently. 
 
 Two weeks ago, the   said that the internet existed during the time of the fictional Mahabharata. Last week he said, "mechanical engineers shouldn't join the civil service". Also last week he wondered how model   was crowned Miss World. 
 
 And on Sunday, he said the youth of Tripura should waste their time and run after government jobs, they should milk cows or open paan shops to earn a livelihood. "The youth here runs after political parties for several years to get a government job and wastes the vital time of their life, had the same youth instead of running after parties set up a paan shop he would have by now had a bank balance of Rs 5 lakh," said Deb.
