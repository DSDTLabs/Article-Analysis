The ban covers disposable plastic cups, plates, spoons and flex, but excludes garbage bin liners and PET bottles.

 The highlight of the ban is that both manufacturers and users will be penalized. The punishment is a fine ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 and a jail term of three months.
 
 The changes will be brought in with amendments to the Solid Waste Management Act 2016 and the Plastic Carry Bags (Manufacture and Usage) Rules 2006.
 
 Implementation will be the responsibility of local bodies and the state pollution control board (MPCB).
