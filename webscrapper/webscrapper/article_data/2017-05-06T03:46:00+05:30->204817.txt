NAGPUR:   has expressed confidence that the load shedding being done in the state will reduce or even stop within two or three days. However, data provided by Maharashtra State Load Despatch Centre (MSLDC) paints a different picture.

 A senior MSEDCL official told TOI that the 4,000MW shortfall was created as generation units having total capacity of 1,000MW were offline due to maintenance work. “Another 3,000MW sets were under breakdown. The generation increased by 700MW on Friday though. Soon all units under break down will come on line and the problem will be solved,” he said.
 
 The official further said even though the shortfall was over 3,000MW on Friday load shedding of only 1,200 to 1,700MW was done.
 
 These facts are at variance with the data available on Maharashtra State Load Despatch Centre (MSLDC) website. The SCADA date on Friday evening showed that unit 10 of Koradi (660MW), unit 4 of   plant (210MW) and Units 4 and 5 of Parli (210MW each). Thus only 1,290MW generation is not available on short term.
 
 Two 270MW units of RattanIndia plant at   are not generating due to coal shortage. It is difficult to bring them online in short term. “The problem is partly due to railways, which is unable to transport required amount of coal. As our plant was closed for nine months due to lack of demand, there is lack of synchronization between us and the coal companies,” a RattanIndia official told TOI. One 660MW unit of Adani’s Tiroda plant is under maintenance. This too will not start generation in short term.
 
 A source in MSEDCL said there were restrictions on use of water in   hydroelectric project because the state had used a large percentage of its share in the dam. If all these factors are taken into account load shedding may not end anytime soon.
