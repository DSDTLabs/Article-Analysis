PATNA: State   secretary   on Saturday said a fleet of 25 non-AC buses would start running between   near   and Danapur bus stand in western Patna via Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, commonly known as  , on a pilot basis by the end of this month.

 After leaving Bankipore bus depot, the buses will reach Danapur bus stand via SBI office near Gandhi Maidan, Dak Bungalow roundabout, Patna Junction, Bailey Road and Saguna Mor.
 
 Agarwal said the route, which is proposed for nonstop ring road service, would have 22 bus queue shelters. “Apart from beautification of the existing bus stops, some new bus stops will also some up,” he added.
 
 Agarwal, while taking a trial run in a bus run by Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC), inspected the bus stops on the route. He said a transport department team would remove encroachments from various bus stops.
 
 “Passengers can buy e-tickets in the bus itself. The fare will vary from Rs 5 to Rs 16, depending on total distance travelled by a passenger. Of the 32 seats in each bus, 16 or 50% will be reserved for women. Some seats will also be reserved for senior citizens, specially-abled and transgender. Three CCTV cameras will be installed in each bus from security point of view,” Agarwal said, adding the buses will run from 6.30am to 9pm. 
 
 Agarwal added Patna requires similar bus services on three other routes – Patna Junction to Mithapur bus stand, Rajendra Nagar to Patna Saheb and Patna Junction to All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, Phulwarisharif.
 
 “We felt the need for a dedicated bus service as many offices and hospitals are located on Gandhi Maidan-Danapur route,” Agarwal said.
 
 The transport department is also planning to introduce a monthly bus pass system for the common people and impose fine on those travelling without tickets.
