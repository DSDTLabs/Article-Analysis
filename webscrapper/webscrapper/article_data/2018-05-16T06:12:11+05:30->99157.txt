MUMBAI: An independent committee set up by the Bombay high court to probe the cause of a devastating fire at rooftop resto-bars in Kamala Mills Compound, Lower Parel, expressed “shock’’ and displeasure at “overnight destruction’’ of part of a rooftop area gutted by a fire last December. 

 
 The panel headed by former Chief Justice of the Kerala high court A V Savant has sought an enquiry into how a toilet was destroyed between May 11-12 and wants a report to be placed before it.
 
 The three-member committee also comprising former urban development secretary K Nalinakshan and an architect, along with BMC counsel Joel Carlos had visited the site. During the visit, which they had notified the BMC earlier, they noticed "attempts" were made to clean up the fire site by "demolishing'' the toilet area.
 
 Following the visit, G south ward office served a notice to Yug Pathak and Yug Tuli of Mojo, Abhijeet Mankar and Kripesh Sanghvi from 1Above as well as owner Ramesh Gowani of Kamala Mills asking them to maintain the premises as they are without tampering with any evidence on site.
 
 Meanwhile, a vacation bench of the Bombay high court on Tuesday concluded hearing bail pleas filed by Ramesh Gowani and co-accused Ravi Bhandari in a criminal case connected to the December 2017 fire that broke out in two rooftop restaurants killing 14 people. Their counsel Shyam Dewani argued that the builder’s case is “different” from that of the restaurant owners.
