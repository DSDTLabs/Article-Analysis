An artshow titled ‘Drawing Experience’ featuring works of 16 artists exploring alternative forms and installations was a sheer treat for art enthusiasts in the city. Curator   explains, “There is some visceral pleasure in scratching a surface with a line, to see it wriggle and evolve into a shape, a form that envelopes within its folds a world of multifold expressions . While these lines are regularly used as part of an art work, the idea of ‘Drawing Experience’ was to challenge these conventional methods with more innovative techniques by pushing that ‘line’ beyond; towards more freedom.”
The artists used experiments with media and material to break the conventional methods and to break into the three dimensions. As their subjects ranged from personal narratives, to socio-political issues and observations and even philosophical and poetic musings, there choice of media too varied from calligraphic strokes to scripts and shadows. Here are some of the highlights from the show.
