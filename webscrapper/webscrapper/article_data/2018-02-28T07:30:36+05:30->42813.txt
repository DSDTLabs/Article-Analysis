SURAT: Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) proposes to develop the upcoming   as a high density corridor in 2,669 hectare of land at an initial expense of Rs 606 crore. The first phase would be completed by March 2019 and the whole project could incur an expense of about Rs 5,100 crore when completed.

 The first phase of the project would see construction of a 42-metre-wide road with six lanes and two service roads on both sides with the middle corridor for BRTS and metro on a 27-km stretch. Overall, there would be 22 small bridges, one bridge over river  , two flyovers, three rail overbridges and five creek-canal underpasses which will go a long way towards facilitating the implementation of 11 town planning schemes.
 
 The state government gave its go ahead for the project on February 16 following which the concerned officials at a meeting on February 23 decided to start work on basic infrastructure facilities along the outer ring road in four packages. 
 
 “Tenders would be issued shortly and work would begin soon on Kadodara-Kamrej, Abrama-Variyav, Kadodara-Palsana and river Tapi bridge packages,” SUDA senior town planner S P Dutta said. 
 
 SUDA chairman and municipal commissioner   said, “This is an initial work of the project. Once we set up basic infrastructure in a year’s time, it would pave way for huge development around the outer periphery of Surat city.”
