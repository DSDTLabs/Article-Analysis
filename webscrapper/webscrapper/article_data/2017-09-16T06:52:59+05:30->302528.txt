The names of the inamdar still exist in land records of those districts. We're looking at amending them,“ he said.
 
 Thimappa said the deputy commissioners of North Karnataka districts have been asked to collate and provide all details in this matter. According to the minister, parts of Malnad and southern Karnataka districts have seen better implementation of the policy .
 
 Thimappa said the government plans to extend the timeframe for regularizing construc tions under Akrama-Sakrama.
 
 “We are considering extending the time-frame to submit petitions for regularization of properties under 94 C and 94 CC of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act,“ he said.
 
 According to Thimappa, 2.78 lakh applications under 94 C (urban areas) and 1.18 lakh applications under 94 CC (rural areas) are pending.
