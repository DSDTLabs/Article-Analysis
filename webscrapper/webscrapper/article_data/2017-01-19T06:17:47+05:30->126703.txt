MANALI: After a seven-year gap, the ski slopes of Solang will finally host the national   from February 2. Though, the local skiers and skiing association compare Solang slopes with international slopes, they say lack of infrastructure and government apathy are responsible for not hosting any national or international competitions.

  Winter Games Association (HPWGA) with the help of   (WGFI) and Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied   (ABVIMAS) will host the championships that will be held till February 6. 
 
 The slopes have received good snow, over 120cm thick. However, the organizers are still trying to collect funds for event, and even looking at government for some financial help.
 
 Teams from Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Shimla, ITBP and Army are expected to participate in the competition. Besides, individual skiers will also compete for the cup. Manali is said to have most number of professional skiers in the country but this tourist town fails to host any national event due to lack of funds. 
 
 HPWGA president Roopu Negi said his team has chalked out a complete plan and will not let down the winter games lovers. “The only concern is funding of the event. But we shall organize it at any cost. We shall select the skiers for national on January 28 and 29 at the slopes. The competition will hold in alpine skiing and snowboarding,” he said.
 
 The basic requirement of a ski slope is a snow beating machine that grooms the snow surface to make it worth skiing. Both Auli and Gulmarg have such machines. Despite promises by government to provide this machine to Solang, skiers are still waiting for it. On the name of ski infrastructure, Solang has a ski chair lift which is in dilapidated condition.
