NEW DELHI:   today called the Congress’s protest as “unwarranted” after latter objected to its leader 
  during the   celebration in the capital held on Friday.

 
 Following the protest by the   party, BJP said that the democracy is structured around rules and not people.
 
 "  was given the seat during Republic Day parade as per the protocol, rules & traditions. The controversy created by Congress party is unwarranted & an example of cheap politics. It shows that Congress party still believes in aristocracy and not in democracy," said Rao.
 
  
  
 Yesterday, during the Republic Day celebrations in the capital, the seating plan for Rahul prompted an angry response from Congress. During the event, he was seen seated in the sixth row with the leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad.
 
 Congress protested against the seating plan calling it a "deliberate" attempt by an “arrogant” government to shame the president of the largest opposition party in the country.
 
 Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said the Modi government's "cheap politics" was at display today when it broke tradition and denied Gandhi a front-row seat.
 
  
  
 Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid supported Surjewala and said that it was "more 
  ".
 
 "Rahul Gandhi is not just a Congress MP anymore. He is also the president of India's largest opposition party. And if the ruling party doesn't understand that position, it is unfortunate," he said.
 
 Earlier, other BJP members held the same opinion as Rao’s and recalled that during the United Progressive Alliance government led by the Congress, leaders of opposition in the two Houses, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, were allotted seats which were way behind.
