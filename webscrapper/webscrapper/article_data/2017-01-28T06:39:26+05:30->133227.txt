Islamabad: After taking Bol news channel off the air, the   regulator issued a show cause notice to it on Friday for breaching its ban on a TV talk show host for spreading hatred and threatening people in his programme "Aisay Nahi Chalay Ga". 

  Despite a ban on  , a TV show host and religious televangelist, the TV station had allowed the belligerent broadcaster to appear on TV on Thursday, defying the orders of   (Pemra). 
 
 "Aamir Liaquat shall not host any programme, or appear on TV in any manner fresh, old or repeat including (but not limited to) as a guest, analyst, reporter, actor, in audio, video beeper, promo/advertisement of his programme or in person, in any manner whatsoever...with immediate effect," said the Pemra order issued on Thursday.
 
 Aamir Liaquat, however, went ahead with his show and criticised the regulator's decision to take his show off the air. The move led Pemra to take the channel off-air. The TV host claimed that the owner of a rival media group, GEO, and his son were behind the ban.
