NEW DELHI: For the second consecutive year, Delhi missed its characteristic  . While the month had more cold days than December, temperatures stayed above normal on a majority of days — one of the reasons for which, ironically, could be the relatively clean winter air this season. 

 The month ended with the average minimum temperature 1.1 degree Celsius higher than normal and the average maximum 0.7 degrees above par. As monthly averages go, these deviations are significant although lower than what was seen in January last year, which was an exceptional warm month.
 
 Night temperatures dropped below 5 degrees C on just four days during the month while maximum temperatures were significantly lower than normal on three days. Compare this to 10 ‘cold days’ in January 2015 (significantly lower maximum temperatures) and 11 days when the mercury dropped below 5 degrees in January 2013.
 
 So why did Delhi witness a mild winter even though the western Himalayas saw   this January? Meteorologists said this could due to several local and largescale factors. “This season, the cold did not get transmitted significantly from the hills to the plains of north and central India. That’s because the position of ‘western disturbances’ (cold, moist winds from southern Europe) was mostly a little more to the north, which affected only J&K and Himachal Pradesh,” said  , head of IMD’s long term forecasts, which had predicted a mild winter in India this year.
 
 Interestingly, the relatively low pollution levels this month could also have contributed to the higher-than-normal daytime temperatures, a Met official said.
 
 “The month had 58 hours of fog across 13 days. That’s not unusual. However, unlike in the past, the fog occurred mostly at night or in the mornings. Afternoons were relatively clear. This may be a result of lower air pollution because pollutants increase fog,” the official said.
