Panaji:   SC are worried that their campaign in the Goa Professional League will be further derailed due to haphazard season-end scheduling.
 
  Churchill Brothers still have 10 matches left to be played in the   but their solitary goal loss against   on Wednesday suggests that the team needs adequate rest to get back into the groove.
  
  They may not have that luxury, though, as the Goa Football Association needs to complete the league before next month’s Bandodkar Gold Cup and Churchill still have 10 matches left to be played. Even if Churchill Brothers are afforded just three day’s rest, they will still need a month to complete their league engagements.
  
  “Our schedule is crazy. We played today (Wednesday), our next match is on Friday, just 48 hours later, and then we play our third game in a week,” said coach  .
  
  Churchill – who have 13 points from 12 matches in the local league — were busy with their   battle in Bhubaneshwar and arrived in Goa only late on Tuesday after a long flight. They were originally scheduled to take a 8.30am flight which was cancelled. They immediately booked themselves on a later flight to Bengaluru, and by the time they took the connecting flighand reached home, it was 9.30pm. “Imagine playing a professional match immediately the next day. We are humans and not machines. We need sufficient rest. I am not giving excuses for today’s loss but you can see the reality for yourself,” said Alfred.
  
  A 56th minute goal from Josley Dias helped Calangute Association register a hard fought 1-0 win over Churchill Brothers at Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa on Wednesday. Churchill had chances to win but prodigality haunted them in the second session as a freekick from Domnic Fernandes was headed home by Josley Dias.
