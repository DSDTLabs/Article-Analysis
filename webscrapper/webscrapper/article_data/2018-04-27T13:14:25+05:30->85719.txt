The fourth song from   starrer ‘Kande’ is out. Titled ‘Baapu De Kille 40’, the song boasts of the power of money quite loud.

 If you have seen the trailer, then decoding the song would be easier. The trailer gives the idea of a revenge drama, wherein Yograj Singh does everything in his power to drag the lead,   into the dark lanes of drug and alcohol addiction. As the song unfolds, Yograj can be seen playing his move, wherein he tries to spoil the lead in the disguise of a good host.
 
 Written by Baaz, the song perfectly gives a glimpse of how the lead might fall into a major trap. Gurmeet Singh’s music and Geeta Zaildar’s voice have given the song an extra edge.
 
 Scheduled to release on May 11, 2018, ‘Kande’ will also feature the game of kabaddi in some parts.
