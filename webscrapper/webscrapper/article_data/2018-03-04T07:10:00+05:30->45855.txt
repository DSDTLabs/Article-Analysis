Ludhiana: Two days after TOI highlighted how 360 students were made to sit on 180 benches during class XII exam on environment in Government College for Girls near Bharat Nagar, the official of district education department woke up to the violation of board exam rules and arranged for more classrooms and benches to conduct the Punjabi exam.

 On Friday, the TOI highlighted how two students were made to share a desk during the exam.
 
 Government College for Girls has been made an examination centre for as many as 471 students. Out of total students, 360 students were accommodated in the auditorium while 111 students were accommodated in three classrooms.
 
 In the absence of sufficient classrooms and benches, officials made two students sit on one desk in the auditorium. Centre superintendent Harjeet Singh had said he had already brought the matter to the notice of district education officer (secondary) Swaranjit Kaur about the shortage of classrooms and desks due to which they were forced to make two students sit on every desk, which is against the rules.
 
 Whereas the education department has blamed the college authorities for not providing sufficient classrooms and desks, the college on other hand had said they needed classrooms and desks for their own students.
 
 Importantly, the anti-cheating teacher front has also filed a complaint with the secretary education and PSEB against this rule violation.
 
 President Sukhdarhsan Singh said, “This is the failure of the education department which failed to make sufficient arrangements for board exams. Making two students sit on a desk is a clear violation of rules. Our organization has filed a complaint with the secretary education and chairman of PSEB on the matter.”
 
 DEO (secondary) Sawarnjit Kaur said, “I talked to the college authorities and on Saturday, they provided us four more classrooms and desks to conduct the exam.”
