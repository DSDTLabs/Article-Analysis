For the past three months, a team of heritage experts have been scouting the lanes of Serampore, Chandernagore, Chinsurah and Bandel to create a map of a ‘mini Europe’ that lies hidden in these cities. While a few mammoth public buildings from the Raj era have garnered some attention, very little has been said about the private dwellings, that too are part of the colonial legacy of Hooghly as they bear an imprint of architectural styles of the Danes, the French, the Dutch and the Portuguese from the sixteenth century onwards, much before the British decided to settle in Kolkata.

 The team comprises architects from  , who have collaborated with IIT-Kharagpur faculty and researchers to draw up a map of every important heritage private dwelling in the four cities.
 
 The project is being jointly funded by Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK and  . The project will go on till January 2020. The findings will then be handed over to the state and central governments as ready reckoner.
 
  from   said, “Despite the fact that Hooghly houses a heritage treasure trove, the kind of focus it deserves from the administration is missing.”
 
 At least 20 residential buildings have been mapped so far in Chinsurah and Chandernagore. Once identification is over, architects will draw up a blueprint of restoration to be handed over to the owners.
 
 “The biggest problem is that of subinfeudation or the fact that one building has several heirs fighting legal battles for ownership. Lack of funds for maintenance is another issue,” Mukherjee said.The Indian National Trust on Art and Cultural Heritage ( ) has also offered help in the restoration said state convener G M Kapur.
