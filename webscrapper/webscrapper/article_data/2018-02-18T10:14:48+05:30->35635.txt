 Speaking at a press conference in Kochi on Saturday, Ashokan KM, the father of   (born Akhila) and  , the mother of ‘Nimisha’ (who allegedly joined ISIS), claimed that the children of 30 families were ‘love jihad’ victims. “It is sad that government and police are adopting an attitude that’s favouring the terrorists in such cases. This forced us to form this collective,” Ashokan said.
 
 “Many girls have committed suicide whereas some of them were killed or subjected to sexual abuse. Nobody knows where they are now. NIA and police investigated cases and revealed names of many individuals and organizations who are the real culprits and accomplices. Still, police and government have failed to take action,”   said.
