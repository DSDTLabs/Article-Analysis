AMRITSAR:   jathedar   has expressed concern over the halo missing in the   even as worship of idols and photographs is discouraged in the religion. 

 Talking to TOI on Wednesday, the jathedar said Akal Takht secretariat had received numerous written and telephonic complaints from abroad against gurus’ photographs being printed without the halo around their head. “Principally, the photographs of gurus can’t be given recognition in the religion. Still, it is worrisome that a an attempt is being made to hurt religious sentiments by printing photographs of Sikh gurus without the halo,” he said.
 
 Though he clarified that Sikhs were neither worshippers of photographs of gurus nor did they offer anything to the photos, he claimed that a halo represented that the person whose photograph was printed was divine.
 
 He said that deviating from the path shown by gurus, a few people had started printing their photographs without the nimbus, thus leaving no difference between them and common men.
