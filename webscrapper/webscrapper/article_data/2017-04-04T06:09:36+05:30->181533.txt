CHENNAI: With a large number of hotels and restaurants facing closure for want of mandatory parking facilities, as per the February 10 judgment of the  , the first bench has now decided to expedite hearing of the case.

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and justice RMT Teekaa Raman agreed to hear the case on Tuesday instead of the originally scheduled date of April 13, after senior counsel P S Raman mentioned the matter . On Monday the senior counsel mentioned it and said hotels and restaurants were being issued show cause notices and closure orders irrespective of the fact that they still had their licence period.
 
 It started with a PIL filed by S Raghu of Vyasarpadi seeking closure of restaurants/eateries if they did not provide adequate parking space and fire safety measures. After series of orders and warnings during the past two years of litigation, the then first bench headed by then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul ruled on February 10 that the progress report filed by authorities revealed that the hotels and restaurants lacking adequate parking facilities had been taking the court and officials for a ride. Permitting the eateries to have valet parking facilities had not been followed, the bench pointed out.
 
 However, after authorities started issuing notices and orders on errant hotels, the Chennai Hotels Association got impleaded as party to the proceedings and sought to modify the ruling. Claiming that the enforcing authorities had misconstrued and misread the judgement, the association said the Second Master Plan had suggested different parking requirements for different restaurants based on the size and category of the restaurants.
