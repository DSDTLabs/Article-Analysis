PATNA: The   (BSSC) question paper leak scam has given opposition parties as well as JD(U)’s alliance partner RJD an opportunity to corner CM Nitish Kumar for his alleged failure to check widespread irregularities in the commission.
 
  While RJD, an ally in Nitish’s Mahagathbandhan government, has termed the scam a blot on Bihar, the BJP held the CM responsible for it as the commission is controlled by general administration department (GAD), which is under Nitish. The examination to recruit employees in different departments was cancelled by the CM on Wednesday after detection of large scale irregularities and question paper leak.
  
    minister and RJD vice president   said topper and recruitment scams have tarnished the image of Bihar. “The government has failed to check scams, which is not a good sign for the state,” Singh said. The senior RJD functionary had criticised the government last year too when the Intermediate topper scam had surfaced.
  
  BJP spokesman   said the CM cannot wash his hands of the scam by cancelling the examinations. “The state should have taken steps to check corruption in BSSC. Since BSSC is controlled by GAD, which is under CM, he cannot shrug off his responsibility,” Jha said.
  
  JD (U) spokesman  , however, defended the government, saying no one will be allowed to tarnish the image of the state. “The USP of Nitish government is zero tolerance towards corruption. The moment the scam surfaced, an SIT was formed and corrupt people were put behind bars within 24 hours. However mighty a person may be, he will not be spared,” he said.
  
  On difference within the alliance on the issue, Singh said the alliance partners should refrain from making adverse comments against the government.
