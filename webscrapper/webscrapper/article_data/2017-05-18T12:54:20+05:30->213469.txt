BHOPAL: A 60 to 120 seconds halt at traffic signals could soon lead to an uninterrupted drive on two main thoroughfares of Bhopal. A meeting of traffic police and   Municipal Corporation (BMC) on this regard would be held to bring resolve issues of unsynchronised traffic signals in the city.

 According to ASP traffic Sameer Yadav, “Traffic signals along the stretch from New Market to Kamla Park and   to Chetak Bridge – would be synchronised soon.”
 
 The signalling system in the city is maintained and installed by the municipal corporation, whereas traffic police keeps a check on the vehicular movement. Interestingly, the current technology used by the BMC to regular traffic signals is out of date.
 
 The problem with the current infrastructure is the fact that in case of a power outage or signal lights being turned off; the synchronisation format needs to be reloaded. It results in irregular linkages between one signal and another on the same stretch.
 
 “We envisage that once a vehicle hits a green signal at Board Office it would be all clear till it crosses the signal before the Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT) near the Chetak Bridge. Similarly, a right turn to New Market from Link Road 1 would ensure a green light till Banganga Square near the Polytechnic,” Yadav said. The same would be true for vehicles moving in the opposite direction.
 
 Experts indicate that a ride to the airport from the commercial market would lead to signals at Banganga, Polytechnic Square, MLB College, Shyamla petrol pump, Kilol Park and Shankar Dayal Sharma Square.
 
 The average halt time for a five kilometre drive in Bhopal is about three to five minutes and is likely to increase if signals are not regulated.
 
 BMC officials said all the new tenders for signals would make it mandatory for the operator to adopt the latest signal synchronisation technology.
