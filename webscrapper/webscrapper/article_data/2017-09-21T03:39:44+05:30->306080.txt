NEW DELHI: Three days after a man was stabbed to death in a   attack in east Delhi’s  , cops on Wednesday arrested all the four accused.

 Police said two men — Nishant Arora and Gaurav Sharma — had been stabbed multiple times on Saturday night when they tried to intervene in an altercation between the four motorcycle-borne accused and a car driver. Nishant died of his wounds on the spot. A friend of the two, Ashish Tyagi, who was also present at the eatery where the incident took place, escaped unhurt, police said, and took his bleeding friends to hospital. Sharma is still not said to be out of danger, the police said.
 
 The four arrested persons have been identified as Deepanshu Chabra (24), Devender Sharma (24), Gagan Vermani (22) and Gurfan (22). Police said three of them have criminal records. They were arrested on Wednesday from Haridwar, to where they had fled.
 
 DCP (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad said Nishant, Gaurav and Ashish were heading towards Jheel Chowk in Geeta Colony on a scooter when they stopped at an eatery for dinner. Moments later, they found four motorcyclists fighting with a car driver.
 
 According to the police, the four accused were returning from a party in Gandhi Nagar. They were on motorcycles in a narrow lane when the car came from the opposite side.
 
 “Both parties engaged in a scuffle when they asked each other to reverse their vehicles. In the meantime, the three friends arrived on a scooter and tried to pacify the others. The three pushed aside the four accused, allowing the car to leave,” said DCP Prasad.
