THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In terms of overall cleanliness, sanitation and awareness campaigns, Kerala’s major cities lag far behind other cities in India, according to rankings released by   survey 2017 conducted by the Union ministry of urban development, though   officials here claimed that the parameters of the survey don’t reflect the state’s far more effective decentralised mode.

 Of the nine AMRUT (Atal mission for regeneration and urban transformation) cities in   which were surveyed as part of the mission, not even one city managed to score above 1,000 points — Kozhikode came closest with 887 points. In the all-India rankings, Kozhikode was ranked a lowly 254.
 
 Swachh Survekshan survey was conducted in 434 cities in the country chosen under AMRUT scheme. The cities were evaluated based on waste collection, sweeping and transportation, municipal solid waste-processing and disposal, open defecation free/toilets, information, education and behaviour change and capacity building. The ranking was based on three sources -- data from civic bodies, independent observation and citizen feedback. All three major corporations in the state — Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode — slipped from their 2016 rankings. Thiruvananthapuram, which was ranked 40 out of 73 cities in the 2016 survey with 1,167 points, was the worst performer with 617 points and a rank of 372 this year.
