AHMEDABAD:   of city   on Wednesday arrested two persons, in separate cases, for creating fake social media profiles of women.

  In both cases the accused had tried to defame their victims, by portraying them as sex workers and posting their mobile numbers on social networking sites.
 
  of the cyber cell said that they arrested Prakash  , 44, of Nava Vadaj. “On interrogating him, it emerged that Rajgor, who works as a driver, had come in contact with a woman working at a beauty parlour in  ,” said inspector Geddam.
 
 Rajgor created a fake profile of the woman on a social media site and uploaded photos of her. “Rajgor also posted the woman’s mobile number and portrayed her as a sex worker,” said a cyber cell official.
 
 This caused tremendous harassment for the woman, who started receiving lewd calls from various numbers.
 
 “She then lodged a complaint with us. We have arrested Rajgor, who we suspect is a habitual offender and may have also posted the numbers of other women on social media,” said a cyber crime official.
 
 In the second incident, cyber cell sleuths arrested a jilted lover, Ritik Sinha, 21, of Isanpur, who took a girl’s photos from her social media profile and made a fake profile by the name of ‘Pooja Rajput’ and posted the girl’s mobile number there.
 
 Cyber cell officials said they traced Sinha from the IP address provided by the social media company and arrested him.
