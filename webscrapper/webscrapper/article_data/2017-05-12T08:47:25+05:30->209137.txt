PANAJI: Small-hotel owners called on chief minister   on Thursday urging him to ensure that a   of 5% was levied on budget hotels under Goods & Services Tax (GST) instead of the 18% that is likely to be levied on the service sector.

 The  , backed by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( ), said that a low tax rate would ensure that the tax burden was not passed on to the customer. 
 
 According to industry stakeholders,  , which charge a tariff of less than Rs 2,000 per room night comprise 80% of Goa’s hotel market.
 
 “We want to be a part of one-nation-one-tax regime. We just don’t want it to happen at the cost of our business – there is no way the budget hotel industry will be able to sustain a high GST slab,” said Randhir Thakur, proprietor of Sodder’s Renton Manor.
 
 The Union government has invited representations to hear concerns and feedback from the industry ahead of a critical discussion on GST during the third week of May.
 
  Hoteliers stated that low tax rates will significantly increase foreign and domestic travel in India and that budget hotels are a source of gainful employment for thousands of people.
