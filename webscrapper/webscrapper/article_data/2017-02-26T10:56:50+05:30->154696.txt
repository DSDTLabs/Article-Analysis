PUNE: The inability to use the Decision Review System judiciously did play a role in India's humiliating defeat in the first Test. Indians, who wasted a majority of their reviews in the first innings, didn't learn their lessons even in the second essay.

 It was no different on Saturday as first,   used the referral after England's   had adjudged him leg-before wicket to left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe in the fifth over of the second innings. It boiled down to 'umpire's call'.
 
 Then,  , who was completely squared up by  , used up the other one, albeit after a long chat with  , the non-striker. It again came back as 'umpire's call'.
 
 So, how much should the players be blamed for getting the referrals wrong?
 
 While one cannot be 100 per cent sure, it's a combination of the player involved and the batsman or bowler wicketkeeper being reasonably sure about what has happened, and a bit of tactics.
 
 Indians, who were against the use of DRS all these years, now seem to have gone to the other extreme -asking for a review at the first opportunity.
 
 On the first day of the Test here, twice Kohli opted for review unsuccessfully within the first 40 overs. Kohli, who was stationed square of the wicket, was not ideally placed to judge the line of the delivery. He duly consulted the bowler and wicketkeeper before requesting the umpire for a review. Fair to say, Indians got it wrong collectively.
 
 At the end of the second day's play, head coach   dismissed the contention that his players had wasted the reviews. "I don't think so... I think in the previous two series -against England and Bangladesh -we were better off in this regard than the opposition," he pointed out.
 
 Now, Indians are sure to be more circumspect while asking for reviews.
