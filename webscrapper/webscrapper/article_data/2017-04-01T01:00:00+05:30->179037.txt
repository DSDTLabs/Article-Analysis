Meherzan Mazda, who is seen as the male lead in ' ', had a rather tough task to achieve. He had to put on 16 kilos in a month-and-a-half for his show. While his efforts to transform his appearance have been appreciated, the extra weight is causing him a lot of problems. He says, ‘‘Ever since I have gained weight, I am unable to sleep well, as I have started snoring. I have also developed hypertension. I get worked up easily and have become lazy. Earlier, I would hog everything and it seemed like a blessing in disguise since I am a foodie. However, I am now following a strict diet.”
