PANAJI: After rejecting applications to open 15 new English medium primary schools, the directorate of education (DoE) will decide on the applications for regional language   only after the current academic year ends on April 30, officials said.

 But, sources say that even most regional language schools are unlikely to get permissions as they may not clear the feasibility report, where they are not seen to adversely affect existing schools in the neighbourhood.
 
 For the academic year 2018-19, DoE has received 61 applications to open new primary schools in the state. Of these, 24 applications are from educational institutions and trusts to open Konkani-medium schools, 14 to start Marathi-medium schools, seven to begin   medium institutions, and one to open a Sindhi language school. Another 15 institutes and trusts had sought permissions to open English-medium schools from June 2018.
 
 In 2012, as part of its medium of instruction (MOI) policy, the state government allowed new   or Marathi-medium primary schools to open by relaxing norms for them like distance criteria from existing schools. 
 
 As a result of this policy, between 2012 and 2016, over 90 regional language primary schools were allowed to begin operations and no English-medium school has been given clearance due to the ongoing row over grants to English-medium primary schools. Subsequently, during the last two years, no new regional language primary schools have been permitted to open as well.
