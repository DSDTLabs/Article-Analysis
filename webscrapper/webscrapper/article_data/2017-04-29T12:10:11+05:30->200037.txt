: I am a 28-year-old girl. I love my younger sister but I can't fight the feeling that everyone in the family feels she is sharper and smarter. And as unfair it could get, she is fairer and taller than me. She has never been in a stable relationship and always have boys falling for her. I have just started my first ever relationship. My sister looks seemingly excited about my relationship and keeps pestering me to bring him home. The problem is that I don't want him to meet my sister. I am feeling insecure and I fear that he will also fall for her eventually and I don't want to lose him.

 
 : It's very normal to feel insecure about your relationship, rather insecurity and jealousy are emotions which sometimes help bring a couple closer. While it's not uncommon to feel insecure about your partner with friends or outsiders, I can understand your feelings where you are feeling insecure with your own sister basing on your past experiences. While I wouldn't want to disregard your feelings at this point, I also feel that making your sister meet your boyfriend may serve two purposes as well- one you'll be able to face your fear of having your boyfriend meet your sister and secondly, you can also gauge the seriousness and commitment levels of your boyfriend towards you. While I also understand your fear of losing your boyfriend to your sister, if he's serious he's going to be loyal to you no matter who the person on the other end is, and on the flip side if he has to cheat, he can cheat upon you with anyone - your sister, friend or any stranger.
