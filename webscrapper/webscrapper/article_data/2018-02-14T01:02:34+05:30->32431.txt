Trichy: A section of farmers headed by president of All Farmers Associations’ Coordination Committee PR Pandian took out a rally from Tiruvarur towards Kabini reservoir in Karnataka to release Cauvery water from the dam. Despite repeated appeals by farmers from the delta region and letters sent by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, the neighbouring state has been in denial mode to release water from Cauvery, said PR Pandian, before left from Tiruvarur here on Tuesday. “Since there is no required water in Mettur reservoir, we need at least 15 tmc of water to save the standing samba paddy crop in delta districts immediately. The Karnataka government neither lent its ear to the cries of farmers nor the repeated letter sent by the CM,” he alleged. Around 70 farmers have left for Karnataka by 13 cars and plan to gather 500 famers on the way. “Since they are refusing to release water from Kabini reservoir, we have decided to release water from the dam,” he said. Pandian also demanded the state government to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the issue, before they reached the reservoir.
