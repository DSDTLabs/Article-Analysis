HYDERABAD: After referring to K Chandrasekhar Rao as a 'hard working and 'smart' chief minister on the first day of his political tour in Telangana on Monday, the   ( ) leader Pawan Kalyan, went a step further and said "I love KCR," at a meeting with his party workers in Karimnagar on Tuesday. 

  "Why does the   have a problem if I express my appreciation for KCR?" asked Pawan, who had convened a meeting of his party workers from three Lok   constituencies to spell out the policies of the party. But all through his speech, his fans kept shouting "leader" and "CM" to cheer him. 
 
 "I am like a brother to you, and a member of your family for your mothers and sisters. Lend me your support," he said while announcing once again that the JSP would contest the polls in Telangana in 2019.
 
 "When you shout 'Jai Telangana', it has the same effect on me as when I hear 'Vande Mataram'. I have always loved Telangana," he declared. Pawan Kalyan said one should have the spirit of nationalism, but at the same time respect regions and their culture. 
 
 Pawan Kalyan said when the World Telugu Conference was held in Hyderabad, he had initially decided to hold a press conference and speak out against poets and writers from AP not being invited. The actor also said that he would not be affected by those who criticized him.
