 Trichy: Relatives of a 40-year-old man blocked the Trichy-Chennai highway near Thevaiyur in Perambalur district, after he was knocked down by a speeding lorry, leaving him battle for his life on Saturday.
 
 The protestors reiterated the demand to build a bridge to cross the highway safety. Police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the protestors, after they refused to move from the place causing traffic congestion. 
 
 The victim identified as Srinivasan from Veppanthattai village sustained multiple fractures and was rushed to a private hospital. Thevaiyur villagers and Srinivasan’s relatives blocked the highway demanding a foot-over bridge to prevent such repeated accidents.
 
 “In a similar accident in January, a man on a motorcycle was hit by speeding vehicle while he tried to cross highway. We have been demanding a bridge facilitating a safe crossover, avoiding the highway, but that has fallen on the deaf ears of the authorities, leaving us no option but to block the highway,” said a relative of Srinivasan, S Chandru.
 
 Meanwhile police sources said that exercising caution while crossing the highway could have avoided the accident. “We too had no option but to lathicharge the protesters, since vehicles lined up on both sides of the highway, creating inconvenience to the public,” an official said.
