Coimbatore: Efforts are on to capture the lone tusker, which killed a farmer and another elderly man at Rayakottai forest range in Krishnagiri three days ago. A team of forest department field staff and veterinarians is camping in the reserve forest area to catch the 18-year-old elephant by darting it with sedatives. According to foresters, the tusker had been roaming in Soolagiri area after it got separated from its herd. After the animal attacked a cow on January 24, forest officials from Hosur chased away the elephant, which then moved to Semmankuttai that falls under Royakottai forest range. Three days ago, the tusker trampled a farmer, identified as Rajappa, 60, to death. Two others, Ranganathan and Munikrishnan, were injured in its attack. The animal also attacked Muniraj, 60, of Devarkuttapalli and he died on the spot. The relatives of Muniraj initially refused to receive the body from a government hospital, but district administration and forest department officials held talks with them and the issue was settled amicably. The officials also promised the people to capture the elephant.
