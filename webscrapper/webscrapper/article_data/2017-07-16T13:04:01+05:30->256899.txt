PANAJI: National Democratic Alliance’s ( ) presidential candidate   landed in Goa on Saturday to hold a meeting as part of his nationwide campaign to garner support from legislatures. The meet, attended by all MLAs of the coalition government, lasted about 45 minutes.

 Union minister for road transport and highways   expressed confidence in Kovind becoming the next President. 
 
 “We had a meeting with all the ministers and MLAs of the state government along with all the alliance partners of the NDA. All of them have assured us of their support to Ram Nath Kovind. We are confident he’ll win the presidential polls on July 17 by at least 70% of the total votes,” he said.
 
 Talking further about the message that Kovind gave to all the alliance partners, Gadkari said the presidential candidate will treat everyone equally. “Kovind told the legislative members that the Constitution of the country is the only guide for a President and he will follow that as well. He’ll treat everyone equally, irrespective of caste, creed or religion,” Gadkari said.
 
 Highlighting the importance that BJP gives to smaller states in decision making, CM Manohar Parrikar said Kovind’s visit marks an important first where a presidential candidate has come to ask for support. 
 
 “This is probably the first time that the presidential candidate has gone to states that don’t have many votes as compared to the bigger ones. Ram Nath Kovind has visited Goa as well as the north eastern states to ask for their support,” Parrikar said, adding that Goa holds significance for the NDA government at the centre.
