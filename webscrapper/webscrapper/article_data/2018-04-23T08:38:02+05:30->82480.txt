LUDHIANA: A 55-year-old tractor driver and his 24-year-old son have been booked for attempting to rape a woman when her husband was away to his native state.

 In her police complaint, the 30-year-old survivor said her husband, who works as a labourer in the city, had gone to Uttar Pradesh. She said on February 11, the accused, on finding her alone, barged into her room. First, the tractor driver tried to rape her and then his son too joined him. When she resisted, they manhandled her, she added.
 
 She told the police that she managed to come out of her room and raised the alarm, after which the accused ran away. Police said because of unknown reasons, the woman lodged the complaint on March 16 and after an inquiry, a case was registered on Saturday.
 
 The police have booked the accused under sections 376 and 511 of the IPC. Investigating officer ASI   said the accused were on the run and raids were being conducted to arrest them. 
 
 The tractor driver knew the woman for years as she and her family lived in the house of his brother. The father-son duo kept a watch on her and were looking for an opportunity to sexually abuse her, a cop said.
 
 Sources said the accused also beat up the woman while attempting to rape her. They added that the accused would have frequent fights with the family of the complainant.
