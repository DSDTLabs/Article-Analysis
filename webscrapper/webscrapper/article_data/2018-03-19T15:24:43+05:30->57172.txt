CHENNAI: Coffee, camera and camaraderie --- all this awaits you at this  . Organised by Fearless   Photographers Chennai, it invites women of all age groups who have an interest in photography to participate.

 “I have done several such events on my own but this is the first one with the Fearless Women   Chennai,” says photographer Shannon Zirkle, who will be leading the trek on   on March 24. “It is completely free of charge,” she says.
 
 Participants have to gather on the beach by 4:30pm. “We will grab some filter coffee and head to the fishing village nearby and the Broken Bridge. I will tell participants how to tell a story through photographs. I will tell them how to use different angles, composition etc," says Zirkle. “We will finish the trek by the beach in time to catch the sunset.”
 
 Zirkle is the founder of the Fearless Women Photographers Chennai, which was launched more than a year ago. She found that there are a large number of women shutterbugs; all they need is a little bit of encouragement. And that’s exactly what the group does -- by giving them a common platform to showcase their work and providing constructive feedback.
 
 “This event is also about building up the group, by providing a space where women photographers can get to know each other,” says Zirkle. Women of all age groups – amateur or professional -- can participate. Zirkle has even got a call from an eight-year-old, she says. All they need is an interest in photography.
 
 No fancy equipment is required, so women can use a DSLR or a cellphone camera. “I believe whatever camera you have is the best one,” says Zirkle. But she has a word of warning for participants. “We always start our events on time,” she says.
 
 The photo trek will be held from 4:30pm to 6pm. People have to register at: https://goo.gl/forms/D8Ey9V1ohbeGqDTD3
