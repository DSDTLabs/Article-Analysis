NEW DELHI: A 20-year-old woman was strangled and then   with an iron   at her   on Sunday night in front of her one-year-old child. Police are probing into the role of a tenant who recently had a falling out with the woman’s husband. As the room was ransacked, cops suspect the attacker may have stolen some things.

 A child in the neighbourhood saw the infant crying beside the dead woman and called her parents. The police were informed after the woman’s husband, Raj Kumar, arrived at the house. The woman, Rinku, was found lying on her bed with a dupatta around her neck. The killer had used the iron rod to break open an almirah, allegedly to steal jewellery.
 
 The woman’s husband, Raj Kumar, sells spices on the footpath. Though the woman’s family doesn’t suspect any foul play on the part of her husband and in-laws, they are being questioned by the police to find out the motive behind the murder.
 
 The entry to the house was friendly. Broken glass suggests that the killer had an argument with the woman after which he strangled her, police said.
 
 Raj Kumar and Rinku were married two years ago. They had shifted to Delhi from their village in West Bengal six months ago. Raj Kumar started selling spices, while Rinku looked after their child. They had leased a room and then sub-leased it to a man known to Raj Kumar.
 
 A case under IPC 302 has been registered and a manhunt launched to nab the missing tenant. A team may be sent to the woman’s hometown to verify her antecedents.
