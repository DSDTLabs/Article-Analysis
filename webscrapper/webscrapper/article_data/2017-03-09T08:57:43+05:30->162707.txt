DHARAMSHALA: On the eve of  , a woman took an intiative and   to females at a   owned by her. With this she added another credential — she was the first woman transporter in   and now her pump has become the first one in the state to employ females for filling fuel in vehicles.

 Nirmal Sethi (65) told TOI on Wednesday that it was late in the evening the day before that the idea struck her. “Two girls of the region Madhu and Sunita had been wanting a job and I offered them this, which they happily accepted. I am surprised that they are doing it very well now,” she said.
 
 Sethi said that being a female she was the first to start the business as a transporter in the hill state. “It was in 1978 when I started the business of transport. I had travelled in trucks and buses along with the drivers and had handled the business successfully before opening a petrol pump,” she added.
 
 It was in December 2005 when Nirmal had lost her husband. Social activists of the region have praised this move of her by opening one more door to females. “Sunita is a widow and was in dire need of the job. This is really a great step,” Yogesh Kumar, a social worker here, said. Madhu belongs to Palampur and was seeking financial support for the family.
 
 Sethi had only two daughters, which she said are like sons to her. “My daughters are fully cooperating in my business. Both are married and handling their families too” she said, adding that after transport it was in 1983 that she had entered the business of petrol pump.
 
 Meanwhile, the Tibetan Women's Association at Mcleodganj too celebrated International Women's Day in and around the hill station by greeting people with purple ribbon, free hugs and photo sessions.
