GURUGRAM: After a gap of nearly 20 days, doctors at the General Hospital, Civil Lines, resumed C-section surgeries on Friday as the hospital administration installed two new air conditioners at the operation theatre and one in the maternity ward.

 Other surgeries are likely to be resumed by next week, sources told TOI. 
 
 Meawnhile, a proposal has been sent by the health department for the repair of the existing air conditioning system, the administration informed. “The proposal to repair the existing system has been sent to the state health department by district health officials. Sources reveal that the repair will cost about Rs 9 lakh and budget is being sought for the same,” said Dr B K Rajora, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.
 
 A district health officer told TOI that the two new air conditioners were installed at the operation theatre as a substitute for the existing air conditioning system which is in dire need of repair for the last one year. 
 
 TOI reported on May 21 that the surgeries were put on hold in the hospital owing to the defunct air conditioning system. The doctors were compelled to either postpone the surgeries or refer the patients to government hospitals in Delhi. Among the worst hit patients were the pregnant women, who were forced to pay a hefty fee at the private hospitals.
 
 Notably, the operation theatre was set up three years ago at the hospital; however, the air conditioning system has been in a need of repair after the annual servicing last year. The hospital administration had claimed that the contractor concerned was not paying heed to their complaints.
