Anyone who wishes to apply for a   must follow a few simple steps. Even if you are a group of people, limited liability partnership, Hindu Undivided Family or so on, you can apply for the PAN by visiting the official website of   - National Securities Depository Limited (TIN - NSDL) of the   - www.tin-nsdl.com.

 In case you have lost your PAN card, you will have to first file an FIR. After which, you will have to request for reprinting your PAN by handing over your old   number and a copy of your FIR. A number of people do not wish to go through the lengthy legal process. Thus, they directly apply for a new PAN card.
 
 But please note that this can be done only if the applicant has been allotted a PAN card, which due to some reasons needs to be reprinted. In such a scenario, the   (PAN) does not change, with only a new card with other modifications (if any) provided.
