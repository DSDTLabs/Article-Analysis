LUCKNOW: Credited for party’s landslide victory in UP, state president of   Keshav Maurya is the party’s non-Yadav OBC face. Maurya also enjoys significant popularity among the cadres, besides strong connection with the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. On March 11, when BJP’s share of seats and votes increased with each round of counting, Maurya was welcomed with colours and firecrackers at the party office. 

 Born in a farmer family on May 21, 1969 in Sirathu area of Kaushambi district, Maurya obtained bachelor’s degree from Hindu Sahitya Sammelan in 1979. It is said that he sold tea and newspapers when he was a kid. As per his affidavit submitted to the election commission of India for 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he runs several businesses under the brand name of Kamdhenu. His estimated financial worth at that time was about Rs 5 crore while his wife Ramkumari Devi’s net worth was over Rs 1.3 crore. Maurya has two sons Yogesh and Ashish. 
 
 Though he acquired discipline of the RSS, his career started with consecutive defeats in 2002 and 2007 assembly elections. In 2014, he rode the Modi wave and became MP from Phulpur, which had been a stronghold of the Nehru-Gandhi family since Independence. 
 
 Sources said Maurya suited the Hindutva agenda because of his RSS connection. He was also close to party’s national president  . Party spokesperson Mohsin Raza said, “He was a choice for CM but senior leadership has its way of looking at things and its decision is welcome to all of us.”
