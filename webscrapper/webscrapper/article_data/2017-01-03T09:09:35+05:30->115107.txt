LUCKNOW: BSP chief   had foreseen that   would emerge stronger after crushing  's brother  , said  , on the basis of observations she made of the Yadav family feud. 

 Political observers said that soon after Akhilesh and Shivpal engaged in an open show of acrimony at SP office on October 25, Mayawati appeared "sympathetic" towards Shivpal when she accused the SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav of being driven by 'Putra Moh' (love of his son, UP CM Akhilesh Yadav) and making his younger brother the scapegoat in the family crisis. On November 4 too, when Akhilesh embarked on his 'rath yatra', Mayawati made two observations that hinted at her strategy of denting the SP. She said categorically that the recent ruckus by SP leaders inside the CM's official residence reminded her of the guest house incident in 1995 in which she was attacked following her decision to withdraw support from the SP.
 
 She also cited the October 24 incident in which SP MLC Ashu Malik had accused SP MLA and minister in Akhilesh's cabinet Pawan Pandey (who was later sacked from the party) of beating him inside CM's residence. Malik is close to Shivpal, while Pandey is one of the key members of Team Akhilesh. "In a way, Mayawati sympathised with the person close to Shivpal,'' said a political expert. Mayawati accused Akhilesh of being like his father in beating opponents through "violence". She also took on Akhilesh's rath yatra, saying those present were the same who created ruckus not only outside SP chief'shouse but also inside the CM's official residence.
