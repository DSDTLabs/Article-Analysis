CHENNAI: Ending uncertainty and suspense on his party's stand,   vice-president   has directed eight TN   MLAs to vote against the   government during the trust vote in the Tamil Nadu assembly on Saturday. 

 This was officially communicated to   president S Thirunavukkarasar late evening. Earlier in the evening, Thirunavukkarasar, who met with his MLAs at the party headquarters in Chennai, told reporters that the high command would take a decision later. 
 
 “We will meet again at 9am on Saturday morning and taking a final decision,“ Thirunavukkarasar told reporters, denying tweets credited to him that the party had decided to vote against the Palaniswami government.
 
 A section in the party had accused the PCC leader of taking a pro-Sasikala stand because of his AIADMK past.
