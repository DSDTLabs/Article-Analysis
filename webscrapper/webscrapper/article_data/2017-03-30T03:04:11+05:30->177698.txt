NEW DELHI: The   high court on Wednesday dismissed a   filed by   for a common   in the upcoming municipal elections.

 Justice Hima Kohli found merit in the stand of the state election commission that the EVMs would be carrying photographs of candidates and the party wouldn’t have any disadvantage without a common symbol.
 
  added that since the plea was filed after the polling process was underway; it was “very late in the day for the court to interfere.”
 
 “Such is the unique and unparalleled beauty of the clockwork mechanism fine-tuned by the ECI at the national and State levels that over the years they have not failed to live up to the aspirations of the citizen for conducting smooth, free and fair elections on time,” the court observed while referring to the delay by the party in moving court.
 
 Rejecting the plea of Swaraj India challenging the state EC’s rules, the court noted that, “In their quest for perfecting the franchise system in the country and discharging the onerous duty cast on them by the Constitution and the enabling provisions, the ECI and the SECs have been inventing and reinventing themselves and coming up with new measures to make the process as transparent as is possible.”
 
 Swaraj India claimed that non-allotment of a common symbol to a registered party amounted to discrimination as the Aam Aadmi Party was granted such a relief when it had contested for the first time.
 
 It wanted HC to strike down the panel’s March 14, 2017 notification and an April 2016 order which said the nominees of such parties would be treated as independent candidates for allotment of symbols.
 
 The party, registered by the Election Commission of India in February 2017, has contended that the Delhi symbols order was “wholly illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and selective, destroying the very fairness of the proposed electoral process itself.”
 
 It argued that providing it a common symbol for its candidates would create a level playing field among all the political parties, whether recognised or not, and ensure free and fair election.
