RAJKOT: It is unusual to see passengers clicking selfies with their auto-rickshaw drivers, but in Shapar village, on the outskirts of Rajkot city, such scenes are not unusual. The drivers are women in sarees who   in pink  . Meet the five ‘Pink Autowallis’ of Shapar: Sharda Solanki (52), Kanchan Makwana (38), Gauri Parmar (35), Parul Moda (23), and Rekha Jethwa (37). All operate between Shapar and Rajkot, which is a 15 km stretch. They have a separate ‘Pink Stand’ at Shapar. 

 The women have bust stereotypes and made inroads into what is still considered a male bastion. They have inspired a dozen other women who are now learning to drive an auto-rickshaw so that they can contribute financially to their families. These women are part of a pilot project initiated by Rajkot rural police and Manav Seva Mandal in December 2016. According to Rajkot rural superintendent of police Antrip Sood, the project was implemented under the Suraksha Setu programme of the police department. PSI A B Jadeja of Shapar ensures safety of the women drivers. The Rajkot rural police made the down payment of Rs 17,500 each for the auto-rickshaws. The women were given loans by a local bank for the remaining Rs 1.46 lakh. 
 
 “It is difficult for us as we face opposition from male drivers,” said Sharda, who lives in Gayatrinagar with eight family members including two sons. She earns Rs 300 to Rs 400 per day. “They harass us, use expletives, and tell us to go back home. But we are not going to take this lying down.” Parul, who is the mother of a three-month-old boy, works four hours a day. “I got the support of my husband and in-laws when I decided to drive the auto-rickshaw,” she said. “The income helps my family.” 
 
 Kanchan Makwana, a resident of Shivnagar in Shapar, had become inspiration for her 18-year-old daughter and sister-in-law, who have started learning to drive the auto-rickshaw. Children and elderly people prefer the pink option.
