VADODARA: Prime accused in the Ahmedabad serial blasts case,   alias Tauqeer, was brought to   for investigations by the Ahmedabad crime branch.   had participated in a training camp at a location near Pavagadh.

 Tauqeer whose face was covered was brought to Pavagadh in a convoy that included an armoured vehicle. A posse of policemen including police commandos were accompanying him when he was brought to the location.
 
 Sources said that the convoy reached Pavagadh-Champaner at around 12.30pm. The officers first took Tauqeer to the Khundpir Dargah. The training camp was reported set up at an isolated place near the dargah. Tauqeer was then taken to three other places that also have monuments. These include Ek Minar, the Helical Stepwell and Kabutarkhana. He was then taken to the Halol rural police station where the officials questioned him for about an hour. At around 4.30pm, the entourage left the police station along with Tauqeer.
 
 The terror training camp to plan the bomb attacks on Ahmedabad and Surat was reportedly held in January 2008. 
 
 While the choice of jungles of Pavagadh for the SIMI training camp is being considered obvious by many because the area has thick forests and a rugged terrain , many believe that there were reasons beyond this for the selection of the location. The fact that the spot is approachable easily from both Madhya Pradesh (MP) and   was also seen as another reason behind selection of the location.
