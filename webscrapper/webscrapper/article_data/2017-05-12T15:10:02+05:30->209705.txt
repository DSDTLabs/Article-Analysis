 Bareilly: After reports of cash crunch and ATMs running dry in Bareilly division for over a month now, district magistrate Pinky Jowel has taken cognizance of the situation and said that the "crisis is genuine". The DM said, "I have talked to the lead bank manager and he has assured that banks would recover from the cash crunch in a week's time and that ATMs will start dispensing cash."   Residents have been running from pillar to post to get cash as top bank officials claimed that the apex bank has not been paying heed to their repeated requests of immediate cash requirements.    The DM's assurance can be easily dismissed as tokenism as most of the banks, including the lead bank of the region, Bank of Baroda, have already raised alarm over low cash supply. "We received Rs 20 crore after several requests. We could barely manage our operations at the bank branches, leaving us in a situation where putting money in ATMs is out of question," Ghanshyam Singh, assistant general manager at Bank of Baroda, told TOI.    The cash crunch has kept both residents and bankers in a fix. "The problem was supposed to be over in 50 days after demonetisation was announced on November 8. The shutters at most ATMs have remained down for a month and there is no clarity on their opening yet," said Yasmin Khan, a city resident .    Meanwhile, top bankers in the region claimed that payment to sugarcane and wheat farmers has possibly aggravated the situation and normalcy would be restored in a week's time. "Bank branches have been making heavy payments to farmers during the harvest season. I have asked the banks to submit the status of cash flow in their respective banks following which we will take a serious look at the claims of cash crunch leading to ATMs running dry," O P Vadhera, lead bank manager told TOI.    There are more than 400 ATMs of different banks in Bareilly district, but only about 12 are functional at a time.
