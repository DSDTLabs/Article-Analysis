LUCKNOW: The one-upmanship between   and   over Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar’s legacy will be at play on the 126th birth anniversary of the dalit icon on Friday. 

 While BSP chief   will address a gathering of the party cadres at Ambedkar memorial in Lucknow, UP chief minister Adityanath Yogi will visit Ambedkar Mahasabha to pay homage to the father of the Constitution. Mayawati will visit Ambedkar memorial at 9am, while Adityanath will go to Ambedkar Mahasabha at 10am. Governor Ram Naik will accompany Yogi to the Mahasabha office, which houses Ambedkar’s ashes.
 
 The Yogi government has also chosen the day to sign the MoU for Centre’s ambitious 24x7 Power For All scheme. Yogi will sign the MoU in the presence of Union power minister Piyush Goyal. BJP’s week-long campaign to popularise the BHIM application, a digital payment gateway named after Ambedkar, will also culminate on Friday. Besides, the UP government has directed all government schools to hold sessions for students on the life of Ambedkar.
 
 BJP will organise seminars on ‘Contribution of Ambedkar to nationalism’ in all divisional headquarters. Sources said the party will also organise ‘Sahbhoj’ – community lunch with dalits - in 1,400 blocks. “We will call it ‘Samajik Samrasta Diwas’ to promote social equality,” said BJP state general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak. However, BSP leaders have slammed BJP for its attempts to usurp Ambedkar’s legacy. “BJP is responsible for the atrocities on dalits in Gujarat and Hyderabad and its ‘dalit prem’ (love for dalits) is driven by a political agenda,” said BSP state president Ram Achal Rajbhar.
