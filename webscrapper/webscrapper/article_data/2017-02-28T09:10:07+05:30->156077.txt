CHENNAI: A delegation of 12 MPs, owing allegiance to rebel AIADMK leader  , will meet President   in New Delhi on Tuesday to seek a probe into the medical treatment provided to former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and the causes that led to her death on December 5. 

 The group of MPs led by Rajya Sabha member   will also seek to nullify the floor test won by the Edappadi K   government in the Tamil Nadu assembly on February 18.
 
 Of the 12 AIADMK MPs, who are with OPS, 10 are Lok Sabha members and two Rajya Sabha members. "We have sought an appointment with the President for Tuesday. All 12 MPs are in New Delhi and we are meeting him at the Raj Bhavan at 1.30pm," Maitreyan told TOI.
 
 He said the delegation would raise the issue of medical treatment provided to Jayalalithaa while she was admitted to   and demand a probe into her death.
 
  The AIADMK MP delegation's move comes in the wake of DMK working president M K Stalin leading a team to meet the President on February 23 to seek a fresh trust vote.
 
 Meanwhile, on Monday, Panneerselvam criticised chief minister Palaniswami for not giving permission to his supporters to observe Jayalalithaa's birth anniversary in R K Nagar on February 24. 
 
 "It is only to propagate Amma's name and fame and the schemes implemented by her that we wanted to take out a rally, raising high the party flag, to various streets in her constituency. But the police, which is under the Palaniswami government, declined permission," alleged Panneerselvam.
 
 The former chief minister said any government which was against the people cannot continue and it would be defeated soon. Cadres from other parties have been joining the OPS faction.
