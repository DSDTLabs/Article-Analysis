CHENNAI: The state-sponsored memorial for legendary actor Sivaji Ganesan on the banks of the Adyar river will be inaugurated on his 89th birthday on October 1. It is not yet clear if chief minister   would inaugurate the memorial.

 Constructed by the Tamil Nadu government at Rs2.8 crore, the memorial houses a lifesize statue of the late actor that was removed from   a month ago. 
 
 The 2124sqft structure, built on a 28,000 sqft land, also houses an exhibition hall which will display 188 portraits of Sivaji Ganesan.
 
 The statue was installed near the office of the Director General of Police during the DMK rule in 2006. A public interest litigation filed in the Madras high court early this year contended that the statue was a distraction to motorists.The court ordered the removal of the statue, after which it was shifted to the memorial on   last month.
 
 Nadigar   president   suggested the government should install a touch-screen display system for visitors to view clippings from Sivaji Ganesan's films.â€œ
