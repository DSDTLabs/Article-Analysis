Gurgaon: The   on Saturday withdrew a permission to cut a tree in C Block of Sushant Lok 1.

 “As locals raised a concern over the cutting of a tree, we have withdrawn the permission. The permission was sought by an individual stating that the trees were obstructing entrance to the house. However, it was noted that the tree lies in the corner of the plot,” said a source in the department. 
 
 Environmentalist Ashok Raghav said, “Many builders are cutting down trees that have been present in front of the plots since last many years. The problem is that the forest department easily gives permission, without visiting the spot. However, we are glad that at least one tree has been saved by withdrawing the permission.”
