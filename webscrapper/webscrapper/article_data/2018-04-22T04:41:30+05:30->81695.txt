 MUMBAI: A young pariah kite which was recently rescued and later released back into the wild by an animal activist in   has forged an unusual bond with man. The kite is already popular in the neighbourhood where residents endearingly call it ‘Bayo’ which literally means ‘dear lady’ in Marathi.

 “Around a month ago, I had got a call from villagers in   in Uran that a dehydrated kite was lying on the ground and unable to fly. After informing forest officials, I started nursing the bird of prey at my house in Uran city. Within two days, the young kite had become fit and healthy, so I released it in a forested area near my house,” said the activist Rajesh Nagvekar.
 
 However, he and his family members were surprised to see that the kite had come back to their house compound just hours after being released. Hence, they gave it some food, after which the kite flew back.
 
 Nowadays,   regularly flies to my house. So, we too feed her something. Our neighbours and other local residents have also started calling the bird ‘bayo’,” said Nagvekar.
