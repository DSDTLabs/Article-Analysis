PUNE: This summer, Puneites may not have to bear the brunt of  .

 The dams that provide water to the city are more than 50% full.
 
  As the water stock available in these reservoirs is nearly double the amount during the corresponding period last year, the civic administration is not contemplating any water cuts, civic officials said. 
 
 “We have been getting regular water supply. The city has adequate water available. So there is no question of water cuts now,” the head of Pune Municipal Corporation’s water department, V  , said. 
 
 He said that there was no proposal from the irrigation department to them as of now to implement the cuts.
 
 The collective stock in the four dams that supply water to the city Panshet, Khadakwasla, Varasgaon and Temghar was recorded at 14.82TMC water on March 2. On the same day in 2016, it was 8.12TMC. This year’s quota is around 50.83%, compared to 27.84% in 2016.
 
 Irrigation officials said that as enough water is available, they have been providing water to nearby villages for agriculture since February 2. “The water is being discharged to down-stream villages at the rate of 1,392 cusecs,” an official said.
 
 The official, requesting anonymity, added, “The water is flowing via Mutha canal and is being used for irrigation in the villages alongside the canal. The discharge is helping villages till Indapur. However, it is not possible to tell as to till when it will continue.”
 
 During the last two summers, in 2015 and 2016, the city faced water cuts due to shortage in the dams. After facing water cuts for over 10 months consistently, in August 2016, there was some relief as the general body of the   passed a resolution to cancel the water cuts. 
 
 From getting water supply every alternate day, Pune then began to get water once a day. It was then regularised in January.
