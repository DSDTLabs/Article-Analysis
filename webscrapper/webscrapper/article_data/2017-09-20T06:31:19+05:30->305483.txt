 The corporation informed the union of its decision in a letter dated September 9, 2017. Even in the past, BMRC had told the union that its members didn't come under the   and were not drawing salaries less than Rs 10,000.
 
 The management's decision not has angered employees, who fear that a decision on their demands which has been pending for over two months may be further delayed. “We had submitted a charter of 29 demands to the management and the labour department along with a plea to recognize the union.Now, the management has refused to do so for reasons which are baseless,“ said Suryanarayana Murthy, head of the union.
 
 The union is also upset with what it calls dilatory tactics of the management. “I have been trying to meet the MD for over two months. He says he is ready to meet us but backs out at the last minute, either on the pretext of meetings with the government or visits to Delhi,“ he said. Calls to Kharola went unanswered.
