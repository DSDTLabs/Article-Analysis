KOLHAPUR: With the day   every day - around 37 degrees celsius on Monday - city-based doctors have asked the citizens to keep themselves hydrated, especially during outing. 

 They have also asked to avoid street products for quenching thirst as the unfiltered water may pose danger to health.
 
   , a medical practitioner from the city, said, "The increased temperature causes dehydration and it mainly affects the elderly and children. The need to drink juices and dairy products from the street may seem an easy way to satisfy your thirst. However, it may prove dangerous if the water used is unfiltered. I would suggest use of bottled and sealed products to avoid any kind of doubts."
 
 Watave said the best thing to fight dehydration would be to add salt and lime in the regular water, which works as electrolytes for the body, just like the one in the   (ORS).
 
 He added that unless severe, in which case it is imperative to visit doctor, most dehydration cases can be treated at home. 
 
 The first thing to do is to ensure that the person gets enough fluids.
 
 Prakash Vichare, a veteran paediatrician in the city, said, "Having patients with complaints of diarrhoea is quite common during summer. People usually opt for street vendors for eating food or snacks or even drinking lemon juice or other products. Keeping a check on vendors is a tedious task. Keeping your body filled with fluids is necessary. However, it should not be compromised with quality and hygiene."
 
 He advised the citizens to avoid eating cold and sour food products during this season, as it may pose various health related issues.
 
 Another medical practitioner advised that if an individual is going to spend the day outdoors, ensure that he/she carries water with them. "One should avoid excessive alcohol intake since alcohol hikes water loss and lowers ability to realize that body is getting dehydrated," he said.
