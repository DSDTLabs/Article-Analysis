 TOI had reported that MP school education minister Vijay Shah floated this idea in September last year. “Etching martyrs’ names in history will be a great honour to their families. With schools named after them, martyrs will be remembered forever. It will also inspire children to work for the country,” the minister said.
 
 His department is preparing a list of names to be given to government schools. Officials said martyrs from all over the country, not just MP, will be honoured. This includes legends of the 1971 India-Pakistan and 1999 Kargil wars. Gwalior, Bhind and Morena districts, in particular, have a strong martial history. Half a dozen security forces personnel from these districts have been killed in Maoist attacks and on the LoC in the last month or so.

 Move to instil patriotism in schoolchildren
 
 Principal secretary of school education, Deepti Gaur Mukherji said, “Besides renaming schools, we are also putting up pictures of martyrs in schools. Home ministry has written to us saying that not only Army jawans, but those from CRPF and BSF must be included. We are now trying to see how to work it out. The project is already in process.”
 
 Schoolchildren will be given information on the lives of martyrs. “The aim is to instil patriotism among schoolchildren and to honour martyrs,” she told TOI.
 
 At a meeting with school education officials, Shah said that with this project, coming generations will know of the sacrifices men in uniform have made for the country. He has told officials to prepare portraits to be displayed on the main gates of schools. During birth anniversaries of martyrs, schools will hold special prayers and lectures on them.
