PATNA: The state   has accused the Chiraiya police outpost (OP) in Salkhua circle of Saharsa district of supporting antisocial elements in uprooting 150 Mahadalit families from the government land near the OP. It has sought immediate action against the guilty police personnel. The incident occurred late Thursday night.

 CPI state secretariat member   Kumar on Friday submitted a report on the incident to both CM   and DGP P K Thakur. Pointing to the flagrant violation of all norms, the party has noted that the police personnel remained silent spectators when the antisocial elements resorted to violence on the Mahadalit families concerned to uproot them from the government land on which they had been living for a long time.
 
 Ram Babu said the antisocial elements not only destroyed their hamlets, but also torched them, apart from looting their belongings and manhandling the women. Moreover, they got the land ploughed with a tractor, after which seeds of cattle fodder grass were sowed on it, he said, adding the Chiraiya OP police personnel stood as mute spectators.
 
 According to Ram Babu, Saharsa district CPI secretary Om Prakash Narayan, who is also a zila parishad member, had met the Salkhua CO on December 24 and requested him to provide ‘vasgeet parcha’ (homestead land occupation/possession document) to the 150 Mahadalit families concerned. Curiously, the CO had assured him to provide them the required documents.
 
 Given the backdrop, Ram Babu demanded action against the guilty police personnel for dereliction of duty and steps to get the uprooted families settled on the land. He also demanded levelling of the land under MNREGA scheme and houses for them under PM Awas Yojana.
