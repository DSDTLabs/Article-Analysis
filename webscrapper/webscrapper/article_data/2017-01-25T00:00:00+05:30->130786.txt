It has generated a lot of curiosity and it was but natural that the film on mystic poet saint   was screened at the Dharwad Sahitya Sambhrama. The film, titled Allamma, has been made by TS   and stars   in the lead. Given how Allama’s life and journey holds extra significance to  , the film was screened at this festival. The makers and team discussed the film and the characters. When they were questioned about showing Allama as a man sporting six-pack, Nagabharana argued, “Allama was yoga practicener, which we have shown through the character's fit body. There was no other commercial intention.” 
Nagabharana also stressed on how  , being the epicentre of the North Karnataka region, can encourage film talent if promoted as a film hub. “The government has to announce a film city in the budget here and this can be done only if the regional MPs put the necessary pressure. This region has grown and a film city will only increase employment and opportunities among the youth,” he added, saying that the authorities pushing for the same should look at the   as an available model to replicate.
