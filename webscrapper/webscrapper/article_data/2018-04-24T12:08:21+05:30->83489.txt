HYDERABAD: After crippling repeat offenders with the Preventive Detention (PD) Act, city police have now decided to invoke it against receivers of stolen property. If booked under the PD Act, the culprit will not get bail for a year. 

 After the arrest of two notorious snatchers and recovery of 80 tola stolen gold,   police commissioner V C Sajjanar on Monday sent a stern warning to stolen property purchasers (receivers) by saying that they would invoke the PD Act against the person who was repeatedly aiding the duo by disposing of the gold.
 
 Police had arrested Amol Kolekar, a goldsmith from   for disposing of stolen gold ornaments from chain-snatchers Sk   and  . After the arrest, Cyberabad police chief Sajjanar said they would initiate proceedings to detain   under the PD Act, effectively keeping him in prison for a year without bail.
 
 Police had earlier warned goldsmiths and jewellers, who have a record of purchasing stolen gold, to mend their ways. "Those who are repeatedly involved in disposal of stolen gold items will also be booked under the PD Act," the Cyberabad commissioner told TOI. 
 
 Kolekar used to melt the stolen gold at his workshop. "He turns the jewellery into gold bars and sells them to jewellers for good price. If Saleem and Afroz had to directly dispose of the stolen items to jewellers, they would only get 15,000 per tola, but Kolekar gives them 22,000 per tola," an investigating official said. 
 
 With money flowing in steadily from Kolekar, Saleem's gang committed one offence every week since September 2017. Saleem's wife, who is a beautician, used to frequent high-end pubs and he also led a lavish life. Police will crack the whip against receivers to rein in habitual offenders.
