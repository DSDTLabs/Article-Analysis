JAIPUR: Doctors at the   were surprised to see an infant born with absence of all distal limb portions. Congenital amputation syndrome affecting all four limbs is a rare anomaly.

 The infant is healthy and he is likely to be discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. According to doctors, it is an uncommon congenital deformity characterized by the absence of one or more distal limb portions.
 
 “This deformity is caused mainly by genetic factors, but some   (or environmental) factors have been identified, such as the use of thalidomide for morning-sickness,” Dr  , paediatrician, government hospital Phulera, said.
 
 He said that they have collected history of the family to find out any specific reason of the congenital amputation syndrome. “In this case, the mother had recurrent episodes of allergic rhinitis and asthma and was prescribed fluticasone nasal spray and intermittent inhalation therapy. Her elder sister was affected from polio in childhood with residual deformity. Antenatal history regarding radiation exposure, febrile illness and rash were negative.   were negative too. The antenatal ultrasound was done in all three trimesters and revealed no obvious anomaly,” Dr Bagri said.
 
 Dr Bagri said mother of the baby conceived after active married life of nine months and there is no history of any abortion or abortifacient drug use; neither any drug used for conception. She was tested negative for HIV and VDRL. Her BP was normal throughout pregnancy and no radiation exposure could be documented or reported.
 
 Although She was anaemic, but her other tests were normal. Sonography for foetal well-being was conducted three times but no deformity was reported, Dr Bagri said.
 
 In this case, doctors suggest that use of prosthesis and training of parents and child may serve as an important management plans. Upper-limb prosthesis should be designed to serve as many needs as possible so that number of devices is kept to a minimum.
