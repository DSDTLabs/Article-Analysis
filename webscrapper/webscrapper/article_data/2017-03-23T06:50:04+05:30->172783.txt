PUNE: Two women lost  , together worth Rs 1.2 lakh, in separate incidents in Yerawada and Sangvi, believing in conmen’s offer of polishing their jewelleries.

 When a 42-year-old woman was alone at her home in Yerawada on Monday, two unidentified men came and offered to polish her gold and silver ornaments at a cheap rate. The suspects won the woman’s confidence polishing few copper utensils. Then they told her to give gold ornaments for polishing, said sub-inspector Arun Gaud of the Yerawada police station.
 
 He said the duo told the woman to fill a pan with water and put it on the gas burner. The suspects then mixed some powder in the water and pretended to keep the ornaments in the pan. “The duo told the woman to check the pan after some time and left the house,” Gaud said.
 
 When the woman checked the pan, she did not find her ear rings and two gold chains, worth Rs 61,500, inside it. “We have registered the offence under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC,” Gaud said.
 
 A similar case happened in Sangvi on Monday. Using the same modus, two men made away with gold ornaments worth Rs 60,000 of a 50-year-old woman. The Sangvi police are probing the case.
 
 On March 10, a 54-year-old woman from   had fallen prey to the same trick of two conmen. The woman lost gold ornaments worth Rs 33,000.
 
 An officer from the crime branch said the gang had been active in the city for the past two months. In February, a 64-year-old woman from Warje was duped of her gold ornaments worth Rs83,000. “We suspect the involvement of the same gang in all the cases,” said the officer.
