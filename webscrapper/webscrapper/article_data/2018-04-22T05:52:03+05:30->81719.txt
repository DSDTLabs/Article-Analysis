KOLKATA: The body of a woman was found inside a sack in the   on Saturday. The police said they have registered a case of unnatural death.

 According to police, around 10.30am locals found the sack with the woman — aged between 25-30 — dressed in a salwar kameez.
 
 “So far, it seems that the death took place at least 48 to 72 hours ago. The tongue was protruding and murder cannot be ruled out. Since rigor mortis has set in, it is difficult to ascertain if the body carried any external injuries. We have sent the body for post-mortem to ascertain how and when death occurred,” said  , DC (Headquarters).
 
 Locals said they found a plastic bag floating in the canal, out of which a portion of acloth could be seen hanging out. They immediately alerted cops.
 
 The police said they were now checking all the adjoining police stations for leads. “We have sought help from Kolkata Police and North 24 Parganas police, besides our own commissionerate to establish the identity of the woman. We are investigating the case from all possible angles,” said an officer.
