HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar   on Thursday announced that he would soon embark on a tour of all 119 Assembly constituencies in the state.

 The Assembly and   polls are a year and a half away and the TRS leader’s announcement has signalled his decision to reach out to the masses.
 
 Speaking at a programme in   in Medak district on Wednesday,   said he had been busy with ‘desh seva’ (nation’s service) and could not visit Toopran. “But when I was informed that the 50-bedded hospital is ready, I thought it was an opportunity to meet all of you,” he said. The CM, who inaugurated the hospital, also announced that a community hall would be constructed in Toopran.
 
 “A community hall will be constructed not just in Toopran but in all mandal headquarters at a cost of ₹1 crore each,” he said.
 It was towards the end of his speech the CM explained his intentions of beginning of tour of all constituencies.
 
 
 “Let anyone think whatever they want to think. I will begin my tour in a few days,” he declared.
 
 Interestingly, the TRS had also written to the   (ECI) to allow it to appoint presidents constituency-wise instead of district-wise. However, the ECI rules did not permit that.
 
 The CM has begun his constituency-wise tour as he also went to Gajwel, his own assembly constituency on Thursday. He inspected works pertaining to the construction of a 100-bedded hospital and also 2 bedroom houses. MRPS activists tried to obstruct the CM’s convoy at   village. Because of the disruption, the CM cancelled his address and interaction there.
