MUMBAI: Looking at a sordid tale of abduction and continuous rape of a 12-year-old girl, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court has refused to grant bail to a 35-year-old Malad man arrested almost a year ago. 

 The wife of the accused had alerted the child's parents after he returned home with the girl in July 2017, a month after he first kidnapped her and took her to Rajasthan. The complaint was lodged by the child's father. He told the police that on June 6 last year, his wife, who does catering, took their daughter along to a pooja gathering. He said his wife left the child at the hall and went to watch the pooja. When she returned, the child wasn't there. The father said that after a frantic search, they went to the police and lodged a complaint.
 
 The child was rescued on July 7. She told the police the accused had forcibly taken her away from her mother's workplace in an autorickshaw, and when she screamed for help, he clamped her mouth shut and threatened to kill her. The girl said the accused later took her on a bus and she eventually realised she was in Sagwad, Rajasthan.
 
 In his bail plea, the accused denied the allegations and claimed the child left with him voluntarily. He said that on many occasions, the victim had an opportunity to raise an alarm, but she did not. The accused submitted that this showed she had consented to develop a physical relationship with him. He claimed that a false case had been filed as he had a dispute with the child's mother.
 
 Rejecting his bail plea, the court said that if he was granted relief, he may put pressure on the girl and tamper with evidence as the girl, the accused and prosecution witnesses are residents of the same locality. 
 
 "Considering prima facie involvement of the accused in the heinous crime, committed upon a girl of 12 years, I do not find this to be a fit case for consideration of bail at this juncture," the court observed.
