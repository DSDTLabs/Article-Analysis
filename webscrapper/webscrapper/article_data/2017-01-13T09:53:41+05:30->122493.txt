MUMBAI: In what came across as a final nail in the coffin of an already lifeless Indian cricket administration, the  , on Thursday, posted Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on their website, clarifying queries that were being asked post the January 2-3 order of the Supreme Court.

 It came a day after the committee members had met in New Delhi on Wednesday where the meeting is learned to have lasted four hours.
 
 The FAQs spell out very clearly that "in keeping with the spirit of the hon'ble SC's judgment, a disqualified office-bearer is no longer to be associated with cricket administration.
 
 "He/she is disqualified from being a representative or nominee of the member association or the   and cannot discharge any other role in or on behalf of the association or the BCCI. He/she cannot function within the association in any patron or advisory capacity nor be a member of a committee or council." This would mean that none of the ineligible office bearers of the BCCI or state associations can be nominated for any meeting of the Board or even the International Cricket Council in any capacity. The   (MCA) had nominated the name of   ­ ex-secretary of the BCCI and ex-president of the MCA to represent the association in BCCI. He is now ineligible for the same.
 
 Meanwhile, the FAQs now put former India captain and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president   ­ whose name had wrongly begun to do the rounds as potential president of the BCCI ­ out of the equation too under the cooling-off clause.
 
 The panel has also tried to deal with a possible scenario where the state associations may use proxies to take over the administration when elections happen.
