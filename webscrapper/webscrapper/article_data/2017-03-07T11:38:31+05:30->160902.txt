JAIPUR: There is nothing to substantiate claims about radiation from cellphone towers being cancerous, said health minister Kalicharan Saraf on Monday.

 In a reply to the concern raised by Congress   Sukhram Vishnoi about rise in number of cancer patients, Saraf said that the   (WHO) had said that there is no relation between radiation from these towers and cancer. The subject has been studied at length and over 25,000 papers related to the subject, have said that there is no connection between the two. A committee of doctors from the   (AIIMS) and other experts have also said that there is no evidence to prove that radiation from mobile phone towers causes cancer,” the minister said, when Vishnoi claimed that the mobile towers were one of the reasons behind rise in number of cancer patients.
 
 Vishnoi had also listed out consumption of tobacco and toxins present in polluted water as major reasons for spread of cancer. “There were 10 lakh cancer patients in 2010, there are 14 lakh in 2017. By 2021, it is estimated that 7 crore people in India would be suffering from cancer,” he had said, while raising the issue during the question hour. He claimed that while crores had been spent on treatment plants, most were not functioning at present. He demanded that the state government should take appropriate measures.
 
 Since the urban development and housing department (UDH) issues permission for setting up mobile towers, UDH minister Srichand Kriplani, also chose to reply and blamed   for not framing a proper policy for installation of mobile towers. “Congress had issued directives only for divisional headquarters; we recently brought in a policy which addresses the issue for the towns as well,” he said. Kriplani added that as per the new policy, mobile towers could not be installed within t500 meters periphery of schools, hospitals, play grounds and jails,” he added.
