The Allahabad high court has issued notices to several authorities including the Union health ministry,   and   on a public interest petition seeking directions to prevent the practice of unnecessary stenting by bringing in medical auditing of all catheterisations labs (cath labs) in India. 

  Referring to news items and published studies both in India and abroad regarding the "highly condemnable practice of implanting unnecessary stents", advocate   had filed a petition seeking the court's intervention to protect patients and to bring in greater regulation of the health sector. 
 
  The division bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   on Monday gave petitioners leave to add Cardiological Society of India, Indian Medical Association and Association of Health Care Providers (India) as respondents and asked them to file a reply by May 15. 
 
  The petition maintained that the practice of giving kickbacks to doctors in return for purchase of stents was one of the major causes for implanting unnecessary stents. The petition referred to a ruling of the   where it recommended the government take steps to enforce the right to information by forcing private hospitals to give medical records of patients on a daily basis to prevent any alteration in them.
