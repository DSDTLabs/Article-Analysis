PATNA: The state education department has issued show-cause notices to six district magistrates, three district programme officers (DPOs) and four district programme coordinators (DPCs) for not attending a meeting convened by chief secretary   at Adhiveshan Bhawan here on September 22.

 DMs of Nalanda, Vaishali, Siwan, Madhubani, Araria and Kishanganj had skipped the meeting, which was held to discuss preparedness for the launch of the state government’s drive against social evils, such as dowry and child marriage. Apart from the drive against social evils, the government will also launch ‘Bapu Aaapke Dwar’ and ‘Gandhi Katha Vachan’ programmes on October 2 to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 
 
 “Some of the government officials had skipped the meeting without giving any proper reason. Their act amounted to indiscipline. The erring officials have been given one-week time to justify their absence at the meeting. If they fail to come up with valid reasons, action will be taken against them,” education department secretary Robert L Chongthu said. 
 
 The DPOs who failed to attend the meeting were from Bhojpur, Saharsa and Muzaffarpur. The DPCs of Buxar, Aurangabad, Begusarai and Madhepura had also skipped the meeting.
