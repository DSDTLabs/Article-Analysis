BATHINDA: Activists of ruling   allegedly assaulted two labourers working for the forest department for asking the   MP Balwinder Singh Bhunder about alleged embezzlement of the   at   assembly segment of Mansa on Monday. After allegedly beating labourers Raja Singh and Jalaan Singh, the Akalis handed them over to police.

 Bhunder had gone to the   on Monday to distribute grants to the village. His son Dilraj Singh is SAD candidate from Sardulgarh assembly constituency. He alleged that the labourers were drunk and misbehaving with them.
 
 According to eyewitnesses, Bhunder was presiding over the programme in the school. Raja and Jalaan had asked Bhunder what the authorities were doing in unearthing alleged embezzlement running into lakhs in the forest department. Following that, Akali workers sitting near Bhunder started beating them and handed them over to police who took them to Kot Dharmu police station. Other labourers staged a sit-in outside the police station for the release of Raja and Jalaan.
 
 Forest department labourers union president Ghukka Singh and Mansa district unit secretary of CPI (M) Kulwinder Singh said, “Power drunk Akalis beat up labourers just for asking Bhunder about embezzlement. It is intolerable and we want that they should be released and action should be taken against those who beat up the labourers.”
 
 When contacted, Bhunder said, “I have no idea about any embezzlement in the forest department funds that they were talking about. No Akali worker beat them.”
 
 Mansa senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mukhwinder Singh said, “Police took both labourers into preventive custody. When they were medically examined, both were found to have consumed alcohol. No case has been registered as they have apologized and wanted to reach a compromise. As per initial investigations no one thrashed the labourers and only an altercation took place in the presence of MP Bhunder.”
