JAIPUR: In a train journey a train conductor (TC) and train ticket examiner (TTE) remain in public dealing and are oftenly criticised and appreciated for their efforts, however loco pilot (driver) and his efforts remain unnoticed. It was a different experience for  , loco pilot (driver) and  , co loco pilot who were nothing less than a celebrity while they were felicitated by  , newly appointed GM of north western railways (NWR).

 Makhan Lal and Rakesh are posted at Bandikui section of Jaipur division of north western railways (NWR) and were unaware that their effort could bring laurels to them. Both were given a cash award of Rs 5000 along with an appreciation letter by Singh. As they will board Amritsar-Ajmer train from Rewari as their duty on Wednesday as loco pilots they were pumped up to keep up good work. “We were on Hisaar-Jaipur fast passenger Sunday when we saw iron rods and boulders lying on the railway tracks. Since we spotted them at an adequate distance while the train was moving towards   railway station, we released the pressure and applied brakes to avoid and avert any derailment,” recalled Makhan Lal while talking to TOI after his appreciation.
 
 Makhan Lal and Rakesh had a sigh of relief that train which was moving on a speed of almost 70 kms/hour stopped much before the place where the boulders and iron rods were lying. “We removed the boulders and also intimated the control room,” said Rakesh.
 
 Both of them were looking relaxed yet satisfied while they found media persons and their senior officers knowing about their effort. Appreciating their effort, Singh, said, “I think such things need to be encouraged. They have done a splendid job by using their intelligence and presence of mind.”
