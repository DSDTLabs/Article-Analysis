Mumbai: Leading alloy producer   has raised $1.3 billion (about Rs 8,400 crore) through bonds from foreign investors to refinance debt on its international balance sheet. It raised $300 million through five-year papers at 4.45%, and another $1 billion through 10-year papers at 5.45%.

 As of September 2017, Tata Steel had a debt of over Rs 90,250 crore. The steel maker used its Singapore arm Abja Investment for the fund-raising programme. Against its requirement of $1.3 billion, the company’s bond issue generated a book size of more than $7 billion, which helped it to lower the rate of interest offered in the two types of bonds. The bonds will be listed on the Singapore exchange.
 
 Tata Steel’s fund-raise from the overseas debt market reflects the growing trend among Indian companies’ preference for dollar bond issuances as they cash in on bullish investor sentiment and low borrowing costs. In the recent past, ICICI Bank and RIL raised $500 million and $800 million, respectively, through bonds from foreign investors.
 
 The $1.3-billion borrowing marks Tata Steel’s return to the overseas debt market since mid-2016. The company said that the proceeds from the sale of bonds will be used to refinance its offshore obligations, which will help de-risk its balance sheet as well as enhance financial flexibility. Tata Steel, after selling some of its loss-making assets in the UK and announcing a merger of its European business with Thyssenkrupp, has increased its focus on the home market where demand for the alloy is expected to almost triple by the end of the next decade. Besides the $1.3-billion bond issue, the company is also raising Rs 12,800 crore ($2 billion) through a domestic rights offer to finance its capacity expansion and pare debt. The company is raising capacity by 5 million tonnes per annum at its Kalinganagar plant, which currently has a capacity of 13 million tonnes.
