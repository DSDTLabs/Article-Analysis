Madurai: As the demand for cold-pressed oil goes up, a technician from Melur in Madurai who has been making wooden oil extractors has become much sought-after by traders. S Senthil, a technician known for experimenting with agricultural implements, says some people approached him for making oil extractors from wood and he decided to give it a try.

 ``Sourcing the Vagai (Indian Siris) wood is a problem and has to be obtained from places like Manamadurai. It takes about a month to make a single extractor fitted with a 3HP motor as it utilises very low power, stand etc. It costs between Rs one and three lakh based on the size,’’ he said. The man has supplied as many as 60 machines in the last one-and-a-half years. 
 
 A farmer from Therku Theru near Melur in Madurai, S  , who completed his civil engineering at   more than three decades ago, says that he has been trying to promote cold-pressed oil so that the farmer would benefit, but sourcing raw materials was a problem. This is because sesame is a rainfed crop and with the monsoon failing for the past five years, farmers have not been able to produce sufficient yield. Coconut plantations are being destroyed due to drought and copra is so expensive that a kilogram of coconut oil costs Rs 380. Jaggery, an important ingredient in production of gingelly oil, is becoming very expensive as the government is not promoting the cultivation of palm trees.
 
 Cold pressed or oil produced in rotary machines that have 16 rotations per minute will retain most of the nutrients and minerals and will be far better than refined oil, he said. ``There are also people who are against these cold-pressed oil who claim that they contain the chemicals used in cultivation. Hence they say that it is also not free of chemicals as is being claimed. However, that stands true for   too which use the same seeds. In fact, they use more chemicals to `refine’ the oil and deprive it of all its nutrients,’’ he added.
