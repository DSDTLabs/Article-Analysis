LUDHIANA: A local court has sentenced four persons, including three women, to 10-year rigorous imprisonment in a   case.

 The court of additional sessions judge Rajeev K Beri also imposed a fine of Rs one lakh each on the convicts –– Ishar Ram, Mukhtiaro alias Soma, Billo and Mukhtiaro alias Hathiaro alias Seeto –– and they will have to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a year if they fail to pay the fine.
 
 Two peddlers –– Jeeto alias Bhajna and Sarabjit Malha –– have been declared proclaimed offenders.   and  , two other accused in the case, were acquitted of charges.
 
 On September 15, 2012, Sadar   police had booked Mukhtiaro, Billo, Seeto, Jeeto, Ishar Ram and others under Section 22 of the   Act, fraud and other sections of the IPC after they were found carrying 1.2 kg psychotropic powder in their car near Khanna.
 
 The convicts had prayed that they are first-time offenders and are lone bread earners of their respective families so lenient view may be taken against them while deciding question of sentence.
 
 But the court said, “There is no evidence that convicts are not first offenders. The nature of offence and heavy recovery of intoxicating powder, which is commercial in nature, do not leave any reason with the court to treat these convicts with leniency lest it may give wrong signal to the society thereby encouraging propagation of delivery and possession of such psychotropic substances which are hazardous, damaging and are potential reason for spoiling of youth.”
