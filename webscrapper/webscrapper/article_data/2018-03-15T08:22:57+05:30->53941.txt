NEW DELHI: A trained wrestler grounded in Chambal’s rough ways,   always surprised with his flexibility, more a gymnast’s trait. He never made irreconcilable foes.

 
 His son and successor  , who wrested the party from   a year ago, proved on Wednesday he is a step ahead of his father.
 
 With victories in saffron bastions of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the CM’s and deputy CM’s seats, the Yadav neta established that not only has SP not lost its resilience but has managed the near-impossible — an alliance with BSP. This may well have happened on the belated realisation that his gamble with   in the UP polls was a bad idea.
 
 The newfound alliance promises to bring the curtain down on the bitterness sparked by the ‘state guesthouse incident’ on Mulayam’s watch in 1995 — an assault on BSP chief Mayawati by   goons. The chasm was too wide to bridge, and personalised UP’s political rivalry on the lines of Tamil Nadu’s Karunanidhi vs Jayalalithaa.
 
 The Dalit and Yadav outfits did, however, join hands in the wake of the Babri Masjid demolition to quell communal polarisation that eventually led to the rise of BJP. For years post-1995, BSP toed the line with BJP while Mulayam kept unofficial lines open with saffron netas in the state and at the Centre. That the two sworn foes could patch up was never thought feasible, and that helped Congress play one against the other to secure support from both in UPA, while BJP benefited from a division of votes to sweep multi-polar contests in 2014 and 2017.
 
 But within a year of Akhilesh displacing Mulayam, Mayawati surprised all by announcing support for her arch rival on the eve of the bypolls. The alliance may well have been forced by the existential threat to SP and BSP by BJP, but events may not have taken this turn under Mulayam.
 
 The big question is will the alliance survive? The SP-BSP combo could return UP to bipolarity, not a comfortable idea for the saffrons. The results threaten to put UP back in the contest.
