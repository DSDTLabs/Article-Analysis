GUWAHATI: Former chief minister   on Wednesday said more and more youths from the state are joining  . 

 Talking to reporters on Wednesday, Gogoi said the   government at the Centre lacks political will to sort out this problem. "If they (BJP government) are not going to talk to the separatists, how could they bring them to the negotiation table? Earlier, our government had initiated talks with everybody. But the situation is deteriorating because of lack of political insight of the present government," Gogoi told reporters here on Wednesday. Expressing concern over the present scenario, he added, "Today, the situation is deteriorating with more youths joining Ulfa. Jihadi activities are also on the rise...We are concerned about it."
 
 He said, "Though the Centre has been claiming that demonetization has curbed insurgency, it is on the rise. There is no clear cut policy and they (BJP government) don't know how to deal with the situation. The situation was much better during the regime of UPA. It's fast deteriorating now." 
 
 He added that he is going to write a book on how to deal with militancy in  . On the Kashmir issue, Gogoi said, "It's a political problem, not just a law and order issue. This is not a military problem and has to be resolved politically. We opened the doors for Ulfa, NDFB and others though they indulged in violence. After all, they are Indian citizens. Our agenda was to keep the doors open and at the same time deal with them firmly."
