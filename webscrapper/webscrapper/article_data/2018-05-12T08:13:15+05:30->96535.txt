PUNE: The plastic ban has had a negative impact on restaurants, which have registered a drop in the number of carry parcels and home deliveries. One more sector facing a similar impact is the sweet manufacturing and selling industry. 

 
 Sweet shop operators - who have always used   and   - are in a dilemma over the course of action to be taken after the state government's deadline banning single-use plastics. Expecting a rise in input costs due to various expensive alternatives, sweet shop owners have hinted at a rise in prices of sweets, thus hitting the consumers' pockets.
 
 Speaking about the utility of plastics,   of Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale said, "Retailing of liquid-based products post the plastic ban is a problem as syrup spillage can be cumbersome for customers while taking the product home. Also, plastic increases shelf life of some products. Eliminating plastic means certain products cannot be sold for consumption beyond stores." 
 
 Chitale said, "The supply chain of biodegradable alternatives is not yet strong enough to cater to the total demand. The alternative material is prohibitively expensive than the standard packaging material. With a progressive ban, industries could have adopted alternative supply chains and switched gradually," he added. 
 
 V M Chaudhari, owner of Durga Sweets, Shivajinagar, said, "We will try to use paper as an alternative as much as possible. However, we are still unsure of how to pack farsan (a  ) and sweets like roshogulla and gulab jamun, and other sweets for customers to carry home. Even the food grade plastic containers have been banned leaving us with no clear alternative at the moment."
 
 He said, "We can use corn starch bags, containers made of wood or leaves, but they cost more than plastic bags and using these will have a direct impact on the price of sweets," he added.
