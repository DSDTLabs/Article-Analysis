GUWAHATI: The famed ' ' of   of Haridwar was performed on the   on the first evening of the   on Friday. 

 The fire form of paying salutation and offering obeisance to the mighty Brahmaputra was performed by a team of priests from the Har Ki Pauri Ghat with Sanskrit chants titled 'Brahmaputra Mahabahu' composed specifically to commemorate the sheer force and energy of the river.
 
 Altogether 27 priests from the Haridwar-based 19th century Ganga Sabha, a registered society, came down for the Brahmaputra Pranami Aarti that was performed in the same manner as it is done at Har Ki Pauri Ghat every evening. Eleven head priests from the ghat performed the fire rituals with the circling of iconic lamps invigorated with camphor, purified butter, wicks and other sacred ingredients.
 
 Purohit Nitin Shukla told TOI that just like Ganga, the Brahmaputra is equally prominent. "We are a 27-member team from Ganga Sabha and this is for the first time that such an aarti invoking the spirit of the Brahmaputra was performed at its shores. The cultural aspects of Assam are great and whether it is Ganga or the Brahmaputra, the faith that is associated with these two rivers should come within. I have never seen such a river with such a stature and magnanimity," said Shukla.
 
 The incantation invoking the Brahmaputra Pranami Aarti was specifically composed in Sanskrit by Umakanta Dev Sarma, a Sanskrit expert from Assam. The music for the incantation was composed by Pandit Avishek Sharma from Har Ki Pauri Ghat.
 
 "It was a great experience composing the music for Brahmaputra Mahabahu. It is great to be here in Assam," said Sharma.
