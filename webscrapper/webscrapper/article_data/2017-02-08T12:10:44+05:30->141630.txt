AURANGABAD: The state government on Tuesday set aside the   passed by the general body regarding promotion of assistant commissioner   as   and asked the   to clear the post. 

 Accordingly, the   (AMC) on Tuesday asked Khan to the step down with immediate effect. He will now be assistant deputy commissioner. When contacted, Khan confirmed that the state government had scrapped his post. 
 
 In June 2015, the AMC promoted Khan after seeking approval of the general body. It is important to note that Ayub Khan had become fourth deputy commissioner in the civic body. 
 
 But MIM corporator Vikas Yedke had challenged the promotion in the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay high court saying that the AMC, which falls in C category of municipal corporations could have only three posts of deputy commissioners. 
 
 The AMC has only three posts of deputy commissioners, of which, two should be appointed by the state government and one post could be occupied through promoting the municipal officials, he said. 
 
 As of now, Ravindra Nikam is occupying the post of deputy municipal commissioner (administration) - a post filled by promoting a municipal officer. 
 
 Recently, the court directed the state government and the municipal administration to decide the matter. A hearing of the matter was held between municipal authorities and other officials concerned with the state urban development department in Mumbai on January 23. 
 
 During the hearing, Yedke said the municipal administration misled the general body that there was no departmental inquiring going on against Khan. Moreover, according the normal procedure, the administration should have sought permission of the state government before elevating the officer of assistant commissioner rank to deputy commissioner. But the administration skipped the crucial procedure, he said.
