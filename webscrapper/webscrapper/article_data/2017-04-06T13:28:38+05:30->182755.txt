PANAJI: “Depression doesn’t just lead one person into darkness, it affects the entire family, neighbourhood and community. We need to start a conversation with people who have gotten themselves into a shell. Some of us express   overtly, but most of us don’t,” says Isabel de Santa Rita Vas, mentor of Mustard Seeds Art Company, which has collaborated with NGO Sangath. They have curated a celebration of World Health Day with the theme, ‘Let us be kind to our mind’.

 As part of the two-day celebration, the Mustard Seeds will be performing ‘On the Edge’, a short play written and directed by Vas. “Set in a Goan neighbourhood, the story unfolds over two days, and touches upon the lives of a bunch of simple people. It begins with the neighbourhood waking up to the sight of a man sitting on top of a bridge, silent and morose,” says Vas.
 
 Those interested in how the plot unwinds will have to find their way to Gomant Vidya Niketan, Margao, on April 7, or Sunaparanta, Altinho-Panaji, on April 8. Besides the play, the event at both venues will comprise an exhibit of photographs and artwork on the theme, documentary screenings, narratives by survivors of depression and panel discussions. The entry to these events is free and the play at both venues will begin at 7pm sharp.
 
 Many youngsters who hear and read about suicide are often heard saying that it takes courage to end one’s life, but Vas says that “it also takes courage to hold on to hope, to keep searching for that silver lining and gather strength to never give up, and instead intelligently cope with the problem”.
 
 Kiran Bhandari of the Mustard Seeds cast told  , “Those suffering from depression have their entire routines messed up, and to make things worse, they stop doing what they like. Listening to those going through depression sometimes makes them open up. We must learn to listen. We train our kids to be the best orators, but not good listeners.”
