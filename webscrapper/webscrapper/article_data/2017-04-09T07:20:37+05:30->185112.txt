AHMEDABAD: Dairy giant Amul has sued city-based   Ltd for Rs 10 crore, for infringement on its trademark rights, by naming its products after the products that Amul sells and for illegally using similar product  

 Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd and Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which markets the dairy’s products under the brand name “Amul”, filed a suit in an Ahmedabad commercial court. Amul claims that Vimal Dairy and its marketing company Shivambica Sales Corporation are guilty of passing off their products under the trademarks – Vimal Gold, Vimal Shakti, Vimal Pizza Sheese, Vimal Paneer, Vimal Shrikhand, Vimal Mast Dahi and Vimal Butter Milk.
 
 The cooperative giant complained that Vimal Dairy is infringing on its trademarks, which are legally registered – Amul Gold, Amul Shakti, Amul Pizza Cheese, Amul Paneer, Amul Shrikhand, Amul Masti Dahi and  . It contends that Vimal is “slavishly” copying the artistic works for its trademark labels. Thus Vimal Dairy has infringed Amul’s copyrights in the trademark labels, it has claimed.
 
 Amul also contends that Vimal Dairy passes off its products as those of Amul’s and as a result, the public is defrauded and deceived. Amul urged the court to permanently stop Vimal Dairy from marketing its products under names so similar to Amul’s. It claimed that Vimal Dairy has caused damage to Amul’s goodwill and reputation by passing off its own products, to the tune of Rs 10 crore.
 
 As the Anand-based dairy giant chose an   to file the suit, Vimal Dairy objected on the grounds of territorial jurisdiction of the court and challenged Amul to justify that the cause of action is the city of Ahmedabad. Amul, however, succeeded in establishing that it has chosen the right forum.
 
 Vimal Dairy later moved Gujarat high court, which recently upheld the commercial court’s conclusion that Amul can file the suit in Ahmedabad.
