GURUGRAM: The Haryana school lecturer association and Haryana school principal association met additional chief secretary for education   on Wednesday and submitted a memorandum regarding the shortage of government teachers in Gurgaon’s zone 1 that has 150 schools. 

 The Gurgaon district is divided in seven  . The shortage of teachers in zone 1 is characterised by the size the zone which is comparatively bigger than the others. 
 
 Consequently the number of teachers who have been transfered out of zone 1 is much higher than the number of teachers who were shifted to it during the online transfers in September.
 
 “Gurgaon is a peculiar case because this zone unusually has a large number of teachers compared to others. Consequently the number of teachers shifted out of the zone was more than those shifted into the zone,” said Das.
 
 In the memorandum, the teachers and the associations have requested the secretary to redraw the zones. “Regarding the transfers, the zones have not been allocated properly and that is the major cause of disproportionate number of teachers,” said  , state secretary, Haryana School Teachers Association.
 
 Meanwhile, the appointment of government teachers has been caught in the game of passing the buck between Gurgaon and Chandigarh.
 
 While the district education officials have been saying appointments have to be done at the senior level, people in the headquarters say they have already allocated power to make local arrangements.
 
 Many primary schools have been left with a skewed teacher ratio after the online   of teachers in September 2016. TOI had earlier reported that many schools in the city are without teachers despite the claims made by the government officials.
