JAIPUR: Failing to pay outstanding dues to   in New Delhi even after getting several opportunities, the petitioner in the high court on Friday sought a   on entry of defaulting former MPs Bhawar Jitendra Singh and Mahesh Joshi in government guest houses.

 The division bench of acting chief justice   was hearing a PIL by Prof KB Agarwal on recovery of guest house dues from the duo for their stay in   in New Delhi.
 
 While orally agreeing with argument of the petitioner, the high court said this is responsibility of state government not court.
 
 State advocate general   who appeared for the government said government had already proceeded under Land Revenue Act for recovery of the outstanding dues and has been served notice to attach their properties if they did not pay the dues. He said under land recovery law, respondents had to be given one month’s notice.
 
 General administration department has already initiated steps of attaching properties of two former MPs to recover outstanding dues of their stay at   house in New Delhi from 2004 to 2014.
 
 Government’s action is in compliance with the earlier order of the high court directing it to recover the outstanding dues of former MPs to state exchequer.
 
 Advocate general said property of former Union minister Jitendra Sigh has been identified and properties of Mahesh Joshi are being identified. 
 
 The petitioner had said 26 persons who were elected as MP or member of legislative assembly of Rajasthan between 2004 and 2014 have not paid dues for their stay at Rajasthan House. They have not disclosed their dues to election commission while contesting the 2014 elections either though it is mandatory. 
 
 After court’s intervention, 24 of former people’s representatives have settled their accounts while two are yet to be settled. According to government, Jitendra Singh has an outstanding due of about Rs 37 lakh while it’s Rs 8 lakh for Mahesh Joshi.
