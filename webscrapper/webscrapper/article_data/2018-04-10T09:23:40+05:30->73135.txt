LUCKNOW:   national president   is coming to UP in the most challenging time after the party came to the power in the state with an overwhelming majority last year. His primary task, say political observers, would be to restore the cohesion between the state government and the UP unit of the party. "Expect some tough measures from him," they say. 

 Shah, who has engineered BJP win in both 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when BJP and allies won 73 seats, and 2017 state elections, when the party won an overwhelming 312 seats, is visiting Lucknow when two main rivals, SP and  , are on way to forge a tie-up in the year before the big battle in 2019.
 
 Besides, Dalits - who had backed the party in both 2014 and 2017 - are showing signs of alienation and BJP's own Dalit MPs are openly expressing their resentment against discrimination. Party sources say that Shah would assess whether these 'mini'revolts by Dalit MPs were genuine or just pressure tactics. 
 
 Apart from tackling these vexing issues, Shah would also have an assessment of reasons for BJP's shocking defeats in Gorakhpur and   bypolls - especially the allegation that the organisation didn't do enough and the entire camapign had been left to CM   in Gorakhpur and Deputy CM Keshav Maurya in Phulpur.
 
 "The BJP state unit had not deputed any of office-bearers of the party to camp in the two constituencies and propagate the achievements of the Yogi government," lamented a vice-president of the state BJP, admitting that the defeat in the two bypolls has exposed the rift between the government and the organization.
 
 This is the reason the visit of Shah, known for his ruthless assessment and action, has created a ripple in the state unit.
