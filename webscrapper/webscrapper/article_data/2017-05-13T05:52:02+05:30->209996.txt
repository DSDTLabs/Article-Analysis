MEERUT: Two days after   (BSP) expelled its senior leader   and his MLA son from the party for indulging in “anti-party” activities, scores of party workers took to the city street on Friday to celebrate the move and burnt the effigy of the ousted leader. 

  The BSP workers and some people of the minority community burnt the effigy of Siddiqui at Hapur Adda Crossing, alleging that the leader “conspired” to bring down the party.
 
  Kamal Singhraj, BSP’s   chief, said, “The party members are happy after the expulsion of Siddiqui. His ouster will act as a turning point for BSP, and its graph will rise again. Siddiqui’s conspiracies were pulling the party down.”
 
 Haji Yakub Qureshi, former   minister, said, “All of us are happy that Siddiqui has been expelled from BSP, and this is for the party’s good. He never allowed leaders of the Muslim community to reach party chief  . Now, we will be able to tell our problems to the party chief without any fear.”
