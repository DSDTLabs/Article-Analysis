India’s popular IT service company,   is prepared to announce its results for the fourth quarter today, on May 02, 2018. Out of the many things to look forward to, analysts suggest, operating margin movement and traction in digital, and update on IP partnerships in the quarter are primarily to be under scanner. Apart from this, the guidance for FY19 will be very crucial.

 HCL had announced marginal raise of 0.30 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) its consolidated net profit at Rs 21.94 billion for the December 2017 quarter. Revenue rose by 3 percent QoQ and 8.4 percent YoY to Rs 128.08 billion in the fourth quarter that is under review.
 
 On a year-to-date basis, the stock has rallied around 19 percent and has underperformed the   IT index that increased around 20 percent during this period.
 Popular brokerage firm,   estimated that the company attained 3.4 percent and 2.2 percent revenue growth QoQ, respectively. The firm further predicted organic revenue to increase 1.6 percent QoQ.
 
 The revenue growth is fixed at 8-10 percent for FY19 and margin guidance is expected to be within 19.5-20.5 percent range. Edelweiss also hopes that the IT major is positioned well to post modest revenue and earnings growth due to robust order book and improving outlook in IMS business.
 
 Another brokerage company,   hopes HCL’s dollar revenue to increase 3.2 percent QoQ and 2 percent QoQ on a complementary currency (CC) basis. Growth in the quarter is observed to be based on the pick-up in IMS and a seasonal drop in IP revenue. With this, the company might have the year with dollar revenue growth of 12.6 percent, which would change into 10.8 percent constant currency growth, at the lowest 10.5-12.5 percent guidance.
 
 EBIT margin hopefully expands by 20bps to 19.8 percent because of lower allocation of cost of an intangible asset over the quarter under scanner. The firm expects 19.8 percent EBIT margin for FY18, within the 19.5- 20.5 percent guidance range.
