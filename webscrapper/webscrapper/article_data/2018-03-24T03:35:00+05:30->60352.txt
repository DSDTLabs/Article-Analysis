Margao: A private member’s bill by South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar, seeking amendment to the Constitution to include right to sanitation facilities as a fundamental right has been listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha.  The bill envisages to provide the right to adequate sanitation facilities. It seeks to ensure that the central government provides sufficient funds to the state governments, constitutes sanitation service authority at the national and state-level to oversee implementation and monitoring of the right to sanitation facilities, and constitutes permanent river authority at the national and state-level to ensure proper cleaning of inter-state rivers.  The bill envisages the creation of a special sanitation authority by local bodies at the district-level with the objective to eliminate open defecation, eradicate manual scavenging, provide modern and scientific solid waste management. “At this stage it is felt that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan be given legal backing by way of including right to sanitation facilities as a fundamental right,,” Sawaikar said, while outlining the objectives of the bill.
