LUCKNOW: The 31st annual   of the Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow will be held March 20. Chairman and group CEO, Makemytrip.com,   will be the chief guest and deliver the convocation address. Makemytrip.com is an online travel company. 

 Over 600 management students would be conferred diplomas on Monday. This includes students from PGP in management, agri business management, management for working executives, international programme in management for executives (IPMX) and the fellow programme in management. Unlike previous years, when students were given a simple diploma, this year the certificate of appreciation will have security features and a photo of the student.
