Jaipur: The allocation for education sector in the state Budget has seen a jump of 9%. The allocation for general education is Rs 26,386 crore for 2017-18 against the last year’s Rs 25,141 crore.

 Experts say that the rise of Rs 1,245 crore won’t be enough to meet all targets. The announcement of upgrading 105 schools in panchayats which neither have a private nor a government school of senior secondary level was appreciated by the experts.
 
 This decision would help in curbing dropouts in these panchayats, say experts. Upbeat over the fact that Rajasthan sends a significant number of students to IITs and medical colleges, the, government has planned to introduce science stream in 20 senior secondary schools.
 
 The Budget was silent on mid-day meal programme but it has increased the honorarium of cooks by Rs 200. The honorariums for shiksha karmis and para teachers have been increased by 10%.
 
 The newly opened state varsities in Alwar, Banswara, Sikar and Bharatpur have got a budgetary allocation of Rs 50 crore. The amount is, however, very less but experts hope that it will help these cash-strapped universities to develop some infrastructure.
 
 A new concept called ‘Crowd Sourced Social Platform’ for education has been floated for 10 colleges. This is for the first time that Rajasthan will reach out to public seeking direct contribution for opening colleges.
 
 Meanwhile, the government completely ignored the crumbling technical education department as its focus is on improving the infrastructure. A grant of Rs 7.10 crore has been given for infrastructural facilities to eight engineering colleges running under the Societies Act.
