HOWRAH: A Class VI student at an English-medium school in   was found hanging in his room at   early on Tuesday.

 The police said 12-year-old   Biswas was scolded by his parents for faring poorly in his exams. They had also prohibited him from watching cartoons and horror films on his mobile, which they blamed for his poor performance. He was told to do well in his next exams if he wanted to watch his favourite shows again.
 
 “We are shocked,” said Pritam’s father  . “His mother has gone into a shell. She refuses to believe her son is no more. He was a very obedient boy. He never defied us. We are still trying to figure out why he took such a drastic step.” An only child, Pritam usually kept to himself. He always did well in the examinations, which is why his parents were upset when his recent results showed he had not scored too well.
 
 A police officer has found out that Pritam’s love for watching cartoons and horror films on his mobile had become a distraction. “Pritam was one of the better students and always did well in examinations. But of late, his studies had taken a hit, following which his parents barred his from watching the shows on his cellphone,” said an officer.
 
 Rahul De, ACP, Howrah North, said the police were trying to verify the leads they had got. “Preliminary investigations have thrown up some leads, which we are verifying,” De said.
