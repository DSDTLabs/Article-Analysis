The upcoming film,  , directed by  , a finalist on Naalaya Iyakkunar (Season 4), has already raised eyebrows for its bold title and poster. The director admits that there have been people who have found the title (which means left hand) objectionable but adds that it is crucial to the plot of the film. 'We did think of calling it Idadhukai or even  , but they didn't have the striking quality of this title,' he says. As for the poster, which closely resembles  's PK, the debutant director reveals, 'It was a conscious decision to rip-off the poster design of PK. So as to pun on the alien aspect in PK. Here, the hero's hand acts like an alien. That is why the tagline of the film is 'Alien handed'. Plot-wise, there is no similarity between the two films,' he explains.

 The film, starring RS   and   (both of whom were seen in minor roles in  ), is a dark comedy about a left-handed pickpocket has an accident and is afflicted by a rare medical condition called the Alien Hand Syndrome. 'The coordination between the left and right hemispheres of his brain gets screwed-up, so when one part of his brain thinks like a criminal, the other acts as his conscience. And his left hand starts behaving like a different person! How he gets into troublesome situations because of this condition forms the plot,' says Ashok, who had made a 30-minute short film on this same subject.
