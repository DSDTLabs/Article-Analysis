Chennai witnessed yet another art event last weekend. As always, the turnout was good for this one as well. For these guests, everything else took a backseat and they ensured that they didnâ€™t miss this art exhibition.   Being an art expo, the guests chatted up about trends, other ongoing exhibitions in the city, etc. The artist Shirin Watwani, who showcased her works, was in the spotlight. She took time to walk the guests through her works and shared her experiences working on each of them. Our photog spotted guests like Mallika and Nishant chatting about the paintings they found impressive at the expo.
