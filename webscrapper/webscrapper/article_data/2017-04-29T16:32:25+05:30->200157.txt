VA Shrikumar's   had courted controversy when Kamal R Khan suggested in no polite terms that Prabhas, and not Mohanlal, should do the lead character of Bheeman in the movie. Following the hullabaloo,   had even been forced to comment on it and had said that he would do the part, but only if   refuses it.

 However, now it looks like Prabhas would actually be part of the epic movie. Rumours say that Prabhas has been offered a very important role in the movie and that he is likely to accept it. 
 
 Prabhas has plenty of fans all over the South, as well as in the North, especially with   2 raking in crores from the first day of its release onwards.
