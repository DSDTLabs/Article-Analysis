The pre-eminent classical   virtuoso of our time   is an international phenomenon in the field of percussion and in the   world at large. He is one of the world’s most esteemed and influential musicians and widely considered a chief architect of the contemporary world music movement. Now, he has been presented with a lifetime achievement award by  's  . 
For the maestro, who is the scion of North Indian music’s greatest percussion dynasty, the move from Mumbai to Marin County, California, in the early 1970s opened up vast new musical realms for exploration, and no relationship has played a more essential role in his journey than SFJazz.
 He credits SFJazz founder Randall Kline with providing a conceptual framework “that made it possible to discover things that I could be a part of seamlessly, and still maintain my identity,” says Hussain and adds. “That’s why the relationship has blossomed into one of the greatest sources of learning for me. It’s allowed people to look at me in a different light, as not only a classical Indian tabla player but a percussionist at large. I am really humbled by the honour.” On January 18, the SFJAZZ Center was filled with cultural and political leaders, celebrities, artists, and music enthusiasts to present Hussain with the SFJAZZ Lifetime Achievement Award and celebrate their 5th Anniversary Season.
