PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s ongoing survey of mapping properties across the city is expected to be completed by the end of next month. 

 
  
 The survey is being carried out to assess property tax revenue. The administration has appointed two agencies to conduct the house-to-house survey. About 78% of the work has been completed so far. A deadline of June 30 has been set to complete the survey. The administration has appealed to citizens to cooperate with the surveyors by providing the required details.
 
 Property tax department officials said there are about 8.45 lakh registered properties in the city of which details of 6.55 lakh properties have been collected. Of the two agencies, one has completed the survey of 83% properties, while the other has reached the 55% mark.
 
 The survey was stopped for almost three months after some elected representatives raised objections. The civic administration had received suggestions to appoint new agencies for the remaining survey work. However, the administration decided not to appoint new agencies. 
 
 Officials said the agencies had restarted their work and an extension was given up to June 30, 2018, because of the recent stoppage of work. They have been told to expedite the work and complete it within the given deadline. 
 
 Sources in the administration said though property tax is the civic body’s key source of revenue, with an average annual tax collection of over Rs 1,000 crore, the civic body has been facing a tough challenge to recover property tax dues. The information received through the survey will prove crucial in boosting property tax collection.
