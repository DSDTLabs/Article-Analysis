JAIPUR: One ‘Royal’ will not hide behind excuses after yet another moral-crushing defeat, and that is  . The   mentor took to Twitter to vent his frustration after the Royals surrendered rather tamely for the second time in as many matches. In fact, all their three defeats so far have been by big margins, something that will surely trouble the management.

 
 
 
 Although most would prefer to put up a brave front, Warne isn’t one to do that.
 
 
 
 “Apologies to all the @rajasthanroyals fans as that was a terrible display tonight in all 3 departments,” Warne tweeted a little after midnight. “The boys are trying & will come good so don’t lose hope, stay patient - we will get it right. Win the next 2 games and be 4/3 at the halfway stage - 2/5 is not ok !#IPL2018.”
  
  
 
 Will Warne’s apology help? The Royals will answer that on Sunday itself when they take on defending champions   at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. Their fortress had already been breached once (against KKR last Wednesday), and quite early in the tournament too. That does not augur well as Royals’ gameplan revolves around their strengths at home. Another home defeat could well push them way back in the race.
 
 Royals haven’t really got their act together, even though they have two wins to show. The big guns haven’t really fired, almost leaving young Sanju Samson as the lone warrior. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane is getting starts but not quite carrying on. The overseas players are showing promises before fizzling out. Jaydev Unadkat has yet to deliver even a portion of his price tags. After five games, it seems they are missing the assured presence of Steve Smith out there in the middle. In fact, he was the pivot around which the Royals team was built, with Ben Stokes as the most crucial element.
 
 Warne’s criticism might have come a little early in the day, but it is a wakeup call that Royals need to heed. If the mentor’s words do not spur them, nothing will.
