PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The BJP-ruled   has named about 20 existing as well as new welfare projects after prominent leaders of various communities and prominent   figures “to appease voters ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections”.

 The naming of these schemes was effected through a supplementary resolution approved by the standing committee for inclusion in the draft budget of 2018-19 on Thursday.
 
 Sant Gadge Maharaj, Mother Teresa, former President APJ Abdul Kalam, Rani Laxmibai, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, Rambhau Mhalgi, former PM AB Vajpayee, Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde are some of the personalities the schemes have been named after. 
 
 In a bid to appease Shiv Sena, political observers said, PCMC has also named some of the schemes after Bal Thackeray and Meenatai Thackeray. “This is all being done with eyes on the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2019,” the observers added.
 
 When contacted, Seema Savale, PCMC standing committee chief, said, “We have named the schemes after great leaders who have worked for the welfare of the society, irrespective of which community they belonged to. These are the social welfare schemes that will help the poor and the needy.”
 
 Sanjog Waghire, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad unit of NCP, said the BJP-ruled PCMC has only named the schemes that were started during the   and Congress rule. “They are trying to mislead people by taking credit for the work started by us. By doing this, they are just trying to appease voters ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” he said.
 
 Rahul Kalate of Shiv Sena welcomed the move, but said, “The administration should work towards ensuring that the benefits of these schemes reach the intended section of the society. Otherwise, this (the naming) will fail to serve its purpose.”
