NAGPUR: The BJP-ruled  , for the sixth consecutive year, is all set to miss the revenue target for 2017-2018. Against a target of Rs 2,266.97 crore, the civic body has recovered only Rs 875.37 crore in 10 months. As per the budget,   should have earned Rs 1,889.14 crore till January 31.

 This revenue shortfall will reflect in the revised budget for the current fiscal to be presented by municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal in mid-February. The civic chief will also present the budget for 2018-2019 at a special meeting of the standing committee.
 
 The budgets were to be presented on or before February 5 but got delayed due to reasons best known to the NMC. Mudgal will present the budgets to standing committee chairman  , whose tenure will end in March first week.
 
 According to data procured from accounts and finance department till January 31, the NMC earned Rs 124.81 lakh as local body tax, Rs 1,699.35 lakh property tax, Rs 842.69 lakh water works, Rs 95.50 lakh from market, Rs 194.31 lakh from town planning department, Rs 167.15 lakh from health department, Rs 5.04 lakh from birth and death certificates, Rs 488.91 lakh miscellaneous and Rs 5,136 lakh as Goods and  . Apart from this, the NMC is awaiting various government grants to the tune of Rs 276.96 crore. The revenue excludes other government grants of over Rs300 crore. In January 2017, the civic administration had earned Rs 1,006 crore.
 
 As a preventive measure, sources said, the civic chief may also order a cut in the annual budget of zones by 30% by eliminating low priority works as the civic body is heading for a financial crisis.
 
 Sources pointed out the shortfall was due to the inflated revenue targets set by the standing committee. But, the elected members keep inflating the budget every year while opposing any tax reforms to generate more revenue.
 
 Apart from this, sources in finance and accounts department said the civic chief may propose new sources of revenue. One of the measures, he may propose is to levy professional tax on the incomes earned while entering in a profession or trade or business.
 
 The   had also recommended that professional tax could be an important source of revenue for local bodies, if they are allowed to levy and collect it under state legislation within a reasonable ceiling set by the Parliament. Even the empowered committee of state finance ministers on the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) had recommended removing the cap on professional tax, which would bring more revenue to the states. “If levied, the NMC can generate an approximate revenue of Rs100 crore per annum,” sources added.
