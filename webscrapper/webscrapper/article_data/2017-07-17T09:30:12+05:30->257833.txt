   actor   shared a clip of a blooper that happened at the recently held award show in New York.
 
  In the video   is seen on the stage standing with an award to give it to the Best Actor, while at the same time she is seen sitting next to Shahid Kapoor, who won the Best Actor award for Udta Punjab.
  
  It is hilarious and one serious blunder made by the editing team of the show.
  
  
 
  
  Katrina, who glows in a blue gown, stands with the award on stage, and the next clip shows her sitting with Shahid Kapoor, waiting for the big announcement to be made. Did we just see Katrina's twin sister, or well we think the editor's job is in trouble.
  
    Patel shared the video clip on Twitter and wrote, " u have to see the clip .... what a blunder."
  
  
  
  
  
  His co-actor from the show Yeh Hai Mohabbatein and his onscreen wife   also commented on it with a laughing emoji.
