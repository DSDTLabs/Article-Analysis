I’m doing a space film with a youngster,  , in Tollywood; he had previously helmed The Ghazi Attack.

I have been in the industry for about 35 years and I guess I am fortunate that youngsters are thinking of me when they are making movies.” 
 
 The actor admits that he’s picky about roles, but says that he does cinema for the love of it. “Movies are my bread and butter, but I’m choosy about scripts. I’d once said that I was tired of doing police roles, but in the Tamil-Telugu bilingual 7, I play a cop. I agreed to do the film because the character is interesting,” he signs off.
