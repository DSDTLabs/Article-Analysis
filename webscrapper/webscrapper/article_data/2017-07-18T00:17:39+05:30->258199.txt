Chennai: It is not just commuters who are at the risk of getting mugged or assaulted in the dark and creepy giant fa√ßade that MRTS train stations in the city are. Even railway employees working there are under threat. Midnight on Sunday, the station manager of   station, B Suresh. 56), lost his costly smartphone.

 Sources said that Suresh had stepped out of his cabin and was standing on the platform as some electrical work was going on inside his cabin. The last train on the route had passed more than an hour ago. Suddenly a youngster caught him by surprise and snatched his phone and ran onto the tracks. After running for a few minutes, he slid down a pole near the elevated tracks, to the road below. 
 
 After much coaxing from his colleagues and wife, Suresh filed a complaint with the Thiruvanmiyur railway police station. 
 
 However, police has registered the case as theft case instead of robbery. The police personnel at the station declined to provide more details when TOI made enquiries.
 
 The station has a few women booking staff on the ground floor and there is little security. Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Naveen Gulati said that they had planned to cordon off the area and cut down on the multiple entry and exit points to the MRTS stations at night.
