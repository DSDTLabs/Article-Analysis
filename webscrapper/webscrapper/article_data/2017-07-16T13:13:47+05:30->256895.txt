MARGAO: State assembly speaker   on Saturday assured that the government will ensure the inclusion of the Cuncolim chieftains revolt against the Portuguese staged on July 15, 1583, into the school curriculum’s history textbooks.

 The incident, in 1583, saw Cuncolim villagers attacking and killing five Portuguese Jesuit priests, a European civilian and 14 native Christians after they found out that the priests were proceeding to Cuncolim to erect a cross in the village and select a site for building a church. Following the massacre, the Portuguese invited local leaders, from the kshatriya gaunkar community of Cuncolim, for talks at the Assolna fort, situated on the banks of the River Sal. Sixteen, of the 17 leaders, were executed by the Portuguese, while one escaped.
 
 Speaking as chief guest at the 434th anniversary of ‘the first war of independence’ jointly organised by Cuncolim chieftains memorial trust and Cuncolim municipal council, Sawant, recalled this demand being raised during the assembly session by former   MLA Vishnu Surya Wagh and former   MLA Subhash ‘Rajan’ Naik resulting in a committee being constituted to look into the matter.
