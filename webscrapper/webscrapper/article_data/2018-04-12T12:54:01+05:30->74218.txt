JAIPUR: As water logging and clogged   posed a major problem during monsoon in the last few years, the   ( ) has invited tenders for de-silting the drains on time. 

 The JMC has marked a target to desilt all the drains by June 1. The city has more than 1,010 small and big drains. Other than this, the desilting of bigger drains such as Ganda Nullah, Jawahar Nullah and Nag Talai will also be done in the stipulated time. 
 
 Every year, residents complain about sewage water entering their homes after the drains get choked. “The JMC does not have enough machines and manpower to handle the large number of complaints that simultaneously come from across the city. Choked sewerage is a common problem in our area. We hope this year the drains are cleaned on time,” said Alka Jain, a resident of Ghee Walo Ka Rasta, Walled City.
 
 A senior engineer at the   (JDA) said, “In the absence of a drainage system, water remains logged for long durations in Jaipur and hampers traffic flow. Timely de silting is very necessary.”
 
 Officials said the unplanned manner in which the construction of roads had been taken up is one of the major reasons for lack of an efficient drainage system.
 
 As there was no integrated plan for development of roads, the roads were widened in phases that disturbed the drainage system. “Now, authorities will face a bigger problem in building drains with no space left on either side of the roads,” the senior engineer said.
 
 Without an adequate system, officials said, the standing water in colonies and various major roads is not able to reach the bigger drains. The Amanishah Nullah, Ganda Nullah, Jawahar Nullah and Nag Talai are the bigger drains which finally meet at Dhund River.
