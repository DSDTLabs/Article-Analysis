AGARTALA:   health minister and  's Tripura election in charge   on Wednesday said his party is going to lodge a complaint with the EC charging the ruling   with extorting money from state government officials. 

 Sarma alleged that CPM has been collecting Rs 3,000 each from 1.5 lakh government employees forcefully in the name of special election funds. The money amounts to Rs 450 crore, he added. Sarma went on to say that in the name of election fund, CPM has been collecting money from households, traders, students and even daily wagers. 
 
 "We want to know what they will do with so much money in the election. CPM is going to buy vote or arms to win the election?" questioned Sarma. He added that such money collection drive is illegal under Section 384 of the IPC which penalizes extortion. He added that if CPM says the employees donated money voluntarily, then the EC must ensure that are involved in the election process.
 
 "We want CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar to come out with a list of employees from whom his party collected money and how much before the election notification is issued. Otherwise, we will file a criminal case against him for extortion," warned Sarma. Chief minister   must spell out how his administration allowed 'forceful' collection of money from government employees and common citizens, he added.
 
 Bijan Dhar said, "Yes, we are collecting funds from employees and others as we don't have corporate funding like BJP. Collecting money using coupons is not illegal. Today they are questioning money collection from employees, tomorrow they will tell them not to listen to political speeches and also not vote."
