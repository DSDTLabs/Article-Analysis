Faridkot: Upset over the shifting of the machinery of Faridkot cooperative sugar mill to Bhogpur near Jalandhar, AAP and a panel of town residents Khand Mill Bachao Sangharsh Committee have been on protest for the last 10 days. Party activist Gurdit Singh Sekhon on Monday started a fast-unto-death against the shifting of the machinery from the mill, which had been lying closed for the last 12 years.

 The struggle committee and AAP want the government to explore options to revive the Faridkot sugar mill. Earlier, AAP leaders, including Faridkot MP Sadhu Singh, leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Jaito MLA Baldev Singh had staged a sit-in against the moving of the sugar mill’s machinery to Bhogpur. Gurdit said that, “The cooperative sugar mill was the only the industry in the area. The government should make efforts to revive the mill so that employment could be generated and crop diversification could be achieved by making farmers to plant sugarcane.”
 
 “The state government wants to make money by selling the sugar mill land. We will not allow this to happen,” said the struggle committee convener Jiwanjot Kaur. Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of the ruling Congress said that, “Only junk-like machinery is being shifted out. The government is trying for the revival of the sugar factory. A cabinet sub-committee will debate over the issue if the mill could be revived, and if so, whether in public sector or private sector. A decision on the matter will be taken soon.”
 
 Faridkot DC Rajiv Parashar said that the state government had been apprised of the protest against the shifting of the sugar mill machinery.
