Since making the shift from the small screen to the big with Simpallag Innondh Love Story,   has been on the lookout for meaningful scripts that would help him find a footing in the industry. He made baby steps in that direction with his subsequent projects, which, he says, were concept-oriented films. His next is  , which Praveen says not only allowed him to work with a good team, but will also give him the big break he has been working towards.

 “When I first met director  , he was trying to put a team together for the film and did not even have a producer on board. He showed me a short film that he had made earlier, which I quite liked. It underlined the fact that he was technically sound. Raghu then narrated the script of Churikatte and I was floored as the character had two distinctive shades. But I was not sure if the producer he finds would want me to do it. Luckily, it all worked out and I was signed up,” says Praveen.
 
 In the film, the actor has two looks — one for the early part of the film, in which he is a fresh college graduate, who aspires to become a police officer. “I had a clean shaven look and lost some weight for it, after which we had a schedule break that allowed me to bulk up a bit and grow facial fuzz for the rest of the film,” says Praveen.
 
 His most memorable moments from Churikatte, adds the actor, came from sharing screen space with seasoned actors like   and  , among others. “When I first heard about my co-stars, I was a bundle of nerves, but once on set, I realized what years of experience does to actors like them. They become the easiest to work with. You not only learn nuances of acting from them, but also about how to carry yourself on set, among other things. It was truly humbling,” says Praveen.
