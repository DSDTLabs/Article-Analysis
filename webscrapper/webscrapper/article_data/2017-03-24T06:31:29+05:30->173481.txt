GURUGRAM: Residents of  , a   where a leopard was   in November last year, reported two   on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 Dev Prakash, a passer-by, who claims to have spotted a leopard, said, “It was around 5pm. I was in the fields when I saw the big cat. I immediately fled the place and alerted other villagers, but by the time the leopard had vanished.”
 
 The wildlife department has been sending a team to the area regularly for the last two days. “However, we haven’t found any pugmarks yet. Villagers many a time mistook civet cat or hyena for a leopard in the past. We are also running a campaign to spread awareness among villagers to protect the wildlife,” said Shyam Sunder, district forest officer (wildlife), said.
 
 In January, leopards were caught on camera thrice in Gurgaon and Faridabad area. While a male leopard was spotted on January 22 in Mangar, a female leopard was sighted the same day in Bandhwari area. Both the areas are located in a radius of 15 kilometres from Mandwar village.
