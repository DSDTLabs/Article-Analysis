Kolkata: A CBI team, in its probe to ascertain the authenticity of the video footage of the   sting operation, is likely to visit the Apple Inc headquarters in California, US.

  The agency, which has been in touch with Apple Inc for some time, is trying to access the original footage that might be stored on the Apple cloud platform. The visit may also help untangle some technical questions the CBI is facing in court.
 
 Trinamool leaders Aparupa Poddar and Iqbal Ahmed had challenged the authenticity of the tapes in HC on the ground that its originality could not be ascertained in absence of the original device. 
 
 Mathew Samuel had claimed that after shooting the meetings with the Narada accused, he used to dump the phone’s content in a laptop. Later, he submitted the laptop with the CBI, but did not submit the Apple phone.
 
 Poddar’s lawyer Sidharth Luthra had alleged that Samuel had formatted the laptop before he handed it over to the CBI. He also argued that the metadata inside it was erased, which made it impossible to ascertain how the data was transferred or modified.
