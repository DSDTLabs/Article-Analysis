Ten students from Bengaluru recently visited and volunteered at a French NGO, Utopia 56, that helps refugees in Calais, France. Students from  , aged between 16-18 years, spent a few days at the Auberge des Migrants, or refugee hostels and warehouses, in Calais.
Chandniee Tushar Iyengar, Head of Languages at Trio World Academy, who accompanied the students during the trip, said, “Students who are a part of the International Baccalaureate curriculum have to study a foreign language and in the process learn about the target country, its culture and more. In this case, students who have taken up French, learn about France. A portion of their curriculum also touches on the migration topic. Hence, we thought it would be a good thing to organise a trip for the students to France, do some volunteer work and interact with refugees, so that they get to know how the country deals with migrant crisis.”
 Students pursuing the diploma programme, says Chandniee, have to complete Creativity, Activity, Service profile as part of their curriculum. “Under creativity and activity, students generally take up activities like music and sports. But for the service part, they need to do some voluntary or social service work. By taking them to a refugee centre in Calais, not only did they volunteer at the centre, but they also got to interact with a few refugees, which was a learning experience for them,” says Chandniee, adding, “In addition to this, they got to experience how France deals with the migrant crisis, since most of the immigrants pass through France, while crossing over to other European countries, especially the UK.” In addition to this, the students also visited the   in Paris, where they participated in the   conferences and the Mobile Learning Week workshops.
