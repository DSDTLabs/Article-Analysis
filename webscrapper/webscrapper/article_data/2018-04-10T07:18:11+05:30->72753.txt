CHENNAI: This Tamil New Year (April 14), cinemagoers may not be able to celebrate with a new Tamil film release due to the ongoing strike, say producers and theatre owners. Though the meeting of film industry unions with information and publicity minister   on Tuesday could spell the end of the strike, called by producers six weeks ago, theatre owners remain sceptical.

 “We have nothing to do with the ongoing strike. We want it to end it immediately as the holiday season is almost here. But producers are not willing to accept their mistake and call off the strike. It will take a miracle for the strike to end this week,” said Tiruppur Subramaniam, TN West Zone Theatre Owners’ Association president and owner of Sri Sakthi cinemas.
 
 The previous years had seen the release of big banner films such as Mani Ratnam’s ‘O Kadhal Kanmani’, the Vijay-starrer ‘Theri’ and Dhanush’s directorial debut ‘Pa Paandi’ on Tamil New Year. The ongoing strike is a result of a standoff between   and   over payment of virtual print fee (VPF) to digital service providers (DSPs) such as   and UFO.
 
 “We are not willing to share the cost of VPF with the producers. We have agreed to their other demand to computerise the booking of movie tickets in the interest of a transparent box office collection reports,” said Subramaniam. Owing to the “exorbitant” VPF rates charged by major DSPs,   has decided to bring in smaller players to challenge Qube. “Bringing in smaller players to replace Qube is not a viable idea. We cannot go in for players who do not have the latest digital projection technology,” said Subramaniam.
 
 TFPC treasurer S R Prabhu, who will be part of the delegation set to meet minister Raju, said, “Release of new films on Tamil New Year is unlikely as of now.” Since producers suspended the release of new Tamil films on March 1, theatre owners have kept away from gatherings called by TFPC, such as the Sunday protest demanding formation of Cauvery Management Board.
