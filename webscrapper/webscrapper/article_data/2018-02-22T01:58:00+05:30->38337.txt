NEW DELHI: The   has held that raw and scaled marks awarded to candidates in   ( ) examination cannot be revealed under the Right to Information Act and set aside the Delhi high court order asking UPSC to disclose the marks.

 A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit allowed the plea of UPSC which contended that disclosure of marks could lead to compromising the integrity of the examination system and people would come to know about the scaling system used by it. The Commission contended that the corrections made in the answer book would likely arouse doubt and perhaps even suspicion in the candidate’s mind and this would not only breed grievances, but would likely lead to litigation.
 
 “Weighing the need for transparency and accountability on the one hand and requirement of optimum use of fiscal resources and confidentiality of sensitive information on the other, we are of the view that information sought with regard to marks in Civil Services Exam cannot be directed to be furnished mechanically. Situation of exams of other academic bodies may stand on different footing. Furnishing raw marks will cause problems as pleaded by the UPSC which will not be in public interest,” the bench said.
