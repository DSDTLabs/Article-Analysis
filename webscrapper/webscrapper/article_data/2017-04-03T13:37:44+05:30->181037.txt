TRICHY: A 55-year old   was fatally struck down by a passenger train when he was engaged in changing tracks of a goods train near   on Saturday. The victim has been identified as Mahadevappa hailing from  . 

 According to railway officials, Mahavdevappa had left to change the tracks of the goods train that was arriving from Srirangam at 7pm. When he did not return to the station even after 8:30pm, it raised suspicion among other officials. His body was later found on the railway track.
 
 Mahadevappa was most likely to have been hit by Thanjavur bound Uzhavar Express, said Annie Z Vijaya, superintendent of police, Trichy railway.
 
 Police said there are chances that Mahadevappa was perhaps walking on the track and failed to notice the train. Moreover, it would have been difficult for the train driver to stop the train, even after sighting someone on the track, especially during night hours. 
 
 â€œWe are conducting an enquiry and a clear picture will emerge only after investigation, Annie Z Vijaya said.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said that there could have been a possible miscommunication between the railway officials, which could have led to this accident. As Mahadevappa was said to have been walking on the track at the time of the accident, there are chances that he was misguided about the possible time of the passenger train crossing the track.
 
 The body was sent to the government hospital for post mortem. A case has been registered under section 174 of the Cr PC of unnatural death and further investigations are on.
