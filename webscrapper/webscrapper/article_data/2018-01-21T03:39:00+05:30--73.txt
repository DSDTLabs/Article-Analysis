Panaji: From the smile on her face, it is difficult to grasp the extent of her disappointment at first. Parul Dhariwal, a physically-challenged girl, landed in Goa on January 17 with her parents. It was Parul’s first holiday in four years, eagerly anticipated and meticulously planned to her dream destination in Goa.

 But, Parul received news about the strike called by tourist   operators only on the day after she landed in Goa. “I was waiting for the last four years to undertake the trip after completing my studies. I answered my company secretary (CS) inter exam in September and then we booked this holiday. It was Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 down the drain. We were stuck at our resort in Porvorim,” said Parul, while waiting to board her train on Saturday to Mumbai, from where the family will fly to Kolkata.
 
 Parul said that she and her parents were lucky enough to be able to get in touch with her friend, who agreed to drop the trio off at the Karmali railway station.
 
 “On January 18, we did a point-to-point city tour and we were supposed to go across South Goa for sightseeing on January 19 and 20. It turned out to be a very boring trip,” Parul said. 
 
 “And the hotel where we were staying refused to help us in anyway in getting to Karmali railway station. If our friend had not agreed to drop us to the station, I don’t know what we would have done.” 
 
 Her mother Sudha, a homemaker, said that she felt that they had spent all that money to only step onto Goa’s soil and go back, while her father Binod said that they were not even able to eat a meal at any other restaurant other than the one at the hotel.
 
 “Next time, we are planning a holiday to Goa, we will give the Goa government a call before going ahead with our bookings,” said an annoyed Parul.
