CHHAPRA: Union minister for skill development and entrepreneurship   on Monday rued the slow implementation of the   to   (industrial training institutes) and   in the   in eight states, including Bihar.

 The Saran MP said while reviewing the implementation of this scheme, it has been noticed that the significant part of the mandate remained unfulfilled at the state level. With this aim, the minister has sought Bihar chief minister’s cooperation and requested him to personally supervise the work for its faster implementation. “However, the progress so far can clearly be termed as disappointing” Rudy alleged.
 
 Under the scheme, one ITI each has been assigned to Jamui, Gaya, Rohtas, Arwal, Jehanabad and Aurangabad in Bihar. “Except in Jamui, work in rest of the districts is yet to begin,” he said, adding that in recent modification, Muzaffarpur, Banka and Nawada have been included on the list for which Bihar government is yet to submit a proposal for the release of funds for the construction of the ITIs. Similarly, there has been no progress in the proposed 12 skill development centres (SDC) at Jhajha, Giddaur, Barachatti, Aamash, Navi Nagar, Madanpur, Rohats, Nauhatta, Jehanabad, Hulasganj, Karpi and Kurtha, he added.
 
 The Centre is supposed to give 75 per cent of the total budgetary support to the scheme and the rest is to come from the states. “The Centre has allocated 4,171.68 lakh out of which 2,676.47 lakh has been released, but the states failed to utilise it, making it difficult for the Centre release further funds,” Rudy said.
