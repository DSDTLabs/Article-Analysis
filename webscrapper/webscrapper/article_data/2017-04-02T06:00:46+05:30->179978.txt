BENGALURU: A  ,  , hung over the Nandi Layout   in north Bengaluru on Saturday. Constables, many of whom had decades of experience behind them, could be seen preparing for their new roles - starting Saturday, each constable beatsl be entrusted the responsibility of maintaining law and order in a specific locality. 

    DG&IGP RK Dutta has directed all police stations to assign the constables a 'beat', wherein they will keep a close watch on the locality they have been assigned, in addition to dispensing their routine duties such as issuing summons and warrants. 
 
  When STOI paid a visit to the Nandini Layout station, inspector M Sadanand was busy assigning the constables zones using a Google map. "There are 27 beats (zones) that are further divided into sub-beats. Now, we will visit our areas twice a day, interact with the locals on a regular basis. We will contact our informants and sources through phone," cops said. 
 
  The same scene was being played out in all 110 police stations in the city. Along with directions and a brief sketch of their responsibilities, the constables were also warned that lapses in duty could lead to an inquiry. Stations in other districts have been given time till April 15 to implement the directive. "I have instructed all commissioners and superintendents to send me feedback by the end of the month. In other districts, constables will be assigned beats in two phases - one set will be given them by April 15, and the second by April 30," Dutta said. 
 
  In the other districts, the constables would be responsible for law and order in the villages too, and also maintain traffic during festive occasions. 
 
  Kolar Gold Fields SP Lokesh Kumar said, "Constables from nine stations will be assigned beats."
