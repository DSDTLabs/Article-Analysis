BENGALURU: In what is said to be a rare case at paediatric emergency, an 11-month-old boy, who picked up a fish from an aquarium at home and swallowed it, was treated at city-based hospital two weeks ago.

 The infant, who had started bleeding from the mouth and choking for breath, was taken to   hospital in   and treated at the emergency medicine unit. The boy survived and the live fish was cut into pieces and taken out. The incident was one of the case studies documented for publication at the 10th National Assembly on Paediatric Emergency Medicine ( ) held in Bengaluru on Saturday.
 
 “Children with history of foreign body ingestion are routinely seen in the emergency medicine department. But the accidental ingestion of a live fish is very uncommon. The fish was stuck in the throat of the boy causing respiratory distress,” said Dr Rashmi N, paediatrician who treated the baby and presented the case at the NAPEM conference.
 
 The boy had developed fluid retention near the throat that led to swelling, as the fish was stuck there initially. His condition was first stabilized in the paediatric ICU where he underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy, and that’s when the fish was seen in the stomach. It was cut into pieces and removed.
 
 When contacted, the boy’s father said he always used to watch the fish moving around in the aquarium. “The aquarium was within his reach and he had recently started to stand with the table’s support. On the day of the incident, he was in the living room and picked up the fish and swallowed it. Immediately after noticing the act, one of my relatives rushed him to hospital. Thankfully, he survived,” he said. The infant was on ventilator for a day and was discharged after three days at the hospital.
 
 According to Dr  , paediatrician who headed the team that treated the boy, this rare case emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and safe approach in removal of a foreign body which can be near fatal.
