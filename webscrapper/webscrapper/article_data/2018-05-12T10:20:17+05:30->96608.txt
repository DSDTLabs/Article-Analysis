KOCHI: The high court on Friday dismissed an appeal filed by hospital managements challenging a single bench’s decision not to stay state government’s notification revising minimum wages of nurses.

 The appeal, filed by Kerala Private Hospitals’ Association (KPHA) and   chairman Hussain Koya Thangal, challenging a single bench’s decision of May 4, was considered by a division bench led by Justice Sunil Thomas.
 
 After considering a petition filed by KPHA during admission hearing, the single bench had said that it cannot issue a stay on the notification without a detailed hearing.
 
 While stating that no interference is needed on the single bench’s decision not to grant a stay, the division bench said no material has been produced by the association to show that a stay on the notification is essential.
 
 Opposing the association, state government’s counsel had argued that all requirements as per Minimum Wages Act have been complied with and views of all stakeholders were sought by the government prior to issuing the notification. There is no need to stay a notification issued in such a manner, the government counsel submitted.
 
 While seeking a stay on the notification issued on April 23, KPHA had contended that hospitals would be pushed to a crisis if the notification is implemented as it is. The notification also suffers from procedural irregularity and goes against principles fixed through statutes and by the decisions of the high court and the Supreme Court, KPHA submitted.
