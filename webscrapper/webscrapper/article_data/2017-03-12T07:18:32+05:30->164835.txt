CHENNAI: A century-old sewer line running under the arterial stretch of   that was damaged during   had been keeping CMRL workers busy for more than a month.   said the sewer line built during the British-period was damaged during   to connect two parallel tunnels running between   and  .

 Authorities did not know about the sewage line that ran at a depth of 6m when they started work to build a crossover passage meant to evacuate commuters during a fire or when a train breaks down.
 
 A large pit has been dug up in the centre of the road near Anna Road Head Post Office and a team of workers had been on the job for more than three weeks to repair the sewer line. They had to draw out the grout, used for tunnelling purposes, which clogged the line and fix the damage caused while building a cross passage.
 
 “The grout has been drawn out and repair is almost complete. The pit will be closed and the road will be laid in one week's time,“ said a metro rail official.
 
 Metro rail officials said they were constructing a cross passage to connect two tunnels running at about 16m underground when they accidentally hit a sewer line that ran about six metres below ground level. The grout used for constructing the cross passage flooded the sewer line blocking the flow of sewage.
 
 After Metrowater officials observed that the sewage was not flowing properly, they alerted metro rail officials who immediately sent a team of workers to repair the line.
 
 A Metrowater official said, “During metro rail work, the sewer line opposite the post office on Anna Salai was damaged. For the past one-and-a-half months, metro rail is rebuilding the broken sections of the line. Initially, they had to pump out sewage from one chamber to another using a motor before the work could begin. I do not know about this construction liquid blocking the sewer line. I shall check on it.“
