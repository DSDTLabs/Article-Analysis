 According to sources, the bosses of 'Love Island' had hinted at the disapproval of the glamour model's relationship, prompting her to call it quits with Tyga after growing tired of his 'wandering eye',.
 
 The 27-year-old 'Mac & Devin Go to High School' actress, had been dating  's ex since July.
 
 A close friend of Howe's said, "Tyga treated her well and she really liked being with him but she couldn't get serious with him because he was doing what he wants."
 
 "She found him possessive and felt he had double standards. He had a wandering eye and would act like a single man," it added.
 
 The chance for Howe to find Mr. Right in the 'Love Island' villa this summer has proven too good of an opportunity to turn down.
