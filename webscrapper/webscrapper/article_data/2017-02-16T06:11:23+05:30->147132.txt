AHMEDABAD: The   has announced that school number 23 and 20 in Asarwa will be named after Lance Naik Gopalsingh Bhadoria who was martyred in a fierce gun battle with terrorists in Kulgam district of Jammu & Kashmir. 

 The decision was taken at the two-day budget board which began on Wednesday. Homage was paid to Bhadoria when the board assembled. Later, mayor Gautam Shah announced the decision to rename the schools.
 
  The proposal will now be cleared by the standing committee of the corporation and then by the next AMC board, scheduled to meet next month. 
 
 “This is a board only for clearing the budget and hence no other work can be taken up,” said a senior officer of the AMC. The Gujarat government has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the family of the soldier. The government has also decided to build a memorial for him. As for the board, later in the day, it appointed former mayor Meenakshi Patel as the chair of the meeting as Shah was not available.
 
 The board did not draw any political debate during the discussion. But the Congress has taken issue with the low budget for the VS hospital. 
 
 The meeting will continue on Thursday when it is likely to be stormy. A discussion on the main budget will be taken up at that meeting. The Congress is already planning to bring up mismanagement and the lack of basic infrastructure in the city.
