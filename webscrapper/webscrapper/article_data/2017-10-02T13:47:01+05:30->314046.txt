MUMBAI: A 25-year-old man who hailed from an   in Gujarat was recently arrested by   for allegedly stealing   from train commuters to fund his lavish lifestyle. Two of his friends from Gujarat have also been arrested for buying the stolen cellphones from him. 

 "Akash Patel would target commuters on crowded trains or platforms and snatch their gold chains or expensive cellphones. He would then go pub-hopping and splurge his ill-gotten money on a string of girlfriends," said a GRP officer. Patel, whose father is a landowner in Surat, was on the run after committing similar offences on trains in Surat three years ago. He has also snatched phones from commuters on Vadodara railways in the past. "We are probing whether he was involved in similar crimes when he was underage," added the officer.
 
 When GRP informed Patel’s family in Surat about his arrest, his father said he had severed ties with him. His sisters, based overseas, echoed the same sentiment and told the officials that he deserves to be punished if he had committed a crime. GRP officials said Patel was last arrested by Surat railway police in 2014. He slipped out of the state after being released on bail. 
 
 At the Dadar GRP outpost, Patel was booked for three offences of stealing cellphones and three others for jewellery theft. Police tapped their network of informants who led them to Patel at his rented  . 
 
 A team, comprising sub-inspector Digambar Barad and head constable Shashikant Londhe, went to Bardoli and recovered 20 stolen cellphones worth a total Rs 3.5 lakh. After his arrest, his friends in Bardoli in Surat who had bought the stolen goods went into hiding. Police tracked down two of them—Tejas Patel (24) and Mohan Prajapati (23). 
 
 "We have traced the owners of three phones," said an officer.
