LUCKNOW: Three years after the Lucknow bench of the high court ordered for immediate repair work to be taken up at the historical Chhota  , work is yet to see completion, leaving the monument open to more damage. 

 The task was assigned by the court jointly to the district administration, Archaeological Survey of India ( ),   and Allied Trust (HAT) and the state first in its order in 2014, followed by another in 2015. 
 
 Following complete neglect, the heritage activist on whose PIL the order had come on Sunday shot another round of letters to the superintending archaeologist of ASI and the senior superintendent of police (SSP). 
 
 In his letter,   has asked both authorities to not just re-start repairs within a definite timeline, but also asked for issuance of notices to those encroaching upon the monument's gates. 
 
 The police itself have encroached upon a part of the western gate through an outpost. There needs to be immediate corrective action taken for restoring both the facade of the monument and the gates," said Haider. 
 
 Repair work had also come under the wire previously after HAT used cement on the facade of the 180-year-old Nawabi-era monument. 
 
 "The insensitivity of HAT towards the breathablity of the monument invited intervention of the high court which than constituted a committee to check the work," he said. 
 
 The committee had declared that the use of cement had caused "irreversible damage" to the monument. 
 
 On Sunday,   said, "If no action is taken by the authorities, there will be no option left than to move court again."
