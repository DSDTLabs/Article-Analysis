CHENNAI: AR/VR startup Imaginate has bagged $500k (approximately Rs 3.5 crore) in funding from SRI Capital, a seed stage venture fund based out of Philadelphia, US. Hemanth Satyanarayana founded Imaginate’s early seed investor IIIT Hyderabad has exited with this funding round. Serial entrepreneur and investor Sashi Reddi, managing partner of SRI Capital, has joined the company’s board of directors.

 Imaginate’s teleportation product NuSpace offers a hardware agnostic, collaboration platform that enables people to communicate with one another in an immersive and interactive and realistic virtual world. Satyanarayana explains,”NuSpace will allow multiple users to come together and interact with others avatars, with any headset of their choice. With NuSpace, one could be wearing a Mixed Reality device like HoloLens from Microsoft and others could be wearing Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard , making the platform hardware agnostic.”
 
 With a 2 Mbps connection, every NuSpace user can communicate with one another across geographies through their realistic avatars. Satyanarayana says this is less than the minimum internet speed that a HD video connection would need.
