HYDERABAD: Sending out a strong and unequivocal signal that they will fight till the end to protect the judiciary, the   and   Advocates Associations on Thursday boycotted work at the Hyderabad High Court and held a protest rally demanding immediate filling up of vacant posts of judges. 

 The protesting advocates also sought appointment of a full-fledged Chief Justice to the high court, which has been running with Acting CJs for the last three years. They also sought setting up of a   bench at Hyderabad that will cater to the needs of South India. 
 
 The advocates also demanded scrapping of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gives enormous powers to the police to deal with the accused. The main demand, however, was to fill up vacancies in the high court and subordinate courts to set right the adjudication process that has been derailed for over three years. 
 
 The functioning of the high court came to a standstill due to the strike by lawyers. Both  , president of  , and Jalli Kanakaiah, president of Telangana HC Bar Association, along with their executive committees, stood in the forefront of the agitation decrying the inordinate delay in the filling up of posts that are lying vacant for years. 
 
 On Tuesday, both the associations had held an extraordinary general body meeting and given a call to boycott work at the high court on March 1 and 2. Accordingly, the lawyers said they will strike work on Friday too. Extending solidarity to the HC legal fraternity, lawyers at several district courts too boycotted work on Thursday. 
 
 Later in the day, the advocates holding placards took out a rally from the High Court till   Junction. Several lawyers from the lower courts too participated in the rally. The protesters sat on dharna at Gulzar Houz near Madina junction. Police were deployed in huge numbers on the high court premises.
