Vadodara: Sumandeep Vidyapeethâ€™s scam-tainted founder, Mansukh Shah, has filed an application in the sessions court seeking permission to have home-cooked food and boiled water.

 Shah has sought court directions to the Vadodara Central Jail authorities for these facilities. 
 
 In his application, Shah told the court that he practices Jainism and eats food according to the rituals of the religion. He has told the court that he eats only home-made food and takes dinner before 6 pm. Since the central jail does not have facility of boiled water and Jain food, he has not consumed any food since March 6.
 
 Shah expressed fears that his health could deteriorate if the situation persists and he is not allowed to have home food. He has also requested the court to allow him to have his dinner before 5.30 pm.
 
 Shah and his two aides - Ashok Tailor and Vinod alias Bharat Savant - were arrested for running a high-profile cash-for-marks scam on February 28. He was sent to jail on March 6 as five days police custody ended. The application will be heard on Thursday by principal district and sessions judge J C Doshi.
