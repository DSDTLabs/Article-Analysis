BHOPAL: Railway employees of   division miss the zing of Holi festivities. A celebration of colours is held at the railway playground on Sunday, but many of them feel it lacks the flavour of the good old days.

 Prakash Rai, one of the oldest railway employees here, said, “I have attended Holi celebration in this division for more than 25 years. The way we used to celebrate even five years ago was totally different from what we do now. Earlier, we used to dance for hours, and a large number of employees joined in. There were snacks and thandai,” he said.
 
 Nowadays, it seems like a “formality”, he rued. “No one really joins in. The arrangement isn’t proper, either. Several restrictions have been imposed upon us during celebration,” Rai said.
 
 Sachin, a divisional commercial inspector at Bhopal station, said, “We started celebrating Holi in the division some 25 years back. For 20 years, it went very well. Now, the celebration is amere formality in which members and officials just come and give speeches. Then, we just wish each other and take lunch.”
 
  employee Rakesh said, “Earlier, you could feel the Holi mood a week in advance, but now even a day before Holi, there is no excitement in the division.”
