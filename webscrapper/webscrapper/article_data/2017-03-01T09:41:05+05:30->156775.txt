THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   once again became the topic of dispute in the LDF with the CPI coming out against power minister  's statement in the assembly on Tuesday.

 Mani told the house that the government is going ahead with the controversial project on the downstreams of the Chalakudy River in Thrissur district and that of the 312 megawatt it plans to generate from 15 new hydroelectric projects, 163 megawatt will be from Athirappilly.
 
 CPI state secretary Kaanam Rajendran soon came out with a statement that it might be the opinion of the state electricity board and the power minister. But the final decision on the project has to come from the LDF and the LDF has not taken any decision on this, he added.
 
 The Congress-led opposition also came out protesting against the government's decision to go ahead with the project and warned of an agitation.
 
 Mani also said the government was going ahead with the land acquisition for the project and the government is for implementing the project. When the   came to power, the first power minister   had also taken a similar stand which invited the wrath of the CPI.Following a lack of consensus, the issue had been kept on the back burner by the CPM.
 
 Meanwhile, KPCC president V M Sudheeran alleged that the contracts lob by in the KSEB are behind the project. Everyone knows that the state is not going to benefit from the Athirappilly project. However, the contractors are aiming at the profits they will get while implementing the project, he added. “The   will launch an agitation against the government if it goes ahead with the project. The government cannot go ahead with a project like this when there is lack of consensus,“ said Sudheeran.
