NEW DELHI/ ISLAMABAD: India on Thursday accused Pakistan of carrying out cheap propaganda on imprisoned  , demanding that   should carry out its “ïnternational obligations on consular relations”. India’s reaction came after Pakistan put out yet another video of   in which he claims on camera that he had not been tortured by Pakistan and instead accused an Indian diplomat of “yelling” at his mother and wife after their meeting with him on December 25. 

 “The Indian person or diplomat accompanying my mother and wife started yelling at them as soon as they stepped out of the meeting,” Jadhav was shown as saying in the video shared by Pakistan’s foreign office with reporters during a weekly press briefing. “I have something very important to say here to the Indian people, the government and the Indian navy: I am a commissioned officer in the   and my commission is not over,” Jadhav was heard as saying. 
 
 “I saw fear in the eyes of my mother and my wife. Why should there be fear? Whatever has happened has happened. There shouldn’t be fear in the eyes of my mother and my wife,” he said. India dismissed it as a “propagandist exercise” by Pakistan, using a death row convict to put out coerced statements on video. 
 
 MEA spokesperson   said, “Pakistan is simply continuing its practice of putting out coerced statements on video. It is time for them to realise that such propagandistic exercises simply carry no credibility.” Jadhav is heard saying, “During the meeting, it looked like my mother had been beaten and brought here on a plane.” 
 
 The video comes days after India expressed its displeasure over the way Pakistan had treated the Jadhav family as well as breaching the understandings that had been reached.
