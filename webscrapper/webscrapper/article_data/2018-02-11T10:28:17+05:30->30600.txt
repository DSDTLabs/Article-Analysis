KOHIMA: The   ( ), the state's biggest church organisation, has come out in open condemnation of the Centre's policies, urging the state's political leaders to rely on the state's own strengths for development. 

 "We can develop ourselves if we can say 'enough is enough'. For that matter, leave the   alone and let it take its own course. If it were possible, it would have happened a long time ago," NBCC general secretary   said in a letter of appeal addressed to all political parties. 
 
 Strongly opposing what it calls the "invasion" of Hindutva forces in Nagaland, Rev Keyho said the party in power at the Centre is fighting tooth and nail to assert its presence in Nagaland, a Christian-majority state. 
 
 "We cannot deny that the Hindutva movement in the country has become strong and invasive in an unprecedented manner over the last few years with the  , the political wing of the RSS, in power," Rev Keyho said.
