Chandigarh: As many as 320 aspirants for the job of constables have failed the dope test conducted during recruitment for the first time. 

 Police officials said 36,000 (8,000 woman candidates) out of more than 86,000 had cleared the physical efficiency and measurement test held at the Sector 26 police lines. Police took urine samples of all the successful candidates. Out of these, 320 tested positive for drugs.
 
 The Punjab Police had undertaken a similar exercise last year. The objective is to rule out the possibility of drug addicts getting into the police department.
 
 A total of 2.14 lakh people had applied against the 520 posts of constables.
 
 Police had started the recruitment process on April 17. Daily, 3,000 aspirants were called for the physical test in three batches. A reason behind less participation was the gap between the date of advertising the posts and starting the recruitment. Police asked for online applications in December 2015 and the tests were conducted after a gap of more than one year. Another reason was the weather. Police started the tests in April and concluded them in July during the peak summer season. The successful candidates will have to sit for a written test. The computer-based test will be held between September and October. The police have introduced the online test for the first time because some candidates had alleged that during the written test for the recruitment of wireless operators some candidates had used unfair means. The matter had reached the court.
 
 Out of the 520 posts, 193 will be filled by male candidates, 67 seats by ex-servicemen and 260 are reserved for women candidates.
