Mumbai: The 20-year-old  ,   for masturbating in front of two women in the   at CSMT on June 29, was remanded in judicial custody for seven days by a railway court on Thursday. Police said Ashok Pradhan (20), who does not have a previous crime record, lives on the streets near GPO or inside  . 

 A victim filmed Pradhan in the act and alerted a cop on the platform on June 29. But the cop told her to occupy another seat and took no action. Pradhan was arrested on Wednesday after TOI reported the incident. 
 
 “We checked CCTV footage of CSMT and spotted Pradhan getting off the  . He had an injury on his left leg which was bandaged. On his arrest, we seized the clothes he had worn that day. The bandage was still on his leg,” a GRP official said. Pradhan admitted to the offence. 
 
 The victim, who later blogged about the experience, told TOI, “What is a girl who does not know how to use social media or does not have contacts in the press, to do when she goes through such an experience? What is one supposed to do when a uniformed cop does not help? I’m sure many such incidents have gone unreported.”
 
 She was amazed why the GRP was not disclosing the name of the cop who had told her to change her seat. “Everyone is criticising the authorities now but none of this blaming would have happened if the cop had acted on my complaint that day. Why does the media have to be involved to get the authorities moving?” she asked.
