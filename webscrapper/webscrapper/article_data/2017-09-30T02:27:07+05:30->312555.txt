Navi Mumbai: The public works department ( ) has carried out asphalting work under the   flyover to fill up the potholes after TOI reported about the inconvenience faced by motorists on the stretch. 

 Motorists were having a tough time manoeuvring the potholes under the Vashi   at the intersection of   highway. Traffic snarls were the order of the day owing to the potholes. 
 
 Santosh Nair, a motorist and resident of Kamothe, said, “Though the road intersection under the Vashi flyover has been refurbished after filling up the potholes, it remains to be seen whether the quality of raw material used for asphalting will sustain the continuous movement of vehicles.”
 
 Another motorist, Vinayak Bhor from Vashi, said, “Even if potholes resurface under the Vashi flyover, the PWD should immediately carry out the refurbishment of the road before an accident occurs on this spot, as bikers are more prone to fatal mishaps due to potholes.”
