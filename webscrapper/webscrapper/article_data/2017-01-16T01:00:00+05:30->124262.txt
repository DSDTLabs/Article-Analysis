 ,   brings a show with a difference, 'Ghulaam'. 
A realistic story set in a fictitious crime capital called  , it’s a tale from the heartland of India that showcases how men rule the place with their own shocking set of laws. 
 Produced by Saurabh Tewari, Ghulaam revolves around Rangeela ( ), an anti-hero, who is fearless and ferocious, yet a puppet. He will go to any lengths to fulfil the wishes of his master. But as the story unfolds, will he undergo a change of heart? Will he go against his own principles or stand up to change the fate of Berahampur? That remains to be seen. 
 About his role, Param says, “The transformation from a boy-next-door to an anti-hero who performs intense action sequences has been challenging. My biggest inspiration is Aamir Khan. Call it a co-incidence, but both my character’s name — Rangeela — and the show’s title — 'Ghulaam' — are strongly linked to him. So, I hope that we receive the same kind of support from the audience as well.”
