THANE: The Thane   department, on Thursday, conducted a   drive as part of the   campaign by giving roses and sorry notes to those who parked their vehicles in no-parking zones. 

 The   started early in the morning at Kopri, Naupada, Kapurbawdi, Kasarwadavli and other parts of the   and continued till late evening. 
 
 Over 1,200 traffic   were given sorry notes which stated, ‘So sorry your vehicle was found obstructing traffic. Please don’t do it again.’
 
 Anil Mangale, traffic inspector, said, “We usually charge offenders fine of Rs 200 but on Thursday we did not take action against the law-breakers. We stuck sorry notes on their two and four-wheelers which were found parked in no-parking zones or blocked lanes. We also placed roses with the notes. The gesture was to show that what they did was wrong but without offending them. Many even promised to not repeat their mistakes and removed their vehicles by apologizing to us.” 
 
 Not only motorists, but also hawkers who had parked their carts in the middle of the road or were causing traffic congestion were given the notes.
 
 The traffic department had even called radio jockeys and interviewed the traffic offenders on why they had parked their vehicles in the no-parking zones and what they thought about the move.
 
 “The name of the violator was announced on the radio and their views about the drive were taken. Some claimed that the move was a better way to show them their mistakes and were even guilty about breaking the rules,” said Mangale.
