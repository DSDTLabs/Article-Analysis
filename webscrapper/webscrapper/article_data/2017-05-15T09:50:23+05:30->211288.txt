PUNE: The ruling   ( ) and the Nationalist   (NCP), which has a stronger hold on the city’s outskirts, have locked horns in the villages that are going to grampanchayat elections soon. 

 While BJP MLAs in the fringes insist that the state government must not conduct panchayat elections in 19 of the 34 villages scheduled to be merged in the city limits, NCP leaders said the BJP is playing dirty politics.
 
 The election schedule is already out with the deadline for filing of nominations ending last week. Ten villages decided to refrain from filing nominations citing the pending merger. Sources said the candidates in three more villages may withdraw their nominations.
 
 The BJP leadership has been insisting that the polls are futile as the panchayats will have no relevance once the villages are merged with the Pune limits which will look after the development here. 
 
 NCP leaders are keen to prove the party’s dominance before the merger. “Elections can be held in these villages as the merger proposal is not final. The villages have seen a lot of infrastructural development. There should a body to look after daily issues. BJP leaders were looking forward to take the credit for the merger proposal. Chief minister   has shown keen interest in the proposal to extend the party’s base. NCP is well aware of BJP’s moves,” sources in NCP said.
 
 Political observers said the NCP has a strong base in many villages going to the polls and a win would give it an upper hand whether the merger proposal works or fails. These villages have a huge population and NCP is attempting to secure its voter base before the merger decision, they added.
