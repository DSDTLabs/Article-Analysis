LUDHIANA: Fire engulfed the store of a dyeing factory in   village on the outskirts of the city on Friday evening, following a blast in the chemical cans. After getting information about the incident, a fire tender reached the spot and controlled the flames in about an hour.

 Giving details,  , senior hawaldar at   fire station, said that they got a call at around 4pm from the dyeing factory about a fire in the store. He, along with two firemen and a driver, rushed to the spot with a fire tender, but by that time, the factory staff were using their resources to control the fire.
 
 Fire department officials said there were blasts in two cans containing chemicals used for dyeing, which resulted in a fire in the factory’s open area. While factory workers were using water to douse the fire, after firemen reached the spot, they used foam, as it was dangerous to use water to put off such a type of fire caused by chemicals.
 
 Harish Chander said that by 6pm, they had controlled the fire, and had asked factory authorities to isolate the cans in which the blast took place. Fire officials said even as the cans were stored in store rooms, sometimes they go off due to the high pressure that develops in them.
 
 Factory manager   told fire officials they had adopted all safety measures while storing the chemicals. Chander said: “Luckily, there was no loss of human life in the incident, and not much damage to the factory’s infrastructure either.”
