NEW DELHI: Congress President   today gave an 'F' grade report card to the Modi government on the "subject" of agriculture in poll-bound Karnataka.

 There has been no contribution from the Centre to the Congress-led government's Rs 8,500 crore contribution in farm loan waivers, Gandhi said on Twitter.
 
 Farmers have also suffered due to the prime minister's crop insurance scheme in which insurance companies have made huge profits, Gandhi added.
 
 He also said that there has been no MSP (minimum support price) plus 50 per cent for farmers of Karnataka as promised by the Modi regime.
