Varun Dhawan, who plays the twin roles of Raja and Prem in David Dhawan’s ' ' — a modern-day version of the Salman Khan-starrer 'Judwaa' (1997) — had to put in double the effort to prep for the project. 
The actor underwent six months of rigorous training with Kuldeep Shashi for the movie’s stunt sequences that are choreographed by Anal Arasu. Seems, the climax alone took seven days’ prep. Varun perfected eight types of kicks, which have all been used in the Sajid Nadiadwla-produced film. He says, “Vivan Bhatena (he plays the antagonist) and I have worked very hard on the action scenes. Apart from a sequence of me fighting four muggers in a bus and a long cycle chase, Vivan and I have a massive fight scene in which he looks double my size. He is very good at action and it was great shooting with him.”
 With the movie’s trailer and songs already piquing the audience’s interest,the makers are confident about its run at the box office. 
 '  2', produced by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment Pvt Ltd, releases on September 29.
