Even in the PM’s home state,  , only 4% surrendered the subsidy.
 
 The number of people surrendering LPG subsidy had crossed 1 crore in 2016, but since then, only another 4 lakh have surrendered in two years. A petroleum ministry official told TOI that the government expects the number of customers surrendering subsidy to go up as the customer base expands. There are 26 crore LPG customers, of which 25.7 crore are in the domestic category, but only 21.9 crore of these are active customers. About 44.4% of domestic customers have double bottle connections. LPG coverage estimated on the basis of active domestic connections is around 79.2% of all households.
