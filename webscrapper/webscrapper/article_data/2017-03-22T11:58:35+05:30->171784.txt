PATNA: The   members stalled the proceedings in the legislative council on Tuesday over the non-payment of post-matriculation scholarship to the students belonging to backward and extremely backward classes, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe, forcing the chair to adjourn the House till lunch.
 
    raised the issue before the question hour and the opposition members trooped into the well and raised slogans against the government. Opposition leader   said around six lakh students were suffering because of non-payment of scholarship to them. “Earlier, the students were given up to Rs1 lakh, which was reduced to Rs75,000 and then to Rs15,000 last year. Now that also has been stopped,” said SuMo, adding that education minister Ashok Choudhary talked about development of Dalits but, in reality, the government was against them. To this,   asked, “This government talks of development, but what are they doing now?”
  
  Later, talking to media persons, SuMo said many students pursuing engineering, medical, polytechnic and management degrees had to leave their courses midway because they could not pay their fees. He cited the example of   in Bhubaneswar where students from Bihar threatened to commit suicide as the government had not given them stipend.
  
  “From 2016-17, the situation has further deteriorated as the newly enrolled students have not been given even a single penny. Those who had taken admission earlier are given Rs15,000, which again is not sufficient to pay the fees. The government is now saying they would give the students credit card, which is not the right thing to replace the scholarship as credit cards are nothing but loan,” he said.
  
  Citing 2015-16 data, SuMo said 3.75 lakh students belonging to EBCs were given Rs370 crore, which was reduced to Rs128 crore in 2016-17. He also said frauds had misused the scholarship and, instead of arresting the culprits, the government banned the scholarship.
