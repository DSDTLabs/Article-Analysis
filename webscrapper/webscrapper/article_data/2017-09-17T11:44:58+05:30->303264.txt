SHILLONG: Amid speculation that the   will field fresh candidates for the coming  , five   have not taken application forms to seek party tickets, with Friday having been the last day to collect the form.

 The legislators who did not take the application forms are former deputy chief minister   from  , suspended Congress legislator and chief executive member (CEM) of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC), PN Syiem (Mawsynram), Pre-stone Tynsong (Pynursla), Sniawbhalang Dhar (Narti-ang) and Ngaitlang Dhar (Umroi).
 
 “This implies that these fi-ve Congress legislators will not seek re-election from the party,” a party functionary sa-id.
 
 The Congress had already dissolved the block committees represented by Rowell, Tynsong, and the Dhar brothers with a plan to field fresh candidates. Earlier in August, Prestone Tynsong and Sni-awbhalang Dhar were dropped from the state cabinet for ‘anti-party activities’.
