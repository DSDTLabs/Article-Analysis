New Delhi: With cameras and binoculars in their hands along with a checklist of birds found in NCR, hundreds of birders set out early morning on Saturday to take part in the 7th edition of the Delhi   race. The aim of the   for the participating groups was to record the most number of species in a day, with teams heading out to several different locations to record the elusive species.

 This year’s edition saw over 15 teams take part – each comprising of nearly 20 birders and a captain leading them. Teams were handed a list of 481 different bird species which have been recorded in NCR and the teams need to capture the bird on camera and note their names down. 
 
 “From 6am to 7pm, teams covered different locations across NCR which included  ,  , Mangar village, Sohna wetlands and Surajpur among other locations. Each team was led by an expert captain to ensure that the birds are correctly identified,” said  , organizer and captain of one of the teams.
 
 The bird race is held twice every year, once in February and the other in November. According to the rules, each team must have at least 3 birders with no limit set on the maximum number of birders. “It is held when the birds start arriving in Delhi and when the migratory birds are about to leave,” said Singh.
 
 Birder Jaswinder Waraich led one of the groups that explored Surajpur, Okhla and Yamuna Khadar, sighting a total of 154 species. According to him, Okhla turned out to be particularly fruitful compared to last year.
 
 “The area has certainly seen an improvement in terms of birds being sighted in such an environment. Among the notable sightings included the laggar falcon, the peregrine falcon, white browed fantail and a grey-headed canary flycatcher. We also spotted a desert wheatear, dunlin and sand lark,” said Waraich.
 
 The lists will be submitted by each team on Saturday and the results are expected to come out on Sunday evening.
