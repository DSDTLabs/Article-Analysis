 who is promoting his upcoming film, ‘Rangoon’ has been quite busy lately but that is definitely not keeping the actor from treating his fans with a regular dose of his whereabouts. The actor recently took to   to post two goofy videos using   filters and they are hilarious!
 
  
  
 His villainous laughter with the quirky filter in the first video will leave you grinning from ear to ear. The second video is rather adorable – in this cutesy video, Shahid used the girly filter with a pink bow tied on his head and blowing heart bubbles as he is seen crooning ‘Bloody Hell’ from ‘Rangoon’. Cute, don’t you think?
