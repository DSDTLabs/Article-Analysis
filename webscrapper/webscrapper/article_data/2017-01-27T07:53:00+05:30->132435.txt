GURUGRAM:: As is now almost a norm when it rains, several areas reeled under   lasting around five hours. Residents in DLF city, South City and sectors 3, 5, 6, 15, 21, 23 and 25 were the worst hit. The discom, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), faced people’s wrath for doing a shoddy job.

 “Power supply snapped around 11am on Thursday, and it was resumed four hours later. When I rang up DHBVN officials, they just hemmed and hawed and blamed the private power firm,” said Colonel Umed Singh (retired), president, RWA, Sector 21.
 
 Earlier this month, DHBVN drew much criticism after TOI reported on January 7 that the private firm, Sandhya and Company, which has been assigned the task of maintenance of power lines, often failed to check outages after rains. “The private firm is given Rs 52 lakh every month, and this is what the city gets in return,” said Mukesh Bhayana, general secretary, All Haryana Power Corporation Workers Union. In Sector 23, outages continued from 1pm till evening while in Sector 3,5 and 6, the supply was disrupted after a tree fell near Mother Dairy.
 
 SDO DLF city Kuldeep Nehra said the supply was resumed in most areas after an 11 kV axial bunch cable, that developed snags at six places , was repaired.
