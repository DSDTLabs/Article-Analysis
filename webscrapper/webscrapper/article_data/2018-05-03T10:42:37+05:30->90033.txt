 PANCHKULA: Even as the first round of admission under Section 134-A of the Haryana Education Rules in   district is over, the officials are still not aware of the number of seats for EWS (Economical weaker section) and   students that have been filled in private schools so far. 
 
 As per the Act, 10 % of the seats are to be allotted to poor students from Class II to class XII in private schools. For Class I, 25% of the seats are reserved for such students under the right to education (RTE) Act.
 
 An admission test under the rule was conducted across the state. Following this, the first phase of admissions was conducted between April 23 to April 26 and the vacant seats are to be filled by May 4. Though the first leg of admissions is completed, the elementary education officials are still struggling to keep a record of the filled and vacant seats in the district.
 
  If seats remain vacant even after May 4, the private schools will have to submit a vacancy list to the concerned district level committee on May 14.
 
 Urmila  , deputy elementary education officer, Panchkula, said, "At present, I have no such list. I will get the exact numbers only after I get the list from the block education officers once they finalize the number of filled and vacant seats."
