After delivering hits like Gentleman, Indraganti’s next flick starring   and   seems to be an all-Telugu cast. 

  This includes the two female leads,   and   which is a rare feat considering the fact that all our star heroines are imports. Quite an interesting move! Mohana Krishna’s film Ashta Chamma too was an all telugu cast and incidentally was also Avasarala’s debut film. 
 
  The movie which was announced recently will be a romantic comedy reportedly.
