When an   turns filmmaker without ever having had any ties to the industry earlier, it is the passion towards the craft that drives him. That has pretty much been the case for  , a self-taught director, who is now awaiting the release of his second directorial,  .
“I was quite the movie buff when I was still a student and aspired to work in the film industry. In fact, after I graduated and began working as an engineer, I did look out for opportunities to assist established directors. While that didn’t work out, my friends who knew about my interests in filmmaking suggested that I start by making short films. I made a couple of shorts, after which I wanted to get into the big league with a full-on commercial flick. That break happened with  , which did well at the box office,” says Mallikarjun.
 It has, however, been more than three years since his debut feature and one wonders what caused the delay. “I could have made another commercial flick, but my aim is to make films that appeal to all audiences. I have always been inspired by director Puttanna Kanagal and the novelty he brought into each of his films. As a filmmaker, I also want to tell stories that are fresh for Kannada audiences and will have them wondering how the narrative pans out,” says Mallikarjun.
 Rangbirangi, he adds, is one such attempt. The film, which stars a bunch of newcomers, is inspired by his experiences in engineering college and is a mix of real life and cinematic liberties. “The story revolves around four guys, all of whom are in love with the same girl, but they don’t know each other. I saw this often in college, when multiple guys would tell me that they fancy a certain girl, but none of them would know the others. I was often the common factor listening to all their stories,” he explains.
