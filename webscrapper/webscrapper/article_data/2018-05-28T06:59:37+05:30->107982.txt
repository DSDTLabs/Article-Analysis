 Quoting the 2011 census, Kumar said 89% of population in state lives in rural areas and 76% are dependent on agriculture. “Better roads in tolas and villages will provide connectivity to farmers and help them sell their produces,” he said.

It has been observed that farmers buy tractors and other heavy vehicles after construction of roads,” he added.
 
 The CM asked the rural works department to plant saplings along the newly constructed roads and ensure their proper maintenance. “It is wrong on the part of the rural works department to blame the forest department for lack of maintenance of trees along the roads. There should be better coordination between the two departments,” the CM said. He stressed on use of new technology to bring down construction cost.
