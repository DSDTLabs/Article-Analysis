ALLAHABAD: The recent   of high-value notes and the upcoming state Assembly elections have claimed an unlikely victim – the seer community at   premises. The currency ban has taken a toll on donations, forcing saints to cut down on ‘havans’ and ‘bhandaras’. 

 Short on cash, many seers have been compelled to cut down the number of servings of food to kalpwasis and devotees. 
 
 Unlike last year, when saints had organised elaborate havans to pay tribute to soldiers martyred in Pathankot terrorist attacks, the Siachen avalanche and many other social causes, the seers have limited their activities to routine rituals. 
 
 Secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Dandi Chowk Sanyasi Samiti, Swami Brahmashram said, “There has been drastic cut in cash donations after the cap on cash withdrawals. Till recently, traders used to cite demonetisation as the reason but now they claim that they have been forced to scale back contributions due to assembly polls.”
 
 One of the seers’ group, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Businessmen are donating to political parties instead of doing social service by organising community feasts at the mela.” 
 
 Mahamandleswar Swami Manohar Das said, “It is believed that ‘khichdi‘ served to poor or devotees in   festival at Sangam area helps people get rid of all their sins. Till last year, dozens of such bhandaras were organised in the mela area alone but this year only few were seen.”
 
 A retired junior engineer turned ascetic, Baba Amritnath who along with his followers has been serving khichdi at Mela since past one decade is also feeling the pinch of demonetisation and polls. “This time we have very little fund to continue the khicdi distribution programme for the 42-day long Magh Mela,” said one of his followers.
