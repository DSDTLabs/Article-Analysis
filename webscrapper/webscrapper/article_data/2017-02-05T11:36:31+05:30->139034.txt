AHMEDABAD: “At a  , I was shocked to find that children of a certain caste were made to sit separately at mid-day meal time. Teachers conceded that if children of all castes were made to sit together to eat, many parents would stop sending their wards to school in protest,” said Mahesh Singh, director of District   Project (DPEP), Gujarat.

 That this and uglier practices continue at schools in rural Gujarat to this day and age emerged as thousands of teachers, principals and government officials brainstormed about ‘Improving the quality of primary education: A collective responsibility’.
 
  The ‘Chintan Shibir’ for education was held at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar on Saturday. Some 5,000 personnel associated with education took part in the shibir, after which officers, teachers and principals had group discussions.
 
 Many teachers confessed the liquor menace is rampant in villages and the children of alcoholics became victims, as they were not sent to school. “Many kids do not make to school as their parents are addicted to liquor. This problem is messing with the future of young students,” many teachers said.
 
 This prompted the chief of state police’s monitoring cell Hasmukh Patel to declare that any complaint about liquor by teachers would be given top priority.
 
 Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said: “The   is meant to find why the quality of education is deteriorating in the state. One reason was the ‘no detention’ policy, where all students were promoted irrespective of their performance. We urged the central government to reverse this. Students in classes 3,5 and 8 will be retained if they do not fare well in exams,” said Chudasama
