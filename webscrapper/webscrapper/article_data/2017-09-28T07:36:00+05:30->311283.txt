Chandigarh: Construction of internal streets in Kajheri, re-carpeting of city roads, disposal of booths constructed under the bridge market in Sector 17, sectors 17 and 22 subway, Sector 39 and Mauli Jagran on leasehold basis are some of the agenda items to be discussed during the monthly house meeting of the municipal corporation (MC) on Friday.

 Out of 10 items, four form the supplementary agenda.
 
 The issue of disposing of hundreds of booths and commercial establishments is one of the crucial agenda to be taken up again. It could not be discussed in the last meeting owing to paucity of time.
 
 “We have been losing crores of rupees due to non-disposal of properties of the MC for past many years. It is a good sources of income for us. We must be able to dispose of such commercial establishments and spend the money on development of the city,” said one of the municipal councillors.
 
 A few members of the house in the previous meetings had pointed out that properties should be sold instead of being given on rent. Many felt that the civic body should allot these properties in a freehold manner instead of leasehold.
 
 The issue related to the property tax of the commercial properties of villages will figure in the supplementary agenda. Since shops and other commercial establishment are either not paying the tax or paying little, the MC is eyeing the segment to enhance its revenue.
 
 The agenda related to road works and construction and concrete related works will also be part of meeting.
