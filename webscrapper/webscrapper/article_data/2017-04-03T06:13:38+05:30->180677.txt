KOLKATA:   youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday, in his first public rally after he was seriously injured in an accident more than five months ago, said people in   had faith in chief minister  .

 “Even if all political parties come together against Trinamool in the panchayat polls, nobody can defeat us. People are with us. There is no alternative to   Banerjee in Bengal. People have rejected the unholy nexus of CPM and Congress,” he said at a massive rally at the SDO Ground in Diamond Harbour.
 
 The Diamond Harbour MP claimed the Centre was arm-twisting the state by stopping payments for welfare schemes. After a ‘near-death experience’ five months ago, Abhishek termed Sunday’s rally the beginning of his second innings. He alleged that the Centre was not paying for MGNREGA, Integrated Child Development Scheme and midday meal schemes in West Bengal. The state government, on the other hand, had done commendable work in food security, education and health, he said.
 
 Pointing at BJP’s repeated raking up of issues like Saradha and Narada, he said Trinamool was not afraid of central agencies. “They cannot scare us with such intimidation. If they want to attack Mamata Banerjee, the people of the state will give a fitting reply. They have already witnessed that in the assembly polls,” Abhishek said at the meeting organized by Trinamool   Yuva Morcha.
 
 Criticizing the Centre for going slow in unearthing black money, he said: “We had promised we would return land in Singur. We have fulfilled our promise. How many promises did BJP fulfil?”
 
 Abhishek also came down hard on BJP state leaders, alleging their involvement in child trafficking.
 
 Trinamool secretary general Partha Chaterjee echoed the CM’s remarks from a day earlier and asked party workers to meet people at the grassroots level. “Panchayat elections are due and we have to strengthen the organization in the face of opposition attacks,” he said.
