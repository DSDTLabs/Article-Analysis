AHMEDABAD: Meena Rathod, the wife of life-term convict in the 2002   massacre—Kalu Harisinh Rathod alias Navab — moved   and requested it to send her husband back to jail because he had jumped bail.

 The woman wanted her husband to go back to jail because she was tortured and physically abused by the convict. 
 
 She claimed that Navab was released for a week but did not surrender back to jail authorities even after his bail period had ended.
 
 The high court, however, rejected her request on the grounds that if the convict “after being enlarged on temporary bail has not surrendered to the jail authorities, it is for the concerned authorities to take necessary action in that regard”. 
 
 Hence the court cannot issue directions to take Navab into custody as prayed for by his wife.
 
 Special prosecutor   assured the court that he would convey the matter to the concerned authorities for the necessary action. However, Navab is still out, 10 days after these proceedings.
 
 Interestingly, Meena had filed a petition in the HC requesting that Navab be given temporary bail because their son was unwell. The HC ordered his release for a week, so he could look after his ailing son. However, Navab did not return after the week.
 
 According to Meena’s advocate Harshit Karathia, Navab not only did not surrender before the jail authorities, but stayed at home in Naroda. 
 
 He began harassing his wife and son and finally drove both of them out of the house. Rendered shelterless, the wife had to move the HC to send her husband back to jail following his prolonged stay outside.
 
 A similar event took place in February last year, when Navab was released on bail temporarily by the high court for his own treatment. 
 
 He began harassing his wife so much that she approached the court for the cancellation of her husband’s bail.
