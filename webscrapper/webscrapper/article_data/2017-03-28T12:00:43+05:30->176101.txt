BHOPAL: Another portion of the historic   collapsed here on Monday. Debris from the palace fell on the   during rush hour but thankfully no injuries were reported. 

 The privately owned Shaukat Mahal is one of the finest examples of  , but it’s in a dilapidated state. Two years ago, heritage conservationists anguished by the demolition of the facade of the 187-year-old Shaukat Mahal, demanded restoration of the palace.
 
 The facade was pulled down despite cries for its restoration. BMC claimed it was a precautionary move to avoid the risk of parts of the structure collapsing on traffic on BRTS corridor and injuring people. Another section of the 18th century palace was seen falling off from the other end of the palace towards Moti Masjid. A section of the balcony of the palace fell on the BRTS corridor around 2pm.
 
 Shaukat Mahal is unprotected and there are over two dozen families living in the area. A massive portion was bought from a dealer some two decades ago. However, the owner’s family refused to vacate, citing internal family disputes, say sources.
 
 Unwilling to care for heritage restoration, the civic body’s then chief engineer suggested to residents of Shaukat Mahal in April 2015 that a huge crack had developed at the entrance to the 18th century palace. It cannot be restored, hence the portion must be torn down, he said. Two years on, as the government plans to spend over Rs 10 crore for restoration of adjacent Sadar Manzil, Shaukat Mahal still awaits a healing touch.
