NEW DELHI: The capital finally has its own   that can be used to travel on Delhi   as well as public transport buses. While the facility, launched on Monday, will currently be available on 250 — 200 DTC and 50 cluster —  , the government hopes to cover the entire network by April.

 Under the project, which puts Delhi in the rank of London, Hong Kong and Singapore, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) will accept metro smart cards for paying fare on their buses.
 
 Launching the pilot project, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said public transport users would be able to seamlessly travel between   and buses. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot, DMRC managing director Mangu Singh, DTC’s chairman-cum-managing director Sandeep Kumar and Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash were also present at the event.
 
 The 250 buses — 50 cluster buses of Banda Bahadur Marg cluster bus depot and 100 DTC buses each of Raj Ghat depot-I and Rohini depot-I — have electronic ticketing machines (ETMs) equipped with secure access module chips, allowing them to access metro cards. Electronic boards installed in these buses will inform passengers about the availability of this facility. A large number of these buses start from places close to Kashmere Gate ISBT.
 
 While commuters will now have to recharge their cards at metro stations, the government is planning to provide smart cards at all ISBTs, railway stations and Delhi Tourism Tourist Information centres.
