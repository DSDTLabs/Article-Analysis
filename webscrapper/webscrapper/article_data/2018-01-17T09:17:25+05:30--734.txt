VADODARA: Disappointed with being ignored for the ongoing  , Baroda cricketer   has expressed his wish to play for another team. Pathan has written a letter to the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) and sought NOC to play for another association.

 The BCA managing committee that is meeting on Wednesday will take decision about Pathan's request. "Pathan sent a letter during Uttarayan seeking NOC to play for another team in next season. He has said that he is not getting opportunity to play in Baroda and that his professional abilities can be utilized better in another team," said Snehal Parikh, BCA secretary (in charge).
 
 Pathan was made Baroda Ranji team captain this season but he was dropped unceremoniously after two marches. The selectors had said that they wanted to younger and fit players to play for the team but the decision hadn't gone down well with Pathan who felt that his performance wasn't the reason behind him being dropped. The selectors ignored Pathan for the   T20Trophy too.
