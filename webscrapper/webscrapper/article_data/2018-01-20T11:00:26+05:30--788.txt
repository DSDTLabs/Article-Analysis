TRICHY: Sleuths of the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption ( ) on Friday arrested the commissioner of   corporation, M  , 58, for accepting a bribe of Rs 75,000 from a man for fixing the tax on his vacant plot. A 54-year-old   functionary who brokered the deal was also nabbed. 

 The arrest took place at the chamber of the commissioner in the Thanjavur corporation office in the afternoon. The police team caught Varadharaj and the tout, P Nagaraj of  , red-handed when they were receiving the chemical-laced cash from M  , 60. 
 
 The complainant, a retired railway employee of  , said that he was made to run from pillar to post by corporation officials for the past four months after he approached them to get the tax calculated for his 15,509 sqft vacant plot in   street. Later, an AIADMK functionary, Nagaraj, introduced himself as the tout of the commissioner and offered to get the work done. The commissioner allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh as the cost of the land was high. Sambandam struck a bargain and agreed to pay Rs 75,000 to get the task done. 
 
 Later, he had a change of mind and decided not to cough up the bribe. Sambandam lodged a complaint with the DVAC on Thursday following which the police decided to lay a trap. They sent him with the currency to be handed over to commissioner. An unsuspecting Nagaraj took him to the commissioner and received the chemical-laced money from the man when the DVAC sleuths trooped in. 
 
 Both the commissioner as well as the tout were sent to prison after being produced in court. 
 
 Incidentally, Varadharaj has landed in trouble with only a month to go for his superannuation.
