PATNA: If everything goes according to plan, 30   buses will be operated in the state capital soon under the Smart City Plan. The move is also aimed at easing traffic congestion and curbing air pollution in the city.

  secretary   said the proposal for electric buses had been forwarded to the Union transport ministry for approval. “The buses will not only help curb air pollution, but also minimise sound pollution,” Agarwal said.
 
 According to a senior transport official, the cost of one electric bus is over Rs 1 crore. “Electric buses are comparatively more expensive than a CNG bus, which costs around Rs 85 lakh. However, the operational and maintenance cost of an electric bus is much lower than a CNG bus. If   gets the approval to run electric buses, it will join the ranks of Los Angeles, Toronto, Chicago and New York which use electric buses as public transport. If electric buses become the norm, they will also reduce the demand for diesel fuel,” the official added. 
 
 Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor said 30 electric buses would run in the city under the intelligent management segment of the Smart City Plan. “For intelligent traffic management system, 1,100 CCTV cameras will be installed in various localities of the city to catch traffic rule violators. A command and control system centre will also be set up to manage the CCTV cameras,” Kishor said. 
 
 Another proposal has been forwarded to the urban development department to increase the number of parking facilities in the city.
 
 Proposals have also been forwarded to the officials concerned for data centre, environmental sensors, variable messaging system, ICT-based solid waste management system, e-governance and e-municipality.
