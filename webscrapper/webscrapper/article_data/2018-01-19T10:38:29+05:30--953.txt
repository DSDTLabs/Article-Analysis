LUDHIANA: Despite several attempts, the officials of the civic department have failed to fetch any response from the tenants over buying  , which were being used for   purposes. Hence, the officials are now planning to take the help of ex-councillors and MLAs, who would convince the tenants to purchase the shops where they are running their businesses for more than 20 years.

 Earlier, the municipal corporation (MC) had issued a notification in this regard in November 2017 with an idea to recover old pending dues from the tenants, who were neither leaving these properties nor increasing the rentals. Some of the tenants were not even paying the rents, despite nominal amounts fixed by the  . These tenants have time till March 31, 2018 to clear their outstandings.
 
 The tenants will have to pay 25% of the collector rate of the area. One fourth payment will have to be given within one month and the rest of the payment is to be paid in three annual installments. If an applicant pays the entire amount within 30 days, then an additional 5% rebate would be given.
 
 Meanwhile, the officials have said that despite visiting various markets a lot of time, the task now seems difficult to be concluded as these shops have been further given on rent by the main tenants. “It becomes tough to trace the real tenants in such cases,” the officials said.
 
 The MC has a total of 631 rental properties in the city. Out of these, most of the properties are over 20 years old. The department has to recover around Rs 4.5 crores in rentals from the tenants.
 
 The secretary of the civic body   said that they tried hard to convince but the strategy did not work. “Hence, we have decided to take help of the political leaders and organize special camps in these areas to convince the tenants,” said Sekhon.
