DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday alleged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has indulged in corruption. The saffron party's allegation came after Kejriwal removed   from his Cabinet.

 Soon after his removal, Mishra hinted that he was removed because he had apprised Kejriwal of his intentions to expose the names who were delaying the   probe in the Delhi Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).
 
 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari told ANI that the BJP has been saying repeatedly that Delhi AAP government is fully involved in scams. "By removing Kapil Mishra from the cabinet, they (AAP) proved that the one who will talk about scams will go out," said Tiwari. The BJP leader said that now it has been proved that Kejriwal himself involved in scams.
