LUCKNOW: The chief minister's home district,  , is set to get an environmental makeover.

 The UP government's environment and forest department plans to rejuvenate and refine the district's rivers and lakes and put Gorakhpur on the eco-tourism map, as it has huge tracts of terai forest. The environment directorate will begin by commissioning a study of   and rivers   and   that flow through Gorakhpur. It will be the first of its kind study in UP by a government department. The directorate has called for expression of interest to choose an agency through open bidding.
 
 Ramgarh is a natural lake which, till 1970s, was full of water in an area of about 723 hectares. Now, it has decreased to about 670 hectares, as a study by the Union ministry of environment and forests had found. The depth of the lake has also decreased from about 4.5 metres in 1990s to about 3.5 metres now.
 
 The study might cost the directorate around Rs 20 lakh.
 
 “The agency that the directo rate selects will decide the funds required. We already have a budget for environmental studies so funds are not a concern,“ said a source.
 
 For the past few years, the directorate has been receiving complaints against increasing industrial pollution by paper mills, distilleries and sugar units on the banks of Rapti and Ami rivers.
 
 “Before   became the CM, he had been raising the cause of the lake and rivers in Gorakhpur. He also raised the matter in   as an MP. The directorate, therefore, thought of launching the study from his land,“ said a source.
 
 The study will be qualitative and quantitative to assess deterioration in water quality due to pollution and volume of effluents being discharged in the river at critical points. The study would also suggest remedial measures.
