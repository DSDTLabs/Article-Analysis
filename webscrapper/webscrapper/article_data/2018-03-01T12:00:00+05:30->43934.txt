AHMEDABAD: The   ( ) in the state was 112 per one lakh live births as on December 31, 2017. 

  The figure was 172 per one lakh live births in 2001. The state government, in a reply to the question of   MLA  , stated that the MMR has dropped by about 60 per one lakh live births. 
 
 The Socio-economic review for 2017-18 says: "The health infrastructure and services are being constantly improved and enhanced to increase access, availability, and affordability of healthcare and medical treatment in the state. 
 
 The birth rate has declined from 24.9 (SRS 2001) to 20.1(SRS 2016). The death rate has decreased from 7.8 (SRS 2001) to 6.1 (SRS 2016). 
 
 The infant mortality rate (IMR) has come down significantly from 60 (SRS 2001) to 30 (SRS 2016). And the maternal mortality rate (MMR) has decreased significantly from 202 (SRS 1999-01) to 112 (SRS 2011-13).
 
 However, the CAG report of 2016 had pointed out that the lack of facilities in ICU and non-availability of regular specialist doctors resulted in poor quality of maternal healthcare services in hospitals. The report said these problems needed to be fixed to achieve the goal of reducing maternal and infant mortality.
 
 The CAG report, 'General and Social Sector for the year ended March 2015', had stated that the facility of day-and -night shelter for mothers of neonates was not available in many hospitals. 
 
 In all test-checked district hospitals (DHs), there was shortage of important equipment such as infantmeter, spot lamp, portable X-ray machine, cardiac monitor, among others. Further, equipment for disinfection such as electronic fumigator, disinfectant sprayer, formalin vaporizer were not available either in any of the test-checked DHs.
 
 The CAG recommended that the government strengthen maternal and child health departments at all hospitals by deploying specialist doctors and providing requisite equipment and adequate number of beds, to prevent the stage of advanced deterioration which ultimately leads to higher IMR and maternal mortality. Officials agreed with CAG recommendations.
