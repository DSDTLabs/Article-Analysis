Dev goes off to sleep with Golu. He wakes up and sees a lot of missed calls. He rushes to Sona's house thinking Soha must be waiting. Sona comes out and scolds Dev for being late.
 
  Next day, Dev is playing with Suhana. Sourav comes and asks Dev for a favour. He asks him to convince Sona to help Ronita in getting ready.
  
  Bejoy and Asha are talking. Bejoy tells her that he understands that Dev is here for Soha and both of them should help Dev and Sona reunite.
  
  Asha is busy with all the preparations. Sona has to go to Ronita's place. She sees Dev and asks him to help her. He reminds Sona that it is her last day at her house as she and Soha will be going to Dev's house for a week now.
  
  
 
  
  Sourav is nervous about the wedding and Dev makes him feel comfortable. He asks Dev about Sona and on the other hand, Ronita asks the same question from Sona. The two are speechless.
  
  The wedding rituals start. Sourav and Ronita tell each other how nervous they were feeling before and Dev and Sona helped them. Dev and Sonakshi look at each other and recall their wedding.
