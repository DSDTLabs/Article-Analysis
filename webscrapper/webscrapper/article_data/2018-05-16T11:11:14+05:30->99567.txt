KOCHI:   Anavatti moved to Kochi 32 years ago from   in   but the elections brought him closer to the home state than ever before. He and his family are closely following the political drama that the 2018 state elections have unveiled following the fractured verdict.

 Srikant said that the elections were important to him because he is still rooted to his home state and many of his family members are still based there.
 
 “Compared to the rural areas, the voter turnout in the state capital, Bengaluru was poor,” said Srikant, who is rooting for a   government in Karnataka.
 
 For S  , a BJP supporter, feels that   played divisive politics by playing the Lingayat card. “I am from the Lingayat community and I feel that the Congress resorted to third class divisive politics by playing the Lingayat card months before the election. During the campaign, politics in general was shamelessly divisive making it painful to watch from here,” said Gangadhar.
 
 Gangadhar has been closely following the election and his family and friends, got together at his home at Ayyappankavu in the morning. “With either party not having a majority to form the government, the elections results made us tense. In the morning, I was with family and friends watching the news. By afternoon, I had to leave for work but my eyes were glued to the news channels,” said Gangadhar.
 
 Though by Monday afternoon Janatha Dal (Secular) and INC had announced a post-poll coalition to form the government, many were of the view that the situation is still fluid.
 
 “In the past, Amit Shah has shown that he is a very canny politician and there is no telling how he would manage to form a coalition out of nothing. We have seen it happen before. I am going to watch it carefully till the end," said a veterinary doctor from Karnataka who has made Kochi home for the past 28 years.
