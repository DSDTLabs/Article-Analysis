MADURAI: The entire higher   system is extremely corrupted and the   government will definitely not act to curb it as politicians are party to it. Therefore it should be investigated thoroughly, said state secretary of People’s Union for Civil Liberties, R  .

 Speaking to TOI, he said that all the appointments made in universities and institutions of higher education in the last nine years were definitely made based on the influence of money. “Corruption has become highly institutionalised and it was more in government-aided colleges, where people just pay the money and get the posts,” he said.
 
 Murali claimed that Rs 7 lakh had to be paid to politicians and then at various levels in the institutions to secure a post. Many postings in colleges are made by eroding all values of higher education and by highly corrupt means, he added.
 
 The recent arrest of the vice-chancellor of   has stoked a plethora of complaints with regard to corruption in the appointments of college and university teachers in Tamil Nadu. It is believed that many aided stream managements, principals, professors, collegiate and university authorities are part of this raving and egregious corruption project in higher education. Overt and covert procedural lapses are being reported in several institutions. Monomaniacal lust for money is rampant and therefore conscientious candidates are sidelined. In this juncture, the silence of the government against these exorbitant corruption charges only exacerbates the already infested educational climate, Murali said.
 
 He demanded the government to constitute a high-level inquiry commission immediately to investigate the appointments made in all universities and colleges of Tamil Nadu and an exhaustive report be submitted within a stipulated period of three months. A public hearing should be held in major cities to garner the grievances and complaints from the affected teachers and other applicants and probe the irregularities in detail, he added.
