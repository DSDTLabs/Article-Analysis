PATNA: Even as the onset of southwest   in Bihar is a fortnight away, a humble bout of showers in Patna exposed the ill- preparedness of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to tackle the waterlogging menace. While several streets were seen water- logged, others had ditches and muddy potholes.

 PMC sources say only 60% of the monsoon preparedness works, including cleaning of drainage and manholes, have been completed. This means the remaining 40% of the works has to be completed in the next 10 days, else the residents would be forced to face the infamous waterlogging scenario in monsoon.
 
 “The pre-monsoon work is underway in different localities of the city. Most of the works related to desilting of canal is done. work is underway on a project entailing an estimated outlay of Rs175 crore and likely to be finished by June-end,” Patna mayor Sita Sahu told this newspaper on Tuesday. 
 
 Admitting the delay in pre-monsoon preparedness, Sahu said, “The initial deadline was June 15, but the PMC decided to extend it till June 30. However, around 60% of the work is completed.” 
 
 She said weekly inspection would be held and a final review of the work would be done before the deadline.
 
 Complaining about the accumulation of water on streets, city resident Ashish Jain rued the uneven and dug-up roads. “The chances of accidents increase on waterlogged roads. It’s the story of every year when commuters have to suffer from water stagnation on roads during monsoon. No prompt actions are taken by authorities even after facing the same every year. All the big claims and plans of PMC are exposed as soon as the monsoon arrives.”
 
 Apart from waterlogging, another problem that pedestrians have to suffer from is the mixing of rainwater with sewage water, which causes serious sanitation issues. One spell of rain and these roads become slushy. It becomes difficult to even walk,” said Shaivya Shukla, a resident of Boring Road area.
