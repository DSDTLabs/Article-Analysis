So I kept seeking myself in you till the point where I completely lost myself into you and you completely gave away all of you. But is it true? That I never loved you? I just sought myself in you, If I loved, then it wouldn’t have been about ‘the seeking’ and it wouldn’t have been about me, it wouldn’t have been about you either! It would just be about love No seeking, no me and no you!”
