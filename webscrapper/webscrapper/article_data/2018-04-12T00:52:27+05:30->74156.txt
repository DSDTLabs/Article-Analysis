Salem/Erode: Thousands of Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) cadres were arrested for attempting to hold rail roko in Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Namakkal and Erode on Wednesday.

 In Salem, the protest was led by state president G K Mani. More than 1,000 cadres gathered in front of Salem railway junction to stage rail roko. When they tried to enter the junction, the city police and railway protection force (RPF) personnel prevented them entering the junction.
