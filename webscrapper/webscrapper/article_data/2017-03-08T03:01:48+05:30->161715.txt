At present, school bus fees range from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 a month, depending on the school. “It has become difficult to provide affordable bus services because of the escalating costs. Insurance is going to be more expensive, the cost of buses has increased by about 20% and so are RTO fees and fines,” said Anil Garg, president of the association. He added that the costs to follow new safety rules such as installing GPS and CCTV cameras on board have added to the expense. “These electronics are expensive, but important for the safety of students,” he added.
 
 The association will levy an additional 5% hike on school buses that cross toll nakas. “We have been seeking toll exemption for some time now, but the government is paying no heed,” said Garg.
