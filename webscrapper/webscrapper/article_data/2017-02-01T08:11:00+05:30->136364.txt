GURUGRAM:   has cancelled the allotment of two plots in Gurgaon after their owners were found to be possessing multiple plots under the reserved category in its sectors. The   authority has also recommended filing of FIRs against the two accused in the  .

 Officials said Huda has also prepared a list of plot holders in connection with the scam, wherein some people in connivance with its officials had managed to acquire more than one plot under the reserved category by giving false information. The urban development authority had initiated the probe into the scam in the wake of an order by the  . In November 2016, Huda had issued notices to more than 300 people in Gurgaon for their alleged involvement in the scam.
 
 Officials said the two accused have been identified as Hoshiyar Singh, a resident of Najafgarh, and RC Girdhar, a resident of Chandigarh. “After receiving the go-ahead from the chief administrator, we had carried out the probe. Now allotment of two plots in Gurgaon has been cancelled,” Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav told TOI on Tuesday. Huda is likely to cancel allotment of several other such plots.
 
 However, SK Sharma, an   activist who had exposed the multiple plot scam, alleged Huda has cited the wrong court order for cancellation of the two plots, which can benefit the accused if they challenge the same in a court of law.
 
 “Huda had cited the order in the case of Dharam Singh vs state of Haryana for cancellation of the plots. Punjab and Haryana HC did not direct cancellation of plot in this case rather ordered lodging of an FIR only,” he said. “Instead of quoting the wrong case, Huda should have cancelled the plots as per its own policy prepared on the direction of HC in August 2015,” he added.
