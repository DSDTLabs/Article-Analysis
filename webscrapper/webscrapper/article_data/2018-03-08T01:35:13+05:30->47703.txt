NEW DELHI: Over 40,000 families of workers of South Delhi Municipal Corporation will soon get cashless health insurance benefits, making the corporation the first out of three civic bodies to adopt such a welfare measure.

 Mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat said on Wednesday that the tender for the new scheme would be executed in next 15 days and all paperwork has been completed. The scheme will, however, be restricted to   employees and will be based on the pay scales of the employees. The benefits will be available in three categories — three lakh, five lakh and seven lakh would start within next two months.
 
 “There will be no capping on the expenses on health services for the employees and their dependents. A limit has been fixed as per scales of the respective employees, but in case of severe illnesses we will take care of all our workers,” Seharawat said.
 
 There are around 42,000 regular employees on the rolls of   and it also engages 15,000 contractual employees. The demand of cashless health card benefits — where the employees and their dependents can seek health care free of cost in the hospitals which will be reimbursed by the corporation funds — has been a long standing demand of employees especially from the sanitation department where workers are exposed to dangerous situations.
 
 Rajendra Mewati, general secretary of the  , said: “The corporation has also announced such scheme in 2013, we will be satisfied only when it actually becomes a reality. So many sanitation workers dies in need of proper health care as they can not afford better hospitals”
