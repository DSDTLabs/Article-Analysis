GADAG/MANGALURU: With state assembly elections just a week away, the war of words between the   and BJP has shown a sharp escalation. On Saturday, Prime Minister   said post elections Congress would turn into a PPP (Punjab, Puducherry and Parivar) party and called Congress anti-women for opposing the triple talaq bill. CM   was quick to retort by calling BJP ‘Prison’, ‘Price Rise’ & ‘Pakoda’ party on Twitter.

 
 Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi released a video titled “Karnataka’s Most Wanted” on his Twitter account demanding answers from Modi over BJP giving tickets to those allegedly involved in corruption, including BJP state president   and Reddy brothers.
 
 The PM, who literally touched the length and breadth of Karnataka (going from Gadag in the North to   in the South) on Saturday, said: “Karnataka Congress ministers have built a tank of corruption and the same is connected to New Delhi by a pipeline. Congress sends money through this pipeline to its high command. If it loses Karnataka, it will just remain as PPP Congress.”
 
 Rahul’s equally hard-hitting video tweet starts by saying: “Dear Modiji, you talk a lot. Problem is, your actions don’t match your words. Here’s a primer on your candidate selection in Karnataka. It plays like an episode of ‘Karnataka’s Most Wanted.” Carrying pictures of BJP leaders, it asks: “When will you speak on your top 11 leaders facing corruption cases?”
