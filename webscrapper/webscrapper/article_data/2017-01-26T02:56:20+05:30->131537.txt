NAVI MUMBAI:   (CR) has asked   to acquire around 3-km long forest area spread over 18 hectares at Gavan station on the   corridor.

 Narendra Patil, CPRO, CR, told TOI on Tuesday that even though they have written several letters, sent reminders and highlighted the forest land clearance to Cidco, they are still waiting.
 
 Sources from Cidco, which is under pressure to complete the entire 26.5-km rail corridor completed by the end of 2018, said that they will get the clearance in some time. “The forest department has raised queries and we are answering them,” they added.
 
 CR sources said that it would take around two and a half years to complete the project after the forest land is acquired and handed over. Keeping a margin of few months for the land issue to get sorted out, the project would be completed by mid-2019.
 
 Cidco sources maintained, “We have fast tracked the case and confident of meeting the 2018 deadline.”
 
 The clear title of the forest stretch would ensure connecting Kharpokar station to Gavan and further on to Ranjanpada. Kharpokar and Gavan are in Ulwe while Ranjanpada is in Dronagiri, said sources.
 
 Cidco and CR have a 67:33 cost sharing participation in the Uran rail link corridor.
 
 It’s been five years since the Uran corridor work started after a green hurdle got sorted out. The forest land issue came up when it was found there were 14 hectares of private forest, comprising two villages of Gavan and Jasai, along with four hectares of government land.
 
 The project was scheduled to be completed in 2016, but land acquisition the issue has extended the deadline to end-2018 or mid-2019.
