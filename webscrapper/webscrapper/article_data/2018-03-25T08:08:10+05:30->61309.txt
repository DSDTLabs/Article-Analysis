VASCO: Members of the   (UTA) on Saturday threatened to retaliate if a   counter, scheduled to be opened at   on Monday, began providing point-to-point taxi services, too.

 Pre-empting a law and order situation, deputy collector  , DySP Sunita Sawant and officials of the RTO, fire department, Vasco police and   (AAI), met with UTA members and their legal advisor, Herculano Dourado, and sought their cooperation in avoiding any untoward incidents.
 
 
 “The operator of the car rental business acquired a counter at the airport through a tender from the AAI. However, when he approached the RTO for permission, he didn’t receive it, following which he moved the high court of Bombay at Goa,” Arondekar said. The high court subsequently gave the RTO two weeks to decide, following which the permission was issued.
 
 The police have been instructed to ensure that law and order is maintained on Monday, when the car rental counter is thrown open.
