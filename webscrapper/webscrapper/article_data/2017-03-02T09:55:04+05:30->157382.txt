 Sources said special security arrangements have been made to ensure his security in the jail ward. “It is comparable to the security we ensured for him the day he was here before making his confessional statement,” said a senior jail official.
 
 Sources said they are waiting for forensic reports before filing the chargesheet in the Akansha murder case. “Udayan has recorded his confessional statement before a local judicial magistrate under CrPC Section 164. He has accepted his guilt in open court. It was he who directed the investigators to the remains of Akansha’s body in Bhopal. Once we get the DNA report confirming that Akansha’s remains were recovered from Udayan’s residence, we will file the chargesheet,” said SP ( ) Sukhendu Hira.
 
 “We need to speak to Akansha’s family and a few people in Bhopal and Delhi to establish Akansha’s movements. We will then consult our legal team,” added another officer.
 
 “The technical analysis of Udayan’s laptop and the mobile phones of Udayan and Akansha is also expected,” said a senior officer.
