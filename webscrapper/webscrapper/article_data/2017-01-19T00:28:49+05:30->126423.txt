Indore: In another horrifying incident of attempted female infanticide, the police and Childline rescued a newborn girl that was thrown behind a Gurudwara at Scheme number 78 near SICA School on Wednesday. The girl child was born only one-and-half hour before she was found wrapped in a blanket which was stuffed in a plastic carry bag. The bag was being dragged away by some dogs. The identity of the perpetrators is still unknown. “Children that were playing on the street saw dogs dragging the plastic bag and informed a passerby who then chased the dogs away and checked the bag. Finding the newborn girl in the plastic bag, Raju, who works as a plumber with IMC, dialed 100 and also called Childline’s helpline number. Since the 108 ambulances were on strike, a police patrolling vehicle brought the baby girl to MY hospital where her treatment began after a check-up,” Shashindra Dubey from childline informed. Doctors said the child weighed 2.7 kg and was born between 12 noon and 1pm on Wednesday. The doctors gave her the needed treatment and said the girl will need to be kept at the hospital for a few days. The incident occurred at around 2pm.
