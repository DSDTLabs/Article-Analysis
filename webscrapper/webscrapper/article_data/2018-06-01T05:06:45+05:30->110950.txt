Mumbai: Fewer people use   now than ever before, but   has issued a warning that this reduction-almost 7% drop in smokers in 18 years-isn't enough to protect people from death and suffering from cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes or stroke. The   report said 27% smoked tobacco in 2000, compared to 20% in 2016. 

 The message delivered on the occasion of World No Tobacco Day on Thursday, holds special significance for India, where tobacco-chewing is a bigger problem than smoking alone. "The global drop in smoking prevalence is in sync with Global Adult Tobacco Survey's (GATS) outcome for India," said Dr  , oral cancer surgeon, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel. The first GATS outcome (2009-10) said 34.6% adults were smokers but it fell to 28.6% in 2016-17. tnn
