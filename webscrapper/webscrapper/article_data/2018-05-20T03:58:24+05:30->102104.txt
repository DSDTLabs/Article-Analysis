MUMBAI: The police foiled a robbery bid at a   station in Malad and stumbled upon a gang that has cases registered against it at 11 police stations in  . Interrogations revealed that the men had also faked a collision with an autorickshaw in Malad and stole the passenger's bag containing Rs 15 lakh in the commotion. The stolen cash has been recovered. 

 
 On April 13, the Kurar police received information that a robbery had been planned at a CNG station on   in Malad East. A trap was laid and around 3.10am, three men were caught with a countrymade revolver, a sword, two choppers, chilly powder, a nylon rope, a motorcycle without a numberplate and an Ertiga with a Gujarat registration number. Those arrested were Pratik Panvekar (20), Vikas Ghumane (24), and Vishal Tanwani (25). Four of their aides managed to flee. 
 
 The police said that the gang has committed a few offences in Thane and Navi Mumbai too. "The accused were also involved in stealing a bag belonging to a businessman," said DCP Vinaykumar Rathod. 
 
 On April 6, when Devendra Jalan, a businessman from Malad's  , was travelling in an auto from Malad station to Goregaon around 5.25pm, a motorcycle brushed his vehicle on the service road of Western Express Highway near a   office. The motorcyclist got off and started arguing with the auto driver. While Jalan was distracted by the altercation, the motorcyclist's aide made off with his bag containing Rs 15 lakh cash. Jalan later registered a complaint with the Kurar police but the case remained unsolved until the arrest of this gang last month. 
 
 The police suspect the gang may have kept a watch on Jalan and struck knowing that he was carrying a lot of cash. "They would usually target people close to a bank, shop or a busy market place," said senior inspector Uday Rajeshirke, Kurar police.
