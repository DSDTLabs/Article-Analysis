 “I have received a communication on the committee approved by the chancellor. The senate had said the chancellor should appoint on his own an independent committee, with the option of adding and deleting any person from it. The chancellor selected one of the names sent by the senate to head the committee and his office has asked me to communicate to the members, and I have done so,” said PU registrar Col G S Chadha (retd). The case dates back to April 15, 2015 when a faculty member had levelled allegations of sexual harassment against the VC, whose term ends in July.
 
 Names of Arora, Sandhu on list
 
 On February 17, the senate decided to send the names of Jyoti Arora, additional chief secretary, Haryana, and Sandhu to the chancellor. The MHRD had directed PU to recommend names for the committee, which would then be approved by the chancellor. Earlier, the syndicate had recommended the name of former Haryana chief secretary Meenakshi Anand Chaudhary, who had refused to chair the committee since she was not currently employed anywhere, which goes against the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,  ) Act.
