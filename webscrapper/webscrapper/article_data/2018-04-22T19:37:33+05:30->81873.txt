 â€œSurface of the dam will serve as a screen measuring 400 foot wide and 500 foot high, on which we could run laser shows depicting the history of KSEB. Three hundred metres away from the screen, there will be seating for 600-700 people in an amphitheatre-style. There must be 20,000 sq ft of vacant space below these seats, which we are planning to convert into a shopping centre," said Jose. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Further, there is a two-acre space beyond the amphitheatre, where the KHTC is planning to build an aquarium. "Top of the aquarium will be constructed of toughened glass and people could walk on it, watching the fish," Jose said. The laser show and aquarium will consume 15 acres and the KHTC will provide parking space at another 10 acres.
 
 Currently, at the initial planning stage, the laser show project will need Rs 26 crore to complete. "We have invited a project consultant to prepare detailed project report," Jose said.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 KHTC is an initiative aimed at increasing the non-tariff revenue of KSEB using the resources and land lying unused with the organisation. Of the 58 dams in the state, the organisation has started tourism projects in 21 dams.
 
 Boating will be introduced at Banasura Sagar, Kundala, Anayirangal, Lower Meenmutty, Chengulam, Kakkayam and Ponmudi dams. "It will be done as joint venture with private investors," Jose said.
 
 In order to accommodate the expected flow of tourists to Munnar during Kurinji flowering season, which starts in August, the KHTC will provide space for 1,200 cars near Munnar Headworks.
