NEW DELHI: Students may get confused when they go for admissions at other colleges if they do not read the fine print in the   (JMC) prospectus. Unlike other institutions,   is giving students a benefit in the cutoff percentage if they take admission in the bachelor’s course of a subject they have studied in Class XII.

 In the  , weightages have been given to subjects studied by the aspirants in Class XII if they are applying to the same course in the college. This does not exist in other colleges. For instance, in history the college is giving a 2% weightage to those students who include the subject in their ‘Best of Four’ calculation.
 
 “We are following our own policy. I believe that as a minority institution we should be given the liberty to decide it,” said a college official.
 
 The official clarified that since St Stephen’s college has an additional criteria for interviews vis-à-vis other institutions, “we too have a system where we give benefit to students based on the subjects they have studied.”
 
  official, however, said that the general guidelines for admission are the same for every college. “Such liberty to give extra weightage to subjects shouldn’t be done by the colleges,” said Ashutosh Bharadwaj, OSD. Another university official said that only 1% rebate to girl students is allowed by DU and “JMC shouldn’t be violating the norms.”
 
 JMC officials said that students are happy with the weightage being given to the subjects. “It builds their confidence in studying a particular subject. Our policy is similar to the university deducting marks if a student includes a subject not in the ‘List A’ or ‘C1&2’ for arts and commerce in the Best of Four calculations,” said a JMC official.
