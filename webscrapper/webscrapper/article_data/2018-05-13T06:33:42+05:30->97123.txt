PUNE: A boy (15) was   on Friday night for raping a nine-year-old mentally challenged girl in a house at   around 10.30am.

 The girl and the boy resided in the same locality and knew each other. Their parents work as labourers at an under-construction site. 
 
 An officer of the Mundhwa police said, “The girl was playing with a puppy outside her house when the boy picked it up and walked away from the place. The girl started following the boy and pleaded to release the dog, but in vain. The boy lured the girl to a house promising to release the puppy. He raped her there and took to heels. The incident came to light after the terrified girl narrated the incident to her mother when she returned home.” 
 
 The girl’s mother registered a complaint against the minor under sections of the IPC and POCSO Act. “The boy was later detained and sent to a correction centre,” the officer added.
