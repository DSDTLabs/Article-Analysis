JAIPUR: Sleuths of the income tax department and the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) have not yet found the beneficiary of the Rs 4 crore seized from a private bus near Manoharpur on   highway on Thursday.

 Since the person, identified as Fazle Rauf, a   councillor from Bhilwara, is missing, officials said that nothing much can be said of the beneficiaries and where the money was actually supposed to be delivered.
 
 On Thursday, the ATS team had seized unaccounted cash worth Rs 4 crore from a   private bus near Manoharpur area on the outskirts of Jaipur and referred the matter to the I-T department.
 
 Preliminary investigation suggested that the money was being taken to Congress councillor Rauf and a businessman, identified as Deepak Samthani.
 
 “One of the detained persons had claimed that the money belonged to a Congress councillor Rauf in Bhilwara. In order to verify the claim, we need to find and question Rauf who has been missing since Thursday. As it’s a part of   racket, there is a possibility that the money was to be delivered somewhere else via Rauf,” said a senior I-T officer on condition of anonymity on Friday.
 
 Since Rauf has gone missing after the money was seized, ATS officials are also keeping a track of developments. “If it was just a simple hawala transaction, he (Rauf) need not have absconded as a person caught with unaccounted money is liable to pay 60% of the actual money seized and some penalty. His absence is creating some doubts,” said a senior ATS officer.
 
 Rauf’s alleged fleeing is also a hint that this may not be a regular hawala case.
 
 “Since, we have been working on the case for the past two months, we have got many evidences to explore various other possibilities,” said deputy inspector general (DIG) Vikas Kumar, ATS.
