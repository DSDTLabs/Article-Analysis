My life is full of incidents that include both accidents and cherishing moments. I lacked motivation and enthusiasm because I had been suffering from depression and periodic anxiety for the last 7 years. Thanks to my previous supervisor and colleagues who put me in this situation. Life was full of crest and trough until the day our   arrived. 

 I was delighted to have a baby and was hoping that the dark period will soon be over. But it didn't happen. I was too busy working in   to notice that a new life was flourishing in our home. I was missing the special moments with my baby. 
 
 One day, I got a call from my parents to visit home for Diwali and take some time off from office. I took a leave for two days to visit my hometown. After reaching Jaipur, we found that our baby was suffering from high fever (103
  F). He couldn't sleep properly and woke up in the middle of the night. He grabbed my hand firmly with his little fingers looking for solace (he was just 11 months at that time). Away from my routine life, I realised the importance of   in the true sense that night. I was amazed to see that he was trying to stand up and wanted to play, even though his body temperature was soaring.
 
 The moment enlightened me and I started noticing my baby. In fact, I have learned more things from him in next six months than anyone else in my life. Thanks to my  , every day is a learning experience for me.
