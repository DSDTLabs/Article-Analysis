Margao: Residents of Sao Jose de   on Tuesday prevented railway officials from demarcating land in the village for the South Western Railway’s (SWR) double-tracking project.

 Sources said when railway officials arrived at the Sao Jose de Areal railway station to carry out demarcation work, agitated locals confronted and obstructed them from doing the work. 
 
 The protesters said the village comprised predominantly tribal folk and that agriculture was its mainstay. “Hence, any move to destroy fields would also destroy our livelihood,” they said. Villagers said they also feared an influx of migrants if double-tracking was carried out.
