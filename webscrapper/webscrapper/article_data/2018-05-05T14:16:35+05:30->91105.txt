Panaji: As   Chodankar formally took over the helm of the state   unit on Friday, the Congress blew the poll bugle and urged all its workers to gear up for the 2019 Lok   elections. Exhorting them to look beyond the debacle surrounding the 2017 state assembly polls, party workers, including Chodankar, said the time had come to expose the   government’s misdeeds.

 “Goa needs to start working to ensure that in the 2019 elections, it is the Congress that forms the government at the Centre. Once that is done, the Congress will automatically form the government in Goa,” AICC secretary and Latur MLA Amit Deshmukh said while addressing a few hundred party supporters in the capital.
 
 The wake-up call for the state Congress was also issued by Goa desk in-charge, A Chella Kumar, who said that it was for each party worker to reach out to voters and “expose the BJP government”.
 
 Chodankar, a former NSUI leader, took over the reins of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) from former Rajya Sabha MP Shantaram Naik. 
 
 In his first address as state party president, Chodankar said politics had changed over the last 20 years and there was a need for today’s politicians to adapt. “The party cannot set the agenda and then forget the people’s voice. The people must set the agenda. Let’s put the focus on the people and not just on winning elections,” Chodankar said. He also ordered his party members not to use his photograph in any banners or in the party office. He also chided his well-wishers for garlanding him and said that henceforth, politicians should shun such practices.
 
 As part of the preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Chodankar plans to start a membership drive across the state. He urged party workers to reactivate block level committees in each constituency and to start a dialogue with voters.
