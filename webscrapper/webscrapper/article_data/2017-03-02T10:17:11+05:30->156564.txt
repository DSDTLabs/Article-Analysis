PANAJI: Continuing its efforts to recover dues from defaulters, the corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP) on Wednesday issued the final demand notice for recovery of Rs 42.34 lakh from the contractor for sopo (market tax). While CCP has issued the final demand notice to private contractor,   for dues pending since 2013-14, the corporation is also in the process of issuing a similar notice to   for sopo dues pending since 2014-15, said commissioner  .

 “We intended to file a legal suit for recovery, but on the advice of our lawyer, a final demand notice has been sent for now and then the recovery suit will follow,” Dessai said. According to CCP documents, Mayekar owes CCP dues amounting to Rs 5 lakh for sopo collected in 2013-14 and Rs 37.34 lakh for sopo collected in 2015-16.
 
 The sopo contract to collect market tax from vendors in the municipal market and other areas in CCP jurisdiction was allotted to Mayekar for Rs 62 lakh, but the contractor paid only Rs 35 lakh even as CCP delayed inking the contract for collection of sopo fees, CCP officials said. Further, no steps were initiated by CCP staff to recover the balance of Rs 27 lakh and on the contrary, Mayekar was given extension of three more months for collection of sopo without the pending dues being documented in CCP files.
 
 In July 2016, mayor   raised a ruckus during a council meeting, which then led to the suspension of the dealing hand Narayan Kavlekar for his role in the alleged financial irregularities.
 
 From 2011 to 2012, the civic body that administers the state capital collected around Rs 44 lakh through sopo, but the collections came down in 2012-2013 to Rs 27 lakh. In 2013-14, the collection rose again to over Rs 42 lakh, but once again fell in 2014-2015 to Rs 31 lakh, which further decreased in 2015-2016 to Rs 19 lakh.
 
 Some councillors had demanded an FIR against Kavlekar and outgoing chief minister   had promised to initiate a crime branch inquiry into the sopo scam.
