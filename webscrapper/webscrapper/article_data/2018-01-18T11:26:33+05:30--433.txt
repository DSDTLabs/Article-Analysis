PANAJI: The search for King   to lead the celebrations for   2018, which starts on February 10, has begun. The selection committee has invited entries from large-hearted, jolly, fun-loving Goans for King Momo.

 The four-day festival kicks off with a colourful street parade in   flagged off by King Momo. 
 
 An official said that this year the venue for the Carnival parade may be shifted to and held along the   road from the current route, which starts from the Divja circle. The issue of shifting the route was discussed at a meeting held last month, while some memebers are opposed to the new route. 
 
 A member of the committee said, it was decided to shift the venue and the authorities are likely to stick to their decision. “The new venue was suggested due to traffic congestion from the parade of floats along main streets. Traffic entering and exiting the city has to be diverted,” he said.
 
 Goa tourism development corporation (GTDC) along with civic bodies has been celebrating the festival in a grand way since the last few years. Goa also sees a sizeable number of domestic and foregin tourists during four days of the festival, which kicks off in Panaji and is also held in Margao, Vasco and Mapusa.
 
 King Momo takes centerstage during the Carnival celebrations as he throws open the parades across the state. Officials said that the last day of submission of entries for King Momo is January 25, and that the selection would be done on January 30. Entries have been invited from aspiring candidates with their full-size as well as a close-up photograph along with the name, address, contact details and a brief profile.
