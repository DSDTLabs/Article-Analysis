KOLKATA: IIT-JEE (Advanced) will move to a fully electronic platform this year, with all candidates having to type-in their answers on computers, much like it happens in the   (CAT) for IIMs. The exam is scheduled to be held on May 20. The candidates will have to compulsorily submit the papers on which they scribble their rough work. 

 Another big change concerns a common scenario, when two or more candidates have the same score. In that case, students with least negative marks (given for wrong answers) will automatically rank higher than others with the same score but with more wrong answers. If there is a tie, the marks in mathematics, and then physics, will be considered. The decision to switch over to a computer-based exam follows the observation that an overwhelming majority of students who clear the first round, IIT-JEE (Main), and appear for IIT-JEE (Advanced) are exposed to computers either at school or  . The shift to computers will also give candidates the option of seeing a question in either Hindi or English.
