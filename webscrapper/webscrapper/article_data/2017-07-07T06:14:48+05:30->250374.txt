LUCKNOW: The   claims it has been conducting   in as many as 16 wards of the city in four days, with an aim to kill larva and mosquito at source. When TOI conducted a reality check of the localities, a different picture came to the fore as residents pointed out the anomalies.

 Clogged drains and garbage dumped on roadside presented a sight of unsanitary conditions and a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Most of the residents had seen no cleaning or   activity in their areas, while wherever health department did conduct the drive, it was unsatisfactory and ineffective to bring down the rising number of   following the rains.
 
 Sector 17, Indiranagar resident P C Pant said, “I have not seen any fogging or other exercise to curb breeding of mosquitoes in our area in the last few years and I wonder where the government staff goes to conduct these drives.”
 
 In Vishal Khand of Gomtinagar, which health department claimed to have covered in its   spray exercise, resident Asadullah said, “My daughters are suffering from high grade fever and I am scared it is caused by mosquitoes.” The situation was no different in Vipul Khand of Gomtinagar either.
 
 When TOI visited the several lanes and localities comprising Nishatganj, there was resentment among residents. While the area was touched upon by health care workers for the anti-larval drive, resident complained it was only namesake.
 
 Nishatganj resident Anand said, “The treatment they did is just not effective and there has not been any fogging in the last many months.” Another resident Zaheer Khan of Balda road, shared the same concern, “The team did come to our area but the activity was limited to only a select few roadside drains and it seems the purpose of the drive was only to click photographs for the records.”
