PANAJI: Refuting claims that other parties are also in the fray to join the ‘mahayuti’ of the   (GSM),   and   (MGP),   MP from Maharashtra and senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, on Tuesday said there’s no such possibility either before or after the election. 

 “Apart from the MGP and GSM, I don’t think there is any other like-minded party in Goa. These three parties have come together because they share the same ideology,” Raut said, adding that there is no fixed formula for seat-sharing.
 
 With the declaration of Sanjay Naik’s candidature on Tuesday, Shiv Sena completed the announcement of contestants for seats allotted to it post-alliance. Sangam Bhosle was named its candidate for Tivim on Monday.
 
 The party is set to bring in its star leaders to kick off campaigning in the state. 
 
 “Aditya Thackeray (Yuva Sena head) will participate in a road show on January 29 and January 30. He will visit all the four constituencies the Sena is contesting.   (Shiv Sena leader) will hold a public meeting in Cuncolim and Saligao on January 31 and February 1 respectively,” Raut announced. When questioned about the absence of a candidate from the minority community, Raut said that would have been possible only if the party were to contest more seats.
