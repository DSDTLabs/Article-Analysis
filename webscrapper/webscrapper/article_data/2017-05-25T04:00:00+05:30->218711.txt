Ahmedabad: The Odisha government will hold the ‘Festival of Innovation’, inspired by the report of an Ahmedabad-based organization — Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies and Institutions (SRISTI) — on innovative practices observed during the 39th  , or journeys in search of knowledge.

 Anil Gupta, a retired IIM-A faculty member and the SRISTI president, on Wednesday told reporters that the Odisha government will hold the festival along the lines of the one being held at the Rashtrapati Bhawan annually. Gupta said that he and 50 volunteers had walked around 120km during the 39th Shodh Yatra that began from Barpali and ended in Nursinghnath in Bargarh district of Odisha, covering around 30 villages from May 11 to 18. The yatra unearthed traditional knowledge and grassroots innovations that have not only simplified lives of people but have also contributed to the conservation of biodiversity. A wide range of innovations were discovered. These included a fully automatic bed for disabled and ailing people which had an inbuilt basin; to practical techniques to teach mathematics with the help of models. “With this journey, we wish to create a bridge to the knowledge of the past 100 years and to pass it on to generations of the next 100 years,” Gupta said.
