NAGPUR: “It is mandatory to leave open space around every tree while paving way for footpaths,” said environment activist  , on Monday.

 Speaking at a discussion on ‘saving trees from concretization of city footpaths’ organized by Nagpur University Alumni Association at Alumni Association Hall, university library in Ramdaspeth, Soni said, “Most of the city trees are sealed with cement and construction rubble which has such a telling effect on the top soil that nutrients and water do not reach the roots. Concretization is causing havoc to the very existence and growth of this source and supporter of life.”
 
 He said that concretization has many detrimental effects on biodiversity. “It causes immense damage to the trees, soil, climate, living organisms and habitat of tree dwellers. Trees give us shade and clean air. They are home to various species of birds, reptiles and squirrels,” Soni said.
 
 Soni said that Nagpur was once a greener city with tall and healthy trees. “Many roads had beautiful canopy because trees had enough space to grow. But now, many fully grown trees in the city are dying,” he said.
 
 He said that Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti has filed a petition in the   (NGT) seeking de-cementing of all tree bases in Mumbai.   directed the   to remove concrete around tree trunks and bases and ensure that no construction or repair work is done in that space.
 
 NGT also directed   to conduct a survey of all tree roots which have penetrated roads and footpaths, and measure the depth of such roots underneath by a proper scientific method with the help of the horticulture department.
