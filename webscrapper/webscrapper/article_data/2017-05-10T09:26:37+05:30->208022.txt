MANDYA: Some youths exhumed a body and cremated it in   village of Maddurtauk on Monday night.

 According to villagers,   died on July 14, 2016 and had been buried. On Monday night, some youths exhumed the remains secretly and tried to cremate them. Half-burnt body parts were scattered near the open grave.
 
 Ramanna's family and other villagers were shell-shocked by the incident which they least expected in their village.
 
 “We don't know the exact reason for this. It's possible it was done to ensure good rainfall in the village. We're investigating this matter,“ a police officer said.
 
 There is a blind belief in   district that sometimes a particular village doesn't get rainfall if the body of a cursed man (as perceived by the villagers) is buried, not cremated. Villagers would decide to exhume the body and cremate it.
 
 Some residents of Malagaranahalli village claimed the decision to exhume the body and cremate it was taken by the elders in the hope it would bring copious rain to Malagaranahalli village. Ramanna's family members, however, opposed this move. Irregardless, some youths went ahead with this bizarre ritual.
 
 According to sources, a fight broke out between the groups and a person was injured in the melee. Police have been deployed in the village, where tension prevails, to thwart any untoward incident.
