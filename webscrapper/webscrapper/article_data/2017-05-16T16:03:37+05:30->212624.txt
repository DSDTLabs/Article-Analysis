Former One Direction star   said his partner   Cheryl picked 'Bear' as the name for their new born baby boy. The 23-year-old singer says his partner prefers original and unusual names and that he wanted to go by her decision.

  
  
 "I'm into more traditional names, the Mrs ... She's more into more unique, original names that people will remember. It was her choice. I wasn't going to fight her about it, she's the one who's done all the work, isn't she?" Payne said. 
 
 The singer is on cloud nine since the birth of his little one and wants to spend more and more time with him. "We're always Facetiming and the other day he smiled at me for the first time, it was so special. I just want to spend every moment with him but she (Cheryl) is so great, she does everything on her own. She's been amazing," he said.
