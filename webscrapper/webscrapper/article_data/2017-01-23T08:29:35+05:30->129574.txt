KORAPUT: Thirty-three-year-old   remembers discussions on weddings and a lot of laughter in the S8 bogie of the   in which he was travelling on Saturday.

 All of the gaiety would soon be replaced by   and his three friends who had boarded the train in Rayagada for Bhubaneswar at around 10.30 pm.
 
 "Having switched off my phone at 11.10 pm, I was trying to sleep. In a few seconds, I heard a loud sound as the train shook violently. It seemed like bombs were exploding," said Chiranjeevi. "Our bogie had tilted to the right and passengers were falling upon one another. My right thigh was hit and severely paining. My friends and I managed to come out from the bogie and heard screams all around. There were bodies strewn all over and I was trembling with fear," he said.
 
 With his friends, Chiranjeevi managed to help as many as 30 people come out of the bogie until rescue teams from Rayagada reached the spot. "Three of our co-passengers were crushed to death," said Chiranjeevi, who was discharged from the   after preliminary treatment on Sunday evening.
