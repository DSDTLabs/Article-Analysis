NEW DELHI: Three flats on the fourth floor of a government housing   in   were burgled on   afternoon as the occupants were out on vacation. The theft was discovered by neighbours who had found the door locks broken. 

 Nishant Mehra, secretary of the RWA for Type III flats of   Secretariat Residential Complex in Sector II said flat numbers 401, 402 and 403 were burgled. Two executive officers and an assistant security officer of the Lok Sabha live in these flats. 
 
 “The thieves used crowbars to break open the locks and fled with valuables. They must been there for nearly an hour,” said Mehra.
 
 These flats had been inaugurated by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan in 2015. “There are 184 flats and all the residents are in shock after this,” Mehra said.
 
 Police suspect it to be an insider job. Some domestic helps and security guards are being questioned if they saw any strangers enter or leave.
 
 Mehra said the complex has no   cameras and the RWA has been pressing the authorities to install some. There is a security guard near the entrance of the complex, but he too is placed at the gate and it is unlikely that if anyone enters the complex from other sides, he would be aware of it.
 
 The RWA members claim that several letters have been written to the area representatives as well to install CCTV cameras but nothing positive has come out of that exercise.
