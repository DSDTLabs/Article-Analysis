BHUBANESWAR: The director-general of police (DGP), R P Sharma, on Monday asked the   to monitor the investigations into last week's twin   districts. Police are yet to make any headway in either case. 

 On Friday, armed miscreants looted Rs 23 lakh in cash and jewellery worth over Rs 40 lakh from a nationalized bank in Angul. On the same day, another gang looted a bank in Nayagarh district and fled with Rs 80,000 in cash.
 
 "I have asked the additional director-general of the Crime Branch, Santosh Upadhyay, to visit Angul first as more money was looted there. He will monitor the   and guide the local police," Sharma told TOI. 
 
 He has also asked the Crime Branch to issue an advisory to all the SPs on ways of probing such cases. 
 
 "The Crime Branch will issue an advisory to banks on the steps they can take to enhance security. The Crime Branch has been asked to hold a meeting with senior functionaries of banks to discuss safety measures," Sharma said.
 
 Sources said the Crime Branch had asked Angul and Nayagarh police to keep a watch on local criminals. Besides, it has asked police in other districts to get details of people who have been arrested earlier in connection with   cases. 
 
 "We will also examine if anyone arrested for bank robbery recently got bail," a Crime Branch officer said.
