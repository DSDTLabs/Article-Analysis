Coimbatore: Following the death of two elderly women allegedly due to food poisoning after they consumed prasadam from a temple, the Mettupalayam Government Hospital witnessed an increase in admission of patients,  

 The number of devotees admitted was around 37 and it increased to 53 at one time. But, three of them were discharged later. The hospital administration said their condition was stable.
 
 “Since some of the in-patients were dehydrated. They were given the appropriate treatment. Moreover, the hospital administration stopped their relatives from providing outside food so as not to aggravate their condition,” chief medical officer of Mettupalayam GH S Seralathan said.
 
 “People need not to panic. All of them are stable. The hospital has enough medicines to treat them all. Medical teams from Annur and Periyanaickenpalayam primary health centres have been roped in,” he said.
 
 S Savithri, 60 and G Loganayagi, 68, both from Nadar Colony near Mahadevapuram, had allegedly consumed prasadam from a temple and were declared brought dead to the GH.
 
 Mettupalayam police registered cases under Section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death). “The preliminary investigations found that Savithri could have consumed prasadam while chances for the same could be less in case of Loganayagi. The postmortem processes have been done, viscera samples were sent for chemical analysis,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Food safety and drug administration officials have collected samples of the ghee, which was used for making the prasadam from a shop where it was purchased along with aval (flattened rice), pori (puffed rice) and sugar. 
 
 The samples were sent for lab test. A team of revenue authorities and a team led by epidemiologist are conducting a study on the issue.
