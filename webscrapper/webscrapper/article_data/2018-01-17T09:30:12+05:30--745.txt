LUCKNOW: The decision on increasing the   run by   will be taken soon.

  will conduct elections for appointment of executive committee members on January 19. The committee’s formation is integral to lay down the budget for the next year and take a call on various important decisions. One of these is the proposal to increase the rent of   or community centres.
 
 According to the proposal, rent of Kalyan Mandaps will go up by 100% and in some cases, even by four times.
 
 The move was enforced in September 2017 for a few days but was soon withdrawn owing to stiff opposition from various resident welfare societies.
 
 Community halls of Mansarovar Yojna and that of Mankameshwar ward in Daliganj had seen a jump of four times.
 
 LMC owns about 10 Kalyan Mandaps in the city. Their rent is lesser than other private community halls.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   said, “Even after adopting the raise, the rent of our Kalyan Mandaps will be lesser than the market rate of private halls. The rates were last increased five years ago. It is now difficult to maintain them with such less revenue.”
 
 LMC claims that incorporation of GST has forced it to adopt such an increase in rents. The proposal will be presented to the new committee after January 19 for approval. Once approved, it will be sent to the full house for final nod for implementation from the next financial year.
