Panaji: High court of Bombay at Goa has admitted a public interest litigation (PIL), challenging constitutional validity of the law empowering directorates of panchayats and municipal administration to carry out delimitation and reservation of wards.

 The division bench held that the petition calls for proper examination of constitutional provisions and state laws as to who should carry out the process, and fixed it after vacation for final hearing.
 
 Mango Foundation, an NGO, had prayed that the court strike down Section 7 of Goa Panchayat Act and Section 10 of Goa Municipalities Act as being unconstitutional.
 
 The petitioner had alleged that the process, being carried out by both departments, is not free and fair, as both are under control of the government.
 
 The state election commission (SEC) had been empowered to carry out the process to ensure justice to all. The petitioner had prayed that an order be issued restraining both departments from delimitating and reserving wards in future and that SEC be entrusted the task.
 
 While arguing the matter on the petitioner's behalf, advocate Wilbur Menezes contended that there are numerous complexities and misgivings that need to be clarified, and reaffirmed his stand that it is only the state election commission who can delimit and reserve wards as per the constitution. tnn
