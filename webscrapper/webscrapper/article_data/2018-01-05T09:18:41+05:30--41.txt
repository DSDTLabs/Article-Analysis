CUDDALORE: Initial inquiries into the murder of a six-month pregnant woman, her daughter and son, by her husband in   revealed that the man was under the influence of alcohol when he committed the crime. 

 The man identified as S  , 35, slit the throats of his pregnant wife A Kumari, daughter A Abitha, 6, and son A Abhishek, 4, using a knife and later committed suicide at his house near Kullanchavadi in the district. Police said Aadhimoolam, a pushcart ice cream vendor, used to work as a coolie in   during the off-season. He reached his native village, Puliyur, three months ago to attend his mother's funeral. A habitual drinker, he suspected his wife of infidelity. He went into depression after his mother's death and often quarrelled with his wife over petty issues. After one such fight, Kumari left home with the two children and started living with her mother S  . However, the couple reconciled their differences after their relatives intervened.
 
 The couple, who were expecting their third baby, started quarrelling again after the man refused to go to work. Kanagavalli was supporting the family financially. On Wednesday, Kanagavalli dropped off her granddaughter at school and left home. When she came back, she found the house locked from inside. She peeped through the window only to find her son-in-law hanging from the ceiling of the room. She broke open the door with the help of neighbours, only to find her daughter and grandchildren lying dead in a pool of blood. Kullanchavadi police have registered a case.
