 Railways, Delhi Development Authority and three municipal bodies, who own land along these rail lines, have agreed to issue no objection certificate for construction of toilets, a ministry source said. The issue has been pending for long. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by housing and urban affairs secretary Durga Shanker Mishra. This was the third such meeting on the issue. Sources said the secretary had taken up the issue with railways minister and railway officials.
 
 “Railways had concern that construction of toilets would impact their operations. But they also appreciated that there was a need to build toilets since people defecating in the open along railway track send a bad impression about the country. Tourists go back with a bad experience,” said a source. M Venkaiah Naidu, the former minister, had talked about it in the earlier meetings to find a solution to this menace. 
 
 There are 26 slum colonies on lands belonging to railways, DDA, MCDs and Uttar Pradesh government. In the first meeting it was decided that railways, DUSIB and MCDs will conduct joint inspection of all the 26 slum colonies to explore the feasibility of building toilets without impacting railway operations.
 
 “Inspection report was discussed on Wednesday. DUSIB informed that in respect of five colonies, availability of toilets will be augmented at the existing locations and in respect of four colonies with dense jhuggis in Jhakira-Charamandi area, mobile toilet vehicles will be deployed to begin with,” a ministry spokesperson said. DUSIB has told ministry that toilets would be built in these colonies by this October.
