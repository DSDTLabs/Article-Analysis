BARASAT: A 19-year-old   riding a moped without helmet was killed after being hit by a   on   at Bagda in   on Tuesday morning. 

 Local residents put up a roadblock on Duttaphulia Road for over two hours following the accident. A mob initially didn't allow police to take away the victim's body for post-mortem. Later, a large contingent of police including RAF and combat force led by the senior district police officers rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control.
 
 Police said the accident took place around 10.30am when Priyanka Das, a BA second year geography honours student of Nadia's Bagula college and a resident of Bagda's Cossipore was on her way back home on a two-wheeler after attending a private coaching class.
 
 Witnesses said a speeding bus on route 92/A (Bongaon-Duttaphulia) hit the moped from behind and fled the spot. "The bus was at a breakneck speed and as the moped came in front of the bus, the driver couldn't control and rammed into her. The girl was thrown off and landed nearly 12ft-15ft away," a local trader said. She was taken to the Bagdah State General hospital where she was declared brought dead.
