BHOPAL: Passengers at the railway station here would   be spoilt for choice as far as quality food is concerned. After sanitary vending machine and on-station medical support, all six platforms of the station are set to have modular food stalls in the next six months. As per senior divisional commercial manager (DCM) Vinod Tamori, soon tenders would be invited for the same.

 “Every platform should have 12 food stalls as per the new plan, apart from existing stalls, we will fulfil the deficiency,” said Tamori. “As of now, there are no food stalls installed on platform six, but within next six months, we will be able to serve passengers with good quality food products there too,” added Tamori.
 
 At present, there are 32 stalls including that of food, books and dairy items functioning on five platforms, according to officials.
 
 “These stalls will be different from traditional ones functioning at present. A similar facility can be seen at Habibganj platform 1, which is still under construction,” said Tamori.
 
 Tamori added, “The new food stalls will be modular and will be divided into groups, including those selling packed products, semi-cooked items and those who cook on order.”
 
 DRM Shobhan Chaudhary said, “As per new catering policy, we have to increase the number of food stalls on platforms.” As per officials, the catering services will be transferred to   through mobile catering units, base kitchens, cell kitchens, refreshment rooms at A1 and A categories of stations, under the new catering policy.
 
 The old and existing catering stalls will be replaced gradually with compact modular stalls of superior quality material. An official added, “The menu and tariff of catering units, other than Food plazas, will be fixed by IRCTC in consultation with the  .”
