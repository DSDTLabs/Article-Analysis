CHANDIGARH: Union food processing industry minister   on Saturday urged CM   to restart the Bathinda  , saying a state asset which was capable of being run till 2029, after Rs 715 crore renovation, should not be allowed to waste away.

 The SAD leader said it was shocking that a plant, for which the erstwhile SAD-BJP government in the state had secured Rs 715 crore for renovation from the Centre, was being closed down arbitrarily. “In the light of facts it seems this has been done only to sell away its assets, including 2,000 acres of prime land, for commercial gain by vested interests,” she added.
 
 The   MP said state finance minister   had held a gate meeting at the plant in the run-up to the last elections and promised workers that it would be run on full load. “Now the same individual has made out a case for closing the thermal plant by mouthing lies that power was being produced at Rs 11.5 per unit and that the government was incurring a monthly expenditure of Rs 1,300 crore to run the plant. This is nothing but a conspiracy to disband a state asset for ulterior motives,” she added.
 
 She claimed that the   (CEA) guidelines were being wrongly quoted to make out a case for closing the plant as guidelines spoke about retiring non-reheat units of 100 megawatt or less while the Bathinda plant had units of 110/120 MW with reheat cycle.
