AMBALA: Former   (CPS) Ram Kishan Gujjar of the Congress, who was convicted in a case of   of a journalist, was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by an Ambala court on Thursday. 

 The court of additional sessions judge Sanjeev Arya also directed Gujjar and two other convicts in the case to pay Rs 5 lakh each to the victim's family.
 
 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 each on the convicts. Besides Gujjar, Micky Lala and Ajit Aggarwal, both residents of Naraingarh town of Ambala district, were convicted.
 
 Victim Pankaj Khanna, a journalist of Naraingarh, had ended his life on June 10, 2009 and accused the three of forcing him to take the extreme step in his suicide note. 
 
 Pankaj had stated in the note that Gujjar had a grudge against him as his family had parted ways with the Congress ending an old association.
 
 "After some time, my maternal uncle joined   and other family members supported his decision. This did not go do down well with Gujjar. The   harassed me several times in various ways. His accomplices had beaten me mercilessly," he stated in the suicide note.
 
 Police had lodged an FIR against Gujjar and his two aides on a complaint by Pankaj's father Yashpal Khanna and then given clean chit to Gujjar after investigation. Pankaj's family had moved the court of the additional sessions judge saying that Gujjar could not be given a clean chit as his name was in the suicide note. 
 
 The court had upheld the contention and issued summons to Gujjar. The ex-MLA had then moved the Punjab and Haryana high court but his appeal was dismissed.
