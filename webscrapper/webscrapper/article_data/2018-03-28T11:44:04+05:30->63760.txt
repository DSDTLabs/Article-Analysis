HYDERABAD:   (ORR) has lost its ‘outer’ status within a decade of being thrown open for commuters, with the urban sprawl in Hyderabad now crossing the 158-km arterial road. It was supposed to be the outermost road network for intercity and national traffic for at least the next 10 years.

 The immediate fallout of the urban sprawl extending beyond the ORR, is a loss in the waterspread area of Hyderabad by a huge 500% in 13 years since work on the ORR began in 2005. Then, Hyderabad had a water spread of 12,537 hectares. Today, 13 years later, the area under water bodies has come down to 2,283 hectares.
 
 An international study stated that the urban sprawl has even resulted in a change in the water quality used for irrigation in peripheral areas of Hyderabad. With the area under water bodies falling, farmers are forced to draw water from polluted sources. This, in turn, has affected the quality of fruits and vegetables grown on city outskirts.
