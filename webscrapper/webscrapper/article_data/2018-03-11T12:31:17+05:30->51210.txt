Love is about playing hide-and-seek and marriage is about telling the world.   and  , the newly-weds, who have now moved in together to begin a new chapter in their lives, followed it all through their courtship. The couple, who reached the breaking point at one time in their lives, admitted that their much-publicised ‘parting ways’ was fabricated. After all, living in the public eye is bound to get to you after a point. It was all the more difficult for Raj, whose love life is speculated about like the stock market. When things came to a head, both decided to keep the relationship low key. This is what the couple had to tell a friend who dropped in at their plush apartment a day after the wedding. In fact, Subhashree’s makeup person was not even aware that it was her wedding for which he was getting the actress ready. Raj too continued with his meeting for Kathmundu 2 till 3.30 pm, in case anyone checked on him. Though the social wedding is likely to take place on May 11, the duo said they will plan it meticulously and host five parties for friends who stood by them. A day after the registry marriage, Raj drove his wife home from a music awards, where she had a performance, blew kisses at her from the front row and was happy that he could now spend time in her makeup van without a care in the world.   too stood up through the sunroof of Raj’s car to see the Kolkata nightlife in a new light. The actress, who has played the bride a couple of times — her wedding pics from Kaushik Ganguly’s unreleased   went viral — wants to look her best this time around. She is sold on a red Benarasi, and the man in her life couldn’t have been happier.
