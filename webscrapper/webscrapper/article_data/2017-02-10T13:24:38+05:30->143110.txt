NEW DELHI: At a time when leaders of all the major politial parties are burning the midnight oil preparing for  , there's one Prime Minister   fan in Lucknow that deserves a mention.

 A sweet shop in Lucknow has added some sweetness to the high-octane Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaign from the state assembly polls. The sweet maker has come up with special 'Modi' and 'Lotus' jalebis to extend his support and to temp voters to elect saffron party in the upcoming elections.
 
  
  This is not the first time fans have done something unusual for PM Modi.
 
  
  
  Last year, in Gujarat's Navsari district, people tried to make a record out of lighting 989 lamps simultaneously on the eve of Modi's birthday. The event made into the Guinness World Records. And world famous sand artist Sudarshan Pattnaik too made a sand sculpture highlighting PM's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
