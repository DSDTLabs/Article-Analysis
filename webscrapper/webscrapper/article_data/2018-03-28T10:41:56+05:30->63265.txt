NAGPUR: ‘Stree Sukta: Ek Natyavishkar’, a dramatic experiment in which issues women have to face in daily life as a commoner, and when they assume the seat of power, gave an insight into their problems since ages and made the spectators introspect, on Monday.

 The show was organized jointly by Vidarbha Gaurav Pratishthan and Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan at Scientific Society Hall. The play was staged as a celebration of World Theatre Day and the recently held International Women's Day.
 
 The play started with Amba, a central character in Mahabharat, speaking with the audience about the misfortunes of her life and holds Kuru prince Bhishma responsible for it. 
 
 Uniquely, the performance was divided into five parts in which women of different eras conveyed to Amba the atrocities they were subjected to.
 
 Women’s issue was the highlight of a scene from popular Marathi play ‘Wada Chirebandi’, written by Mahesh Elkunchwar. Prabha, a character in the play, was seen sulking as she was not allowed to take education as was the practice not long back in the country. She remains unmarried as she was unable to find an educated man.
 
 Some acts from plays ‘Shantata! Court Chalu Ahe’ and ‘Gharabaher’, written by   and   respectively, caught the attention. While the former depicted a scenario in which how women are judged in the society, the latter focused on the way the politics takes shape when a woman comes to power.
 
 Scenes from  's ‘Ekch Pyala’, based on alcoholism, and VV Shirwadkar’s ‘Chandra Jithe Ugwat Nahi’ threw light on prostitution.
 
 The dramatic compilation ended with Amba’s rebirth as Shikhandi who was used by Arjuna as a shield to kill Bhishma. 
 
 The play was conceptualized by Rekha Dandige-Ghiya. Datta Meghe, president of VGP, was the chief guest.
