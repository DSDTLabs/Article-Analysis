Navi Mumbai: The civic health department, along with the environment team, has started door-to-door inspection of the companies and their disposal system. The administration’s move is to check the residents’ regular claims that   factories are polluting the storm water  . The administration has already served notices to 83 units in September 2016, instructing them to comply with the norms.

 “Out of the 83 units served notices, 42 companies claimed that they are not releasing any   into the common drain,” said senior official from health department.
 
 While 30 companies have been inspected and samples from 14 were collected, said an official. To ensure veracity of the findings, samples are being tested in an MPCB-authorized laboratory. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
