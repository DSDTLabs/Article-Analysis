CHENNAI: The   has given four weeks to National Highways Authority of India ( ) to provide   and separate booths at toll gates so that their response time in case of   is as short as possible.

 When a   filed by a Congress advocate, A P Suryaprakasam, came up for hearing before a vacation bench on Wednesday, the bench comprising Justice R Mahadevan and Justice M Govindaraj said: “This court is of the opinion that the relief claimed in the writ petition is reasonable and, therefore, NHAI and the Union ministry of surface transport are directed to consider the representation dated June 1, 2016 and April 20, 2017, positively and take further action within four weeks.”
 
 In his petition, Suryaprakasam said during long road drives in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, he had noticed that there were no dedicated and separate toll gates for ambulances and other public utility services. He said the net result was that by the time the vehicles reached the accident spot it would be too late for accident victims.
 
 National highways in these two states have a high incidence of accidents due to reasons such as bad driving behaviour of drivers and influence of alcohol. Suryaprakasam said it was very essential to provide quick and immediate medical treatment within the golden hour to accident victims. Delay of every minute in providing medical aid to accident victims will cost their life, he said, adding that dedicated lanes and separate entry booths ambulances, fire service and other government vehicles at toll gates and booths in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry alone would prevent such delays, he said.
