Vadodara: Five people were injured in a blast in the basement of a jewellery shop at Ghadiyali Pol in old city on Sunday afternoon. Vadodara fire department officials said Alankar jewellers used to melt gold and make ornaments using gas cylinder in the basement of the shop. As the basement did not have ventilation, the leaked gas from a cylinder got accumulated in the small room beneath the shop. There was fire when the gas came in contact with some source of ignition, fire officials said. “The impact of the flash fire was such that the glass door of the shop broke and the ceiling came down. Nobody was injured in the fire. Those injured were because the ceiling came down on them,” said I I Sheikh, fire officer, Dandiya Bazaar fire station. As the firemen reached the spot, they brought out the gas cylinder from the basement and diluted the gas. Sheikh said had the cylinder blasted, the entire building would have collapsed since it is an old structure. The injured persons were taken to SSG Hospital.  Police helped in the shifting of the jewelleries from the shop to a safer location.
