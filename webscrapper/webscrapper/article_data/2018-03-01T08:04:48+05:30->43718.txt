LUCKNOW: In the absence of any rulebook on where to burn Holika, Lucknow is witnessing more bonfires this year than the number of   spots approved by the district administration. In many places, firewood has been dumped amid congested lanes which are already narrow for traffic while in other places, Holika is kept in close proximity to electric poles, raising concern for safety.

 
 The district administration gives permission to only 2,880 sites for Holika every year. This is a traditional list passed on every year without cross-checking sites about the physical conditions being the same. No one checks if the crossing has become narrower due to encroachment or some electrical cable has come up or if a new inhabitation has emerged.
 
 
 
 
 ADM west   said, “Holika is a religious matter and there is no rule for celebration of a festival. To check if a new Holika is being brunt without our approval, we ask the local   to do a reality check of their area every day.”
 
 
 All police outposts get a list of approved Holika sites in their jurisdiction every year but many manage to dump firewood in their localities without coming into the notice of police.
