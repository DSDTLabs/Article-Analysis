Panaji: Tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar on Monday said chief minister Manohar Parrikar and transport minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar “would find a solution to the problem”, even as tourist taxi operators remained firm abou keeping vehicles off the road on January 19. “We will ensure that tourists do not face any inconvenience. We will arrange vehicles to pick up and drop them to and from the airport and railway stations,” said Azgaonkar. He said this kind of a move would further “hurt the image of tourist taxi operators.” One of the chief reasons for the taxi strike call is to oppose the government’s decision to implement speed governors for commercial vehicles. Tourist taxi associations are also protesting the alleged harassment by officials of the transport department. Vinayak Nanoskar, general secretary, North Goa Tourist Taxi Association, said they are in no mood to hold discussions with the government at this stage and will go ahead with their decision to highlight the issues. Transport director Nikhil Desai said, “The operators have not approached me with any grievances. They must bring to my attention what harassment they are allegedly face at the hands of the RTO. If they are talking about speed governors, then it is a Supreme Court directive. Therefore, if the RTO mandates that the operators install the same, they cannot call this harassment.” Asked if taxi associations were willing to discuss their issues if a meeting was called, Nanoskar said past experience showed nothing came out of such discussions. “By keeping our vehicles off the road, we’ll able to show how we are affected,” he said. Nanoskar said while the department has been boasting about its various services that can now be availed online, a simple procedure like renewal of permit still takes two or three months. “If vehicle is caught without a permit, the operator is fined Rs 2,500. Why should we pay penalty when the fault is that of the transport department,” he said.
