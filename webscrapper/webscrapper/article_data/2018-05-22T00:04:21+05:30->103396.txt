Pune: The bag snatcher duo are on the prowl in different parts of the city despite police claiming that they had intensified patrolling in the morning. 

 In the sixth robbery that happened early in the morning this month, the purse of a woman (26) was snatched by a duo riding a motorcycle. 
 
 The incident happened on Sunday around 5am at Nal Stop Chowk on Karve Road. The purse contained gold ornaments and cash worth Rs25,000.
 
 The woman, a resident of Shivajinagar, went to attend a dance programme on Saturday night. 
 
 She had parked her scooter along the Paud Road and gone to the venue in a car,” said S G Chavan, the assistant inspector of the Alankar police.
 
 She picked up the scooter from Paud Road the next morning, and kept her purse, containing Rs4,500, gold ornaments, debit card, Aadhar card, PAN card and other important documents on the foot rest between the handle and driver’s seat.
 
 When she reached the Nal Stop Chowk, two men, following her on a motorcycle, snatched her purse and fled. “The duo then took U-turn at the chowk and went towards Kothrud at a high speed,” Chavan said.
 
 Due to the speed, the woman could not notice the registration number of the motorcycle. “The CCTV footage, too, was not clear. We are working on some leads to identify the culprits,” Chavan added.
 
 In a similar incident on Saturday, two men on a motorcycle snatched a bag containing Rs3,100 from a 72-year-old man near the Swargate bus stand around 5.15am. The victim was travelling in an autorickshaw. City police and the crime branch have launched a search to nab the duo.
