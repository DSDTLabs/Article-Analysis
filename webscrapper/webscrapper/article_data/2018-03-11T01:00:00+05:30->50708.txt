Now, with Raina back in Team India as well, it looks like the player has a promising time awaiting him year.

 I started working with my foundation a year ago. And it focuses on women and child development. I also got in touch with this radio brand when we took up an initiative for an orphanage in Delhi and we did some fund-raising for abandoned children.

So, it’s a very happy and emotional time for us.

Because she knows there’s someone with whom she can play and be naughty with (laughs). Once she went to the team’s dressing room at the stadium and he was very proud of that.
