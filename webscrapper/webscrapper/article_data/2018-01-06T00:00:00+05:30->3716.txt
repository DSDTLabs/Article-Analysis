For journalism graduate  , the opportunity to become an   came by chance. “I never dreamt of becoming an anchor. I got the offer after I completed my course. But I must say that I am enjoying every bit of it,” says Swathishta, who is presently hosting the show, Compass Countdown on Puthuyugam. “I am generally someone who loves to talk. So, anchoring came naturally to me. And hosting a show only makes you widen your knowledge about several topics,” she says. 

 Talking about the show, Swathishta says, “The show has five segments — cinema updates, celebrity tweets and gossip, viral videos on social media, news on science and technology and a section on sports. Every day, we come up with the most interesting news to give our viewers.” This 30-minute show is telecast every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
 
 Though Swathishta enjoys anchoring, she says she’s looking forward to her film career. “I got a lot of film opportunities after I became an anchor. I am waiting for my films to release and see how my career as an actor shapes up,” she signs off.
