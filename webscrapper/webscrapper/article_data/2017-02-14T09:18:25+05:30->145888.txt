BENGALURU: While debating the proposed reintroduction of the amendment to   Authorities Act, which plans to shrink open spaces and parks by 10%, legislators spent more time debating the less important point -the clause limiting the number of MLAs and MLCs on urban development authority boards to one each per year.

 Such was the opposition to limiting the number of MLAs and MLCs that law minister   was forced to recant on his decision to get the amendment bill passed. The bill was rejected before by Governor Vajubhai R Vala, who cited concerns about environmental hazards. “Let the bill remain pending, I will take the suggestions of the members, reconsider the bill and then come back to the assembly ,“ Jayachandra said.
 
 Members expressed concern about the curtailing of their powers. As per the bill, “not more than one member of the assembly representing part or whole of the local planning area and one member of the Karnataka legislative council registered as voter in the local planning area can be nominated by the government.“
 
 Opposition leader Jagadish Shettar (BJP) said the government was curbing the powers of legislators and trying to involve only ruling party MLAs in the decision-making process in urban bodies.“The government must remember that power is not permanent,“ Shettar said.
 
 Even Congress MLA from   said the government move to limit the number of MLAs in each urban development authority (UDA) was detrimental to the city's development.Legislators Sa Ra Mahesh and G T   said the gover nment was increasing the number of babus on these boards, but did not have confidence in elected legislators.
 
 While this debate raged, the more pertinent issue of the bill -shrinking of green space in urban areas -received less attention. Jayachandra said the government's decision to reduce open spaces and parks in layouts was mandated due to competition with the private layouts.“The reason for the amendments is to ensure that UDA layouts are more competitive in nature,“ said Jayachandra.
