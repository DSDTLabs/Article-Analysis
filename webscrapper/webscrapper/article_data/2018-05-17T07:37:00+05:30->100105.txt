Chandigarh: Punjab government on Wednesday decided to set up two committees for streamlining the system of providing security and security vehicles to officials and private individuals and sort out discrepancies in reallocation of villages under various police stations. Both committees would be headed additional chief secretary (home) N S Kalsi.

 The decision came from chief minister Amarinder Singh after taking cognizance of media reports highlighting that no rules and policies were being followed in granting security and related vehicles to officials and non-officials. An official spokesperson said to check avoidable expenditure and maintain desirable security standards it had been decided to set up a committee headed by ACS (home) with DGP (intelligence) and ADGP (security) as its members. The committee would lay down norms for provision of security and security vehicles to various officials and non-officials in Punjab.
 
 The other committee, to look at discrepancies in reallocation of villages under various police stations, will have DGP (provisioning) V K Bhawra and IGP (headquarters) Jatinder Singh Aulakh as its members. The committee has been asked to submit its report within a month. The decision to set this committee was taken in view of various representations received from villagers, who said their villages had been attached to certain police stations though they were located close to some other. The villagers had complained that they were facing extreme inconvenience due to this.
