Ludhiana: The SAD expelled a party leader at the 11th hour of filing nomination papers, but could not stop him from contesting on its party symbol, the weighing scale. The expelled leader, Harpreet Singh Bedi, who is contesting as an independent candidate from Ward 72, has been allotted the symbol due to “techinicalities”, according to election officials. 

 The district electoral officer, deputy commissioner Pardeep Aggarwal, said they could not provide another symbol to Bedi as the nomination process was time bound and the SAD informed them too late about the expulsion. “SAD sent us a letter to inform us about the cancellation of his membership on email. However, in this case, we require the application to be a hard copy, along with certain other documents,” Aggarwal said.
 
 Bedi is the husband of former councillor Veeran Bedi. A source in the SAD said Bedi had been removed from the party because of continuous indiscipline. “One of the major reasons behind his removal is that his wife has filed her nomination against the candiate of SAD’s ally BJP from Ward 73. This happened even after Bedi was given the ticket from Ward 72,” said the source.
 
 A senior vice-president of the SAD, Maheshinder Singh Grewal, said Bedi could have been allotted the party symbol, as he was expelled from the political outfit on the final day of filing nomination papers. 
 
 Grewal said they would be left with no other option but to abide by the election office’s decision at the end. “We will have to follow the rules,” he added. 
 
 Bedi, when contacted, refused to comment. “I cannot talk about it. It was not my decision. I am bust in campaiging at present,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, residents of Ward 72 were confused. 
 
 A local, Jaswinder Singh Bhatra, said it was not clear if Bedi was with the SAD or not. “Well, he’s certainly contesting on their symbol, even after being expelled,” he said.
