TIRUPUR: The state government should abort the one-member high power committee headed by R Santhanam appointed to conduct inquiry into the sex scandal in an autonomous college in  , said   central politburo member G Ramakrishnan.

 Ramakrishnan visited the city as part of May Day celebrations on Tuesday.
 
 “While the allegations were levelled against governor  , how could he himself appoint a committee instead of appearing in the court in the case. Since the act was democratically as well as legally wrong, the government should abort the committee,” Ramakrishnan said.
 
 The former CPM state secretary said, “The state government was involved in malpractices in elections for cooperative societies.”
 
 Later in the evening, Ramakrishnan participated in May Day rally organized by CITU at his party’s north   district office on Avinashi Road.
