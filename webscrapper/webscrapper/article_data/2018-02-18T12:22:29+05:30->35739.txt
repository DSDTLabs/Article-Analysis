Director   has locked the two lead characters for the cinematic version of Benyamin’s novel   –   as Najeeb and   as wife  . The two actors will now devote most of the next year for the film.

 On choosing Amala Paul to play Sainu, Blessy tells us, “Amala is someone who has been noted for her acting calibre. However, not many characters that extract her potential have found their way to her. From the movies I have watched, I think only Mili gave her that platform in Mollywood to perform.”
 
 The actress will be seen playing different phases of Sainu’s life. “The role will be different and challenging from the ones she has done earlier – in terms of how much she can perform as well as the look of the character. But I am confident that she can pull it off easily. Her deep expressive eyes reflect the many dreams and stories that Sainu harbours within her,” says Blessy.
 
 The film will go on floors on March 1 with the first shooting location being Kerala. A source close to the film’s production unit tells us, “After the Kerala schedule, we will be shooting in Rajasthan, Oman and Jordan.”
 
 The entire film will be shot according to its linear narrative. “This movie can only be shot like that. The portions where Najeeb gears up to go to Saudi Arabia and looks healthy will be canned in the first schedule. His emaciated look will only be taken in the latter portions,” says the source, adding that Prithviraj will be dedicating 18 months for Aadujeevitham.
