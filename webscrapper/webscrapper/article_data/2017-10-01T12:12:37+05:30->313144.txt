BHOPAL: In a unique protest tribals in   district of   performed ‘aarti’ of Ravana on Saturday as the state braced to burn the effigies of the Lankan King to mark Dussehra. They are demanding a ban on burning of effigies of Ravana, -a deity- they have been worshipping.

 People assembled at a temple in Chhattarpur village of the district as took part in the aarti, said sources.
 
 “We have been worshipping Ravana since ages. Burning his effigy is a disrespect to our deity,” says Mukesh  , a resident of Chhatarpur village. 
 
 “More than 500- tribals visited the ancient temple on Dussehra. We are not associated with any religious party, but want respect for our traditions,” Dhurve said. 
 
 “Some people are questioning why these protests are being carried out now. We are tribal community and our ancestors were simple people who were not aware of their rights. But since, we are aware about our rights, we cannot let it happen,” he added. 
 
 Earlier, the community had submitted a memorandum to the local administration demanding a ban on burning of Ravana’s effigy.
 
 The tribals also threatened to register FIRs against those burning effigies of Ravana. “We had not received any reply from the district administration. If it continues so, we would intensify our movement,” Dhurve said. 
 
 In the memorandum submitted earlier, the tribals said, “We have been worshipping Meghnad for centuries. Ravan is a Mahapurush and he is not only our king but also our ancestor. During Holi, every year we worship Meghnad. In such a case, burning Ravana as a symbol of victory of good over evil is culturally and constitutionally wrong.”
