 aired two old episodes last weekend and we can clearly see a dip in the TRP's of the show. The show, which used to once be in the TOP 5 list all the time is nowhere to be seen on the list of Top 5 Hindi GEC Programs Urban. The comedy show has been replaced by fiction shows.
 
  Kunkum Bhagya has retained its position for quite some time, and the Shabbir Ahluwalia, Sriti Jha starrer show is number two on the list, which is followed by comedy fiction 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah.' Ekta Kapoor's new show Kundali Bhagya featuring Dheeraj Dhoopar has also performed really well and is already on number four within just two weeks of airing, and Star Plus' Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai is number five on the list.
  
  
 
  
  The   Show has been experiencing a dip in viewership lately because of the host not keeping well, due to which his guests had to return and old episodes had to be aired.
  
  There is a buzz about the channel not renewing his contract, which ended in April. According to reports, the channel in taking time over thinking about to renew the show's contract or not.
  
  
 
  
  Recently, the cast of Mubarkan and Guest in London had to return from the sets of the show after waiting for Kapil for hours and he fell ill and had to be admitted to the hospital.
  
  Ace comedienne Bharti Singh recently joined the team of Kapil and started shooting with them where she is seen playing various characters. On the other hand, Bharti's all time partner Krushna Abhishek has started another comedy show The Drama Company on the same channel which features the likes of Ali Asgar, Sudesh Lehiri, Sugandha Mishra and many more.
  
  Now only time will tell if Kapil is able to retain his show on the channel.
