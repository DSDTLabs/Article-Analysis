LUCKNOW: Five labourers were killed and eight critically injured when a car allegedly driven by the son of late MLA Ashok Rawat in an inebriated state rammed into a   in Hazratganj area on Sunday morning. 

 The MLAâ€™s son, Ayush, and Nikhil, whose father Puneet Arora is a well-known businessman, have been arrested. In their early 20s, both were later confirmed to be inebriated. 
 
 Worse, police said, Rawat did not even possess a driving licence. An FIR was lodged under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and other relevant sections. 
 
 The victims, most of them from Baharaich district in eastern UP, were either daily wagers or rickshawallahs. They were among the 70-odd people sleeping in a temporary night shelter, which was packed beyond its capacity.
