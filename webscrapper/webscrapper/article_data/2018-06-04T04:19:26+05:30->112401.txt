MUMBAI: The city's   ( ) 2034 will come into force from June 23, exactly a month after a notification was published in a state government gazette. But the plan which comes into force will not include the Excluded Plan (EP), for which suggestions and objections are being sought from citizens. 

  The DP is a blueprint for the city's land use for two decades. The state urban development department had issued the notification on sanctioning of the DP on May 8. It had three parts - the sanctioned part (Schedule A), the revised part, called Excluded Plan (Schedule B), and Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) for its implementation.
 
  The EP has newly-introduced provisions and significant changes suggested by  's ( ) planning committee and the state government and had been approved by the civic general body. The Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act requires that the government invite fresh suggestions and objections from citizens.
 
  Till June 22, proposals will be processed under the DP and DCR 1991, but from June 23, they will be processed under DP and DCPR 2034, but again taking into consideration which are the more stringent of the two, which means the DP and DCPR 2034, and EP provisions.
 
  BMC has decided that for proper implementation and guiding architects and staff for processing proposals after June 23, guidelines in the form of a transition policy will be issued. A civic official said the policy should be ready in eight days. "For the EP, the government can either give a hearing or take a decision on it," said the official.
