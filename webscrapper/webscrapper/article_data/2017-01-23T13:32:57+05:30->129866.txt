Actress   says she once had a terrifying sleep paralysis experience during which she feared that she had a stroke when she could not move. 

  
  
 "I had one crazy episode of sleep paralysis. I had actual auditory hallucination. I had just had lunch with  , who is a very good friend of mine, and he'd gone off and I went for a nap, because I was exhausted."
 
 "And I heard him in my hotel room talking to someone and I thought, 'Oh no, they've come in...I went to get up and I couldn't move at all. I thought, 'Oh my God, I've actually had a stroke. I've died...'" Beckinsale said. 
 
 The ' ' was left terrified something bad had happened to her, but was assured by a doctor friend that she had nothing to worry about. "Then I got up and he wasn't in the room so I called a doctor friend of mine - he's a neurologist - and said, 'What just happened to me?'"
 
 "He goes, 'Oh it's quite a common thing, it's what they used to think was a succubus or whatever - you can be in a very particular stage of   sleep and your brain has woken up but your body hasn't yet. So you can't move and people will have visual or auditory hallucinations'," she recalled.
