GANDHINAGAR: In an effort to dent the BJP’s   vote bank, the   has apparently decided to give the community the highest representation in distribution of tickets for the assembly elections. 

 Senior leaders of the Patidar community met Ashok Gehlot in Ahmedabad on Thursday and demanded that Congress field Patels from the highest number of seats. The   assembly has 182 seats. Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot is the new Congress in-charge of Gujarat affairs. Congress MLA from Vijapur (Mehsana) Prahlad Patel also met Gehlot with senior Patidar leaders. 
 
 He claimed that at an earlier meeting, the party’s national vice-president   had agreed to give the community at least 50 tickets.
 
 “We had demanded 60 to 65 seats but Rahulji agreed to field Patidars from at least 50 seats,” Vijapur MLA said.
 
 He further said that during the meeting with Gehlot, state Congress leaders had discussed the community’s “feelings and demands”.
 
 “Gehlotji also said that Patidars will be fielded from the highest number of seats. We have promised that the community will beat the   in winning seats for the Congress. With the support of Patidars, the party will win more than 101 seats,” Prahlad Patel said. 
 
 Supporters of Shankersinh Vaghela protested outside the state party headquarters in Ahmedabad against city Congress president Chetan Raval, and demanded his removal. Vaghela’s pictures were missing in the party posters put up in Ahmedabad recently.
 
 Suspense about Shankersinh Vaghela leaving the Congress to join the BJP continues. Vaghela is expected to meet Ashok Gehlot. It is rumored that he will leave the party along with more than 10 MLAs. Gehlot, however, repeated that Vaghela is very much in the Congress.
