Actor-comedian   has slammed trolls who suggested his mental illness means he shouldn't date singer  .The 24-year-old has addressed misconceptions that have risen since news broke that he was dating Grande following her breakup from rapper  .

 According to reports, Davidson shared a lengthy message on his Instagram Story on Thursday night defending his borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis and his relationship with the "No Tears Left to Cry" singer."Normally I wouldn't comment on something like this cause like f**k you. But I been hearing a lot of 'people with BPD can't be in relationships' talk. I just wanna let you know that's not true," Davidson wrote. 
 
  
  
 "Just because someone has a mental illness does not mean they can't be happy and in a relationship."
 
 "It also doesn't mean that person makes the relationship toxic. Everybody is different and there are a lot of treatments for mental illnesses and I have done/am doing all of them. And I encourage those who struggle to seek help as well it has changed my life for the better.
 
 
 "I just think it's f***ing up to stigmatise people as crazy and say that they are unable to do stuff that anyone can do. It's not their fault and it's the wrong way for people to look at things," he added.
 
 
 He said he is simply writing the message because he wants everyone out there who has an illness to know that it's not true and that anyone who says that is ill.
 
 
 "Mental illness is not a joke it's a real thing. For all those struggling I want you to know that I love you and I understand you and it is going to be okay. That's all. Love to everyone," he added
