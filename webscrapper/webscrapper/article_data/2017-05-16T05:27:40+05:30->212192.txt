VADODARA: A leopard entered a house in the   village of   taluka in   district on Monday morning. It injured two persons in the house after entering it. 

 The leopard had strayed into the house of Raising Baria and injured Raising as well as his brother Virsing Baria. The leopard entered the house at around 8.30am and stayed there till 7.30pm in the evening.
 
 Forest department officials, who had reached the village refrained from launching an operation to rescue to leopard due to extreme heat. This would have irritated the animal if it was caged. Also, a large crowd had gathered around the home making the operation difficult.
 
 Late in the evening as darkness set in after sunset, the leopard walked out of the home on its own and went into the jungle. Raising and Virsing were being treated at the   civil hospital for their injuries.
