NEW DELHI:   on Friday opened higher with the benchmark BSE   rising above 100 points to cross the psychological 34,000-mark on strong global cues. The 30-share Sensex soon after rose to hit all-time high of 34,175.

 The 50-share NSE Nifty was also trading higher above 40 points at 10,548 and touched a new peak of 10,555 in late morning trade.
 
 Brokers said improved liquidity in the market following continuous foreign fund inflows and increased buying by domestic institutional investors after the government moved forward on its bank recapitalisation programme boosted trading sentiments.
 
 At 12.35 pm, the markets had lost some steam but were still going strong above psychological marks. Sensex was up 141 points at 34,111 while the broader Nifty was at 10,538, up 33 points.
 
 On Thursday, both Sensex and Nifty ended on a higher note as state-run lenders rallied late in the session after the government sought approval from Parliament to inject Rs 80,000 crore ($12.62 billion) into the sector as part of its recapitalisation plan.
 
 The benchmark BSE index closed up 0.52 per cent or 176.26 points at 33,969.64. And, the broader NSE index ended 0.59 per cent or 61.6 points higher at 10,504.80.
