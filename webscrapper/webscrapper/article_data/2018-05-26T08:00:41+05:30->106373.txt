PATNA:   branch manager of Bank of Baroda, Alok   (31), was killed for detecting irregularities in the bank and taking against a few in that regard, Jehanabad SP Maneesh said on Friday. “A conspiracy was hatched to murder Chandra as he had unearthed several irregularities in his branch,” he said.

 Chandra was shot dead on NH-110 near Nihalpur under the Parasbigha police station area in Jehanabad district on May 21 morning when he was on way to the branch on a bike from his native Kutri village under the Warisaliganj police station area in Nawada. He was shot four times and three empty cartridges of 8mm were recovered from the spot.
 
 Police sources said the fourth bullet was fired at point-blank range in his right cheek. The SP said the police have zeroed in on a person from Arwal for his involvement in the murder.
 
 “Raids are on to nab him. Some other conspirators will also be arrested soon,” he said, adding Chandra was trailed by three criminals on a bike. 
 
 Arwal SP Umashankar Prasad said the properties of Deepak Sharma’s (42) wife Sinki Devi (35) and his younger brother Rahul Sharma (36) were attached on Friday. He said Chandra had provided crucial information to police regarding embezzlement of Indira Awaas Yojana funds by them. An FIR was lodged with the Mehandia police station in Arwal in this connection in July last year. “Deepak is on bail while his wife and brother are evading arrest,” he added.
