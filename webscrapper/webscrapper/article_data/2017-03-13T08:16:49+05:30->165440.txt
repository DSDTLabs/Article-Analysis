AMRITSAR: With the defeat in the Punjab assembly elections still hurting them, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), being the largest single opposition party, has decided to play a meaningful role.

 “We accept people’s mandate but we are still the second largest party. We will sit in the opposition, be vigilant and play a meaningful and constructive role, which the people of Punjab have not seen yet,” said AAP’s state vice-president (Amritsar zone) Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal while talking to TOI on Sunday.
 
 As against party’s claims of sweeping the assembly elections and forming government, the party could barely mange to win 20 seats, but performed better than traditional political parties, including SAD and BJP.
 
 State vice-president of AAP said that they were yet to hold a meeting to contemplate the reasons for the unexpected performance. He further said that, “I am of the view that people in Punjab are  . Religionism, casteism and groupism have divided the society and people in villages have petty interests and personal rivalries and believe that they can settle scores with the help of leaders of traditional political parties.”
 
 He added that, “For the first time people of Punjab will see an opposition political party in the real sense. Earlier, both Congress and SAD-BJP combine had been playing a friendly match, but we will be vigilant and will oppose any wrong move, both in the assembly and outside.”
 
 Stating that it was a litmus test for state Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh to prove that his party would eliminate drugs from Punjab. “We will see what action he will take against the persons whose name have figured in the synthetic drug racket” he said, adding that if no action was taken then AAP would take to streets and expose the alleged wrongdoings of the new government.
