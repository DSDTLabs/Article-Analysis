She has always been media shy and preferred to be the quiet strength behind her star husband — Jaggesh. Now, 33 years of having been behind the scenes,   will finally be stepping into the limelight. “Recently, I told Jaggi that I’m now ready to step out of my cocoon and he was, as always, extremely supportive of my idea,” she shares.
 An active user of social media, Parimala’s timeline is filled with spiritual quotes, motivational talk and tips on leading a healthy lifestyle. She has now chosen to take this to a wider audience and will shortly debut on television with her own health segment on the popular cookery show  .
  So how did this journey begin? “I have been diabetic for the past 25 years and was on insulin for many years. And despite the fact that I followed a disciplined lifestyle, I wasn’t able to get off insulin. This is a predicament faced by many and that set me thinking. Then, I came across a diet prescribed by a doctor in the UK; it gave me the confidence to make changes in my lifestyle that would also help in giving up insulin. I am happy to say that I have succeeded in my mission,” says a beaming Parimala.
  This was two years ago and it buoyed her confidence enough to dispense health advice and nutrition facts to family, friends and in the past year, on social media, too.
  “I started cooking with local ingredients like millets and imbibing farm fresh veggies. Jaggi realized the impact it made on his health and so did the kids,” shares Parimala. Things have been on the fast track since then and recently she got the call offering her, her own segment on Oggarne Dabbi. “I will be sharing simple tips and recipes which can be made under five minutes. I’m thrilled with the results and our two-year-old grandson has given us further reason to be fit,” sums up Parimala.
  
  Parimala’s easy to follow tips for better health: 
  * Drink warm water with a dash of lime for weight loss
  * Soak chia seeds in water for a few hours and drink it mid-morning for better metabolism
  * Roasted chana and lotus seeds make for an excellent snack
