LUCKNOW: The Lucknow   came to a virtual stand still on Saturday evening after a flight surveillance   that allows an arriving aircraft to spot the runway and land developed a snag. Airport authorities said operations may be stalled until the equipment is repaired. By late Saturday evening at least a dozen   scheduled to land at Lucknow got cancelled. 

 Doppler Very-high frequency Omni-range (DVOR) at the airport developed a snag around 5pm. Two flights from Delhi would have a landed after a while but airport authorities alerted the airlines and the flights got cancelled.
 
 Airport director P K Srivastava said the equipment was being repaired. “We have sought spare parts from Kanpur and Delhi and expect to resolve the issue as soon as possible,” he said. He added that though flights were able to take off, landing was being declined.
 
 Flights which could not make a landing comprised six from Delhi, three from Mumbai and one each from Bengaluru, Kolkata and Patna. Many of the Lucknow-bound flights had to be cancelled. There was no official confirmation if the airport would resume operation even on Sunday.
 
 The Lucknow airport, in all, receives around 25 flights, with seven from international destinations, including Dubai, Singapore and Bangkok.
