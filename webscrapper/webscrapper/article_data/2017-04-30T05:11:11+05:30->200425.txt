THANE: Two commandos attached to the   ( ) of the   saved two children from drowning in a dam in Airoli. 

 The incident took place on Saturday afternoon when the two jawans-Umesh Munde and Shankar Shinde-and their colleagues were training on a hillock near the dam. The jawans had been given a rigorous task of climbing up the hills and then going down. Speaking to TOI, Shinde said that after the pre-lunch session, which started at 8am, they came down around 8am and went to the dam for a swim as it was very hot. "When we were swimming, we saw that some children, aged eight to 10 years, from a nearby village too were in the dam taking a dip," he added. 
 
 When the commandos were about to leave, they heard children screaming for help. Shinde said, "We saw that while some children were on the shore, three of them were deep inside the waters. Before we could rush for help, two of three children lost balance and started drowning. One was already deep inside and only a little away from the danger zone."
 
 "We had already packed up, changed into our uniforms and were ready to leave when we heard the call for help. We immediately dived into the waters again, rescued the two children and brought them to the shore," said Munde. "When we reached the spot where the children were drowning, we asked them to calm down and then got them back," the duo said.
 
 The commandos said that rescuing people had been taught to them during training but this was their first real operation. Shinde said, "We have been taught how to recover things and people from waters, resuscitate victims, provide first-aid, how to enter safe and unsafe waters and how to carry people. We implemented the most basic techniques in this operation."
