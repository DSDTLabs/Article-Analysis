MUMBAI: Dhruv  , an   student from   in  , is wheelchair-bound but his dreams aren't.

 
 "I want do my graduation in economics, with a specialization in Mathematics and Science," he said.   is 85% disabled and bound to a wheelchair for over a decade because of duchenne muscular dystrophy, which causes muscle degeneration. He writes the HSC exam with help from a writer but doesn't need the extra time he can avail of.
 
 The two years of college were difficult but full of fun for Dhruv.
