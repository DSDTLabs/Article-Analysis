Recently, the district magistrate had called a meeting of all stakeholders and directed them to draw up an elaborate plan to improve the traffic situation.
 
 “I met the RTO, SP (traffic), officials from   and others to enforce traffic regulations,” DM Ministhy S said.
 
 Elaborating on the initiative,  , SP (traffic), said, “TRAMO is a mobile unit which will ensure smooth traffic movement on six stretches — two each on NH-24 and NH-58, one on GT road and one on Hapur road.:”
 
 He said that the first stretch would be UP Gate to   cut on NH-24, where mobile units would be stationed. “From Santosh Medical cut to   cut will be another stretch on NH-24; another mobile unit will oversee traffic from UP gate to   via Seemapuri border on NH-58,” Kumar said.
