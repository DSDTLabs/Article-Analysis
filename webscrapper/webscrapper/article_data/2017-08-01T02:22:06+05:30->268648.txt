NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old woman was stabbed outside the Thyagaraj stadium on Monday evening in presence of her daughter while they were returning from a market. She later died at AIIMS. 

 Santosh was walking home with her six-year-old daughter around 8.30pm when she was stabbed five times on the chest and abdomen by a man following a brief argument. The man had allegedly been following them for some time. 
 
 After reaching the gate number 1 of the stadium, Santosh asked the girl to keep walking while she slowed down to check the phone. The accused then came forward and blocked her way near a dark stretch beside a park. He soon pulled out a knife and started stabbing her. Hearing Santosh’s calls for help, her daughter ran towards the killer but he managed to flee. 
 
 A few passersby also came running and informed cops who took Santosh to AIIMS Trauma Centre. “We have registered a murder case and identified a few suspects,” said Ishwar Singh, DCP, south.
 
 Preliminary investigations suggest that the accused was following them on a bike or a car. A CCTV footage shows the woman with the accused carrying a backpack. 
 
 Santosh stayed with her five children at a rented house in Pillanji village. She had told her landlord that she worked at a placement agency and her husband owned a business in Rajasthan but they had been estranged for the past few years. 
 
 The police have found the contact number of a person named Vinod with whom Santosh was in touch till Monday. The probe also suggests that she had a dispute over sharing money with some people.
 
 Following an autopsy, the body will be handed over to family members once they arrive from Rajasthan on Tuesday. The children will also be handed over to them.
