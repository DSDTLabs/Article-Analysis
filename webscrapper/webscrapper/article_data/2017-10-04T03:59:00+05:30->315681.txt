Panaji/Poinguinim: The directorate of panchayats (DoP) is yet to receive a complete report on the constitution of biodiversity management committees (BMCs) by panchayats, as directed by it, even as many bodies formed or reconstituted their panels on Monday. DoP had issued a circular to panchayats to hold a gram sabha on October 2 to comply with this requirement of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. In Canacona, a few panchayats formed their panels. Loliem-Polem panchayat formed its committee headed by Santan X da Costa, Khola headed by Purna Nayak, Poinguinim with Amey Puranik as chairman, Cotigao with Umesh T Gaonkar as chairman, Shristhal headed by Vinay M Tubki and Gaondongorim headed by Suman Gaonkar. Eight village panchayats in Goa have not reconstituted their mandatory village biodiversity management committees as they were constituted a year ago in 2016. These panchayats are Corgao and Torxem village panchayats in Pernem taluka; St Cruz and Chimbel village panchayats in Tiswadi taluka; Tivim in Bardez taluka; Surla in Bicholim taluka; Keri in Sattari taluka and Cana-Benaulim in Salcete taluka.  Of the 191 village panchayats in Goa, two village panchayats — Chandor-Cavorim in Salcete taluka and Chodan-Madel in Old Goa in Tiswadi taluka — reconstituted their mandatory village development committees during the mandatory October 2 gram sabha.
