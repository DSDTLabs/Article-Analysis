It’s all about scaling it up for   movies these days, especially after the blockbuster Pulimurugan. For his upcoming film 1971: Beyond Borders, director Major Ravi had roped in actors such as Arunoday Singh and Allu Sirish. And now, B Unnikrishan, the director of yet another of the superstar’s films, has done one better and cast Tamil star   and veteran Telugu actor   in pivotal roles in the film.

 The movie, which has Mohanlal playing a retired  , would also mark the Mollywood debut of the two actors. “Both Vishal and Srikanth have been cast. I can't reveal much about their roles. The movie has action and suspense and also explores relationship issues,” says Unnikrishnan.
 
 With two prominent actors from Tamil and Telugu as part of the movie, will it be a multi-lingual? “No,” says the filmmaker. “Currently, the idea is to shoot it only in Malayalam. We will decide whether it should be dubbed in other languages only later. Both the actors have signed the film because they have prominent roles with lengthy screen time. Their casting is not a gimmick to make it a multi-lingual but because they were well suited for the characters in the film.”
 
 The director, who had last teamed up with Mohanlal for Mr Fraud, says that the movie will also have a stellar technical crew. “It’s a big budget movie, which has not been attempted before in Malayalam cinema. We are focusing on the technical finesse of the film and have roped in the services of a globally renowned VFX company based in Poland for the CGI department,” says Unnikrishnan, adding that the movie will be shot in Ernakulam, Vagamon and Munnar.
 
 Meanwhile, a source close to Vishal tells us that the actor will join the sets only after a month or so. “He is busy with Tamil movies right now – Thupparivaalan and Irumbu Thirai. The director had narrated a brief of the Malayalam movie and he was excited about getting to work with Mohanlal as well,” said the source.
