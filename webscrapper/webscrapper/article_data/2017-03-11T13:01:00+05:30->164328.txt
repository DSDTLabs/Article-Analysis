HUBBALLI: In an effort to   wilting under the scorching heat, a social organisation, in collaboration with the forest department, has come forward to supply water to ensure their survival in the summer months. The saplings will be watered once every fortnight starting this month, and through April and May. As many as 40 water tankers have been deployed for the purpose.

 Hasire Usiru Green Club in   has also sought help from donors for the endeavor. Secretary of the organisation,   observed that the summer this year was likely to be hotter, owing to successive droughts. “Saplings that were planted recently are dying, owing to the paucity of water. In light of this situation, we have decided to ensure that saplings receive some water,” he added. 
 
 The organisation has been involved in planting saplings across the city for the past five years. “But this year, we are planning on saving those that have already been planted. The forest department has also come forward to help us protect plants and trees from soaring temperatures,”   added.
 
 Admitting that the amount of water the plants would receive from the tankers would not be sufficient, he added, “But it will ensure they survive the summer.”
 
 The organisation’s treasurer Beresh Tallikeri said, “We are spending around Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 on the initiative per month. The forest department has promised to provide staff for the purpose of watering saplings.”
 
 Appealing to citizens to plant saplings in the city, he added, “We welcome donors who will help us in this initiative to protect trees and saplings.”
 
 Range forest officer, Hubballi, BR Chikkamath lauded the initiative undertaken by the organisation. “They are aware of the importance of plants to the environment. Besides saving plants and trees, the forest department can extend its support to such organisations. All citizens must come forward to protect plants, and the environment,” he said.
