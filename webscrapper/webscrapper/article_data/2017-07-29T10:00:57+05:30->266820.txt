CHANDIGARH: A Sector 22 resident was booked on Friday for allegedly stalking a married woman, blackmailing her to get into a relationship with him and, when all his attempts failed, uploading her morphed   on social-networking websites.

 Mohit Goyal is yet to be arrested, even though he has been booked at Sector 17 police station under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354D (stalking), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the   (IPC).
 
 The SHO of Sector 17 police station, Dilbagh Singh, said the accused and the woman became friends on Facebook around a year ago. Later, she alleged, the accused tried to blackmail her to get into a relationship with him by saying that he would upload photographs of her in compromising positions on social-networking websites. When she ignored him, he uploaded her morphed pictures.
 
 She alleged that the accused had also been stalking her from home to work and from work to home. Dilbagh Singh said the woman claimed that the accused downloaded her pictures from her Facebook page, superimposed them on objectionable photos, and shared them on social-network websites. When the woman noticed her pictures, she reported the matter to Sector 17 police.
 
 Dilbagh Singh said the woman had claimed that Goyal had uploaded the photographs to defame her. “He will be arrested after we carry out the initial probe. We have registered the FIR on the basis of the written complaint submitted by the woman,” the SHO added.
