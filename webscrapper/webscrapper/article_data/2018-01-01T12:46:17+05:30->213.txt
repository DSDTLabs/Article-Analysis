VADODARA: A resident of   was nabbed on Saturday night for borrowing money from a doctor at an imaging centre on   posing as a staffer of a Dahod-based doctor. The police are searching for his accomplice who is believed to have masterminded the entire plan.

 Keval Vaghela, who was arrested, and his accomplice   had been borrowing money posing as staffer of Dr Manoj Solanki, who practices in Dahod, since last one year. Police said that the accused Solanki used to call private practitioners in the city and request them that Vaghela, who is his driver, is in city and needs something so if they could lend Rs 1,000 to him. Since the doctors who had lent money knew  , they would lend the money.
 
 But, later when they met the doctor and narrated the incident, the complainant told them that he had never called and asked to lend money to any of his driver. When this happened repeatedly, the complainant asked his doctor friends to inform him immediately if they come across these thugs.
 
 On December 27, Vaghela went to Dr   of the imaging centre as Dr Solanki’s driver and asked for Rs 1,000. Shah immediately called the complainant and asked him about it. When Dr Solanki said that he had not sent any driver and asked Shah to not lend money, Vaghela left from there.
 
 But, Vaghela again went to Shah’s clinic on Saturday evening and told him that Dr Solanki’s car is out of fuel and he needs Rs 500 to refuel it. Shah contacted the complainant and also the police, who reached there and nabbed him.
 
 A police official investigating the case said that they went to other accused’s house in Gorwa to nab him, but he was not found there. Cops are interrogating Vaghela on how the duo got contact numbers of Dr Solanki’s friends in city and the purpose for borrowing the money.
