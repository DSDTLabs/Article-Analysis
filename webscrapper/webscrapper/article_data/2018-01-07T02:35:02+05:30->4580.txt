NEW DELHI: One of the main suppliers of bullets to the city’s gangs has been arrested by the Special Cell on Friday. The suspect had managed to dodge the cops for a very long time, but in a recent operation near Kalindi Kunj, two people were arrested and 1,300 cartridges seized.

 Police found that the men were kingpins of the conduit who would procure   from gun-sellers in western UP and sell them to criminals at a higher price.
 
 DCP, Special Cell, P S Kushwah said the men, Prempal and Netarpal used to run the conduits through a network in Delhi and NCR. During interrogation, Sandeep another gang member, had disclosed that Prempal was one of the biggest suppliers in north India.
 
 “A trap was laid near the Meethapur road in Kalindi Kunj and two men travelling in an SUV were intercepted. When the police team asked them to stop, the accused opened fire. In retaliation, cops fired back. The men were overpowered and arrested,” said DCP Kushwah.
 
 Probe revealed that Prempal was a wrestler and used to practice at an Akhara in Aya Nagar in south Delhi where he came in contact with some arms suppliers who introduced him to the suppliers in UP. Netrapal alias Masterji is a relative of Prempal and has been assisting him in arranging the supply. 
 
 Police are now looking for some other suppliers who had links with the accused. The names of the arms dealers have also been shared with the authorities in UP.
