PUNE: The 'acute brain infarct' is 'tiny' in size and may not cause developer D S   any identifiable neurological dysfunction, experts said.

 Besides other physiological reasons, such tiny infarct may result from low blood pressure following a low intake of food and fluids, they said.
 
 Sassoon General Hospital’s medical board on Tuesday confirmed that Kulkarni had ‘acute tiny infarct in the left posterior parietal lobe of the brain’ or a minor stroke based on a clinical examination and the report of magnetic resonance imaging that developer Kulkarni underwent at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, on Monday.
 
 “The tiny infarct in parietal lobe falls in the higher cortex which interprets information. So DSK may suffer some spatial disorientation like difficulties in figuring out where he is and the time,” neurologist   said.
 
 Some reading difficulties and confusion in the left and right side coordination is possible,   said. “These complaints are transient. They will resolve after treatment,” he added.
 
 Once the infarction or blockage has occurred in the brain, it remains there for life and nothing can be done after the first six hours of a stroke.
 
 “A clot buster drug, if given within four and half hours of the stroke, can help dissolve the clot in some cases. But if the medicine is not given within this time-frame then the blockage may remain for life. It is unlikely to cause him any further problem as the surrounding arteries compensate for the blood flow in the area surrounding the infarction,” Deshpande said.
 
 Kulkarni has diabetes and is hypertensive. “Both put an individual at an increased risk of stroke,” senior physician D B   said.
