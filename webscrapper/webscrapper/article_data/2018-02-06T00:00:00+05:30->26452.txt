Looks like   has pulled off a casting coup. We hear that the National Award-winning actor, who made his debut as a director with last year’s warmly received Pa. Pandi, has managed to rope in Tollywood superstar   for a crucial role in his next directorial. Dhanush had announced the project in Dec 2017 and had mentioned that will be playing the lead role. A little birdie informs us that Mega Star has agreed to be part of the film. 

 Sources close to the production are tight-lipped about this development. While the actor-director did not revert to our text asking for a confirmation, when we reached out to Hema Rukmani, whose production house is producing the film, she maintained, “We haven’t announced who the cast of the film is, so only when we do it, we can confirm it.” 
 
 However, sources close to Chiranjeevi, in Hyderabad, admitted that talks are on for the actor to star in Dhanush’s film, adding that the details are yet to be firmed up. Meanwhile, there is a rumour that  , who was last seen in Thozha, has also been approached, and might star in the film, if   is unavailable. Dhanush is currently acting in Balaji Mohan’s Maari 2, which went on floors this January, while Chiranjeevi has been shooting for the period film,  , since December 2017.
