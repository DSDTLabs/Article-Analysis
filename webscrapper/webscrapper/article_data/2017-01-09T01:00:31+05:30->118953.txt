We are immersed in the Margazhi season, and the kutcheris and dance performances at various sabhas are on, in full swing. And if you are a patron, you might be aware that this season is also the best time to flaunt your best Kanjeevaram saris. Marrying the love for silks and the music season, an event in the city saw the launch of a sari collection (titled ‘concert collection’) , exclusively designed for the music season. Sahithya was spotted looking gorgeous in a yellow and pink sari, with musical notes sequined into the pallu. Singer-musician Sriram Parasuram, also the husband of popular singer Anuradha Sriram, was also present at the event.
