MUMBAI: TOI’s report on March 8 on the shunting of an   who questioned the basis of the discount on the land allotted to Baba Ramdev’s   has triggered a public interest litigation alleging irregularities in the deal.

 Mumbai Congress chief   has filed a petition in the   claiming that the land was allotted at throwaway rates and demanded that the deal be cancelled. The petition also asks for an inquiry into the allotment. It says the 600 acre of land allotted to Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd is part of forest land which should not be used for development. The respondents to the petition include Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.
 
 The petition points out that the though the prevailing rate of the land was Rs 1 crore an acre, it was allotted to Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd at Rs 25 lakh per acre.
 
 Referring to the  , the petition says, “an officer concerned raised an objection in respect of the sale but despite this, the Union and state governments proceeded to allot the property to Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.” It adds, “Initially the price of the land was quoted at Rs 2,500 per sq m. This was subsequently reduced to Rs 1,500 per sq m and then to Rs 625 per sq m without any basis. The officer who raised the objection came to be transferred immediately which speaks for itself.”
 
 The petition says Gadkari held a press conference and announced the government’s decision to allot land to Patanjali Ayurveda even before inviting tenders. “This shows that the allotment was pre-decided and the entire process of bidding was merely a formality,” the petition claims.
 
 It also questions why a waiver was given to Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd when the company is worth more than Rs 5,000 crore. The petition also alleges that the government showed “unnecessary favour” to Patanjali Ayurved Ltd and that the bidding process was just a formality.
