CHENNAI: The fully unreserved, long-distance,   trains got a little closer to reality with union minister of railways   dedicating a rake of 22 coaches in New Delhi on Wednesday. The coaches unveiled in Delhi were manufactured by the Integral  .

 The railways is planning to introduce seven trains including two via Tamil Nadu very soon for passengers who travel using general class tickets. The trains which will have better amenities like mobile charging points, potable water and toilet occupancy indicators will be operated on routes favoured by people who do not prefer reserved class travel.
 
 Santragachi-Chennai Central weekly Antyodaya express and   will run via Tamil Nadu and are expected to cater to the hundreds of passengers who currently struggle to travel by unreserved trains on the Chennai-Howrah route.
 
 A senior railway official said that the ministry has not announced a date for commencing the services. "There has been a huge demand for unreserved travel on these two routes. As the trains are classified as superfast, passengers will have to pay slightly more than the regular general class tickets."
 The railways had also operated special trains using unreserved coaches on these routes because of the demand.
 
 Other facilities include fire extinguishers with anti-theft lock, fibre reinforced  , pleasing interior colour scheme, LED lights, slip-free flooring at doorway and gangway, and anti-graffiti coating for exterior painting which will help in easy maintenance.
 
 The coaches will also have vestibules for internal movement of the passengers. These features are not available in unreserved coaches of express trains.
