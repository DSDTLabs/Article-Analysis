Indore: Hundreds of parents and guardians were seen outside various school campuses car-pooling and bike-pooling across the city on Wednesday.

 On the second day of the ongoing auto-rickshaw and  , parents had to alter their schedules to pick and drop children to the school. It has added on to the woes, especially of those who stay on the outskirts of the city.
 
 It's easier said than done, said parent   who had to come from his office to pick his and his neighbours kids and drop them all the way to   road.
 
 "My neighbour, and I have been coordinating to pick and drop our children. I have taken a two-hour break skipping my lunch to drop the kids," he said.
 
 Blame the hectic schedule or long distance most of the parents hire auto-rickshaws and vans for their children.
 
 As the parents are coming to pick students, it has not only disturbed their schedule but also added to the traffic jams in the vicinity of the schools.
 
 After receiving a message from the school to avoid coming by car as it will add to the traffic jam, parent, Jitendra   had to go back home to keep his car and come by a two-wheeler to pick his kids.
 
 "Apart from wasting my time by travelling extra 15 km to drop kids, I will be taking a bigger risk of taking three kids on one bike," said Sharma who seemed frustrated about the decision of the collector.
 
 Owing to the rush in and across the campuses, one of the biggest tasks for the parents was to look for their children.
 
 Nobody bothered to check anything, now after the accident, they're making such strict amendments without thinking about the repercussions that the parents will have to face, said parent Anil Kaushik.
