 MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has asked the chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of various public sector insurance companies to consider a representation calling for implementation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes’ recommendation to review their promotional policy so as to benefit people belonging to SC/ST communities.
 
 Petitioner All India SC/ST General Insurance Employees Welfare Association general secretary (All India) V Ponnusamy pointed out that nothing had materialised despite the commission asking New India Assurance, National Insurance, United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and General Insurance Public Sector Association to review their new promotional policy. 
 
 According to him, the   held a meeting on November 28, 2007 at which finance ministry’s insurance division joint secretary and department of personnel and training secretary as well as the chairman-cum-managing directors of the afore-mentioned   participated. The commission had enquired about the new promotion policy brought out by the insurance firms including Oriental Insurance. It apprehended that SC/ST candidates would be deprived of promotion due to the new system and thus wanted the firms to review the promotions made from 2001 onwards. It also demanded that the new promotional policy be reviewed in such a way that the candidates belonging to the SC/ST get the benefit of protection in promotion to the higher posts. 
 
 It also said that the review exercise should get completed before December 31, 2007 and the commission should be informed about it. But, there had been no change in the promotional policy so far, the petitioner said. 
 
 He had sent many representations to them in this regard, which included the last one sent on March 15 last. Accordingly, Justice   directed the officials to consider the representation.
