HYDERABAD: Tempers flew thick and fast at a public hearing organised by the   ( ) on Thursday, to discuss the government's ambitious flyover project around the  . While authorities, pushing for the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP), insisted that the proposal would de-congest traffic travelling towards the city's western corridor, activists present at the meeting weren't amused. 

 Even owner - whose properties located around the park have been identified for land acquisition to pave the way for SRDP - raised questions over the need for a multi-crore flyover project, considering the upcoming metro rail is likely to pass through the same stretch.
 
 The total cost of the metro project is pegged at around 14,000 crore while the SRDP - around the KBR alone - is estimated to cost the government 500 crore (approx.). 
 
 "There were many of us who questioned the officials about the purpose of the project. Many also asked them why the opinions of regular citizens weren't sought on the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) study that has been drawn up to justify the SRDP," said a property owner on condition of anonymity. The SIA has been conducted by the Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI). It maps the impact of the flyover project on six junctions around KBR and identifies the extent of land around these sites that the government will have to acquire for the project. "The SIA is only a small part of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), which is extremely important considering that the project will have a direct adverse impact on the health of the national park," rued   of Hyderabad Rising, the citizens group that's dragged the authorities to the   to protect KBR from the SRDP.
 
 When contacted, GHMC officials, predictably, refuted any such altercation and insisted that the SRDP would certainly be rolled out if the verdict in the NGT case was in their favour.
