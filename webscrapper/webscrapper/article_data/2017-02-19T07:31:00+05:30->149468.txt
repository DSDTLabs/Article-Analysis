DHARAMSHALA: Unable to get an Indian Passport issued in his name despite high court directions, a Tibetan activist-in-exile,  , has filed a contempt petition against the government of India and police officials of   for not granting him the same.

 Tibetans living in India are given a “green book”,which acts as an identity card for being registered as a refugee in India and a “yellow book” that acts as a passport. Wangyal told TOI that Tibetans, who want to travel out of India, face a lot of problems in getting visas and other travel documents in the absence of a passport. 
 
 It was in September 2016, following the petition of Wangyal, that Delhi high court held a decision, directing the officials concerned that he was an Indian citizen and was entitled to all benefits and privileges as are available to Indian citizens.
 
 “After the judgment I had applied for the same at the passport office in Shimla. But still I was not issued one as the officials concerned asked about my permanent residency,” said Wangyal, adding that he lived in a rented accommodation but had PAN and voter identity cards like other Indians. He was born in Odisha in May 1970. 
 
 He said that the petition had been submitted and the hearing of the case was on February 21. 
 
 Interestingly, in 2014, the   had allowed Tibetans in exile and their children born in the country from January 26, 1950, to June 30, 1987, to register as voters for the general election. It was issued following a ruling of the Karnataka high court.
