MAUR (BATHINDA):   are suspecting the role of four pro-Khalistan terrorists in the Maur Mandi car blast that left six dead and 14 injured.

 Lahore-based Khalistan Zindabad Force chief Ranjit Neeta’s name has figured among them. Neeta, a native of Jammu and Kashmir, was involved in the attack on Gurdwara Nanaksar in Vienna in 2009. He was listed among India’s 20 most wanted persons by the CBI in 2008.
 
 The cops’ suspicion about Pakistan-based groups assumes significance as only two months ago another jailed terrorist and   (KLF) chief Harminder Mintoo had escaped from the Nabha jail. He was later arrested from Delhi railway station. Along with Mintoo, five gangsters who had escaped from the jail on November 27, are still at large.
 
 According to sources, Mintoo, who is a diploma holder, had undergone training with Khalistan terrorist Jagtar Tara, who was involved in the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi region.
 
 In fact, Mintoo’s second-in-command Harmeet alias PhD, who is also living in Lahore, is the second key suspect as several calls between Mintoo and his aide were found on Skype from his diary inside the prison.
 
 Another ultra, who had recently got bail in a case related to the assassination bid on Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, is also on the list of suspects. He was facing 20 terror-related cases at the time of his arrest in 2012. He was released in 2015.
 
 Police claimed that similar modus operandi was used in attacks between 1990s and 2000s by the Pakistan-based terrorists.
 
 “A small car with a remote-controlled IED and less use of RDX have been the common modus operandi in the vehicle blasts. This attack is just one of them,” said a senior cop. The engineering background of several terrorists helped them in assembling the bombs.
