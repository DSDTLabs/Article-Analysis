AHMEDABAD: After witnessing a relatively lean season following implementation of Goods and   (GST), jewellers are hopeful that the festive season will help revive demand for gold.Gold imports in   increased marginally from 0.64 MT in August to 1.30 MT in September. Even though imports have nearly doubled, the volume is significantly less. Sha ring reasons for this, Jigar Soni, a city-based jeweller said, “The beginning of September fell in the Shraddh period, which is often considered inauspicious for   purchases.Routine sales have begun since  . There is no significant rise in gold jewellery demand.“
  traders claim that consumer demand is low due to a subdued consumer sentiment. “As gold transactions have been brought under Pre vention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), sales have been low and people are avoiding high-ticket purchases,“ said another city-based jeweller.
 
 Prices of the yellow metal stood at Rs30,500 per 10 gram on Monday . Jewellers, in fact, are hopeful that the demand will pick up around the festive season as a lot of auspicious buying takes place on Pushya Nakshatra, Dhanteras and for some, even on   and New Year.
