RAIPUR: The four day sports event at National Institute of Technology( NIT) Raipur, SAMAR-2017, came to an end on Sunday with much pomp and show. The event, that had kicked off on February 15, was filled with four days of action packed sport activities and fun events, marked by excellent performances by students. 

 Wrestler   and ace hockey player   graced the closing ceremony as chief guests and also gave away prizes during the Unnati awards distribution function. They offered words of advice, inspiration and motivation to the students.
 
 Geeta urged the youth to have faith in their parents' visions and dreams, calling her own father's role as being one of the most important in shaping her successful career. "I used to perceive my father's discipline and approach as 'hanikakark' or harmful for us. It was much later that both me and my sister realized how his approach helped us achieve success and fame," Geeta said.
 
 Referring to a particular scene in the biographical movie 'Dangal' , Geeta said, " The scene where me and my sister beat up some boys, triggering a realization in our father that girls can wrestle too, is a part of fiction. The truth is that on one occasion, I hit my cousin very hard, choking him. It was then that I realized that I could be a wrestler like my father." She also instilled faith and hope in the hearts of ambitious young women, telling them to dream big and work relentlessly to achieve that dream.
 
 Geeta Phogat, who is presently serving as Deputy Superintend of Police (DSP) in Haryana, added that both she and her sister are now furthering their father's dreams by setting eyes on gold medal at the Olympics.
