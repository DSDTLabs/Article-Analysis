PATNA: Two People’s Liberation Front of India ( ) extremists, Sonu Kumar and   Rai, made an abortive bit to escape from a prisoners’ bus after hurling two low-intensity bombs inside the vehicle in which they along with 16 other inmates were being transported back to the Beur Central Jail from a court in Patna on Tuesday afternoon.

 The incident took place near   on NH-30, 3km from the jail. Four suspected PLFI members riding two bikes and brandishing pistols also tried to intercept the bus. But even after the explosions injured an inmate and a policeman, the undeterred driver sped away and reached the prison with all the occupants.
 
 Preliminary police investigations hinted an SI leading the escort party played the middleman to supply four explosives and two countrymade pistols to the extremists after procuring them from PLFI members on the court premises. 
 
 Sonu was the state unit chief of PLFI and was arrested from   near Ranchi railway station on September 6, 2015 in connection with an explosion at a flat at Bahadurpur Colony in Patna on March 30, 2015. It later turned out the flat was being used as a storage house by PLFI. Sikandar was arrested from   police station area in 2016.
 
 A senior police officer said the SI’s involvement came to light following interrogation of Sonu and Sikandar. “A bomb detection and disposal squad later recovered one live bomb, a countrymade pistol and two cartridges from the bus. The SI has been detained,” the officer said, preferring anonymity.
 
 Patna zonal IG N H Khan said 13 policemen and seven special auxiliary police personnel were suspended. Also, a move has been initiated to terminate the services of six home guard jawans.
