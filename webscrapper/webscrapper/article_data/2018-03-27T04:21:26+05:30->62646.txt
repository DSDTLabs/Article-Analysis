 on Monday asked the state and the   to consider if it wanted to change the reservation of two plots in   and   so that these could be used to rehabilitate encroachers removed from near Tansa pipeline. 

 The plot at Marol is reserved for a cancer hospital, while the one at Dindoshi is reserved for public housing. A division bench of justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla said the authorities would have to either change the reservation or find another place to rehabilitate these encroachers.
 
 The state had allotted allotted 11,633 flats in Evelsmile Layout at Mahul to project-affected persons, including nearly 6,000 families of the Tansa encroachers. But the rehabilitation plan has been stuck following orders of the   over pollution in Mahul.
 
 The court said its orders for removal of encroachers could not be put on hold as it concerned the security of the city and water supply to its residents. 
 
 In 2009, the high court had ordered removal of slums on the pipeline and called for maintaining a buffer zone. Of the 160 km of water pipleline running through the city, around 90 km is above ground. In an affidavit in 2009, the corporation had admitted to around 15,000 illegal structures on the pipeline. Since 2009, the number of encroachers has been over 60,000. 
 
 The court has asked the state to file an affidavit on the issue before April 20, the next date of hearing . At an earlier hearing on a plea by the encroachers who had opposed the relocation to Mahul, the court had directed chief secretary Sumeet Mallick to come up with a practical solution for rehabilitation.
