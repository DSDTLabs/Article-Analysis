PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   Rail Corporation (Maha-Metro) has started geo-technical work on the   elevated   near Nashik phata in   

 This includes sampling and testing of different kinds of soil to know their strength, compressibility and characteristics, which would influence the construction of the pillars.
 
 The Pimpri Swargate metro corridor is 16.59km long of which a 7.15km stretch falls in Pimpri Chinchwad limits.
 
 “The work is being done along the main divider of the Pune-Mumbai highway near Nashik phata,” said Brajesh Dixit, managing director, Maha-Metro.
 
 Apart from the grade separator (main corridor), there are service roads with BRT lanes on both sides. The pillars, each 15m high, will be erected on the road dividers between the BRT lane and grade separator from Pimpri to Dapodi. The elevated stations can be accessed through elevators and escalators.
 
 Initially, the pillars were to be erected on the pavements from Pimpri to Dapodi. However, the BRTS department officials said that the footpath width will reduce, and also that the existing utility lines will need to be shifted. The service road would also reduce in width, causing frequent traffic congestion along the stretch.
 
 In March, the BRTS department had made a presentation on the revised alignment of the metro route to the then civic chief Dinesh Waghmare, Maha-Metro chief Dixit and other senior civic officials of the engineering department. Maha-Metro had in the first week of April approved this new alignment as it was technically feasible.
 
 From Pimpri to Swargate, the metro stations in PCMC limits include Pimpri (the main PCMC office building), Vallabhnagar ST bus depot (Sant Tukaramnagar), Kasarwadi railway station (near Forbes Marshal company), Phugewadi (near old Octroi post), and Dapodi (near Arun theatre).
