HYDERABAD:  , the flag-bearer of Indian contingent at next month’s Commonwealth Games suffered an injury scare at the end of her practice session here on Tuesday. While trying to return, she tripped and hurt her ankle.

 
 
 
 The shuttler was helped off the court by coach   and physio Gayathri Shetty. Sindhu was in tears as the concerned support staff applied ice packs.
 
 Fortunately for Sindhu and India, the MRI was negative for serious injury. “Thankfully, there is no major injury,” Sindhu told TOI. “I am relieved and since it’s not a major injury, I’ll resume practice soon,” said Sindhu.
 
 
 
 Gopichand was a relieved man too. “She will be in good shape for the Commonwealth Games,” he said.
 
 Sindhu’s father PV Ramana said: “It was just a mild sprain. She will start practising again from March 29. Initially, I was a bit worried as she has injured her ankle a couple of times before. Before the Rio Olympics, she had recovered from a major leg injury. Thank God there is no such thing now.”
 
 The badminton team event at the Commonwealth Games will be held between April 5 and 10. The individual women’s singles event starts on April 11, which gives Sindhu two weeks to get back in shape.
 
 While Saina Nehwal won the CWG gold in 2010, Sindhu won bronze in the last edition at Glasgow in 2014. “We are leaving on April 1 and I want to do well and win the event this time,” Sindhu said.
