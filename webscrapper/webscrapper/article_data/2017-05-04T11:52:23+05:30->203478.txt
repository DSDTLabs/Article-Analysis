NAGPUR: “Swami Vivekananda believed that education is the manifestation of perfection already present in a human being. He always thought that gaining knowledge should be central to education,” said Yajuvendra Mahajan, an educationist, on Tuesday.

 In recent times, education has become a   business as parents want their children to study in a particular way whether or not they get knowledge. This needed to be changed, he said. 
 
 Delivering a lecture on ‘Pratyekache Vivekananda’ organized as part of ‘Abhiwadan Shewalkar’, a three-day programme to pay tributes to the noted littérateur at Rani Laxmi Lawn, Mahajan said that instead of forcing their views on children, parents should allow them to choose the profession they like. 
 
 Mahajan said that Vivekananda’s work was not limited to any specific religion or caste. “He always spoke of universal brotherhood as he had a broader view of the ideal society in which we should live. The swami was of the opinion that every person is born to achieve greatness. It therefore becomes imperative for us make India a land where knowledge, peace and goodness coexists,” he said. 
 
 Mahajan, also a social worker, said that people are becoming increasingly selfish and hardly look beyond their family which will do no good to the society. 
 
 “They need to change their attitude and work selflessly for the society. People remember Swami Vivekananda,  , Dr   and Mahatma Gandhi because they worked tirelessly for the uplift of the society,” he added. 
 
 Present on the occasion were   and Pankaj Mahajan.
