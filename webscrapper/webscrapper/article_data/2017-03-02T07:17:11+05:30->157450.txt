NEW DELHI: As many as 39  , comprising 21 civil prisoners and 18 fishermen, whose nationality has been confirmed by Pakistani authorities, were repatriated to Pakistan via Attari-Wagah border on Wednesday.

 TOI had first reported on Tuesday that India was going to release the prisoners, who had served out their sentences, and fishermen and repatriate them to Pakistan as a goodwill gesture.“The government of India attaches highest importance to addressing all humanitarian matters, including early release and repatriation of all eligible Indian civil prisoners and fishermen,“ the foreign ministry said in a press release.
 
 Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's recent gestures, including the release of Indian soldier   and more than 200 Indian fishermen, led to the “reciprocal action“ by India. Pakistan, was looking for a “small beginning“ from India in the form of release of its 33 prisoners, who, it said, have completed their sentence in India.
 
 Prisoners are only released after they meet three conditions--completion of prison sentence, no pending case and confirmation of nationality -officials here said.
