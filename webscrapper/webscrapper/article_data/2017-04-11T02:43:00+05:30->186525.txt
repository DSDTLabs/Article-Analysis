Kolkata: The charred body of a 67-year-old man was found by morning-walkers at Narayanpur playground near the airport on Monday. The victim was identified as Biren Pal, who lived a few blocks away from the playground.

 A can of kerosene and some matchsticks were found near his body. Those who identified him ran to his house and informed his son, who was still sleeping. He took him to Barasat district hospital where doctors declared him dead.
 
 Police said the man was suffering from liver cancer for last few years and had depression. Cops suspect he committed suicide by pouring kerosene and setting himself ablaze. However, his body was sent for post-mortem for confirmation.
 
 “Of late, the man was advised not to eat anything solid. His health was failing and even his family was under financial pressure,” said an officer of Airport police station.
 
 Police suspect Pal had quietly stepped out of his home at Dinesh Pally in Narayanpur sometime between midnight and early morning with the jerrycane of kerosene and set himself ablaze after walking to the playground. A case of unnatural death has been started and cops interrogated his family members and neighbours on Monday.
 
 Two months ago, a south Kolkata neighbourhood had witnessed a similar sight of a woman burning herself to death at a community playground in Bijoygarh.
