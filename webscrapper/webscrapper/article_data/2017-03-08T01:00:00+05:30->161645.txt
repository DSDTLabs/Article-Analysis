Anyone who has seen the title track of ' ', that releases on March 10, will agree that   and   have set the dance floor on fire. Bring that up with the actress, and she says with a blush, “I have done song and dance before, but I agree that it was nothing like this. I worked hard on ' '. I focused on my nakhras and my body language a lot. And I’m glad it is showing. Also, I think the reason this song got hugely noticed is that I haven’t done too many dance numbers of late. I did films, which didn’t have room for a dance number so to say. So, our title track looks very refreshing. I’ve put in a lot of energy as well. I really wanted this song to look and feel great.”
If the title track made   feel refreshed after a bevy of heavy films, there was a song that made her and the entire crew rather emotional. Believe it or not, it was 'Tamma Tamma Again'. The actress believes it’s one of her best memories of working on the romantic drama, produced by Dharma Productions. “We technically wrapped up the film with 'Tamma Tamma Again',” recalls Alia, adding, “So, the minute Shashank (Khaitan) called ‘cut’ on the last frame, the whole crew got emotional. And then, the track was played all over again, the shooting floor turned into a dance floor. Everyone from the spot boys to the director danced to the number before we called it a day.”
