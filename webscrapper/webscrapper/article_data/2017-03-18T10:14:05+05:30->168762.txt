PUNE: The hardship faced by tourists, especially foreigners, in paying for entry tickets at several monuments post demonetisation has prompted the   (ASI) to mull installation of point of sale (POS) machines at all ticketed monuments in Maharashtra.

 ASI plans to install more than one POS machines in several monuments in the state, including three each in Ajanta and Ellora caves, four each in   and  , and two each in Elephanta caves, Shaniwarwada and  , among others.
 
 ASI officials said that service provider banks have been told to install POS machines at the ticketed monuments on priority.
 
 A senior ASI official in Mumbai circle told TOI that the installation of POS machines in all ticketed monuments in Mumbai circle is under process. “We approached a service provider bank a month ago to work out the modalities of the plan. Problem of Internet connectivity in monuments, which are mostly located in isolated areas, is also being worked out,” the official said.
 
 B G Yelikar, conservation assistant, Pune sub-circle of ASI, said that he recently contacted a service provider bank for installation of POS machines and an Internet service provider in Shaniwarwada. “Though machines have not been installed yet, they will be soon. We have had a couple of instances in the past when visitors did not have change to pay the entry fee, hence the need for POS machines. Once the machines are installed, all tourists would have to do is swipe their plastic money and the entry fee would directly come into ASI’s account,” he said.
 
 There are over 285 monuments under ASI in Maharashtra, but only a few of them are ticketed. Currently, POS machines are available at ticket counters in Delhi’s Red Fort and Qutub Minar. Officials said the machines will be first installed at all world heritage sites, followed by other ticketed monuments.
