NEW DELHI: The   has announced that starting April 1, it would bring all girls studying in government schools in the city under the   scheme. 

 “For this, the government will set aside Rs 50 crore,” said Atishi Marlena, the adviser to deputy chief minister  . She added that the Delhi government would bear any additional expense incurred. 
 
 Until now, only students up to Class VIII are covered under the scheme. Government officials said once this scheme is in place for the girls, it may be extended to the boys as well. 
 
 The government has also claimed that it would be the first state to extend the scheme up to Class XII. 
 
 The Centre gives over Rs 95 crore in aid to the Delhi government every year to serve midday meals from classes I to VIII. Explaining the reason for the expansion, Marlena said that many students had approached their teachers and principals asking for meals. “They come from deprived backgrounds and malnutrition is a big problem among them. With the extension of this scheme, that can be addressed,” Marlena said. 
 
 The government, Malena said, has also decided to include bananas and eggs to increase the protein content of the meals.
