Kolkata: As part of its nationwide crackdown, the enforcement directorate on Saturday conducted raids on more than 75 companies in the city. Six of them allegedly have links with   MP and YSR   leader  . Another company, believed to have links with Maharashtra politician  , is also being looked into. 

 Shell, or fictitious, companies are non-trading companies used for various financial maneuvers or kept dormant for future use in some other capacity.
 
 Over past several months, the ED has been closely tracking   companies and made a database. The exercise picked up pace after a lot of shell companies turned active post demonetisation. 
 
 “A large chunk of these companies is registered in Kolkata. While some of them are non-functional, many of them are used mainly for tax evasion and money laundering,” said an ED official. 
 
 According to an income tax official, the department has so far detected more than 17,000 shell companies in Kolkata, but there could be more. “Most of these companies are used for layering the amount to be laundered. Most of the companies are run by entry operators who carry out book adjustments for the companies and launder money,” said the official. Many such companies flourished in 2010-11 and peaked in 2012-13. 
 
 Speaking about Saturday’s raid, an ED official said: “In most cases, there was no physical existence of the companies although they existed on paper. In some cases, they were simply drop-box companies,” said an ED official. While the raid continued till late Saturday night, ED officials did not rule out chances of further raids over the next week.
