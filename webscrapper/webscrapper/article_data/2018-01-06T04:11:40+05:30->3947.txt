NEW DELHI: Dr  , a Delhi-based disability rights activist, took to Twitter on Friday after he was allotted middle and upper berths despite booking a ticket under the disability quota.

 Singh, who suffers from polio in the legs and requires a wheelchair to travel, has booked a ticket for four people from Udaipur for an overnight journey on   on January 6. While Singh, an associate professor at   in DU, has tagged the authorities, he is yet to get a lower berth.
 
 “Even after booking the train ticket on the disability quota, I was allotted only upper and middle berths. For how long will people like me suffer? I will file a complaint under the disability act,” Singh told TOI. 
 
 Replying to Singh, the railway authorities tweeted that while seats were allotted automatically, they often gave appropriate seats to such passengers on request.
 
 Singh said, “It has taken us nearly seven months to get our e-concession forms online and we have to fill up two more forms to book a ticket online under the quota, yet nothing is being done to ensure that we are allotted lower berths.”
 
 A few months ago, the then railway minister, Suresh Prabhu, met disability rights activist and international para-athlete Suvarna Raj to take suggestions for improving travelling conditions of the differently-abled.
