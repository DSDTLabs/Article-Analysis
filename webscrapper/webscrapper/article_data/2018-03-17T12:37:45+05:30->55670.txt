LUDHIANA: Polythene and plastic products manufacturers met Punjab   (PPCB) chairperson K S Pannu on Friday and demanded that the ban on manufacturing of polythene of 50 microns and more should be lifted. 

 Close to 100 businessmen led by Gurdeep Singh Batra, president of Plastic Manufacturers and Traders Association (PMTA), held a detailed discussion with Pannu on the issue and informed him that the industry was already suffering huge losses and if the ban was not lifted several units would be shut permanently. 
 
 Batra said their industry had been in the red into perils ever since the ban on manufacturing of polythene bags of any kind was put on by the state government. “Though officials earlier kept claiming that the ban orders were issued on orders of the Centre, only polythene bags of density below 50 microns have been banned,” Batra added.
