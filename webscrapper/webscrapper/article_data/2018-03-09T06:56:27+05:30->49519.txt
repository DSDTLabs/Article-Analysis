NEW DELHI:   said TDP’s exit from the Modi government was evidence that PM   loathed the plurality of India but the party’s Andhra unit said CM   was smarting under a hit to his “personal interests” which he had cleverly covered as a crusade for the state.

 Praising Naidu for his decision, Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “He was the first one to speak against the PM when Modi was the CM of Gujarat (over riots under Vajpayee regime of which Naidu was convenor). He showed courage of conviction and has now seen the futility of continuing in alliance which seeks to trample upon the rights of  .”
 
 However, Rajya Sabha MP KVP Ramachandra Rao dismissed Naidu’s claim that he had exited the government over denial of special category status for the state.
 
 “Naidu accepted special package in place of special category status so that he could spend the money as he wished. But the Centre is asking for utilisation certificates, audits; it is scrutinising the prices quoted in contracts. Naidu did not like this. It started with water resources minister Nitin Gadkari asking questions about prices and contracts in Polavaram project. It was the first crack in the coalition,” Rao said.
 
 Claiming that there were no “ideological differences” in Naidu’s revolt against BJP, Rao said   had been a partner of the saffron outfit multiple times.
 
 In contrast to its state leader, Congress said, “A parochial, autocratic alliance led by PM Narendra Modi could never accept divergence of opinions which is the essence of India’s foundational values and the splintering of NDA is only a reflection of that philosophy of PM and the BJP.” Congress said the BJP’s oldest ally Shiv Sena had already declared that it would have no truck with BJP while BJD had also dumped the saffron party.
