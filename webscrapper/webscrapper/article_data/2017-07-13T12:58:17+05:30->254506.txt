BHOPAL: Realising how tough it is to drive through the pick-up-and-drop lane outside Raja Bhoj airport in the stipulated six minutes, authorities have decided to act tough against taxis and other vehicles that hog much of that space. 

 Come Thursday, airport authorities will impose a fine of Rs 250 on such vehicles parked in that area. TOI has drawn the attention of decision makers to trouble the presence of such vehicles cause to flyers in no-parking area. Given the way taxis and other vehicles block the lane, it’s almost impossible to move out of the area in six minutes. Once the time is over, parking charges are applicable. 
 
  told TOI that violators will be fined from Thursday. “We tried everything to keep vehicles away from the non-parking area. We had no option except to start imposing fine against such violators,” Mathur said. 
 
 There are separate lanes for pick and drop vehicle and others. “There are 6 minutes for the pick and drop. We have started making lane free of traffic. However, no parking will be allowed in front of the arrival terminal,” said Mathur. He said photos of cars parked illegally would be sent to traffic police.
 
 A   and drivers screaming expletives to clear the way with a guard whistling in vain — this was a common sight at the airport. 
 
 Though vehicles are not allowed to stop in front of exit gate or entry gates of the terminal, it was hardly ever followed. From the parking lot, one should walk down almost 300 to 400 metre to reach the terminal through an elevated curve. As the distance is more, people instead of parking the vehicle in designated parking lot take them to the pick-and- drop lane, adding to chaos.
