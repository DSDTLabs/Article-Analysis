MUMBAI: India’s much-awaited first private moonshot by   has suffered a major setback with   recently scrapping the rocket deal with the space startup. This may deal a deathblow to the venture’s attempt to enter the   Lunar XPrize competition. People close to TeamIndus said the Bengaluru-based company was not giving up yet.

 
 In December 2016, TeamIndus said it had firmed up an agreement with the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) which stipulated that the advanced version of its four-stage rocket — the Polar   Launch Vehicle, designated as Pslv-XL — would be used for the private moonshot. The total cost of the mission was about Rs 450 crore, and the cost for contracting Isro’s PSLV-Xl was about Rs 150 crore. This alliance showed signs of cracking up from the beginning, mainly for financial reasons. Isro and TeamIndus declined to comment on the development. Insiders in both organisations confirmed to TOI they have parted ways for the moment. TOI’s email query to TeamIndus founder and chief Rahul Narayan has not been answered.
 
 The Google Lunar XPrize competition envisaged teams landing on the moon by March 31, 2018, their rover moving 500 metres on the lunar surface and transmitting high-resolution images and videos to the ground stations. The winning team gets an award of $20 million. TeamIndus had two rovers to be flown to the moon — one of its own, HHK, and a Japanese rover, Hakuto.
 
 Inquiries said the launch contract that TeamIndus signed with  , the commercial wing of Isro, was cancelled because of inadequate funds. Recently, Sheelika Ravishanker of TeamIndus Foundation said at an event in Mumbai that TeamIndus plans to launch a crowdfunding programme for the moon mission.
 
 Speculation is rife in the past few months that the government was keen that Isro’s second mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-2, with a lander and rover, should land on the moon before TeamIndus. Chandrayaan-2 is slated for launch between March and April.
 
 The reasoning was that since Chandrayaan-2 was a government mission, it should beat the private organisation in leaving its footprint on the lunar surface. “The Chandrayaan-2 mission was publicised before TeamIndus was announced. The government would have been left with egg on its face if TeamIndus had gone ahead of Isro,’’ said a space expert. Technically, he said, TeamIndus was doing well. Indirect pressure had started to build on TeamIndus. It is said Isro wanted to know details about the payloads being carried by TeamIndus since the rocket belonged to Isro.
 
 “It was the government’s negative attitude which affected the TeamIndus mission. If it had been accomplished, it would have been a morale-booster for the youth of India to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics,’’ the space expert said.
 
 TeamIndus can still achieve its moonshot with a different rocket from abroad.
 
 In October 2017, a team from Google Lunar XPrize reviewed the progress of TeamIndus and expressed confidence to the media that TeamIndus was ready for the moonshot. The media was shown the lander, rover and the new hi-tech control room at the TeamIndus headquarters at Jakkur in Bengaluru. TeamIndus has for long maintained in its Facebook and Twitter accounts that it was ready to head for the moon.
 
 Of the 33 teams from 17 countries that joined the Google Lunar XPrize competition, five remain. But most of them are facing problems.
