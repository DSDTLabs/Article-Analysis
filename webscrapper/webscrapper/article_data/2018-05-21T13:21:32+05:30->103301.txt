Yash doesn’t believe in cheat days — when it comes to diet or exercise. “I was in London for more than 15 days and I maintained my diet and exercise routine. Cheat days give me a feeling that you are doing something forcibly but trust me I love to exercise and I love what I eat (boiled chicken without salt, veggies and fruits only) . The audience pays to watch us on screen and I feel it is my duty to look good on screen,” said the actor who is currently dubbing for Fidaa slated to release this Eid.
