Box-office wars are so last century. For filmmakers today, digital is the word. With the audience looking for a break from soaps that thrill less and drain more, there's an infectious verve of change in the way we look at entertainment. Egged on by the success that many Indian   tasted in recent times, three of our filmmakers -Sujoy Ghosh, Pratim D Gupta and   have joined hands to make episodes for a national channel that will later find their way to the internet. Though I am not sure if it's a joint project, each is involved in the other's venture in their own capacity. Pratim, I hear, has already shot his episodes with   in the lead.This collaboration comes after their Maacher Jhol. The content is both entertaining and engaging and it is going to be one helluva experience for Kolkatans when the trio completes the projects. I can't wait to see what's in store.
