KOZHIKODE:  , which has been enjoying an unchallenged monopoly in the state’s cooperative dairy sector, would soon have a rival.

 Another cooperative behemoth from the state, Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society Ltd ( ), the state’s first labour cooperative and one of the largest cooperative societies in Asia, is set to enter the milk processing sector.
 
 ULCCS chairman Rameshan Paleri said the society will set up a high-tech dairy plant with a capacity to process one lakh litres of milk per day in Kozhikode district, which will be up and running by October 2018.
 
 ULCCS was entering the field as there was a huge scope for value addition in the dairy sector, which will also help the dairy farmers, Paleri said.
 
 Dr T P Sethumadhavan, former director of   at   and   (KVASU) and currently director of UL Education, said the society plans to sell 20% of the plant’s output as pasteurised milk in the retail market and to convert the remaining 80% as value added products like probiotic milk products, cheese, yoghurt, lassi etc.
 
 “There is huge demand for such products in domestic as well as international markets,” he said.
 
 The ULCCS was planning to invest Rs 15 crore to set up the plant, he said.
 
 ULCCS Ltd, founded by eminent social reformer Guru Vagbhatananda in 1925, is now one of the top construction firms in the state and has registered a turnover of Rs 650 crore during last fiscal. The society’s diversified interest now includes UL CyberPark, the first IT park to be set up by a labour cooperative society and   (ULTS) which provides IT solutions and UL Education.
