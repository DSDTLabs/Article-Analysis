RAJKOT: A 65-year-old farmer,  , died of   a   organised by people of five villages located on the outskirts of Rajkot city against relocation of maldharis or cattle rearers, to their villages. More than 50 farmers from  , Maika, Khedi, Hajapar and Targadiya villages had gathered at the Rajkot collector’s office on Friday with their cattle opposing the   for maldharis.

 Last year, the civic body had begun a special drive to expedite the process of relocation of maldharis and their cattle outside the civic body’s limits. About 1,658 maldharis had given consent for relocation outside Rajkot city.
 
 The issue of having a maldhari vasahat (society) had been pending since a long time. RMC had offered land and other facilities to maldharis who were willing to relocate with their cattle outside city. Under the scheme, each cattle owner would get 25 sq m land to construct a house and space to keep the cattle.
 
 On Friday, people from five villages where land was allocated for relocation of maldharis, gathered at the Rajkot collectorate along with their cattle as a mark of protest. During the protest Prabhat Lavadiya (65) of Bhichri-Amargadh village complained of chest pain and collapsed. He was rushed to nearby private hospital in 108 ambulance, but he was declared dead on arrival by doctors. 
 
 Following death of Lavadiya, villagers went back to their villages after submitting a memorandum to additional collector Harsad Vora. In the memorandum, the villagers alleged that if maldharis are relocated there it would adversely affect their farming and livelihood. About 561 maldhari families with 7,634 cattle are set to be relocated in the five villages which already has a population of over 21,000 cattle.
 
 Villagers feared that relocation of maldharis will create friction between villagers who are mostly Patels, Ahirs and Kolis. They alleged, the cattle of maldahris would destroy their crops and affect livelihood.
