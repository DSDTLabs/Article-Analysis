CHENNAI: In the lead-up to the  , the confidence with which   has carried himself has been palpable. While he doesn’t seem to be shy of expressing himself, his belief has definitely gone up by a few notches recently. It’s perhaps down to what transpired in November last year when he won his maiden   title beating   and   en route to victory. During that memorable week, he was also acquainted to  , brother of the illustrious David Ferrer, and has now brought him on board as his new coach.

 
 
 “I have started working with Javier since the end of the Australian Open. It’s only been a couple of weeks. I’m enjoying the sessions I’m having with him. I was earlier working with Argentinian Mariano Delfino. He was busy with family commitments and wasn’t able to give the time required. So we ended up splitting,” Nagal said.
 
 In the short time they have had together, Javier has already identified the 20-year-old’s backhand as an area that needs strengthening. “Sumit is an extremely bright prospect. He’s very young and has a lot of time to improve. He can attack with his forehand whenever he likes because that’s his strength. His backhand, however, needs improving. He doesn’t have a bad technique. It’s not as strong as his forehand. He needs to be more aware when to play it. He also needs to improve his condition,” explained Javier.
 
 The Spaniard will no doubt strive to work on some of these aspects, but he will also have to simultaneously find a way of managing his busy schedule. The 40-year-old, after all, continues to accompany younger brother David, who remains active on the circuit despite issues with his form lately, on tour.
 
 “I have to travel with David and other players too. I will be travelling with Sumit regularly from here on, but the only problem is I need to manage my time. I also coach Pedro Martinez, who is also here in Chennai,” Javier added.
