PATIALA: Taking note of alleged errors in `Mahankosh',  , the   has asked  , Patiala to look into the matter and take immediate action. The officiating   said it was a “non-issue“ but they would look into the matter.

 The CM described errors in the `Mahankosh' published by Punjabi University as unfortunate and asked the VC to take action. The CM's letter reached the university after SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar filed a complaint with him and demanded ban on the sale of `Mahankosh' published by Punjabi Univer sity. Principal secretary, high er education and officiating vice-chancellor S K Sandhu visited Punjabi University on Tuesday and held meetings with university professors and other faculty members to take a decision on the issue of a ban on `Mahankosh'. But no decision was taken.
 
 Replying to a query on the SGPC's demand for ban on the sale of `Mahankosh', Sandhu said, “It is not a prestige issue for anyone. Bhai Kahan Singh is very widely respected and there's no doubt he gave excellent content of literature like mahankosh. We are looking into the matter.“
 
 Recently , the four-member committee of the SGPC completed its inquiry over published copies of `Mahankosh' and found a number of errors, following which SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar demanded ban on its sale. Badungar alleged that the university published mahankosh in English, Hindi and Punjabi with errors. He also demanded a probe to ascertain if the professors who translated and published `Mahankosh' were Sikh intellectuals.
 
 Meanwhile, Sandhu said he joined only 10 days back and would soon make decisions but only to come up with an interim arrangement as such an important decision of the university should be taken by the regular VC, who would probably be appointed by the month-end.
