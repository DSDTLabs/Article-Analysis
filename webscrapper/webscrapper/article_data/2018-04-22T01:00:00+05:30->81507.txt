A social club in Kanpur recently organised a   theme party for its members. The members of the club, following the theme, came dressed as the British spy and Bond girls. "We all have grown up watching James Bond movies. He is the most stylish character and that's why we planned this party," said Nitin Gupta, one of the key organisers of the party.

 The venue was beautifully decorated with huge posters of James Bond, cut-outs of playing cards, balloons, red and white flowers.   and Tanvi made an early entry and were soon joined by Chetan and Chandani. The guests also brought toy guns as party props and were seen posing like James Bond. But this was not the end of the entertainment, a performance of Russian dancers added to the glamour. Neha, Chanakya, Piyush, and Pallavi were seen enjoying the dance performances.
