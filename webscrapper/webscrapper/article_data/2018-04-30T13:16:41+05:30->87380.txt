PATNA: The best time to update wardrobes is here and residents of the city have begun switching to the classic fabric – khadi. From different and exquisite hues to various patterns and textures, the glorious fabric of khadi not only adds to the style statement, but also offers relief from soaring temperatures.

 The city markets are adorned with a wide variety of khadi apparels, such as scarfs, kurtas, saris, pants and lot more. S K Gupta, director of Bihar Khadi and   ( ), said the demand for khadi has increased over the past few years. “The sales see a jump in October when discounts are offered on khadi apparels and products,” he said.
 
 Another official manning a KVIC unit on Maurya Lok premises, however, said the annual khadi sales were below target this year. “The counter sale from April 2017 to March 2018 was around Rs 1 crore. The total sales stood at just Rs 3.9 crore,” he said, adding the counter sales would increase from May.
 
 Dr Rajesh Sinha, a dermatologist at   ( )-Patna, said, “Khadi is the best absorbent of sweat. Khadi and cotton fabrics consist of larger space which provides passage of air. Since other fabrics have comparatively lesser space, they fail to provide much comfort. Khadi is the most comfortable garment during the summer season as it keeps away skin diseases that arise from excessive perspiration.”
 
 Tahir Ansari, manager of one of the shops at Dak Bungalow crossing, said the contemporary style has made a comeback and demand for khadi is increasing gradually. “More and more workers from rural areas are being engaged in the process of making fabric,” he added.
 
 Sukriti Alani, who visited one of the khadi stores on Maurya Lok premises the other day, said, “Khadi has become trendier. It is a very light garment and easy to carry in extreme summers and humid conditions. There are so many different patterns and designs available in the market, like the chequered ones that are best for making short pants or shirts,” she said.
