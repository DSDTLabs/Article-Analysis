Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government’s decision to implement provisions of free admission to poor kids under the Right to Education Act (RTE) may not be a disappointment for too many applicants, even though the system drew flak from various corners earlier.

 Against the allocation of 63,593 admissions to poor kids at private schools in class I, some 34,840 admissions have been confirmed on the penultimate day for securing admission under RTE. A couple of thousands more may be added, as nearly 9,500 applicants had objected to their being ward allotted a particular school.
 
 In Ahmedabad city, 10,581 students were allotted admission at private schools, but only 3,907 parents secured admission for their children till date.
 
 For some 63,000 seats, the government received 81,258 applications for free admission for poor kids at private schools. However, education officials believe nearly 18,000 seats may remain vacant after this round of admissions and the 17,000-odd extra applicants will likely get a chance to secure admission for their kids.
 
 Explaining why so few applicants secured admission, director of primary education, M I Joshi, said, “There is a very strong preference for particular schools among applicants. When the schools of their preference are not available, they do not bother sending their kids to the other private schools in their vicinity.” Education authorities have reserved May 25 to address some 9,000 objections made to allotments at particular schools. They believe the genuine objections are those over an unreasonable distance to the school from the kids’ homes, the medium of instruction, minority institutions and cases where boys were allotted girls schools and vice versa.
