BATHINDA: To analyse the voting pattern in the February 4 assembly elections in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party has convened a meeting of all its candidates and volunteers in Nakodar, near Jalandhar, on Sunday. AAP Punjab affairs in charge Sanjay Singh, organisation building head Durgesh Pathak, state convener Gurpreet Waraich, Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann and   lawyer HS Phoolka will interact with party leaders and workers. This will be the first such massive volunteer exercise by any political party in Punjab after the elections.

 The party also appealed to party volunteers to not hang their boots and remain “battle ready”. A senior party leader said, “Leaders will interact with candidates and party activists to get feedback about the voting pattern. We will also prepare a strategy in case AAP wins a majority.”
 
 AAP’s Kotkapura candidate Kultar Singh Sandhwan said apart from getting feedback about voting pattern, the party would also discuss preparations for the upcoming Delhi municipal corporation (MC) elections and Gujarat polls later in the year. “We have not hung our boots yet and are still in battlegear. The party will also analyse the shortcomings in Punjab,” he said.
