 and Neeraj Pandey, one of the finest actor-director combinations in  , have collaborated once again, this time in the capacity of producers, on 'Naam Shabana'. Akshay and Neeraj have together brought quality cinema to the audience. Their previous outings include 'Special 26', 'Baby' and 'Rustom', all of which have been critically and commercially successful.

 Coming back to the Shivam Nair-directorial, which releases on March 31, it is a spin-off on Shabana, Taapsee Pannu’s character in Baby. 
 The 2015 action spy thriller was appreciated for its content and slick direction by Neeraj. Akshay’s performance was lauded, too. Taapsee’s 20-minute action-packed role was also well-received, which prompted the makers to come out with the upcoming film.
 
 The film revolves around the circumstances that fuel Shabana’s determination to become a special agent. Taapsee has undergone intense training in martial arts to play her character convincingly. 
 
 While Akshay,   and   join her from the cast of Baby, Manoj Bajpayee and Prithviraj are the new entrants on this ‘special case’.
