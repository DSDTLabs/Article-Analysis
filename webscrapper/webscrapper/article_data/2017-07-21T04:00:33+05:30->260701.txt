I was immersed in work when I heard my colleagues screaming that the building was on fire. In a bid to find an escape route, one of us opened the main door to our office. A blanket of smoke covered the corridor. Nothing was visible. We closed the door and huddled ourselves in one corner, waiting for someone to rescue us. 
 
 I suffer from asthma and that whatever little smoke I had inhaled while trying to get to the stairs had started bothering me. Memories of the   fire on Park Street started haunting me. The main electric connection was switched off by then. With no ventilation, we were getting suffocated. I was running out of patience as I got held up with nine other colleagues.
 
 Out of desperation, I started banging on the glass facade to break it open. But it was too tough to break. I ended up injuring my hand. We remained trapped for close to an hour. Every one of us started praying. That is when fire brigade personnel managed to rescue us. They led us to safety through the stairs.
