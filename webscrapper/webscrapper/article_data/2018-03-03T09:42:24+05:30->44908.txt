PANAJI: Due to the lack of funds, the government’s plan to have one old age home in every taluka will have to wait for a while.   minister Francis D’Souza said the plan has been put on hold, though temporarily, as he could not discuss the proposal with chief minister   prior to the budget due to latter’s sudden illness.

 “I was scheduled to discuss my proposal with the chief minister, but could not do so due to his illness,” D’Souza said adding that he is nonetheless positive that the plan would materialize sooner or later. The existing old age homes, D’Souza said, are not adequate to accommodate the increasing number of senior citizens. 
 
 The new homes D’Souza has in mind, he said, are more in line with modern homes that have come up in some parts of the country which focus on giving inmates a feel of being in one’s home while meeting their basic needs for help. These modern homes are built keeping in mind the prime requirements of senior citizens such as in-house medical facilities and recreational facilities, while also providing a sense of privacy to inmates.
 
 The minister, however, was unclear about whether they would offer the facility free of charge or some fees will be payable. He said that since most people who come to provedoria homes are penniless, it’s doubtful whether they will be able to pay even the minimum charges.
 
 “Those who can afford to can go to stay in private old age homes,” D’Souza said.
 
 There are about 30 old age homes across the state including those operated by private parties. Provedoria operated old age homes have inmates who are poor and have none to look after them. They are also referred to as homes for the destitute. Most provedoria operated homes are very old with sparse basic facilities.
