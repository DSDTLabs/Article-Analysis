PANAJI: Deemed as a new discovery as far as cold seeps are concerned, the   (NIO) aboard its research vessel  , was able to locate active cold seeps in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of India.

 These cold seeps are associated with shallow methane gas hydrates. The hydrates, according to NIO director  , can serve as a source of alternative hydrocarbon energy. “There are approximately 1,900 trillion cubic metres of methane gas hydrates in the Indian EEZ. If we can tap even 10%, we can take care of the next 100 years of energy resource in our country,” he said.
 
 
  
 
 NIO formulated a strategy using modern tools like water column imaging, parasound sub-bottom profiler, and precise-seabed sampling protocol on board the vessel to study the materials.
 
 Sampling of the seabed sediment led to the discovery of active cold seeps. These cold seeps are characterised by emission of methane, mounds of calcium carbonate and hydrogen sulfide gases from the seabed, which support an extreme ecosystem. This ecosystem consists of a variety of macrofauna, including clams, mussels, crabs and polychaete worms.
 
 The endemic macrofauna are known as chemosynthetic communities as they have a symbiotic relationship with the micro-organisms dependent on methane and hydrogen sulfide for their survival. 
 
 Singh said it was a matter of marvel that these species are able to exist in an environment that is otherwise toxic for survival of other marine organisms. There is a potential to discover new bioactive compounds which may find application in medical research, he said.
 
 “This work has put India on the global cold methane seep map. It’s a hotspot of biodiversity and has remarkable ecology within the sediment area,” NIO principal scientist A  , said.
