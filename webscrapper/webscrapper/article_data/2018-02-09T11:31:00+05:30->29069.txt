CHANDIGARH: Come Monday, getting   approved will be a click away. To spare city residents of the ordeal of running from pillar to post to get their building plans approved,  , finally, launched the ambitious online building plan approval system, which will be made available for general public from February 12.

 Online building plan, one of the key components of the ease of doing business, has been marred by delays. The administration had been working on the project for over one a year.
 
 Till now, residents had to submit their building plans along with prints of drawings, which are processed manually. Due to human intervention in the process, it took more than three months to get the building plan sanctioned. Complex bylaws and approval procedures led to subjectivity in interpretation, thereby, leading to delay, which led to the loss of revenue for authorities.
 
 Under the new system, all the plans will be automatically scrutinised of drawings vis-Ã -vis building bylaws. The system will help in expediting the scrutiny process by eliminating lengthy and cumbersome manual process.
 
 Under the system, the owners of the buildings and architects will be able to submit the application for the sanctioning the building plan in online mode from anywhere. The system will enable the applicants to track the status of the application through SMS, email alerts and MIS reports. The system will also act as interface to higher authorities for overall monitoring.
 
  administrator VP Singh Badnore and UT adviser   expressed happiness and appreciated the initiative of launching the system.
 
 The system will bring transparency in the processes and enable the applicants to access the application anytime from anywhere. 
 
 Lauding the efforts put in by the officials of estate office, city-based architect Vinod Joshi said that the system will go a long way in expediting the process of approval of building plans.
