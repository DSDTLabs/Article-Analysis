Ahmedabad: Examination observers are under suspicion so far as Gujarat University’s complaint with regard to the leakage of question papers for First Year BCom examinations is concerned.

 Even as the city crime branch has initiated an inquiry on GU’s complaint, the university authorities are simultaneously trying to find out the leakage point.
 
 GU officials said that the top authorities suspect involvement of observers who are tasked with carrying copies of question papers to examination centres. This is not without a reason. The photographs of question papers found on social messaging site in students’ mobile phones had the cover in the background, and the cover had GU watermark. Things became more curious because the authorities had sensed a leakage a few days before the final phase of exams began last week.
 
 Instead of sending question papers in sealed covers, GU took precaution and put the sealed cover in a steel box with a lock. Since the photographs of question papers revealed sealed covers as background, it has strengthened GU authorities’ suspicion that observers could be involved in the leakage.
 
 GU authorities do not rule out the possibility that the rift between groups of academicians and administrators could have played a role in the paper leak.
