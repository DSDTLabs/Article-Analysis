Muktsar: Farmers of water-logged areas of Muktsar district have taken to shrimp farming for extra income. Five farmers of the district earlier this year had started the fish farming and on Wednesday undertook fish harvesting in the presence of deputy commissioner Sumit Jarangal. The first produce brought happiness on the faces Harpinder Kaur and Juginder Kaur of Koliawali village.

 On the occasion, Jarangal said, “The project was started by the government this year and bumper production in saline water has brought a new hope for the farming community. The results of the first year are encouraging and traders from Delhi have come to buy fish from the farmers at attractive rates. This year five farmers had taken to fish farming and we hope that nearly 50 farmers will adopt it from the next year onwards. Income from this is more than the traditional farming. Four months ago the seed was brought from Tamil Nadu and now the crop is ready for harvest.” 
 
 Farmers Harpinder Kaur said, “The cost of production for shrimp farming per hectare is very high but the income is also good. The state government has helped us reap gold from useless wasteland.”
 
 Another farmer and Fateh Singh, “This crop has generated profit in about 4 months and farmers can reap rich harvest as the shrimp can be kept in waste land with saline water.” 
 
 Assistant director (fishery) Karamjit Singh said, “Shrimp farming can be done in the area where salinity of water is more than 5 ppt. There is saline water in Muktsar and fish farming in the district can become a major source of income for farmers. About 90% subsidy is being given to dig ponds for shrimp farming whereas 50% subsidy is being given for the purchase of seed feed and other equipment. Fish of about 12 lakh can be produced from one acre.”
