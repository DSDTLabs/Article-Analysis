GHAZIABAD: Scores of Class X and XII students along with their parents on Sunday staged a protest at a school in Kavi Nagar over “cancellation” of their registration by the CBSE ahead of the board exams, which starts from March 5.

 The students alleged that as the schools where they are actually enrolled do not offer Class X and XII, their registration for the CBSE examination has been done through Holy Angel’s   by their respective school management through an “internal” agreement. But, when they approached Holy Angel’s Public School to get their  , the school management said they were unaware of such an agreement. 
 
 Seema Tyagi, president of Ghaziabad Parents’ Association, said, “The future of 94 students studying in four different schools of the city is at stake. They have been left in the lurch by both—the schools where they are actually enrolled and the Holy Angel’s School.”
 
   , a Class X student of Maharaja Convent School, Vijay Nagar, said: “Our school lied to us that it has recognition till Class X. Every time we raised a query about our admit cards, the school management told us that we would get them at the appropriate time. It was only a few days back we were told about the arrangement with Holy Angel’s School..”
 
 Siddharth Jain, owner of Holy Angel’s Public School, refuted the allegations. “These 94 students are not from my school. I do not know why the management of other schools are taking my name. The parents of the students do not have any document to prove that they are registered with us.” 
 
 CBSE regional officer Ranveer Singh blamed both parents and schools. “We have released admit cards of all those students whose applications have come through proper channel. The local administration should look into this matter,” he said.
