CHANDIGARH:   from   from an adjacent ground hangs over a big part of the RBI (Reserve Bank Of India)   in Sector 44-B for almost six months now. 

 The dirty water has submerged this section of the park completely. A small stream of it is running into the colony, too. The sludge is coming from a punctured sewer line. The gutter to which this line is connected has its lid removed and dumped over the ground’s pavement. “This sewage has been overflowing for six months or even more. In summer, the smell was so unbearable that we cannot explain,” said Sanjeev, a nearby vendor.
 
 The flow of water varies from time to time. Sometimes the pressure is higher, and at other times comparatively lower. “The smell is disgusting,” said Sanjeev. The odour had forced him to move his roadside shop a little further to avoid the constant pollution caused by the leaking sewage. Flies have started breeding in the stagnant water accumulated on the ground.
 
 “The leakage is said to have started after the laying of new underground cables by telecom operator Vodafone about seven months ago. There was no problem like this before. They must have punctured the sewerage pipe while laying their underground cables,” said Santosh, a nearby resident. A couple of  , who were confused about the source of foul odour in the park, said they suffer it during morning and evening walks.
 
 A gardener working in the park for a long time says the leakage has opened an irrigation channel to the plants. “I diverted the water to the flowerbeds, not knowing until today that this was from sewerage. I thought why waste the water when I could water the plants with it.” 
 
 When asked if anyone has filed a complaint with the  , a roadside barber working next to the point of leakage said: “I have requested many people over these months to lodge a complaint but all of them just promise to do so. No improvement has happened, so far.”
