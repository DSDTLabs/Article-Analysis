MUMBAI: With the Supreme Court of India categorically stating that  , the former president of   and ex-chairman of the   (ICC) cannot be involved in the affairs of the game, and a host of state associations also voicing their opinion on the same lines, the senior administrator from Tamil Nadu has left on a holiday to the United Kingdom.

 At the Special General Meeting (SGM) of the BCCI, scheduled on May 7, the   ( ) will be represented by its secretary  .
 
 With Srini away, the rejigged think-tank of the Indian cricket board is now coming together on the idea of staying united as far as the battle with the ICC is concerned. It is learnt that the BCCI mandarins are all set to take up the matter involving the ICC with a top minister in the central government at the earliest and are waiting to hear on the date of an appointment.
 
 The board's view is that the financial loss being caused by the ICC's decision to bring about a policy change in revenue distribution will lead to the state exchequer losing close to Rs 2000 crore through foreign exchange and further, it leading to a huge loss in terms of the taxes to be paid on the income. "It's a loss to the government and it needs to be pointed out in absolute clarity. Not just the BCCI's state units, even the Centre will lose money. It's shocking how certain people are viewing this new revenue sharing model as a means to justifying hiked remuneration for countries like Afghanistan and Zimbabwe. We want to improve on our own infrastructure and some people want to go around distributing it to others," another administrator said.
