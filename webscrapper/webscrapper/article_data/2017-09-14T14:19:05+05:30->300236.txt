NAGPUR: Putting the 107km Nagpur-Nagbhid narrow gauge railway line conversion on the right track, the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra cabinet on Tuesday approved over Rs354 crore for the project.

 Of the 628km narrow gauge network under Nagpur division   (SECR), only Nagpur-Nagbhid is pending for conversion.
 
 The decision on Nagpur-Nagbhid gauge conversion was announced in 2013-14 railway budget at an estimated cost of Rs401 crore. The project was to go ahead with necessary approvals.
 
 In 2013, the state had agreed to share Rs188.11 crore of the tentative cost of Rs376.21 crore by the railways. However, as per the Railway Board’s advise the abstract cost of the project was revised to Rs708.11 crore based on the project’s terms of reference (TOR) which included additional cost of gradients, bridges, signalling, mechanical, electrification etc.
 
 According to divisional railway manager (DRM)   Agarwal, SECR general manager had sent the revised project proposal to the   for approval on May 6, 2015.
 
 “The above work is to be executed on 50:50 sharing basis between the state and railways. In April 2017, we had submitted revised estimates for consent of the state government. Now that the Maharashtra government has approved its 50% share, the project will get a big boost,” said Agarwal.
 
 The state will start allocating money for the project in phases from 2018-19 budget. According to railway officials though Maharashtra has agreed to share 50% cost, it will need to send a formal approval letter to be forwarded to the Railway Board.
 
 They added the project at present doesn’t have NITI   permission. Now getting Aayog’s nod will be a mere formality. It will include all clearances.
 
 As the sanction is to be communicated, railways too has not spent any money on the project. The broad gauge will mostly boost freight and passenger traffic. There are many coal mines in this section and railways will tend to benefit from transportation of coal.
