PATIALA: The arrival of the plane is likely to give the much needed boost to flying activities at the   air strip.

 The half-a-century old club had in March received two new Cessna-172 aircrafts. It already has two Cessna 152 (1984 mode) aeroplanes since 1990 and one Cessna 172R since in 2008. While Cessna 172R (taken on lease by the club from the Aero Club of India) is operational, the other two planes had been grounded and were being used only for ground-training practices. 
 
 The two new Cessnas were assembled at the Patiala airstrip after an approval from the Director of Civil Aviation ( ).
 
 It is after a gap of almost 40 years that the club, which at one time used to have a fleet of 12 aeroplanes, has received new planes to keep itself afloat.
 
 The new multi-engine Tecnam PP 2006 has been bought by the   (PSCAC) from   and was flown in from   to New Delhi, where after inspection it was allowed to be flown to Patiala on Friday.
