HYDERABAD: Only 144 out of 322   in Hyderabad district have been granted affiliation for the academic year 2018-19, till date. Announcing this on Saturday, district Intermediate education officer of Hyderabad, B  , said that the applications of 178 colleges are still pending due to non-submission of necessary documents. 

 "We urge parents not to rush in yet and seek admission for their wards in Intermediate colleges, as many applications are still under process. It's too early to say whether these colleges will be given affiliation. It would be wise for parents to wait till the board releases an admission notification on May 21," said the  .
 
 For many colleges in  , the fire   has turned to be a major hurdle, particularly the corporate institutes, as they are unable to furnish the same.
