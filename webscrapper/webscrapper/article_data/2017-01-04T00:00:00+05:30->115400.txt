While thin chokers, with or without charms, are great for casual outings, the thicker ones are best for a dressed-up look.
  beauty  , who was recently spotted rocking a thick   choker during a high-fashion event in Bengaluru, says, “The colour gold is big this year, be it in clothes, accessories, hair or makeup. So, I was not surprised when (designer)   Gupta made me wear a choker for her show. However, what was surprising was that she made these chokers from the border of a Kanjeevaram sari! I think that the choker goes wonderfully well with Indian and fusion clothes.”
 You can make this at home. All you need is a fabric of your choice, a pair of scissors and a clasp to make your own version.
