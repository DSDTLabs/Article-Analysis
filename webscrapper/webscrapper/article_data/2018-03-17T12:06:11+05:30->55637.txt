Son of actors Jayaram and Parvathy,  , who stole the hearts of Malayalis as a child actor has now grown up into a big boy and a hero. His debut movie as the lead,  , directed by Abrid Shine hit the theatres on March 15. As the actor is being judged and scaled for his acting, he sits with us for a candid chat.

 We listen in...
 
 
 
 
  
  I am extremely happy hearing the responses. Most of the audience feel nostalgic about the youth festivals they were part of and those who have no experience of the vibrant youth festivals of Kerala, are enjoying the novelty of it. For me, it is the result of my work and the wait for years. 
 
 
 
 Yes, the time taken is worth as we have not missed even the minute details of the story and each frame is picture perfect. I enjoyed the entire process of waiting and making of Poomaram. 
 
 
 
 
 
 It was challenging to play a character that I am completely new to. But the rehearsals and the interactions with the campuses here really helped me to get into the character. I lived like a college boy of Kerala being with the students of different colleges here during the rehearsals. It really helped. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amma literally cried watching the movie. Being a participant of youth festivals for years, she enjoyed every bit of the movie. She was very emotional and nostalgic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 He really loved the movie and told me that Poomaram will be the movie that will be close to my heart even after years of doing cinema. 
 
 
 
 
 
 No. I am not tensed. Everybody has a purpose in their life and it will be fulfilled. 
 
 
 
 
 
 I have signed up Alphonse Puthranâ€™s next movie. It is in Tamil. I am preparing for its shoot.
