LUCKNOW: After BJP's defeat in UP bypolls, the new found bonhomie between SP and BSP leadership has now made it to huge hoardings that came up in Lucknow on Friday morning. The hoardings made history as photographs of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have appeared together for the first time. The hoardings also feature pictures of   and Kanshi Ram, the founders of SP and BSP, respectively. 

 Some of the hoardings were put up right outside the SP headquarters on  . On the face of it, the hoardings are all about congratulating the SP candidates who won the bypolls. But political observers believe that coming a day after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav issued a statement extending his wishes on the birth anniversary of Kanshi Ram, there is much more to the hoardings than mere photographs and congratulatory messages."The hoarding has come up right outside SP headquarters which means it has the approval of the party leadership. Besides, all care has been taken to ensure that the BSP chief is given a respectable space on it with a photograph which is larger than that of Akhilesh," pointed out a political observer. 
 
 The man behind the hoardings,   says the publicity material only reflects the feelings of the party workers in SP and BSP. "Party workers at the ground level, on both the sides, are convinced that coming together of the two parties was crucial in the present political scenario to check the saffron surge," he told TOI, adding that the party workers are looking up to their respective leaders to make the next move.
