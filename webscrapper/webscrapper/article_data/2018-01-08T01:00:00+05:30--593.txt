This weekend, the reality TV show   saw fan favourite and Gurgaon boy   get evicted from the house. Luv, who entered the house as a commoner, had emerged as one of the favourites to win this season and so, his exit before the finale week came as a shock to many. Speaking to us right after his eviction, Luv said he felt he had managed to do well on the show. "Initially, I had thought, I would get evicted in the third week itself, so it's great that I managed to survive this long. This show taught me patience so I have no complaints and no regrets. Of course, when you get so close to winning the whole thing, it hurts a little," says Luv.

  
  
 
  Luv hails from Muzaffarnagar in west UP and currently stays in Gurgaon with his family. Over the months, Luv had developed a dedicated fan following in western UP, Delhi, and Haryana, much akin to last yearâ€™s winner  . His fans had been campaigning for him with hoardings and rallies with cavalcades of cars. Surprised by this, Luv says, "This is just so amazing. Last year tak I was a common man. Koi fans nahin thay mere. To hear people supporting you like this is so surreal." His exit has also caused his fans to vent on social media, calling for a boycott of Bigg Boss itself, as they feel Luv has been unfairly evicted. "I am deeply grateful to all my fans for this love and support. But yaar, gussa mat ho. It's just a show. I am happy with the way I played. Aaj nahin toh kal evict toh hona hi tha. Enjoy the show, support others and keep supporting me in my future endeavours," he appeals to his fans.
 
  For now, Bigg Boss is not on his mind. He says, "I have missed home. I have missed the traffic, the crowd, the shorgul of Delhi and Gurgaon all these months. All the things you take for granted about this city are the ones you miss when you are away. I just want to be back home and relax with my family for a while. I have never been away from home for so long so I'm looking forward to the reunion."
