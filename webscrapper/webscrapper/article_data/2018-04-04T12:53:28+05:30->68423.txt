PANAJI: While data imaging of old books in order to preserve its information may be practiced by libraries across the world, the Goa state central library is going a step ahead and preserving old books in an effort to enhance their shelf life. This is being done by way of a disinfection station which is soon going to be installed at the library.

 “We are floating a tender for the digitisation agency under the   initiated by the   under the Ministry of Culture. The digitisation station will be installed once the tendering is done,” said curator,  .
 
 In this station, he informed, a device kills the microbes infecting a book by removing oxygen from the room, but maintaining the nitrogen levels. The disinfection is, therefore, done without the use of any chemicals.
 
 TOI had reported in July 2014 that the library had begun digitising its rare documents and old books. This digitization was being done in the data imaging section which has the German-made overhead scanner.
 
 So far, two lakh pages have been scanned and saved in the library’s archive, but yet another 50 lakh pages are awaiting their shot at immortality through digitization. The library is also contemplating to purchase another high-end scanner which can scan big books measuring 18 inches and newspaper files with ease.
 
 “The sharpness and quality of scans through the machine will be as per international standards,” Fernandes said. Readers interested in accessing these books will be given a soft copy of the required pages on a CD at Rs 10 per page.
 
 Written in Portuguese, most books date to the 16th-17th centuries and contain vital data about the history and culture of Goa, besides the trade route. Newspapers, mainly in Portuguese and Marathi, are of the 20th century.
