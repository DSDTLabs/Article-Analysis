LUCKNOW: The   on Monday referred to CBI the   murder case that took place in Saadatganj locality early this month. Several protests have been organised in the city by traders’ association against police over the businessman’s murder.

 Oil mill owner Sahu was gunned down outside his house in   in Saadatganj on February 1. Sahu was pursuing a court case against Aqeel Ansari, a listed criminal from Thakurganj. In October 2013, Aqeel had allegedly shot Shravan’s son Ayush dead in Thakurganj area after a minor tiff at a liquor shop.
 
 Principal home secretary Debasish Panda confirmed the development. “Request had been forwarded to Central government to get Shravan murder case probed by CBI,” said Panda. The murder led to panic among traders and businessmen in Old City who were pressing for a CBI probe.
 
 Shravan was being threatened by Aqeel and his accomplices repeatedly before he was murdered. Police were also trying to frame Shravan in a fake criminal case at Aqeel’s behest and senior superintendent of Luckow police had to dismiss three policemen for the shameful act.
 
 The family welcomed the move. “I lost first my younger brother and then my father. Aqeel was behind the two acts. Lucknow police knew the threat our family faced but did nothing to protect us. On the contrary, they tried to frame my father,” said Suneet, businessman’s son. With arrest of five persons, the city police claimed to have worked out the case.
 
 Department of personnel and training will now decide whether to take up the case and hand it over to CBI. Since a lot of BJP leaders have assured to help the Sahu family, Suneet seemed hopeful. “I think CBI will take over the case,” he said.
