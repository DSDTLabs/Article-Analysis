SURAT: In a first-of-its-kind action, the   (ED) has booked two notorious bootleggers from the Union territory of   under the provisions of   (PMLA) and expedited the process to attach their properties. 

 ED officials had raided   alias Michael’s properties in Daman in May and started the process to attach his properties worth Rs 30 crore. Documents recovered during investigation showed that Patel had purchased the properties from the money that he earned through bootlegging activities. 
 
 Investigation against Ramesh was first started by the office of additional director general of police, Surat range in October 2016 after seizure of a truck loaded with liquor in Barbodhan village of Olpad near Surat city. The liquor consignment sent by Ramesh’s close aide Sanat Patel was to be handed over to city-based bootleggers Firoz Fruitwala and his brother Salim. The accused had used papers of a private company to bring the liquor consignment into Gujarat.
 
 Ramesh and his associates received payment for the liquor supplied to Gujarat and the money was shown as having been earned in a legal way. 
 
 “The accused deposited the money in his bank account and purchased properties. The documents proved that the money earned through crime was laundered. Hence, it was a strong case of PMLA,” said Shamsher Singh, ADGP, Surat range.
 
 Police investigation against Pramod Tandel, a wine shop owner in Daman, found that he had generated his wealth through bootlegging activities. The ED sleuths have collected strong evidence against Tandel too and started the process to attach his properties worth Rs30 crore. The ED sleuths came on the scene after Gujarat police began to trail bootleggers in Daman after a hooch tragedy had resulted in the deaths of many people in south Gujarat a few months ago.
