PUNE: Now, students appearing externally for the   (SSC) exam will also be eligible for the   conducted by the Maharashtra state board of secondary and  .

 The aptitude test was started last year and nearly 15 lakh students appeared for the same.
 
 The increasing number of students opting for higher education in the state led the government to introduce these tests along with career counselling. But in its maiden year, the test was held only for regular students. Students sitting for the SSC exam externally will also get the opportunity to appear for the aptitude test this year onwards, state board Chairman Gangadhar Mhamane said.
 
 “The test is conducted in February simultaneously with the SSC practical exams. The results will be shared in April-May,” said Mhamane.
 
 He added that over one lakh students appear for the exam externally. “We took help of NGOs to conduct the exam last year, but from now on the board will handle it,” Mhamane said.
