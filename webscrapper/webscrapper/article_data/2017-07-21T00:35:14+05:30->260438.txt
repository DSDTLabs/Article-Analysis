Ludhiana: Massive rush of trains at the end of summer vacations has resulted in disorders in rail traffic, with at least nine trains starting from New Delhi and passing through Ludhiana station running late by several hours. The worst effected rail routes were the long route ones. Station superintendent Ashok Salaria says trains were running behind schedule from their starting point, as due to the summer rush, many special trains too were running. Several times, traffic department officials had to divert the route of trains to ease the rush witnessed at different stations.

 Lohit Express — which usually arrives at 7.30am — was delayed by three hours and forty minutes, arriving at the station at 11.10am; Amritsar Express — which was scheduled to arrive at 1.30 pm — reached the station at 3pm; Jansewa Express was delayed by two hours, reaching the station at 2.15pm; while Amrapali Express arrived at 9pm, instead of 7pm.
 
 Avadh Assam Express was delayed by three-and-a-half hours, reaching at 8am; Paschim Express was delayed by 50 minutes, reaching at 5.30pm instead of 4.40pm; Ganga-Satluj Express and Saharsa Express were also running late by one-and-a-half hour, and expected to reach at around 8pm instead off 6.30pm. Many passengers were left stranded at the station. Rail commuters faced a tough time, as they had to wait for several hours in the small and congested waiting rooms meant.
 
 Rohit Sharma, who was waiting for Jansewa Express at Ludhiana station stated to TOI: “I cursed my luck, as the Jansewa Express was delayed by more than two hours. I was here at my grandmother’s place for spending my summer vacations. Passengers had to wait in the open in the scorching heat, as the non-AC waiting halls were mostly full, due to heavy rush. It was the worst experience I ever had in my whole life.”
