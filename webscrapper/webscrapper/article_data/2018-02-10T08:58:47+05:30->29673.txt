TRICHY: In an effort to remove the stigma associated to viewing public toilets, the Trichy corporation has launched a   attempt by renting out a portion of available space across potential sanitary complexes here to house   centres. 

 In a first of the pan-city drive covering all four zones, a room for ATM belonging to   (SBI) was established in a   near Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai on Friday. The facility is likely to be expanded to 16 other public toilets. The civic body has planned to net 15.3 lakhs per annum as revenue through rent collected from  , the lone bank that has opted to make use of the vacant space available in sanitary complexes. 
 
 The Urban Local Body (ULB) has about 312 public toilets, 86 sanitary complexes, and 19 pay and use toilets spread across 65 wards of the city. The idea was floated by Trichy corporation in November 2017 as an innovative revenue generation model to monetise available resources- the spaces available in sanitary complexes.
 
 As opening ATM centres was identified as a viable option to generate revenue, the corporation in association with SBI had identified 17 viable sanitary complexes across the city. Official sources with the civic body said that monthly rent averaging between 5,000 to 11,000 per outlet would be collected from the SBI for utilising the space. SBI officials informed that other ATM centres would be gradually opened in a month span. 
 
 "Apart from the revenue perspective, significance of public toilets will increase and the stigma associated with them will fade. This is first of its kind revenue generation model in the state, following New Delhi," corporation commissioner N Ravichandran told TOI.
