Besides consumer durables, the slowdown has hit demand for two-wheeler  , which reflected in vehicle sales.

 The credit bureau recently conducted an impact analysis of demonetisation on credit demand during November-December 2016. The analysis shows that only   and auto loans crept up through December 2016, after a sharp decline following the announcement of demonetisation. TransUnion Cibil is best placed to provide industry data on consumer durables, as these are largely unsecured loans and almost every loan is advanced only after obtaining a credit report from the information bureau.
 
 The credit bureau computed expected volume numbers based on how loans grew week-over-week in November and December 2016. As against the expected growth, actual application volumes were down by 60% in consumer durables, 43% in two-wheelers, 31% in industry, 27% in housing and 23% in personal consumption loans.
 
 “Prior to November 8, credit demand was growing at an average 35% on an annual basis across all loan products, with significant year-over-year growth in demand for consumer loans (up 71%) and credit cards (up 41%). This growth was seen broadly across the spectrum of lenders,” said Amrita Mitra, vice president- financial services research and consulting at TransUnion CIBIL.
 
 “Two-wheeler and consumer durable loans, usually serviced by private bank and finance companies, were the most negatively impacted—significantly in key geographies like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh & West Bengal,” said Mitra.
 
 “Interestingly, credit card applications registered growth of more than 50% over the same period last year, which can be attributed to the “go cashless” objective of the demonetisation policy,” said Mitra.
