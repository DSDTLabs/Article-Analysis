PUNE: It is not just the   (PMC) which is planning and executing   in Pune, but also the state and Centre.

 Governments at the state and Centre have emerged as major players in the city's development, and the paradigm shift is more apparent than ever with the BJP in power at the city, state and national levels.
 
 Also, considering the PMC's financial status and limited resources, a new financial model for Pune has been introduced, with the state and Centre funding, or playing a key role in major projects.
 
 “The focus is on infrastructure development now, with an aim to transform the urban landscape by introducing metro rail, BRTS and separate cycling tracks,“ saling tracks,“ said Union urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu. During his recent Pune visit, Naidu said the government has a bigger role to play in growing cities like Pune.
 
 Municipal commissioner   said that the city is set to witness a boost in infrastructural development, the time has come to launch big projects which have been pen ding for years. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader  , however, said that the state and Centre were interfering with the autonomy of civic body. “Right from approval of the development plan to allocation of funds and deciding projects and polices, the government is playing a major role,“ he said.
 
 BJP leaders refuted this, claiming Pune needs a major infrastructure boost to attract investment, and improve the citizens' quality of life. To execute the development plan in the old city area, the civic body faces the task of raising Rs25,000 crore, a sum which will improve infrastructure and meet its social obligations in the years to come.
 
 “The civic body cannot work in isolation. The state, Centre and the PMC have started working in tandem and results will be visible soon,“ said BJP city unit president Yogesh Gogawale.
