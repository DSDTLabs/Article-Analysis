UDAIPUR: Rajasthan   chief   urged the party workers to play a significant role in conveying the party ideology and its programmes to the common man ahead of the assembly elections.   said the BJP has made life miserable for the common man by increasing water and electricity tariff. 

 “Youths are knocking doors to find a job, crime against women and girls have increase many folds, the BJP is creating divide between castes and sections of society and a negative environment that had never been seen in 70 years, is prevailing now in their rule,” said Pilot, addressing a large audience at the RCA ground on Thursday at the 'Mera Booth, Mera Gaurav' programme. 
 
 The   chief said, “The BJP calls itself the largest political party, however, they haven’t been able to find a unit chief so far. People from every walk of life, middle and poor class are tired of their false promises, and now people no longer trust their words.” 
 
 Urging the booth workers, Pilot said that the grassroots workers have to play an important role in taking forward the Congress party's principles and agendas before the public so that they can decide who are more deserving to come to power in the next election. Pilot also said that at a time when distrust, discrimination, intolerance, and misery prevails in the country only Congress has the power to bind people together in unity and restore peace and integrity.
 
 AICC general secretary   in his speech said, “The results of bi-elections almost everywhere has exposed the public sentiments and BJP's position could be estimated by these results. The party has rapidly lost its base and trust among the common, especially farmers and the down trodden class.” Former union ministers Dr. CP Joshi, Dr. Girija Vyas, Namo Narayan Meena, leader of the opposition Rameshwar Dudi and many other dignitaries addressed the gathering.
