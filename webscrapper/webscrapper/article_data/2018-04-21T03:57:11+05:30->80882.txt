MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday asked the state government if it had details of the exact number of illegal buildings in Mumbai. A division bench of Justice   and Justice   posed the question while hearing petitions challenging the government’s decision to make changes to Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act to allow for regularisation of pre-2015 illegal buildings.

 “Do you have the number of illegal buildings in Mumbai. Have you considered the effect of large-scale regularisation of unauthorised structures on town planning and civic amenities?” asked the judges.
 
 Senior advocate   told the court that not all illegal buildings would be regularised. “Only those structures that can be regularised under provisions of law will be allowed to be legalised,” said advocate Sakhare.
 
 Last year, the government had refused to give its nod for an ambitious amnesty plan for pre-2015 illegal buildings in the state. As per the state’s estimates there are over 10 lakh such buildings that would have benefit from the largesse.
 
 “Regularisation of a large number of buildings, which is contrary to development control regulations, will completely destroy town planning...” the court had then observed. It also said that the government’s proposed policy had carved out a way for even buildings on government land to be regularised if they got an   from the public authority. The court has scheduled further hearing of the case on May 4.
