NAGPUR: Three actors on stage dressed in  , red light focusing on their faces. They stun you with rapidly changing reactions to issues such as corporatization, religion, urbanization, war, and destruction. But as they move from one issue to another, they state, ‘Baaki sarva theek aahe’ (everything is going on well). Director Dhananjay Mandavkar’s absurd play by the same name was staged at   on Friday evening.

 The Marathi one-act   amateur actors from Umred — Aditya Bulkunde, Kirti Malode and Sameer Shinde — whose portrayal of emotions draws you into the act and keeps you hooked till the end. 
 
 The play is based on city poet Loknath Yashwant’s  , ‘Baaki sarva theek aahe,’ released last year in July. It has 55 poems. Music was given by Akshay Kose and lights were managed by Ashish Urkude.
 
 “I pick stories or poems which influence me positively,” said Mandavkar. “All of us experience pain on the inside but whenever someone asks, we say ‘everything is okay’,” he added. It took him two years to direct the production.
 
 Expressing his thoughts about the act, Yashwant said he thought of the story first and the lines of poetry later. 
 
 The show was staged as part of First Bell On Stage, an initiative by Rashtrabhasha Parivar, to encourage new artistes and give them the platform they deserve.
