  It is quite common for theatres to increase ticket prices for blockbuster films, especially on weekends. The inflated prices also contribute to films joining the Rs100 crore-plus club. Karnataka capping movie ticket prices at `200 has exhibitors across the country worried, wondering if the rule will be implemented in other states as well. While one Delhi exhibitor says that if such a rule is implemented everywhere, it will be the end of films minting `300 crore in the opening weekend, à la Baahubali, another exhibitor says that after paying 40% entertainment tax, if they also have to adhere to a price cap, they will have to shut shop.
