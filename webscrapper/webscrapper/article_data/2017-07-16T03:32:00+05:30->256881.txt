Panaji: The state commissioner for disabilities, together with the directorate of panchayats, has begun undertaking a survey to bridge the gap between persons with disabilities in the state and those who have disability certificates.  “According to the 2011 census, there are 33,012 persons with disabilities in the state, but only around 18,000 have disability certificates,” said state commissioner for disabilities Anuradha Joshi, adding that it is important to update figures and reach out to more people. The directorate of panchayats has been providing the necessary support to get the survey done through block level officers and panchayat members. “Once we have the right base data to work with, planning and implementation of government policies and schemes for persons with disabilities will become easier. It will also help in correcting budget allocation,” Joshi said.  Taluka-wise meetings organised by the commission’s office, together with Saksham, and NGO working with the visually-impaired, will begin this month to create awareness about the importance of the survey. Each panch member will have to fill up simple forms with details like name of the person, address, aadhar card number, whether they have a disability certificate or not, type of disability, and contact number. This data, once collated, will present a clearer picture of the number of persons with disabilities in Goa and will prove useful with the recent Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
