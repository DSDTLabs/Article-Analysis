MEERUT: A day after a 30-year old man’s body was found near a village in Saharanpur, police on Saturday revealed that the man had been killed by his brother because of his   which was not acceptable to the family.
 
 According to SP (rural)  , “The deceased, Ajeet Singh, was a resident of Behada village in Saharanpur and was having a discord with his elder brother  , 33, who had repeatedly tried to persuade him to keep away from the company of local eunuchs. But Ajeet wouldn’t listen. Eventually, on Friday night, while Ajeet was fast asleep, Amit hit him with a spade on his head and killed him. Later, he threw the body near the jungle of another village.”
  
 After his arrest, Amit said, “The entire family was being mocked by neighbours as Ajit used to behave abnormally. There were instances when he would upload his own pictures wearing a sari or dancing with the eunuchs. There was no option left for me but to get rid of him because of family honour.”
  
 Police sources said after the murder, Amit took the help of his cousin   and they both carried the body on a bike for disposing it. In order to avoid suspicion, Amit himself filed an FIR against an unknown killer under IPC section 302 (murder), they added.
