Ahmedabad: The managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Hyundai Motors India Limited (HMIL), Y K Koo, on Monday inaugurated a regional training centre in Ahmedabad. The training centre has been set up in line with the objectives of skill development programme of the Union government, to ensure the overall technical and soft skill development for the company’s dealerships. This is HMIL’s second regional training centre in the western region, the first one being in Mumbai and the seventh in India, with the others being in Delhi/ NCR, Kolkata, Chennai, Chandigarh and Hyderabad.

 Sharing his views on the new centre, Koo, said, “The primary focus of inaugurating this facility is improving customer satisfaction, as Gujarat is an important market for us where we have nearly 25% market share which is higher than what we have in India at 17.3%. The training will empower technicians on soft skills as well as technical expertise. We aim to train over 20,000 service manpower at all our training centres.”
 
 HMIL has also partnered with some 45 industrial training institutes (ITIs) across the country with a minimum of one ITI per state. That apart, it has also affiliated with some seven polytechnic institutes across the country. “The students from these institutes will not only be imparted training but will also be absorbed at various dealerships. In fact, 99% of trained graduates from the skill development program were recruited by the company’s dealerships last year.”
