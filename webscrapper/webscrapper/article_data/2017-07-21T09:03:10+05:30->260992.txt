PUNE: Five companies have expressed interest in designing and constructing an elevated viaduct for the metro rail stretch from Vanaz to civil court in Shivajinagar. This particular stretch is 7.15km long, and is part of the   route planned by the  .

 Bids were invited by the corporation for which the deadline was on Tuesday. Maha-Metro aims to complete the allotment of tenders after scrutinizing every proposal on technical parameters over the next few weeks. Brijesh Dixit, Maha-Metro managing director, said the scrutiny will be completed within a month, following which the field work will begin.
 
 The formalities are expected to be over within a month's time, but the corporation expects the ball to roll well before then. Dixit said they well try to prevent undue delays.
 
 The stretch in question is a part of the east-west corridor of the metro project. The entire stretch is elevated, and is the second stretch the corporation is working on. Maha-Metro has already started work on the first corridor between Pimpri and Range Hills, at Nashik phata a few months ago.
 
 The initial tender process for the Vanaz-civil court stretch had run into technical trouble and so, Maha-Metro had reinvited bids. As per sources, the five companies that had expressed interest are domestic entities.
 
 There are eight stations planned on the stretch, excluding civil court. The route was planned via Anandnagar, Ideal colony, Nal Stop, Deccan Gymkhana and Pune Municipal Corporation. After the civil court station, the metro route will proceed via Pune station up to Ramwadi.
 
 The civil court will be an interchange point for the two metro routes. Meanwhile, Maha-Metro has also called for tenders for the construction of eight elevated metro stations on the route, and for the designing of all 12 stations on the Vanaz-Ramwadi route.
