KOLKATA: A teacher from Rabindra Pally Primary School,  , filed a petition in high court on Friday, seeking an upgrade of the pay packet for primary   in the state. She pointed out the pay mismatch between teachers working in state-aided primary schools and in those run by the Centre. The pay band for in-service primary teachers in Bengal (Rs 5,400-25,200) is way behind the central pay band (Rs 9,300-34,000).

 An education department official, however, said: “Many teachers in state primary schools are Madhyamik passouts with one-year teacher training diploma, but NCTE requires teachers to get at least 50% in HS and complete a two-year teaching diploma course.” But   teacher   said, “Of the 3.5 lakh primary teachers, those appointed after 2005 fulfil the NCTE criteria. And the rule doesn’t apply those whose results were published before June 2001.
