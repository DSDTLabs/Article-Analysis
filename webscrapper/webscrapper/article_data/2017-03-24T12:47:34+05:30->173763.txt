 “We had also annexed newspaper reports in which it has been stated that a gang of hooligans has been exposed which was involved in the crimes like harassment, rape, loot and other illegal activities at Kajligarh. It was also alleged in that news that the said gang has committed rape with 45 girls in last two years at the tourist places,” petitioner’s counsel Manish Yadav said.
 
 However, the court dismissed the newspaper reports stating that there was nothing to support the published news. 
 
 The state government had also stated that only one incident of loot was reported in the area and that the police took immediate action after completing the investigation and had filed the final report before the lower court. 
 
 The court said that the petition was bereft of merit and was liable to be dismissed.
