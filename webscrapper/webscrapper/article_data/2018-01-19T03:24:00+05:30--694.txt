Nagpur: Record a GIB sighting and get Rs 500! The state’s principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) AK Misra has started a novel scheme to save the critically endangered birds in Maharashtra. The foresters seem to have pressed panic buttons after not a single GIB was sighted in the five-day landscape level survey launched from September 25 to 30 in the state in 53,000 sqkm area with the help of 31 teams. The joint survey was conducted by forest department and Wildlife Institute of India (WII). A decade ago, at least 35-40 GIBs were recorded in 10 sqkm area in Nananj during annual survey. Misra said sighting of not a single bird doesn’t mean that there are no GIBs in the state. “It was a landscape survey conducted to know probable GIB habitats. We also scouted for associated species like black buck, chinkara and nilgais,” he added. “Initially, the reward scheme will be worked out in Nanaj (Solapur) and its landscape where most of the GIB population is concentrated. After its success, we plan to replicate it in Warora in Chandrapur where GIBs are recorded,” said Misra. The directions came at a meeting with wildlife officials chaired by Misra on Wednesday to approve management plans of at least 7-8 wildlife sanctuaries — Nanaj, Tungareshwar, Tamhni, Sagareshwar, Aner Dam, Gautala Autram Ghat, Nandur Madheshwar and Deulgaon-Rehekuri in Western Maharashtra. The officials have also been told to put inputs in the management plan of the bustard sanctuary and it should also be working plan prescription for areas outside the sanctuary.  “The scheme will be applicable in 366sqkm Nanaj and its landscape spread in three districts and 191 villages. The farmers or any individual can show geotagged pictures of GIB sightings and receive the reward,” said Misra. APCCF for wildlife, west, MK Rao said farmers need to be rewarded. Veteran GIB expert Gopal Thosar hailed PCCF’s decision to reward farmers.
