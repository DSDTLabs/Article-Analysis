CHANDIGARH: To overcome the shortage of doctors, the Punjab council of ministers on Monday took a decision to pay full salary, including all allowances, to   doctors during their probation period too. 

 The cabinet, headed by chief minister  , has taken a decision to do away with the condition of 'basic pay only' for newly-appointed medical officers in the health and family welfare department. The decision has been taken keeping in view the practice being already followed in several other categories, including   (judicial), assistant teachers/scientists of   ( ) and specialist doctors.
 
 As per a notification issued by the finance department on January 15, 2015, all newly appointed employees and officers of Punjab government, including MBBS doctors, were being given only basic salary during their probation period. This had proved to be a deterrent in getting MBBS doctors to join or remain in government hospitals. Monday's decision would facilitate new MBBS doctors to get full salary in the pay scale of Rs 15,600-39,100 plus Rs 5,400 as grade pay. 
 
 The cabinet also approved the 'Punjab Health and Family Welfare, Technical (Group B) Service Rules-2018' to facilitate recruitment and promotions on various vacant posts. These rules would also open more channels of promotion for the paramedical and technical staff of the health and family welfare department.
