PANAJI: Congress appears to have made up its mind on around 15 candidates, including sitting MLAs, but appears to be losing sleep over some constituencies where chances of in-fighting and rebellion are high. 

 Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president   and opposition leader Pratapsingh Rane will on Tuesday meet with the Congress screening committee and the   to take a final call on candidates.
 
  The uncertainty over an alliance also seems to be keeping Congress and its workers on tenterhooks. While tacit support to MLA Atanasio Monserrate appears all but sure, GPCC seems perturbed over the prospect of joining hands with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).
 
 Joining hands with NCP may require Congress to make way for NCP’s Churchill Alemao who is expected to contest from Benaulim. In the event that Alemao is accommodated in Benaulim, the former PWD minister is expected to support Faleiro in Navelim. 
 
 This puts Congress’ Benaulim aspirant and block president Edwin Barreto in a spot. “In Benaulim, Edwin’s name is nearly final. The picture will only be clear after the CEC meets and a decision is taken on an alliance,” a party worker said.
 
 Another constituency where the party is facing a dilemma is Calangute with former Calangute MLA Agnel Fernandes keen on contesting from the seat.
 
 Congress for a while did float with the idea of getting Fernandes to contest against tourism minister Dilip Parulekar in Saligao, an idea that Fernandes is not too enthusiastic about.
 
 Recently, Congress appears to be getting used to the idea of former chief minister Wilfred D’Souza’s son-in-law Tulio D’Souza being the face of the party in Saligao, and the party has all but narrowed down on Mariano Rodrigues to take on MLA Alina Saldanha in Cortalim.
 
 Former Congress leaders like Joaquim Alemao, Aleixo Sequeira and   also lobbying for tickets with the central leadership.
