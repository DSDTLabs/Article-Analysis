AHMEDABAD: The state government doled out  , ranging from 63% to 124%, to its fixed-pay employees on Wednesday. However, it refrained from making a commitment on paying the  .

 Deputy chief minister   said: “The decision of pay hike does not include any commitment on giving arrears to the fixed-pay employees.” 
 
 It needs mention that the Gujarat high court in 2012 termed the employment of   illegal and asked the state government to pay the employees in full, similar to the payscale of regular employees along with arrears for pay since they began working. 
 
 The state challenged the order in the Supreme Court and the matter is pending there. Meanwhile, the government accepted the demand for HRA, transfer allowance and medical allowance at par with other employees. 
 
 “This, however, will be part of the new salary structure,” the DyCM said.
 
 Patel however clarified that the benefits, including the pay hike announced by the government, was only for fixed-pay workers who were selected through the recruitment process conducted by the GPSC and other agencies. “It will not be effective for contract workers,” Patel said.
 
 There will be no immediate benefits for grant-in-aid, board or corporation employees. 
 
 “The government’s decision will apply for direct government controlled authorities. All grant-in-aid schools, colleges and other bodies will have to adopt it on their own. Government boards, corporation and companies will also have to do make separate financial provisions if they want to follow the government,” Patel said.
