It was an event that was about a lot of fun, about artistic expressions and also a party. People from all over Mumbai got together and not just worked on canvases but also mingled with each other and for once were away from digital media. 

  Ubaid, a self-taught artist taught non-professional, first-time painters, the art of holding a brush and creating something new on canvas. People of all ages were a part of this unique   and Reshma was deft with her instructions with them. 
 
 
  
 
 Talking about it she said, “Painting is all about passion. If you respond to the passion that you have inside yourself, that’s when the real painting comes out. Selling your work is a bonus; painting itself is what really matters. After that it’s just a little something of you, call it soul, that has to go into the painting, and I think that comes with hard work, age and experience. It’s all those experiences, good and bad, that are translated into what you paint. While making art, I temporarily move away from my own reality into a larger perspective, where I experience a moment of peace and that peace is nirvana for me.”
 
 
  
 It was a step-by-step instructional three hour painting workshop for adults, with no painting experience required and they also got to carry the painting home. “My favourite part is seeing the happy faces after the painting workshop is over,” says Reshma.
