 KSPB member Mridul Eapen said, "The government has revived the gender budgeting manual released last year and it is expected to address women healthcare, child care, maternity benefits and other women specific issues. Taking a step further, the unpaid household work of women is expected to be recognised, by ensuring proper benefits," she said. In the 9th five year plan, women component plan (WCP) was introduced, ear marking10% of local body funds for women specific schemes. In the 12th five year plan, a gender responsive budget was declared with two parts - Part A for total women specific schemes and Part B in which 30% of allocation from various departments for schemes that would benefit women.
 
 "Though the macroeconomic policy is gender blind, specific allocation based on gender budgeting will help women.

But, it should reach the deserving and that can happen only through timely allocation of funds," said another member of KSPB.
 
 Gender budgeting aims at making the government and society aware of women's role in household work and care and the need to ensure that the deprived sections such as unwed mothers, tribal women issues are addressed through maternity benefits, community kitchen and other schemes.
 
 The women specific schemes also include more funding for programmes such as the 'back to lab' scheme for women in science who can continue their scientific pursuit even after taking a break in their career due to child birth.
