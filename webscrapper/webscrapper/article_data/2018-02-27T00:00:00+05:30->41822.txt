Filmmaker  , who was in Lucknow recently, has gotten addicted to   paan. Anubhav, who shot for his movie   in November, went to have paan near the   office in   while he was shooting in the city. The Tum Bin director, who was in the city on a personal visit, again happened to visit the same paanwala. To Sinhaâ€™s surprise, the paanwala remembered what type of paan he ate and served him a paan that was exact to his taste. Expressing his delight, Sinha said, "This paanwala served me paan in November after the wrap of my movie Mulk, which I shot here. So when I walked into his shop in the night a couple of days ago, he remembered the kind of paan I had last time and made exactly the same taste-wala paan. This is Lucknow!" said Anubhav.
