MUMBAI: As the stand-off between school managements and parents continue over fee hikes, a Pune-based think tank, System Correcting Movement (SYSCOM), has demanded that it be made mandatory for schools to disclose expenditures to justify fee hikes. In a report to the state,   has said schools should not charge more than 13% of the previous year's expenses.

 SYSCOM has recommended to the government streamlining of the fee fixation process to ensure that schools run by not-for-profit trusts do not overcharge. SYSCOM has suggested that schools reveal their expenses on their websites, admission brochures or notifications sent to students.“We don't mind paying the fees but there must be proof that the money is being spent for the child's education. At present, schools demand high fees but have no answers when questioned about infrastructure,“ said   from Mahaparents, a group of parents.
 
 The report suggests that schools' balancesheets could be verified by committees at the school, district or state level by professionals such as CAs, education experts, district court judges and architects. “If a school is found to be cheating, they must be made to refund fees and pay a fine. In case of several complaints against a single school, the fine must be higher and the institute must be derecognized,“ said   of SYSCOM.
 
 The think-tank has devised a format which will help parents calculate the expenditure made by a school for every child. “Considering depreciation and inflation, the school can be allowed to hike fees by about 13% every year on the actual expenses it makes. The fee structure currently is inflated,“ added Bafna.
