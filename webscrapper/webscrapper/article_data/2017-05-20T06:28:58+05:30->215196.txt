HYDERABAD: In an attempt to encourage  , educational institutions in Telangana are fast taking to digitisation. 

 In the latest move, more than 1,100 institutes have tied up with paytm to help candidates use app-based wallets to make payments. This list includes the   Technological University-Hyderabad, Aakash Institute and Next Education, among others.
 
 "Post demonetisation, many people faced a lot of difficulty in making payments. To cut down on their trouble and simplify the payment procedure, we decided to integrate it with a mobile wallet company. This will ensure seamless fee submission for all our students. Also parents will no longer need to queue up in front of banks for paper-based transactions. The idea is to simplify all other procedures so that the entire focus can be the students' educational development," said  , director, Aakash Educational Services.
 
 Students agreed that payments through mobile wallets are more hassle-free and convenient, particularly when it comes to paying fees.
 
 "The introduction of a mobile wallet at our institute has made the payment process smooth and relatively more simple. There is no need to add beneficiaries or enhance transfer limits. All one needs is a mobile and internet connection," said  , a third-year B Tech student.
 
 Parents also welcomed the move and said that educational institutions which failed to upgrade themselves earlier are now forced to do so after demonetisation.
 
 "Time and again I have asked the authorities of the school where my son studies to accept card or wallet payment. But every time they refused to change over from the traditional practice and insisted that I paid either through cash or cheque. However, recently they started accepting card payments. It has brought much respite to parents like me," said M Raghuram, whose children study in the Class 2 and 5 at a CBSE-certified school in the city.
