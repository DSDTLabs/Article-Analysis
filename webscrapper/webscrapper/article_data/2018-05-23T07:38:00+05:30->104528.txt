Ludhiana: As hot and humid weather conditions continue to prevail in the city on Tuesday, the day temperature touched 42 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest day of May. The city Met department has predicted that the temperature in the coming days might further increase, with chances of heavy dust storms in the evening hours.

 The maximum temperature on Tuesday at 42C was two degrees above normal, while the minimum temperature at 23.6C was a degree less than normal. The relative humidity in the city was around 84%, which is slightly above normal.
 
 Weather experts said: “Dry weather conditions are likely to prevail in the city in the next few days, along with chances of heavy dust storm in the evening hours. Isolated heat wave conditions would prevail in the next two days, and there is possibility that the day temperature until the end of May will remain above 40 degrees Celsius. Still, there are no chances of partly cloudy weather along with moderate to heavy rainfall in the city. Residents should take all appropriate measures to counter the hot weather conditions, as the city temperature might increase in the next few days.”
 
 Meanwhile, city residents are waiting for rainfall so that they can get some respite from the hot and humid weather conditions, which forces them to remain inside their houses in the hot afternoon hours. One city businessman, Rajesh Sharma, said: “With every passing day, the day temperature in the city is increasing, creating problems for the common man who has to move outdoors for his work. As Ludhiana is highly polluted, the weather seems warmer here as compared to other cities where there is enough greenery.”
