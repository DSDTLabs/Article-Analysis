RAE BARELI: BJP national president   on Saturday chose Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of   chairperson  , to criticise   by accusing it of “stooping to the lowest possible level to target its political opponents”.

 
 Shah’s attack on Congress came after the SC dismissed the PIL seeking a   probe into the death of CBI special court judge, Justice BH Loya, and the acquittal of the accused in the   blast case. “Congress needs to apologise for its deeds. It needs to decide as to what level it will stoop to target its political opponents,” Shah told a rally in Rae Bareli’s GIC ground, where rebel Congress MLC in the UP Vidhan Parishad Dinesh Pratap Singh joined BJP along with his three siblings.
 
 Hitting out at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Shah said: “There is a rule of law... there are courts, there is a Constitution. No one can hide the truth. Rahul, too, cannot hide the truth.”
 
 While Shah did not make a direct reference to the SC verdict, UP CM   and BJP state chief Mahendra Nath Pandey demanded that Congress apologise for maligning the image of the BJP chief in Justice Loya case. “Congress conspiracy stands exposed,” said Pandey.
 
 Shah slammed Congress for calling the blast in Hyderabad’s Mecca Masjid in 2007 as a case of “Bhagwa Atankwad” (saffron terrorism). “Congress should apologise for all the canards it spread to malign the image of political adversaries,” said Shah, days after an NIA court acquitted Swami Aseemanand in the blast case.
 
 He added that Rae Bareli was a classic case of a constituency which always witnessed ‘parivarwad’ and not ‘vikaswaad’.
