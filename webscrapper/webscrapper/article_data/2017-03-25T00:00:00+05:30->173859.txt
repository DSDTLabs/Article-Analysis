After showcasing a power-packed performance as a 28-year-old research student who falls in love with a younger guy in  , actress Shruti Menon is all set to make a mark in her next, directed by Pradeep Chokli. The film, titled Chippy, has her playing the role of a slum dweller.

 Her character, Shruti says, resides in a slum and sells kaaya varuthathu (banana chips) in the market for a living. “Though men keep constantly ogling at her, it only makes her bold and aggressive. However, she is essentially soft-hearted which gets revealed when she is with kids.”
 
 Director Pradeep adds that Chippy is a children’s film, and mainly revolves around a school situated on the seashore. “Under certain circumstances in the school, four Upper Primary students make a short film highlighting their concerns. The subject they take up is something that affects everyone around. However, they come across certain stumbling blocks in the process.”
 
 Later, the students approach Shruti for help. Pradeep adds, “Shruti is a constant source of support for them. She is asked to play the mother of the central character and she agrees.” Shruthi divulges that it was the story that prompted her to take up the project. “It is a heartwarming story, and there is a lot of transformation in my character,” she adds.
 Salim Kumar, Manikandan, Joy Mathew and Surabhi play prominent roles in the film. Chippy, which was mostly shot in Thalassery is expected to release on May 2.
