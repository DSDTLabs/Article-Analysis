HYDERABAD: Actress Mumait Khan, who took a break from the   house to appear before the prohibition and excise sleuths, on Thursday told Special Investigation Team (SIT) that she `hardly' parties at pubs. She, however, admitted that she smokes and consumes alcohol, but denied doing drugs. She volunteered to give her blood, hair and nail samples, but SIT sleuths said, if need be, they will collect them later.

 During the over six-hour questioning, the SIT sleuths quizzed her on pub visits and parties. The actress claimed she rarely visits and parties at pubs. “Like Charmme, Mumait too denied knowing any drug peddlers. She also denied every abusing drugs,“ a source in the excise department said.
 
 Mumait claimed she mostly stays in Mumbai and visits Hyderabad only when she has a scheduled shoot here. As not many   projects were in hand, she claimed her visits to Hyderabad had come down drastically, the official said.
 
 When asked about her equation with director   and Tollywood personalities under the scanner in the drugs case, Mumait clarified that she only had a professional relationship with them.
 
 Earlier, the actress landed at the SIT office around 9.45 am. However, unlike the situation the previous day , the excise sleuths ensured there were enough women policemen at  .
 
 When the SIT sleuths asked about her willingness to giving blood, nail and hair samples, Mumait agreed. Interestingly, the SIT officials did not take the samples. She was informed that, if need be, they would take the samples later. Mumait was let off before the 5pm deadline.
