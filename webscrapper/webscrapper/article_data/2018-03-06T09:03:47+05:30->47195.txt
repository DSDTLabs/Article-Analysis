NAGPUR: In what points to possible load-shedding in summer,   has revealed it was facing a 43.53% shortfall in   stock required for its thermal power stations. In an affidavit before the high court here on Monday, the power utility said it had received 95,773 tonnes of coal till now against the requirement of 119,000 tonnes, a net shortage in supply 19% per day on an average. With onset of summer, the power demand would grow and coal shortage would play a spoilsport.

 HC was hearing a PIL by activist   through counsel   contending that due to ongoing tussle between   and Mahagenco, all consumers were unnecessarily being forced to shell out more for power supply. He claimed steep hike in the generation cost was due to short supply of domestic coal and import of costly coal by the power utilities. Last week HC had directed the WCL, CIL, Mahagenco and railways to hold a joint meeting expressly for this purpose.
 
 Mahagenco’s affidavit stated power plants needed to maintain at least 22 days’ coal stocks to be ready for any exigencies. It added the railways had been instructed to ensure regular supply of rakes from MCL to power plants and the latter had agreed to supply 8-9 rakes per day to Bhusawal and Nashik.
 
 Earlier, the Central Electricity Authority had asked WCL to ensure there was no shortage of coal to the power plants in the state and stocks should be above the critically low level. Mahagenco also stated the distance between the coal pits and the power plants determined the number of days for which a power plant needed to maintain its coal inventory.
