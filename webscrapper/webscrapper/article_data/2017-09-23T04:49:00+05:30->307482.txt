Panaji: Hinting that creation of a new   and development authority ( ) was on the cards, town and country planning ( ) minister Vijai Sardesai said he would meet chief minister Manohar Parrikar soon to discuss the emergence of new satellite townships that may require dedicated PDAs. He said certain regions in Goa had assumed urban characteristics and that he was keen to create new and dedicated planning authorities for these areas in order to have planned and regulated development.

 “My discussion with the CM will include the emergence of new areas, which have now assumed proportions of satellite townships. We have to understand that certain village panchayat areas are today more urbanized than urban areas and, hence, the need to expand the network of planned areas,” Sardesai said, adding that he would also discuss outline development plans (ODP) for these areas.
 
 The GFP president said that while the Margao ODP had been scrapped and directions issued to prepare a new one, in other areas there were some issues.
 
 “There are issues pending in courts. I think there should be uniformity in action. And we have to adhere to regulations. You can’t do things that are beyond the regulations,” Sardesai said, adding that he would stand by his commitment given in the assembly that procedures regarding ODPs would be followed and implemented. 
 
 Sources said that there may be changes to the Taleigao ODP. 
 
 While Sardesai did not specify if a new coastal PDA was on the cards, there have been suggestions within political and government circles for one such body to regulate of coastal development.
