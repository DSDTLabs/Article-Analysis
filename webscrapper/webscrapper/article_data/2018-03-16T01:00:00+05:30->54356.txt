PATNA: The block development officers (BDOs) called off their indefinite strike on Thursday after rural development department minister Shrawan Kumar assured them of stern action against   block ‘pramukh’ Subuk Tara and others for allegedly assaulting Barharia BDO Rajeev Kumar Sinha on March 12. 

 All the 534 BDOs had gone on indefinite strike earlier on Thursday, paralysing works at all the blocks.
 
 Barharia police station SHO Mukesh Kumar said Tara had called Sinha for a meeting at her Barharia office in Siwan district, where several other block pramukhs, including their association’s president Kamod Narayan Singh and her supporters were also present. “The BDO received head injuries after someone hit him with a chair. Medical report confirmed head injury and bruises on other parts of his body,” Kumar said.
 
 He said Tara had also lodged an FIR and accused the BDO of slapping her in the meeting. The SHO said Sinha, in his FIR, accused Tara, her husband Ainullah Saifi, her brother-in-law Amurallah Saifi and nephew Laddan Saifi besides Mohammad Imtiaz, Israil Ansari and Ali Ahmed Khan of attacking and injuring him. He said Amurallah is the JD (U)’s state minority cell functionary.
 
 “Laddan and Ali were arrested the same day, while all others are absconding,” the SHO said, adding all the named accused were present at Tara’s office during the meeting in which the BDO was attacked. “The BDO was referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital for treatment,” he added.
 
 Talking to TOI, one of the BDOs said police were hesitant in taking coercive action against the accused due to their political patronage.
