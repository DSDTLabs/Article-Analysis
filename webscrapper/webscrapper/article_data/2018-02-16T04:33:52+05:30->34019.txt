MUMBAI: Interviews of teachers across state universities and its affiliated colleges may soon be video-recorded and will be preserved for 90 days. Uniform leave policy, including leaves for paternity and sabbatical, is likely to be made mandatory for all teachers. Universities will have a say in the appointment of teachers in autonomous and minority colleges too. These are some of the draft rules that have been introduced or made uniform for universities and colleges across the state.

 The 162-page draft copy was circulated on social media platforms for teachers’ reaction. It will be finalised only after dialogue with all the stakeholders.
 
 Former vice-chancellor of North Maharashtra  , R S Mali, who is also on the committee to formulate uniform statutes under the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, said they have made changes in the appointment process taking into account the new UGC regulations too. “While autonomous and minority colleges will have complete independence in forming their own selection committee, it has to be approved by the university...to bring about transparency in the process,” said Mali. He added that the interviews will be video-recorded and preserved to avoid allegations of lack of transparency in the process. Teachers will also be asked to give a 10-minute presentation during the interview and marks have been allotted for the same.
 
 While some universities gave casual leaves for eight days, others gave 15. The state plans to make it uniform at 12 days. Also, a 15-day paternity leave would become mandatory. Since there is no BEd-type training for university and college teachers, the draft rules recommend a three- to six-month training for entry-level teachers. 
 
 Chairman of the principal of Association of Non-Government Colleges, TA Shiware, said the rules need to be in agreement with the UGC regulations.
