Singer   regrets turning down a part in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. 

 The 38-year-old 'I'm Like a Bird' singer regrets snubbing a part as one of the sisters in the 2002 comedy - starring   and John Corbett - but says she finds acting very difficult.
 
  
  
 "I was supposed to be in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. That was a fail. I was supposed to be one of the sisters or something. Im Portuguese and I can pass as Greek." "I must have been really busy or something. I don't know what happened! You never know what's what. I don't think I ever read the script," she says.
