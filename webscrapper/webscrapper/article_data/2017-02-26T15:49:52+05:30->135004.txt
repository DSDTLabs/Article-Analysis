What is a film event without a controversy? Sandalwood directors are the first to be upset about the city's film festival even before it commences. The Karnataka Film Directors' Association (KANFIDA) has threatened to boycott the 9th Bengaluru International Film Festival ( ) that starts on February 2. In a letter to the chief minister, the association has said that it has been sidelined by the government on several film related issues in the recent past and listed out several demands if  's is to participate in the festival.

 KANFIDA has given the example of three recent developments --the Film Policy Committee, Film Festival Committee and the Puttanna Kanagal Award committee. It has said the directors association has been sidelined in all three.
 
 The directors have pointed out that Kannada film directors are given a biased treatment compared to the directors invited from outside for the festival. The inauguration and valedictory functions, in front of   and the Mysore Palace respectively, have also come in the radar of criticism. KANFIDA, in the letter, has said that extravagant ceremonies does not make the festival successful.The letter also makes note of the fact that the subsidies for the Kannada films for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 are yet to be handed out. It says that raking up the issue of subsidy during the BIFFES has a valid point because the festival's main idea is to help the Kannada film industry develop. 'What is the need for a film festival when the existing issues are not addressed,' it says.
