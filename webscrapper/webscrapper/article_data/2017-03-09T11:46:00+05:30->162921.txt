BENGALURU: To see a stranger holding a knife in your room and asking you for a sexual favour is nothing short of a nightmare. A woman from Mumbai experienced it in the wee hours of March 5.

 “I slept off while using the phone. When I woke up around 1.30am, I saw a a man standing in front of me with a knife. He asked me to hand over all the money I had. He threatened me with the knife and demanded that I have sex with him,” said the inmate of a   accommodation near Kundalahalli Gate as she recalled the horror. 
 
 When the woman asked the inturder who he was, he said he had come with a gang of five, who were having sex in other rooms. He asked her for money, saying his boss was in the next room and was demanding money from her. The woman began to search for her phone and asked the intruder where it was. She was told it was with his boss.
 
 “He asked my name, hometown and the company I work for. I gave him the wrong details. Then the man tried to pull off my blanket. I resisted and he attacked me with the knife, injuring me. He tried to touch me inappropriately,” the woman wrote in her complaint to the police commissioner.
 
 When the woman resisted his advances, he reiterated: “Why are you scared, you are like my sister!”
 
 
 
 
 The horror continued with the man asking her questions like if she was sexually active, while going through other valuables in the room. While he turned towards the door to check if anyone was coming, she ran into the bathroom and quickly locked herself in. He banged on the door several times asking her to come out. It was only when her roommate came in that the nightmare ended, as the man had fled by then. 
 
 
 
 
 The woman in her complaint said the PG accommodation owner asked her not to lodge a police complaint and even tried to compensate her monetarily for the phone she had been robbed of. He allegedly refused to hand over the CCTV footage, which showed the intruder walking into the PG.
