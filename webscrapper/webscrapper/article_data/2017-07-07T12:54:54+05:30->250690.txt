CHANDIGARH: Panjab University needs to fill 50 vacant teaching posts. Varsity officials informed the MHRD about the posts lying vacant after re-employed teachers completed their tenure, attaining the age of 65 years since 2014 till date. They have now demanded filling of vacant posts to maintain the teacher to student ratio in the University. Out of the 50 posts, two are for professors, 13 for associate professors and 35 for assistant professors.

 Since MHRD has permitted the University to seek approval of MHRD/UGC while creating teaching or non-teaching posts or fill vacant posts, the University has sought approval for the post of chief of university security, fire officer, seven deputy registrars, dean, college development council, medical officers and vacant posts of associate professors and professors in the reserved category.
 
 A person was selected for the post of chief of university security but UGC approval to his appointment is pending. Selections for deputy registrars have been made. However, the high court has restrained opening of recommendations of the selection committee till the disposal of a CWP filed by an employee who did not get called for the interview. 
 
 Applications for the post of dean, college development council have been screened but the date of interview has not been fixed in view of an earlier directive of UGUMHRD to freeze all recruitments in PU. Posts of medical officers are vacant, but temporary arrangements have been made against some of these vacant positions.
