Visakhapatnam: Hailstorms swept parts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts for nearly 30 minutes on Monday. 

 Hail stones weighing around 250 to 500 grams pounded the areas.
 
 P Adinarayana, a resident of Pendurty, said, “Squall and hailstorm was witnessed for nearly half an hour. Crops and some thatched huts were partially damaged in the area.”
 
 The core city, however, did not witness any hailstorm, said meteorologists.
 
 Officials from the Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC), Visakhapatnam, said the airport and its surrounding areas received 7mm rainfall till 5.30 pm, while the city’s Waltair observatory centre recorded 0.5 mm. The hailstorm was brought by the cumulonimbus clouds, which occur in summer due to sudden rise in temperature. Speaking to TOI, India Meteorological Department director (forecast) K Nagaratnam said it was the first hailstorm in a large scale this summer in north coastal Andhra Pradesh. Hailstorms occur in summer for a short period followed by thunder showers and rain. Hailstorms damage crops, particularly mango and cashew, she said.
