Shoojit Sircar’s 'October', a story about love and relationships, stars Varun Dhawan and Banita Sandhu in lead roles. The track list consists of five delectable numbers that are strikingly different from each other, yet retain a common thread that links them together in a subtle way. This one is definitely not your usual Bollywood movie album, but a rather cerebral, creative one. 
 
 That   is a good singer comes across well in the first number 'Theher Ja', with the way he handles this upbeat, all-mush song. The lyrics by Abhiruchi Chand are as much a winner in this track as is Abhishek Arora’s music. Debuting the   20 Charts at number seven this week, this simple love song stays with you long after you have pressed stop.
 
 That music can be powerful in itself without the need for lyrics is affirmed when you listen to the 'October Theme'. Take a bow Shantanu Moitra.
 
 The song, 'Tab Bhi Tu' penned by Tanveer Ghazi and composed by Anupam Roy begins with a masterful alaap by Rahat and all through you get to hear his skilful rendition. This acoustic track has some good music, including flute by  , acoustic guitar and bass by Sanjoy Das, electric guitar by Rishabh Ray, drums by Sandipan Parial and tabla by  .
 
 The next, 'Manwaa' is about the super combo of singer Sunidhi Chauhan, composer Shantanu Moitra and lyricist Swanand Kirkire; it goes to show what all can happen in Bollywood music when creativity and talent decide to work in tandem. This classical-based composition will leave you asking for more.
 
 Another fresh track by Shantanu, 'Chal' has been sung by the golden-voiced and sometimes under-rated, but talented singer Monali Thakur. The lyrics by Tanveer Ghazi win you over with their simplicity.
