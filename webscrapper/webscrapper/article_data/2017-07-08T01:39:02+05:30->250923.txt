MUMBAI: Even after the hike in the non-tuition  , there will remain a 20% deficit on IIT-Bombay’s expenditure. The institute’s administration released the   on the non-tuition fee increase from this year late on Friday evening. 

 The report detailed the need, the mandate, the rationale and the impact of the fee increase on students and it concluded that the rise was not only justified but also reasonable. The protesting students will now study the report, hold a meeting on Saturday and be prepared for negotiations on Monday.
 
 Post-graduate students from the institute had been protesting against the new fees for over a month. After they went on a hunger strike early this week, the institute decided to study the expenditure and come out with a white paper.
