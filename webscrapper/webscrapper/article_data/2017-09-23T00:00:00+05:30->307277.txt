It might be four years since the Kannada cult film   released, but those who worked in the film have always been in demand not just in Sandalwood, but in other industries, too. After the film’s female lead, Sruthi Hariharan, the lead   will now make his Tamil debut with   (TEN) director Anis’s film.

 Talking about the film,   says, “I have always wanted to be a part of the Tamil film industry and I have been getting plenty of offers since Lucia. The kind of films that are being made here are fabulous. So, I wanted to choose the right film as my debut. When   approached me with this script, I couldn’t refuse. It is a gangster subject and my role has different shades. We will be filming from December.” Anis adds, “This story is a blend of a popular epic and instances from a real-life incident. Sathish fits the role perfectly. We will go on floors in December and will be shooting in Chennai and  , among other locations.” Meanwhile, Sathish says, “I want to dub in Tamil and have already begun taking lessons in the language. I should pick up Tamil before I begin shooting.”
