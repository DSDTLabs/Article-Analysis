Chennai: In an emotional response to the   controversy, writer-lyricist   appealed to the Tamil people not to react as his words have been “taken out of context” even after repeated apologies. 

 “After we have tried to bring this to a closure, if they continue to twist words and kindle casteist and communal violence, Tamil society, you are an enlightened one, you will understand,” he said in a statement issued on Saturday.
 
 Vairamuthu landed himself in a controversy over his reference to Hindu deity Andal as a ‘dasi’ in an essay he wrote earlier this month.
 
  “I have had to bear numerous abuses because of this — abuses in action, in words, in writing and in social media. I have borne with all this disgrace. I will drink every drop of venom. Let Tamil society drink the elixir alone. If you accept this explanation, you will understand both Andal and Vairamuthu,” he said.
 
 Speaking on the article that evoked the controversy, Vairamuthu said such a celebrated article has been maligned by a few. 
 
 “Either to bring politics into religion or to bring religion into politics, my words have been twisted and spread,” he said.
 
 “They have secretly ‘scissored’ out the word ‘Deva’(God) from ‘Devadasi’. The first news spread saying, Vairamuthu has called Aandaal a ‘Dasi’. Then, people down the line twisted ‘Dasi’ into ‘Vesi’ (prostitute). I feel ashamed when I think that I have to nurture Tamil in such a crowd,” he added. 
 
 The lyricist said ancient Tamil, young Tamil, rich Tamil seemed to burst forth from Andal’s Tamil, like the flowers of spring. 
 
 “This is what I celebrated in my speech,” Vairamuthu said.
