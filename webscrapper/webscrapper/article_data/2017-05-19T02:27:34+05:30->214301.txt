MUMBAI: Citizens are being deprived of gardens and playgrounds due to the lethargic approach of government agencies in acquiring   for public use. 

 A reply to a Right To Information ( ) query has revealed that there are 166 plots across the city which need to be acquired for schools, playgrounds, gardens, roads, market and vehicle parking plots.
 
 These plots are mostly private and the   had   them to develop them for public in development plan (DP-1991). While some plots are vacant, some others have been encroached upon. The new DP is still to be cleared.
 
 “The collectorates have not done anything to acquire these plots for long due to which people can’t use them. It’s strange that the collectors’ offices have not acquired the plots despite receipt of funds from BMC to compensate landowners,” said RTI activist Anil Galgali.
 
 The   of Mumbai suburban district was not available for comment.
