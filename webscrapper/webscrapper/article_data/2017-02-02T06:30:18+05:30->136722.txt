PATNA: ‘Infrastructure’ status to affordable housing and shorter capital gain tax period will provide much-needed momentum to Bihar’s stagnant real estate sector, said realtors about the Budget presented in Parliament on Wednesday even as they described it as a potential game changer.

 “Affordable housing is a potential game changer as economically weaker sections and lower income group constitute a large population. Developers working on affordable housing projects will now be eligible for subsidies, tax benefits and access to preferential loan and lower borrowing rates from banks. They will be in a position to pass a lot of these benefits on to buyers,” said CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India)’s honorary secretary Sachin Chandra.
 
 Capital gain tax period has been reduced from three to two years, which means reduced tax burden for someone who sells a house after two years of purchase.
 
 “This will benefit the middle income groups as well as investors. Currently, if a property is sold within three years of buy, the profit is treated as a short-term capital gain and taxed. If the property is sold after three years, it is considered long-term capital gain and taxed less. People would therefore wait for three years for selling a property. However, they can now sell it even after two years,” said   (BAI)’s Patna chairman Navendu Thakur.
 
 The Budget also proposes creation of one crore houses for the poor by 2019 and training to 5 lakh masons by 2022. “States like Bihar face crisis of trained construction manpower. Thus Bihar gets doubly benefited,” said Manikant, BAI’s former national vice-president.
