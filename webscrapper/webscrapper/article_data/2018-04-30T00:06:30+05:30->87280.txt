Graphic released separately Pune: Women teachers from zilla parishad schools in Maharashtra will now get preference over their male counterparts in the newly introduced online transfer system announced on Wednesday.  Teachers in the interiors of the state will get a chance to teach at schools closer home. Over one lakh transfers would be made in the next year. Rural development minister Pankaja Munde announced on Wednesday that the online system was introduced for transparency.  Previously, the system was based on counselling of teachers. After a group of teachers approached the court opposing the new policy for transfers, Munde said the court had given the go ahead to the policy laid down by the state government. According to Rahul Shinde of Durgam Shikshak Sanghatana, “The policy clearly states that the women teachers need to be given priority so that they are with their family while doing their jobs. This will be the biggest advantage of clearing the policy and implementing the transfer process.” Women teachers, especially from rural parts of Maharashtra, suffered the most with postings away from home. Lakshmi Shelar from the Satara district said, “At present, my posting has been made at a school which is few km away from my home. But earlier, I was in a different taluka and school was in extreme interiors. I could not spend more than eight months there without my family. I had almost decided to quit my job. But later my request applications to make my posting closer to home helped and it was done.” The state government has decided to make this process online to maintain transparency during the transfer process. This decision will help stop political interference and curb monetary transactions.
