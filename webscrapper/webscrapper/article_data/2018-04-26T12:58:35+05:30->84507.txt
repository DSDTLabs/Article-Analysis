PATNA: At least 115   cases were reported across Bihar from January till March this year, as per the monthly surveillance report available on the state health society’s website. Of these, 102 were caused by plasmodium vivax parasite and 13 by plasmodium falciparum parasite. 

 The health department has also identified seven out of 38 districts as malaria-endemic zones. “The most dangerous form of malaria with the highest rates of f life-threatening complications and mortality is caused by plasmodium falciparum,” All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna’s (AIIMS-P) associate professor Dr   told this reporter on Wednesday.
 
 For most people, symptoms of malaria like fever, headache, muscle ache, tiredness, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea begin 10 days to 4 weeks after infection.
 
 According to epidemiologist  , the state health society issues a malaria alert to district magistrates, civil surgeons and government hospitals due to a rising risk of acquiring the disease during the monsoon season.
 
 “While government hospitals have to ensure that they have sufficient amount of anti-malarial medicines, the district administration makes sure that waterlogging does not occur. Dirty stagnant water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” Mishra said.
