Nagpur: The suicide by a 20-year-old married woman harassed for dowry has led to the arrests of four persons of a family on Wednesday. Puja Wanjari, fed up of relentless mental and physical torture by husband Rahul and his family, had ended her life at Neri village on January 10. 

 Police said Puja and Rahul had a love marriage on August 1 last year despite opposition of her parents. Rahul, who owns a tyre puncture repair business, had befriended Puja while visiting her married sister’s place at Bhamewadi, which is the native village of the deceased. 
 
 Shortly after marriage, Puja began to be harassed and tortured over dowry demands. Police said Puja and her mother-in-law Nirupa had a wordy duel over cleaning of utensils before the woman took the drastic decision. Puja had her meal before she went to bed. Her husband was asleep when she hanged herself from the ceiling rafter with a scarf. Rahul discovered Puja’s hanging body when he woke up in the morning.
 
 Apart from Rahul and her mother Nirupa, New Kamptee police have also booked Puja’s father-in-law Narayan and brother-in-law Sanket for torturing the deceased on a regular basis demanding cash and valuables from her parents. Initially, a case of accidental death was registered at New Kamptee police station but later it was changed to book four persons. 
 
 New Kamptee police invoked charges of dowry death and abetment to suicide of the young woman.
