VADODARA: Veterinary doctors at the   zoo examined the body of the hippopotamus calf that is believed to have died soon after birth or was still born on Tuesday. The officials have ruled out the possibility of the calf having died due to external injuries.

 The detailed examination was conducted on Wednesday after preserving the calf overnight. The officials could not see any external injuries on the skin of the calf. This ruled out the possibility of the male hippopotamus amongst the pair at the zoo having attacked it after birth.
 
 The calf was buried after the examination. Sources said that being animals of origin outside the country, hippopotamuses are not scheduled animals and it was not mandatory to conduct an autopsy on them.
