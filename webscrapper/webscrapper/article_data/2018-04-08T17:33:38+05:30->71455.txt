MUMBAI: Doctors of Mumbai's JJ Hospital, where Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani Mukherjea was rushed in an unconscious state on Friday night, have ruled out poisoning and stroke, but not drug overdose yet.

 The results of the stomach lavage (wash), which could reveal a drug overdose, if any, are expected on Sunday. If it’s positive, this would be the second time: the former media executive was rushed to JJ Hospital on October 2, 2015 due to an alleged drug overdose.
 
 A source said that her “pinpoint pupils”’ point to drug overdose. “Her blood and fluid samples have been sent to both government-run Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina and P D Hinduja Hospital in Mahim. The results of these toxicology tests will reveal a lot,’’ the source added. At the jail, Indrani has been under treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes and depression.
 
 According to the hospital, Indrani, who was arrested in August 2015, was rushed to the emergency department with “sudden unconsciousness’’ around 11.40 pm on Friday. While her vitals were normal, she was in altered sensorium (altered level of consciousness). She underwent CT and MRI scans that showed small vessel changes, but doctors said these could be due to age and blood pressure. A serum acetylcholinesterase blood test ruled out any pesticide poisoning, said a health update given out by the hospital on Saturday.
 
 JJ Hospital dean Dr S D Nanandkar and medical superintendent Dr Sanjay Surase said Indrani’s condition was “improving”. Dr Surase said, “When she was brought in she only responded to deep pain stimulation, but she is now responding to verbal commands.’’ Her vital parameters such as heart rate are normal.
 
 Hospital officials said drug overdose is only one of the causes they are looking at. The jail authorities are expected to submit a report on her health to the court next week. The next hearing in the murder trial is scheduled for Wednesday.
