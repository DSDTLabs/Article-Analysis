NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has failed to conclusively prove charges of sedition slapped on former JNU student union president   in connection with an event held at the campus on February 9 last year.

 This has come to the fore from the draft chargesheet filed in the case, details of which were shared by sources.The chargesheet, however, indicts JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya. Khalid, cops say , even got anti-India posters made for the event to show solidarity with  .
 
 The chargesheet cites the forensic reports of around 40 video clips which prove that anti-India slogans were raised at JNU that day .
 
 Regarding Kanhaiya, cops have left it to the court to decide if charges are to be framed against him, sources say . The chargesheet nowhere says Kanhaiya raised anti-India slogans but does say he did nothing to stop them or the event.
 
 The chargesheet to be filed under section 121 A (sedition) and criminal conspiracy is before the police commissioner and a final nod for submission is awaited. Nine `outsiders' have been identified. All of them are from Kashmir. Some are from other universities and a few are working professionals who are accused of raising `antiIndian slogans'. Though videos showed 140-odd protesters, `nine' were identified,“ said a source.
 
 After assuring them that no legal action, that is arrest, would be taken, their statements were recorded.A few had gone to Kashmir and some refused to come when the valley witnessed unrest following the Burhan Wani killing.
 
 The witnesses include JNU administration and JNU students affiliated with  , students affiliated with   and security guards.
 
 Also, a few students who were part of the organising committee have been made witnesses.
 
 A CFSL report says the video clip shot by a Hindi channel was not tampered with. The clips which turned out to be fake were not taken “on record“ by the police.
