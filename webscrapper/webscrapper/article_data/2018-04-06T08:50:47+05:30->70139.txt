BENGALURU: Citizens will soon be able to test their   quotient (EQ) via an app launched by chief election commissioner Om Prakash   on Thursday.

 Three mobile applications were launched at the inauguration of a special one-week exhibition on the upcoming assembly elections, being held at Chitrakala Parishath.
 
 The apps — Election Quiz,   Reporting and Election Officers’ Directory — have been created by BBMP. The first one is to test voter awareness, the second to report any violation of the model code of conduct and the third is a repository of phone numbers of all poll officers, including flying squad members, returning officers, MCC officers and others, arranged constituency-wise. The Election Quiz app has many sets of 10 multiple-choice questions for voters and ranks their performance on a scale of 10. Whoever scores 10 is declared an ‘election genius’.
 
 The exhibition lays bare everything about polls — from the voting procedure and electoral processes to what voters should be aware of. A video hall showcases information about the history of elections: 12 videos, four in   and eight in English, will be played for visitors.
 
 Rawat, who’s in the state to review poll preparations along with two other poll commissioners, said since the theme of the upcoming polls is inclusive, accessible and ethical elections, the exhibition aims at enhancing voter awareness, particularly on the working of EVMs or voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) systems.
