GURUGRAM: More than 60 fully-grown trees were felled on Thursday near  , an educational institute in  .

 The environmental violation came to light when the   carried out an inspection in the area. Sources said the trees were felled with help of earth moving machines in the   plantation area.
 
 The forest department confirmed chopping of 60 trees, and filed a complaint with police. “No permission was granted to fell the trees. We have already filed a report, and a police complaint. Felling of trees is on the rise in the area. We asked police to take strict action against the offenders,” said an official at the district forest department, Faridabad.
 
 “The decrease in the number of protection watchers is making the situation worse. The number of the protection watchers has come down by almost 50 per cent. We are now planning to put in place measures to increase manpower for better vigilance,” said MD Sinha, conservator of forests, Gurgaon Circle.
 
 Environmentalists blamed police for inaction. “Though the forest department is taking steps to tackle tree felling, no action is being taken by police against violators. A lot of people want to encroach upon land as it is a prime area. There is a need to take a joint action by police and the forest department,” said Jitender Bhadana from Save Aravali, an environmental NGO.
 
 A forest official told TOI that it was an attempt to encroach upon the Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ) area by big real estate players.
 
 “In 2014, the Centre came up with directions that at least 10 per cent tree cover is needed to call an area a forest. Tree felling near Indraprastha Gurukul is an attempt to clear Aravali plantation so that no trees are left in the area so that can be easily be encroached upon,” said a senior forest official on condition of anonymity.
