GHAZIABAD: A number of job   who have posted their resume on employment websites have complained that they have been getting emails from people posing as HR officials of Larsen and Toubro and are being told to deposit around Rs 10,000 in a bank account before appearing for an interview.

 
 Rahul Mishra (29), a mechanical engineer who lives near Ghaziabad railway station, said he received an email four days ago in which the sender asked him to deposit Rs 9,850 into accounts in Dena or Vijaya banks by May 19 if he wanted to appear for an L&T interview in Chennai on June 6. “The mail did not specify any account number but asked me to call senior manager Satish Yuvraj for getting the details,” he added.
 
 “I called Yuvraj and he gave me the account details. I sensed something amiss and contacted the company. They denied issuing any such letter and advised me not to deposit any money. When I confronted Yuvraj, he abused me. I have since written to UP police seeking an action against this attempt to cheat people,” Mishra added.
 
 Crime branch inspector Dinesh Yadav said: “Youngsters should know that no company asks for money to be deposited for any interview. We have received some complaints of this nature and are probing the matter.”
 
 L&T was yet to respond to an email seeking a reaction on the fraud   till late Monday evening.
