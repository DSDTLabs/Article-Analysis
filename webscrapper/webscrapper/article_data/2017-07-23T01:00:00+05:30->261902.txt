It is safe to say that actress   and   make a cute pair. They made us laugh in   and are said to have great chemistry in the yet-to-be-released,  . As for, Oru Nalla Naal Paathu Solren, Gayathrie says, “We have a different kind of chemistry in this film. Our roles are quite unusual, so the dynamics of the pair also changes.” 

 Gayathrie plays one of the female actors alongside Niharika Konidela, who is paired opposite Gautham Karthik. While Gautham plays an urban guy, Sethupathi plays a tribal head in this film. Gayathrie says she had no second thoughts about taking up this film, when director Arumuga Kumar approached her. She says, “I was involved in the film for a long time. So, I knew the story. More than anything else, I am really excited about my look. I have never been offered something like this before and I don’t know when I will get an opportunity of this sort. And that’s one of the reasons I readily agreed. What is even more exciting is that all the characters in the film will be seen in a tribal song. It is more like a celebratory song for the tribal group. I had a lot of fun shooting for it.” The actress shot for her portions near Tirupati and in Chennai.
