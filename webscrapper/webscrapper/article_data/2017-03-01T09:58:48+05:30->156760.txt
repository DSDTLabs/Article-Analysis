 Now we’ve come across some fun videos from the function – one of them has Anil,   and Sonam dancing to ‘My name is Lakhan’ from ‘Ram Lakhan’. While Sonam leaves the dance floor after grooving for a while, the chacha-bhatija duo of Anil and   set the stage on fire with their moves. You’ve got to watch the ‘Ram Lakhan’ actor as he recreates his signature steps from the song.
