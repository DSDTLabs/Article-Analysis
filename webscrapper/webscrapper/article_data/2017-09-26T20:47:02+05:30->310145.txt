CUTTACK: The   on Tuesday rejected the   of industrialist   in connection with an attempt to murder case of a lawyer in 2013 in Cuttack.

 Mishra had moved   (SDJM) court here for bail after police had filed chargesheet against him in the case. Mishra had pleaded that police have already completed its investigation and filed charge-sheet in the case, hence he should be granted bail in the matter.
 
 However, government counsel vehemently opposed the bail plea citing that Mishra is an influential person and if he is granted bail then he would tamper the evidences.
 
 “The court rejected the bail plea as he is the main conspirator of the crime,” said Biswajit Baral, government counsel. In 2013, a lawyer Abhay Bhatt was allegedly attacked with bombs at the behest of Mishra.
 
 Notably, the High Court on May 16 had granted conditional bail to Industrialist and Odisha Stevedores Limited (OSL) Managing Director in connection with Seaways Shipping general manager Mahendra Swain murder case. But as two other cases are pending against him, Mishra is not able to walk out of jail.
