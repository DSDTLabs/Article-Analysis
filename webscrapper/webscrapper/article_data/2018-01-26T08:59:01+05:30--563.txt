CHANDIGARH: It has been nearly a month that the officials of   have failed to complete their task of laying   under a lane that is behind a row of restaurants and hotels in  .

 The lane had been reeling under severe civic distress due to issues like overflowing sewers, multiple manholes, foul smell, etc. Hence, the residents, restaurant and shop owners requested the   (MC) to look into the matter.
 
  used to cover most parts of the road, especially the end of the road. Initially it was noticed that the overflowing manholes were the main cause of the mess here. But later, we learned that several spotson the road and drainage pipes of the restaurants were also damaged,” said Aryan Sharma, an employee of a shop here.
 
 Meanwhile, the civic officials have said that the new sewer line is at least six inches wider than the previous sewer line. “The earlier sewer line was thin and was not adequate to channelise the flow of water,” said Tarshem Singh, a Munshi working with construction workers.
 
 “The task is time consuming as the officials are connecting the newly-inserted sewer line to all the manholes. The entire lane had to be dug open,” a shopkeeper said.
 
 The ongoing construction has also reduced the space here, which is stalling the mobility of traffic.
 
 “We are facing minor traffic jams, especially in the evening. The rush hours have become difficult to manage," said a traffic cop.
