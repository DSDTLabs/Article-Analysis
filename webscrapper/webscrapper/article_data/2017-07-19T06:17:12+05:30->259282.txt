CHENNAI: As the Supreme Court asked the Central government to take a decision soon on the policy for the commercial release and cultivation of genetically modified crops like the GM  , veteran agriculture scientist   recalled some points that he wrote in a report in 2004. 

 “In this connection I wish to recall what I wrote in a report submitted to the ministry of agriculture in 2004. ‘The bottom line for any biotechnology regulatory policy should be the safety of the environment, the well-being of farming families, the ecological and economic sustainability of farming systems, the health and nutrition security of consumers, safeguarding of home and external trade, and the biosecurity of our nation.’”
 
 Swaminathan said he had stressed that while evolving a regulatory policy, “we should first find out whether the objective the breeder has could be achieved through non-GMO methods including marker assisted selection.”
 
  “I also pointed out that the recombinant DNA technology is best used for introducing characters related to drought, floods, coastal storms and other non-biotic stresses. In the case of biotic stresses including Bt cotton, there will be mutations and a need to replace the variety frequently. I hope a policy which is in the best interest of the farmer, the country and the environment will be developed soon without further delay,” he said in a statement issued by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation on Tuesday.
