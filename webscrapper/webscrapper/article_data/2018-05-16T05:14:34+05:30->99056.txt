NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the CBI to investigate the allegations of   and physical torture on several prisoners lodged in the high risk ward of   Jail.

 
 Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said prison officials do not need to resort to violent methods to manage their jails, and just because a person in uniform is inflicting the violence, the act does not get decriminalised. The court, consequently, directed the jail officials to forward to the CBI all the records as well as the reports of two fact-finding committees set up to look into the incident of November 21, 2017 when 18 prisoners were allegedly beaten up by the prison staff.
 
 The fact finding committee had in February, this year, recommended that an   be registered against the security personnel involved. It had then named members of the   special police (TSP) as those who should be booked.
 
 During the hearing on Tuesday, Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra informed the bench that while excesses were committed by the jail staff and personnel of Tamil Nadu Special Police, criminal proceedings may not be initiated against. Mehra said the jail officials were working under stressful conditions in an overcrowded prison.
 
 The court was acting on a PIL by advocate Chinmay Kanojia, who has alleged that his client Shahid Husuf, being investigated by the NIA, was beaten up without any reason by the Tihar Jail staff.
