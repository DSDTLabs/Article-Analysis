Canadian-Moroccan actress  , who has been part of films like Baahubali, has been roped in for Rosshan Andrrews’ upcoming Nivin Pauly-starrer  . 

 The actress will be seen performing a sensuous dance to a song that will also feature the movie’s protagonist Nivin, and they have started the shoot in Goa.
 Nora, who has also been part of the Prithviraj film Double Barrel in the past, says, “It’s been four days since I started working on the movie and we are having a gala time, shooting the sequence in Goa. The song is set in an environment where you also have a handful of foreigners and the wealthy. I guess Nivin’s character plans a heist amid the colourful atmosphere, which would sure distract those present.”
 
 The actress says that the flavour of the dance is quite Indian, despite the presence of British and other foreign characters. “It is choreographed by Vishnu Deva and the costumes and movements are fashioned to portray that of the 19th century perfectly. The team is very particular about getting every minute detail right,” says Nora, who has also been part of Tollywood films like Kick 2. The actress will soon be shooting with Nivin in the upcoming days as well.
