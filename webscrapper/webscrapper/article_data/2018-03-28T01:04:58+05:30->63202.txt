NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday attacked   and the Centre during a discussion on the budget in Delhi assembly claiming that they were “hampering the work of the   government”. He singled out Baijal for “not clearing the doorstep delivery of ration”.

 “I called upon the LG and requested him to clear the proposal. I am very sad that despite a CM’s request he did not consult me before rejecting the proposal,” Kejriwal said.
 
 Taking on the central government on the escape of businessman Nirav Modi and the plight of traders due to sealing, Kejriwal patted the back of his own government and claimed that more work was done in the past three years than what other states could do in 70 years.
 
 Kejriwal also accused BJP of indulging in “dirty politics” and claimed that the party was “stalling” the work of the AAP government by using the bureaucracy.
 
 Claiming that the budget was passed in Parliament without discussion, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that the AAP government gave enough room to the opposition members to speak on the budget discussion.
 
 The assembly on Tuesday passed the Rs 53,000 crore budget for 2018-19, with a major thrust on green initiatives to combat rising air pollution.
 
 Leader of opposition Vijender Gupta claimed that the Centre has been generous in providing financial assistance to the state despite   regularly cursing it.
 
 Meanwhile, the speaker adjourned the assembly for half an hour as a mark of protest after the home department “declined” to give a reply to a question related to the constitution of thana (police station) level committees in the city. This question was forwarded to the privilege committee of the assembly.
