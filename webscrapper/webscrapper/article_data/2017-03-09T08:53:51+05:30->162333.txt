CHENNAI: More than 7,000 students in Tamil Nadu wrote the   in their   on the day one of the   after the state granted exemption to students of   from writing the Tamil paper on Wednesday.

 Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan on Wednesday said that as per the orders of the High Court, the Tamil Nadu education department exempted 7,327 candidates from writing the Tamil language paper in the 10th standard examination. A total of 10,33,908 students appeared for the exam across 3,371 centers in the state.
 
 However, the clarity on whether these 7,000 odd students would be allowed to exemption came much later than expected. Until late Tuesday evening, only 2,939 candidates had been exempted from writing the Tamil examination. It was as late as 8.30 pm in several districts when district education officers called for meetings with school heads and told them to allow other linguistic minority students to write the language of their choice, said headmasters who attended the meeting.
 
 Despite the delay, most students performed without much hassle, said school heads. This is also because several schools have made students prepare, not for one, but for two languages. “We have been coaching students in both Tamil and Telugu, so they would be confident in both subjects. Students had to put in extra efforts to prepare for two languages, right from the beginning,” said a school teacher from SKDT Higher Secondary School, Villivakkam.
 
 This has been the case in several schools. However, linguistic minority forums pointed out that the confusion could have been avoided. The TN linguistic minority forum said it was happy that the education department had been generous and sympathetic toward the students of linguistic minorities. “We feel that a three-language formula is the best solution to this ticklish issue,” the group said.
