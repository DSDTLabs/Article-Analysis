 A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra agreed to hear the petition tomorrow. The film is scheduled for release on  .
 
 Some reports say four states - 
  , 
  and 
  - have banned the film from being screened. All of these states are ruled by the BJP.
 
 The film's producer, in the petition, said that the film has undergone many changes - including that of the title - to meet the suggestions of the Censor Board.
 
 The producer questioned the power of the state governments to impose a complete ban on the film when the SC in an earlier case clarified that screening of a film can only be suspended in a particular area because of the law and order situation in that area, it cannot be completely banned.
 
  
  
 
 On December 30, the Censor Board cleared the film for release with a UA certificate and suggested its name be changed from the earlier ' ' to "Padmavat"; the film maker's complied albeit with an extra 'a' in the name.
 
 
 
 Yesterday, Haryana announced it was banning the screening of 'Padmaavat'. The Haryana cabinet headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar formally approved the proposals made by two ministers 
  and Vipul Goel to ban the film in the state. "Film Padmavati/Padmaavat banned in Haryana," Vij tweeted yesterday.
 
 The film had faced stiff opposition from some BJP leaders in Haryana. In November, both Vij and Goel had urged information and broadcasting minister Smriti Irani to ban the film.
 
 Controversial Haryana BJP leader Suraj Pal Amu, who had quit as party's chief media coordinator in November, had led protests against the film and had even offered 10 crore as "reward to behead" Bhansali and the film's lead actor 
 . Accusing the Haryana CM of "humiliating" the Rajput community, Amu had called him "arrogant".
