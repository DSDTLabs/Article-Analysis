THANE: An abandoned ground-plus-two storey structure that was constructed illegally on the   side was razed to the ground in a day-long   undertaken by the   (TMC) on Tuesday.

 Civic officials said that the owner of the   tat was demolished on Tuesday was given eight days’ notice to clear their machinery, after which they took the action.
 
 “While the industry that was once running in the building was shut down a while ago, their machinery was still in it. Many sand miners were also using the premises to store some of their stock. We gave them over a week to remove it all and then immediately took action,” said a senior civic official.
 
 The drive involved a team of 50 plus labourers and officials working with three poclain machines, five gas cutters and one crane.
 
 “The action took the whole day as the structure was built with metal and concrete, which had to be cut into and broken down thoroughly,” added the civic official.
