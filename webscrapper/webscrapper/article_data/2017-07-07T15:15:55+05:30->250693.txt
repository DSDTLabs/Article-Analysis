 The 52-year-old actor, who as  , plays a mentor to the young Spider-Man/   essayed by Tom Holland in ' : Homecoming', said the young actor was the best choice to play the web-spinning superhero.
 
 "I never thought I'd wind being like a father figure to another avenger but I couldn't pick a better character or actor to do it with," Robert said on the red carpet at the world premiere of 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'. 
 
 The   star added despite the gap in his and Holland's ages, he did not feel threatened in his role. "Sometimes you figure if someone isn't mature enough yet to portray you, you feel comfortable. That comes with age," he said.
