Ahmedabad: We see them everywhere — negotiating their way across traffic signals, sitting unmoved in the middle of the road and even masticating garbage.   are an unpleasant reality of   roads where they caus traffic jams, and even injure and kill commuters. 

 Soon, however, stray cattle will be rehabilitated in animal hostels some 5 km outside city limits near SP Ring Road.
 
 The process of identifying land is going on at   (AMC) which has already held two meetings on the subject after the AMC budget. A Rs1 crore budget has been set aside for conducting a feasibility study. To start with, land for at least three medium-sized cattle hostels in the south and new west zone is being identified.
 
 AMC official said the pastoralist association will be asked to pay a small fee towards maintaining the hostels. “Also, its members will have to travel to the hostel to attend to their animals,” the official said. “Each cattle head will be tagged with an RFID and their owners will be heavily fined or even jailed if they allow the animals to stray outside.” Officials at the civic body said that a special set of rules on cattle menace will be framed.
 
 However, there is a catch. The cattle economy relies heavily on devotees feeding fresh grass by paying a minimum Rs 10 to Rs 15 and even feed leftover food to cows at junctions and in residential areas. The pastrolist does not have to bother much about spending on cattle fodder. 
 
 “The milk is then sold. The money earned from milk is loaned to the needy at hefty interest rates. If we shift the hostels outside the city, the   will protest,” the AMC official said.
 
 A similar project of translocating cattle outside the city is underway in Rajkot. Here Maldharis have sat with the   to identify spots for their relocation along with cattle. In December last year, the RMC distributed forms. But AMC officials claim that a similar Rajkot model had failed in Ahmedabad.
