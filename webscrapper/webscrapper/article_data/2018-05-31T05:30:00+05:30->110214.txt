Mysuru: Employees of nationalised banks in the city on Wednesday struck work on Wednesday as part of the two-day strike called by the All India Bank Employees’ Association to protest the proposed hike of 2% in their salaries.

 The employees assembled at the District Lead Bank in Saraswathipuram, where they raised slogans against the central government. The employees had demanded a hike of 15% in their salaries, and the announcement of a 2% hike has not gone down well with them.
 
 The employees, who took out a protest rally from the District Lead Bank and marched across some of the major roads, urging the Centre to reconsider its position on the revision of their salaries. Overtures of reconciliation made by the government to nationalised banks on May 5 had failed, said the protesting employees. “While Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi left the country without paying their loans, demands of the bank employees have gone unheeded,” the employees said. 
 
 The aggrieved employees pointed to the role they had essayed in implementing some of the central government’s schemes such as demonetisation, Jan Dhan Yojana, Atal Pension Scheme and Mudra schemes. “And yet, we have been deprived of a wage hike,” they said.
 
 The employees pointed out that, although banks were closed, measures had been taken to ensure public were not inconvenienced. “They can still use online banking, and there is enough cash in ATMs,” they added.
 
 President of the All India Bank Employees’ Association, Mysuru Shivaprasad, and members Prasanna, Gururaj, Ravindra and Bhaskar Pai were among those who participated in the protest.
