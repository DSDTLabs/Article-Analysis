 The black panther cub, aged around 12-14 months, was found dead in Masinagudi range of forests in MTR. “One of the forelegs of the animal was found broken and its skull was damaged too,” Saravanan, deputy director of MTR told TOI. “The cub might have been attacked by a carnivore. The preliminary postmortem report revealed that the animal hadn’t taken food for at least 10 days,” he added.
 
 The cub, the official said, might not have been able to move because of the wound and starved.
 
 Just 300 metres away from the black panther cub’s carcass, two leopards were found dead. “Both were female leopards aged around one-and-a-half years,” the official said. Samples of the carcasses were collected for lab test. “Only after the test report is out, we could ascertain the cause of death,” MTR deputy director said.
 
 A partially eaten carcass of a spotted deer was also found in the area. “The preliminary postmortem report did not reveal the animal’s cause of death. But its meat was found in leopards’ stomach,” Saravanan added.
 
 Government veterinary doctor in Masinagudi performed postmortem operation of all the three animals in the presence of an NGO, local body representatives and higher forest officials as per the norms prescribed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). All the proceedings were duly recorded.
 
 After the autopsy, the carcasses were burnt inside the forest.
 
 In another instance, a female elephant aged around 35 years reportedly died after it fell down from a higher terrain in Thengumarahada range of forests in the Nilgiris north division.
