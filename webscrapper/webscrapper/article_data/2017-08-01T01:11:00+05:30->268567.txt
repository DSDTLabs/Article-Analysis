Tirupur: A few Class 12 students from Samacheer Kalvi (uniform syllabus), who wrote the exams last year petitioned the district   K S Palanisamy on Monday urging the central government to exempt the state from   in the medical admissions this year. 

 “It was difficult for the state board students get good marks in NEET, because most of the questions were asked out of CBSE syllabus, there are a lot of differences in both the syllabus,” S Suguna, one of the petitioners said, adding that the state board student who has 199.25 medical cutoff could secure only 37% in the NEET.
 
 “Moreover, the students who came from the modest background and Tamil medium suffered the most in NEET. They didn’t have sufficient time to prepare of the exam. It is good that the state government was trying to get an exemption for students in Tamil Nadu. However, if they fail, the lives of many medical aspirants will be hard,” she added.
 
 The petitioners said that while many of their careers were uncertain, many private NEET coaching centres are trying to make money by pressing the demand for conduction medical admissions as per the NEET. Hence, the government should ensure that the admissions are done as per the performances in the Class 12 exams, they said.
