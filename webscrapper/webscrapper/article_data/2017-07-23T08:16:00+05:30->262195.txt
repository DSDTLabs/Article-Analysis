Panaji: Nearly a month after   front paged the report that primary school students had not received the free raincoats, uniforms and notebooks they are eligible for under a state scheme, the government has said the supply of raincoats was completed on June 28.

 On June 22, TOI had reported 90,000 students were waiting for their free raincoats, uniforms and notebooks. On July 20, director of information and publicity Srinet Kothwale, in a letter, said: “According to the directorate of  , the supply of raincoats to the 12 taluka ADEI offices has been completed on June 28 and the distribution to students enrolled in Classes I to III of government primary schools is in progress.”
 
 He also said the supply of uniforms to the offices of the additional district education inspectors (ADEI) was scheduled to be completed by the end of first week of July, according to the appointed suppliers of the uniform Goa Khadi and Village Industries Board, Panaji.
 
 “The supply of notebooks to 12 ADEI offices has been completed on June 30 and the distribution of notebooks to the students enrolled in Class II, III and IV is in progress,” Kothwale has said.
 
 On July 4, TOI had reported that the state government had begun distribution of the free raincoats, uniforms and notebooks that primary school students of government and government-aided schools are eligible for. 
 
 The two TOI reports had also highlighted the delay in supplying the items year after year and that it takes at least another week for the supply to reach students after they are handed to the ADEIs. The system put by DoE in place states that respective primary school teachers have to pick up supply from the district offices and this leads to further delay as Goa has over 350 schools run by a single teacher with absolutely no support staff to assist.
 
 Former director of education, IAS officer D P Dwivedi, had pointed out that the delay in supply is caused annually as orders for the items are placed only a month or so before the academic year is to begin.
