JIND: While the ruling BJP is claiming Thursday’s rally at   a big success, the opposition parties in Haryana termed it a flop show. They slammed the Union and the state government over “severe misuse of public money.”

 Haryana leader of the opposition   of INLD said the rally was unsuccessful despite the fact that sarpanchs in the villages were threatened and forced to send people to attend it. “I am told that around 150 companies of paramilitary forces were specially deployed for Amit Shah’s rally. Had the Centre provided these forces for construction of remaining part of the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal in Punjab, Haryana would have got its water share,” Abhay said.
 
 Former Haryana chief minister   said not only were the people of the state disappointed with the rally, BJP workers were too. “The empty chairs at the venue of rally points out that BJP has lost its face in the public. Around Rs 22 crore was spent on the security and other arrangements by the state. I completely fail to understand the purpose of the rally when no announcement was made for the state. Shah praised Haryana’s farmers and sportsperson but announced nothing for them,” he said.
 
 Senior BJP leader and party’s state media in-charge Rajiv Jain, however, said it was party workers’ rally in which only the active party workers were invited to listen to their president. “Despite cold weather, thousands of party workers had come to attend the rally by driving motorbikes for more than 200km. Opposition parties are upset with the success of the rally. Unlike the previous regimes, we have not forced the people to come to the rally in buses,” Jain added.
