 A resident of Madhavpuri locality in Kasganj, the 25-year-old is in construction business and had started social work through an NGO which was gradually joined by more than 200 volunteers. Chandan Gupta, the youth killed in the violence, and majority of other participants of tiranga yatra were associated with the same NGO.
 
 “I tagged everybody on Twitter, right from chief minister’s office to DGP headquarters and also Kasganj police. Tension had started building since January 19 and incriminating messages were being shared on social media platforms, especially on Facebook and WhatsApp,” said the youth, who did not want to be named.
 
 However, assuming them to be usual dissenting voices on social media, no one acted.
 
 “I was contacted by DGP headquarters on January 31, when all the damage was done. I feel sorry for all that took place. Had law enforcement agencies taken note of the messages or my tweets, things could have been different,” said the youth.
 
 “Local machinery needs to be activated immediately as soon as communal tension starts building up. It was not done in Kasganj,” said ADG law and order Anand Kumar.
