In all, 150 members of the world tourism organisation took measures each year to promote heritage and culture of various places on the day. This year’s theme is sustainable tourism – a tool for development. 
 
 Tourism has a lot of scope for enhancing the revenue of the nation and many initiatives are being carried out to attract tourists. What was important was to maintain every place clean and tidy as the first move to make it tourist-friendly, he said. On reaching the Thirumalai Naicker mahal, the walkers took a pledge to keep the city neat and clean. Madurai corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar, trainee collector Ranjith, district tourism officer S M Sribalamurugan among others were also present.
