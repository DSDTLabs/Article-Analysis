CHENNAI: To skill students from engineering-intensive streams like automobile, production and manufacturing, a centre of excellence lab will be set up at   (MIT),  .

 Students from engineering, polytechnic and   backgrounds can make use of the training courses which will be on offer. These courses will typically be certificate programmes and will help hone the skill sets of students to facilitate innovation and increase their employability chances.
 
 The centre, scheduled to come up next academic year, is a tie-up with German tech conglomerate Siemens and will offer training with an eye to create more leg room for automotive technology in India. This will be the nodal centre with four others being set up at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore, courtesy Siemens.The other centres will be across the state in institutions including University College of Engineering, Vellore and Anna University's   campus.

 It will be open not only to students of the university but those from colleges across the state, he added, saying the initiative will the pave way for more interdisciplinary projects and research work, a key driver of engineering opportunities.
 
 The project had been in the pipeline for a couple of years and will finally take shape in the form of a physical facility. This will soon be followed by other colleges as well.
