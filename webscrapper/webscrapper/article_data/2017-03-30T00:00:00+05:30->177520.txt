 has been on a signing spree lately and why not? 

 He has become one of the most bankable actors in Mollywood right now and is choosing movies with interesting premises.
  His latest signing, which will be directed by  , promises to be yet another interesting project. The movie is scripted by Dileesh Nair and Syam Pushkaran and is based on a story thread by filmmaker  .
 
 We recently got Amal Neerad to shed some light — though reluctantly — on the film. “It was one of the three stories that I had initially wanted to direct for the Anju Sundarikal anthology. The story is based on a real-life incident that I have heard about. But later I put it on hold and decided to proceed with Kullante Bharya,” says Amal.
 
 Anju Sundarikal also had Aashiq Abu helming a segment titled Gauri, which had Kavya Madhavan and Biju Menon. Amal Neerad says, “I had narrated the story to Aashiq, who is a good friend. He too liked it and that’s how he decided to direct the film. The script is now being developed by Syam and Dileesh.”
 
 However, the team is not ready to reveal more details on the project.
 
 Incidentally, the film’s lead Tovino’s Kollywood debut, directed by BR Vijayalakshmi, is also based on a true incident that happened in Brazil. The film is a love story with Tovino playing an “intense character”. 
 
 The actor has Godha, a wrestling-drama lined up for release next, and also has Tick Tock, a film based on time travel in 
 his kitty.
