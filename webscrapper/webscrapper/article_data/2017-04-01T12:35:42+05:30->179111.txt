NAGPUR: ‘Mahatma Ka Intezar’, a   set in the background of   that had all the twists and turns, kept the audience on the edge of seats at Dr   on Thursday.

 Adapted in Hindi from celebrated English writer   ‘Waiting for the Mahatma’, students of bachelor of vocational education (BVoc) of VMV College successfully recreated the era of freedom struggle. 
 
 The story begins to unfold when Sriram (Jay Gala), staying with his grandmother at village Malgudi in south India, gets attracted towards Bharati (Karishma Meshram), the girl of his age who is active in Mahatma Gandhi’s Quit India movement.
 
 Villagers also respond to the call by asking the Britishers to leave the country. A feeling of patriotism grips Sriram too and he takes part in the agitation, much against the wishes of his grandmother. 
 
 The British regime arrests and jails Sriram where his longing for Bharati grows. After his release, the twosome meet again. Gandhi (Parag Ghonge), who was taking care of Bharati, grants them permission to marry. The story takes a sudden turn when Gandhi was assassinated on the day they were to tie the nuptial knot. The dramatic end leaves the audience speechless. 
 
 Theatre director Chittaranjan Giri said, “As students were to perform on a big platform for the first time, I selected Narayan’s novel so that students could get familiar with the play. We set the play in about 33 days with constant improvisation,” he added. 
 
 Ghonge, coordinator of VMV College said, “The motto of staging the play was to give students exposure and showcase their talent.” 
 
 Abhay Mudgal, nodal officer of BVoc, was present.
