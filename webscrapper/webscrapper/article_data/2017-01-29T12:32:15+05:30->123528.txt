Shatrughan Sinha, who completed close to five decades in the film industry, was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 62nd Jio Filmfare Awards 2017. Veteran filmmaker Subhash Ghai, who has worked with Sinha in five films, was on stage to raise a toast to him, before the Lifetime Achievement Award was presented. Before presenting the award, Ghai opened with 'Jali ko aag kehte hain, bhuji ko raakh kehte hain ' line from 'Vishwanaath'. He further said, 'Shatru made Dharmendra question if he's the best looking actor. He made Amitabh Bachchan insecure of his acting chops. He is a dear friend of mine. In the 70s, he worked with all the stars of that era, he's very humble. He still cherishes every applause that he gets.'

  
  
 Ghai added, 'It doesn't matter if you come from a small town or you don't have money in your pocket, you can achieve big things if you have the confidence.' 
 
 The high point of the evening was when daughter Sonakshi Sinha presented her father with the award. Sonakshi said, 'He always talks how he loves the fact that I have one Filmfare and he doesn't. But I am very happy that he has received it today.'
 
 
 
 
 
 Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, the host of the show, were also present on the stage. Amitabh Bachchan praised Sinha too, 'Vishwa mein aise log bahut kam dekhne milte hain. (He is truly one of a kind.)'
 
 Shatrugan Sinha thanked everyone on stage for the award. He said, 'I've received my first Filmfare today. It's late in my career, but if you have the passion and determination, nothing can stop you from achieving what you want. Many people feel if you get a lifetime achievement award, then it's the end of your career, but I feel this is just the beginning of a new leg for me.' 
 
 He wished that his friendship with Bachchan lasts throughout their lives and signed off by singing, 'Salamat rahe dostana humara'.
