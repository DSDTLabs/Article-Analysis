HYDERABAD:   police arrested the parents of a seven-year-old girl on the charges of bludgeoning her to death and burying her body under a heap of ash at a brick kiln. 

 
 Urmila Chatriya was the youngest daughter of Hemanth Chatriya and   Chatriya, migrant workers from  , who work at the brick kiln in Yacharam. The couple confessed to have killed the girl as they felt that her disability would be a burden for the family. "While the mother hit the girl on her head with a brick leading to her death, the father buried her body," Yacharam inspector L Krishnam Raju said. 
 
 Urmila was hearing and speech impaired. The couple lodged a complaint with Yacharam police on May 26 that their daughter had gone missing and accordingly, police registered a missing case and alerted nearby police stations about the girl. 
 
 On Tuesday morning, Tulasi, who went to attend nature's call near the brick kiln, created an alibi by shouting loudly that she had a feeling that her daughter was close by and "found" the body buried under the heap of ash. The sniffer dogs brought to the location went to the girl's parents and stopped. When police subjected the couple to sustained interrogation, they spilled the beans.
 
 The couple has three children. The accused have been sent to judicial remand.
