NEW DELHI: The BJP is not happy with a video the   put out on Twitter yesterday that mocked what it calls PM  's " ". 

 
 "Official Twitter account of Congress has shown worst kind of interpretation which does not behove a mature political party," said the BJP, also on Twitter.
 
  
  
 
 The Congress video yesterday ridiculed  's "hugplomacy", or his fondness for giving hugs to heads of state, while on diplomatic visits. This, at a time when a head of state, Israeli PM  , is in town, on a high-profile visit.
 
 That was what particularly galled the BJP. One party leader, Sambit Patra, tweeted saying he "never expected India's main opposition party to post such a tweet ..that too when a respected Foreign PM" is visiting. 
 
  
  
 
 The video highlighted PM Modi's "Titanic hug" with former French President Francois Hollande, the "Let me love you hug" which engulfed Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and the "That's enough hugs" with US President Donald Trump.
 
  
  
 
 The Congress video also called the PM's interactions with female diplomats "awkward", showing footage of his missed handshake with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and his stilted courtesy to Japan's first lady Akie Abe.
 
 PM Modi yesterday broke protocol to receive Israeli counterpart and "close friend" Benjamin Netanyahu on his maiden visit to India. As soon as Netanyahu alighted from the plane, yes, Modi enveloped him in one of his trademark bear hugs. 
 
 An overwhelmed Netanyahu took to Twitter and said: 
 
 "Thank you to my good friend, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who surprised me with a personal welcome at the airport upon my arrival in India. Together we will bring the relations between our countries to new heights!"
