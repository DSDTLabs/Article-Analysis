BENGALURU: Investigation charges towards expenses incurred by   while handling cases were introduced by then DG-IGP   in 2010 to spare cops the burden of bearing the cost out of their  . 

 Eight years later, the monthly investigation charges allocated to each police station remain frozen at Rs 25,000, say police sources, though the cost of everything else has more than doubled in the meantime.
 
  
  
 Handling cases like suicide, murder, rape, gang-rape and kidnapping requires not only sharp thinking and manpower, but also money towards logistics like transportation, senior officials said.
 
  Recently, a man killed his wife and fled to a village in a neighbouring state. The village is around 500km from Bengaluru and a four-member investigating team was assigned the task of nabbing the assailant. Hiring a private cab, the police team, led by a sub-inspector, reached the village after a 10-hour journey, but, by then, the suspect had fled to another village 100km away. 
 
  The team reached the second village and succeeded in arresting the accused. After producing him at a local court, the cops returned to Bengaluru. In three days, they had travelled over 1,200km and had stayed in different hotels. 
 
 "At times, the expenses are huge. We were reimbursed Rs 6 per km, though we paid Rs 12 per km. Often, we spend from our pockets on food and accommodation as the investigation charges have to be kept aside for other cases also," a police officer said.
 
 "While handling suicide and murder cases, we make arrangements to shift bodies to hospitals and mortuaries. We cannot ask family members for money and have to pay from our pockets," said another sub-inspector.
 
 According to police, they need at least Rs 5,000 to handle a case of suicide or murder or unnatural death. "The expense is more where police cremate unidentified bodies. Right from shifting a body for postmortem to taking it to the crematorium, we bear the cost," the officer said.
