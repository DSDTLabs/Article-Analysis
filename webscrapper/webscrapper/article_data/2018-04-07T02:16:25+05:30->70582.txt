NEW DELHI: A 19-year-old man was   with   and   near   on Friday morning. Police said three of his friends have been detained for questioning after the family alleged they had lured the victim, Deepak Chokkar, from their house earlier this week. The body has been sent for an autopsy to ascertain the exact cause of death, police said.

 DCP (south) Romil Baaniya said they received a call at 10am when the victim’s relative spotted the body near the Budh Bazar. A team that reached the spot found the body partially decomposed. They were unable to ascertain if Chokkar was murdered or had fallen off accidentally.
 
 Chokkar’s parents alleged that one of the friends had called him out on the pretext of showing him a new mobile phone after which he went missing. His phone too was switched off. When they tried to contact the friends, their phones too were unreachable. The parents then filed a missing complaint at the Sangam Vihar police station. 
 
 A preliminary inquiry suggests that Chokkar had injuries on head indicating that he fell face down from somewhere. However, cops are yet to confirm if he was pushed or had fallen by himself.
 
 Police officers who had later visited the family claimed that one of the suspects had a fall out with Chokkar as both them drove autorickshaws from a stand near Neb Sarai.
