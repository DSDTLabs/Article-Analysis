Pune: A high-level monitoring committee, which looks after the ecologically sensitive Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani zone, has warned that rampant,   and encroachments are eating away at the popular tourist destinations.

 “We have seen a lot of unauthorized construction in the conservation zone. Besides unauthorized buildings, there are also activities like go-karting and other adventure sports that are operating without permissions. We even observed rampant encroachment on forest land in the area. It’s obvious that such activity, in a zone like the Western Ghats, is bound to damage the ecosystem,” said Ankur Patwardhan, chairman of the monitoring committee.
 
 The committee comprises of ecologists, the Satara district magistrate, and local body members, along with a few other stakeholders, who meet every two months to evaluate the risk to the ecosystem. The centre declared Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani and the surrounding forest areas an eco-sensitive zone in January 2001. 
 
 While the National Green Tribunal prohibited any construction in “forest-like” areas around Mahabaleshwar in 2016, Patwardhan says that land use patterns are being changed rampantly. “It is a different story altogether as to how so many land use patterns are being changed and construction is happening without permission, that too without coming to the notice of the local authorities. We are now trying to train town planning officials and the local body to have a better enforcement mechanism so that illegal construction can be pulled down on notice,” he added.
 
 The spike is also fuelling traffic snarls in the area as highways have been taken up in the boom. “The road leading up to the hill stations is a state highway, where encroachments are prohibited but many structures are coming up along there. Our committee has urged the local trade association and district police to find a solution to the issue,” Patwardhan remarked.
