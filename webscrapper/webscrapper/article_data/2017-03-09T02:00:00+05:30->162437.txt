PATNA: A division bench of Patna   comprising Acting Chief Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice Sudhir Singh on Wednesday asked the state government and Bihar State Housing Board (BSHB) to file a counter affidavit along with a status report within four weeks on flats constructed by them for the common people in last 10 years in Patna.

 The bench passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Mani Bhushan Sengar on July 28 last year. 
 
 “The court has asked the state and BSHB to file a counter affidavit with details of persons to whom flats have been allotted, number of flats in different areas, number of vacant flats, physical status of buildings and flats and status of possession of these flats,” Sengar said.
 
 He added the PIL was based on an RTI petition in which the housing board said 5,268 flats were constructed in Patna from 2005 to 2015 in LIG, MIG and HIG categories from tax payers’ money. “The board also maintained that around 250 flats were reserved for defence personnel and 150 for media personnel in addition to 1,200 flats for rental purpose, but did not provide complete information of all flats following which the PIL was filed,” he said, adding it also came to light that almost all these flats are either half constructed or in a dilapidated condition without ownership. Many flats have also been encroached.
