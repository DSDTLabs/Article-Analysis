PATNA: Even as the doctors suspect that   died following a cardiac arrest, the exact cause behind his sudden collapse in the parking lot of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport on Tuesday afternoon will remain shrouded in mystery.

 The 35-year-old was taken to the Paras-HMRI hospital where he was declared brought dead. . “He felt unconscious in the airport’s parking lot following which our medical team deputed at the airport was called. He was revived and his relatives brought him to the hospital in a private car, but he was declared brought dead,” Paras-HMRI’s medical superintendent Dr Asif   told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 Dr Rahman said the Gurugram-based software engineer’s relatives told doctors that he had medical history of diabetes and hyper-tension. “The exact cause of death could have been ascertained only through postmortem,” he said.
 
 However, autopsy was not conducted since this was not a medico-legal case involving a police complaint. “The family of the deceased could have still asked for postmortem, but they didn’t,” a hospital functionary said.
 
 Rishabh’s family members refused to comment. “We are in bereavement... We cannot talk now,” one relative Ritesh Rastogi told TOI when contacted over the phone on Wednesday.
 
 Sources said Lucknow native   had arrived in Patna from Delhi on Sunday to attend the ‘shraddh’ ceremony of his uncle. Rishabh, his wife and three others of the family had reached the airport on Tuesday to fly back to Delhi by GoAir’s G8-150, when Rishabh collapsed and died.
