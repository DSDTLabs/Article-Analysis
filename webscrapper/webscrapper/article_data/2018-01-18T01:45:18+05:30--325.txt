New Delhi: A day after a 30-year-old woman was found murdered along with her 18-month-old son, the husband of the victim was   while trying to escape from the capital. The accused, Om Prakash, had slept with the bodies overnight and left in the morning. He had first stabbed his sleeping wife Shobha and then killed his son Karan.

 Eight teams had been formed to track Om Prakash (32). His mobile phone was tracked and CCTV footage from the area was scanned to ascertain the route taken by him while fleeing. ISBTs, railway stations, shelter homes and other possible hideouts were raided and his family members and friends were also questioned, DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan said.
 
 Cops got a tip-off from local informers that they had seen the accused going towards Khera Kalan railway station. A team found him there waiting for a train going out of Delhi. He confessed to the crime after his arrest.
 
 Om Prakash told cops that he suspected his wife of having an affair. The couple got married in May 2005, but their relationship soon got rough. Shobha filed a dowry harassment case, but later withdrew it and started living at her maternal place in Haiderpur of northwest Delhi. During this period, the accused started suspecting her of having an illicit relationship with someone and even had doubts whether Karan was his son.
 
 The accused plotted the murder four months ago after suspecting that his wife had got an abortion done. When he confronted her, she denied it and they got into an argument. Om Prakash watched crime series to devise a perfect way to execute the murder and then called Shobha to live with him. She moved back to the G-Block slums in Jahangirpuri last week, police said.
 
 On Tuesday night, Om Prakash committed the murders in front of his other two sons. He then acted as if nothing had happened and told his two sons to go back to sleep. He got up and left the house around 6am. The knife used to commit the crime has been recovered by investigators.
