LUCKNOW: Two personnel of ‘Dial 100’ were suspended after their video   in PCR police   went viral on Wednesday. Head   Ram Bharose and constable Dharmendra Kumar were seen ferrying private passengers in a ‘Dial 100’ van at LRP crossing in Kheri moving towards Sultanpur on Wednesday evening. 

 The video shot by some passersby went viral and led to action by IG Lucknow Zone who ordered immediate suspension of both personnel on Thursday. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 SP Lakhimpur-Kheri Shivasimpi Channappa told TOI that as per preliminary investigations two personnel presented police in poor light by misusing the official vehicle. An enquiry had been set up under ASP (Kheri) to probe the charges while both personnel were suspended with immediate effect. 
 
 He added that whether they took any money for ferrying passengers or not will also be probed and also how long they had been doing this business for. 
 
 After the incident, IG Lucknow Zone A Satish Ganesh instructed all SSP/SPs to issue briefing about guidelines to be followed by the PVR vans deployed in their respective districts so that such incidents do not repeat. The ‘Dial 100’ vans are meant to respond to distress calls and avert mishaps.
