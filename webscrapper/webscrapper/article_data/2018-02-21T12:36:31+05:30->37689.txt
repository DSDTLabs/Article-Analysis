PORVORIM: Opposition members on Tuesday alleged that some ruling MLAs were “purposely wasting time” of the   by dragging their feet over tabling questions.

 Ministers also didn’t give proper replies to questions tabled, the opposition said. “Some ministers give improper replies, while some ruling legislators take more time for supplementary queries. As a result, today, questions on more important issues could not be taken up,” opposition leader   told reporters after Question Hour on Tuesday.
 
 Kavlekar said St Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes’ question regarding functioning of the NRI office was listed fifth. “Fernandes lost a chance to raise his question as not-so-important questions were discussed for a longer time,” he said. The Quepem MLA said the NRI office has been functioning only to the extent of getting the bodies of deceased Goans back to Goa. “The NRI office is of little to no use to those who approach it for any other work,” he alleged.
 
 “St Andre MLA  , had raised an important issue, the need to promote khell tiatrs, but tourism minister   used the opportunity to vent his anger at Pernem MLA Dayanand Sopte,” Kavlekar said. “Already, the session has been shortened and then time is wasted on trivial matters.”
 
 The opposition leader also said such behaviour among ruling MLAs made one suspect whether it was being done deliberately to disallow opposition MLAs from highlighting important issues on the floor of the House or to divert the attention of the House.
 
 Kavlekar said speaker  , ought to bring this matter to the notice of the ruling MLAs and ministers.
 
 Upon being questioned, Kavlekar said though the Congress had demanded that the House be continued as per the schedule, the party could not have its say at the   (BAC) meeting on Monday.
