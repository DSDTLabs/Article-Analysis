NEW DELHI: All hotels, regardless of their star status, will now have to display their ratings prominently at their receptions and on their websites, along with the  's order on hotel classifications. 

  The changes are a part of the ministry of tourism's new guidelines for classification of hotels, which has been done in a bid to streamline and speed up the processes of classification and compliance issues, when they arise. 
 
 While one part of the new guidelines mandate prominent display of star ratings, the government guidelines have also tightened the noose on hotels that house liquor shops on their premises. The guidelines say the ministry will not consider for classification hotels that sell alcohol anywhere other than at their bars. In effect, hotels with liquor shops on their premises will no longer be given star ratings.
