JAMSHEDPUR: The  , a leading   in the  , to make the township the first   in the country, will be completed by the end of 2017-18. 

 The project, started in 2016 and being implemented in a phased manner, aims to reuse 40 million litres of sewerage water every day through recycling to prevent the discharge of waste water into water bodies. 
 
 "After the completion of the first phase earlier this year, we are reusing 10 million litres of waste water every day at our western water recycling plant (in Bistupur) while the technical upgradation and engineering automation work at the eastern plant (in Bara Agrico) is under way to make it effective to treat 30 million litres of sewerage water every day," said divisional manager, corporate communications, Jusco, Rajesh Rajan. 
 
 The two water treatment plants are meant for removing dissolved solids and other wastes from sewerage water and readying the distilled water for further use. Along with the engineering upgradation work, Jusco is also installing packaged sewage treatment plants (PSTP) in different localities for recycling the sewerage water at the generation site itself.
