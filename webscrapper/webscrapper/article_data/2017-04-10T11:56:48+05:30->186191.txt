THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   state secretary   has stressed the need for the party to transform itself into a “militant party” in order to regain the   it has lost in recent years.

 Inaugurating a one-day district leadership camp of the party here on Sunday, he called upon party leaders to make the CPI visible at the grass-root level by revitalising local branches.
 
 “Beyond the local committees, the leadership has been ignoring party branches, thus failing to reach out to people or take up public issues. The CPI should transform itself into a ‘militant party’ which can effectively intervene in people’s issues and lead mass agitations,” he said.
 
 Though the CPI has taken correct political stands on various issues, it is lacking in organizational capabilities to take them to the masses, Rajendran said. “The party is in the process of preparing an action plan which will help give clarity on party’s ways of functioning and on a code of conduct to be followed by leaders and workers,” he added.
 
 The   also stressed the need to attain the political strength required to fight governments that follow undemocratic and autocratic policies.
