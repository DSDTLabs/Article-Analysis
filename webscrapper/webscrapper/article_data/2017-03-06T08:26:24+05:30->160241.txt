VADODARA: Bhilistan Tiger Sena (BTS), a tribal outfit led by prominent leader  , will embark on a 13-day ‘tribal constitutional rights’ yatra from Umargam in south Gujarat to voice their demands and grievances. 

 Vasava, who is also the state president of Janta Dal (United) told media persons here on Sunday that the yatra is aimed at highlighting the plight of tribals. “The problems of our people have gone unheard. Widows and young girls in the tribal belt are being exploited and forced into human trafficking. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should solve such problems of our people first instead of inaugurating bridges,” Vasava said, slamming the PM. 
 
 Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the new four-lane bridge over Narmada in Bharuch on March 7.
 
 Vasava said that the yatra would cover the entire eastern belt of the state and end at Waghodia on April 26.
 
 Asked if he would make representations to Modi when he comes for the bridge inauguration, Vasava said, “Intelligence bureau does not allow anyone to meet the Prime Minister. It is as if IB is ruling the country and not Modi.”
 
 Vasava also suggested that the   (EC) should introduce reservations in political parties too and added that their demand for a separate Bhilistan state for tribals will also be raised during the yatra.
