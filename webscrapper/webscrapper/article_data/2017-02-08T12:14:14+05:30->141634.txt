To justify her stand against Anjali, Saroj shows her a video where Anjali is seen ill-treating his father. Anjali tries to justify herself but in vain. Vikram is furious at her and slaps her in front of everyone.

 While Simar feels defeated, Prem consoles her. He tells her she should feel happy that she managed to change Anjali for the better. Maataji is still hopeful of making things work between Vikram and Anjali. 
 
 Anjali goes to Vikram to explain her actions, but he remains adamant and refuses to listen to her. When he shoves Anjali's hand and pushes her aside, her ‘mangalsutra’ breaks. Anjali begins to collect the beads and goes to the temple to seek light on how to get her love back. 
 
 
 
 Piyush comes to talk to Vikram. However, Vikram cites Roshni's example to tell him how trust once lost cannot be regained easily. This makes Piyush turn silent. 
 
 On the other hand, Tao Ji threatens to expose Saroj's act of getting Anjali attacked by goons. She retorts by saying that she'd kill herself if he does that.
