AHMEDABAD: A special   court on Saturday finished hearing arguments by lawyers representing two Central   officials, who have challenged the court summons to them on the basis of the supplementary chargesheet the CBI filed four years ago.

 Four IB officials, then special director  , his subordinates Rajeev Wankhede, T S Mittal and M K Sinha, were charged by the CBI with murder and conspiracy in February 2014. However, the magisterial court did not taken cognizance of the chargesheet because the probe agency did not get sanction from the Centre to criminally prosecute these IB officials. The IB officials were charge-sheeted separately from seven Gujarat cops including P P Pandey, who was discharged from the case last month.
 
 Last year, the Centre refused permission for criminal prosecution. However, a CBI court issued summons to the four officials thereby taking cognizance of the chargesheet. Two officers – Wankhede and Mittal – challenged the summons. Their advocates submitted on Saturday that the court could not have taken cognizance of the chargesheet after the government refused sanction for criminal prosecution.
 
 The CBI insisted that the supplementary chargesheet was filed against five persons. There were charges levelled against one Gujarat cop too. There is no provision to file separate chargesheets against different accused persons. If the court takes cognizance of charges against one person it is not within the court’s jurisdiction to reject charges another accused, said CBI counsel R C Kodekar.
 
 Special CBI judge J K Pandya posted further proceedings on this issue for March 31.
 
 Meanwhile, the CBI court issued notice to the investigating agency seeking its reply to accused D G Vanzara’s application requesting discharge from the case.
