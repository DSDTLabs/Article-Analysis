Mumbai: Over a fortnight after two A320s did a precautionary landing after they were hit by technical snags, another aircraft from the old fleet was grounded on Monday. 

 The A320 aircraft was en route from Mumbai to Kochi when it encountered a problem with the cabin pressure and the aircraft had to be diverted to Mangalore where it carried out an emergency landing. 
 
 The A320 classics are over 20 years old and they were termed “snag-prone’’ by the AI pilots two years ago. Though the pilots had demanded that these aircraft be grounded, they continue to operate flights within the country.   flight 681 with 50 passengers on board encountered a technical problem, which had the oxygen masks drop from the overhead panel. 
 
 Aircraft that fly over 14,000 ft have conditioned air circulated throughout the passenger cabin to keep the temperature and pressure at comfortable levels. 
 
 Oxygen masks automatically drop when the system develops a problem and there is a loss of cabin pressurization. But masks could also drop if the overhead panels in which they are stored are loose or worn out. An Air India spokesperson confirmed the diversion and attributed it to a technical snag. He added that the passengers stranded in Mangalore were flown to their destination airport Kochi on board a Mumbai-Chennai flight, which took a detour to accommodate them. The A320 is currently grounded in Mangalore and will be flown to Delhi on Thursday as a ferry flight to carry out repairs. Monday’s incident involving the A320 classic comes barely 3 weeks after two other incidents involving the same aircraft type. On February 11, two AI pilots flying on the Mumbai-Jodhpur-Jaipur-Mumbai route were forced to return and make precautionary landings twice within a span on seven hours as wheels of two A320 classic aircraft failed to retract post take-off.
