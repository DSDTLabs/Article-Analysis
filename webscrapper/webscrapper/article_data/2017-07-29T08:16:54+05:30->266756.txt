HYDERABAD: The issue of hike in school fees seems to take an ugly turn as parents on Friday decided to protest against the delay in submission of a report on this by the Tirupathi Rao committee. 

 The panel, which was tasked with working on a formula to regulate school fees, sought an extension of 45 days to submit its report, and that has angered many parents' associations. 
 
 The extension was sought by the committee on July 7. The report is supposed to be submitted by August 22.
 
 Parents have now decided to up their ante against the state government with massive protests in the city. 
 
 "We will soon issue a letter to the committee and the state government over this delay. If we fail to receive a satisfactory response, we shall boycott the report that will be submitted by the committee," said   Naredi, executive member of the Hyderabad School Parents' Association (HSPA).
 
 This is not the first time that the committee has sought an extension. The Tirupathi Rao committee was expected to submit its report on May 27, before the commencement of the academic year. While the report was finalised by May 29, the same was not submitted citing legal concerns. 
 
 With further delay caused by the panel, parents are worried that the law to regulate the fee structure in private schools in the city may not be implemented until the next academic year. 
 
 "Initially, the committee members claimed that they wanted to study the   and   model of school fee regulation. Later, they reasoned that they were collecting details from all schools. The uncertainty continues as we have no clue as to when the rules will be framed," said Aravinda Jata, member of HSPA. 
 
 It may be recalled here that parents had held a massive protest rally earlier this month against the   government's failure in capping the school fee hike in the state of Telangana. 
 
 Over 200 people had gathered in front of the office of the commissioner and director of school education department in Saifabad.
