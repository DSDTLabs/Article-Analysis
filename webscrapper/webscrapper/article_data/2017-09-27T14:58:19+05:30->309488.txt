MUMBAI: Four friends killed a 17-year-old boy by   at his home in Bandra (East) in the early hours of Tuesday and fled with gold ornaments. 

 The four school dropouts—main accused Niyaz Hashmi (19), and Saddam Shoukat Ali (19), Shahzad Ali (20) and Saddam Shaikh (18)—were arrested by   within eight hours. 
 
 The murder in a slum at   came to light when Ajay Jaiswal’s parents returned from their home town around 7am. “After killing Ajay, the accused locked the door from outside and left. So when Ajay’s parents returned, they searched for him for some time. Finally, they broke the lock and entered their house only to find him lying in a pool of blood,” police said.
 
 After Ajay’s sister, who lives nearby, told police he was with the four friends on Monday night, DCP (zone VIII) Anil Kumbhare formed a special team to nab them. “They were picked from different locations in Bandra and Powai,” said senior inspector Rajendra Patil. 
 
 Police said when the four friends reached Ajay’s home, they planned to kill him and take away whatever valuables they could get. “Hashmi, a drug addict, had told his friends about his intention to kill Ajay earlier,” police said adding that Hashmi slit Jaiswal’s throat after his accomplices overpowered him.
