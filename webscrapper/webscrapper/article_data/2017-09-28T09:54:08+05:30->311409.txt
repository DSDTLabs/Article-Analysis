SHIMLA: With the announcement of assembly elections expected anytime, it's raining projects in Himachal Pradesh. If chief minister   is on a foundation stone laying spree, the Union government is not too far behind in sanctioning projects for the state.

 After deciding to lay the foundation stone of All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( ) at Kothipura in Bilaspur district on October 3, the Centre has now cleared 221 proposals of roads and bridges worth Rs 782.24 crore under   (PMGSY) for the state.
 
 A spokesperson of the public works department said the Union ministry of rural development had cleared these proposals. He said that as per the revised funding pattern for Himalayan states, the ratio of Centre and state share will be 90:10 and that out of the Rs 782.24 crore sanctioned, Centre's share will be Rs 697.86 crore and state's Rs 84.37 crore.
 
 Terming it as a gift from the Centre,  's Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur said this initiative would certainly go a long way in providing reliable and quicker access to services, information and social linkages. 
 
 He claimed that ever since PM   came to power in the Centre, he had bestowed Himachal Pradesh with various developmental projects, be it  ,   or medical enhancements for the state.
 
 "But the incapable Congress-led state government has failed to utilize the development (projects). It is owing to its incompetency and disinterest that the state is reeling under major debts," he added.
