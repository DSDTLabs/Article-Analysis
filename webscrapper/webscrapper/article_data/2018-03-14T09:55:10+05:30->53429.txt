NEW DELHI: A day after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred lenedrs from issuing Letters of Understanding (LoUs),   took a hit in the equity market, causing the benchmark indices to lose almost half a per cent in morning trade.

 
 30-share BSE   lost 123.23 points to start trading at 33,733.55 while the broader 50-share NSE   slipped 33.80 points to open at 10,393.05.
 
 On Tuesday, RBI issued the directive on LoUs and LoCs (Letters of Comfort), about a month after it was discovered that diamond merchants Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi had misused LoUs issued by PNB to defraud the bank of over $2 billion. As an after effect, bank stocks were under pressure on Wednesday morning with the Nifty PSU Bank sub-index tanking almost 2 per cent in the initial half hour of trading. SBI, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank were all losing in the tune of 1 per cent each. PNB fraud-embroiled Gitanjali Gems was down a further 5 per cent.
