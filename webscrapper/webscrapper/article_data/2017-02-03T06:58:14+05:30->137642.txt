KOLKATA: Sixteen years after a murder that made national headlines,   has finally solved the case by arresting a  ,  . 

 Police said that Nawaz E Wadia — the secretary to the ICI managing director and a resident of Chowringhee — was shot dead in broad daylight on June 29, 2001 near the CTC headquarters. 
 
 Police came to know about the murder when the Beniapukur cops and the homicide section of the detective department nabbed Sarfuddin (32) in connection with some shooting cases in and around the Park Circus-Beniapukur area on January 19. 
 
 “When we started questioning Sarfuddin in connection with a shooting, he revealed that he had procured the gun from Md Mohid alias Moij alias Motor, a resident of Begusarai in Bihar,” said additional CP (crime) Vishal Garg.
 
 The cops set up a trap and picked Mohid from Bihar on Wednesday.
 
 “He admitted before us that it was he, who had offered Sarfu a supari of Rs 50,000 in 2001,” said DC (ESD) Debasmita Das.
 
  According to cops, since Wadia (46) used to live alone, she had asked her help Cartherina Kindo to stay with her. Over time, the victim accepted Kindo as her daughter and bestowed a fortune worth lakhs on her. Her help Kindo was married to Mohid, who ran a small-time chappal business and was finding his way into the world of arms smuggling. When Mohid came to know about this, he planned to murder Wadia. 
 
 Interestingly, Sarfu was once arrested eight years ago but investigators found no link with this murder. “Sarfu has several attempt to murder cases against him. But this is his first case of murder against him. But he has to be tried as a juvenile as he was not 18 while committing the crime ,” said police.
