TIRUPUR: Opposition party members on Tuesday petitioned the district superintendent of police, E S  , seeking action against Paramasamy, who was reappointed as   deputy superintendent of police 15 days after he was transferred to   district crime branch, saying the sale of banned lotteries from Kerala, rooster fights, illegal liquor sale and other police excesses had increased in Avinashi and its surrounding villages during his tenure.

 The members of DMK, Congress, CPM, CPI, VCK, MDMK, DMDK, TMC and PMK had recently passed a resolution seeking action against him. They also raised suspicion over his reappointment as   within 15 days after he was transferred to Salem district crime branch.
 
 “Illegal activities have increased in Avinashi and its surrounding villages. Earlier, we never heard about rooster fight practices in the region. But now, it is encouraged,” said S Venkatachalam, CPM Avinashi union secretary.
 
 They also pointed out that cases related to road traffic rules have come down as per official record, while actually such cases were on the rise. “Erring motorists escape with paying bribe. The sale of liquor in Tasmac shops, bars and recreation clubs is not controlled at all. Such illegal activities are allowed by accepting bribes. If mobile phone call lists of police personnel were verified, the truth will come out,” said a social worker, requesting anonymity.
 
 DSP Paramasamy was appointed deputy superintendent of police, Avinashi, in August 2016. He was transferred to district crime branch in the first week of February, 2018. But on February 17, he was brought back to Avinashi range again.
 
 Refuting all charges, Paramasamy told TOI, “Some of these political functionaries have a hidden agenda and they have developed grudge against me for taking tough action in people oriented issues.”
