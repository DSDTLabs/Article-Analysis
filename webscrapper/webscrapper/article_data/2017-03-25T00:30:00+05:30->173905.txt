Bengaluru: A 22-year-old computer science student was stabbed to death by his hostel roommate after he asked the latter to flush the toilet. The incident happened at Deveraja Urs hostel in Anjananagar, off Magadi Road, in Ramanagara district.

 Rohit Channappa was a sixth semester computer science student of East West College in Byadarahalli and a resident of Solur near Nelamangala. He shared the room with Ravish NR, 21, a third-year BA student at the Vijayanagar government college, and another student. 
 
 “Rohit was a teetotaler and always advised Ravish against smoking and drinking. On Thursday night, Ravish returned to the hostel around 9pm in a inebriated condition,” police said. He used the toilet in the room and slept without flushing it or closing the door. “Upset over the stench, Rohit shouted at Ravish, asking him to flush the toilet or at least close the door. A furious Raviesh pulled out a knife and stabbed Rohit in the stomach,” police said. 
 
 The third roommate, Amareshappa, tried to intervene but Ravish attacked him too. Amareshappa ran out with an injured hand and alerted the others. “By the time the other inmates rushed to the spot, Rohit was lying in pool of blood and Ravish was missing. Rohit died en route to hospital and we arrested Ravish on Friday morning,” police added.
