AURANGABAD: Three Marathwada districts and   have been receiving their supply of drinking water through tankers even though summer is yet to begin.
 
 Official data shows about 114 villages and hamlets in region have been reeling under water scarcity, prompting authorities to press into service an alternative arrangement.
 
 Over 138 water tankers have been deployed in parts of Marathwada, with Aurangabad district getting the most, at 120 tankers.   (11),   (6) and   (1) are other districts getting tanker water-.While Beed, Hingoli, Osmanabad and   are yet to call for water tankers, but the possibility of their doing so cannot be ruled out in the near future, authorities said.
 
 Revenue department officials said on Sunday that several villages in  , Phulambri and Sillod talukas of Aurangabad district have become dependent on tankers for drinking water needs. “Water storage has not increased because of unsatisfactory rainfall in parts of Aurangabad last monsoon. In fact, poor run of monsoon over the years has had a cumulative effect, leading to scarcity of drinking water,” authorities said.
 
 Latest official reports show seven of nine Aurangabad talukas are supplied with water tankers, with Gangapur leading, being supplied by 52 tankers, followed by Phulambri (30), Sillod (21), Aurangabad (6), Vaijapur, Kannad (4 each) and Khultabad (3). In all, 96 villages and hamlets from Aurangabad have become dependent on tankers.
 
 In both Jalna and Nanded districts, eight villages have been receiving drinking water through tankers respectively, as is a village from Parbhani.
 
 “We expect the demand for water tankers to further increase in the days to come, especially during summer. We periodically review water scarcity, if any, across the eight districts of Marathwada,” revenue department officials said.
