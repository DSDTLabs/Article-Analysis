NEW DELHI: South corporation has collected around Rs 17.5 crore as conversion charge after establishments at   market were sealed on December 22 last year.

 The previous rate was Rs 89,000, which had been cut down to Rs 22,274 for a trader who had to also file an affidavit agreeing to pay whatever final amount was fixed by  . The biggest amounts have been recovered from traders in central zone that covers Greater Kailash, Lajpat Nagar, Defence Colony area, followed by south zone where Hauz Khas market, Chhatarpur and Vasant Vihar lie.
 
 “Rs 4.66 crore has been deposited in west zone, Rs 5.72 crore in south zone, Rs 6.18 crore from central zone and Rs 91 lakh from Najafgarh since December 22,” an official said. But the recovery could have been much larger if the confusion regarding the deposit deadline hadn’t been there.
 
 Manmohan Singh, general secretary of Hauz Khas market traders’ association, said many traders have deposited the new rate but an atmosphere of confusion still prevails. “UD ministry has given a window of June 30, but as per the committee, it is till January 15. Should we trust gazette notification by the government or committee?” Singh said.
 
 Rajender   who heads market association in GK1 M Block said traders have not yet deposited under the new rate. “We had already filed conversion charge at the rate of Rs 6,200 per square metre in 2010,” Sharda said.
 
 Mayor   said, “The amount deposited has bee due to our counselling, and we are hoping that the deadline will be extended to June 30 at least,” she said.
