LUCKNOW: Claiming that democracy, social fabric and constitutional institutions were under severe threat under   government, Nationalist Congress Party ( ) national general secretary   said that a grand alliance of anti-BJP parties has already been formed to dislodge the NDA government from Centre in 2019 elections. 

 "Under Modi government, democracy, constitutional institutions including the   and social fabric are severely under threat," said Tripathi at a press conference in the state capital on Thursday.

 Taking note of distress among farmers, youth, minorities, Dalits and public, the opposition has developed a consensus to defeat BJP in 2019 general elections, he claimed. Asked who would be the face of the proposed front, Tripathi said that any able and experienced leader would be elected to lead after elections.

 The NCP leader said that for the first time in history, Supreme Court judges had to come out in public with their complaints and the apex court's credibility was at the lowest in present regime. He said that his party had supported the move for impeachment of CJI.
