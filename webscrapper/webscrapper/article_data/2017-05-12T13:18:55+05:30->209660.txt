Filmmaker Chandra Mohan’s directorial debut ‘Radha’ hit the screens on May 12. The much-awaited film has   essaying the titular character of a cop who has his own way of tackling the goons. The film also stars  , Aksha Pardhasany, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Ashish Vidyarthi,Tanikella Bharani,   and Shakalaka Shankar in prominent roles. As shown in the trailer, the plot appears to be a light-hearted comedy in the first half with some intense political undertones.

 Radha Krishna (Sharwanand) is smitten by Lord Krishna's teachings and grows up to become a police believing that the God had come in the avatar of a cop to help him during his childhood.
 
 With his intolerance towards criminals Radha Krishna wins a recommendation for a sub-inspector’s post by the DGP. He is posted at a village where there is no crime at all and eventually meets Radha (Lavanya Tripathi) and falls for her. 
 
 Meanwhile, a major political party headed by Kota Srinivasa Rao is looking for candidates for the chief minister’s post. Sujatha (Ravi Kishan) and Ashish Vidyarthi, who is already the home minister, are in the race for the post. The tale takes a turn when a bomb blast rocks a meeting where Sujatha was delivering a lecture.
 
 The chemistry between the lead pair disappoints a bit. However, until the first half, the movie is an average fair and hopefully will draw you back to your seats for a power-packed second half.
