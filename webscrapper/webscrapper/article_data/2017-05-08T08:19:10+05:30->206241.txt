NAGPUR The number of tigers in Maharashtra's   has increased to 44 this year, as compared to 31 in 2016. 

 The increase of 13 tigers was recorded in East Pench ( ), Chorbahuli, Saleghat and Deolapar areas of Mansinghdeo sanctuary, and Paoni and Nagalwadi. Officials said that of the 44 tigers recorded, 22 are males and 22 females. "An official report is still being finalised. But, yes, the number of tigers has gone up to 44 in the 660 sq km area where the estimation was done. This number doesn't include cubs, which are around 7-8," said Pench chief conservator of forests ( ) and field director Rishikesh Ranjan. 
 
 As per National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines, the Phase IV annual estimation exercise with camera traps was conducted jointly by   (WCT) and   over 21 days in January 2017.
 
 The figure of 44 also includes a couple of tigers that have died since the January exercise in and around Pench. Since January this year, Pench has lost four tigers, of which two died in territorial fights. "Even though a couple of tiger deaths were not considered, increasing tiger numbers is also vindicated by death of tigers in territorial fights. It shows that growing Pench tiger population is crying for space," officials said.
 
 Even as the death toll of tigers in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has gone up to 42 in last 14 months, steady increase in tiger numbers in   is an achievement for wildlife wing and NGOs working in and around Pench.
 
 Officials said five adults have been sharing common territory on the MP and Maharashtra border of Pench. However, during the exercise these tigers were recorded in Maharashtra Pench.
 
 Wildlife conservationists attributed Pench success to former field director MS Reddy, who took over Pench when the number of tigers was 19. Reddy said, "I have not seen the report but yes, team work has yielded desired results."
