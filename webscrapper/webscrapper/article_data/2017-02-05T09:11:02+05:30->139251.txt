BHOPAL: The state economic offences (EOW) wing issued a notice to   authorities recently seeking a detailed report and documents related to international conference on stem cell. The   launched a probe into allegations of irregularities against former registrar Lonu Singh Solanki. The conference was organised in 2015 on   campus, which was permitted by vice-chancellor Prof MD Tiwari. 

 The higher education department has sent a letter to BU registrar UN Shukla to provide report about the then registrar Solanki. Solanki is currently registrar at Chhtarasal University, Chhatarpur. According to a complaint lodged with EOW, the complainant claimed that an account in the name of the then registrar Solanki was opened in a nationalised bank for the conference. Solanki had not informed about the account to the   controller of the university. 
 
 The complainant, Rakesh Bihari Sharma, alleged that payment for conference was made without seeking approval of finance controller of the university. Around Rs 7 lakh were paid for the conference.
 
 Sharma alleged that experts invited for lectures were not from the field of stem cell engineering. Around Rs 5 lakh were paid for their visit. Besides, an additional amount of Rs 3 lakh was paid to a faculty, who was a controversial figure. The complainant claimed that majority of experts who visited Bhopal in fact came to meet their relatives. The BU paid for what was shown as official visit. 
 
 Besides, Rs 34 lakh was spent on the conference that includes travel, lodging, printing and others. The audit department of the university raised objections last year over irregularities, drawing the attention of registrar Solanki and Prof Tiwari.
