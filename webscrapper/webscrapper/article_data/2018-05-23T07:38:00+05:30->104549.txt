Ludhiana: A week after a part of Gill Flyover was closed following the collapse of its retaining wall, traffic chaos reigns on Gill Road, at Dashmesh Nagar, Dana Mandi and Shimlapuri, among other adjoining areas. The regular snarl-ups have left the businessmen, who take the stretch to reach their factories, sore. 

 Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings, said, “The closure of flyover is impacting more than 75% of the industrialists, as they either have their units in the areas around Gill Road, like Industrial Area, Dashmesh Nagar, Partap Nagar, Shimlapuri, or in Focal Point, Dhandari and Sahnewal. Gill Flyover is a key access road to their factories.”
 
 The businessmen were taking at least 30 minutes to an hour more to reach their factories through alternative routes, which too were facing bottlenecks. “The issue must be solved at the earliest. The authorities should work out a traffic plan till the flyover is repaired. Either heavy vehicles should be banned on Gill Road from 10am to 5pm or they be told to ply on a separate lane,” he added. 
 
 Inderjit Singh Navyug, president of United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “Gill Road has the largest industrial products market in the state. The closure of the flyover has hit business. It is also leading to wastage of time and lakhs of rupees on fuel due to traffic jams, especially near Arora Palace, Bhagwan Chowk and UCPMA chowk. The repair work should be completed on priority or the side of flyover from Dholewal chowk be opened for four-wheelers. This will decongest Gill Road.”
