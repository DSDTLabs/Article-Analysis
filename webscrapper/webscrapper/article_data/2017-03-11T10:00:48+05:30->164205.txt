MUMBAI: “Acchhe din” seems to have begun for blind cricket in India. It's learnt that in a first of its kind gesture on its part, the   ( ) will award Rs 1 crore to the Indian cricket team which won the T20 blind cricket World Cup last month by beating arch-rivals Pakistan by nine wickets in the final in Bangalore.

 The decision was taken in a meeting of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (COA) on February 25 in Mumbai. The four-member COA is headed by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India Vinod Rai, and includes famous cricket historian  , Vikram Limaye, managing director of Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) and former Indian women's cricket captain Diana Edulji. The prize money will be given to   (CABI), which will subsequently pass it onto its players.
 
 Blind cricketers in India face a perennial struggle to continue playing the sport for financial reasons, and many players of the World Cup-winning team were forced by their employers to play in the tournament on a “leave without pay” basis. This move will be a shot in the arm for blind cricket in India.
 
 “It's a fabulous gesture. It's not the money that matters, but the recognition,” said Patrick Rajkumar, coach of the team, told TOI on Friday.
 
 “Getting this kind of announcement and commitment from BCCI means a lot to us. My heartfelt thanks to the new team to have taken this decision. We took loans to organise the World Cup,” a grateful CABI president GK Mahantesh stated.
