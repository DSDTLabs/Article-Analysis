TRICHY: Rainfall accompanied by heavy thunderstorms and wind lashed the city on Wednesday offering respite to the people from the sweltering heat.

 Though several regions in the district including villages on the outskirts of   experienced rainfall a few days ago, only over the past 36 hours did the city witness rainfall – after slight drizzle on Tuesday night. The city also received good rainfall the next afternoon.
 
 The rainfall, which began on Wednesday afternoon, extended for two hours and 45 minutes. Meteorological observatory recorded 75mm rainfall at Trichy airport alone. Meteorologist S Devadoss said that there is a possibility of rainfall in the forthcoming days. “Before the onset of south-west monsoon, which is expected to be by the first week of June, there are chances that Trichy might experience moderate rainfall in the next few days,” he told TOI.
 
 The rainfall also caused a heavy   jam in several spots in the city – particularly at Bharathidasan Salai and Lawson’s Road where vehicles were stuck at the flooded roads. Apart from this, a government bus was stuck in a flooded subway at Melapudur for a few hours as it had half sunk in the water and caused a traffic jam in that area too.
