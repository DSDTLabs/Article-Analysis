GREATER NOIDA: Two of the accused in the   murder case will move court on Monday seeking a day’s parole to enable them to meet their ailing grandfather, residents of Bisada have said.

 Ajit Singh, grandfather of Gaurav and Saurav, suffered a heart attack on March 29 and was admitted to Kailash Hospital in Sector 27, Noida.
 
 A spokesperson for the hospital has confirmed that Ajit Singh is currently on a ventilator.
 
 Sanjay Rana, the father of one of the 18 accused in the case, said the family of Gaurav and Saurav would move court on Monday to seek a day’s parole for the boys so they can meet their grandfather.
 
 The boys’ father, Dheeraj Singh, had tried to apply for parole on Friday but couldn’t because of the strike by the lawyers at the district court in Surajpur, Rana said.
 
 “We will now try to apply for a day’s parole for the boys on Monday when the court reopens,” Hariom Singh, husband of village pradhan Kaushalya Devi, said.
 
 Meanwhile, the families of the   murder accused met on Saturday and decided that the villagers would hand over a memorandum to newly elected MLA Tejpal Nagar of BJP, seeking his “help in ensuring the arrest of Jaan Mohammed”, brother of Mohammad Akhlaq, who was attacked by a local mob over allegations of slaughtering a cow and storing its meat for consumption in September 2015.
 
 An FIR citing the charge of cow slaughter was registered against Akhlaq and six family members following a court order on July 14, 2016, under the Cow Protection Act, 1955.
 
 Akhlaq had succumbed to his injuries on September 28, 2015, when the attack took place while his son Danish survived with a fractured skull. Eighteen people, including three juveniles were arrested on charges of murder and assault.
 
 The accused persons had sought a case of cow slaughter against Akhlaq’s family citing the forensic report on the meat recovered from Akhlaq’s fridge.
