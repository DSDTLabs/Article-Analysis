KERI: The Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary of Sattari is again in the news for the presence of almost five tigers in it. The camera trap technology used by the forest officials of wildlife division took pictures of five different tigers.

 This time the authorities, with the help of trekkers, put the camera trap in areas where tiger movements were most likely. After working for many days and nights, they were successful in getting the pictures of one male, two females and two cubs.
 
 Principal chief conservator of forests Ajay Saxena told TOI, “We have put our best efforts to monitor the tiger movements in the Mhadei sanctuary. This area is not easily accessible and has tough geographical terrain and using camera trap techniques was a big challenge. We had planned our strategy to protect and conserve the tigers.”
 
 Vitthal Shelke, an activist with   in Sattari said, “There is no doubt that tigers moving in the Mhadei region are residents, since repeated camera trap pictures have indicated that the area is a favourable natural habitat for the big cats”. 
 
 “This Sanctuary has the presence of good number of ungulate population and the forested areas free from human population have the availability of proper food and water required for supporting tigers,” Shelke added. 
 
 When Richard D’souza was principal chief conservator of forests, he successfully convinced then chief minister   of using the camera trap techniques to confirm the presence of the tiger. 
 
 In April 2013, range forest officer   achieved success in getting pictures of tigress in the Mhadei Sanctuary, which was again confirmed by well-known zoologist Ullahas Karanth, through the camera trap.
