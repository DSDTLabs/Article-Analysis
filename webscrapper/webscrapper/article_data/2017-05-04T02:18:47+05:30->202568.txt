MUMBAI: The   (ED) on Wednesday opposed the bail plea of  , a close aide of   (IRF) founder  , on the grounds that the investigation is not complete. 

 The ED said further investigations are on to identify other proceeds of crime and efforts were on to locate Naik and his other associates. Gazdar was arrested for his alleged involvement in a money-laundering case. The special judge adjourned the bail hearing to May 15.
 
 Gazdar, in his bail plea, had claimed that the ED has completed its investigation against him and hence, his continued custody is unwarranted. Gazdar, who trades in marble and granites and is a director on six companies floated by Naik, has been behind bars at Arthur Road jail for three months. 
 
 But ED counsel H S Venegaonkar argued that the investigation into the case against Naik and other suspected persons is still on. The ED’s reply by its assistant director Prakash Poojari relied on Supreme Court rulings to point to the “deleterious impact on the national economy and heinous nature of an economic offence” as a prime reason why bail should be refused. The ED stressed that the the probe against Naik in a case lodged by the NIA last November is still pending, and the Indian government, on November 17, 2016, had declared IRF an unlawful association under the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. 
 
 The ED claimed Gazdar is a “close confidant” of Naik as he played an active role in laundering his money. “His release may severely hamper the probes under the Prevention of   Act (PMLA) and even NIA, as he is aware of the line of investigation,” said the ED, also citing other reasons to oppose the bail, including that he may tamper with evidence or tip off the other accused. Last month, the ED had submitted its complaint against Gazdar under Sections 3 and 4 of the PMLA, which attracts a maximum seven years in jail and a fine up to Rs 5 lakh.
