THANE: The   has granted   to   corporator   who has been accused of threatening and making extortion demands to a ready-mix contractor. The corporator, however, refutes these allegations and claimed that he is innocent and has been framed. 

 "A team of police officials came to my house on Thursday night and were extremely violent and unnecessarily aggressive. They kicked and banged on my door. I repeatedly requested them to state the reason for such unruly behaviour, but they refused to comment. However, the next day they police filed a false case of extortion against me,'' the Sena corporator said.
 
 He added, "I have all the   footage of the incidents and there were several people who have witnessed this. I will answer everything in court now." The Sena corporator was booked by the   police for extortion, following a complaint by a civil works contractor dealing with ready-mix material who said that Bhoir had summoned him to his office on April 24 and had demanded that he pay protection money of Rs 250 per sq m for his project. 
 
 Bhoir was absconding after the police had registered a case against him on March 31. Senior inspector of Kapurbawdi police station B T Barawkar said, "Bhoir has secured interim relief till April 11 and the probe is underway."
