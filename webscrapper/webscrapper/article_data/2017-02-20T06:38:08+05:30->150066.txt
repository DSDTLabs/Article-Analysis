NASHIK: Do not fret if you do not find your name in the voters’ list on Tuesday as the civic body has launched an   search facility for the same.

 The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has launched two websites - http://nmcvotersearch.co.in/ and www.nashikcorporation.in, where voters can check for their names along with the address of their polling booth.
 
 Voters will be able to find their names on the   with the help of their ward or prabhag number. 
 
 The civic body has launched these sites after the state election commission said that the voters list published on their official website was inaccessible. So, an online search facility has been introduced by the NMC to help voters find their names.
 
 The search has been made even easier by the NMC, as they have also launched a mobile application – ‘Smart Nashik’, which voters can download on their smartphones from the Google playstore. They can search for their name either alphabetically or their election card number.
 
 Shifting gears for voting awareness: The NMC, Nashik Citizens Forum (NCF) and Kavita Raut Foundation jointly organized a motorcycle rally here to encourage citizens to vote for the civic polls, being held on February 21 and increase the voting percentage.
 
 Starting from Mahatma Nagar cricket ground, the rally went via Bhosla Military Square, College Road, Canada Corner, CBS, Ashoka Stambh, Raviwar Karanja, Gadkari Square, ABB Circle and finally ended at Mahatma Nagar ground.
