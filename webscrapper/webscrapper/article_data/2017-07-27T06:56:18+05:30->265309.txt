HYDERABAD:While the drug menace in the city is wide-spread, Hyderabad has only one rehabilitation centre in the government sector – at the Institute of   But this too caters largely to   

 While there are a handful of private centres as well, offering de-addiction services, they are often too expensive. The monthly charges at these centres range anywhere between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh. What makes it worse is that there is no guarantee how long the entire de-addiction process may take. 
 
 Though de-addiction medicines aren’t very expensive, those in the know of things say that these private centres charge heavily for accommodation and other facilities. “Also the few de-addiction centres operating in the city do not have necessary permissions from the state health authorities and thereby charge at will. They are currently unregulated,” said Dr  , superintendent, IMH. Speaking about the government centre, he said: “At our centre, most of the people seek alcohol de-addiction. One in 20 patients at times is a drug addict” 
 
 Given the dearth of de-addiction and rehabilitation centres, experts say how those suffering from drug addiction are often admitted as in-patients and treated with glucose and other sugar-filled drugs which lower their anxiety levels, albeit temporarily. 
 
 “However once the patient comes out of the hospital, the urge to go back to drugs shoots up again. The problem here is thatusers have an underlying reason due to which they turn to drugs -- it could be anxiety, depression or low self-esteem. Unless the underlying reason is also treated, treatment is difficult,” said Dr  , consultant psychopathologist, Yashoda Hospital.
