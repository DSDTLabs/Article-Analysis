Kolhapur: The KMC standing committee chairman Ashish Dhawale on Friday directed the officials to remove the encroachments in Gadi Adda area near Venus Corner within a month.

 The land is reserved for development of parking facility and Bhakt Niwas (residential facility for visitors to Mahalaxmi temple). The state government has recently sanctioned a Rs 80-crore plan for development of the temple and other facilities. 
 
 “Taking steps for implementation of the plan is the priority for us and accordingly I have asked the officials to remove the encroachments. I have asked the officials to survey the number of encroachers and first issue them notices to vacate the land,” Dhawale said. 
 
 The land is occupied by around 80 scrap vendors who, according to the civic authorities, are carrying out their businesses without permission. The vendors had objected to the proposal to mark the plot for parking and residential facilities during drafting of the temple development plan. The civic authorities said they have identified the sites where the vendors can be relocated. 
 
 Dhawale also discussed the issue of projects being implemented under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. Out of the 746 people who had applied for homes undwer the scheme, around 150 have been qualified for receiving the grants up to Rs 2.5 lakh. “In the next three to four months, the government will start releasing funds in the accounts of the beneficiaries. We will meet the state government officials for approval of the project sent by the KMC seeking funds,” he said.
