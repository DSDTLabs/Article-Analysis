Colva: Tuesday’s downpour threw normal life out of gear in most parts of Goa. 

 Though the situation was comparatively better than last year, people living in   had to make do without power supply for a couple of hours. The electricity department and fire services staff were inundated with calls for help from members of the general public.
 
 According to the department of fire and emergency services, rescue personnel had to respond to as many as nine calls of trees uprooting. 
 
 “We had to clear trees at three places in Cuncolim; two in Navelim and Fatorda, respectively, and one each at Aquem Baixo and Chinchinim. In as many as five cases, trees fell across roads disrupting traffic movement. In two incidents, mango trees fell on a compound wall and a house in Cuncolim, respectively. However, no person was injured in these cases,” said a fire official.
 
 Power supply along the coastal belt was stable with the exception of Carmona village, where a coconut tree fell on the transmission line, cutting off power supply. Electricity department staff had to shut down the transformers to restore power supply and work on repairing of ‘jumpers’ was on through the evening.
