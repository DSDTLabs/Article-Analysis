Pune: Pune airport’s expansion plan is likely to receive a boost with a meeting between Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Indian Air Force (IAF) expected to take place next week on the issue of transfer of development rights (TDR) of two plots belonging to IAF to the state government. After a meeting with PMC officials on Monday, Pune MP Anil Shirole said that they will discuss the issue of transfer of plots with IAF so that they can be later transferred to AAI for construction of a storage yard and an office complex. Last month, chairman of the infrastructure committee, Nitin Gadkari, had asked the state government to immediately transfer 25 acres of land to IAF and AAI. Out of the 25 acres, IAF will receive 15 acres of land in lieu of the 15.84 acres which the IAF had given to AAI, while the remaining 10 acres will go to AAI. “It had also been said that some of the unused land belonging to IAF should be provided to the state government through land transfer. There are three plots of land and two among them are under the control of IAF. While one of them will be used for construction of a multi-storeyed parking lot, the other two, which are controlled by IAF, will be used for offices and a storage facility. However, the IAF needs to transfer the above two plots to the state government and a meeting is expected next week between IAF and PMC,” an official said Pune airport director Ajay Kumar had earlier said that while they had received possession of 15.84 acres from IAF, they were yet to receive another plot measuring around 15 acres. IAF has said that in exchange of the land, the state government should give them additional land near the airport so that they can develop infrastructure in the new place. The land transferred earlier is being used for development of a new terminal building.
