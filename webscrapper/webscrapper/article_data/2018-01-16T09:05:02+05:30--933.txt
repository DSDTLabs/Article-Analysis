CHANDIGARH: In what appears to be a situation of once bitten, twice shy, the   police has barred   from organizing mega event   anniversary celebrations, involving a huge gathering, without taking proper clearance from the local administration.

 Inspector Vinod Kumar, SHO of   police station, formally pasted notices on the walls of Dera Sacha Sauda premises last Friday. According to notice, the law and order situation has been given the reason. “In August, last year, the district had seen a law and order situation due to violence in various areas around the dera. Since the investigation of the cases is in progress and the main accused in the case are already at large, organizing such a programme may lead to a law and order situation. Hence, they have been asked to take all clearances and permissions,” said Vinod.
 
 “We have told the dera management that it will be liable to face action in case they organize any such programme without permission,” he added.
 
 The dera has announced to celebrate the event in a grand way on January 25. Even as the dera head is lodged in jail and most members of the dera executive committee are behind the bars while two key functionaries Aditya Insan and dera chairperson   have gone into hiding, dera followers had started the preparations.
