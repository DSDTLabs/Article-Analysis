MUMBAI: Intensifying the search for the body of BBlunt Salon executive  , the crime branch police on Wednesday deployed two camera-fitted drones to scour through the dense mangroves on either sides of a nullah behind IMAX theatre in Wadala, where her two colleagues claimed to have dumped the body. 

 "It is very difficult to enter the mangrove stretch as the land is marshy," said an officer. A team of 20 investigators along with local fishermen searched for the body in the nullah.
 
 Vyas (28) was reported missing after her colleagues, Siddesh Tamhankar and  , picked her up in an SUV from near house on March 16 morning. 
 
 Meanwhile, the police have started inquiring if Tamhankar, a junior accounts executive, had indulged in double payments and manipulation of accounts and caught by Kirti. This is because Kirti had issued him a memo and put him on a one-month notice in February. In the memo, she had asked him to rectify the errors and irregularities in the accounts that he had cleared. "My sister had told my father about having issued a memo to someone in her office and being unhappy with the junior accounts staff's work," Vyas's elder sister Shefali had told TOI on May 5. -V Narayan
