GURUGRAM: A 12-year-old girl returning home with her 7-year-old sister from her father’s factory was forcibly pulled inside a “red car” and abducted near   village of Gurgaon on Friday.

 Police are yet to trace the girl after 12 hours of the alleged abduction. They have, however, lodged a case of   against unknown persons.
 
 Police sources said 10 teams, including those from crime unit, had been pressed into service to trace the girl.
 
 Sources said the girl’s family hailed from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh and lived in   Khatola village. She and her sister would go to the factory, located a kilometer away from their home, to reach food for their father every morning. 
 
  
  
 
 It was around 8.30am when the two sisters were returning home from the factory. The “red car” screeched to a halt and the occupants inside pulled the elder sister into the vehicle, the sources said. The younger sister rushed home and informed her mother.
 
 “My daughters would go every day to the factory to reach food for their father. They were returning home when my elder daughter was abducted. The stretch as foggy and so there were fewer people on the road,” the girls’ mother said.
 
 “It’s been 12 hours and the police are yet to get any lead. We fear for the safety of our children. It’s a shame that children are not safe even during the day,” said a paanchayat member at Begumpur Khatola.
 
 The police have registered an FIR against unknown persons under Section 365 (kidnap) of the IPC.
 
 “The teams are searching for the child. We hope to find her soon,” said  , DCP (south).
