MUMBAI: Expect to breathe easy in the coming days as the air quality index (AQI) in the city has moved to the   category after almost a fortnight. System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an   of 150 on Monday morning, which improved to 148 by the evening. Researchers at   said the air quality is expected to remain in the moderate or good category in the coming days.

 Mumbai’s AQI had been in the poor category for over two weeks as wind speeds remained calm. On the day after Holi, Mumbai had recorded an AQI of 250. An AQI of 201-300 is considered poor and can harm the health of sensitive people. Monday’s AQI falls in the moderate category and is acceptable for the general public though it poses a moderate health concern for sensitive people.
 
 SAFAR project director Gufran Beig said, “Good days are ahead of us. Pollution is expected to clear and this is normal course once temperatures are higher, pushing the boundary layer of pollutants upwards. Wind speeds too pick up during the warm months of summer. We expect pollution levels will remain in the good (0-100) and moderate (101-200) category now.”
 
 Among the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, the most polluted was Bandra-Kurla Complex with an AQI of 301 (very poor). Balancing out the city’s AQI were Chembur, Colaba and Worli, which recorded an AQI in the good category, with Worli being the cleanest at 79.
 
 SAFAR has forecast an AQI of 153 for Tuesday.
