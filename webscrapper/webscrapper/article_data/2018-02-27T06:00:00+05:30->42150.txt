Kolkata: A Diamond Harbour court on Monday remanded Sashastra Seema Bal ( ) commanding officer Dipak Kumar Singh in police custody for two days.

 The order came on the FIR in which Singh is alleged to have opened fire in which one person was killed. In the other charge that he was forcibly taken away from police custody, the court granted him judicial custody.
 
 The state told the court that Singh had failed to show that he had sought permission from IGP (SSB) before embarking on the fake currency raid that led to the fatal shoot-out. It also argued that any special operation of this nature required prior intimation to local police since law and order fell within the stateâ€™s domain. 
 
 According to sources, Singh had argued that his trial should be held in a Force Court, citing the 2007 SSB Act. This spells out that if an SSB personnel commits murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder or rape on a civilian while on active duty he should be tried by a Force Court.
