HYDERABAD: Chillies are proving too hot to handle for TRS regime with opposition parties launching a blistering   to extend  .

 Arrest of farmers,   under the   followed by arrests of legislators, including AICC former secretary and MLC   who went to extend solidarity with the farmers, have left the ruling TRS in a tight spot. Angry farmers had burnt furniture and other items at   after chilli prices crashed.
 
 While a delegation of Congress leaders, led by leader of the opposition K Jana Reddy, visited Khammam immediately after the special session of the Assembly, Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy, who was taken into custody for sitting on a hunger strike, told TOI that they are not going to be intimidated by the government machinery.
 
 "This is CM KCR's so-called Bangaru Telangana, where farmers are arrested and Section 144 is clamped. Farmers come with thousands of bags of chillies and keep it on road. It has been a very good yield. Farmers have incurred huge debts and invested almost Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000 per quintal of chilli. But due to failure of the government to check exploitation by middlemen, farmers are being offered Rs 2,000 per quintal against Rs 12,000 per quintal they got last year," he said.
 
 Leader of opposition in the legislative council, Mohd Ali Shabbir, said the AP government is giving Rs 1,500 bonus per quintal of chilli to farmers whereas the TRS government has left them on crossroads. "Cases are being booked against farmers for protesting," he said.
 
 "We demanded market intervention fund of Rs1,000 crore to help those farmers. But the chief minister simply dismissed protests by farmers and did not regret registration of cases against them. KCR must apologise," said TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy.
