RANCHI: Sales of two-wheelers on Friday registered a seven-fold growth over   in Ranchi as customers flocked to purchase Bharat Stage (BS)-III  . Showrooms witnessed a rush of buyers since Friday morning with most companies offering discounts of up to Rs 22,000 to clear out their stocks. 

 "All our stock of BS-III vehicles were exhausted by 4pm. The sales have been at least five times higher when compared to a normal day," Puneet Poddar, owner of Premsons Honda showroom in Ranchi's Kishorganj area. "We have sufficient stock of BS-IV vehicles. We will start selling them from tomorrow," Poddar said.
 
 However, there were not as many takers for BS-III four-wheelers, prompting many dealers to register the vehicles in stock under their own names so that they can be sold later. "This was the only way to save ourselves from heavy financial losses," a dealer said.
 
 Kamal Kumar Singhania, the owner of Automotive Bajaj showroom in Ranchi's Main Road, said most of the dealers have not been able to meet the supply. "We had customers coming to us till evening, but our stock was exhausted by 4pm," Singhania said. 
 
 The Supreme Court order banning the sales of   from April 1 will not have any impact on overseas manufacturers such as Toyota, whose vehicles "are almost compliant with BS-IV norms except a few minor additions that are needed," a section of the city's dealers said. 
 
 However, many dealers in the city have expressed their discomfort at the order saying an extended deadline to liquidate the stocks would have been more feasible.
