 The incident came to light after the attendant resigned from service on January 28 and registered a complaint against him. 
 
 In her complaint, the woman said her supervisor harassed her over several trivial issues. She alleged that he would mark her absent though she had reported for duty or he shouted at her and threw water on her face.
 
 The woman said she initially ignored his advances as she needed the job and the money it provided to support her girl child. 
 
 She said that around eight months ago, when she was waiting for a bus home at night, the supervisor came from behind her and asked her to accompany him for a cup of tea, but she refused.
 
 About 15 days after this, the trouble began, the woman told police. The suspect allegedly again invited her to have a cup of tea with him but she refused, following which he began harassing her in a fit of anger.
 
 She wrote in her complaint that after she started avoiding the supervisor, he began troubling her and shouted at her for not performing her duty properly.
 
 According to the complaint, around two months ago, the woman was cleaning a toilet when the supervisor came from behind and molested her. He caught hold of her hand on the pretext of showing her how to clean a toilet. The woman panicked and asked him to not misbehave and ran out of the toilet.
 
 The woman said that since the suspect was not getting the required response from her, he started marking her absent so that he could cause monetary loss to her and filed false complaints with her superiors to show that her performance was not up to the mark, she said in the complaint. 
 
 Fed up with the regular harassment, the woman resigned from the service, a police official said, adding that a complaint under Section 354 ( ) of Indian Penal Code has been registered with the Hadapsar police.
