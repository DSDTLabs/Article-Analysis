At the   station on Saturday afternoon, busy commuters witnessed an unusual scene on platform No.1 — two babies dressed in dhoti, kurta and turban having their first grain of rice on their mukhebhaat (rice ceremony). Several others, including kids and youngsters who live on the platform, had gathered around them with garlands.

 
 Six-month-old   and seven-month-old Akash were deserted by their respective fathers within days of their birth.   and  , their young mothers, have been struggling to bring up the babies on platform No. 1. “In our tough times, the boys and girls who stay with us on this platform help us a lot. When I leave for work, they take care of my baby. Today, they begged from commuters to organise the rice-eating ceremony of my kid,” said Neel’s mother Bobby Bhattacharjee.
 
 Khusi (11), one of the kids who stay on the platform, said, “Neel and Akash are our little guests. We begged from the commuters at the station on Saturday to organise the event. Some believed us and some didn’t. But, in the end, help poured in.” Some passengers even bought gifts for the two kids.
