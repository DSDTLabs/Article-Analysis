CHANDIGARH: Adding to its laurels, including prestigious ‘Kayakalp Award’ and ‘Cleanest Hospital Award’, PGI exceled again as the tele-evidence facility was awarded “SKOCH Order-of-Merit” for being adjudged amongst the top-50 health projects in India’ for 2017 at the 47th SKOCH summit that concluded on Saturday evening at New Delhi. Skoch is a Gurgaon-based independent group dealing with social economic issues.

 This is the second consecutive “SKOCH Order-of-Merit” award won by the institute. Last year, the institute was conferred these awards for promotion of eye donation and for developing a software to help optimize average length of stay of patients in PGI.
 
 Dr A. K. Gupta, medical superintendent, PGI, said, “PGIMER is the first institution in the country to start tele-evidence facility at institutional level. Since its inception in November 2015, around 2,200 evidences have been given through tele evidence. This saved precious man-days of the doctors which were utilised in patient care. Use of eco-friendly technology of tele-evidence has helped   save around Rs 3 crore and some 75 metric tonnes of carbon foot prints.”
 
 “Recording evidence through video conference has proved immensely beneficial for patients as well as the doctors. Considering the huge benefits, the government has now decided to make this available pan India as part of its Digital India initiative,” he added.
