CHENNAI: Rioters in the city not only targeted police and their property, they vented their anger on  . Five shops were ransacked and emptied by rioters in north Chennai. 

 After pocketing several bottles, the rioters hurled the remaining stock on the road and set the liquor on fire, said a senior Tasmac official. "Four liquor shops in Vyasarpadi were ransacked, of which two were completely emptied and stock from the other two partially stolen. Another shop in Arumbakkam was also damaged," the Tasmac official told TOI.
 
 All the affected outlets had downed the shutters fearing arson and rioting in the area. "Rioters broke open all five shops and first took away the cash box and later targeted the stock. Average sales in each of the shops used to range between 1 lakh and 1.5 lakh daily," said the official. 
 
 All   in the state have stocks for 10 days. "The damage is maximum in those shops where the entire stock has been looted. We have sought for the stock position and sales since the stocks were replenished. The total damage will be known only after a few days," said the official. A rough calculation of the loss based on the stock and sales shows that the total loss may be above 10 lakh. 
 
 The corporation has filed complaints of missing cash and damage. "Police have filed FIRs and search is on to nab the culprits," said the official. "We have not taken any decision on the shifting or closing of the shops. Once we ascertain the damage and the probe progresses, we will take action," said the official.
