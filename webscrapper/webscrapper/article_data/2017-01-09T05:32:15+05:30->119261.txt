SRINAGAR: Thousands turned up at the Indoor Stadium here for the induction of J&K chief minister   Mufti’s brother   into   on Saturday, the first death anniversary of their father  . Before the event, Hussain visited Sayeed’s grave in Bijbehara.

 Thousands of people from the violence-hit   braved snowfall and traffic snarls to reach the venue in hundreds of buses and cars to see the Bengaluru-based cinematographer formally join the party. Tassaduq is likely to contest the bypoll for the   constituency that fell vacant after Mehbooba took over as CM last year.
 
 Tassaduq has worked on hit films like ‘Omkara’ and ‘Kaminey’. “I will work for the peace and prosperity of the state where the common man and VIP walk together,” he said.
 
 Amid loud applause not usually seen for politicos, he added, “I have remained away from politics all my life. But... from now on I will walk with you.” PDP youth chief Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra said Tassaduq’s plunge into politics would attract more youths into the political mainstream.
