KOLKATA: Two days after the   police under port division busted a gang that prepared fake blood reports, cops confirmed they have evidence that suggest the gang was forging signatures of at least a dozen doctors and pathologists. Cops said they have sent notices to these people to ascertain if they knew the two accused,   and  .

 
 “We found they have forged the doctor’s signatures. But then, all their contact numbers were found on the duo’s phones,” said an investigating officer.
 
 DC (Port) Syed Waquar Reza said they have recovered certain documents, which led
 
 them to believe that others are involved with the gang. Sources claimed the accused only typed the figures on the documents. “There is a possibility that lab documents were stolen. But that needs to be investigated,” claimed a source.
 
 “We have that both accused had pathological experience. But so far they failed to provide us with documents that prove they have training experience,” said Reza.
 
 Importantly, while   worked for a nursing home, he was asked to collect blood on their behalf from the poorer patients. Santosh, on the other hand, worked for a pathology centre in Moulali. He claimed that he was asked to run a franchisee on behalf of the   unit but cops are not convinced. “The owners of the nursing home and the pathological unit have been asked to explain on what grounds they had employed the accused,” said an investigating officer.
