  : Joggers who came to the city's   for a spot of exercise on Sunday morning were shocked to find hundreds of   floating on the lake amid unbearable foul smell. 

 Witnesses and lake activists said at least 800 fish have been found dead in the past three days, possibly due to lake water pollution caused by untreated sullage. The forest department has sent samples of the dead fish and contaminated water to the   for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore for investigation. Morning walkers alleged that tens of fish were showing up dead on the lake almost every day in the past couple of weeks, and the number was tragically high on Sunday.
 
 "Close to 250 dead fish were found on Sunday morning. Some 800 have died so far. Despite our complaints, the lake ecology remains precarious with no concrete action from authorities," said Rajeshwar Rao, a walker from Saraswathipuram.
 
 Activists said dead fish were more than one species, though tilapia fish accounted for a big chunk. "Most fish fatalities are reported from the north of the lake. Untreated water is being released to the lake though the issue has been hanging fire for four years. The Mysore University, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Lake Development Authority have collectively failed to resolve the problem," Jayashri Kumari, an activist said.
 
 Following petitions by the citizens, the forest department has sent samples to the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore. Deputy conservator of forests(wild-life) V Yedukondalu told TOI the lab report will help them find the cause of fish death.
 
 KM Jayaramaiah, a member of Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority, said he has written a letter to the university to change drain pipes to prevent untreated water from flowing directly into the lake. He added that the efforts will be made to find a lasting solution to the Kukarahalli fish deaths.
