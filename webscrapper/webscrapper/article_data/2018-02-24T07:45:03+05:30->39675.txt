AHMEDABAD:   on Friday issued notices to the   (ECI) and candidates including BJP MLAs of Matar, Himmatnagar and Santrampur constituencies over petitions challenging election results of the 2017 assembly polls.

 Election results of more than 20 seats have been challenged before the high court by losing candidates from Congress and BJP as well as by independent candidates.
 
 The high court has sought reply in these three matters next month, said advocate Rahul Sharma who is representing the Congress party candidates.
 
 Congress party candidates Kamlesh Patel from Himmatnagar in Sabarkantha district and Rahul Patel from Matar constituency in Kheda district have questioned the counting of votes through   (EVM) and they have demanded a recounting through VVPAT slips. They have contended that not allowing VVPAT counting on all booths is against the law.
 
 The Congress party candidate from Santrampur seat in Mahisagar-Lunavada district, Gendalbhai Damor has sought disqualification of the winner, a BJP candidate, Kuberbhai Dindor on the ground of violation of ECI norms. He has alleged that Dindor had spent more than Rs 28 lakh, and exceeded the expenditure limit set by EC. 
 
 Victories of ministers like Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, Saurabh Dalal have been challenged. Senior Congress leaders Arjun Modhwadia and Siddharth Patel have also filed petitions in the HC questioning poll results of the constituencies they contested from.
