AJNALA: The Shaheedan Wala Khu  , on Tuesday, would mark the 160th martyrdom anniversary of 282 people from Punjab killed in the 1857   the British. The organisers also plan to draw Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s attention to their demand for seeking martyr status for the fighters. 

 Talking to TOI on Monday, president of the committee   said it was unfortunate that despite being the only memory of the 1857 revolt against the British in Punjab, successive state governments had done nothing to restore the honour of martyrs. “It was due to their sacrifice that we are enjoying the freedom,” said Sarkaria.
 
 According to historian  , as the news of the outbreak of freedom struggle in Meerut and Delhi broke, the 26th Native Infantry Regiment posted at Mian Mir, near Lahore, was disarmed on May 13, 1857, and placed under surveillance.
 
 Kochhar’s research noted that on July 30, 1857, the soldiers of the regiment, under the leadership of  , killed a British Major and a Sergeant Major and headed towards Ajnala. The soldiers bravely crossed the flooded Ravi and reached the adjoining Ajnala town. However, acting on a tip-off,  , the then deputy commissioner of Amritsar, ordered that all of them were put in a cage-like room of the Old Tehsil where about 200 soldiers died of asphyxiation.
 
 The rest of them were shot August 1, 1857 and their bodies were dragged and thrown in a well which later came to be known as Kalian Wala Khu (well of the blacks), which was later renamed as Shaheedan Wala Khu.
 
 Amarinder, during his visit to Ajnala in April 2014, had expressed support for granting martyr status to all the victims of Shaheedan Wala Khu, besides promising to perform their last rites with full military honour. “Now Amarinder is the chief minister of state and he should fulfill his promise,” said Sarkaria, adding that the martyrs place should be connected with the state tourism circuit.
