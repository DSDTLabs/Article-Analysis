PATNA: The city’s   ranked 12th in the fiscal 2017-18 in terms of flyer footfall growth. 

 The airport registered 47.3% growth in passenger flow last fiscal. The corresponding figure for the previous fiscal was 33.3%. 
 
 The only other international airport in Bihar at Gaya, on the other hand, registered a meagre 5.1% growth in passenger flow in 2017-18 compared to 37.7% in 2016-17 fiscal.
 
 According to   (AAI) figures, the Patna airport handled 31,11,273 flyers in 2017-18 as against 21,12,150 flyers in 2016-17.
 
 A comparative study of the growth figures of other main airports of the country suggests the Patna airport registered 12th growth in percentage increase in passengers’ flow in 2017-18 over the previous fiscal. It had ranked 18th on this count in 2016-17.
 
 Patna airport officials attributed the growth to increase in the number of flights. The flights operating from Patna in 2012-13 numbered around 10, and they now total 38.
 
 “The Patna airport has become one of the country’s busiest airports. The increase in the number of flights has also led to drop in airfares, making flights affordable to many,” airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria told TOI.
 
 Airlines are also upbeat. According to an private airlines’ executive, a   flight airfare ranges from Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 involving travel time of 2-2.5 hours, while the Patna-Delhi flight airfare ranges from Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000 involving travel time of around 90 minutes. “It’s wiser to fly than to travel by train to such destinations,” he said.
 
 Aviation experts say the flyer flow is expected to rise further now that late night operation of flights has begun from the city airport since March 25. As of now, Jet   operates one flight on Pune-Patna-Pune route in late night.
 
 The AAI is likely to commence work on the development of a new state-of-the-art terminal building at the city airport in next three-four months to overcome the problem of space crunch in the existing terminal building.
