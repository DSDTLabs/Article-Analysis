BHOPAL: Four days after the government's admission of cash crisis, there is hardly any relief as a large number of ATMs across the state are still running dry. And in rural areas, many banks made it mandatory to pay part of the cash in Rs 10 coin, when people withdraw money. 

 In smaller places like Sagar, Damoh, Chhatarpur and Tikamgarh, private and public sector banks are giving Rs 10 coins.
 
 "As ATMs were dry, I withdrew Rs 10,000 from an SBI branch in Sagar and they gave me Rs 1,000 in form of Rs 10 coins," said  , a farmer in Sagar, where a large number of ATMs were dry.
 
 Many bank branches restricted withdrawal of cash up to Rs 10,000 only.
 
 On Thursday, additional chief secretary (finance)   said, "The shortage continues and the government of India certainly must be taking measures to improve availability of the currency as per the need of the economy and the people."
 
 Three days ago, state finance minister Jayant   had appealed to people to withdraw less cash. Malaiya had told TOI the state was facing a severe cash crisis and the government had been in touch with the RBI and the Centre. 
 
 A day before his admission, CM   had raised the "conspiracy angle " for shortage of Rs 2000 notes.
 
 People in rural area were the worst-affected on Akshaya Tritiya - the day which sees many marriages as it is considered auspicious for tying the nuptial knot. Many were not able to get cash from cooperative bank branches and other bank branches.
 
 "We have enough bank balance, but I cannot withdraw it though I desperately need it for my daughter's wedding," said a farmer.
