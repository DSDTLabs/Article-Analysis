PATNA: Three days after Patna high court’s order that no two-wheeler or car can be checked without   coverage, Patna   Manu Maharaaj on Friday said more CCTV cameras would be installed at various locations in the city soon.

 The high court, while hearing a writ petition on Tuesday regarding the alleged thrashing of lawyer Vishal Vikram Rana and his younger brother   by quick mobile constables of Patna police in the name of checking their vehicle for liquor smuggling, had asked the SSP to lodge an FIR against the accused police personnel and initiate criminal proceedings against them.
 
 “An FIR was lodged against seven accused police personnel with the Kankerbagh police station on Wednesday,” the SSP said, adding four accused quick mobile constables have already been suspended.
 
 “Departmental proceedings have been initiated against the accused cops. The FIR was lodged on the basis of written complaint submitted by high court lawyer Vishal Vikram Rana,” the SSP added.
 
 The matter will again come up for hearing on June 20 when the SSP will submit a counter affidavit in the high court, detailing the steps taken to ensure that no two-wheeler or car is checked without CCTV coverage.
