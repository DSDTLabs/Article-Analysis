PANAJI: A   in the outpatient department (OPD) of the Goa medical college and hospital,  , on Saturday morning caused a small fire which was quickly put out.

 The fire occurred near the two pharmacies and in close vicinity of the ATM after 11 am. It was put out with a broom by a staff member of one of the pharmacies.
 
 Being a Saturday, there wasnâ€™t a rush in the otherwise overcrowded OPD block.
 
 Earlier, the corridor was used to take patients in wheelchairs and stretchers to the first floor, but now they use the lift. Nobody was injured in the incident, but, the cables behind the ATM were badly damaged by the fire.
 
 A couple of weeks ago, TOI had highlighted how mixed garbage dumped inside the   was being set on fire. Acting on it, health minister Vishwajit Rane initiated work to clear the garbage.
