VIJAYAWADA: Medicos are mighty worried over the   (NEXT), which makes it compulsory for every MBBS student to pass the test in order to complete the MBBS.
As of now medicos have to clear 14 examinations as part of MBBS, conducted as per the   (MCI) standards and they believe NEXT will put more pressure on them. “This will adversely affect the public healthcare because it is natural for the students to focus more on the exam than doing practice, which will destroy the purpose of the house surgency programme,“ said  , a third year medico. The medicos also demanded that the government increase the number of   proportionately as the present system leaves only 10% of seats in general category .
