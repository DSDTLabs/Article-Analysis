MEERUT: Renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom   has issued another controversial fatwa, in which it has now asked Muslim families to avoid marrying men or women working in banks as the money earned through interest is illegitimate in the eyes of Islam.

 While replying to a query forwarded by someone who was seemingly getting proposals of marriage, the online department of fatwa on the official website of   seminary said, “Marrying in such family is not preferable. ”
