Residents point out several issues plaguing the   distribution through tankers. While people residing near the main roads get water catered through the tankers trucks, those residing a bit far are left out.

 Residents also say that the tankers are stopped regularly at the same places. It benefits only a certain people residing next to the stoppage as they can collect more water, while others could not get as much. Moreover, some of the truck drivers entertain filling water in barrels, which can hold between 200 litres and 250 litres, although filling of water only in pots is allowed.
 
 S Aparna, a resident from  , said that the truck drivers want to drain the truck as quickly as possible and leave the place rather than ensuring all the residents get equal share. "As they stop at the same place regularly, only those residing nearby are benefitted. The issue can be rectified, if the trucks change the stoppage every time. But the drivers are not ready for that," she said.
 
 K Janarthanan, a resident from   in Tahsildar Nagar, said that the truck is not entering the roads other than the main roads. They have appealed to the drivers many times, but they are not even ready to listen to it. "They do not want to distribute water in the smaller lanes, as they want to leave the place as quickly as possible so that they can do more trips," he said.
 
 A truck driver said that at a time when the water need is increasing, it would delay them if they covered all the roads, unless they can make more trips.
 
 When contacted an engineering official, said that he will look into the issues and take steps to resolve them.
