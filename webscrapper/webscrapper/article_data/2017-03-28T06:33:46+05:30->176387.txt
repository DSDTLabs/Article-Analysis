 Malavika M of Vana Vani Matriculation and   on the IIT-M campus, said very few questions were from earlier papers. “Some were also tricky in the way they were framed. While the 1 mark and 10 mark questions were easy, the 6-mark questions is where many of us struggled,“ she said.
 
  branch head Poonam Gaglani, said several students didnt expect it to be `of this level'.“There was one 6-mark question that was particularly tough to crack,“ she said.
