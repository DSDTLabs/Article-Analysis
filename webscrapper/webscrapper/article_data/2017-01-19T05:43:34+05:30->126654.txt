Taking advantage of the chaos the shooters fled. Locals rushed Nigam to a local hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 Politicians, leaders of trader unions as well as street vendors and petty shop owners reached the incident site. District magistrate YR Mishra and SSP Nitin Tiwari also reached the site. During initial investigation local traders informed the police that few hours before the killing some youths were urinating near a shop in an inebriated state in Jawahar market which led to a scuffle between them and local traders. Nigam was also called to intervene into the matter. Police are suspecting this incident as one of the possible causes behind his killing.
