HYDERABAD: The city may be experiencing light rains now, but the   (IMD) has warned of a heat wave with the mercury all set to rise significantly in the next few days.

 Meteorologists said premonsoon showers often lead to heatwave conditions. “The temperature will rise by one to two degree in the next few days and eventually hit the 40 degree Celsius mark by the end of this month,“ IMD (Hyderabad) director  .
 
 Officials of IMD predicted that the summer season will be relatively hotter this year. “As compared to last year, the average temperature will be one degree higher this year. While last year Telangana observed 24 days of heat wave, the number of heatwave days would be higher this year,“ said Reddy, adding that April and May would certainly be hotter this year. For the past 10 days, Hyderabad has been humid and the IMD has issued thundersquall warning for Hyderabad, Shamshabad and Mahbubnagar among other districts. But officials said isolated spells of rain would only increase the temperature and humidity levels. “The pre-monsoon showers have been triggered by formation of abrupt change of wind direction leading to formation of rain-bearing clouds. We expect the temperature to gradually soar from Saturday onwards,“ said Reddy.
 
 Skymet, the private weather forecasting unit too said that pre-monsoon sho wers had arrived earlier than usual. “However, due to the absence of any weather system in the near future, hot weather is also expected to prevail over the region,“ said   in a statement. According to Skymet, premonsoon showers are likely during late afternoon or evening, but would not offer much respite.
