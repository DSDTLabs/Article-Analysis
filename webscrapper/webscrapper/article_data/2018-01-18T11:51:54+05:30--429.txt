GUWAHATI: Having lost its recognition and symbol in a similar set of circumstances earlier,  's ruling Naga People's Front ( ) is treading cautiously on the ever-growing demand to postpone assembly election in the state until a resolution to the Naga peace process is announced, choosing to remain silent on the issue as of now. 

 NPF president   on Wednesday said his party would not want a rerun of 1998 when they had, responding to a call by the Naga Hoho - the apex body of the Naga tribes - boycotted the election seeking a solution to the peace process and not election. The Naga peace talks have been on with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) since 1997.
 
 "We responded to the Naga Hoho's call and suffered heavily. Because of our non-participation, the government was taken over by Congress (the only party which remained in the fray in 1998) for five years without contesting," Shurhozelie told TOI. The NPF had to pay heavily for the decision. "Because we stayed away from the election, the   de-recognized our party and froze the party symbol. The following year, I contested the   election and we secured 32% votes, much higher than the required 6% to win back the EC's recognition and the party symbol," he added.
 
 An NPF statement said, "The party is yet to know whether election would come in time or not when so many people and organisations have woken up from their slumber and have started to talk loudly about solution to the Naga political problem at the moment. The party is for solution of the Naga political problem from the beginning till date and, therefore, the party is keeping silent and awaiting the outcome. The only thing that we discussed in the meeting (Monday's meeting of central office-bearers) was that we do not want to repeat the 1998 experience and hand over the government as a free gift to some political parties."
