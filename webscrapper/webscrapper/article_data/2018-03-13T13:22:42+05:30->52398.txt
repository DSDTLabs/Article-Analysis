MYSURU: Led by commissioner G Jagadeesha,   (MCC) resumed its drive against the sale of plastic on Monday. During a random inspection undertaken at   on Monday,   personnel seized more than 10,000kg of banned plastic substances at the Sathyanarayana Trader  , the largest seizure in the civic body’s history.

 MCC environmental engineer Mythri, who participated in the raid, said, “It was a random check, and we raided a godown at Old Santhepete that falls under the purview of ward no. 36. We uncovered and subsequently seized more than 10,000kg of banned plastic substances that included carry bags and straws. Those who were penalised during our last raid were not found selling banned plastic, but other traders are found to be selling them. We will penalise those found to be indulging in the sale of these substances, and take stringent action against the traders, including cancellation of the licence. We have sealed the godown. We will also initiate criminal action against the owner.”
 
 She added that the civic body had been unable to undertake raids in the past few months since it was involved in a slew of activities related to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. “But, under the guidance of our commissioner, more such raids will be taken up and we will act tough against those found to be violating the rule. Environmental engineer Madhukar and KSPCB officers were also part of our raid,” Mythri added.
