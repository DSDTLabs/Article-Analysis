BENGALURU: The Karnataka Badminton Association’s attempt to rope in high-profile international coaches for its summer camp here ended in disappointment on Tuesday. 

 
 
 
 The Malaysians it had invited to train a select group of players were asked to leave the country immediately for visa violation. Acting on a complaint, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) checked the immigration documents of doubles specialist Malaysian badminton player   and 2009 World Championship men's doubles bronze medalist   and found that they were in India on a tourist visa.
 
 
 
 On Monday, FRRO officials went to KBA and stopped the training, citing immigration rules that foreign tourists cannot take up employment without a valid visa. On Tuesday, FRRO issued orders for the coaches to leave, sources told TOI. The duo left for Malaysia late Tuesday night.
 
 KBA sources told TOI: "We didn't arrange for their visa. Neither were we aware they had come on a tourist visa. We were told they were coaching in Vietnam and Indonesia and obviously didn't have enough time to process their visa.”
