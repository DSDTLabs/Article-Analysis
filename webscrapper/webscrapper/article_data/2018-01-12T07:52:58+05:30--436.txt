HYDERABAD: Having identified nearly 500 secondary and tertiary junctions that need   to cope with the rising vehicular traffic choking the city's roads, Hyderabad traffic police has urged GHMC to set up traffic signals in 35 new secondary and tertiary junctions for a smoother traffic flow. 

 These signals are expected to be up and running in couple of months, said AV Ranganath, DCP (traffic), Hyderabad, adding that Madhura Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Srinagar Colony, Mallepally Road, Puranapul,   Nagar, Yousufguda, Prashasan Nagar, Borabanda and Vijayanagar are areas where signals have been mooted.
 
  
 Currently, Hyderabad has nearly 225 primary or major signalled junctions, most which are located on highways and main roads. "The situation becomes chaotic at secondary and tertiary junctions currently being handled by just one traffic cop. With rising vehicular population, the relatively smaller colonies too are facing congestion. GHMC has given our proposal a positive response and the new signals should come up in two months," Ranganath explained.
 
 A staff crunch too is making it increasingly difficult for the traffic police to manage new areas without traffic signals. "Like every other department, we too are facing a staff shortage, especially at the constable level. However, we have deployed around 1,000 home guards to address traffic issues in smaller colonies. We plan to deploy at least one traffic cop in such colonies for smooth traffic flow," said V Ravindra, joint commissioner of police, traffic.
 
 The department has also closed nearly 30 major junctions in the past one year and are diverting traffic to better manage the traffic congestion.
