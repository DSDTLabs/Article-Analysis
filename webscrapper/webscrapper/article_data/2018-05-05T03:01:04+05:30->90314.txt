NEW DELHI: It’s been exactly a year since   gave death sentence to the four accused in the   rape case. It was also an emotional moment for Nirbhaya’s mother who broke down in front of the press saying that her fight hadn’t ended as she could do little for helpless victims like her daughter. She, along with  , would be appealing to the government demanding extreme sentence for rapists through an Act.

 Speaking to TOI, she listed the problems that need to be resolved so that rape survivors can come out to report the crime and pursue the case. She said that seeing the number of cases wherein little girls are being raped only makes her faith in the system dwindle as she had hoped things would get better and stringent laws would be made after the outrage over Nirbhaya’s rape and killing.
 
 “After my daughter was raped and killed, many women across the globe tried their best to make the government create a more women-friendly environment. Back then we felt things would change, but I feel it is only getting worse with time. Girls as young as eight months are being raped. The government launched many campaigns such as ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’, but to no effect. No scheme or Bill to protect women got past the paperwork stage,” said Nirbhaya’s mother.
 
 Nirbhaya’s mother emphasised on the need for timely action and revival of the movement. She added that court cases should be time-bound. Other suggestions included creating a special forensics department and getting women doctors to make rape survivors feel comfortable.
 
 She also highlighted on the importance of police and how they must behave responsibly and be friendly with survivors. There is also a need to increase the number of women cops.
 
 Members of Nirbhaya Jyoti Trust claimed that an Act with stringent provisions for rapists, if enforced, would be life-changing for many survivors and guarantee security for women of all ages across the country.
