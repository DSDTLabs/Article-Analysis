Taking a dig at chief minister Akhilesh Yadav while quoting SP's poll slogan `Kaam Bolta Hai', Shah said, “Have you seen SP's work speak? Let me present before you the achievements of SP government under its regime, the state has topped the charts in rape, murder, robbery , kidnapping and goonda gardi (lawlessness). Statistics shows that 23 murders and 26 rape cases are reported everyday and only yesterday (Sunday) about 200 m away from a police outpost, Rs. 41cr was looted from a jewellry shop in state capital, Lucknow. Isse kaam nahi karnaama bolte hain (This is not work but deeds that speak).“
 
 Shah attacked both SP and BSP for being “responsible for a litany of murders during their rule“. “Unki (SP and BSP) ki sarkaron mein khoon ki nadiyan behti hai, lekin humari sarkar aane par doodh aur ghee ki nadiyan bahengi (While their rule has been all about murders, ours will ensure provision of milk and clear butter),“ he said.
