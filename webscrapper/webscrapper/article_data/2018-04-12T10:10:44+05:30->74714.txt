 Chennithala demanded stringent action against all erring police officers responsible for the death of a youth in police custody at Varapuzha. "Three policemen were suspended.

 Speaking to reporters, MP Kodikunnil Suresh said that Alphons Kannanthanam, Union minister of state for tourism, is not saying anything about his portfolio. "He speaks about railway projects. The Union government has not included Chengannur railway station in their development projects. Kannamthanam, who announced the other day that Chengannur railway station will be upgraded to global standards, is cheating people by giving false promises,'' he said.
 
  district president K Soman in a press conference said   leaders are propagating false news about BJP fearing the latter's victory in Chengannur.
