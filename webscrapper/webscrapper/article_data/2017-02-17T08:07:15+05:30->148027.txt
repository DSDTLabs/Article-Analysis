KOCHI: A group of animal rights activists in the city, under the guidance of Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organizations (FIAPO), is set to hold a street dog   campaign titled ‘From Streets to Home’ on Sunday.

 “Our primary intention is to ensure adoption of rescued puppies and kittens . We have plenty of rescued stray and abandoned adult dogs and cats. We plan to put up pictures and posters of them hoping that some might express interest in adopting them,” said  , an animal rights activist working with Humanity for Animals (HFA).
 
 To make the drive more productive, the group will also have   to conduct free anti-rabies vaccination drive for pets that are brought to the location.
 
 “Alongside the adoption drive, we will also be providing information on any doubts relating to animal welfare and the present scenario. Free saplings will be handed over to all adopting families to ensure a greener cleaner tomorrow along with free pedigree samples for the adopted pups,” Aswini said.
 
 The drive is organized in association with other NGOs like Dhyaan foundation, Theruvoram and Daya.
 
 “There are apprehensions about how successful the drive might be, given the fear-mongering that has been around for a while about street dogs. However, these are not new-fangled problems for Kochi city alone,” said Dr Akshay V Prabhu, a volunteer with HFA.
 
 Akshay added that the craze for high-breed dogs, which cannot acclimatize to tropical temperatures and fall ill easily, have also resulted in increase in number of abandoned high-breed dogs in streets.
