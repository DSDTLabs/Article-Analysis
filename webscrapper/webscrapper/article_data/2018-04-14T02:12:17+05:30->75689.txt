NEW DELHI: For the first time in its 68-year history, the   decided on Friday to examine the feasibility of devising an in-house mechanism to regulate the   of India’s exclusive power to allocate cases to various benches, in what is being seen as a fallout of the public complaint by four most senior judges that they were not being assigned important cases.

 
 Entertaining a PIL by former law minister and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan, but disagreeing with his demand to devolve the CJI’s exclusive power to allocate “cases of importance” to the collegium comprising the first five   judges (in the order of seniority), a bench of Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said there could be no review of the settled position that the   was the master of the roster.
 
 However, the bench sought the assistance of attorney general K K Venugopal and additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta to help it examine a narrower aspect — whether an in-house mechanism could be devised to regulate the CJI’s case-allocation power. The SC’s inclination even to examine feasibility of this narrow issue signals a huge shift from the more-than-half-century-old traditional power of the CJI.
 
 The four rebelling judges had specifically raised the CJI assigning “sensitive” cases to “select benches” headed by “junior judges.” Congress kept the issue alive by making it part of the draft removal motion against CJI Dipak Misra and it was fanned by Justice J Chelameswar’s periodic media interactions.
 
 Dushyant Dave, Kapil Sibal and Prashant Bhushan appeared for the petitioner and attempted to raise the grievances of senior judges but were stopped by the bench of Justices Sikri and Bhushan.
 
 The bench said the suggestion to entrust the collegium with the power to decide allocation of cases to benches appeared impractical as nearly one lakh cases were filed annually in the apex court. Dave said an overwhelming majority of cases got routinely allocated to benches as per the roster and only cases involving sensitive matters should be decided by the collegium.
