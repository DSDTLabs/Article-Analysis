Nagpur: Dr Charanjeet Singh Saluja, who runs a private nursing home at  , saved the face of the government and Gadchiroli police by ensuring that the casualties did not mount following the blast on Koti-Hemalkasa Road in Bhamragarh taluka on Wednesday.

 One C-60 jawan, Suresh Telami, had died and another 23 injured in the blast. Dr Saluja, who was advised not to risk his life, rushed to Bhamragarh where the injured jawans were writhing in pain. The Naxalites tried to intercept him near Perimili but he dodged past a bike parked in the middle of the road being manned by a Naxalite. The doctor could reach only till Perimili in an mine-protected vehicle (MPV) of the police department as the cops refused to go ahead as there was an input of ambush. 
 
 The private practitioner claimed that he then ventured into the Perimili village before spotting a car at a wedding party. “I requested the people there to lend me the vehicle for reaching Bhamragarh,” he said. 
 
 “We drove at a speed of around 100 kmph and kept the windows of the car open and switched on the internal lights as Naxalites do not target civilian vehicle,” he said.
 
 Dr Saluja said that Telami, who had multiple fractures and head injury, did not respond to his cardiac-massage and other resuscitation techniques in absence of a ventilator. “We could bring back PSI Deepak Mandwalkar from the jaws of death with ‘haemaccel’, which acts as a replacement of blood in emergency situations. His urinary bladder was ruptured and he was in a state of shock. Another jawan Namdeo Bogami had a serious chest injury and a fractured hip-joint. He too was pulled out of critical situation,” he said. 
 
 Later, Dr Saluja coordinated with doctors in Nagpur to shift the jawans here for advanced treatment. He confirmed that some private hospitals in the city had refused to admit the jawans.
