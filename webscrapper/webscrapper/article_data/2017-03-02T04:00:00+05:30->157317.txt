Surat: Hundreds of commuters and pedestrians passing from beneath the leaking Sahara Darwaja railway underpass can heave a sigh of relief.

 The Western Railway (WR) has started the procedure for making temporary arrangement by fixing tin sheets as roofing to prevent the leakage of human excreta from the trains passing above the Sahara Darwaja railway underpass. 
 
 Officials said that the WR has already issued tender for setting up the temporary tin sheet roofing structure   railway underpass and it is in the final stage of approval. The work is likely to start after the Holi. 
 
 The WR authorities have written an official letter to the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) for carrying out traffic planning at Sahara Darwaja before the work begins.
 
 Things at the WR moved at the lightning speed following the visit of Union railway minister Suresh Prabhu to the Diamond City in the first week of February. 
 
 The WR’s general manager and senior SMC officials had conducted a meeting following strong representation by the Surat MP Darshana Jardosh and the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) for taking up the long-pending issues concerning railways in the city. 
 
 As per an estimate provided by the civic body, around 2.5 lakh vehicles and around 1.50 lakh pedestrians pass from the Sahara Darwaja railway underpass on daily basis. The vehicles and pedestrians have to literally stop whenever the trains pass from the tracks, to avoid the filthy droppings. 
 
 RTI activist, Rajesh Modi, who was actively pursuing the issue with WR and SMC said, “A strong representation was made to the railway minister during his visit in the city.”
