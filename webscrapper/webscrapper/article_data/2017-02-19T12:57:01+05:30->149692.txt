BHOPAL: Bollywood star Akshay Kumar said Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh was cleaner than Mumbai.

 Addressing a press conference at Hoshangabad on Saturday, Bollywood celebrity said more than 54% people in the country still don’t have toilets. Diarrhoea is one of the leading causes of death among children in the country, he said. He also criticised stone pelters in Kashmir while responding to questions from media.
 
 On Friday, Akshay had to suspend the shoot of his upcoming film ‘Toilet-Ek Prem Katha’ in Hoshangabad for nearly two hours following a demonstration against bouncers by local residents. Police had to use mild force to bring the situation under control.
 
 Police said there was a minor dispute between bouncers, which was sorted out and the shoot resumed. Residents, however, alleged that bouncers had misbehaved with local women at the shoot and demanded an apology. It took police two hours to handle the situation.
 
 Some of the bouncers were brought by the film crew and some were locally hired. The trouble began when bouncers started clearing the crowd during the film shoot in a narrow lane.
 
 Based on the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, ‘Toilet- Ek Prem Katha’ stars Bhumi Pednekar, who made her Bollywood debut with the National Award winning film ‘Dum Laga Ke Haisha’. The film is jointly produced by Neeraj Pandey and Vikram Malhotra of ‘Baby’, ‘Special 26’ and ‘Rustom’ fame and is expected to release later this year.
