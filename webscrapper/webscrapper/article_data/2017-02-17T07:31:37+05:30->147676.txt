 He added that the state government had no objection in providing financial help and jobs to the family members of those who lost their lives during the agitation last year. 
 
 Referring to the demand of withdrawal of cases filed during last year’s agitation, Dhankar said the state government had withdrawn about 1,500 cases till date while 622 are pending.
 
 The minister further claimed that the BJP government had given reservation to the Jat community the way they asked for and their suggestions were conceded. He added that the matter was challenged in the court after which senior advocate Jagdeep Dhankar was engaged for pursuing the case. He also criticised the Congress saying that it hurriedly gave reservation to the Jats without following due procedure.
