 ( ): Khuwara was a village in mourning after losing 13 children and a 21-year-old girl, who was to get married soon, in Monday’s school bus accident. 

 A total of 27 people, including 23 kids, were killed when the vehicle fell into a gorge. Grief pervaded the whole village and heart-rending scenes could be seen everywhere on Tuesday morning as the bodies of the children were readied for the last rites and carried through the village streets to the funeral site.
 
 Thousands of people from Khuwara and nearby villages thronged the funeral site to bid adieu to the 13 children — in the age group of 4-12. With no proper road leading to the cremation ground, a path had to be hastily laid out with the help of a JCB machine. Many villagers blamed the authorities for not maintaining the link road. 
 
  said the road on which the accident took place was slippery after morning rain and there were no crash barriers along it. “It is hard to believe that we lost 13 children,” said  . 
 
 Attributing the accident to the rundown road, he asked, “Can they return our children…What was their fault… How will their parents live now.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the   high court has taken suo motu cognizance of   and issued notices to the state government and the school management. It has fixed April 20 as next date of hearing.
