NEW DELHI: A joint team of   and ED officials has reached London armed with documents to persuade lawyers of UK's Crown Prosecution Service on the "dual criminality" committed by   of cheating and money laundering, so a strong case for the former liquor baron's extradition could be presented in court on May 17. 

  Sources said that a four-member team led by CBI additional director  , a joint director of Enforcement Director and two of their subordinates are discussing finer points with Indian high commission officials. 
 
  While CBI and ED are not parties to extradition arguments in court, the material provided by them will assist CPS lawyers to counter pleas expected to be taken by Mallya to avoid extradition. "The officials will explain that here is no political motive behind Mallya's extradition request," said a source.
