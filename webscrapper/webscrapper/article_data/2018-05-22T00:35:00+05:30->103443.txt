Trichy: A Madras Christian College (MCC) zoology student has helped record the 100th species at the butterfly conservatory in Srirangam. G Griffith Michael, an MSc zoology student who has been interning at the conservatory, spotted the species called Pointed Ciliate Blue last Tuesday. He was doing the diversity count survey at the conservatory in the morning when he came across the species.

 An elated Michael told TOI that he felt honoured to have helped the conservatory record its 100th species. “Over the past one month, I have been doing research on butterfly activity as part of my internship at the conservatory. Once I spotted Pointed Ciliate Blue, I immediately informed the senior officials at the conservatory,” he said. Michael is set to be awarded for his effort at the butterfly conservatory on the occasion of International Day for Biological Diversity on May 22. 
 
 At the time of its inauguration, only 38 butterfly species were spotted at the conservatory which shot up to 99 earlier this month. Forest department officials said that they were proud of the recent milestone as they have been able to turn “a once abandoned land into a conservatory, which has transformed into an ideal habitat for butterflies”. 
 
 “We made sure that the conservatory was filled with host plants for egg-laying purposes and nectar plants to provide food so that butterflies, which are migratory in nature, find it conducive,” a forest range officer at the conservatory said. There are a total of 323 butterfly species in Tamil Nadu and forest officials said that recording all of them was their ultimate aim. “It will take a long time, but every subsequent species recorded gives an added value for our conservatory,” the forest range officer said. The forest division has also been planning to expand the conservatory by developing floral and medicinal gardens.
