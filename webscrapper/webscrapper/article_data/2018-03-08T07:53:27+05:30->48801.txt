HYDERABAD: Attributing the gradual rise in count of live organ donations in Telangana - majority in Hyderabad - to women, experts said at least 65-75% of kidney and liver donations registered in city's top hospitals come from female donors. 

 An estimated 10-15 live   are conducted in each of the 10 prominent hospitals every month. "Most of the time it's the woman who comes forward to extend her support - morally and through organ donation. While is it easier to convince women, under many circumstances they don't even need convincing," said Dr A V  , kidney transplant surgeon at  , Madhapur. He urged women not to ignore their health.
 
 But even as experts appreciated the contribution of women to organ donation, they called for an urgent need to dismiss the stigma associated with kidney donation. As per statistics, they said, women are more likely to be donors than recipients. "There is an urgent need to raise awareness levels about organ donation and kidney transplants. 
 
 Presently, since only a family member can opt to donate their kidney, women are more likely to be donors than men and less likely to be the recipients. Such gender-based discrimination in organ donation must be stopped soon," said Dr  , consultant transplant surgeon at KIMS Hospitals at an event organised on the eve of   and World Kidney Day.
 
 Keeping with this year's theme - 'Kidneys and Women's Health' - as declared by WHO, 11 women kidney donors and recipients spoke about reasons for kidney failure and gender discrimination in organ donation.
