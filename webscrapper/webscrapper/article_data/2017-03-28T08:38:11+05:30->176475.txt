MUMBAI: The   on Monday turned down a city woman's plea to   because the baby could be "born alive" if the process was allowed at this stage. The   suffers from a rare abnormality called the   where the brain and spinal cord connect. 

  The judgment was based on the medical evaluation conducted by the premier medical school at  , Parel, on Saturday. The pregnant woman's lawyer, Sneha Mukherji, told TOI that the evaluation also mentioned that the foetus had severe abnormality. India's Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act sets a 20-week deadline on abortions, and many women have moved the SC in the last few years for permission to medically terminate their pregnancy due to medical abnormalities (see graphic). 
 
  Regarding Monday's case, medical experts said a "live birth" would pose an ethical problem for doctors on whether or not to resuscitate the baby (Indian laws don't recognise the 'do not resuscitate' provision that is accepted in many other countries). 
 
  KEM Hospital dean Dr Avinash Supe, who headed the medical board, said, "The board took the call on medical grounds after several rounds of discussions. Moreover, the board found there is no substantial risk to the mother." Another board member who didn't want to be named said, "We only looked at scans which cannot predict the extent of disability the child will suffer." The decision couldn't be based on emotions or social reasons, the doctor said. Mukherji told TOI the pregnant woman didn't want a special needs child because she has seen a close family member suffer with physical and mental disabilities.
