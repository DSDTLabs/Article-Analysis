NEW DELHI: Just days after theft at deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s office in east Delhi’s Karkardooma, burglars broke into the office of   O P Sharma in the same area. 

 The thieves took away a computer, LCD TV and files kept there. The DVRs from CCTV cameras were also removed, just like in Sisodia’s office.
 
 Sharma said that the laptops contained sensitive data about Delhi assembly. Police said it is possible the same group of criminals might have committed both the thefts as the modus operandi seems similar.
 
 Police said that the office closed on Saturday night at 2am. The burglars had broken the locks and entered the office in early in the morning, without anyone noticing. Cops said that a nearby tea stall vendor noticed around 8am and informed the party workers when they arrived in the morning. 
 
 A case has been registered and probe is in progress but no arrest has been made so far. “The forensic team and sniffer dogs were taken to the spot but no headway was made,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Sharma, an MLA from Vishwas Nagar constituency, said that he was “surprised” by the theft and unable to suspect anyone. He told the cops that he got information from the party workers. “I dont know what to say except that they took away the electronic items,” he said.
