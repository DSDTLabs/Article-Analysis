Nagpur: Following reports of rats having gnawed away at the face of a suicide victim, the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) and Mayo hospital on Friday installed ultrasonic rat repellents in the mortuary and the cold storage inside it. The administration is also planning to buy better ultrasonic repellents in future. College dean Dr Anuradha Shrikhande told TOI that the college has asked the public works department to seal all the opening and hinges of the cold storage, and repair all the doors. “We are also planning a sensitization programme for the casualty medical officers (CMOs) to educate them to send the bodies properly wrapped and covered to the mortuary,” she said. Dr Shrikhande said that the hospital has called for company technicians to repair the gasket of the freezers in the cold storage.
