NEW DELHI: The Manila-based   ( ) said on Thursday that India is expected to achieve its previous growth projections of 7.4% in 2017 and 7.6% in 2018, largely driven by strong consumption.

 In a supplement to its   2017 report, the ADB upgraded its growth outlook in Asia from 5.7% to 5.9% for 2017 and from 5.7% to 5.8% for 2018. The smaller uptick in the 2018 rate reflects a cautious view on the sustainability of this export push.
 
 China, the world's second largest economy, is now expected to expand by 6.7% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018, well below India's rate of expansion.
 
 It said that the implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) in India is expected to improve the ease of doing business and facilitate growth in the medium term, though there may be some teething troubles as firms adjust to the new system.
 
 “Higher crop sowing, helped by a healthy monsoon, and an uptick in rural wage growth will bolster ru ral consumption, while urban consumption will get a boost from pay hikes for central and state government employees,“ it said.
 
 ADB said front-loading central government capital expenditure should further propel the pickup in growth in fiscal year 2017. The government had advanced the date of the budget presentation which has helped in spending funds on key projects from the beginning of the financial year in April.
 
 It said growth prospects in developing Asia for 2017 have improved on the back of stronger-than-expected export demand in the first quarter of this year.
