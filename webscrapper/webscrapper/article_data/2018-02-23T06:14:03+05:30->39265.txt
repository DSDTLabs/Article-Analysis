AHMEDABAD: A   rejected a closure report filed by the police and ordered   in the   against  ,  , and others.

 In 2012, an FIR was lodged at the court’s behest after a member of the economics faculty and the senate, Pradeep Prajapati, alleged that three persons including Trivedi misused their offices and gave away printing jobs for exam papers, answer sheets and other materials to Wilson Printcity Pvt Ltd between 2007 and 2011, causing the varsity a loss of Rs 1.3 crore. Prajapati also alleged that Trivedi and other officials split GU’s Rs 100-crore fixed deposit with the State Bank of India and deposited the money in separate banks, causing a loss of Rs 4 crore to the university.
 
 The court ordered a probe into the corruption charges against Trivedi, then university registrar M P Shah, development officer Vaishali Padhiyar and Wilson Printcity Pvt Ltd.
 
 After investigation, the police filed a closure report on the ground that no evidence could be gathered against Trivedi and two others to substantiate the charges. Prajapati filed a protest petition in the court against the summary report. It was also submitted that the university has also ordered an inquiry in this case. Prajapati’s protest petition was allowed on Wednesday and the court directed police to conduct the probe again and come up with a fresh report in six months’ time, said Prajapati’s advocate Sumit Sikarwar.
 
 In the past, police had filed an ‘A’ summary in an FIR accusing Trivedi of using castiest abuses against a Dalit lecturer. The court rejected it and Trivedi was later charge-sheeted and had to stand trial. Prajapati is a witness in this case.
