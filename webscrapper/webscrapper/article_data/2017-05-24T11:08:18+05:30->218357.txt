MANGALURU: Two youths from coastal Karnataka, who were stuck in Saudi Arabia after they were forced to work in a farm without salary for nearly five months, are all set to return to India. 

 Da modar Shettigar, 31, from Gandhinagar at   in Dakshina Kannada, and  , 25, from Mulki near Mangaluru, who went to Saudi on December 20, 2016 with visas to work as auto s pray painters, were forced to look after sheep and camels in a farm. The incident came to light after the duo launched a campaign through WhatsApp by contacting friends and mediapersons in   and Saudi Arabia. Indian Social   (ISF), an organization of Indians in Saudi Arabia, came forward to help the duo. 
 
  Puneeth told   on Tuesday that due to the efforts of ISF, they got their passports back which were with the sponsor in Saudi Arabia back through the Saudi Arabian Labour authorities. "First four months, we didn't get any job. When we informed the agency who recruited us in Mangaluru and Mumbai about our problems, they did not respond. Though we came here to work as auto spray painters, we were made to look after camels and sheep and our passports were with the sponsor. We were totally fed up and finally, sought the help of friends and the media through social media. Following this, ISF approached us," Puneeth said. 
 
  Damodar said: "ISF members took us to labour officials in Saudi Arabia. They listened to our grievances and offered help for our return journey. ISF members followed up the issue till the end. Now, all the official procedures have been cleared through the labour court. We have also got the exit permit. ISF members are trying to book flight tickets for us. We will be back soon." 
 
  TOI had highlighted the plight of the duo on May 16. The duo had filed a complaint with th e Indian embassy through MADAD (online Consular Grievances Management System of the  ) on April 4, 2017.
