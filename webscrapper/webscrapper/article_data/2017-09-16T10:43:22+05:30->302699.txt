INDORE: People from minority groups who have taken long term VISAs (LTV) can possess ration cards, driving licences, Aadhaar cards, special bank accounts and can also start businesses, the central government submitted before the Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court on Friday.

 The reply on behalf of the union of India, ministry of immigrations and foreign ministry was submitted before the division bench of Justice SC Sharma and Justice  , who directed the central government to supply a copy of the reply to the petitionerâ€™s counsel and granted them time to go through it and file rejoinders if necessary.
 
 The reply was given after a petition was filed by Vivek Khandelwal through advocate Anshumaan Shrivastav which challenged illegal citizenship to Pakistani nationals and sought action against their businesses and residences being constructed without proper permission.
 
 The reply submitted by additional solicitor general   and advocate   stated that as per a gazette notification passed by the state government on December 23, 2016, the district magistrates (DM) of Indore and Bhopal were empowered to grant citizenships to   from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who had applied for citizenship and had undergone thorough security checks.
 
 The DMs were also entrusted with the power to award long term VISAs (LTV) to immigrants under four categories. These categories included applications by members of minority groups in Pakistan, Pakistani women who had married Indian men, Indian women who had married Pakistani men and had returned back under cases of extreme compassion.
 
 The reply also annexed a notification passed by the home ministry on August 19, 2016 which granted many facilities to Hindu, Jain, Christian, Sikh, Parsi and Buddhist immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
 
 These facilities included opening an NRO bank account to purchase small dwelling units for self-occupation, issuing PAN cards and Aadhaar numbers. These facilities are subject to the declaration by Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Afghanistani nationals about their LTV status and the source of income for any purchases.
