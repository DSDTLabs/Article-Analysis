Don’t waste your vote. Please ensure that you go out and cast your   on Saturday and do not allow someone else to misuse your opportunity. Voting is one of the fundamental rights given to you in a democracy, so choose a candidate who will safeguard you in your area. It is very important for all of us to vote, especially the youth who have turned 18 or anyone who is voting for the first time. We have to ensure the percentage of voting grows higher. The onus is on us in choosing the right candidate and for that, one needs to be a responsible citizen and go out and vote. Since I turned 18, I’ve been voting regularly in  , which is the constituency where my residence is located. I recall my experience as a first-time voter. I was very excited that I had a mark on my finger to prove that I did vote. I have always had my personal choices when it comes to the elections. But the underlying idea behind it all is to vote for the right person who does good work, which should basically be the reason why you should vote for anyone.
