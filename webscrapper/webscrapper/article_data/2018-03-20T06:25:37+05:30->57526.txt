HYDERABAD: A person from Kerala, who landed at   from Dubai by using some other person’s passport was nabbed by security officials at the airport on Monday.

 The airport police said   had gone to Dubai in 2017 to work as a class IV employee and his passport was seized by his employer in Dubai. Rafeeq, who did not like the work environment in Dubai, decided return to India.
 
 
 As his Indian Passport was in possession of his employer in Dubai, Rafeeq bought a passport belonging to someone else through some agent in Dubai. The passport bought by Rafeeq was issued in the name of Anil Kumar. Rafeeq claimed to be Anil and managed to board the flight from Dubai and reached Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad. However, at Hyderabad airport, the immigration officials found something fishy during interrogation.
 
 “The passport on which Rafeeq had travelled from Dubai to Hyderabad has someone else’s photograph. This forced the airport staff to arrest him,” sub-inspector   said.
 
 The police is investigating about who sold the passport to Rafeeq in Dubai. After reaching Hyderabad, Rafeeq was supposed to go to Kerala. After his arrest. Cops booked Rafeeq under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Indian Passport Act.
 
 In the past there have been several similar instances where in Indian workers have resorted to illegal means to return to India as their passports are seized by their employers in foreign countries. The employers don’t return their passports, until the workers pay a huge amount to the employer.
