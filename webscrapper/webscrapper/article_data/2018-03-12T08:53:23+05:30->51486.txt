KALYAN: A 30-year-old   was on Sunday   by Thane rural police local crime branch unit for allegedly shooting dead   (26) and raping his girlfriend on the   road on Monday evening. Sanjay Narvade is a resident of Ulhasnagar.

 Dinkar and his girlfriend had gone for joyride near Nalindi village when Narvade tried to rob him and demanded his motorcycle key last Monday night. When he refused to hand over the keys, Narvade fired three rounds and raped his girlfriend at gunpoint. He then fled with her mobile phone. 
 
 Several teams were formed by Thane rural police and Thane city police to search for the accused. Sources said police checked old records in which robbers used guns and kept a watch on many, including Narvade, who had in a similar case shot at a person and robbed him. Police picked up Naravade from his residence on Sunday, when he confessed to this crime. A senior official from the local crime branch unit said they had arrested the accused, who confessed to the crime with an intention to rob, and a further probe is on.
 
 Police said Naravade claimed that Dinkar protested during the robbery bid, due to which he shot him.
 
 Naravade will be produced before court to seek his custody on Monday. Police have found that so far he was involved in only one robbery and firing case, while a probe is on to find out if he had robbed couples at an isolated sport on the Ambernath-Titwala route.
