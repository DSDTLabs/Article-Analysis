HYDERABAD: You wouldn't expect a diplomat to go about picking plastic from garbage, but Andrew Fleming, UK's deputy high commissioner to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad, did just that at Mailardevpally at Rajendranagar on Sunday morning. Fleming joined   sanitation workers in picking up plastic littered early in the morning. 

 
 
 Deputy Commissioner of Rajendranagar circle Vijaya Laxmi, Mailardevepally corporator T  , Rajendranagar circle AMOH, sanitary inspectors, and citizens also joined in the 'Beat Plastic Pollution' campaign. Several bagfuls of plastic were picked up. Fleming, dressed in shorts and a t-shirt arrived to be part of the campaign and spent several hours on the job.
 
 Plastic waste dumped on a piece of private land was segregated by officials and volunteers from 6 am to 10.30 am. Fleming said he was delighted to be part of the effort. "Say no to single use plastic," he said. 
 
 "As pledged, I joined a programme to help clean a neighbourhood and educate residents to lead greener lives," Fleming said. He also appreciated local 27-year-old GHMC corporator T Srinivas Reddy for his interest in the effort.
 
 Apart from plastic, paper and bottles, and mixed garbage was picked from the land. Segregated waste was then sold to   and the proceeds distributed among GHMC sanitation workers. ITC will further segregate and recycle it.
 
 While the initiative of officials and citizens coming together on   to clean up the surroundings is laudable, an official said penalties should be imposed on those who litter in public places with plastic and garbage and called for a ban on the manufacture of single use plastic bags.
