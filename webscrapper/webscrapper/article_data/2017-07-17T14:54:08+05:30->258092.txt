 Stating that the vessel can cause a bigger disaster if it capsizes, AAP member   said that the government did not listen to the Captain of Ports’ (CoP) warning.

Why did the government want to bring it out from MPT to the river when the river is closed for navigation for all barges?” Veigas asked, adding that the action was taken despite a circular from MPT and the  . 
 
 The party claimed that the incident is a repeat of   Pride grounding in Candolim, which remained struck on the beach for 15 years. “The incident will again bring a bad name to Goa in the shipping industry. The ropes connecting the vessel to the tug boats snapped when it was being moved out of the MPT. That should have been taken as a signal to not move it further,” Veigas said.
