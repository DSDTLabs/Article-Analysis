 I have always wanted to be a homeopath. As a 18-year-old, I researched about   and was impressed with its patient-centric approach. I even managed to convince my parents about my love for homeopathy and they didn’t seem too upset with me for not pursuing allopathy. But after completing my four-and-a-half-year-long degree, I felt I needed some   on emergency medicine. 
 
 If a patient who has suffered a massive fall is brought to me, how should I treat him? What about a drowning case? As a homeopath, patients with chronic conditions may land up at my clinic after trying out every other ‘pathy’. It is wellknown that chronic patients do well with homeopathy. But what if a patient who has fallen from a tree is brought to me? I hence enrolled for the Lifesupporters Institute of   course in emergency medicine. In the last five months, I have learnt various modes of intervention needed to resuscitate an emergency case. One shouldn’t only think about fractures of the limbs for a fall patient, but even consider spine injuries. 
 
 These are points I am learning to become a more wholesome healthcare provider. Such courses expose youth to difference concepts. I may take up a job in an intensive care unit, but I would like to open a homeopathy clinic where I can practise my skills.
