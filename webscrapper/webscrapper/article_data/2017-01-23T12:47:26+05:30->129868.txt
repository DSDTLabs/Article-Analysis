 The Indo-Swiss pair took just 54 minutes to get the better of Reid and Dellacqua 6-2, 6-3 in the second round encounter.

 Leading 5-2, Paes and Hingis broke Dellacqua again to pocket the first set with a near-flawless show in 24 minutes.
 
 Paes and Hingis' domination could be gauged from the fact that they committed just one unforced error in the first set as against seven by their opponents.
