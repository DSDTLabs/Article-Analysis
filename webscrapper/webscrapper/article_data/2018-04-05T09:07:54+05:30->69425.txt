MUMBAI: The   process put in place by the Indian cricket board to sell the bilateral rights over the next five years under three separate packages has turned out to be a significant boost to the property this week. The online bidding process which began on Tuesday at 2 pm at an accumulated reserve price of Rs 4134 Cr, rose to Rs 4442 Cr by the end of Tuesday and resumed at 11 am on Wednesday only to conclude yet again at 6 pm at a whopping Rs 6032.50 Cr. The process will once again resume at 11 am on Thursday and could conclude on the same day.

 
 The first two days of the online auction have seen the per-match value of the property – at Rs 59.142 Cr – skyrocketting past the per-match value of the   (IPL) – at Rs 54 Cr – the value that Star India Pvt. Ltd paid   in September last year. BCCI’s former Chief Operating Officer (COO)   had first suggested the idea of an e-auction process and had remained the frontman in advocating the need to adopt the use of technology in bidding of such high-profile properties. The cricket board had, in fact, resisted this move last year when the IPL rights had gone on sale, only to be convinced this time around.
 
 “Well, the BCCI can certainly thank him for first bringing up the idea of an e-auction. The difference between the top two bidders is hardly Rs 2.09 cr. That’s how fierce the bidding has been,” an industry expert said.
 
 Given that the sum of individual bids, during the IPL auction, had remained only 3% less than the winning global consolidated bid of Rs 16,347.5 Cr submitted by  , it can only be left to imagination if an e-auction would’ve fetched the BCCI more than what it actually did last year. At the current exchange value, Rs 6528 will remain the billion-dollar mark and it should be no surprise if the ongoing bidding goes past that figure.
