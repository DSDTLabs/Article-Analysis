AHMEDABAD:   issued notice to the Centre and a member judge of the Ahmedabad bench of the   (CAT), M Nagrajan, on a petition filed by an   ( ) employee who sought an inquiry and action against the judge on the basis of various complaints.

 AIR employee Ravindra Parmar has been contesting a case before the CAT against his transfer. He said he has been hounded by his department for his efforts to check corruption. He said he has been transferred 10 times in the last nine years and challenged one of these transfer orders before CAT.
 
 Parmar’s case is that a division bench in the CAT granted a stay on his transfer, but judge Nagrajan vacated the stay in an autocratic manner. He made various complaints to the central government, which did not act. He finally moved the HC last year with the complaint that the   worked in a partial, autocratic and vengeful manner.
 
 Parmar sought a transfer of the CAT judge and constitution of another bench to dispose of his case expeditiously. He also demanded action for contempt of the court against officials of   on the grounds that they allegedly misled the CAT as well as the HC. He also claimed that under pressure from Nagrajan, lawyers gave up his case and he was compelled to appear as party-in-person.
 
 This matter will be heard further on May 3.
 
 Before Parmar approached the HC, an advocate practising at the CAT, Sunita Chaturvedi, demanded an inquiry and action against the judicial officer for his alleged misconduct as a judge. She demanded his removal on the ground of “incompetence”. Chaturvedi alleged that CAT judicial member M Nagarajan is “incompetent” in his work. She said Nagarajan acts as both the judge and lawyer in certain cases, and even adjudicates on his own drafted petitions.
