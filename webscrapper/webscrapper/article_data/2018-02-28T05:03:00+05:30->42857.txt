GHAZIABAD: The GDA is planning to construct an   in the heart of city in  , an area infamous for frequent traffic jams. The development authority has asked the   (CPWD) to prepare the design and the detailed project report in a week, following which it will be sent to the state government for vetting and approval.

 The proposed elevated road will be a shorter version of UP Gate-Rajnagar extension elevated road and will be only 2km long. “Like the UP Gate-Rajnagar extension elevated road (whose length is 10.3km), the new elevated rod will be built on a single pier. It will be 2km in length extending from Ghanta Ghar to Bhatia, which is in the middle of city,” said S S Verma, superintendent engineer of GDA. “The proposed elevated road will go a long way in reducing traffic congestion in this area, which frequently witnesses traffic jams throughout the day,” added Verma.
 
 According to the survey, about 2.5 lakh vehicles, mostly light motor vehicles and two-wheelers, pass through this section everyday. On the other hand, half of this narrow road is encroached upon by illegal parking by shopkeepers and their customers. 
 
 “The elevated structure will enable vehicles to pass through the area unhindered from Ghanta Ghar to Rakesh Marg while the space under the elevated road can be used to create a parking lot,” said Verma.
 
 The estimated cost of the project has been pegged at Rs 200 crore and the GDA will bear the cost from its infrastructure fund. “A CPWD team recently visited the spot and we have asked them to prepare the DPR and design in one week. We will then seek sanction from the state government and I hope that we can start work on this stretch in July,” said Verma.
