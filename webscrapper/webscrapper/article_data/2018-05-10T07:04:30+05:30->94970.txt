HYDERABAD: This   could turn out to be the hottest Muslim month of fasting since 1985. It was 33 years ago that Ramzan in Hyderabad had the most number of summer days. The   ( ) has predicted that summer 2018 is warmer than that of 1985. Since the   is based on lunar calculations - 11 days short of the solar year - Muslim festivals coincide with solar calendar once in a cycle of every 33 years. This Ramzan is a repetition of the 1985 Ramzan with the summer days almost coinciding. 

 
 The fasting duration this year in Hyderabad will range from 15 hours and 18 minutes (May 16) to 15 hours and 33 minutes (June 14).
 
  It will be a testing time of spiritual and physical endurance for the devout as the average mean temperature in the city during May is 33 degrees C (often touching 44.5 degrees C). In June the average temperature is 29.3 degrees C (often touching 45.5 degrees C). 
 
 With Hyderabad shorn of the tree cover, the feel-like temperature could be even more. Ramzan in India is likely to begin on May 16 and end on June 14. The   on May 16 is at 4.24 am and Iftar is at 6.42 pm. On June 14 the Sahar is at 4.19 am and Iftar at 6:52 pm.
