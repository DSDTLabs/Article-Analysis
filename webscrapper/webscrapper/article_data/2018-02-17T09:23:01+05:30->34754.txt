AHMEDABAD: Member of the Narmada Control Authority (Environment and Rehabilitation),  , has warned that if proper conservation methods are not employed, the scarcity of water could have huge socio-economic consequences. At the India Environment Festival organized at   in Vastrapur,   said that in 1955 per capita availability of water in the country was 5,000 cubic metres per person. It has now reduced to 1,500 and in 10 years, Ahmad fears that availability will dip to 1,000 cubic metres.

 He warned of an impending water crisis if as a society we do not come forward to save this precious resource. “|I recall how I had once visited the Rajkot area to assess the water situation there. In the middle of a meeting, the Rajkot collector and few other officials had to rush to a location. When they returned to the meeting, they informed me that a water riot had broken out over the issue of drinking water supply,” says Ahmad. 
 
 He later explained how of the 24 river basins, there have been instances of water conflicts in 12 which have required intervention. Ahmad added that nearly 45% of the country’s population lives beside the Krishna, Kaveri, Ganga, Jamuna rivers and that just three rivers — Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Indus — carry nearly 70% of the country’s waters. 
 
 “We have to preserve our groundwater as it is our lifeline. We should only use it if we have been able to replenish it,” said Ahmad. He recalled from a recent meeting in Maharashtra’s Nandurbar district, where in 11 villages the groundwater level had gone down from 200 feet to 1,000 feet. 
 
 “The groundwater dipped despite there being a law that made such groundwater extraction illegal. This calls for collective responsibility,” says Ahmad. In  , the Narmada rehabilitation and afforestation activities have shown how development and ecology preservation can go hand in hand.
