BATHINDA: Jalalabad assembly constituency in Fazilka district, represented by deputy chief minister  , is the only assembly segment in Punjab from where two sitting MPs are in a direct contest with a former MP. Both the   and   have fielded their sitting MPs   Bittu, 41, and Bhagwant Mann, 43. Sukhbir is a former Lok Sabha MP from neighbouring Faridkot.

 Apart from them, three more former MPs from the Congress — Captain  , Navjot Singh Sidhu and Vijayinder Singla, are also vying to gain entry into Punjab legislative assembly. Thus, two sitting and four former MPs are trying their luck this time.
 
 Both Amarinder and Sidhu had represented Amritsar in the Lok Sabha and while Bhagwant is the MP from Sangrur, the parliamentary constituency represented by Singla before him. Bittu represents Ludhiana in the lower house of Parliament.
 
 AAP was the first to announce the candidature of its MP Bhagwant Maan from Jalalabad on November 20, 2016. Sukhbir’s candidature was announced on January 5 and on Monday, the Congress fielded Bittu, making it a triangular contest.
 
 Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Badal said, “Bhagwant and Bittu have been forced to contest from Jalalabad to stop Sukhbir Badal. However, both will forfeit their deposits. If they are really serious to take on Sukhbir, they should contest after resigning from their seats in Parliament.”
 
 Satirist-turned-politician Bhagwant Mann claimed, “I wanted to give Sukhbir Badal a run for his money. He will now feel the pinch as it seems that entire Jalalabad wants to adopt AAP.”
 
 When contacted, Bittu said, “Fight at Jalalabad will finish off both Akali Dal and AAP. Jalalabad will pave the way for a Congress government led by Amarinder Singh in Punjab. For me Jalalabad now has become a do-or-die battle.”
