Ahmedabad: Be it flat cash discounts or festive muhurats, nothing appears to have helped car dealers to cash in on Dussehra this year. Thanks to the implementation of the GST and subdued purchase sentiment, car sales on Dussehra were about average and lower by 15-20% compared to last year’s Dussehra sales.

 “While our targets will be met, deliveries are not as high as they were last year,” said a Volkswagen dealer. “Despite launching a new model, the price rise after the GST implementation has not gone down well with consumers. Prices on all our models have gone up from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1.75 lakh.”
 
 Some 3,000 cars rolled out of city’s showrooms on Saturday. A number of people made purchases on Ashtami and Navami muhurats because they consider it inauspicious to purchase metal on Saturday. “We offered cash discounts up to Rs 50,000 on certain models and other offers as well,” said Surendra Sharma, a dealer of Hyundai motors. “Sales fared decently and we hope to meet our targets.”
