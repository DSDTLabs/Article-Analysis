MANGALURU: Former Union minister   termed that senior Congress leader S M Krishna had made "big mistake'' by resigning from the party. However, Poojary said he was not given a fair treatment by the party and was sidelined too. "Whatever Krishna spoke during the press conference was the truth,” Poojary said recalling the achievements of S M Krishna as a leader. 

 Poojary, former KPCC president, told the former union minister: You (Krishna) should not have resigned (from Congress). You have committed a mistake. It is not right on your part to leave the party. We could have fought together to save the party.” 
 
 The veteran Congress leader also pleaded Krishna not to join any other party. "Don’t join any other political party. Let us fight together against the arrogance of chief minister Siddaramaiah. The CM’s arrogance is crossing all limits and he has become a ‘Shani’ to Congress in Karnataka. Congress can be saved in Karnataka only if Siddaramaiah goes,” Poojary lambasted. 
 
 Recalling a recent meeting of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi with S M Krishna, Poojary said the party high command had requested the former chief minister not to leave the party. “You have sufficient time to meet Sonia Gandhi and take back your resignation. She will give you another opportunity,” Poojary said not clarifying on what he meant by ``another opportunity”. 
 
 Further, Poojary warned S M Krishna that Opposition parties were waiting for an opportunity to finish him politically. “You may be an asset for the opposition parties, but don’t forget that your future will be at stake if you join other party. If BJP has so much love towards you, then let them make you the President of India,” he added. 
 
 Poojary opined the resignation of Krishna is a big blow to the Congress, not only in Karnataka, but also in the entire nation. “Krishna’s resignation may trigger a big crisis in the party as he is a seasoned politician, who is very well-mannered and speak no nonsense.
