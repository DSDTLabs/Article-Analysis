HYDERABAD: Expelled Telangana Congress legislators   and A   on Thursday approached the Hyderabad High Court challenging their expulsion from the Assembly and urging the court to restrain the Election Commission from declaring their constituencies —   and Alampur — as vacant.

 In their plea, they contended that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is angry about their aggressive approach in questioning the state on its failures and hence chose this legislative route to get rid of them citing a fictitious attack on the   chairman Swamy Goud. They refuted the allegation that they had injured Swamy Goud’s eye by throwing a headphone and demanded that the authorities produce video footage to prove their claim.
 
 They wondered that if the TRS’ contention was true that they threw the headphone during the governor’s address to the joint session of the Assembly and Council, how come the Speaker and   chairman were seen accompanying the governor up to the car to see him off that day.
 
 “We were not notified. Nor was any explanation sought from us. We were expelled from the Assembly and now efforts are on to hold by-elections to our constituencies,” they said.
 
 They also contended that when the governor addresses a joint session, the Houses cannot be termed as Assembly and Council in technical terms. Only when these Houses are conducting their business that the Speaker and Council chairman get the power to act in their official capacity. Thus, the powers of the Speaker cannot be invoked for omissions and commissions during the governor’s address, they argued.
 
 Justice B Siva Sankara Rao assured the Congress leaders’ counsel,  , that the case would be taken up on Friday.
