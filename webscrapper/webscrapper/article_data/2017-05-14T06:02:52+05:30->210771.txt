 Explaining the link between farming and the reduced number of rapes, the minister said farmers seldom get time to abuse women.
 
 “He will be busy with farming and won’t get time even to think of rape,” he said.
 
 Advocating the need for the society to practise self-control, Sudhakaran suggested that the local self-government institutions should intervene and teach people the need for self-control.
 
 The minister, however, sounded sure that the existing mechanisms could not make people to exercise self-control.
 
 “The state government and police alone cannot make the society to exercise restraint if the people are not ready to understand its relevance,” he said.
 
 He blamed the media for the “rumours that   is not safe for women and children. It’s wrong,” Sudhakaran said.
 
 According to the state police’s provisional crime statistics, as many as 16,960 cases of crime against women and children, including 2,568 rapes, were reported in 2016.
 
 Of the total rape cases in 2016, women were targeted in 1,644 incidents while children in 924 cases reported in the state, higher than the reported 1,263 and 720, respectively, in 2015.
