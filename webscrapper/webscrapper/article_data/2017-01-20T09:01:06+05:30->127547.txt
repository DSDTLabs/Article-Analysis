After finally getting hold of  , the ‘kiss-and-run’ prankster on  , the   is now trying to verify his claim that the girls in the video were his friends and knew about the prank. But they are having a tough time with it. 

  A   official told us, "When we questioned those girls, they told us that they were aware of the prank video. However, they say that they didn’t know that the video would be uploaded on YouTube. Now, we are seeking legal advice on whether Section 354 of the IPC (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) will be applicable in this situation or not."
 
  The girls' family members had earlier visited the Crime Branch office in Daryaganj, where they were told that the girls' statement would have to be recorded. The girls, who are based in Gurgaon and Delhi, were questioned at their homes.
 
  Initially, a case was registered against Sumit under Section 354 of the IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form). However, now, the police will take action only after getting legal advice, which will take another two-three days. The police official added, "Sumit and   (Sumit’s friend and cameraman) told us that the girls were their friends and knew that the prank video would be later uploaded on YouTube. But now, the statements of the girls contradict the claims made by these two."
 
  The Crime Branch officials are also considering questioning the girls, Sumit and Kadyan together. An investigating officer told us, "If needed, all four of them will be questioned together to get more clarity."
 
  Earlier, the police had told us that even if the girls knew about the video, they could still charge Sumit with publishing obscene material online and engaging in obscenity in public places.
