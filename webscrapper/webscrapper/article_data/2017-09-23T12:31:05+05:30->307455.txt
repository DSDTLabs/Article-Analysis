SURAT: Deeply concerned with the sharp fall in business of man-made fabrics (MMF) and the increasing joblessness in in the city, the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association ( ) has sent emails to prime minister,  , Goods and Service Tax (GST) council members and around 250 MPs from different states to resolve the issues related to GST on Friday. 

 In the email communication, FOSTTA has raised serious concerns about the sharp fall in business turnover of traders and increasing number of jobless workers in the textile markets following implementation of GST. 
 
 According to FOSTTA, the manufacturing of grey fabric has dropped drastically from 4 crore metre per day to 1.5 crore metres per day, a 50 per cent reduction in the supply of grey fabrics from Bhiwandi, Malegaon, Erode, Tripura, Ichhalkaranji etc., small traders having turnover below Rs 70 lakh per year are experiencing difficulty in sending their goods to other states. 
 
 Traders stated that the implementation of GST has led to many problems. The grey fabric manufacturers are not giving goods on credit and that they are asking to pay cash. This has created a lot of problems to the small traders who can’t arrange for hard cash. 
 
 Talking to TOI, FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal said, “The supply of sari and dress material from Surat has been reduced to less than 30%. The small traders in the markets have literally stopped buying raw material for the want of cash money. This has hugely impacted the textile markets.” 
 
 Agarwal added, “The FOSTTA has sent emails to the PM, FM, GST council members and 250 MPs from different states. We want them to hear our problems and provide us some solution. Otherwise, the markets will have to be shut for an indefinite period.”
