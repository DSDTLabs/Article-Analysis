NAVI MUMBAI: It’s been almost four years since the   was constructed, but it is yet to get basic equipment such as fire tenders as well as manpower.

 The fire station, located a few kilometres from the proposed international airport, does not have essential equipment to meet a fire emergency. 
 
 Built by   at a cost of Rs 6.22 crore, the fire station also has staff quarters and offices in it. However, the fire station will not serve any purpose in case of a fire in the area, say residents.
 
 Ulwe resident Sonal Patil said, “The fire brigade does not have equipment and fire tenders. What is the use of building such a big building when the fire brigade cannot even tackle a fire in the node sans equipment. Cidco should provide all required fire-fighting system.”
 
 Construction work of the fire station was started in 2011 and completed in 2013 on a plot of 8,162 sq m in sector 19. The fire station building comprises 36 flats for the firemen, four officers’ flats and offices. 
 
 The building also has a smoke drill tower besides a fuel store room and parking for five fire vehicles.
 
 A Ulwe node Cidco official said, “Currently the station complex is used for training over 50 staff regularly. The building has been handed over to the fire brigade long ago.”
 
  Atish Thakur, another resident said, “A large number of multi-storied buildings have come up in the node. However, in case of a fire, citizens will have to depend upon fire teams coming from other nodes.”
 
 Cidco senior PRO, Mohan Ninawe said, “The fire station is ready and staff recruitment and procurement of fire-fighting equipment are at an advanced stage.”
 
 Cidco chief fire officer was unavailable for comment while the deputy chief fire officer declined to comment. 
 
 Other Cidco fire stations are located in New Panvel, Kalamboli and   with a staff strength of around 35 in each.
