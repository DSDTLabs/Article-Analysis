Vadodara: A judicial magistrate’s court has ordered the Government Railway Police (GRP) to submit its report within 45 days regarding their investigations into the stampede that led to the death of a citizen at railway station during actor Shah Rukh Khan’s film promotion on January 23.

 Youth Congress worker Jitendra Solanki alias Pappu had filed an application in court on February 17 seeking direcitons to the police for filing a complaint against Khan. Solanki said that he went to court since the police did not file a complaint even after he had given an application to the superintendent of police, Western Railway and railway policer inspector regarding the incident.
 
 On Thursday, judicial magistrate Priyanka Lal ordered GRP to file a report according to section 210 of criminal procedure code. The court has asked the police that a report of its inquiry and investigations that they have conducted until now be submitted.
 
 “We have not yet received the copy of court’s order but our investigation is on. We had even summoned officials of event management company that had organized Khan’s train tour but they have not yet turned up to give their statement,” said Tarun Barot, deputy superintendent of police, Western Railway.
 
 A city-based politician Farid Khan Pathan had died of heart attack after he got trapped in the mob that had turned up at Vadodara railway station to catch a glimpse of Khan who was travelling by train to promote his film. Thousands of fans had mobbed the railway station and rushed towards the moving train, forcing the cops to resort to lathi-charge. Some fans had also suffered injuries in the incident.
 
 On February 10, a Mumbai-based advocate and activist Abha Singh had met GRP officials in the city and urged them to file an FIR against Khan and the company that was handling promotion of his film.
