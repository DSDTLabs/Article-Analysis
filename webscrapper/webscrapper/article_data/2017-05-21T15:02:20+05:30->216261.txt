PELLING (Sikkim): Amidst the ongoing unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, Home Minister   said on Sunday that the NDA government would find a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue.

 Addressing a public reception in this western part of the Himalayan state, Singh said Pakistan has been trying to destabilise India by fomenting trouble in Kashmir.
 
 "But I want to tell all of you that our government will find a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue," he said. "Kashmir is ours, Kashmiris are ours and   is also ours. We will find a permanent solution to Kashmir," he added.
 
 The home minister's statement assumes significance as it comes at a time the Kashmir valley has been witnessing widespread unrest since April 9 when the bypoll to the   seat was held. Eight people were killed in firing by security forces on the day and the turnout was a mere 7.14 per cent.
 
 Students in large numbers have hit the streets, staging protests against alleged atrocities by the security forces. Last year, around 80 people lost their lives in the unrest following the killing of   militant  .
 
 Referring to the 2014 swearing-in ceremony of the   government, the home minister said leaders of all neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, were invited to show that the new government wanted to have friendly relations with all countries.
 
 He, however, said there had been no change in Pakistan's attitude towards India and it wanted to destabilise India.
 
 "We hope that Pakistan will change. If it does not change, we will have to change them," he said.
 
 The home minister is on a three-day visit to Sikkim during which he attended a conference of Himalayan states to review the security situation and development activities along the Sino-Indian border.
 
 He had also visited the Nathu La border post, besides visiting a few posts of Indo-Tibetan   and SSB along the Sino-Indian and Indo-Nepal border respectively.
