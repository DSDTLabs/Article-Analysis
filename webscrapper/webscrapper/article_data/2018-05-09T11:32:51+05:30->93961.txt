JAISALMER: Not a single   from western Rajasthan attended a meeting held on Saturday by north western railway committee for talks on development of rails, running new rails and for solving problems of passengers.

 Out of 25, only 14 MPs reached to take part in the meeting. Absentees included Jodhpur MP and union agriculture state minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Jaisalmer Barmer MP Col. Sonaram Choudhary, Rajya Sabha member Narayan Lal Pancharia, Jalore MP Devji Patel, Pali MP PP Choudhary, Rajsamand MP Gopal Singh etc. Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot attacking on six MPs of Jodhpur division raised question on their claims of being a true guard of people. Gehlot in two tweets has asked this question to six MPs.
 
 NWR general manager and DRM and all the section heads were present in the meeting.
 
 According to sources, NWR had informed MPs about the meeting on time but MPs of Jaisalmer-Barmer, Pali, Jodhpur, Jalore, Rajsamand did not show up. On the other hand, other MPs took part in the meeting and discussed on increasing facilities and bringing new trains and other issues.
 
 Former CM Ashok Gehlot has remarked that it is very unfortunate that   MPs are not taking any interest in problems of their areas. Jalore MP has not demanded any train. Despite converting to broad gauge in Jalore, there are not sufficient trains. There is dearth of trains going to south.
 
 Gehlot said Col Choudhary is misguiding people on   rail line. For a long time people are demanding to regularize Bikaner-Dadar train for Mumbai and trains for Bangalore and Chennai and new trains. Despite Samdadi-Bhildi train route being converted to broad gauge, passenger trains have not been increased. During the congress rule, BJP MPs used to come on tracks on train problems and today they have not reached the meeting to put their problems which his quite unfortunate.
