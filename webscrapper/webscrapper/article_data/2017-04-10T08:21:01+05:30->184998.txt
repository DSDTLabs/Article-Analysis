LUCKNOW: In the spate of debit card   cases, seven new complaints were lodged with the Hazratganj-based cyber cell of Lucknow police on Friday and Saturday. The total amount stolen from the group of seven stands close to Rs 4.40 lakh. Linked to Gujarat-based miscreants, transactions in all seven cases were facilitated in Vadodara.

 More than 60 persons lodged complaints of card cloning with city police in the past one week. Modus operandi in all these cases has been the same and police are coordinating with their counterparts in Gujarat to get more details.
 
 Five of the seven victims are government employees. Sub-inspector Awadesh Pal Singh, posted at   lost Rs 2 lakh, while woman constable Prerna Pandey posted at GRP headquarters in Indira Bhawan lost Rs 1.99 lakh. Jagdish Kumar, posted at DRM office in Hazratganj was duped of Rs 25,000. Constable Harendra Kaushik, posted in police lines found Rs 1.60 lakh deducted from his bank account fraudulently.
 
 Another government employee, Krishanagar resident Jyotasana Singh was conned of Rs 20,000. Kiran Singh and Mehta Singh were two other victims who stay in   and were duped of Rs 20,000 and Rs 15,000, respectively.
 
 “A person can only withdraw Rs 50,000 from debit card in a day. Miscreants used cloned cards for four to five days in a row,” said VVS Sirohi in charge of cyber cell, adding that earlier, scores of cloning cases were reported to the cell. Despite having multiple mobile numbers, the three police personnel did not use their mobile number registered with the bank frequently, said the cyber cell in charge. 
 
 Fraudulent transactions have been carried out from two locations in Vadodara, namely Susan Circle and Pratapganj. Though debit card remained in possession of bank customers in Lucknow, money was removed from the bank accounts since April 1.
