THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The vigilance special court here on Friday admitted a petition filed against head of the Vigilance and   (VACB), Loknath Behera, which alleged corruption behind his directive to paint police stations and offices of circle inspectors and DSPs using a particular brand of paint. The judge has directed the   to file a report before May 20. 

 The judge issued the directive after hearing the petition filed by  , a regular litigant in the vigilance court. Vigilance legal advisor C C   stated before the court that the decision to provide a common colour code to all the stations was made at a national-level meeting. Behera was merely accepting the suggestion put forward by the  .
 
 However, vigilance judge A   asked whether Behera was capable of issuing such an order on April 28 as the Supreme Court had already nullified the government order appointing him as the state police chief on April 24. 
 
 The judge sought to know why Behera specified a particular brand. How can one say there was no corruption involved, he asked. The judge also observed that the uniform colour code must first be established in ration shops, where essential commodities were sold. The court will continue hearing on May 20 on the basis of a report to be filed by the VACB.
