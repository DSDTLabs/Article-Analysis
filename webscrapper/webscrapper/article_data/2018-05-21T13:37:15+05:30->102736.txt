KANYAKUMARI: In view of the railway minister’s visit to   and Kerala on June 9 and 10, the Kanyakumari District Railway Users’ Association has made an appeal to the ministry to announce extension of any one of the Trivandrum–Mangalore daily trains to   or Nagercoil.

 The association stated that this is a long pending demand as at present there is no direct daily overnight train service between Nagercoil and Mangalore. The association claimed that there are a large number of people from this region working in the unorganised sector in and around Shoranur, Kasaragod, Kozhikode and Mangalore.
 
 They are finding it difficult to visit their hometown and return to work, the association said, and added that people travelling from Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts to the above mentioned regions are facing difficulties as they have to go to Trivandrum to board one of the three daily evening services between Trivandrum and Mangalore (train no.s 16347/16348, 16603/16604 and 16629/16630).
