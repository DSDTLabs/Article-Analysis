NEW DELHI: A rise in spending pushed up the Centreâ€™s   to 96.1% of the   estimate for the current year, despite a sharp decline in   expenditure during the month. Latest data released by the Controller General of Accounts estimated fiscal deficit at Rs 5.25 lakh crore during April-August, compared to the target of Rs 5.46 lakh crore for 2017-18. At the end of the first five months of 2016-17, fiscal deficit was estimated at 76.4% of the annual target.

 The government has budgeted for fiscal deficit of 3.2% of the GDP for the current financial year, compared to 3.5% last year. The government has said that it is on course to meet the target. Top officials said that the high fiscal deficit till the end of August was due to frontloading of spending due to the early passage of the Budget, while revenue will flow in later in the year.
 
 So far this year, Rs 1.48 lakh crore of extra spending has taken place, an officer said. Total spending till August this year was estimated at Rs 9.5 lakh crore, compared to a shade over Rs 8 lakh crore in the corresponding period last year.
 
 While capital expenditure, which results in asset creation, was 20% higher at Rs 1.09 lakh crore, there was a decline in August when it fell 28% to Rs 14,522 crore. Officials said that this may be due to seasonal factors and the government was committed to boosting public spending to make for slow private investment. Compared to April-August 2016, when capital expenditure was 37% of the Budget estimate, so far this year, it was estimated at 35.5% of the target.
