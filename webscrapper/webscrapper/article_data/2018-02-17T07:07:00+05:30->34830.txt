GHAZIABAD: An FIR has been registered against two   and a compounder of a private hospital here for allegedly injecting a wrong medicine to a woman, causing failure of both her kidneys. 

 The incident had taken place in August 2005, but the woman approached police only in 2016 after she failed to get any response from the doctors who had promised her treatment.
 
 The FIR mentions two doctors and a compounder of a private hospital in Nehru Nagar. They have been booked under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC.
 
 Anju Kumar (36), a resident of  , said in her complaint that she had delivered a baby boy at the hospital on August 15, 2005, through a C-section. Four days later, an injection was allegedly given to her by the hospital compounder in the presence of the two doctors.
 
 “I started writhing in pain soon after the injection was administered. My body had swollen and the doctors told me that I was suffering from some sort of infection. They kept giving me medicines, and after 10 days, referred me to another private hospital, where I underwent 35 dialyses over the next three months,” said Anju, whose husband Naveen Kumar runs a general store.
 
 “At my home, I was confined to the bed for almost two years. The doctors had promised me treatment and so, I did not lodge any complaint. Over the past 13 years, we have incurred a debt of Rs 22 lakh,” she added.
 
 The woman said she had approached the then SSP in 2016, and an inquiry was conducted by a CO-level officer. Later, she lodged a complaint with the district magistrate. One of the doctors said the allegations by Anju were baseless.“She has been trying to extract money from us,” he added.
