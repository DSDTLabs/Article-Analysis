AMRITSAR: To help the English-speaking younger Thai Sikh generation imbibe Gurbani (hymns) and teachings of Sikh Gurus, community members of   have started inviting Sikh preachers from the UK instead of India since the former preach both in English and Punjabi.

 While talking to TOI on Wednesday, a prominent Thai Sikh activist, Charanjit Singh Kalra, said from this year they had started inviting UK-based Sikh preachers and their groups, including Nirvair Khalsa Jatha, Veer Manpreet Singh, Bhai Satpal Singh, Bibi Avneet Kaur and  , to Thailand to deliver sermons, explain Gurbani and preach the teachings of Gurus to the young Sikh generation of Thailand. “Sikh youths here want to understand Gurbani and know the teachings of Sikh Gurus as enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, but they want someone to preach and make them understand in English and not in Punjabi since they don’t understand Punjabi very well. So we have started inviting Sikh preachers from the UK,” said another Sikh Thai national Dalvir Singh Narula.
 
 Thai Sikhs not only have their Sikh names but they have also adopted Thai names for the sake of their Thai identity and keep themselves on official government records. In Thailand, the Sikh population is spread in various parts, including Pattaya, Phuket, Hatyai, Ubo, Udorn, Pattani, Chang Mi and Chiang Rai. 
 
 Charanjit whose Thai name is   informed that a few Sikh preachers take their fee, which range from Rs 2 lakh-Rs 3 lakh for three to four days, while a few preach the teachings of Sikh Gurus and explain Gurbani in English as ‘sewa’ (voluntary service). “Sikh preachers from the UK say every line in both English and Punjabi, whereas preachers from Punjab hold discourses only in Punjabi,” he maintained. Charanjit further said there was immense demand of English speaking Sikh preachers in South-East Asia, especially in countries having sizeable Sikh population, including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.
