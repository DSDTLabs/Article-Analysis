CHENNAI: The seizure of 40kg gold worth Rs 12.6 crore, in which Chinese nationals  , 29, and Haunguang, 34, coming from Hong Kong were arrested last week by  , has probably helped intelligence agencies stumble upon a link to a new smuggling racket. The huge seizure has set the network of officials buzzing, as nationals from China have never been arrested before at Chennai airport.

 The gold was recovered from hand luggage left behind in the airport’s toilet. Identified through surveillance footage, customs officials picked up the duo from a city hotel the same evening, and are in remand. Customs officials chose to be tight-lipped about the case as investigations are under-way to uncover the network. 
 
 Data sourced through RTI shows 551 foreign nationals were apprehended at   between April 2014 and February 2018. Of them, more than half were from Sri Lanka, while the rest were from south-east Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Myanmar. In a handful of cases, French, British, Canadians and one Taiwanese were found carrying gold more than the permitted limit. 
 
 However, not even a single Chinese was apprehended, according to the data. Experts in the intelligence establishment confirmed that prior to 2014 as well, there had been no evidence of Chinese involvement in gold smuggling rackets. 
 
 Observers in the intelligence agencies say that existing kingpins might have delegated the work to Chinese to dodge an unsuspecting customs. Sources said that based on preliminary investigations, the duo arrested last week were on their first trip to Chennai. The seizure’s links with drug mafia operating in south-east Asia has not been ruled out either. While drugs like meth and pseudo-ephedrine are smuggled out, payment for these are done through gold smuggled into India, say sources.
 
 “Involvement of airport insiders also cannot be ruled out. Last year, a few contract employees were found helping gold carriers,” said a officer on the case.
