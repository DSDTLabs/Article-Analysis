HYDERABAD: Refusing to accept the argument that there is a BJP wave in the country,   said the presence of strong regional parties in states like Telangana will not allow the   to roll on.

 Explaining the political dynamics in the country, the minister spelled out BJP's `weaknesses' and gave it slim chances to expand its wings in the souther n part of the country. According to KTR, BJP failed to make any serious inroads in southern India except Karnataka as regional parties are strong in Telangana, AP, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Karnataka, the BJP was able to come to power only because the regional party (JD(S)) was not strong.“I don't think the BJP's juggernaut will continue in south India. The people of this region are different in many aspects and there are strong regional parties in power“.
 
 Once people experience the benefits of a strong regional party, they would never go for national par ties. “I can promise you that“ KT Rama Rao said and detailed the unsuccessful efforts of the saffron party in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Telangana.
 
 To another query that the BJP participated in the   and, therefore, claims to be   and an alternative to the TRS, KTR said: “Everyone was part of the Telangana agitation, show me who was not?“. He declared that people will always rally behind regional parties with efficient leadership.
