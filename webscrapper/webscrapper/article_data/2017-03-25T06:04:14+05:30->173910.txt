PUNE: The   ( ) will come up with 13 bus terminals for a   for Pune metro.

 With the metro underground station near the office of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the   area being cancelled, senior officials of the PMPML said the funds used for the station will be used for the terminals.
 
 “We have learned that the money used for the construction of the metro station will be diverted towards the construction of the terminals. The work on Pune metro is presently going on and there are plans to integrate all modes of transport. The buses starting from these terminals will be mainly used as feeder services for the metro,” PMPML’s joint managing director D P More told TOI.
 
 The state budget sanctioned Rs 130 crore for the Pune metro project.
 
 “The spots where these terminals will come up will be decided later. The buses from these terminals will be used to transport the passengers to the metro stations. The route has got two lines - Swargate to   and Ramwadi to Vanaz. The station which has been cancelled is located almost at the intersection of both the lines. The PMPML will plan the terminals properly,” another official at the transport body, said.
 
 A plan to change the alignment of the station was decided in a meeting of MAHA metro director board and the officials of the urban development department a fortnight ago.
 
 “The bus terminals are different from the depots. We intend to plan the depot in different areas in such a way that people can be transported to the stations easily. Also, people getting out of the trains also need options to go to many destinations. The route chart has to be chalked out carefully,” the official pointed out.
