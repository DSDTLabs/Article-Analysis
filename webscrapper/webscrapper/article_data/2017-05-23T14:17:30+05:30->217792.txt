 and Tiger Shroff’s alleged link-up raised a lot of eyebrows, especially after they released a music video of them showing some kickass moves in Befikra. Speculations were rife that they will soon be seen together in   movies as well. 

 However, trouble seems to be spewing between the two alleged lovebirds and as per reports, Disha Patani is a little miffed with Tiger because of his growing bond with his ‘Munna Michael’ co-star  .
 
 This will mark Nidhhi’s debut in Bollywood and as per close sources, the two have been getting along quite well on the sets of the movie. This growing friendship seems to have chagrined Disha and it was then that she made an abrupt visit to the sets.
 As per a close source, Disha showed up on the sets of ‘Munna Michael’ uninvited which apparently stunned everyone.
 
 Though the two haven’t come out clean about their alleged relationship but of reports are to be believed, then Tiger and Disha have been going strong since one and a half years. Wonder what the two have to say to this!
