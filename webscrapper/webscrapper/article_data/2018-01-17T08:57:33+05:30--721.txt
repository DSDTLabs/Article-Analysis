MELBOURNE:  , the six-time   champion, dismissed reports of 'player boycott', a call for increased prize-money and even 'unionism' on Tuesday, saying none of that was discussed at a player meeting in the weekend preceding the first Grand Slam of the year.

 It was reported in some sections of the media that the former world No.1 was trying to persuade fellow players to boycott next year's   event if demands for more prize-money wasn't met. At the pre-tournament   players' meeting, a mandatory event for main draw players that is also attended by ATP officials, Djokovic is believed to have asked officials to leave the room, taking over the stage.
 
 "No boycott," Djokovic said. "I saw that some of you have written a story that has been a little bit exaggerated. You've taken things out of the context. You've portrayed me as someone who is very greedy, asks for more money and wants to boycott." The 30-yearold Serb said, "We players wanted to talk about certain topics. I don't think there is anything unhealthy about that. We get together, a hundred players get together two or three times, in a whole year. This is one of the places where we get together."
