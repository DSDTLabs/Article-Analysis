 Vatsal's uncle Gulshan, who's children were also present in the same cab, lodged a complaint against the cab driver, Veyant, and alleged that Vatsal had to die because of his callous behaviour. "Vatsal, my brother's son, lost his life for Veyant's negligence. My children were also injured in the accident but are now out of danger. Veyant should be arrested at the earliest and given stringent punishment," Gulshan said. 
 
 An FIR under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt), 304A (death due to negligence) of the IPC has been registered against Veyant, who is absconding. (With inputs from Chetna Choudhry) .
