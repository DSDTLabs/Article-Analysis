 is all fun and feisty in 'Tipa', the latest song to be released from Vishal Bhardwaj’s ' '. The track, choreographed by  , has the actress dancing on an open train bogey. It was shot in  , and a rail track was specially created to shoot the number. Though the location was picturesque, it was quite remote and the team faced many challenges, including lack of mobile network and toilets. 
That’s not all. Eager to see Kangana dancing, huge crowds would gather on the location, with some crazy fans even running behind the train. In a bid to avoid being mobbed, the crew finally started shooting early in the day, much before the village would wake up. 
 The period drama, set in World War II, has Kangana play Miss Julia, an artiste who embarks on an expedition to buoy the spirit of the soldiers. 
  The actress says, “Vishal sir has a habit of reinventing his actors. Before this, no one has explored my beauty on screen. I was given a fake nose in 'Revolver Rani' and a set of fake teeth in 'Tanu Weds Manu Returns'. Throughout the look test, Vishal sir kept saying, ‘Make her look prettier than she already is’. We’ve kept the look very authentic, including the curls in my hair.” 
 About the challenges of shooting in Arunachal Pradesh, she adds, “The phone network was really bad. It got especially difficult when I had to deal with a legal issue back home in Mumbai. We’d drive 20 kilometres to receive calls. But otherwise, when I am working, I love non-network zones, especially places like Arunachal Pradesh, which are so beautiful. They bring me closer to the people I work with. Yes, we didn’t have loos, but I am a mountain woman, so I could pee behind the rocks and be cool about it. Saif (Ali Khan) and Shahid (Kapoor) were sporting, too.”
