Ahmedabad: Concerned by the sluggish pace of the vigilance inquiry into the poor quality of city roads, the petitioner on Thursday told Gujarat high court that at this rate, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) could take 158 years to complete the inquiry.

 During the hearing, petitioner Mustak Kadri’s advocate Amit Panchal highlighted that the AMC got only three samples analyzed in 45 days. 
 
 The civic body said it got samples from 13 roads, though it randomly selected 90 damaged roads for sampling, but sent only three samples for testing. There are 1,947 roads constructed over the last two years that are under vigilance scrutiny.
 
 It was submitted that if collection and analysis of three samples takes 45 days, it will take 158 years to analyze 1,947 roads and finish the vigilance inquiry. Panchal also questioned the basis for suspension of seven engineers and blacklisting of various contractors without the outcome of the inquiry. Moreover, it was also submitted that resurfacing work currently under way will hamper the inquiry.
 
 The lawyer argued so in response of AMC’s request to the HC seeking relaxation in its order to submit the vigilance inquiry report on damaged roads. AMC had ordered the inquiry on July 27, but work began only after the HC order on August 10. AMC has sought the inquiry report within a month’s time.
 
 AMC could supply just one preliminary inquiry report since then, and urged the court to allow it to file periodic reports as its inquiry progresses. The HC has slated hearing of this application for October 4. 
 
 Meanwhile, the high court ordered AMC to file a compliance report on its order by October 6.
