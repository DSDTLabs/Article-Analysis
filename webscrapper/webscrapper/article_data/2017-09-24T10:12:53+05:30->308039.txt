CHANDIGARH: Praveen   neither had a history of medical ailments nor was he suffering from heart disease, claimed family members of the 38-year-old who was killed following an alleged scuffle with an Army Colonel in a   incident, while debunking the claims made in the victim’s post-mortem report.

 The report had stated, “The cause of death is acute coronary insufficiency in a case of pre-existing coronary artery disease. There is no external injury on the body.”
 
 Colonel  , a resident of Phase VII in  , had been booked for murder in the case. His bail petition would come up for hearing on Monday .
 
 Meenakshi Yadav, sister of the victim, a resident of Sector 37, said he was healthy and about to take the family to Jalandhar but then the news of his death came.“My brother was in the field of marketing. He used to be on tour four to five times a week. He used to go for a walk daily. He had no ailment and was not taking any medicines.”
 
 Family members alleged Yadav die of suffocation. “My brother was talking over the phone and his car was parked. No accident took place as there was no scratch on the car. My brother died due to suffocation caused by Bains.”
 
 Bains had allegedly lifted up Yadav from his shirt collar during a heated argument on the road dividing sectors 34 and 44. Yadav had fallen unconscious on the spot and later declared brought dead at a hospital.
 
 She also questioned the behaviour of the accused, who was on study leave from the Army. “If my brother was at fault, he should have called the police and for him arrested or challaned.Was he teaching him discipline? Was my brother a terrorist to whom discipline had to be taught on the road?”
 
 The defence counsel has stated that a false case has been imposed upon Bains.
