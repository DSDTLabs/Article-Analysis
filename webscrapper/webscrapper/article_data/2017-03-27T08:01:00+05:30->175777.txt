 On Saturday, when the suspect called the woman again, she handed over the cellphone to her husband. "While speaking to the husband, the suspect again used profanities while threatening to kill him," the officer said, adding, "We have booked the suspect for stalking."
 
 An officer from the cybercrime cell told TOI that people, especially women, should ignore such messages received from any unknown number. The officer suggested that they immediately contact the police and lodge a complaint.
