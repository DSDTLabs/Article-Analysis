AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( ),   (AUDA) and   in   in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging encroachment on a public plot allotted to the school for playground.

 Local residents have moved the HC and complained that the civic body allotted a public plot to the school at a token rate of Rs 1.5 lakh to use it as school’s playground. But the school authority has converted it into its parking plot and constructed a wall restraining people living in the neighbourhood from using it during non-school hours, the residents alleged. The petitioners have sought HC intervention so that the plot could be made free for public use after school hours.
 
 The PIL was filed after residents in the same area raised objection against Nirma Foundation’s use of such plot and its denial to residents from using the same. A PIL was also filed in this case.
