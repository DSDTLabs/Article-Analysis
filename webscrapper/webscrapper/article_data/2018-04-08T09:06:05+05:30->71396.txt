AHMEDABAD: Union leaders and family members of Bharat Purabiya, a worker of Lambha ward, South Zone, who had died on duty, refused to cremate the body unless a family member of the deceased was given a job.

 Till late in the night, the body of Purabiya who died of heart attack while on duty, remained in the   campus at Danapith. After the heart attack, Purabiya was moved to the corporation hospital where he was declared dead. The body of Purabiya was taken to the main office of AMC where hundreds of workers gathered and chanted Ramdhun.
 
 Various unions of the sanitation workers gathered and demanded job and compensation for the family of Bharat. “We will not cremate the body or move away from the corporation until we get written assurance from the municipal commissioner promising a job to family members of deceased,” said a union member.
 
 The union leaders also met municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar. However, AMC officials said that Purabiya was neither a daily wager nor a regular employee. “If some permanent employee dies, we have a policy to accommodate his family member in the corporation.The corporation has assured the union leaders that they will work out some solution,” said an AMC official.
