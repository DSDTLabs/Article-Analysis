PERTH:   went down to   0-1 in a closely fought encounter at the 2017 men's   here.

 India A, who had got off to a rollicking start with a 4-1 win over   in their opening match, gave their best as well before going down by a solitary goal.
 
 With the likes of Tom Craig, Blake Govers, Kieran Govers, Matthew Dawson and Ben Craig in the NSW squad - all of whom have played for the Australian national team - the Indians had to come with their best game plan.
 
 Indians put up a strong defence to keep NSW forwards from making successful forays into their circle.
 
 With goalless first and second quarter, the final 30 minutes of the match promised to be a tense battle.
 
 NSW managed to net the ball in the 37th minute when Blake Govers beat the Indian goalkeeper  , who was brought into the match in the second quarter, to score a field goal.
 
 The final 15 minutes saw Indian forwards make desperate attempts to equalise but they failed to succeed. There was nerve-biting action with NSW keeping up the pressure and eventually walking home with the winners' points.
 
 On Monday, India A will clash with Northern Territory in their next Pool B encounter.
