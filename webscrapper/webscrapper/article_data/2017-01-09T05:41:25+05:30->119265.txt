NEW DELHI: The Centre has accorded ‘Z’ category security cover to Samajwadi Party’s   MP  , a close aide of  , who is locked in a leadership battle with his son and Uttar Pradesh CM Akhiklesh Yadav.

 The home ministry, while asking   to provide security to Amar Singh with immediate effect, cited threat perception following “recent activities” as the reason for extending the cover. Amar Singh has also been at the heart of the strife within the party with the Akhilesh camp seeking his ouster.
 
 Officials said the home ministry order came on Saturday night, asking the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to take up the task with immediate effect. “In view of recent activities, there is perceptible threat (to Singh),” an official said citing inputs provided by security agencies which feel Singh should be brought under VIP security cover.
 
 Singh had claimed in October last year that he fears party general secretary   while asking for additional security from the Centre.
 
 “When there was a danger to Charan Singh, Ram Gopal Yadav used to carry a carbine to protect him. He is a person who has used the carbine as well as the pen,” he had said.
