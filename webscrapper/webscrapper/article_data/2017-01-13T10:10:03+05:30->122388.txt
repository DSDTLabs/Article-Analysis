HYDERABD: Incidents of   in Hyderabad remained in double digits for long until 2014, when they increased seven fold-from 52 the previous year to 367. The rise is attributed to   and kidnapping. Experts analysing crime patterns are yet to reach a conclusion on what led to the spurt, though the police have some theories.

 The   (NCRB) recently released data on crime against children in Hyderabad for 2011-15. In all, 1,031 cases were registered during the period, 42% of which occurred in 2015 alone. The share of 2014, the year of the sudden rise, is 35%.
 
 Cases of sex crimes against children numbered 10 in 2010, increasing to 32 in 2011, decreasing to 21 the year after, and then increasing 362% to 97 in 2014, slightly decreasing to 85 in 2015. As for kidnapping, cases increased from 13 in 2010 to 25 in 2011 to 16 the year after, and then rising 16 times to 259 in 2014, reaching 293 in 2015.As for murder, just one case was registered in 2011, then five, going down to two, but increasing to nine and then eleven. The figures are so low that it would be erroneous to infer trends from the data.
 
 Cops attribute the spurt in cases of crime against children to proactive policing, resulting in more victims coming forward to register cases. They also say that because of increased awareness in society about sex crimes, more parents have started coming forward with complaints of sexual harassment and rape.
 
  
  
 
 As far as the spurt in kidnapping is concerned, the police say most of the cases are of elopement. They say that usually in such cases, underage girls run away with young adult males, and their parents lodge complaints of kidnapping against the men.
 
 Of the sex crime cases, 2530% pertain to penetrative sexual assault [this is section 4 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012; can be interpreted as rape], says additional commissioner of police (crime) Swati Lakra.“The rest of the cases fall under different sections of POCSO.“
 
 She says the police awareness campaign has borne fruit. “Several campaigns have been org anized in schools and colleges. With the help of NGOs, the police have been able to reach the interiors of the city to speak to parents and to children, especially about 'good touch' and 'bad touch'." 
 
  (CWC) member Achutha Rao says the government generally sees crime against children as isolated incidents but a stage has been reached when a large section of children have become victims of crime. “There is a need to increase accountability of stakeholders like the police, the women and child welfare department, teachers and parents to protect children from getting victimised. The police should be proactive in cracking down on culprits.“
 
 Anuradha, president of the child rights NGO Balala Hakkula Sangam, says sex crime can be controlled only if the police take stringent action against criminals and send a strong signal as a deterrent. “Crime against children can also come down if parents remain alert in monitoring their wards.“
