 The initiative will begin with a workshop in Thiruvananthapuram to gather feedback and proposals for making destinations friendlier for the disabled. An audit of select tourism spots will be done in the first week of May.
 
 “With the help of expert agencies, an audit of major tourism destinations Thekkady, Kumarakom will be held. The audit will focus on how accessible these destinations are currently. They will also look at the feasibility of modifying the locations so that they are friendlier for the disabled. A study of the accessibility of the public transportation in the locality and the public toilets will also be held,” said RTM, state coordinator, Roopesh Kumar.
 
 RTM has also plans to make 1,000 accommodation units across the state accessible for the disabled by roping in homestays and resorts who would be asked to improve their infrastructure.
 
 Attention will be paid to ensuring enough facilities for people who are blind/deaf/mute. “The propositions drawn from the workshop will be used as guidelines for producing a report after the audit, which will include the present status of the destinations. The report will then be submitted to the government for further action and fund allocation,” Kumar said. DTPCs in each district will also be involved with the projects guided by RTM. Presently, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram DTPCS are working alongside RTM in the accessible tourism project.
 
 The mission has also plans to promote tourism related startups which are founded by disabled entrepreneurs.
 
 “Tour packages for and by the disabled will be promoted as part of developing the state into a 100% accessible destination,” Kumar added.
