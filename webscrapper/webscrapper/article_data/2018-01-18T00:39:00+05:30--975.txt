Trichy: Bullock cart owners from Musiri area have demanded relaxation of the blanket ban on sand mining to save their livelihood and that they be allowed to quarry across Cauvery in the area. Ever since the ban was imposed on sand mining in Cauvery and Kollidam, truck and bullock cart owners have been raking up the issue of their livelihood being hit and demanding reopening of the quarries. Around 100 men from villages around Musiri situated along the Cauvery river petitioned the district collector in this regard on Wednesday. They said that they had lost their only source of income — which was quarrying sand from Cauvery with permission and selling them for construction work in the Musiri area. “Our business depended on the construction work going on in areas around Musiri. We took sand with proper permission and paid prescribed fee to the PWD. The abrupt ban on sand mining has put our livelihood at stake. So, we request the district collector to permit us to take sand from Cauvery to save us,” said a bullock cart owner, C Murugan. In fact, the bullock cart owners also claimed that they were incapable of properly feeding the bulls because of their financial troubles.  Since district collector K Rajamani was unavailable, they submitted the petition to the officials concerned. Official sources said that they could forward their demand to the government. It may be recalled that bull owners from Srirangam area had also demanded permission to take sand from Cauvery.
