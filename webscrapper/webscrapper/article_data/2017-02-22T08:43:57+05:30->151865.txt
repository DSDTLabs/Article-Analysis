KOTTAYAM: Efforts are on to present the   in the upcoming budget session itself, said health minister  . Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, the minister said that the bill aimed at regulating the rates at   through law had been prepared by the health department.

 The government was aware that the exorbitant rates in private hospitals were unaffordable to common man, she said. “At present there are several limitations for the government to control private hospitals. Though a chain of government hospitals is functioning across the state only 34% of the patients are going there,“ she said adding that the government was trying to change to this trend.
 
 The minister also said that Cath Labs had been allotted for eight district hospitals and dialysis units for 44 taluk hospitals. “Before the tenure of the current government ends all Taluk hospitals will have dialysis units,“ the minister said.
 
 She also made clear that the LDF Government had no plan to begin all the medical colleges announced by the previous UDF government. Priority would be given to the Medical College in Idukki. The medical colleges in Wayanad and Kasaragod were also given top priority. Haripad Medical College was not even under the consideration of the government, she said.
 
 “The concept of family doctor will be introduced in all primary health centres. For this the service of two doctors will be made available in all PHCs,“ she said.
