BENGALURU: For once, politicians were not as wary about their opponents as they were about rain disrupting the show. In fact, some   aspirants even took to social media, urging voters to come out before the skies open up.

 
 From Congress’ Byatarayanapura MLA candidate Krishna Byre   to BJP’s CT Ravi, a host of them took to Twitter to urge voters to vote early. But there were no signs of rain through the day. “Don’t forget to do your bit! It’s really simple and go before the rains hit us again this afternoon (sic),” Gowda tweeted.
 
 Congress’ social media incharge Srivatsa too warned people about possible rain.
 
 BJP   general secretary and   CT Ravi tweeted: “Afternoon rains will result in flooding of IT city and you might be stranded at home due to non-availability of boats.”
