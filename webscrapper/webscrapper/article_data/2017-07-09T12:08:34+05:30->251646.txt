LUCKNOW: A book on a two-day training   for   before the first session of the new UP Assembly will be a guide for future political leaders as well as analysts, said Governor   at Raj Bhawan on Saturday. He was gifted the book by the Vidhan Sabha Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit who went to Raj Bhawan along with MLA Kuldip Singh Sengar.

 Naik said he was impressed with Dixit getting the book published in such a short time. He said speeches and issues raised are usually heard and forgotten but recording them in the form of a book would guide generations of public representatives. Dixit had organised a two-day training camp for MLAs of the new assembly on May 3 and 4 and it was inaugurated by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, while Naik was chief guest. Speeches of Naik, Mahajan and other MLAs are printed in the book. Naik said a function will be held soon for the formal launch of the book.
