NEW DELHI:   weighing around 2kg was discovered by a   crew member at IGI   on Wednesday. The narcotics were discovered in two packets fastened by a black tape and hidden beneath a catering trolley during shifting of the trolleys from Air India flight-440. The flight from Chennai had landed in Delhi at 9am.

 Sources said the packets were discovered around noon when the trolleys were being moved by a ground   member. 
 
 The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) was informed and after checking and weighing the packets, NCB officials said that they contained a mixture of morphine weighing approximately 1,895 grams. 
 
 “Samples of the contraband were taken for lab testing and the remaining material deposited in the customs warehouse at arrival level,” said an official.
 
  “Customs officers are investigating the issue. The accused could not be identified during the initial probe,” said Dhananjay Kumar, Air India spokesperson. The packets were found in the food trolley which was uplifted in Chennai, he added. 
 
 Sources said that the contraband may have been sent to Delhi to be smuggled into the city. 
 
 The airline crew is also being investigated, along with the ground-handling staff. In the past, there have been instances where customs discovered gold — in the toilets of flights — to be smuggled to other cities.
