VADODARA:   has decided to approach  , which is currently in news for  , in connection to a probe related to plagiarism. 

 It was in March this year that a city-based advocate had alleged that professor  , the former dean of MSU’s Faculty of Arts as head of Department of Sociology had cleared a PhD thesis which was plagiarised. Advocate Shailesh Amin had submitted evidence suggesting that Choondawat as guide had cleared a PhD thesis of a professor Chandramani More from K M Shah Dental College and Hospital of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth who had plagiarised entire thesis of his student Dr Krushna Thakkar.
 
 In December 2009 Thakkar, who was then a student of master of dental surgery in oral medicine and radiology, had submitted her dissertation titled ‘An epidemiological study of tobacco and arecanut use, its effect on oral health and determining specific age and gender in rural area of Waghodia taluka, Vadodara district’. Professor More, head of the department, was her guide. 
 
 Later, More himself submitted his PhD on the same subject titled ‘Social and cultural aspect of tobacco and arecanut use in Gujarat: a sociological study’ under Choondawat’s guidance in October 2011.
 
 Based on Amin’s representation, MSU had constituted a probe committee under convenorship of professor R C Patel. The committee which has so far conducted one meeting is finding it difficult to move ahead with the probe for lack of documents. 
 
 “Next week we will be writing an official letter to Sumandeep Vidyapeeth seeking the dissertation that the student had submitted,” said assistant registrar Mayank Vyas, who is member secretary of the probe committee.
