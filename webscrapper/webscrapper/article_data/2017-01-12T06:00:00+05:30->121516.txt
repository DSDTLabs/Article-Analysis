KOLKATA: A doctor employed with a   for the past two years, who was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly duping aspiring students with promises of  , has nine cases pending against him. Accused Dr   was arrested for the first time two years ago, but the administration had no clue about it. Interrogation revealed that he had produced fake papers to get his job. 

 According to Bidhannagar North police sources, Pal was arrested in Tripura for the first time two years ago on charges of cheating two Tripura residents by promising their sons admission in Bengaluru medical colleges in lieu of money. The radiologist and another doctor Baichitra Sarkar, a physiotherapist working in a private hospital in Kolkata, had charged Rs 40 lakh from Dilip Bhaumik, a gynaecologist and proprietor of a nursing home in Agartala, and Rs 30 lakh from businessman Sadhan Chandra Dhar for getting their sons admitted to Bengaluru-based medical colleges in 2013.
 
 When Bahumik and Dhar went to Bengaluru, the college authorities refused to admit their kids. When they returned to Kolkata and took up the matter with Pal and Sarkar, they didn’t get their money back. 
 
 Cops are mulling questioning owners of a few private medical colleges in Bengaluru. The same set of colleges were named as ‘targets’ when another gang was busted in Salt Lake in 2014. The modus operandi became finer with each passing year, say police. “On each occasion, they managed to get bail within two months. Now we are trying to slap stringent sections to keep him in jail,” said a Bidhannagar officer.
 
 Both Kolkata Police and CID may now lodge separate FIRs since more victims have approached them after learning about the arrest.
