HYDERABAD: Following after Sanskrit lecturers, Hindi teachers have also boycotted intermediate paper evaluation duties, and are demanding that the state revert its decision to make Telugu a compulsory subject.

 
 Pointing out that scores of Hindi teachers will lose their jobs if the state makes   up to class 12, they opined that the state should instead encourage all languages.
  
  
 
 “In order to promote Telugu language, the state is neglecting other languages. Authorities should retract their decision, and promise that Hindi language will also be protected, and that we are not going to lose our jobs. Till then, we are not going to cooperate and take part in evaluating answer sheets of students,” said S Zabee, a Hindi lecturer.
 
 
 “Unless the state immediately solves the issue, the announcement of   results is likely to get delayed this year. It’s not just us, even the Sanskrit lecturers are on strike and we don’t see this strike ending anytime soon,” said Shailaja K, another Hindi lecturer.
 
 
 They said that in other states, the regional language is made compulsory only till class 10 and said that the same should be followed in Telangana too.
 
 
 “Sanskrit lecturers will be the most affected ones followed by Hindi, Arabic, and French lecturers. The government should immediately clear the stand and make sure that the 500 Hindi lecturers and thousands of other language teachers don’t lose their jobs,” said K Suresh of the Telangana Government Colleges' Contract  
 
 
 In the state, about one lakh students gave their Hindi exam. Most students take Sanskrit as their second language over others, as it is a scoring subject. Correction of the answer sheets should have begun by March 7, but to date, evaluation of   are yet to begin.
