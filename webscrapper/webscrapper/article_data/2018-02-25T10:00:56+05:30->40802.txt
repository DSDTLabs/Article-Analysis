The   state unit has debunked the tactical approach mooted by the party general secretary   and reiterated its vehement opposition to any electoral truck with the Congress.

 According to CPM leaders from Kerala, the Congress was pursuing neo-liberal agenda and any understanding would affect the political credibility of the party.
 
 “We are ready for joint struggles with the Congress within the parliament and outside, against the neo-liberal policies. But the Congress is not interested in fights against the antipeople policies of the   government like demonetization,’’ said  , central committee member of the CPM, while briefing the media on the discussions at the ongoing state conference.
 
 A Vijayaraghavan, another central committee member, said the Congress was the advocate of neo-liberal economic policies and its credibility as an ally in the fight against the BJP was doubtful. Both the leaders were at pains to explain that Yechury had not advocated electoral understanding with the Congress at the inaugural session of the CPM state conference. The general secretary only spoke about adoption of ‘appropriate tactics’ at the time of elections, and this did not mean a tie-up with the Congress, they argued.
 
 CPM has directed its cadres not to initiate any kind of political violence, he said. “We have also told cadres not to attack houses. But, attacks against us are continuing in different parts of the state. In the last two weeks alone, several local leaders were injured in the attacks. As media downplays them, people don’t know about it,” said Vijayaraghavan.
 
 He said a sentiment shared by delegates during the discussion was that the party should not give weapons to its enemies. “Such isolated i issues are used by party’s enemies and media to attack us. It even helps the   which is disintegrating, politically”, he said. When asked whether criticism was against Kannur unit, he said that was against a trend which needed to be arrested.
