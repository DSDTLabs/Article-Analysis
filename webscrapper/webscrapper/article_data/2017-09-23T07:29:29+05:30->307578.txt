KOLKATA:   services were disrupted for over an hour on Friday morning after a technical glitch at a Y-crossing beyond   station, which is used to reverse Down trains to the Up line for fresh runs towards Dum Dum. Although officials took immediate remedial measures and started Up trains from the Down platform without reversing them, there were delays and hundreds of commuters were stuck at various stations as trains that arrived were too crowded. 

 Down trains that terminate their journey at Kavi Subhash are driven further south to the Y-crossing after passengers get off. The 'points' are then reversed and trains are driven back to the Up track and the platform. Around 11.10 am on Friday, the 'points' failed and trains could no longer be moved to the Up track.
 
 "Even as technical staff attended to the problem, we made announcements urging passengers waiting for Up trains to move to the Down platform. After Down trains arrived at the platform and passengers got off, those waiting for Up trains got in. The trains were then driven in the reverse direction till a crossover to the north of the station. At this crossover, the trains would be moved to the Up track. However, while these crossovers took place, some trains had to be stopped at the home signal resulting in delay. Services became normal around 12.15 pm after the 'points' was repaired," said Indrani  , CPRO, Metro Railway. 
 
 Till normalcy was restored, trains had to be controlled at various stations. According to Banerjee, 10 trains started from Kavi Subhash by using the crossover between 11.10 am and 12.15 pm. Had the situation been normal, 13 trains could have been run during this period.
