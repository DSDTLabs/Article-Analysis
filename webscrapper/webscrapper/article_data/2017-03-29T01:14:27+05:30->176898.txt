NEW DELHI: The Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) has found that most vehicle manufacturers didn’t prepare for the April 1 deadline for a nationwide rollout of BS-IV norm by scaling down their production of BS-III vehicles.

 An analysis by EPCA of BS-III vehicle inventories, which   (SIAM) had submitted to the SC recently, reveals that many companies continued production of BS-III vehicles in large numbers between January and March 2017. 
 
 “All vehicle manufacturers have continued and even increased production of BS III vehicles in the last quarter. SIAM has explained this by saying that sales are always high from February to March. However, this only confirms that there was no shift to BS IV.  , for example, produced 10,935 vehicles in January 2016 whereas it was 11,563 vehicles in January 2017,” the analysis said. The inventory for heavy commercial vehicles as on March 20, 2017 is 96,724. This is far higher than SIAM’s earlier submission to EPCA wherein it had claimed that 75,000 vehicles would remain to be sold on April 1, 2017. 
 
 Experts said the concern is more with heavy diesel vehicles because of their heavy pollution potential. According to EPCA, there can be up to 80% reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions from trucks if they move to BS-IV stage. “The commercial vehicle manufacturers will have 13.82% of the annual production in stock as of March 20, 2017. Almost 15% of their annual sales will be in stock as of March 20, 2017. Ashok Leyland, Mahindra, Tata and Eicher-Volvo will have 95% of the BS-III inventory,” the analysis revealed.
 
 Production of BS-III cars had more of less tapered off in the last quarter. The BS-III inventory as on March 20, 2017 is about 16,198. 
 
 The three-wheeler sector, however, is far from meeting the deadline. “This sector shows a complete disregard for the shift to BS-IV stage. SIAM had submitted to EPCA that 45,000 vehicles would remain as of March 31, 2017. This included figures for Bajaj, which has the largest market share in the segment. Now, the estimates are that 40,048 three-wheelers would remain in stock, which is 13% of the annual production,” the analysis said. 
 
 The total stock of two-wheelers by March 20, 2017 is 6,71,305, which is roughly 4% of total production from January 2016 to March 20, 2017. 
 
 The stand-off on the rollout of BS IV norms started in October 2016 when EPCA had directed that vehicle manufacturers exhaust their stock of non-BS-IV vehicles before April 1, 2017. But when the SC-mandated authority called another meeting in early February 2017, SIAM said manufacturers were not ready to meet the EPCA deadline.
 
 The ministry of road transport and highways in its 2015 notification talks about manufacturing only BS-IV compliant vehicles from April 1, 2017. It doesn’t mention when registration of BS III vehicles is to be stopped.
