An amalgamation of  's two stories was staged at the Tribal Museum by Tikamgarh's artistes. The director of the play Sandeep Shrivastav used Premchand's Kafan and Poos Ki Raat in the modern context.
  
  In one part the story shows the deplorable state of a Halku farmer and his family. Even though his family was neck deep in poverty yet, he was a man of virtues. His daughter wanted to study hard and put an end to all these situations. Halku had a dog who accompanied him everywhere. But one day he lost his life while fighting against stray animals which hurt his master. Another part of the story portrayed the story of a father and son who were collectors and spent the whole day lazing around here and there. The daughter in law of the family dies due to labour pain, but they ignore her and eat boiled potatoes. Then after some time, they go in the village seeking money for the cremation ceremony. Amidst this, they spot a wine shop and spend all the money on drinking and leave the body as it is. To engage the audience, more live music was played, and Bundeli dialogues were used to make it more interesting. Both the stories portray the on-going situations in the country.
