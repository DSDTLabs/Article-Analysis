Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) has collected penalty amounting to Rs127.44 crore over the past six years, said joint commissioner Dilip Gawde. More than a fourth of the total amount, about Rs46.01 crore, was collected between 2017-18.

 According to Gawde, 12,260 residential property owners have paid up a penalty worth Rs31.75 crore between 2017-18 while another 1,823 owners of non-residential, mixed, and industrial properties have paid Rs14.26 crore as yet. As a result, the total penalty collected amounts to Rs46.01 crore in 2017-18.
 
 The state, through a government resolution (GR) in 2008, allowed civic bodies to collect penalty amounting to twice the property tax for unauthorized construction. However, the civic body only began collecting the amount from 2012-13. From then until 2016-17, the civic body collected a total of Rs81.43 crore as penalty charges.
 
 In January 2017, the state issued a GR detailing that unauthorized constructions up to 600 sq ft would not have to pay the penalty charges henceforth. Owners of constructions with area between 601 to 1,000 sq ft will have to pay half the penalty charges. Those owning an area above 1,001 sq ft would have to continue to pay penalty charges equivalent to twice the property tax.
 
 Gawde said that the property owners must take benefit of the GR and start paying the penalty charges.
