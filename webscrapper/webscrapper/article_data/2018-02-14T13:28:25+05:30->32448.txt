TRICHY: Alleging that police personnel attached to the Cantonment police station falsely picked up two transgenders and charged them with the offence of causing public nuisance by pestering commuters to give money, members of the transgender community resorted to a   outside the station on Tuesday.

 Police sources said they have been receiving frequent complaints from the public accusing the transgenders of intercepting pedestrians and commuters and extorting money. It is alleged that the transgenders in a couple of incidents forced a few men to part with their money by hurling a volley of abuses near the Central bus stand as well as the   railway station.
 
 Following the complaints, Cantonment police on Tuesday during inspection picked up two transgenders aged 28 and 30 years who were accused of extorting money and causing public nuisance near the central bus stand complex.
 
 Meanwhile, on hearing about the two transgenders being picked up by the police for inquiry, around 50 members of the transgender community laid siege to the Cantonment police station on Tuesday afternoon, seeking their release.
 
 “We are forced to seek alms as our families have abandoned us. Due to lack of employment opportunities we seek money from public but we never have harassed or assaulted any commuter,” said a 35-year-old transgender from   bypass road.
 
 As the transgender community across the city assembled in front of the Cantonment police station near  , police personnel held peace talks with them and dispersed the protesters. Cantonment police said that a case was not registered against the two transgenders till Tuesday evening. “The two were taken to the MGMGH for medical examination to ascertain whether they are transgenders. A case could be registered only after the medical examination,” a police source said.
