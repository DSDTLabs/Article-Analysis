 "Girish and I had gone to meet Sanju in Agra where he is filming 'Bhoomi'. He hummed a few songs he'd penned when in prison. He has a scratch version recorded and was touched by one particular song 'O meri aangan ki chidiya hai tu' is about a father-daughter relationship. It's beautifully written and relevant to our film as Sanju's character loses his child. I got very emotional when I heard it and told him we would like to use it in 'Torbaaz'. He readily agreed," informs producer, Rahul Mittra.
 
  When behind the bars, Sanjay has written many songs in different genre,, including qawwalis and romantic ditties.
 
 "He should actually come up with his own music album," says the awed filmmaker. Sanjay has previously lent his voice to songs like Khubsoorat's 'Aye Shivani', the title track of David Dhawan's 'Chal Mere Bhai' and 'Samjho Ho Hi Gaya' in 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai', among others. Will he be singing this one too? "We are yet to decide on that," Rahul keeps it short. Shooting starts by the middle of the year in the Middle-East.
