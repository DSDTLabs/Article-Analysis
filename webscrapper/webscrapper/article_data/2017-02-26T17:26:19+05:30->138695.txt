 Now, Malayalis can again see him on screen with 'the complete actor' in ad film maker  's movie.It seems the film has been titled   and it will have   playing Mohanlal's dad. It is touted that   and   will also be playing pivotal roles in it. The myth has it that Odiyan, the man who is mastered in 'odividya', a black magic trick to tackle the enemies. The film is written by Harikrishnan. 
 
 It has been reported that Odiyan will be a 3D Malayalam movie. Though the news is abuzz, the director is not so keen in revealing much about it. When contacted, Sreekumar, who was miffed about rumours told us, "The film is in a very premature stage. It is just a thought I had and I have no clue who is spreading all these. If anything progresses, I would definitely tell you."
