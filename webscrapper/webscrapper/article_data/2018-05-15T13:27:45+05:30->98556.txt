VADODARA: An auto-rickshaw driver was booked for setting a widow’s house on fire in   on Sunday evening after she refused to talk to him.

 Complainant Gauri Solanki told police that her husband died around six years back. A year after his death, the   Santosh   made several attempts to talk to Solanki. She did not respond to Vasava’s attempts and despite asking him not to contact her, he continued harassing her, she told the police.
 
 On Sunday evening, when Solanki was away, Vasava barged into her house and tried to set the furniture on fire. Police said that several mattresses and pillows in Solanki’s house were gutted. When the widow returned home, she saw that her neighbours were trying to douse the fire by splashing buckets of water.
 
 Later, Solanki’s son told her he saw Vasava fleeing from the window of their house. Police said that Vasava was externed by police from the city but he returned in March this year.
