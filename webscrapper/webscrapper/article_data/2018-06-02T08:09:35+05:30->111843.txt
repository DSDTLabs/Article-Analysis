AHMEDABAD:   high court on Friday stayed the   ( ) from declaring a loan account of an employee as NPA. The woman had taken a home loan to reconstruct a house destroyed during the 2001 killer quake.

 Justice Biren Vaishnav issued notice to SBI and posted further hearing in this matter on June 19.
 
 According to case details, an SBI employee, Kalpana Shah, lost her house in an apartment in   in the earthquake. Fifteen persons had died in the building collapse. She wanted to reconstruct the house. Her husband, advocate   had filed a PIL in the high court, before which the banking authorities and the government assured that for reconstruction of houses lost during the quake, the housing loan would be made available at fixed interest rate between 6.5% and 8%.
 
 Shah obtained the loan, but SBI calculated floating interest rates. She continued to pay instalments regularly for 17 long years. At the fag end of loan repayment, she requested the bank to charge fixed interest rate according to the assurance given before the high court. But she did not receive any response from the bank.
 
 On the other hand, she received bank’s communication that she had dues of over Rs 35,000 and if not paid within a day, her loan account will be declared as NPA. She has moved the   against the bank’s decision stating that she never defaulted on payment and the bank should have abided by its promise of charging fixed interest rate instead of floating interest rate.
