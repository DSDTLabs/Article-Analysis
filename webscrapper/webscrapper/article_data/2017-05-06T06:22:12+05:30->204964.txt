BHOPAL:   on Friday dismissed the petition filed for requesting the court to instruct government to frame regulations for regulating the fee of private schools. 

 A division bench of high court comprising Chief Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice S Abhyankar dismissed the petition saying that the powers to frame rules are with the state government, high court cannot issue any guidelines in this regards. 
 
 The petition was filed by PG Najpandey of volunteer organisation Nagrik Upbhokta Margdarshak Manch in 2014, wherein Pandey challenged the annual fee hike by the private schools of the state. The petitioner had informed in the petition that in April 2014, Jabalpur district collector had ordered the private schools that school fee should not hiked, but soon the top officials of the school education department issued orders restricting the district collector to issue any orders in relation to the schools. 
 
 Later, the Jabalpur district collector cancelled his own orders, the petitioner said. How can an official give an order to cancel any order that was given by the collector as judicial magistrate, the petitioner alleged. Such orders can only be given by the court, the petitioner claimed. 
 
 But when the court had asked the petitioner that under what rules court can issue orders to the state government for framing laws and rules, the petitioner failed to reply, said sources. Subsequently the court dismissed the petition.
 
 During the hearing of this petition in court, the state government had however informed the court that the process for framing rules for regulating the school fee of private schools is already underway, though nothing concrete has come up so far, said sources.
