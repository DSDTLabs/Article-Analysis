BENGALURU: Stunned by the diary revelations, efforts at damage control have begun with   general secretary Karnataka in-charge   arriving in Bengaluru on Sunday for the state   coordination committee meeting. The agenda is reportedly a revamp of the cabinet and   office-bearers.

 A party source told TOI that a re look into the Congress functioning at the government and party levels was on the cards, and the diary only hastened the process. â€œThe Congress high command kept putting off an overhaul of the party in Karnataka, now it cannot afford to delay things, with elections 15 months away,'' they added.
 
 It is learnt that some major proposals will be placed before the 28-member coordination panel comprising chief minister Siddaramaiah, KPCC president G Parameshwara and senior ministers.One looks into the possibility of drafting ministers who have completed four years in the cabinet for party work.
 
 An internal report suggested that four teams should be constituted to identify winnable candidates in the 102 constituencies which the Congress lost in 2013. Regarding MLAs, replacements should be found for those who have not been active in their constituencies, it said.
 
 Ministers who will exit the cabinet will each be given 15 constituencies to take care of, and ensure the victory of candidates. A panel under the leadership of legislative council former chairpersons B L Shankar and V R Sudarshan will look into disseminating programmes and policies of the government. A proposal to reconstitute presidents of 20 district units and replace heads in 225 of 454 block committees is planned.
