PANAJI: Following a notification from the Centre to waive registration   of vendors selling plastic bags above 50 microns, the Corporation of the City of   ( ) on Tuesday stopped accepting registration fees at Rs 4,000 per month from traders.

 CCP commissioner Ajit Roy said the fees paid by vendors in the capital city will be refunded. This month, the corporation has collected fees to the tune of Rs 3.6 lakh from 12 vendors of large supermarkets, bakeries, dry fruits, wine stores and restaurants. 
 
 “I have already instructed the accounts taxation officer to ensure that registration fees are not collected from those who come for renewal of licence. We will refund those who have already paid,” Roy said during a meeting on Tuesday. 
 
 The corporation had made registration compulsory at the time of renewal of trade and occupational licences for traders who wanted to disburse plastic bags above 50 microns. Those who didn’t register and pay the fee were asked to give a declaration stating that they would not hand out plastic bags.
 
 Traders found giving customers plastic bags below 50 microns will be fined between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, Roy said.
