Hyderabad: With the strike by transporters entering the third day on Saturday and bringing 90-95% lorries to a standstill, the government called for a meeting to discuss ways to ensure supply of essential commodities to people. The lorry owners’ associations leading the stir have reiterated that they will not call off their agitation till their demand of curbing ‘extra toll tax’ is met.

 So far, transportation of essential commodities has not been hit. “They are exempted. We will take a call in a day or two on whether to stop the movement of essential commodities. We have learnt that arrangements are being made to transport goods in buses,” said Durga Prasad, secretary of TS Lorry Owners’ Association and leader of South India Motor Transport Association.
 
 Chairing a meeting of senior officials at the Secretariat, chief secretary SP Singh said RTC buses must be allowed to transport essential commodities and all district collectors should send daily reports to the control room set up at the transport department. Officials told him that they have written to the Union transport ministry on the transporters’ demands that can only be addressed by the central government.
