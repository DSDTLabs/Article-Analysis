NOIDA: The glaring loopholes in the voters’ list has prompted a citizens’ group,  , to write to chief election commissioner seeking an inquiry into the issue as well as measures to correct the list.

 “RWAs, residents group as well as members of Indian Citizen Council have received numerous complaints from sectors such as 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 31, 37, 49, 36, 30, 41, 39, 52, 62, among others including Greater   and Ghaziabad that their names were missing from the voters list in the recently concluded assembly elections held on February 11. We also visited more than 10 sectors and found that the problem was profound across the city. This is why we have written to chief election commissioner demanding an inquiry into the matter and ensure corrective measures to reinstate the names of those missing in the voters list,” said P S Jain, president, ICC.
 
 According to Jain, ICC along with RWAs “received complaints from those who have voted in earlier elections, with valid voter cards and have been living in their own homes for decades found their names missing or cut off from the voters list,” said Jain. 
 
 Demanding a thorough inquiry, ICC secretary Prashant Tyagi maintained that many voters whose names were found missing from the voters list had not requested their names to be cut off from the list as per requirement via Form 7 of the rules laid by EC. “Yet, their names were found missing from the sector/booth voters list,” said Tyagi.
