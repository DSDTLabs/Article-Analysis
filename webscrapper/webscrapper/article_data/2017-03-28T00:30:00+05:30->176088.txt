 Bengaluru: The unseemly sight of seized vehicles piled up in front of police stations may soon be a thing of past. Police are disposing of these rickety vehicles on a war-footing. About 2,536 vehicles, most of them two-wheelers, have been auctioned in the past 50 days.
 
 Confiscated vehicles parked in and around police stations are more than an eyesore. They have turned into a haven for miscreants to indulge in illegal activities. In January 2017, the city police stations were in possession of 5,667 seized vehicles: 4,956 two-wheelers, 439 cars and 272 autorickshaws.
 
 Police commissioner Praveen Sood said the plan is to dispose of all seized vehicles other than those involving pending court cases. “These vehicles eat into lots of space and there’s no use keeping them outside stations ,” he said.
 
 Vehicles confiscated by police fall under under two categories. The first category includes vehicles seized from accused involved in cases, including robbery, dacoity, mugging and murder among other things. The second one comprises abandoned and stolen vehicles and those seized for having no proper documents.
 
 High demand for Bullets, Yezdis 
 
 The auction of vehicles by police is always on the radar of people looking for vintage vehicles. Royal Enfield Bullets, particularly pre-2000 models, and Yezdi bikes sell like hotcakes, said an inspector. “No matter how bad the condition of these vehicles may be, they will draw enthusiastic bidders,” he said.
