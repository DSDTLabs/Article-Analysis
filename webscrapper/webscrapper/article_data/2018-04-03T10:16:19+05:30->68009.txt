NEW DELHI: Former India weightlifter Karnam Malleswari has shown full confidence in India's 225-member contingent and has backed it to return home with its best showing ever at the  . In the last three editions, the Indian contingent has amassed a total of 215 medals - 50 in 2006, 101 in 2010 and 64 in 2014 – and Malleswari believes that this edition can bring India its best medal tally at the Quadrennial Games.

 
 
 
 
 
 “Personally I feel in the 2018 Commonwealth Games India will win plenty of medals. The women’s hockey team, wrestlers, weightlifters, shooters and the badminton players are India’s best bet. I recently met Rani Rampal, India’s women hockey team captain, at an awards function and she exuded great confidence in her team. Women wrestler Pooja Dhanda is the other athlete who impressed me most with her recent performances at the Wrestling League. She beat World and Olympic Champion Helen Maroulis,” Malleswari, who won a bronze medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, wrote in her column for TOI.
 
 
 
 
 
 “Among the weightlifters I expect gold from World Champion Mirabai Channu, Sanjita Chanu and Pradip Singh in the men’s 105 kg category. At the Commonwealth Championships Pradeep beat an 18 years old record set by Daljit Singh.”
 
 The coming of age of Indian shooters has impressed Malleswari immensely, and she feels that the current batch of youngsters is one of India’s best hopes.
 
 
 
 
 
 “Shooting will suffer because of reduction in their quota but senior shooters like Jitu Rai and Gagan Narang will use their experience to win medals. Youngsters like Manu Bhaker and Anish have recently won golds at the World Cup and will surely be among the medals,” Malleswari said.
 
 “Boxing has Vikas and Amit as potential medallists while Achanta Sharath Kamal will be India’s best prospects in table tennis. In athletics the standards are high but still Seema Punia, Arpinder Singh, Tejaswin Shankar and 4x400 women’s relay are likely to win.”
