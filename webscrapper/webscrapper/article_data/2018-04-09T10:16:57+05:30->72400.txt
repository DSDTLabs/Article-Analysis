KOLKATA: Kolkata Knight Riders had roped in   to provide stability to their middle-order. He did that job well by playing a useful 25-ball 34, but more than that as a bonus, the Delhi batsman provided his new team two vital breakthroughs with his part-time off-spin to help hosts beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by four wickets with seven balls to spare in their opening match of   11 at the Eden Gardens on Sunday.

 
 
 
 
 KKR have a new team and a new skipper, but there was no change in their game.   once again opened the innings providing the initial fireworks after their spinners - Yadav, Piyush Chawla, along with Narine kept things tight to restrict RCB to 176 for 7 when skipper Dinesh Karthik opted to bowl first on winning the toss.
 
 Narine began by hitting   for a four and six in the first over when KKR began the chase. Although he lost his opening partner   in the next over off  , the West Indian continued to cut loose hitting Woakes for two sixes and two fours in the pacer's next over. He treated India's rising star   with disdain collecting 19 runs off his second over that included two sixes and one four to bring up a 17-ball 50.
 
 It took a former Knight ---Umesh Yadav to come to RCB's rescue as he had Narine bowled as the left-hander was played on trying to negotiate a full toss on the onside.
 
 Skipper Karthik, who shared a 55-run fourth-wicket stand with Rana, stayed till the end to see his side home remaining unbeaten on 36.
