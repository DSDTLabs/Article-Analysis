GURUGRAM: The city faces problems aplenty, and intelligent disposal of waste is just one of them. But clearly, Gurugram must be doing something right if a team of students from   (HBS) is on a visit to understand steps being taken to segregate solid waste. 

 The students were recently in Gurgaon as part of a compulsory first-year course at HBS called ‘FIELD Global Immersion’, conceived so as to provide them with an experience that is hands-on and immersive. 
 
 The students were assigned to explore ways of improving waste management processes and practices at properties of the Vatika Group, their Gurgaon hosts. Out of the classroom and into the field, they were able to glean real-life learnings from their research. 
 
 Vatika Group is one of 157 FIELD  , spanning 14 countries, who together combine to host more than 900 Harvard   students. Speaking of the collaboration,  , professor and faculty head of FIELD at HBS, said the experience is an invaluable one for the young men and women from the business school. 
 
 According to a   report, the Capital alone produces 25,000 tons of domestic waste every day. Manifestly, segregation of solid waste is one of the biggest challenges faced today by urban areas and metropolitan cities. And Gurgaon is no exception.
 
 In an attempt to study ‘waste segregation solutions for a sustainable future’, the HBS team made use of ‘customer behaviour’ analysis and attempted to devise solutions to address sustainability challenges. 
 
 They conducted field research with consumers around the city, pitched ideas to the leadership team, and presented their final recommendations to the Vatika management.
 
 “We hope our proposed solutions prove useful, and would love to stay in touch to see how things progress,” shared Jeremy, an HBS student. “We had an amazing first visit to India, and a large part of that is due to the great experience we had working with the Vatika team,” shared Greta, another of the business school students.
