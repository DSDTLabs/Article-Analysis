CHANDIGARH: Cancelling the environment clearances given by the Punjab government to the Tata Camelot project, the division bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice   observed that these were not in consonance with statutory regulations of environment protection and town planning. They however made it clear that the company may approach the Centre or state authorities for fresh environmental and other clearances required for the project.

 The PIL filed by Sarin Memorial Legal Aid Foundation and Chandigarh-based lawyer Alok Jagga had raised two crucial points. The first was that because the highrise project was in Sukhna lake’s catchment area, it would adversely affect the region’s ecology. It had also submitted that the project ran counter to the Edict of Chandigarh as visualized by the city’s founding architect Le Corbusier.
 
 When the petition was filed, the   had not yet been cleared as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. The foundation had stated that if the project came up, it had the potential to adversely affect Chandigarh’s chances of getting that unique status.
 
 Tata Housing, however, had submitted that the edict had no legal recognition and, therefore, could not be enforced. At any rate, according to the company, the edict would apply to developments within the boundaries of Chandigarh and not beyond that. Tata’s project site is right outside Chandigarh and in Punjab.
 
 “It is obvious that every city has to expand in order to accommodate the growth in population of city. As the horizontal limits of a city are defined, at some point vertical highrise residential buildings have to be constructed to cater to the growing needs for residential space,” the company had argued.
 
 While the judges said that the edict could not be enforced outside Chandigarh, they faulted the environmental clearances given to the project.
 
  The bench had reserved its verdict on October 9, 2015, which was remanded to   by the Supreme Court.
