HYDERABAD: Alli Basha, a 22-year-old civil service aspirant from Nandikotkur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool district, has launched a   campaign to raise money to meet his   coaching expenses.

 Basha’s campaign on Bangalore-based online crowdfunding marketplace   aims to raise Rs 1.12 lakh by May 1. “I hope to join the next batch of IAS aspirants at   in May. The coaching classes will give me a fair chance at competing with other candidates to become an IAS officer,” said Basha, who has so far raised Rs 9,000.
 
 “As my father is an onion merchant and my mother a daily wage labourer, they do not have the financial means to fund my education. I have been able to continue my education solely because of the scholarships that I have secured. My undergraduate degree and PUC education was funded by a Rs 10,000 annual merit scholarship,” said Basha, who is presently awaiting results of the   government’s Group-II recruitment tests.
 
 Speaking about Basha’s journey,  , founder of Fueladream said: “Crowdfunding is appropriate for aspirants like him as the crowd does participate in funding the dreams of bright students.” The platform, which went live in April last year, claims to have raised over Rs 3 croew (0.45mn USD) from over 80 campaigns so far.
