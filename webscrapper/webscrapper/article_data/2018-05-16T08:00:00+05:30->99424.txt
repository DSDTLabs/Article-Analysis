 or   are common, but they leave behind marks, making skin appear dull and scarred. Itâ€™s important that you cleanse, exfoliate and moisturise the skin and keep the pores clean and clear from make-up, dirt and oils to avoid acne. While some look for medical intervention to treat acne, in most cases, home remedies can also work effectively. Here are some ways to prevent and reduce acne at home.

 
 
 Cut a lemon and rub it over the skin. You can also use diluted lemon juice (with water) to cleanse and exfoliate the skin. The acidity in lemon helps to dry out acne and heal the scars.
 
 
 Add a drop of tea tree oil to your regular cleanser. This will help prevent acne breakouts. Tea tree oil also works well to get rid of whiteheads and blackheads.
 
 
 Cinnamon is known for its anti-bacterial properties. Mix three tablespoons of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon and make a face mask. Apply on the face for at least 10 minutes and wash it off thereafter.
 
 
 Green tea is said to have anti-inflammatory properties. Add two tablespoon of green tea leaves to a cup of water and allow them to steep for 10 minutes. Dip a cotton pad in the tea and apply it directly to the skin. Allow it to remain on the skin for 10 minutes.
 
 
 
 Eggs can help to tighten the skin pores. Mix one portion of egg white with honey and apply the mixture on your face. Leave the pack on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Apple cider vinegar has antibiotic properties that can destroy bacteria causing acne. Mix one part apple cider vinegar with two parts distilled water. You can use this lotion as a toner on acne-prone skin.
 
 
 Honey is a natural antiseptic and can help heal acne scars. Dab a small amount of honey over the affected area and leave it for 30 minutes before rinsing it off.
 
 
 You can use ice cubes to soothe inflammation and reduce redness. All you need to do is rub an ice cube on the affected area.
