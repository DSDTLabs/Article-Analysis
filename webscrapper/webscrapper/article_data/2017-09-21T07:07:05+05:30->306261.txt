MUMBAI: The Shivaji memorial project that is to be built inside Arabian Sea is in troubled waters and will be delayed further.

 The bids for the project were received in April and since the lowest bidder was much higher than the base price set by the state the progress on the project has been slow. After a brief lull and trying different ways of bringing down the project cost by negotiating with the bidder, the public works department ( ) has asked the   (IIT) Bombay to conduct a third-party audit of the bid submitted by L&T, the lowest bidder.
 
 In April, the PWD had received a bid from L&T of Rs 3,826 crore to construct the first phase of the Shivaji memorial--Rs 1,326 crore more than the state's estimate of Rs 2,500 crore for the initial phase. A sum of Rs 1,100 crore was earmarked for the second phase.
 
 L&T,   Infrastructure and   were in fray for the project. While Reliance lost in the technical competition round, Shapoorji Pallonji-Afcons quoted a project cost of Rs 4,779 crore. “It has now been decided to ha ve an IIT expert panel to scrutinize the bid submitted by L&T. Depending on their feedback, we will decide about allotting the bid at the higher cost or not,“ said a official.
 
 Vinayak Mete, chairman of the committee that has been constituted to monitor the project, confirmed the move and said that IIT-B will be submitting its report in a month. Officials said that this will definitely delay the project as the department was hoping to start work on the project by October. The ministry of environment and forests has held up permission for the project for want of more clarity on the project and its impact. The memorial will have a temple, a museum, a hospital, an entrance modelled on the Raigad fort.
