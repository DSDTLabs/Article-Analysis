KARNAL: A 35-year-old woman allegedly   herself from a ceiling fan in her house in   on Friday. 

  Gupta, married about 12 years ago, lived with her husband, two duaghters and her in-laws in sector 6. On Friday evening, when one of her daughters returned home from school, nobody answered the doorbell. She then alerted the neighbours who broke the window pane and found Sarika’s body hanging.
 
 Sarika’s relatives who reached Karnal from Delhi on Saturday alleged that her husband and in-laws tortured her for not giving birth to a son.
 
 “She was even physically abused. We are sure that this is a pre-planned murder not suicide. We want all the culprits to be behind bars,” said her uncle.
 
 Police said her death resulted from choking due to hanging as revealed by postmortem report.
