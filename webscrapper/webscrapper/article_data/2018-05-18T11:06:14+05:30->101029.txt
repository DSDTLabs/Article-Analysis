LUCKNOW: SP chief   on Thursday joined ranks with BSP chief   in attacking   for the political developments in   and described the process of government formation as “murder of democracy”.

 
 The SP chief, in a rather poetic tweet, said: “Today people will swear by democracy, today they will murder it. Today misuse of government machinery will again be on display and conscience will be up for sale. Today freedom will suffer another blow”.
 
 Comparing the developments in Karnataka with the functioning of the British Raj in India, Akhilesh later said: “The manner in which the BJP has destroyed democracy in Karnataka must be condemned with all the emphasis. Such incidents are a disgrace to the freedom struggle and the values of the democratic step that India has been proud of.”
