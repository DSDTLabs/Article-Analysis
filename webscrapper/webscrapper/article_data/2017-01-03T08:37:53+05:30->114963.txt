 There are more than 200 hospitals under ASHA in the 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh.
 
 “In spite of the promise made by the chief minister, submission of revised tariff and multiple meetings at the behest of the health minister, the issues are not resolved and consensus could not be attained. After the final meeting we had with the state government representatives on December 13, we received the minutes of the meeting not in line with the discussion held and many of the terms and conditions which were earlier accepted were not mentioned,” said a core committee member from ASHA.
 
 “Though   agree and appreciate the ‘health for all’ initiative, we would like to have a detailed costing exercise conducted by a third party as the industry cannot serve all the categories of patients in subsidised packages where indirect costs of the hospital are not taken into consideration,” the member added. 
 
 Representatives of ASHA has asked for either validation of the costing exercise done by them or constitution of a legally valid costing committee to cover all the costs involved in the healthcare delivery to both EHS and ‘health for all’ schemes.
