Dave had studied in Cept from 1973 to 1980 and later he did his doctorate from the   in Zurich. He had then started teaching as faculty of architecture at Melbourne University in Australia.
 
 Snehal Shah, visiting professor and director of library at Cept, said that Dave had not put any names on the books. “Once the books were donated to CEPT, they merged with other books and people cannot identify which books belonged to him.”

 Shah said that the books donated by Dave mainly belonged to architecture and digitalization.
