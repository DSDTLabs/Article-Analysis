MUMBAI: The mobile phone Internet search that   (32) had done to get a former Indian ace cricketer's residential landline number to stalk his daughter was part of evidence   police submitted in a 147-page charge-sheet filed before a Bandra court on March 6. 

  The charge-sheet included the cricketer's personal manager, his domestic helps and panchs, and evidence in the form of call records retrieved from the caller id of the phone on which Maity made the call threatening to kidnap the cricketer's daughter if she did not marry him. 
 
 Maity's mobile was seized and the   showed how he got landline contact details after an Internet search. "When the manager said his employer's daughter was not at home, Maity said if anybody stopped him from meeting her, he would kidnap her," said the officer.
 
 Bandra police senior inspector   confirmed the charge-sheet.
