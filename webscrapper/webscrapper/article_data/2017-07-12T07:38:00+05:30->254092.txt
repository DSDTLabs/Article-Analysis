 “There have been multiple incidents of gang rape, murder, loot and chain snatching in Gurgaon recently, because of which many no longer feel safe to step out of their homes.

 A memorandum was also submitted to police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar.
 
  “We have demanded the number of cops on roads to be increased, so that there is a sense of security among residents. The patrol vehicles should also be increased,” Tanwar said.
 
 Leader of the   in the Haryana assembly, Kiran Choudhry, also addressed the protestors, blaming CM   for failing to deliver his promises. “Safety of women is at stake and if this is the situation in Gurgaon, one can only imagine the plight of women in far flung areas of this state,” she said.
