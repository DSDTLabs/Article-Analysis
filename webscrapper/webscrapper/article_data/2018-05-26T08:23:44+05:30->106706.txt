DEHRADUN: Chief minister   missed the inauguration of   Lake Festival on Friday as thick smoke cover due to forest fires in the district made it impossible for the chopper, which was supposed to pick him up, to take off.
 
  The CM was to take the chopper from   helipad in Dehradun at 11am. Thereafter, he was scheduled to land at Koti helipad in Tehri district. The chopper travelled to Tehri to drop tourism minister   in the morning but was unable to fly as smoke resulted in low visibility. After the smoke cleared up later in the day, the CM was able to land in Tehri in the evening. Sources said that he took a chopper from Dehradun at 4pm and returned after staying in Tehri for an hour.
