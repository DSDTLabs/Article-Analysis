An all-female cast playing both female and male characters came together to stage a comical play titled 'Biwiyon Ka Madarsa' at IIS University auditorium in Jaipur recently. Interestingly, all the actors in the play were working mothers from Gurgaon’s Mom Theatre Group.

 The play, which has been adapted in Hindi by author and founder of the theatre group   and   alumnus Binod Sharma (also the director of the play), is set in Jaipur and revolves around an old man,   aka  , who brings up a six-year-old girl Husneara to marry her when she grows up. Qatlu alienates her from social life and moulds her emotions as per his wishes. 
 
 Talking about the group, Goyal says, “Our thought behind the launch of this group was to give ladies in Gurgaon a creative corner where they come and discover themselves all over again. It soon became an all mothers’ group.” Geetika also played the character of Sultan Ali, a servant in the play. Talking about her character in the play, she said, “It wasn’t easy for me to adapt to men’s mannerisms. While preparing for this play, I used to observe men walking during my morning walks. We were a little sceptical in the beginning if people would accept us playing men on stage. But going by the reaction of the audience, I think they loved it.”
