BHUBANESWAR: The   has failed to ready a   (SFCPoA) in urban areas, observed the   (CAG) in its report. SFCPoA aims to revamp the existing slums and provide basic infrastructure and other amenities to the urban poor. 

 The audit pointed out that the action plan prepared by the private agencies for   (BMC), Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BeMC) and   (CMC) were not approved by the respective urban bodies because all slums were not covered. The audit data on sample basis was obtained from these three urban bodies and Jajpur municipality that did have any action plan for slum improvement. 
 
 The CAG report said since no survey was carried out in the slums in a systematic and time-bound manner, the BMC, BeMC and CMC failed to submit the SFCPoA to the state-level steering committee for approval. Survey of the slums is carried out to identify genuine beneficiaries. It contains basic information such as land status, livelihood options and demographic and social profile. But, the audit found that there was no information on socio-economic status of 125 slums out of 987.
