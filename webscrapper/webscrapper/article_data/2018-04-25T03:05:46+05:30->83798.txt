NOIDA: As many as nine bullets were lodged in the body of gangster Balraj  , who was shot dead on Monday by special task force teams of Haryana and UP police. 

 Police are now relying on clips captured on the   cameras of Bikaner Sweets, where the encounter took place, to identify the two accomplices of Bhati who fled. The sequence of events towards the latter half of the encounter — after the chase — was recorded in the cameras of the sweet shop in Sector 41.
 
 The postmortem report of Bhati said he had been hit in the chest, abdomen and feet. His body was handed over to his family members in Delhi on Monday night.
 
 STF officers cited the seven-minute CCTV footage and said that the two aides of Bhati who fled, appeared to be over 35 years of age. “They were members of his gang. We are trying to identify them from their build and face, but the footage is blurred. We have some names, but they have to be confirmed,” said additional SP, UP STF, Rajkumar Mishra.
 
 Investigators have found the Maruti Swift (HR72D8351) in which Bhati and his aides were travelling was registered in the name of one Maniram, a resident of Gurgaon’s Damdama area. “It has to be seen if the vehicle actually belongs to him or the number is fake,” Mishra said.
 
 Police are also examining if the two guns recovered from Bhati — a 9mm carbine and a 9mm pistol — were stolen.
 
 According to STF officers, Bhati had a role in the murder of BJP leader  , who was gunned down in Bisrakh area last year.
