BHOPAL:   (CAG) has unearthed   to the tune of Rs 12 crore in various works and purchases at the   ( ) between 2013 and 2015.

 Though a committee was constituted in this regard, no accountability was fixed. According to sources in the institute, the report found discrepancies in construction works including that of badminton court, purchase of books for library and outsourcing of employees. TOI possesses a copy of the report. The institute authorities claim that they have submitted a reply to CAG in this regard. The report pinpoints that MANIT had to bear a loss of Rs 3.44 crore owing to change in nature of work and delay in construction work. Construction of academic building, classrooms, barracks and other miscellaneous works were reviewed by the auditors.
 
 According to the agreement, the work was supposed to be completed in 7 months after it was started on November 16, 2010. However, the work could not be finished, as the concerned construction agency was given fresh deadline with 10% extra cost over and above the original cost. The agency was given another three months to complete the work with the fresh deadline of September 15, 2011.
 
 MANIT repeatedly extended the deadline, which escalated the original cost. The last deadline given to the agency was December 31, 2014. CAG found that the construction cost was Rs 16.21 crore, but it gradually increased to Rs 30.85 crore owing to delay in the work. Auditors also found that the penalty for the delay in work was also charged less than the prescribed amount, due to which MANIT suffered a loss of Rs 3.44 crore. Besides, CAG has also questioned the payment of extra Rs 14.64 crore for the construction work.
 
 CAG has also raised the issue of missing 31,458 books and 29 CDs worth Rs 1.37 crore. CAG stated that MANIT authorities did not carry out any physical verification of the books and study material after 2010. Surprisingly, committees were formed for physical verification between 2013 and 2015, but it was never done. According to rule, physical verification should have been done once in every three years.
 
 CAG has also raised objection over outsourcing of employees in MANIT. It is mentioned in the report that ideally 26 employees should have been outsourced, but MANIT went on outsourcing for 175 posts. It was also pointed that for the category of administrative staff (Group-C) 27 extra employees were recruited. Under this category, sanctioned posts were 235, but MANIT recruited 262 employees.
 
 Similarly, the security agency, which was hired for 11 months in 2013 with 180 employees, kept on working till August 31, 2015. CAG has clearly stated that Rs 5.43 crore was paid to the agency. For the badminton court, CAG pointed out that Rs 61.78 lakh was paid “unnecessarily”. Besides, payment of Rs 2.78 lakh in other construction works was also questioned.
 
 When contacted, MANIT engineer RK Khare first refused to admit that there was any CAG report. However, when he was shown its copy he recalled it. “We had submitted our reply at that time and there was no issue left. Everything was done according to rules and regulations,” said Khare. Surprisingly, Khare, who was questioned in the alleged discrepancies, has been recently made the state officer of MANIT.
