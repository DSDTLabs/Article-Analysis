Director   believes it is tough to live up to one's preset expectations in any industry with the idea of leaving a mark. 

 He said he does not believe in venturing into a space thinking that his work would end up setting a benchmark. 
 
  
  
 "I really believe there are happy accidents in life... Things just turn out the way they do, you kind of looking back wonder that may be pioneers maybe we set a trend," he said
 
 "Maybe we impacted the work in someway. But it's not something you start off with thinking because if you do that I don't think you live up to it," Karan told on the sidelines of the ongoing fashion show. 
 
 The director, who is considered a fashion icon, says his walk on the ramp seemed like a '10-minute party' to him. 
 
 "It's very flattering to be a showstopper, I hope people like it as I would hate to be an insipid inspiration for anyone. The clothes were flamboyant and extravagant," he told reporters earlier. 
 
 "I think men should never shy away from shining (bling). I think it's their way of expressing their soul. They should not feel that wearing plain clothes is the only way forward," the director adds. 
 
 Karan also lauded   star   for his sense of style and christened him the 'brand ambassador of edgy fashion'. 
 
 "When there's Ranveer Singh in the industry, whatever you do people will accept it. He has really raised the bar in men's fashion quite high. I applaud and adore him for it. He has become the brand ambassador of edgy fashion."
