New Delhi: Several judges on   panels are calling for a rethink of the weightage system in the admission process. The current 25% weightage to certificates is “too much” in a talent-based activity, they argue. A three-year window for certificates also works against a student who is talented but has no documents to show of his public   in the last three years. 

 According to a judge of an ECA final panel, talented students suffer despite a good performance in the trials. “In performance activities, a person can take part in many competitions and collect certificates. But if their performance is sub-par in the trials, they shouldn’t be ranked high. The decision should be more performance-based than document-based. But these are university rules,” she said. 
 
 Amrita Bajaj, deputy dean of students welfare at  , said that even now if a student with a good performance and no certificate is tied in marks with one who has scored more in certificates but less in performance, the student with higher marks in trials is ranked higher. 
 
 The judge also said many students stayed away from extracurricular activities in classes X, XI and XII because of exam pressure. “We hope next time the three-year window is increased a little bit.” Bajaj said students with older certificates but better performance were marked accordingly.
 
 Teachers are unhappy with the 15% cutoff exemption limit for colleges. “A candidate was ranked number one for his performance but had an aggregate of 74%. No course in the college has that low a cutoff. We are okay with taking such a student for our college society but are restricted by university rules,” said a teacher.
 
 Some times even students with fake certificates are given a chance if their performance is exceptional, said sources. A university official said though such students should be disqualified, they were given a chance to compete on humanitarian grounds though fake certificates were not counted.
