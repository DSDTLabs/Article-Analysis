RODE (MOGA): Jarnail Singh  , the Damdami   head killed in   in 1984, was described as a martyr on Thursday by representatives of major Sikh organisations attending the inauguration of a gurdwara built in memory of the slain militant in his native village of Rode, in Punjabâ€™s Moga district.

 
 The representatives included the heads of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Managing Committee, Damdami Taksal and the jathedars of the five Sikh takhts. The proceedings, dominated by discussions on the storming of the   and the killing of Bhindranwale in Amritsar in June 1984, saw the representatives accuse the then Union government headed by Indira Gandhi of denigrating the Sikh shrine.
 
 Gurdwara Sant Khalsa has been built by Damdami Taksal at the behest of its chief, Harman Singh Dhumma. Bhindranwale was killed on June 6, 1984, during an   operation to flush out Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.
