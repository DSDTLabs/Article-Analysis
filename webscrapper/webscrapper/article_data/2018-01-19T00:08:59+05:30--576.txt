done... Nashik: The automating development control regulations (Auto DCR) system will be completely digitalised and a new system will be in place by February 15 resolving all issues of builders and architects who have been complaining of discrepancies in the system. The NMC has started online system of Auto DCR developed by a Pune-based private firm for submission of building plans. Though the builders and architects were given a demonstration of the system on Wednesday by the NMC on how to submit building plans online for Auto DCR approval, they were not satisfied. The city’s Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR) has recently been introduced. There are already some issues which are pending with the government for update. Hence, it will take some time for complete improvement of the system. On Thursday, the associations of architects and builders met municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna with their grievances. They complained that 648 cases were pending for approval under Auto DCR. But Krishna said only 220 cases were pending and that too because of certain problems in the system regarding interpretation of provisions in the DCPR. He said the town planning department and Credai will prepare a common list. “They had major problem with the building plan submitting centre which the company was to establish. On February 15, Credai will provide the manpower and all cases will be resolved. The company will set up the centre by February 15. Everything will be online, including digital signature. From February 15, new digital system will be in place,” Krishna said.
