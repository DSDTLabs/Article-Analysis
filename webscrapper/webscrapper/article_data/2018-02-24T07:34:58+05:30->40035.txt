 While some people saw Veenu’s presence at the event as preparation for the parliamentary elections in 2019 against her relative Union minister  , she dismissed the speculations.
 
 Veenu said she was more concerned for the safety of people and no politics should be read into her involvement in the campaign.
 
 Meanwhile, SSP Singla denied giving special treatment to the finance minister’s wife. He said, “As the campaign is for a social cause, we called Veenu as her appeal will have more bearing, especially on mothers who will be motivated to stop their adolescent children from driving. She is making such appeals during her visits to various localities.”
