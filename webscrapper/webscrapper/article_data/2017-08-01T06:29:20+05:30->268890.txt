Satish Aakhand had just finished his first year in mechanical engineering at a Nagpur college when the griping stomach aches and breathlessness started. A local doctor diagnosed right away that the problem lay with his heart. 

  "I rushed back home to   where a doctor said I could be treated with life-long medication. But medicines gave me relief for barely 15 days,'' said Satish, who belongs to a farming family.
 
 This was in November 2016. It took two more months and visits to several doctors before he got a full diagnosis at  's  : He had a heart failure and needed a transplant. He registered for transplant on January 9 and got a donation after six months, on June 22. "I am grateful a Mumbai family donated their dear one's organs,'' he said over phone from Washim.
