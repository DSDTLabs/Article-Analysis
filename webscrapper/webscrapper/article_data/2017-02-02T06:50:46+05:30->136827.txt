SALURU (VIZIANAGARAM): At least seven Odisha State Armed Police (OSAP) personnel were killed and another six injured in a   triggered by naxals at   village on the Sunki ghat road, about three km from the AP border on Wednesday evening.

 Sources said 15 OSAP personnel, mostly drivers, were going from Koraput to Bhubaneswar in a minivan when the landmine was triggered. 
 
 The incident happened between 5 pm to 5.30 pm at a distance of 3 km from Panasamanuguddi and Roddavalasa villages of Viziangaram district on the AP border. 
 
 The area is said to be severely infested by Maoists. According to sources, rescue teams along with special operations group (SOG) commandos reached the spot by the night and recovered seven bodies. “Five police personnel who were severely injured were given first aid at Saluru hospital and they were slated to be shifted to Visakhapatnam by late night,” anti-naxal operations OSD   told TOI.
