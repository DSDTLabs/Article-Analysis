BERHAMPUR: The majority of hostel boarders of the government-run  , located in Tillory under Kandhamal district's Daringibadi block, who had left the hostel after allegedly being given inferior quality food by the school authorities two days ago, are yet to return.

 As many as 84 girls - all students of classes IX and X - had left the hostel on Friday night and returned to their homes. They accused the headmaster-cum superintendent of the school of supplying them with poor quality food and not following the set menu. "We had aired our grievances to the headmaster earlier and he had promised to fulfil our demands by July 25," the inmates said in a letter pasted on the wall of the hostel before they left.
 
 Collector (Kandhamal) Brundha D has asked district welfare officer (DWO)   to conduct an inquiry into the matter. Bharimalla visited the hostel on Saturday and said 24 of the 84 students who had left the hostel had already returned. He also said he would try to convince the remaining students to return.
 
 "We went to the houses of almost all the students and convinced their parents to send theirs wards back to the hostel," Bharimalla said, adding, "I have conducted an inquiry into the matter and will submit a report to the collector on Monday." 
 
 Bharimalla said he had also talked to headmaster   about the students' allegations.
