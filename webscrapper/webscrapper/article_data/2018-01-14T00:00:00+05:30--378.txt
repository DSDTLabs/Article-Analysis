 While you might think it’s just another nonsensical millennial concept, it’s actually a legit condition that you may be prone to. Alcohol basically slows down your nervous system making you less anxious and uninhibited. The next day though, as the alcohol makes its way out of your body, the withdrawal messes with the levels of serotonin, the feel-good neurotransmitter in your brain, resulting in an uncontrollable wave of negativity and melancholy. While this commonly affects people who are already prone to feelings of anxiety and depression, people unaware of these tendencies might experience it as well. 
 
 
 
 Water is the cure to all things body-related, and when it comes to avoiding a nasty hangover, H20 is your best friend.
