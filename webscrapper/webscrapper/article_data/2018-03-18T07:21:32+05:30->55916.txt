PANAJI: The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change has decided that construction   with a built-up area of up to 50,000 sqm will now be exempt from obtaining environmental clearances. 

 The Union ministry has published a draft notification amending the criteria for obtaining environmental clearance and has sought objections or feedback within 60 days.
 
 At present,   projects or buildings with a built-up area of 20,000 sqm require environmental clearances prior to start of the project.
 
 “The central government is streamlining permissions for buildings and construction sector while simultaneously strengthening efforts to improve environment through greater objectivity and transparency,” the draft notification said. “It is important to streamline the process to achieve housing for all by 2022 with the objective of making available affordable housing to weaker section in urban areas.”
 
 As per the draft notification, construction projects with a built up area of 5,000 sq m to 20,000 sqm will have to submit a self-declaration stating that the project will comply with the environmental conditions laid down by the Union ministry. The self-declaration has to be submitted along with the application for   permissions. 
 
 “The current environmental regime covers buildings and constructions of above 20,000 sqm of built up area. It is proposed to increase the threshold value to 50,000 sqm of built up area based on objective principles and the need for protecting the environment,” the draft notification said.
 
  The relaxed norms do not apply for construction projects such as industrial sheds, universities, colleges, hostel for educational institutions, but such buildings shall ensure sustainable environmental management including solid and liquid waste and implement environmental conditions.
