RANCHI: The Ranchi district health authority has decided to crack its whip on private hospitals that are flouting the Clinical Establishment Act. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr S S   on Friday dispatched a letter to private hospitals and nursing homes across the state capital and districts, directing them to register themselves under the central Act by January 15. 

 "We have written to each private hospital, nursing home and clinics that are operational in the district. Those who do not adhere to the Act until the given time will be strongly dealt with," Harijan said.
 
 According to data available with Ranchi civil surgeon's office, the district has a little over 450 private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. Of them, only 200 have registered themselves under the Act ever since it was promulgated in 2010.
 
 The 2010 regulations mandate each public and privately owned (and managed) health establishments for registration and submit a detailed compliance report on the services, facility and infrastructure provided in their premises. 
 
 However, it has been found that several hospitals in the district have been openly flouting regulations despite the health department's repeated reminders. 
 
 "The hospitals have to show their income and services including number of beds, medical conditions it deals with and the infrastructure that is available to them," an official in the Ranchi civil surgeon's office said. 
 
 Besides concealing the services offered, private hospitals are also flouting the biomedical waste management guidelines. 
 
 "The Clinical Establishment Act is being enforced statewide. Many hospitals have complied. The remaining will be brought under the net shortly," director of state health services Dr   claimed.
 
 Meanwhile, health minister   on Friday took stock of the situation at   (Rims). In an hour-long meeting with Rims administration,   gave his approval to the pending promotions of several teaching faculty at the medical college hospital.
