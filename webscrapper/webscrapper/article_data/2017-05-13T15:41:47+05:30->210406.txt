In 2008, J.K. Rowling had donated a short work of fiction, set in the  , to an auction to raise funds for English PEN, a foundation that promotes the freedom to write and read and Dyslexia action. It earned £25,000 according to the BBC, about Rs 20 lakh.

 This story was stolen from a property Howard Road, Kings Heath during a break-in between April 13 and 24, West Midlands Police said.
 
 It was handwritten by J.K. Rowling herself, on a postcard, approximately A5 sized and only about 800 words long. It was set before Harry was born and starred his father,  , and his Godfather,   as they're confronted by muggle policemen. Both beloved characters were teenagers and the most of the tale involves them talking to the policemen; there is some slight action involving Death Eaters.
 
 The last words on the piece of paper are, "From the prequel I am not working on -- but that was fun!".
 
 According to an IANS report, the investigating officer said, “The only people who will buy this unique piece are true   fans. We are appealing to anyone who sees, or is offered this item for sale, to contact police."
 
 J.K. Rowling has appealed to her fans on Twitter not to buy the prequel stolen in burglary.
