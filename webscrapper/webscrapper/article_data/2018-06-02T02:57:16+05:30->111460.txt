NEW DELHI:  , a   candidate in the 2013 Delhi elections who was accused of violating the model code of conduct, has been acquitted.

 It was alleged that Gupta had taken out a procession despite a restraining order by the authorities. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate  , however, said mere mental annoyance of the authorities was not enough to attract punishment, especially when there was no proof that the procession had led to obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person.
 
 Gupta was booked under IPC 188, which stipulates punishment for disobeying an order promulgated by a public servant. The then executive magistrate   had claimed that Gupta, on November 29, 2013, took out a procession with about 150-200 people in Karampura, New Moti Nagar and didn’t show any permission, claiming it was just a door-to-door campaign.
 
 After examining the code of conduct, the court said the foundation of the case itself was wrong as the accused was to only inform the authority about the procession.
 
 The court also said the model code of conduct was “a document meant for guidance of political parties and candidates” and not an order covered by IPC 188.
