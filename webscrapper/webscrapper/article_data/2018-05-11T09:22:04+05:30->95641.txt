CHANDIGARH: Punjab and   president   has purchased a 0001 number worth Rs 6.9 lakh for the Toyota Land Cruiser car he gifted to his son,  , on his wedding.

 
 He bought this vanity registration number of the CH-01-BS series against a reserve price of Rs 50,000 before the e-auction closed here on Thursday after three days. In 2010, Sidhu had purchased another 0001 number worth Rs 5.7 lakh for a CH-01-AE series   S Class 350.
 
 Number 0007 was the second most sought after.   bought it for Rs 2.56 lakh against a reserve price of Rs 30,000. Number 0003 was sold to Sunil Gupta for Rs 2.44 lakh and 0008 to   for Rs 1.50 lakh against the same reserve price.

From the auction in which 251 bidders took part, the office made a revenue of Rs 62.16 lakh.
 
 Over the last few years, the craze for the vanity number has declined, and many of these go unsold in auctions. Successful bidders must both register their vehicle and deposit the balance bidding amount within a month from the auction, failing which they pay a 10% annual penalty, besides 10% annual interest on this sum until full payment. During the last auction on February 22, number 0001 of the series CH-01-BR went for Rs 5.25 lakh against a reserve price of Rs 50,000. Raffles   took it for a Porsche.
