THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The arrest of  , two key accused in the  , turned out to be a   for the government.

 While chief minister   and CPM leaders lauded the police for arresting the duo from a courtroom in Kochi, the opposition found fault with the police action.
 
 Vijayan, who congratulated the police, asked the critics whose interests they were protecting. Minister for cultural affairs A K Balan justified the police action. “It has now become clear that we'll smoke such elements out irrespective of where they hide,“ he said in a Facebook post.
 
 “There was no summons to the accused from the court and there was no application for surrender before that court,“ the minister said, adding that the accused had intruded and tried to hide in the courtroom with the help of his accomplic es. How can he stand in the dock without the court's directive?“ Balan asked. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan sought a clarification from the critics on how they treated the safety of the survivor.
 
 “Congress and BJP are dejected as their plan to use the delay in arrest to criticise the government failed,“ he said.
 
 Opposition leader   said though the police were lucky enough to nab Pulsar Suni, the manner in he was arrested was a shame.
 
 “It exposes the lapses in investigation. The accused had been hanging around in Kochi for the past six days, and yet he could not be arrested, he said, adding that the accused managing to enter the court exposed the police's inefficiency.
 
 KPCC president V M Sudheeran said Suni managing to enter the court exposed the lapses in the policing system.
 
 BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan said arresting a key accused from a court room showed the failure of the police.
