PANAJI: Terming it a government formed on a corrupt alliance,   on Monday said that the current government under   is ‘unstable and temporary’. 

 “The peoples’ verdict was against the BJP. They formed the government after being reduced to 13 seats and I believe it is nothing but a corrupt compromise. The smaller parties who won the mandate on anti-BJP call will have to answer to the public who is angry,” Raut said, adding that the state would remain unstable for the time being and there might be a new chief minister in the distant future.
 
 Refusing to comment on   extending its support to BJP, Raut attacked  , stating that the Goa Forward MLA sold the people’s mandate. 
 
 “Vijai Sardesai fought the elections against BJP and openly criticized Manohar Parrikar, but he and the other two MLAs of his party joined hands with BJP post elections. The independent MLAs did the same. They should tell what they think about the people of Goa.”
 
 Commenting on the elevation of Yogi Adityanath by BJP as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Raut said that now the Ram Temple should be constructed. 
 
 “It is BJP’s decision to appoint anyone they want as the chief minister. They now enjoy the majority at centre as well as state. Now they need to show courage and build the Ram Temple,” Raut added.
