JALANDHAR:   Kaur, a student of St Joseph’s Convent School, Cantt Road,  , bagged second position in India in ICSE Class X exams, whose results were announced on Monday.

 “I had worked hard and expected to score more than 90%. But bagging second position in the country has come as a surprise,” said jubilant Jasmine at her residence in Garha.
 
 Her father   is a deputy superintendent of police, posted in the Vigilance Bureau at Kapurthala and mother Gurpreet Kaur is lecturer in a government senior secondary school in Jalandhar.
 
 “I used to study 7-8 hours daily to have complete grasp on all the subjects,” she said while thanking her teachers for the success. She said she had taken admission in the non-medical stream in local HMV College, and unlike several other toppers, she has not yet decided her specific aim in life. “I only know one thing that I want to become a legend, whatever I do. What I shall be doing in studies will be decided later,” she said.
