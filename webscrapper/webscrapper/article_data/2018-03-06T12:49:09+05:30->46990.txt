BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission ( ) received 849 objections about recently-organised preliminary exam. The candidates had submitted a memorandum to officials at the CM house last week alleging scam. Alleging several answers in keys were wrong, the   aspirants demanded clarification from the commission.

 According to PSC officials, 750 objections were regarding general awareness paper and only 99 objections about the second paper. 
 
 After organising the exam, the commission uploaded correct keys to enable students to cross-check their answers. The commission allows candidates to raise objections to answers in the model answer key, but charges Rs 100 per objection. Students had claimed there were around 15 incorrect answers in the first paper.
 
 With 15 incorrect answers having been detected so far, each student would have to shell out a minimum of Rs 1,500, if they raise objections. The deadline for submitting objections was March 3. The commission officials said they received similar number of objections every year.
 
 Students had also raised question over the money charged from them. “We had to pay for wrong answers. Besides, there is a portal charge. This is objectionable,” said an aspirant.
 
 A candidate said it is a matter of concern for all candidates. “This is not acceptable. Several candidates spent many years of their life to prepare for PSC exams. It is quite discouraging,” said another candidate.
 
 Preliminary exam for various positions in the state government was held on February 18 and the model answer key was published on the commission’s portal five days later.
 
 The protests had started after the PSC uploaded answers keys and candidates started highlighting incorrect answers in the key, calling it a conspiracy by the commission. 
 
 On February 23, PSC aspirants held protests in   and   and submitted letters to the authorities seeking intervention in the matter.
