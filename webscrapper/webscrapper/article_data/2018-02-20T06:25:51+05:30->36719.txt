CHENNAI: With a 58 % increase in number of monthly concession   after   fare revision, Metropolitan Transport Corporation’s   has stabilised this week.

 From 50,000 in last December, sale of 1,000 worth monthly passes has increased to 79,000 this month, said an   official. “This has in turn increased our daily revenue up to 2.9 crore”. Rates of these passes did not change even after the fare revision went by 67 % in January third week. 
 
 The demand for these passes shot up even further after MTC decided to temporarily scrape 50 worth daily passes. 
 
 Besides regular MTC users, officials said bulk purchases by corporate houses in order to avoid delays faced by their employees have also contributed to the steep hike in sales figures. MTC ‘s revenue has stabilised at a time when other state transport corporations were witnessing a 15 % loss in estimated daily revenue. 
 
 However, MTC was no exception when it came to drop in number of passengers. From 42 lakhs, the average daily footfall has reduced to 38 lakhs this week.
