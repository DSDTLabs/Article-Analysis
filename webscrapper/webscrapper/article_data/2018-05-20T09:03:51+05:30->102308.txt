HYDERABAD: Taking cognizance of a letter written by a class 7 student of St Ann’s high school,   minister   has requested   district collector and   officials to work towards beautifying a water body near the RTO office on Medchal road.“Thanks Niyati for your concern about the neighbourhood pond. Request @Collector-MDL and @HMDA_Gov to jointly address the issue and make efforts to beautify the lake,” KTR tweeted on Saturday.

 
 The letter, written by Niyati, who resides near the water body, points out how the pond has now turned into a cesspool due to rapid urbanisation.
 
 “This is to bring to your kind attention that nearby residents are trying relentlessly to save the aforesaid pond from further decay, but in vain. The pond has become a favourite spot for the garbage dumping and sewage discharge and polluted water has led to growth of water hyacinth covering almost half of it (pond),” reads the letter.
