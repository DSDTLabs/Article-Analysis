AHMEDABAD: Former Gujarat CM Shankersinh   is all set to split the   state unit on his 77th birthday on Friday. It will come as a body blow to the main opposition party and a boon for the ruling BJP ahead of the November assembly polls.

 Vaghela, a BJP rebel who had merged his Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) with Congress 17 years back, is holding a gathering of supporters at Gandhinagar town hall on Friday to celebrate his birthday and announce his plans which may substantially alter the political course in PM Narendra Modi’s home state.
 
 While some of his loyal MLAs are keen on returning to BJP, Vaghela is nurturing plans to spearhead a third front, which may include Nationalist Congress Party, JD (U) and emerging young turks like Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakore and Jignesh Mewani, who have become the rallying points for Patidars, Thakores and Dalits, respectively.
 
 
 
 Also in his scheme of things is the lone Janata Dal (United) MLA Chhotu Vasava, a tribal strongman. But a likely return to BJP of the entire RJP faction is also a matter of intense speculation.
 
 Vaghela is miffed with Congress, which turned down his demand that he be declared the face of the party’s campaign and the CM candidate in the assembly polls. His last-ditch meetings with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul failed to achieve desired results and it was Sonia’s political secretary Ahmed Patel who finally conveyed to him that projecting him as a leader would upset the original Congressmen, viz. state party chief Bharatsinh Solanki and two former leaders of opposition in the assembly, Shaktisinh Gohil and Arjun Modhwadia.
