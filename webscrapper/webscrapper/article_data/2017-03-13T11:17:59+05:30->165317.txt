PANAJI: When the new government takes office, the state bureaucracy will be ready with the state budget for 2017-18, as the   has completed the budget exercise. Sources said that the finance department has left the planning on capital estimates and expenditure to the new government. 

 The budget for the state is expected to be presented in the last week of March.
 
 Given the lack of revenue sources, government officials say that a coalition government could put further pressure on fiscal discipline if stress is laid on creation of more government jobs.
 
 “All departments were directed to prepare their respective budget proposals for the year. Since the fiscal position is not so strong, the budget exercise has focused on revenue. We have kept capital expenditure and policies for the new ministers to take a call on,” a government official said.
 
 With the results of the 2017 assembly elections out, the new government is likely to take oath within the next seven days, giving the incoming government less than 10 days to table the budget before March 31 on the floor of the house.
 
 “The exercise is ready. Due to the 7th pay commission, the revenue component will go up. There is also a component on power purchase. The danger, however, is that in a coalition government, where there are many first time ministers, they have certain priorities that may make fiscal discipline difficult,” a government official said.
 
 All the departments have provided proposals for revenue allocations, probable new schemes and infrastructure works in various parts of the state.
