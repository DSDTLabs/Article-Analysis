JALANDHAR: Trade of milch cows from Punjab has improved in the last over six months after Rajpura-based Gau Raksha Dal chief   was arrested by police on charges of extortion, terrorizing cow traders and even sodomy. However, the business is still not half of where it had reached around three years ago. 

 “Things improved as other cow vigilante groups also fell silent after Satish Kumar, who was actually running a big extortion racket in the name of cow protection, was booked and arrested last year. Before that for a couple of years these groups openly indulged in violence as SAD-BJP government and police treated them with kid gloves even as video clips of their violence were handed over to then Punjab chief minister  ,” said Progressive Dairy Farmers Association (PDFA) president   Singh. “Badal government took action only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the issue,” he said. 
 
 “Now traders from other states have started coming to Punjab and the trading is likely to have annual turnover of worth around Rs 1,000 crore which it had reached down to around Rs 200-250 crores in 2015-16 from Rs 2,500 crore by year 2014. The incident of murder of a cow trader in Rajasthan by a so called cow protection group has again created fears among traders, especially Muslim traders, in other states and they have shared these with us,” he said. 
 
 Daljit held that the example of Punjab was enough to show that just one strict action against the cow vigilante groups could set the things right. “Earlier they used to extort money in Punjab and would also thrash traders,” he said. 
 
 However, he held that process of issuing no-objection certificates was still a cumbersome procedure and was discouraging genuine traders of milch cow. “State government needs to help dairy farmers by removing extra glitches as Punjab had become biggest exporter of milch cows to other states after dairy farmers here worked hard to improve the milk yield,” he said.
