Kolkata: Prodded by Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool Congress on Sunday indicated it will demand a dicussion on the Centre’s attempt to link   cards to school midday meal (MDM) programme on the first day of the second phase of the Budget session, which starts on March 9. 

 “Notice will be given under Rule 267, which provides for suspension of all business to debate a subject,” said Trinamool national spoksperson Derek O’Brien. 
 
 The HRD ministry has said cook-cum-helpers working under the midday meal scheme as well as student beneficiaries will be required to have Aadhaar cards to avail the facility. Those not yet enrolled have been given time till June 30.
 
 Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had earlier slammed the move. “Now, even infants (0-5 years) will need Aadhaar cards? Aadhaar card for midday meals and ICDS (Integrated Child Development Scheme)? Shocking!” she had tweeted.
 
 On Sunday, Trinamool also indicated it will form employees’ unions in the railway, banks and insurance companies in a bid to tap the huge workforce base in these sectors. “On the directions of party supremo, we have decided to form employees’ union in the Indian Railways,” party vice-president Mukul Roy said.
 
 “We will try to ensure that the rights and benefits of employees in these sectors are maintained through negotiations with the employers instead of going on strikes and calling bandhs,” he said.
 
 Roy said the process for getting the trade union bodies registered would begin soon.
