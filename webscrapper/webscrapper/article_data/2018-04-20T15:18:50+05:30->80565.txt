BENGALURU: The amount of cash and quantity of liquor seized by election authorities for alleged model code of conduct violations in the run-up to the May 12   have already surpassed the haul during the 2013 elections.

 
 “While in 2013, about Rs 14 crore cash was seized during the entire poll season, the haul this time has crossed Rs 34 crore. The same is the case with liquor. While in 2013, 68,000 litres of alcohol were seized, the haul now stands at 1.9 lakh litres,” chief electoral officer   said on Thursday.
 
 While no gold was seized during the last assembly elections, about 15 kg gold worth Rs 3.7 crore has been seized this time, he added.
 
 The cash and liquor confiscation during this season has also exceeded related figures from the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in  .
 
 Kumar said the reason for the huge haul could be better monitoring or more money flowing in this elections.
 
 Other seized materials like saris, laptops and household goods were worth about Rs 19 crore, said   officials. The seized materials also included shawls, T-shirts, calendars, key chains, 120 flag staff and 76 burqas.
