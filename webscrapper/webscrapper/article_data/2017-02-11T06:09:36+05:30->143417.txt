AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Technological University (GTU) on Friday issued a show-cause notice to   at Viramgam. 

 The move came after a number of students complained against the institute in a letter to vice-chancellor  , over the lack of adequate infrastructure at the institute. 
 
 The students alleged that the institute did not have adequate faculty members or even a permanent principal. Moreover, while there are laboratories, there is no equipment to perform practical experiments.
 
 GTU ordered the formation of a committee to further probe the matter.   and senior professors in GTU affiliated institutes are part of the committee. Based on the report of the committee, appropriate action will be taken against the college management.
