BENGALURU: A 38-year-old woman threw her two minor daughters into a pond in   on Saturday morning and later jumped into it herself.

 
 Hearing their screams, men working in a nearby field rushed to the spot and rescued V   but her daughters V Divya, 5, and V Deeksha, 3, had died. She was reportedly upset over a personal matter.
 
 Sumitra was shifted to the Chikkaballapura government hospital and her condition is stable, police said.
 
 Around 8.30am, Sumitra came out of her house in   with both daughters, police said.
 
 “Sumitra may have fought with her husband  , an agriculturist. Neighbours had no clue what she was up to. We’re waiting for statements from Sumitra’s parents and other family members. We’ll question her husband too,” they added.
