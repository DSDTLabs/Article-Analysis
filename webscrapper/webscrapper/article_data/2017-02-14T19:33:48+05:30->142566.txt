The music of West Africa’s Samblas is unimaginably rich. Their talking xylophone can vouch for that! World-renowned  , who plays this instrument, called the  , says that the Samblas compose music for every occasion. “Any task carried out by the community is accompanied by music. What outsiders consider to be beautiful music is in reality the   language transposed into music.”

 If you’re wondering if you’ll ever get a chance to listen to this xylophone with hollow gourds for resonators, you might want to seize the opportunity this Sunday, when Mamadou can interest you in its distinct sound at   at 6.30 pm.
 
 Born into a Griot family in Burkina Faso, known for their tradition of practising storytelling and music-making, Mamadou learnt the ropes from his father and elder brothers, all accomplished musicians. But it was his teacher Daouda Diabate’s ‘difficult technique’ that saw him master the art of creating the impression of three balafonists playing together.
 
 But it was Mamadou’s key decision to leave home at just eleven, to widen his musical horizon, that got him in touch with other traditional instruments like the ngoni, a string instrument from West Africa, that he’ll also play on Sunday. “This isn’t my ‘family instrument’, but I love improvising with melodies on it,” he quips.
 
 Mamadou will perform at Sunday’s sufi concert, Ruhaniyat, collaborating with Indian folk singer Kachra Khan and the Manganiyars from Rajasthan. “I've never met them before, so I’m looking forward to the music we’ll make together,” says Mamadou, hoping he can do an impromptu jam with the clan and present glimpses of Sambla music to the audience.
