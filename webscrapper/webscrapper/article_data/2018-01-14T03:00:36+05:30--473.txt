THANE: Four months after he was swept away into the nullah near his house at  , the mortal remains of 27-year-old Ajay  , the sole missing person in the torrential rains of August 29, 2017, was handed over to his family on Friday. 

 It is learnt that Athaval's body was fished out from the Nhava Sheva area early September. As the body was decomposed and beyond recognition, the Uran police decided to conduct a DNA test. 
 
 Balwant Singh, relative of the deceased said, “On September 11, we got a call from   police station asking us to visit a hospital in   to identify a body. The next day we went to the hospital. Ajay’s mother and elder brother were called to give their blood samples. We kept inquiring with the officials but in vain.” On Thursday, the results of the DNA test were revealed which showed that it matched with that of Athaval’s 70-yearold mother. 
 
 A civic official said, “There was another family from Panvel who claimed that the body belonged to them. So the DNA reports took time. The body was handed over to the family on Friday for the last rites.” It is believed that Athaval, known as   by his loved ones, slipped and fell into an adjoining nullah near his slum tenement at   when he went to help his neighbours during the deluge. 
 
 Athaval is survived by his mother,  , his wife and three daughters of aged eight, three and one.
