KOZHIKODE: The   order, which legalized  , goes against the faith of the believers of different religions in India, said Kanthapuram  , the general secretary of the  .

 In a statement issued here, the Sunni leader said the order was against the citizens’ ‘right to live’ and demanded that it should be withdrawn.
 
 
 “Majority of the people in India believe that it is the prerogative of God to take decision on birth, life and death of human beings. It has been the traditional belief in India that only God who gave life
 
 has the right to take it back,” he said.
 
 Kanthapuram said according to Indian law, suicide and instigation to commit suicide, are crimes. Supreme Court had stated that attempt to commit suicide is a crime as no one has the right destroy life. “Even hurting a person with the intention to kill is also a crime. As per Indian law, withdrawing the life support system of a critically-ill patient amounts to a punishable crime,” he said.
 
 “Conditional or unconditional passive euthanasia is unacceptable and there are chances that people would misuse the   verdict. There have been many instances of patients, who have been suffering from untreatable medical condition, coming back to life. So, the order that hurts the sentiments of believers of different religions needs to be reviewed,’’ he said.
 
 Stating that human beings have the right to die with dignity, the SC had on Thursday allowed passive euthanasia, but made sure to set out strict guidelines that will govern when it is permitted.
 
 The top court also allowed an individual to draft a living will specifying that they not be put on life support if they slip into an incurable coma in the future.
