ERODE: Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) cadres on Friday hoisted black flags at their houses across the district, condemning the central government for not setting up the   (CMB) within the timeframe stipulated by the  .

 The apex court had on February 16 set a deadline of six weeks for the central government to constitute the CMB to regulate water release from Karnataka reservoirs, which ended on March 29.
 
 PMK leader and Dharmapuri MP   had earlier urged his party cadres and functionaries to hoist black flags at their houses, if the Centre failed to set up the CMB by the deadline set by the apex court.
 
 PMK state deputy general secretary V P Arumugam said the   water was the lifeline issue for 19 districts of Tamil Nadu. “We have been fighting for Cauvery water for the past 145 years. The Supreme Court had directed the central government to form Cauvery Management Board by March 29, but they have delayed it citing the assembly election in Karnataka,” he said.
 
 PMK cadres at Villarasampatty, Panangkadu, Periyasemur, Agraharam, Thanneerpanthalpalayam, Moolapalayam, Surampatty, Gobichettipalayam, Sathyamangalam, Perundurai, Bhavani, Arachalur and Modakkuruchi villages hoisted the black flags at their houses on Friday.
