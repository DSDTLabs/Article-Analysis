 This revelation comes at a time when the civic body in its annual budget has announced Rs 1 crore towards setting up a Marine Biodiversity Park, even as local endangered species such as the Pune Catfish suffer due to lack of conservation efforts.
 
 Speaking about the same, biologist   said, “The species was nominated as the Symbolic Nature Denizen Fish of Pune District after an online vote in February 2014. A resolution was passed to this effect by the general body of the PMC. Following this, a proposal was sent to the state government and wildlife board to identify it as the district fish.”
 
 The proposal is awaiting approval for the past 3 years, he added.
 
 Meanwhile, freshwater fish expert   said that the local fish species are suffering due to rapid development and inconsiderate dumping of waste into the city’s rivers. He also explained to TOI the problems and possible solutions to effectively protect this species, only found in the Pune region.
