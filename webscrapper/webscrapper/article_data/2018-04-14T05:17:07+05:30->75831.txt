MUMBAI: All 30 shops in one of Mumbai's busiest pedestrian subways of   ( ) have been issued notices for allowing hawkers to sit in front of the shops. 

 In a warning issued to shopkeepers, the   has stated shops with hawkers found sitting outside would be sealed.
 
 The BMC's A ward office issued the notices on April 12. A civic official said with the 18 CCTV cameras placed within the subway, they were able to monitor the entire area and found hawkers sitting outside these on a regular basis. "We observed that in most cases, the hawker was attached to the same store," said an official.
 
 The BMC's contention is the hawkers are unauthorised and, secondly, they use up pedestrian space. "Lakhs of commuters use the subway and with hawkers setting up shop outside, very little walking space is left," said assistant municipal commissioner of A ward Kiran Dighavkar.
