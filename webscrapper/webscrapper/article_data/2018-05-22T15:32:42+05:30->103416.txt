COIMBATORE: Class X students of Government Higher Secondary School in   along with their parents approached the district collector on Monday seeking his intervention to start accountancy group in English medium in their school.

 
 The students said that the school administration was not willing to start the commerce and accountancy group as they want to start only science groups aiming to produce doctors and engineers. The students said they were scared that science group would be tough and hence prefer commerce and accountancy.
 
 English medium was introduced in the school five years back and from this academic year it has obtained approval to start classes XI and XII.
 
 Till last year, students who wanted to continue their higher secondary education in English medium, had to travel more than 10km to schools either in   or  , said M  , parent of one of the students.
 
 But, not all the students could afford to travel for such a long distance daily, he said. Many students, who had scored minimal marks in their Class X examination, were sent to lathe or garment factories, without being able to send their children to the distant schools, he added.
 
 Sivaguru said, “As most of us are daily wage labourers, we could afford to enroll our students only in arts and science colleges. Keeping this in mind, our children also prefer to enroll in accountancy group as it would be helpful for them to pursue their higher education.”
 
 While district collector TN Hariharan assured his intervention and forwarded the petition to the chief educational officer (CEO), the officials at the office of CEO said that the groups, at the school, would be started based upon the interests of the students.
