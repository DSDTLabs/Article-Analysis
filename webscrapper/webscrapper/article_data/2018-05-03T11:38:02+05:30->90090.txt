Another mythology based television serial is about to hit the small screen. This time the show is based on Lord Shiva.

 The title of the soon-to-be-launched serial is, ‘Om Namah Shivay’. For the past few months there were speculations about the upcoming mythological serial to be based on Lord Shiva. But the makers were tight lipped about the project and the title. According to industry sources, after considering few names, the makers zeroed upon the title ‘Om Namah Shivay’.
 
  Mythology based fiction and period dramas which also touches upon religious beliefs, seem to be the current flavor on the small screen.
 
 On one hand we already have mythology based serials like ‘Manasa’, ‘Shani’ and ‘Mahakali’. While ‘Manasa’ is an original serial, both ‘Shani’ and ‘Mahakali’ are dubbed ones. However, not all of them are reportedly scoring well on TRP charts, as per close sources.
 
 Interestingly, another Bengali television channel has recently launched a serial named ‘Joi Baba Loknath’, which scored very well in the first two weeks. Notably, the serial has religious flavor too. 
 
 Amongst ongoing shows like ‘Jagat Janani Maa Sarada’, ‘Bhokter Duare Sri Krishna’, ‘Sree Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’ explore the same genre. ‘Jagat Janani Maa Sarada’, which is based on the lives of Sri Ramakrishna, Maa Sarada and Swami Vivekananda, is quite popular among the viewers.
