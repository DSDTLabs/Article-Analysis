MUMBAI: French  's concert here, which was initially scheduled for Friday, will now be held on Sunday, organisers confirmed saying they have received the nod from the authorities.

 In Bengaluru, Guetta was scheduled to headline a special gig on Thursday, kickstarting his four-city tour to Mumbai, Hyderabad and New Delhi.
 
 However, it was cancelled with organisers and authorities citing conflicting reasons.
 
 Guetta will keep his date with fans in Hyderabad tonight.
