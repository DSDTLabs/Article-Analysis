KOLKATA: A snag in a   aircraft delayed a   flight on Saturday morning for nearly eight hours and severely inconvenienced passengers.

 Flight SG-71 that was scheduled to take off at 6.45am, was first pushed back by an hour on Friday evening. On Saturday, the 78 passengers who arrived at the airport were in for an agonizing wait that stretched several hours as a snag was detected at the eleventh hour.
 
 Some passengers were to attend the International Bangla Sahitya Sammelan in   between January 13 and 15. They eventually missed the inauguration by   PM   as the flight took off at 2pm. Also held up were   joint registrar   and a couple of Ayurvedic researchers, who were on their way to present papers at Dhaka Universityâ€™s 18th congress.
 
 The airline apologized for the inconvenience and provided meals to the passengers. An aircraft was available only after a flight arrived from Silchar.
