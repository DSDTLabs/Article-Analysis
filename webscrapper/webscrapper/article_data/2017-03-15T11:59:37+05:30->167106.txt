 is back to the small screen with a brand new show Yeh Moh Moh Ke Dhaage, where he plays the   of a village in Gujarat.
 
  
 
  
 
  
  The character is matured, intelligent. witty and yet has a very interesting sense of humor. You will see Eijaz for the first time ever in a rustic avatar, dressed in traditional clothes, he looks very much the impressive village headman.
  
  The style statement is very much different from his usual contemporary look but what is similar to both the character and Eijaz is the love of a sister for her brother. In the show the character Mishri who is his sister is very worried for him and his marriage, she is the apple of his eye and hence can get away with anything.
  
  It is said that reel is inspired by fiction, and with Eijaz the story is very much the same. His younger sister who lives in Muscat is the one who has been insisting on him getting married and settling down.
  
  In fact she keeps sending him marriage proposals which she thinks would be perfect for him .They share a very close bond and she means the world to him. In fact her wish is his command and he never ever can refuse her for anything. It is not very often that reel is so close to fiction but in this case it sure is.
  
  Do not miss watching the show “Yeh Moh Moh Ke Dhaaghe “ From 21st March Monday to Friday at 7:00P.M only on   Entertainment Televison
