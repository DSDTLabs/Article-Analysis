KOLKATA: A 72-year-old woman was found dead—rigor mortis had already set in and she had developed gangrene on her legs—at her three-storey house near   at   on Wednesday.

 The deceased, identified as  , had been bed-ridden over the past twoand-a-half years. All her three sons are engineers. While the eldest one,   is an employee at   and lives separately in a nearby house, the two others lived with her. Police and neighbours claimed the two younger sons suffered from psychiatric disorders. The middle son went missing a week ago, cops said.
 
 “On Wednesday afternoon, the youngest brother walked up to Dibyendu’s house to inform him that their mother had passed away. Dibyendu then called up the Bansdroni police station. We reached the house to find the woman’s body in her room. Gangrene had developed on both her legs. There were several medical devices on her body, indicating that her health had to be monitored,” an investigating officer said. “But most importantly, rigor mortis had set in and neighbours complained of stench coming from the house. We are not sure when the woman had died. So, have sent the body for post-mortem.”
 
 The police said when they reached the house with the eldest son, only the youngest son was at home.
 
 According to the police, Vandana’s husband Sardendu had retired from a senior position at ONGC. “It was some years ago that Dibyendu forfeited his share of the ancestral house and asked his father to write a will in the name of his two brothers. He also decided that he would bear the expenditure of the entire family. Two years ago after Sardendu’s death,   too took to bed,” the investigating officer said. “Dibyendu usually tried to visit the house regularly to ensure everything was in place and also to make arrangements for food. Given the fact that he would visit the house frequently, we doubt she had died too long ago.”
 
 The police said they would register a case only after receiving the post-mortem report.
