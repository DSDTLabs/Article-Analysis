HYDERABAD: On Monday afternoon, all that an emotionally overwhelmed   could get himself to say was: “I am very disappointed.” A long pause followed, as if to suggest that the surreality of the judgment hadn’t sunk in for him just yet.

 Of the nine killed in the deadly 2007 blast, two were   members – his father  , and brother-in-law, Shafi-ur-Rehman. And despite the lapse of time, the bloodied images of the day haven’t still left the 29-year-old who was pushed to a corner and forced to rebuild his life from scratch, after that illfated day.
 
 “I had lost my mother at a much younger age. My father was the one elderly member in the family then. When he died in the blast, I suddenly found myself shouldering the responsibility of six younger siblings,” said the government employee in between battling myriad emotions -of rage, despair and piercing grief.
 
 Recollecting the sequence of events of May 18, from within his small room in  , he said: “I was inside the main hall while my father and brother-in-law were near the wuzukhana, when I suddenly heard a deafening sound. I stepped out to see bodies all round. I was numb for some time,” Khan said, wiping away his tears. He soon realised that among them, lay his people.
 
 “I was only 19 then, but I had to get over the loss quickly and be strong for the sake of my brothers and sisters. It was a very difficult time for us. Even now, we can’t stay at the Masjid for too long. We just go there, pray and come back. My sister gets worried when her children are late while returning from there,” he added.
 
 While time has taught Riyaz and his family to live with the  , during Friday prayers, they often get teary-eyed as memories of the dear ones come gushing back. Now, they only wish the dead were not denied justice.
