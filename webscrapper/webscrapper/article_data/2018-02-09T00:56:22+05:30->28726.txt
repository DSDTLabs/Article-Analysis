Vijayawada:   and enforcement sleuths conducted simultaneous raids on social welfare hostels in Krishna district on Thursday. As many as 10 hostels were raided by the vigilance sleuths after they received complaints about misappropriation of funds in the hostels.

 Five teams were formed with 15   from vigilance wing and as many from the revenue department. Social welfare girls’ hostels at Gannavaram, Nunna, Agiripalle and Nuzvid as well as boys’ hostels at Nandivada, Moturu, Avanigadda, Movva, Kanchikacherla and Gandepalli were raided.
 
 The vigilance officials have found serious discrepancies in attendance registers at all social welfare hostels. Vigilance DSP of Krishna district, R Vijay Paul, said, “We have found that physical strength of the students is way less than that shown in the registers. At Kanchikacherla, almost 50 per cent students shown in the register were not present.”
 
 Same is the case with other hostels. The number of students were less by 20 per cent to 40 per cent. The hostel wardens claimed that some students went home due to the the bandh and that a holiday was declared for schools.
 
 Vijay Paul said the police had seized all attendance registers and they would check with the schools whether the students were actually present or not.
 
 Another discrepancy the vigilance sleuths had noticed is related to stocks of commodities being provided to the students. The stock registers and the issuance registers were also seized from the hostels for verification. It was also noticed that some of the hostel wardens were not stay put on the premises which is a violation of rules.
 
 Vigilance sleuths have also summoned the assistant social welfare officers (ASWOs) who were responsible for conducting checks once in every month and maintain the records. “We will record their statements and submit a detailed report to the department,” Vijay Paul said.
