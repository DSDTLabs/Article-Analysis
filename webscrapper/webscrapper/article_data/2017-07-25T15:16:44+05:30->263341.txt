LUDHIANA: Three members of a family in New Subhash Nagar has been booked in a   death case for allegedly strangulating their daughter-in-law and hanging her body from the ceiling fan to make it look like a suicide. 

 The 21-year-old woman, Jyoti, got married to 25-year-old   on June 22, 2014.
 
 Her mother Shashi   alleged that soon after their marriage, the husband started torturing Jyoti for dowry. Initially, she used to share her ordeal with her parents. But she stopped telling them after her husband started abusing her for this too.
 
 Shashi Lata said, “On their demand, we gave Anil Rs 80,000 as he wanted to invest it in his business. However, they kept harassing her even after that following which she left the house last year and started living with us.Then, Anil and his family apologized to us and took her with them.” 
 
 All seemed to be fine after that and both the families even celebrated the couple’s third anniversary last month, said Shashi Lata. “However, just after this Anil demanded a plot from us. We started looking for some plots but were out of our budget.”
 
 On Saturday Shashi Lata got to know that Anil has withdrawn Rs 40,000 from Jyoti’s account that her mother had deposited for her. “When I called Anil to ask him about it, he said he would deposit the amount back to the account. Then, around 8.40pm Jyoti shared her pictures stating that they were going for an outing and around 9pm, she was found hanging from the ceiling fan. Her in-laws killed her for dowry,” alleged Shashi Lata.
 
 SHO at Jodhewal police station   said, it has been found out that the woman was strangulated and later her body was hanged from the ceiling fan by tying it with a dupatta.
 
 Police have registered a dowry death case against Anil, Jyoti’s brother-in-law Vinay Kumar and mother-in-law  , who are absconding.
