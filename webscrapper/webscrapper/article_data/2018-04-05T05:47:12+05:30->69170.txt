MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the   to issue a birth certificate to a   after keeping the space meant for the biological father’s name blank.

 The direction by a bench of Justices   and Riyaz Chagla came on a petition by an unwed mother who conceived the child through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). The 31-year-old’s petition said that her daughter was born in August 2016.
 
 The BMC claimed that she had signed the birth information form where the father’s name is mentioned and also his vocation and education. Her advocate, Uday Warunjikar, submitted an agreement between her and the IVF service provider which clearly mentioned that sperms were from an unknown donor. He said that although her signature was taken, she is not aware who filled the form.
 
  
 The judges noted that in her legal notice to the BMC the woman had not mentioned about the IVF procedure or even raise it originally in her petition. “Therefore, it is not possible for this writ court to record a finding that what is averred is correct,” they said.
 
 The bench referred to the March 13 judgment, in a similar case, where the court held that the power to correct or cancel an entry vesting with the registrar (births and deaths) is limited and which is to be exercised when the registrar is satisfied that such entry is erroneous in form or substance or has been fraudulently or improperly made.
 
 “The issue, whether it is written by somebody else, cannot be gone into by this court as it involves disputed question of facts,” the court said, adding that the woman’s remedy is to approach the civil court.
 
 Following the Supreme Court’s 2015 judgment, the judges directed that when a copy of the birth certificate is issued “the name of the father of the child shall not be incorporated and the same shall be kept blank.”
