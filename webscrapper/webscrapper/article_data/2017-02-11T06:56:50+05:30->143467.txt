KOLKATA:   minister   walked the tightrope on Friday , keeping the State Plan pegged at Rs 64,733 crore and leaving open a   of another Rs 28,390 crore, which is well within the   (FRBM) norms that allows the state to borrow Rs 30,000 crore.

 The only area of concern is the marginal increase in revenue deficit from Rs 9,095.06 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 9,469.27 in 2016-17. The additional borrowing will add to the debt stocks, totalling to Rs 3.66 lakh crore in 2017-18. Yet, Mitra has kept the fiscal deficit within limits though the state's own revenue is 40.66% of the total revenue.
 
 The projected rise in tax generation leaves the headroom for borrowing, which didn't happen during the Left regime.For that, Mitra has kept the hike in allocations for most key departments at a moderate 10%. With an eye on the 2018 panchayat polls, he, however, made exception for three departments, panchayat and ru ral development, water resources and health and family welfare. For expenditure control, he has marginally brought down the government subsidy from Rs 6,781.12 crore to Rs 5,794.85.
 
 The expenditure on salaries, pension and subsidy add up to Rs 60,960.49 crore. This, added to the state's loan repayment liability of Rs 45,339.98 crore, will come to Rs1,06,300.47 crore. And given the state's own revenue projection of Rs 55,786.74 crore and the share of central tax, duties and grants of Rs 84,636.73 crore, Mitra has about Rs 28,390 crore for Plan expenditure. The rest he has to borrow.
 
 He has thus set aside the 7th Pay Commission liability of anything between Rs17,000 crore--if he wants to match employees' DA with that of central staff--and Rs 35,000 crore, if he wants to hike their salary .
