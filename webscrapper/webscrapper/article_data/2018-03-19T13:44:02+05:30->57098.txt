Veteran actor   is currently busy with his political venture. The ‘Vishwaroopam’ star took the political plunge last month and floated his own political party  .

 While the actor is busy with his political commitments, a picture of Kamal Haasan sporting a big moustache has sent fans into a tizzy. Haasan’s new avatar gives us a major throwback to his ‘Thevar Magan’ days. In fact, speculations are rife that the picture might be Kamal Haasan’s new makeover for his forthcoming film ‘Indian 2’ with director Shankar. The mega-budget film is all set to take off at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad and is expected to be wrapped by the end of this year.
 
 ‘Indian 2’, a sequel to the 1996 vigilante thriller, is presently in its pre-production stage. The makers are finalising the cast and crew of the project. Actress   is being considered to play the leading lady in the much-awaited sequel. If reports are to be believed, ‘Indian 2’ may be Kamal Haasan’s last film before he enters full-time politics.
 
 Meanwhile, Kamal Haasan’s highly anticipated ‘Vishwaroopam 2’ has cleared the censor formalities and has been passed with a ‘U/A’ certificate. The trailer of the film will out after the ongoing strike between Tamil Film Producers’ Council and Digital Service Providers. ‘Vishwaroopam 2’ will release this summer.
