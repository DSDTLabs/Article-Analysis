RIHANA JATTAN (PHAGWARA): Reacting to the cancellation of over 5,000 permits of private buses, which has also hit the companies related to Badals and a few Akali leaders, Union food processing industries minister   has termed it "bad politics". 

 She blamed finance minister   and local government minister   for the step.
 
 "There are two persons, one who failed as finance minister (Manpreet Badal) in our government and other is who contested from BJP thrice (Sidhu), who are aiming only at Badals. But we are not bothered. We are capable of handling everything," 
 
 Harsimrat said, when journalists questioned her the new transport policy of Punjab. She was at Rihana Jattan village near Phagwara to lay foundation stone of a   approved by her ministry at the Centre.
 
 When asked if it reflected vendetta politics, she said, "It's bad politics. When I go to villages, people tell me that they aren't getting buses. First they (government) should send buses to the people."
 
 She also attacked the Congress government in Punjab for "increase in the number farmers' suicides". 
 
 "Even as suicides by farmers is a national phenomenon but the number of such cases in Punjab in the last 100 days is higher than ever seen in such a short time," she said. 
 
 "This has happened as the Congress promised moon to the farmers but later did not even give spoonful. This is now causing big disappointment among farmers," she told mediapersons. 
 
 "I remember that   had said the issue of loans would be between the new government and the banks but later what they did is peanuts. They aroused the hopes of the people which have now crashed," she said.
