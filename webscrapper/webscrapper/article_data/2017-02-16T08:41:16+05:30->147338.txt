MUMBAI: A   belonging to a Bollywood   was confiscated on Tuesday by the   that imposed a fine of Rs 29.56 lakh for evading road tax in Maharashtra. The actor’s vehicle is among the 451 high-end cars and SUVs   across the state—a record high —in the past one month of which 90% are from Mumbai region, officials said. The total tax evasion is over Rs 10 crore. 

 “Most of the vehicles confiscated for tax evasion in Mumbai are high-end including Porsche, Range Rover, Audi and Mercedes around Rs 40 lakh to over Rs 1 crore,” said a senior official from transport commissioner’s office. “The owners had purchased the vehicle in another state or union territory to avoid paying road tax, which was high in Maharashtra. Most of the vehicles were found with   plates of Daman and Diu, Pondicherry and Jharkhand, where the tax is very low. The vehicle owners were penalized and told to pay the tax along with a hefty interest. ”
 
 The actor’s SUV was registered in Sikkim, where the taxation for vehicle is very low, said an official. The Andheri RTO released his vehicle after the fine—Rs 24.23 lakh tax and Rs 5.33 lakh interest—was paid.
 
 “We found that car owners paid tax up to 5% of the vehicle cost when the actual tax in Maharashtra would be 20%. For example, a vehicle which costs you Rs 50 lakh will attract a road tax of Rs 10 lakh in Maharashtra, but if you register it in another state like Jharkhand, it will come to as low as Rs 2-2.5 lakh,” said deputy transport commissioner Pradeep Shinde.
 
 Following the directives of transport commissioner Praveen Gedam issued on January 18, the RTOs started cracking down on vehicle owners who evade tax. “Citizens are requested to tip us off about any such vehicle on city roads or parked in the neighbourhood,” Shinde said.
 
 Regional transport officer (Andheri) Govind Saindane said, “If the car owner has paid the local tax, he will not be harassed. Our drive is only against those who have evaded road tax.”
