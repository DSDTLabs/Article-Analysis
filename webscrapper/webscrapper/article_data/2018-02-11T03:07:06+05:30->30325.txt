NEW DELHI: A gang of four   men fled with three motorcycles, mobile phones, laptop, ATM cards and cash from commuters after stopping them near   Flyway. The three incidents happened in a span of 30 minutes on Wednesday night. The cases were registered on Thursday. 

 TOI had earlier reported about how two men returning from south Delhi were stopped and robbed of their motorcycles, laptop, mobile phone and cash. The complainant, Sambit Patnaik, told police that two men came from behind him as he was going towards   and pulled out his motorcycle’s keys around 10.50pm on Wednesday night.
 
 The two men on a Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle with registration number DL 5SBZ 2619 came behind Patnaik and pulled out a pistol. They told him to hand over his motorcycle and all other valuable items. Patnaik’s friend, Sanit Khosla, was behind them and stopped at the spot when he witnessed the commotion. As Khosla walked towards them, two more men on another motorcycle came and held Khosla. They then looted the two men and fled with their motorcycles, leaving their own vehicles at the spot. 
 
 Another incident was reported at Khelgaon flyover around 10.45pm. The complainant, Tarun Kumar, was robbed of his two mobile phones, cash and ATM cards by the accused.
 
 “I was going towards   when men on a Bajaj Pulsar and a Yamaha FZ came and stopped me. One of the accused then took out a pistol and snatched my motorcycle’s keys. They took away my two mobile phones, ATM cards, cash and other valuable items,” said Kumar. He had a duplicate key with him, which he used to drive ahead and inform the police.
 
 Police officers said they were already on the lookout for the accused as another complainant, Alok Kumar Puri, had informed them that he was also robbed in a similar manner around 10.30pm.
 
 A preliminary probe revealed that all the accused are in their late 20s. Cases have been registered against the men. DCP (east) Omvir Singh was unavailable for comment.
