The director,  , reveals that most of the locations of the shoot were in   itself, while some were in Augusta, Georgia. “We found some really shady locations in Detroit, where most of the residents are African Americans or Latinos. Some were so rundown that we had to clean up the sites before starting shoot,” he says.

 And did they encounter any real gangsters? “To be honest, no. Everything went smooth and we had fun shooting there. But we were particular that the movie shows the dark side of Detroit, not just the posh one,” he says, adding, ‘’One of the camera persons was from Detroit and so we knew exactly where to go.” 
 
 The film is a fictionalised take on certain real life incidents in the city, which, Nirmal says, was the embodiment of the American dream in its heydeys. “Top manufacturers started out from Detroit and it was the pride of America before the companies shut down and riots occurresd. The city took a beating and slowly crumbled. But it also has an element of survival in it, the city is not giving up and has soul still. It’s a city looking for a second chance in life. All the characters in the movie are also looking for second chances. Detroit is trying to redefine itself, so are the characters in the film.”
 
 The focus of the film, though, is on the immigrant Indian community in Detroit, and so Tamil and Malayalam will be the language of the film.
 So, it   a gangster in it? “He is part of that world but a realistic kind of character. Everything, including the stunts is realistic.” And Nirmal is all praise of the actor, who, he says, has delivered a nuanced performance. “He is a man of few words, and most of it is conveyed through body language. He knew exactly what to do and had a lot of inputs for the movie.”
 Ask him it it’s a thriller and he says, “I’d rather say it’s a serious, realistic crime drama.”
