BHOPAL: The foot-in-mouth   education minister Vijay Shah was at it again. Shah asked the madarsas in the state to hoist the tricolor daily and sing national anthem in a bid to inculcate patriotism among the students.

 Shah’s statement came in Bhopal at the 20th foundation day of MP state  , just a week after he directed government school students to respond to roll calls in classrooms with ‘Jai Hind’. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was also present at the event.
 
 “Since the rule is mandatory for government schools, I want madrasas to follow it without any discrimination. This is a matter of respect and dignity of the nation,” Shah said.
 
 He added that such a practice would inculcate patriotism among madarsa students. “If we do not inculcate patriotism among them, then we are doing injustice to society and to this nation,” he said.
 
 The minister further said that besides religious education, students in madarsas must be imparted primary education. Shah said that a plan to introduce computer education in madrasas was underway.
 
 He emphasised on the importance of modern education among students in madrasas and said that the state government would soon fulfil the demands put forward by the Madarsa Board, which include increase in grants and setting up of an auditorium in city in Dr APJ Abdul Kalam’s memory. He urged CM Chouhan to double the grant given to madrasas.
 
 Addressing the event, Madarsa Board chairman   said that madrasas across the state were already working towards the “best interest of the country”.
 
 “Our madrasas took part in the Trilanga rally and participated in Independence Day with great fervour. Madrasas are no different from mainstream schools. We do everything in the interest of the nation and contribute to social causes,” he added.
