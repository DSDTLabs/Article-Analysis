PUNE: A 33-year-old car passenger was killed and two others, including the driver, were injured when the four-wheeler crashed into a road-side railing following an attempt to overtake a heavy vehicle from the wrong side at   on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass early on Saturday morning. 

 A steel rod from the railing pierced through the car’s bonnet and dash board before cutting the throat of   of Wakad, who was occupying the rear seat, Hinjewadi police said. 
 
 Doubey’s friends, Sandep P Rajeev Nair (33) of Marunji and   (31), who was sitting next to driver’s seat, escaped with injuries on their faces, chests and hands. The police said Nair was driving the car. 
 
 Assistant inspector Anand   said the accident occurred around 6am at Punawale, when the three friends were travelling in the car on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. “The car was at high speed. When they reached near a weighing bridge at Punawale, Nair tried to overtake a truck from the left,” he said.
 
 In that attempt, Nair lost control of the wheel and the car crashed into the railings of the bypass. The impact of the accident was such that one of the still girders of the railings pierced through the car’s bonnet and dash board. It broke the rear glass of the car and cut Doubey’s throat. “He died on the spot,” Pagare said.
 
 Nair sustained injuries on his face and shoulder, while Patro sustained injuries on his chest, face and right hand. “They are undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital,” Pagare said.
 
 Doubey, Nair and Patro were working with a city-based private company. The police have registered an offence against Nair under sections 279 (rash driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 304-A (causing death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Motor Vehicle Act.
