  "The government pass is valid only for 30 km, but the distance between Mahalithotti and Sathyamangalam via   is 54km. So we have to shell out Rs40 every day," said A Sangeetha, a BCom student of the   in Sathyamangalam.
 
  The students have appealed to the state government to issue ‘free pass’ from Mahalithotti to Sathyamangalam.
