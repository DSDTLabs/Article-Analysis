LUCKNOW: Officers of the Moradabad forest division have been put in the dock by the   (CWC) for allegedly luring a   by using blood of a boy mauled by the big cat.

 According to residents of Bahadurnagar village, to which the boy belonged, a forest ranger allegedly used a rag to wipe blood off the boy’s wounds and kept it in the cage to lure the big cat in. The scent of the 13-year-old boy’s blood was supposed to have lured the big cat into the trap.
 
 Taking note of the allegations, the CWC issued summons to the ranger and the divisional forest officer. It also sought a report from the ranger by Monday.
 
 However, forest officers denied the allegations. Moradabad conservator RP Verma said, “We came to know about it through newspaper reports. Soil from the spot where the boy was mauled was kept in the cage and not a blood-soaked rag.” He also denied receiving any summons.
 
 Meanwhile, Moradabad DFO Kanhaiya Patel said, “The committee probably took note of newspaper reports. I will seek an explanation from the ranger though I have not received any summons from the committee so far.”
