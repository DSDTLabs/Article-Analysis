CHANDIGARH: Reacting to the chargesheet submitted by the CBI against former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Haryana Congress spokesperson Ran Singh Man said the charges against Hooda were baseless and politically motivated as the ruling   was afraid of his stature in state politics and popularity with masses.

 “Even the complainants in this case, on whose petition the CBI probe was ordered, did not have clean hands and were used as a tool by the government to take political revenge against Hooda. The case would fall flat during the trial,” Man added.
 
 Senior INLD leader and Hisar MP   said, “It’s better late than never.” Chautala added the BJP government should not have waited for four years to take action against Hooda, when it was fully aware about the land scams by the Hooda government. He, however, alleged that the Khattar government had saved some senior officers and the INLD would soon reveal their names for their involvement in this scam.
 
 Naveen Jaihind, in charge of  , claimed that in 2012, his party leader and Delhi CM   had exposed the land scams by the then Hooda government during his 10-year regime. “Unfortunately, the BJP has failed to take any action against many of such scams, including the one involving Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law  . The present chargesheet against Hooda seems to be a political stunt of the ruling party. The BJP government has deliberately submitted a chargesheet after four years. We are sure that soon Hooda would join the BJP and the government would weaken this case,”   claimed.
 
 Haryana BJP spokesperson Raman Malik said Hooda should clarify as to whether it was his own business or he was only a conduit or agent of some other group or individual. “Hooda would now pay for the wrongs he had committed during his tenure as state CM,” Malik added.
