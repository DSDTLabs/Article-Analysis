ISLAMABAD: A day after the   at the Hague stayed the death sentence awarded to   by a Pakistani military court, Prime Minister   chaired a high-level meeting with   chief,  , and ISI head Gen Naveed Mukhtar, among others, to discuss the fall-out of the issue that’s fast gaining international ramifications.

 While Pakistan’s foreign ministry said that it would examine India’s petition at the Hague before responding, defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif termed the move by New Delhi as an attempt to divert attention from its “state-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan.
 
 Sharif’s adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz said Islamabad was reviewing the move by New Delhi to approach the ICJ on Jadhav case and a decision in this regard will be made soon.
 
 “We are analysing the Indian petition and the International Court of Justice’s jurisdiction in the case,” Aziz said. “The Foreign Office will issue a statement about any decision taken in this regard in a couple of days,” he added.
 
 But Khawaja took to twitter to state that the alleged Indian spy was convicted for offences against Pakistan’s national security. Others present for the meeting were finance minister Ishaq Dar and interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
 
 Jadhav, according to Pakistani authorities, was arrested on March 3, 2016, through a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan’s Mashkel area on espionage charges.
 
 India states that he was kidnapped from Iran where he was on business after retiring from the Indian Navy, and said they learnt of his arrest through a press release nearly three weeks later.
 
 Jadhav was tried for espionage and terrorist activities by a secret military court and awarded the death sentence in April this year. India termed the death sentence “an act of premeditated murder” and promised to save him. Islamabad had turned down multiple times New Delhi’s requests for consular access to Jadhav.
