NEW DELHI: AC makers are sweating it out as freak weather conditions and frequent thunderstorms across several states have kept searing temperatures at bay, leading to lower footfall at showrooms and sluggish sales.

 
 Demand in March-May — peak season for AC sales — has remained weak. According to industry officials, sales are 10-15% lower than last year and a revival looks tough, considering monsoon is set to arrive before time .
 
 The uncharacteristic weather has made the situation tough, said Rahul Tayal, director (strategic business and marketing) at LG India. “Industry volumes have been impacted. The heat wave is missing in north India and in parts of south India.”
 
 Gaurav Sah, business head for ACs at  , said, “A weak summer has been the primary reason for low offtake in AC market. Pre-season stocking due to change in energy efficiency rating further impacted the inventory.” He, however, added that Panasonic has registered growth in value terms.
 
 Around 55 lakh ACs were sold in India in 2017, which was 18% higher than 2016. An industry executive said, “AC companies get nearly 60% of sales during this time, which is usually a bumper period.”
 
 States such as Delhi,   and   have seen frequent bouts of thunderstorms and light rains.
 
 Another executive said, “There has not been a continuous summer because of frequent thunderstorms and other weather phenomenon. States such as  , Delhi-NCR region, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan are impacted. In south, there have been intermittent rains in   and Kerala. This is not good for sales.”
 
 Voltas, which leads the AC market, said companies are shifting focus to other regions that are not touched by adverse weather conditions. “Brands having an extensive national footprint are focusing on markets like central and western India, where the heat now seems to be picking up,” a spokesperson at the Tata-group company said. The slow offtake has triggered discounts, offers and freebies.
