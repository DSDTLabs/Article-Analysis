NEW DELHI: On the back of allegations of corrupt land deals by   chief Lalu Prasad’s daughter and   MP Misha Bharti,   on Friday urged the   to act against her, saying she had not disclosed her assets in the election affidavit.

 The party on Friday said the family had not learnt any lesson from the conviction of Lalu, who was found guilty of swindling public money in the infamous fodder scam.
 
 “It is a matter of great agony and distress that Lalu, who used to talk about social justice, was held guilty of swindling public money but the family has not learnt any lesson,” senior BJP leader   said, adding that Lalu was running a party of loot as latest evidence showed the family having bought properties worth crores for a pittance.
 
 Misha Bharti, Lalu’s eldest daughter, and her spouse   are alleged to have acquired a farmhouse at Bijwasan, near IGI airport, where many rich and influential people own properties, for just Rs 1.41 crore. The couple also acquired a farmhouse at   after an intriguing transaction with the owner.
 
 Prasad urged the   to issue notice to Misha for misrepresentation of facts in her affidavit for the Rajya Sabha polls as she had not mentioned the properties. “The Centre will take appropriate action against the shady land deals,” Prasad said.
