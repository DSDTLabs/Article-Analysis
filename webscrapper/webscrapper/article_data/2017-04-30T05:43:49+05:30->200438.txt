CHENNAI: The   Teacher Eligibility Test (TNTET) 2017 conducted after a hiatus of four years, was taken by 2.3 lakh applicants across the state on Saturday. On the first day of the examination, the state   conducted the TET paper I exam that will filter teachers for classes I through V across state schools. The paper II exam which recruits teachers for classes VI to VIII is slated to be held on Sunday.

 In Chennai alone, nearly 95% of the applicants (9,654) took the paper I exam from 27 centres. Paper 2 will see a whopping 5.5 lakh applicants taking the test from 2,000 centres across the state. Around 31,000 applicants will take the test from 88 centres in Chennai. 
 
 “Special arrangements have been made to ensure that there is no malpractice. Nearly 40,000 teachers are involved in different roles such as invigilators, supervisors, department officials and custodian points officers,” said an   official. 
 
 TET was frozen in 2013 after being conducted only for two years. But in March 2017, the school education department officially made TET mandatory and ordered all teachers recruited after November 2011 to take it to continue in their posts. 
 
 “Due to the gap, this year the number of candidates writing the test is large,” added the official.
