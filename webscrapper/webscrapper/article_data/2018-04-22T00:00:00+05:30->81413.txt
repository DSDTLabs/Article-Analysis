Age is just a number; it doesn’t affect the fire I have within me. I was 17, when I became a part of the Indian women’s cricket team and had to play with more experienced girls. 
I started playing cricket when I was 5. Mostly, I picked up the game by watching my elder brother, Shravan. When I was 12, my father got a private coach to train me. Being a girl and playing cricket never bothered me. I had a knack for the game from the start. I saw my brother and father play. At the age of 15, I scored a double century for the Maharashtra under-19 team in a West Zone one-day tournament – that was my breakthrough moment. I am the second Indian after all-rounder Harmanpreet Kaur, to sign up for the Women’s Big Bash League in Australia. Cricket has changed my life – it changed the way I view life. 
 
 
 See the positive in every situation. I believe in equanimity. I don’t get too excited about either success or failure. 
 
 
 
 To win the World Cup. My inner motivation that keeps me going from one game to the next is to do something for my parents, who have always motivated me. I really want to make them proud. 
 
 
 
 Every day is a challenge but I never get intimidated. You have to overcome your fear of the unknown to be a winner.
