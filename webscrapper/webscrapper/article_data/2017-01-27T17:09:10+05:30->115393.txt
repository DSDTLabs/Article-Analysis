Dileep's upcoming movie   will once again have him tickling your funny bone as the actor would play an indolent youth who is comfortable lazing around, much to the chagrin of his well-respected dad.

  The film's director Biju Arookkutty, who had previously helmed Doctor Love, tells us, ' 's character George Vadakkan is the son of a pastor, played by Renji Panicker. George's dad wanted him to also follow the divine path and become a priest. But he not only shuns priesthood but becomes a wayward youth.'
 
 The filmmaker says that the movie is not a slapstick comedy but has a lot of situational humour, which reflects the 'ideological tussle' between the current youth and their parents. The movie was entirely shot in Thrissur and the team had also roped in actors based in the district such as Jayaraj Warrier and Sunil Sugatha for pivotal roles. 'We wanted to capture the essence of Thrissur city and its people,' the director adds.
 
  Georgettan's Pooram has Rajisha Vijayan playing Dileep's love interest in the movie. 'She had a very grounded character in her debut movie Anuraga Karikkin Vellam, so we were not sure how she would fit in to the role of Merlin in this film as she needed to be a bit glamourous and over the top. But she stunned us with the way she carried off the role,' says Biju, adding that Rajisha plays the daughter of a Pranchiyettan-like, wealthy father in the movie.
 
  Ask the director if he worries about the backlash of Dileep-Kavya wedding adversely affecting the film and he says, 'We had a six-day outdoor schedule after the wedding and one thing I particularly observed was that there was no change in how people including the fans had approached Dileep and his work.
