HYDERABAD: "No helmet I die like real men." This "daring and dashing" message found right below the number plate (AP11 P5905) of a bike was enough to send Hyderabad police to send a light-hearted stinker to the motorist. In a tweet, the police (#HYDTPweCareForU) gently reminded him, "We r extremely sorry Mr   sir. We won't let U die. We will see that U "LIVE LKE REAL MEN." Please wear helmet and ride. They also tagged the additional commissioner of police (traffic) @AddlCPTrHyd in the tweet. 

 
  
 "The owner of the bike has a total of 10 challans pending against him. Seven challans are for violating helmet rule. We are trying a humorous and funny approach to warn people who are found violating the traffic rules to grab their attention. People are more responsive when police are friendly and funny," reasoned  , additional CP (traffic).
 
 While police pointed at citizens violating rules, many   users used commented with pictures of traffic cops driving without helmets. The administrators of the official Hyderabad traffic police FB page also replied along with pictures of the dashing bike and challans, saying: "Hyderabad traffic police care for you (bikers). You should wear a helmet and ride."
