Mumbai: The BEST administration, which is keen on procuring 50 AC minibuses on  , plans to come up with a fresh proposal—it will pay only lease rent and there will be ‘zero’ cost for employing staff and paying for fuel, insurance and maintenance of the buses.

 “If we take a bus on wet lease, we have to pay the lease rent, besides spending on   and employing a conductor,” said a senior official. “The lease rent in this case comes to Rs 30/km. But there is a fresh proposal where we will have to pay Rs 10/km extra (a total Rs 40/km) to the private contractor, who will also be responsible for paying for fuel.”
 
 The proposal has been drafted and is likely to be circulated among committee members for clearance. Once cleared, the BEST can opt for the Rs 40/km lease rent to hire minibuses, that can ply 200 km daily. “We are saving Rs 200 crore by scrapping the 266 AC Cerita buses. By entering into a wet lease agreement for procuring minibuses, we will save another Rs 25 crore (towards capital cost of purchasing new buses). This is apart from the zero maintenance and no costs on fuel,” said an official.
