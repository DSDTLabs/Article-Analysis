KOCHI:   adorned the floor of her artist space at   with what appeared to be 'kolam' patterns while the room was reverberating with musical notes played in sync with her brush strokes.

 The live-sound performance was the first time Durvasula, a sculptor and a participating artist at the   (KMB) 2016, tried her hand at the three-dimensional graphic painting. The UK based artist had never practised with the musical accompanists either.
 
 “Though I have painted in two dimensions on paper and canvas, it is my maiden 3-D artwork. Though the medium was new to me, I thought performing live without any prior practice would lend a more organic feel to the event. It was trial and error,“ she said.
 
 A cow-dung carpet was used over a section of the floor for the artwork.
 
 Durvasula and her assistant Deepak Johny, a KMB 2016 volunteer, first put down large dots on the carpet using paint brushes dipped in rice batter. She then drew curved lines to connect the dots in shapes that were inspired by, but were not, traditional `kolam' designs.
