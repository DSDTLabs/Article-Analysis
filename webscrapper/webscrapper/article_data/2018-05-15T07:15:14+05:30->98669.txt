NEW DELHI: The race to take over   (FHL) is hotting up.   has revised its offer, making it more attractive despite the FHL board deciding in favour of bid from Munjal and Burman families.

 
 The Manipal Hospitals and TPG combine, in its revised offer on Monday, increased the price for preferential allotment of shares to Rs 180 per share from Rs 160 per share, offering to make an investment of Rs 2,100 crore. It is learnt that another bidder, IHH of Malaysia is also likely to give a revised offer. A merchant banker said that if the revised offers of these bidders are better than the Munjal-Burman Families' offer, the chances of it getting rejected in the EGM seem possible.
 
 Once the board's proposal is defeated in the EGM, it will have to find another better offer to get it accepted by the shareholders.
 
 The consortium has also increased the valuation of FHL to Rs 9,403 crore from earlier one of Rs 8,358 crore offered in May 6 revised offer for its merger with Manipal Hospital. A value of Rs 9,403 crore for FHL will translate into a per share value of Rs 180 per share as against the valuation of Rs160 per share offered in the earlier proposal on May 6.
 
 However, the board has already accepted the offer given jointly by families of   of Hero Enterprise and   of  . Munjal and Burman had offered to invest Rs 800 crore through a preferential allotment of equity shares at Rs167 per share and Rs 1000 crore through a preferential issue of warrants at Rs 176 per share or as per Sebi guidelines, whichever is higher.
 
 The offer will be put to vote at the EGM of FHL over the next one month. In a letter to the board of FHL, Manipal Hospital said that Munjal and Burman famililies' offer 'only partially solved the short-term liquidity concerns of FHL and fails to deliver any long term benefits to FHL. Therefore, procuring the approval of 75% of the FHL shareholders for the Hero and Burman Offer is likely to be very challenging for the board.'
