MUBARAKPUR: The bahu of Yadav parivar, whose   is seeking a bid to retain power in UP, on Thursday rode on father-in-law Mulayam Singh’s popularity to seek votes for her husband from the crucial  .

 Mulayam is an MP from Azamgarh. He had also contested from Mainpuri in 2014 but later gave up that seat for Azamgarh. During this election, Mulayam did not make any public appearance in Azamgarh which gave 9 out of 10 seats to SP in 2012.
 
 On Thursday, Dimple held four back to back rallies with her oratory largely in Azamgariya dialect that raised eyebrows and drew applause.
 
 “Hum Azamgarh mai pehli baari aayee hayee. Humai aap logon ka aashirwad chaiee. Akhilesh bhaiya ko mukhya mantri banane ki zimedaari aap logon ko baaye,” she told the gathering.
 
 “The land of Azamgarh has always backed Samajwadis. While you all gave honour to Netaji (Mulayam), you also gave support to Akhilesh bhaiya. Now, I am sure that you would stand behind me and help us win. Only then we can cross the 300 target,” she added.
 
 The Kannauj MP launched direct attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his comments on graveyards and cremation grounds.
 
 “Look at the level which these BJP people and pradhan mantri have taken to. Is this how you the elections are won with such unparliamentary language?” she said.
 
 “In last three years, Modiji has been taking about mann ki baat but never mentioned any kaam ki baat. We did facelift exercises in most cities and established big ticket infra projects in sports, business centres and created employment opportunities with laptop distribution,” she said
 
 “Jaise kintoo aaj aakhri din tha..unki taraf se aapko nivedan karein...tabhi aapke Akhilesh bhaiya..Azamgarh ki paavan dharti ne hamesha Samajwadiya ko saath diya hai. Jahan Netaji samaan badane ka kaam kiya hai, wahi Akhilesh bhaiya ka bhi samaan badaya hai.. aur ab mujhe bharosa hai aap sab mera bhi samaan badane ka kaam karenge,” she concluded.
