  The governor also visited the Parasnath-based 'Bhomiya baba' and other famous Jain temples. 
 
  While interacting with KGBV students, Murmu expressed her dissatisfaction over the quality of education being provided in the school. 
 
  The governor also visited the Madhuban-based CRPF camp. 
 
  Popularly known as Sarhul among the Santhals across Santhal Pargana and North Chhotanagpur region, Baha festival is mainly celebrated to worship the new flowers of Saal and Mahua trees ahead of the Spring festival. During the three-day festival, villagers collect flowers and offer them to the deities.
