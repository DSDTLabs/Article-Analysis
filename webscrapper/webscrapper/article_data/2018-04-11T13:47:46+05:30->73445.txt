COIMBATORE: An hour and half exam session, which the children usually dread, turned out to be a fun on Tuesday for a bunch of students from select government schools in   block here. 

 Instead of the conventional paper and pencil format, the students answered the questions in tablets. With most of the questions bearing a pictorial representation rather than the usual texts, the examination was an engaging activity for the students in Classes between I and III.

 “One tablet will be assigned for five students each in these 10 schools," said assistant project officer of  . “Each student will finish the set of questions and the marks would be noted down. Then the tablet will be passed to the next student,” said a teacher, under the condition of anonymity.
 
 The teacher said the students were made to take questions only for 20 marks on tablets while for 40 marks they were asked to answer in paper. Forty more marks is for project work, which was also completed using tablets. With most of the questions on tablet bearing pictorial representations, the students either had to swipe or click to give answers. “The students had completed their examination much earlier than the given time,” the teacher said.
 
 “As soon as a student clicks on submit button, marks would appear, just like in games,” the teacher said. , The teachers take note of the marks and synchronise with the centralised system. According to the parents, their wards have started showing interest to go to school on regular basis . “This method would be implemented in all elementary schools across the state from the next academic year,” said Bell Raj.
