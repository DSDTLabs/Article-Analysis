NAVI MUMBAI/MUMBAI: Two minor students, a girl and a boy, have been booked by the Vashi police for forging a HSC hall ticket to enable the accused girl to appear for the exam on Wednesday.

 The Vashi police have registered an FIR against the girl as the key accused and the boy as co-accused. 
 
  
  
 
 “They have been booked under Section 465 (punishment for forgery), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code along with   Prevention of Malpractices at University, Board and Other Specified Examinations Act, 1982,” said Nitin Gite, inspector from the Vashi police station. “The forgery came to light when both went to the exam centre at Father Agnel Junior College in Vashi on Tuesday to appear for the English exam of the commerce stream,” said Ajay Landge, senior inspector of the Vashi police station. As both the hall tickets had the same details except for their names and photos it was difficult to identify the forged document. Both were allowed to appear for the exam and then an inquiry was conducted.
 
 “The girl resides in Tilak Nagar with her maternal uncle, while the boy resides in Sanpada. The boy is a student of Tilak College in Vashi, while the girl also claimed to be a student of the same college. The girl was probably not going to college after her SSC, which she had appeared privately. When the HSC board exams were declared and her mother asked about her hall ticket, she decided to forge her friend’s hall ticket,” Gite added. On Thursday, six students arrived late for the Hindi exam. The board officials in Mumbai allowed only five of the students to appear for the exam as they had reported to the centre before 11.20am. “The numbers are drastically down compared to day one,” said Subhash Borse, in-charge secretary of the Mumbai division board.
