GAYA: Contrary to expectations, it did not turn out to be NDA versus NDA in the legislative council election for Gaya (Teachers’) constituency as LJP candidate D N Sinha came a poor third. It was Hriday Narain Singh of the Congress who finished as the runner up. The seat has been won by sitting MLC and RLSP candidate Sanjiv Shyam Singh.   Sanjiv got 5,674 of the 11,000 plus votes against the 1,683 votes garnered by Sinha. Congress candidate Hriday Narain Singh got 1,953 votes. The result was declared on Wednesday night.    RLSP state vice-president Sarfaraz Khan said all other NDA partners, including BJP, supported the RLSP candidate. Khan claimed that his party candidate, despite the NDA tag, got overwhelming support from the teachers of minority educational institutions.    From day one LJP candidate D N Sinha, professor of English, Patna University, got a short shrift from other NDA functionaries. To express solidarity with the RLSP candidate, senior BJP functionaries, including former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, was present in Gaya during filing of nomination papers by the RLSP candidate.    Poll watchers feel that by fielding a tainted candidate against Sanjiv, RJD offered a cake walk to the RLSP candidate. RJD fielded Dinesh Prasad Yadav, who had hit the headlines a few years back for allegedly molesting a folk singer at a Bodh Gaya hotel. He was subsequently charge sheeted by the Gaya police. With just 1,197 votes, Dinesh ended fifth.    Meanwhile, several JD (U) supporters voted for the RLSP candidate, thereby making things easy for him. Asked why the party did not explicitly support the RJD candidate, JD (U) member Lalji Prasad said both UPA partners – RJD and Congress – were in the fray for the seat and it would have been imprudent on the part of JD (U) to support RJD at the cost of Congress.
