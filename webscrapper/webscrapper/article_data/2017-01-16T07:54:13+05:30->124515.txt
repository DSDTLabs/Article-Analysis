JAIPUR: Despite several reminders, internal complaint committees against   have not been constituted in   at several places.

 In Jodhpur recently, a matter related to a complaint filed by a woman came to light. But there was no   in place to look into her complaint. “We sent state-level internal complaint committee from Jaipur to hear her grievance,”   said.
 
 When it came to the notice of health directorate, it pulled up the officials of respective districts, where committees have not been formed. Health directorate set a deadline of three days to form the committees.
 
 “It has come to our notice that till date, there are several offices which have not formed such committees. It is clear violation of directions of health department,” Dr Meena mentioned in a letter to all senior officials in all the districts.
 
 He said that there was internal complaint committee at divisional, district and block level offices of health department. But due to transfers of doctors, the reconstitution of committees is required. In Jodhpur too, it required reconstitution of the committee.
 
 Health directorate had issued directions on January 10 to ensure that there should be a committee in place to hear the complaints of women employees.
 
 Around three years ago, women empowerment directorate had issued guidelines for forming committees. The committees have to be constituted at division, district and block levels. Officials said that at most of the places, internal complaint committee had been formed but now as doctors had been transferred at various places the committees are not in effect at some places. “We are ensuring that at every office there should be an internal complaint committee by setting a deadline of three days.
 
 The women directorate had issued the notification on forming committees three years ago. It has clearly mentioned that the department which has its offices at block level, should also have such committees at block levels too.
