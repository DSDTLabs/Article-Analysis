In order to overcome the depression, Shrikant’s Mama (Gajanan Kasarwar) suggests him to marry. Soon, Shrikant marries Swamini (Amruta Dudhe), however, he is not able to forget Samidha.

However, he loved her and despite many obstacles they decided to marry. But as their relationship progressed, he was not able to get over his partner’s past. Days before they were to get married, Shrikant accused Samidha of infidilety, which led to their break-up.
