CHANDIGARH: To make the existing land acts more relevant to the changing land usage, the   government on Tuesday notified a six-member revenue commission.

 Justice S S Saron (retd) of the Punjab and   high court, who retired in September last, will head the commission that would also review the existing policies with regard to disposal and utilization of government lands.
 
  
  
 
 
 The commission will examine the need for new acts or the amendment in the existing ones to legalize the land lease practices in order to provide a firm basis for a modern high value agriculture and horticulture in place of current monoculture of wheat-paddy.
 
 The commission will be tasked with streamlining the existing laws, procedures and processes relating to land administration in line with the requirements of modern agricultural and non-agricultural uses. It will propose new laws and procedures, along with other methods, to make revenue administration more transparent and responsive to the needs of the people.
 
 With a term of one-year, the commission would submit its report on the issues referred to it from time to time. It would have the mandate to review the organizational structure of revenue-related aspirations, expectations, needs and requirements of the contemporary Punjabi society. It will suggest norms of population and area for all administrative units such as division, district, sub-division, tehsil and sub-tehsil.
 
 Giving details, an official spokesperson of the state government said the commission would have Punjab RERA chairman N S Kang; former head of economics department,  , Patiala, S S Gill; ex-PCS officer Jaswant Singh; and former MD of state cooperative bank  , as its other members. The   (PLRS) advisor N S Sangha will be its member secretary. However, it was not yet clear if the commission would take a relook at the punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), which is applicable in   areas of the state.
