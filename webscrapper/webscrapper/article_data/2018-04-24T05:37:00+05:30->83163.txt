Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is set to start demolition of 157 shops on   in Mahal for widening the 1.5km road patch.

 Additional municipal commissioner Ravindra Kumbhare said the civic body will start razing the structures from April 24.
 
 NMC is widening the existing 15m road passing from Central Avenue, Badkas Chowk, Kotwali Police Station Chowk to CP and Berar Chowk, to 24 metres. According to a survey carried out by NMC, around 1455.82 sq m land will be required for widening the road patch.
 
 “All hurdles in widening of Kelibagh Road were cleared after the Supreme Court recently rejected three special leave petitions filed by the shopkeepers,” he said.
 
 The petitioners had challenged Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s orders of October 18, 2016, rejecting their four pleas for stopping road widening work. The petitioners had challenged the state government’s notification of November 12, 2014, under MRTP Act, 1966, that allowed NMC to widen the road from 15 to 24m, with a view to reduce congestion.
 
 Meanwhile, the anti-encroachment squad of NMC led by assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Patil razed 13 illegal structures constructed alongside the compound wall of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital. Following resistance from the encroachers, NMC carried out the drive with the help of police.
