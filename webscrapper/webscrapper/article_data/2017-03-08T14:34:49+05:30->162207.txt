LUCKNOW: The   has replaced private company   with   Eco Green following failure of former to improve waste management in city. The new company was brought on board officially on Tuesday.

  has given the new company target to improve waste management and garbage cleaning of city in next 3 months. Additional municipal commissioner P K Srivastava said, “The company took charge of the plant five days ago and is operating it successfully. They have been instructed to minimise littering on roads and streamline garbage collection in the city within three months.”
 
 Jyoti Envirotech had failed to run Shivri’s waste treatment plant in full capacity despite repeated reminders from Jal Nigam and LMC. It had earlier delayed completion of the plant and when it started, it couldn’t run smoothly because of logistic issues. The plant started functioning in early 2016 although the company had committed to begin it by 2014. 
 
 Even after it started, the plant was shut down frequently on account of various problems like delay in salary disbursal, non-payment of electricity dues, lack of garbage vehicles, settlement of tariff with LMC, etc. Its biggest task of collecting garbage door-to-door across 110 wards of city remained unaccomplished. After several reminders and court intervention, the firm was asked to step down.
 
 The bank that extended loan to Jyoti asked for proposals from different companies interested in taking over Jyoti’s financial liabilities and those with experience of operating waste treatment plants. The bank selected Eco Green, which aims to bring all houses within municipal jurisdiction under garbage collection network by September 2017. 
 
 Srivastava said, “The company is also experienced to generate energy from the treated waste. Since the plant’s capacity is quite large—approximately 1,300 metric tonnes daily, we have asked it to begin the project of generating energy from waste even here.”
