AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Friday turned down a petition by one of those accused in the  , Raziuddin Nasir, who demanded discharge on the grounds that he was acquitted by a   court in a case based on same conspiracy.

  Raziuddin, the son of   who was arrested and later acquitted in a   case, first requested the trial court to drop the case against him on the grounds that a similar case was lodged by Karnataka police against him and a court in Hubli acquitted him in February last year on the grounds that he could not be convicted merely by statements from police personnel. There was no evidence against him with regard to the charges of criminal conspiracy, waging war against the nation etc.
 
 The trial court rejected his plea and he moved the HC. Raziuddin submitted that the charges leveled against him in Hubli and in Ahmedabad were based on same set of facts, that he had participated in the Waghamon camp in Kerala, at which members of   and Indian Mujahideen hatched a conspiracy for terror attacks. He accused of going to Pakistan and receiving terror training. He faces all these charges in Ahmedabad also. His counsel argued that after his acquittal in Karnataka, trying Raziuddin again for the same offence would amount to double jeopardy.
 
 The high court rejected the application on the grounds that Karnataka police’s investigation was not proper, as seen from the Hubli court’s 600-page judgment. In the Ahmedabad case, 780 witnesses were examined and none turned hostile. This was also not a stage where the lower court’s order can be disturbed.
