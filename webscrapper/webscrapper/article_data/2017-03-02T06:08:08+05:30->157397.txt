BELAGAVI:   for the past three days has put the lives of at least 53 patients, including newborns in the incubation wing, at peril in   in the district. 

 Sources said power supply to the 100-bed hospital has been intermittent and highly disruptive due to a technical error. Patients are forced to depend on natural ventilation and ad-hoc measures like handheld fans to fight the searing heat.
 
 Critical operations in the hospital - like the operation theatre and incubation centre - have been on the blink. By Wednesday, Hescom re-connected power supply in a temporary measure.
 
  Blame game on: Hescom and the hospital authorities are locked in a blame game over the cause of this problem. Hescom said power supply conked off due to a short circuit in the internal wiring and panel section. Hospital authorities contested this claim and said a transformer burst triggered off the outage. 
 
 After they received a complaint from the hospital around 5pm on February 27, Hescom technicians rushed to the hospital but couldn't identify the problem till late night. This was partly because a Hescom contractor had switched off the generator for a while as technicians noticed reverse flow of electricity into the transformer.
 
 The next day, supply to the hospital was disconnected owing to a short circuit in the panel board. Hescom electricians could identify the problem only after examining the internal wiring and panel board.
 
 Hescom assistant executive engineer   told TOI they cut off the supply after they discovered that cables were at least 15 years old and the   could not handle the present-day load.
 
 Hospital medical officer Dr S S Gaded said when the institution was built in 2001 as a 50-bed facility, the wiring was carried out to meet those requirements. Later, the hospital capacity was doubled, but other infrastructure hasn't been upgraded in equal measure.
 
 Source said the hospital sent repeated reminders to re-wire the electricity network but to no avail.
