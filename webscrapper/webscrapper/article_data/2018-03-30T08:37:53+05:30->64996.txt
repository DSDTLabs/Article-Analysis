ROPAR: In a chance discovery, the   district police came across a large number of weapons and ammunition from Bhakra canal during a search operation being conducted to trace stolen motorcycles. 

 During the search operation, a diver found a plastic bag from the canal in which an imported gun, a .38 bore pistol, .12 bore country-made pistol and two magazines of the imported gun were recovered. 
 
 Police also recovered 206 cartridges (19 used and 187 alive). The discovery shocked the policemen present there. 
 
 Police said the recovered weapons seemed to have been dumped in the recent past as the ammunition could still be used. 
 
 They said it was yet to be ascertained if the ammunition was dumped or was it wrapped and stored in the canal to be taken out and used again by someone.
 
 Ropar senior superintendent of police (SSP)   said, "We were investigating the case of theft registered on March 23 in which accused   and Prem Masih of   were nabbed." 
 
 "During interrogation, they confessed to having dumped the stolen bike in the canal. We took the help of a diver to trace the bike. The diver found a plastic bag near the bike inside the canal," he added.
 
 "When the bag was opened, we found the weapons and ammunition in it. Someone might have tied the bag with a heavy object to avoid it being flown away in the Canal," the SSP added.
 
 Sandhu said it might have been stashed by anti-social elements or gangsters under pressure due to the recent crackdown against the criminals in the state. 
 
 He said a case under the Arms Act was registered at   police station against unidentified persons in the matter.
