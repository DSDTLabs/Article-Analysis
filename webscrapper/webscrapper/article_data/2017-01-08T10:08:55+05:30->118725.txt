CHANDIGARH: Punjab government on Saturday took away the charge of   (VB) department from DGP Suresh Arora amid apprehensions that Election Commission (EC) was planning to point out that the officer was holding two key posts at the time of polls.
 
 Though Arora did not re ply to repeated calls and texts, the Punjab government's one line order read, “The additional charge of the post of chief director, Vigilance Bureau, given to Suresh Arora is with drawn in public interest with immediate effect“.
 
 Special principal secretary to Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal, Gagandeep Brar, said the “decision was on administrative grounds“.
 
 This announcement came 24 hours after the poll watchdog shunted out 14 top cops, including 10 district SSPs.
 
 Arora had recently courted controversy over three cases, including a clean chit give to Congress's likely CM candidate Capt   in October in a 10-year-old case.The row had made AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal allege that SAD and Congress were having 'a friendly match' in the 2017 elections. A note, accessed by TOI, further reveals that Arora on November 9, 2016, attached two new officers for a fresh investigation into another 10year-old corruption case against the then DGP S S Virk.
 
 On December 27, 2016, an IG-rank officer Amardeep Rai, reporting to Arora, replied to him, “To fasten the completion of probe, we need to attach one more officer apart from the two -Patiala DSP   and Fatehgarh Sahib inspector Sanjiv Kumar“.
 
 Three weeks ago, the VB had conducted raids at rebel Akali Dal MP  's Faridkot college. A day after this, his two sons and wife joined Congress. Ghubaya had dubbed the VB raids as a 'dirty trick' by the SAD government.
 
 The opposition had levelled charges before the EC that Punjab's VB was misused by the SAD government to distribute money , liquor and drugs in the polls.
 
 The VB had also courted a row over giving a clean chit to former agriculture minister Tota Singh in a graft case.
