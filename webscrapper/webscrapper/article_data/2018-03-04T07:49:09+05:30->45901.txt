LUCKNOW: Even as campaigning for   parliamentary bypoll is on full swing,   candidate   was rushed to SGPGI on Thursday after he fell ill. 

 CM   visited SGPGI on Saturday to take stock of Shukla's health.
 
 Though the top SGPGI brass remained tight lipped on Shukla's condition, sources at the institute said Shukla, who had a history of diabetes, was diagnosed with chronic subdural haemotoma, one of the commonest neuro-surgical conditions. It leads to formation of blood clots between brain and the skull. The clot causes pressure on brain which results in stroke-like symptoms such as slurring of speech, stiffness of limbs, etc.
 
 Head of neurosurgery department and former director of   Rishikesh Prof Raj Kumar took charge of Shukla and planned the Burr Hole Evacuation for management. The procedure was performed on Thursday.
 
 Shukla's illness has hit campaigning. Voting is scheduled on March 11 and the campaigning ends on March 9. Shukla may be discharged on Sunday or Monday. However, he may take time to become fit enough to take part in rigorous campaigning.
