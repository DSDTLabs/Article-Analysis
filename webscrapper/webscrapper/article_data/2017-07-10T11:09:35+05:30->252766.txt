ROORKEE:   (DL) holders in the   are having a tough time getting their licences renewed despite the fact that a transport office was opened in the town three years ago.
 
  According to sources, files and other records related to driving licences are yet to be transferred to Roorkee office from the  , which is delaying the renewal of licences.
  
  Raj Kumar, who have to visit Haridwar for renewal of his licence, said, “I have to waste money and time to get my driving licence renewed from Haridwar, even as there a transport office in Roorkee.”
  
  Considering the trouble of people living in three tehsils — Roorkee, Bhagwanpur and Laksar — in obtaining and renewal of driving licences, registration certificates of vehicles and transfer of ownership after sell and purchase of vehicles, during the previous Congress regime the then transport minister Surendra Rakesh had started a separate regional transport office (RTO) in Roorkee in August 2014.
  
  Although most of the works are done at the Roorkee RTO, for the renewal of licences, people have to visit  . Since its operation, the Roorkee RTO has issued 31,432 licences till June 30.
  
  Shailesh Kumar Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), Roorkee, said, “Licence renewal work will be done after we get records of those licences from Haridwar.”
  
  It is believed that a big chunk of licence holders from the Roorkee region are registered with the Haridwar RTO, which does not want to lose them.
  
  Haridwar RTO officials said their office had 1,20889 online driving licences and 48,000 manual driving licences till August 2014 in their record, thus the transfer of files or data to the Roorkee RTO would take time. “It is not an easy job,” said Manish Tiwari, ARTO, Haridwar.
