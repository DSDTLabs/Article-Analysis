CHENNAI: While as many as 40,000   drivers went on   in the city on Wednesday, several others chose to ply their vehicles despite being hit by dipping incentives.

 P Arumugam*, an   driver partner, completed eight rides on Wednesday. He says while there is an issue with the incentives, a strike isn’t the ideal way to handle the matter. Senthil Selvam* wasn’t so lucky. Fellow drivers roughed him up when he took his car out. “It isn’t easy to achieve the targets but that is up to each individual. If you feel it is difficult, you don’t have to chase the incentives,” he said. 
 
 Responding to the drivers’ demands, cab aggregator Uber said driving with it is different from working as a private driver. “Currently, 80% of drivers across India who are online for more than six hours a day make between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500 net, after Uber’s service fee. Driver partners using the Uber app place real value on flexibility and consistently tell us this is one of the most attractive aspects of driving using the Uber app,” said an Uber spokesperson.
 
 He said the company maintains transparency on incentives and retains a service fee of 20% for all rides in India, irrespective of the city or the type of vehicle chosen by the rider. 
 
 “We need to balance the needs of riders and drivers. Uber rolls out incentives and promotions to introduce the service in new cities. Without this, it’s hard to ensure drivers are compensated for their time when few riders are aware of the service. As more riders use Uber, drivers are busier and can earn more. This attracts more drivers, which helps guarantee faster pickups for riders, and allows us to adjust incentives over time. With sustained high demand from both riders and drivers we can shift from startup mode to a more sustainable business model and begin reducing higher levels of incentives, and invest more in drivers and our products for the long term,” added the spokesperson.
