Indore: Commissioning of the waste to energy (WTE) plant at the Devguradia   is being on basis of Supreme Court’s order dated 2006, the Indore Municipal Corporation told the high court on Monday, during the arguments on an application seeking stay on the WTE plan.

 The interim application has been filed by Kishore Kodwani challenging the waste management system of Indore. The application was heard by the division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Virendra Singh, who reserved the order on the application.
 
 The application was filed on the waste to energy plant at the Devguradia. The application seeks a stay on the work order issued by the state government to the contractor on March 31.
 
 However, according to the IMC, no such work order has been issued. “The state government has finalized the bid and also declared the successful bidder. But no work order has been issued,” Manoj Munshi, counsel representing the IMC said.
 
 The petitioner in his interim application had also claimed that the WTE plant is being implemented without the proposal and resolutions from panchayats of nearby tehsils including Mhow, Depalpur, Rau and Manpur. The petitioner also said that the cost of installation of the WTE plant will be a burden on the public.
 
 “According to a report by the ministry of Urban Development, the cost of waste management system for a city like Indore must amount to Rs 41 crore. But, the government is spending much more and that the public money is getting wasted,” petitioner Kishore Kodwani said.
 
 On these allegations, the IMC said that the petitioner has not been able to produce a copy of the mentioned report and that the cost of installation of the WTE plant will be borne jointly by the Centre and the state government. Based on these arguments, IMC asked for the application to be dismissed.
