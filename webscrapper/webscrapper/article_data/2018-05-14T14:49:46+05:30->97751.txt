NAGPUR: CBSE   students in Nagpur will have a simpler junior college admission process to follow if changing over to state board, because the ‘grading’ system has been chucked from this year.

 From 2011-17,   Std X students would get grades, instead of marks, because of the Continuous and Comprehension Evaluation ( ) scheme. The school principal would then give attested letter stating actual marks obtained by the student which in turn would be considered by state education department under the Common Admission Procedure (CAP).
 
 Starting this year, CBSE returned to the traditional board exam format and students would be getting a mark sheet rather than grade sheet. Students can now simply take their marksheet and submit it for verification at the guidance centres thus cutting out the extra work of getting an attested statement of marks.
 
 Also since students who appeared for school-based Std X exam were not allowed to take admission in state junior colleges, those who appeared for regular board exam also had to prove it through a principal’s letter. The latter was a practice which was not sincerely followed, but the rule was definitely in place. But now that too has become redundant with CBSE’s traditional exam making a comeback.
 
 For CAP, CBSE students have to visit guidance centres located in various parts of the city and get their online form filled there itself. Details of the guidance centres are available on https://nagpur.11thadmission.net and only those students from outside city or from non-state board schools need to visit there.
 
 Since last year, CAP in Nagpur has been shifted completely online and it is mandatory for everyone seeking admission in city colleges to first register. Even admissions under all quotas (minority, inhouse etc) have to be processed online, something which has increased transparency.
