GORAKHPUR: SP president and UP chief minister   rebutted Prime Minister  's charge of discrimination in electricity supply in UP, and said unfounded charges were being levelled against the SP government.

 “They say that the SP government gives more electricity during Ramzan, but we never differentiate between Ramzan and Diwali. Prime Minister Modi said that Ganga Maiyya called him to Banaras, but can he swear on Ganga Maiyya that Varanasi is not getting 24-hour electricity supply?" Akhilesh said at an election rally in Champa Devi Park here on Monday .
 
 He was accompanied by alliance partner, Congress vice-president  .
 
 On his ‘Gujarat ke gadhe' remark, the CM said, “I only talked about an advertisement and people got so emotional that they started talking about the qualities of donkey.”
 
 PM Modi had recited a poem on donkey in Basti during a public meet in reaction to Akhilesh's suggestion to Amitabh Bachchan regarding advertisement of Gujarat donkeys.
 
 Terming Gorakhpur BJP MP Yogi Adityanath as `Baba', the CM said, “Baba says that Gorakhpur doesn't get electricity supply. If he wants to check, he can touch an electricity wire. Please don't get trapped in Baba's net.” Referring to BSP supremo Mayawati as ‘Pathron wali Neta', Akhilesh said voting for BJP means strengthening BSP.
 
 Blaming Modi for fanning communal hatredness, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said Modi had become scared of “our friendship" (SP-Congress alliance) and “when he feels scared he starts spreading hatred”. Rahul said PM Modi betrayed his mother (Ganga Maiya) by making false promises.
