PUNE: State-level developers’ body will meet chief minister   and revenue minister Chandrakant Patil urging them to take up Ready Reckoner (RR) rates revision every third year and also to maintain status quo on the rates for the coming financial year.

 “We will be requesting for a hearing with the chief minister and the revenue minister to request them not to increase the RR rate for the coming financial year.   members also plan to have a series of meetings with MLAs and MPs in the next two months to make them aware of the prevailing situation in the realty sector,” Credai   president Shantilal Kataria told TOI.
 
 Over the years, the RR rates have increased by 10-25%. “We will also request the authorities to announce change in RR rates in March and implement them from April 1 to give ample time to people concerned for easy implementation,” Confederation of   Developers Association of India (Credai) Maharashtra said in a statement.
 
 The developers’ body said the government should put the rates revision on hold in the wake of demonetisation and RERA. “It should be noted that RR rates have been increased by 10-25% every year in the last decade, resulting in more than 300% rise in the rates in many city areas,” Credai said.
 
 With the stamp duty being the second largest revenue generating segment, the ongoing year has seen the increase of 1% in stamp duty in rural and effective areas, which has generated enough revenue for the government. “However, with this random increase in the stamp duty, people are finding it difficult to buy houses and it may remain so in the future as well,” a Credai member said.
 
 He said if the rates are kept unchanged, it would be a boost for various projects being rolled out under affordable housing segment. “People wishing to buy houses are now being made to pay 12% GST and stamp duty. Earlier, they were paying service tax of 5.5%,” he added.
