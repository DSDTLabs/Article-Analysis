Many of us smoke to manage unpleasant feelings such as stress, depression, loneliness, and anxiety. When you have a bad day, it can seem like cigarettes are your only friend. Keep unpleasant feelings in check by doing exercise, meditation, relaxation strategies, or simple breathing exercises. Even when cigarettes are no longer a part of your life, the painful and unpleasant feelings that may have prompted you to smoke in the past will still remain. So it’s worth spending some time thinking about the different ways you intend to deal with stressful situations and the daily irritations that would normally have you lighting up.

 Think about it, smoking damages the lining of your arteries, leading to a build up of fatty material (atheroma) which narrows the artery. This can cause angina, a heart attack or a stroke. The carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke reduces the amount of oxygen in your blood. This means your heart has to pump harder to supply the body with the oxygen it needs. The nicotine in cigarettes stimulates your body to produce adrenaline, which makes your heart beat faster and raises your blood pressure, making your heart work harder. Your blood is more likely to clot, which increases your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. When non-smokers breathe in second-hand smoke - also known as passive smoking - it can be harmful, which means you could be harming the health of your children, partner and friends.
 
 Quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do for your   and health of your loved ones, and the good news is that the risk to your heart health decreases significantly soon after you stop. Below are practical tips to help you stop smoking; 
 
 • Remember that you’re not alone. Your family and friends are there to support you. Make a date to give up - and stick to it! Throw away all your tobacco, lighters and ashtrays.
 
 • Make a plan. Think about what could help you stop smoking. Keep mint, chewing gum handy and have it ready before the date you plan to stop.
 
 • Do something that calms you down, such as taking a warm bath, meditating, reading a book, or practicing deep breathing exercises. Listen to some music you love. Drink lots of water. 
 
 • Get support and let your family and friends know that you're quitting. Remember promises you have given to someone to quit. 
 
 • Keep busy to help take your mind off cigarettes. Try to change your routine, and avoid the shop where you normally buy cigarettes.
 
 Remember, decision to quit has to be yours. Your loved ones are there to support you. Remember strong motivational force to quit in case of cravings. Even if you slip into relapse, remember that your loved ones are not there to preach or judge you but support you. Keep trying, you can do it! If you can, use the money you're saving by not smoking to buy yourself something special. Quit it for your heart and hearts of those you love.
