CHENNAI: There seems to be no respite for residents of PS   in Mylapore, one of the worst affected roads during the 2015 floods. A few weeks ago, a section of residents near the Sanskrit college junction woke up to find that there was literally no way out. 

  (GCC) had dug deep ditches right outside their houses overnight. Sources said this was for a storm water drain (SWD) project, permission for which which had been obtained after 'special sanction', and was being constructed by the bus route roads (BRR) department of GCC.
 
 While residents welcomed the move, the lack of communication has irked them. "This is very troublesome for senior citizens. People who have an alternate opening to their house may not have an issue, but what about those for whom there is only one," said M Chandrasekar, who has been a resident of the street for 27 years. 
 
 Chandrasekar says it has been a month since the road was dug up, but work is progressing very slowly. This has also affected small businesses in the area. Consequently, telephone and internet cables have also been frequently cut due to the work by GCC, say residents.
 
 During the floods in December 2015, Sivaswamy Salai resembled a war zone as underwater sewage pipes had collapsed and there were craters in the middle of the road. A team from Central government had visited the road to study the impact of the floods on people and infrastructure.
 
 PS Sivaswamy Salai is an important route for buses going from   and other southern parts of the city to Royappettah, Triplicane, Chennai Central station and beyond. When the road was not motorable, buses had to take a long detour through the   signal, which led to traffic snarls.
 
 A senior corporation official said directives have been given to complete the work as soon as possible. "We are aware of the inconvenience to the residents. The engineering department has the details regarding when it will be finished," the official said.
