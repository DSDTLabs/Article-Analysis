AHMEDABAD: On February 8, NITI Aayog released a   called, “Healthy States, Progressive India”. The report ranks Gujarat as among the one-third number of states and Union territories which has recorded a decline in its health index in 2015-16, when compared to the base year in 2014.

  
  The   ‘Health Index’ reveals that the overall index for Gujarat reduced by 1.29 index points (from 63.28 index points in 2014 to 61.99 points in 2015-16) and slipped to the fourth position in the country. The health index for states innovatively measures their year-on-year incremental change in health outcomes, as well as, their overall performance with respect to each other.
 
 The report states that it is a “matter of concern” and that the index “should nudge the states like Kerala, Gujarat, and Himachal Pradesh into reviewing and revitalizing their programmatic efforts. These states have shown a decline in performance from base year in 2014 to reference year in 2015-16, despite some of them being among the top ten in overall performance.” 
 
 The report says that Gujarat registered a significant decline in sex ratio at birth (907 to 854 females per 1,000 males) that dragged down its incremental progress in the index. Kerala also registered a decline in sex ratio at birth from base to reference year (974 to 967 females per 1,000 males). Haryana which already registered a negative incremental score performed poorly due to increase in under 5 mortality rate (40 to 43 per 1,000 live births) and decline in the sex ratio at birth (866 to 831 females per 1,000 males).
 
 The Ayog made an observation that “12 states — Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Haryana, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Assam and Madhya Pradesh — with under 5 years mortality rate and above 35 deaths per 1,000 live births will require concerted effort,” to improve the situation.
 
 Also among all states and Union territories, Dadra and Nagar Haveli reported the highest percentage of low birth weight (which is 35% in the base year in 2014 and 29% in the reference year 2015-16). Other States with a high, which is greater than 15% proportion of low birth weight newborns include Haryana, West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Rajasthan and Goa.
