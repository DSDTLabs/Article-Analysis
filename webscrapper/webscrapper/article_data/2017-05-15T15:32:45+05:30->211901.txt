LUCKNOW: 'Bagh' (tiger) is a mystery to men who live in forest-villages in UP! Many have only heard of the feline but never seen it.

 Strangely, most of the people in informative workshops held by forest department in villages inside or on fringes of tiger reserves cannot describe a tiger.
 
 To avoid  , people living in forest-villages in UP will now be shown the feline. 
 
 Villagers will be brought to the   in batches and shown how a tiger looks like and how it behaves. Men living inside or on fringes of tiger reserves will also be exposed to behaviour of leopards. 
 
 Most of these people do not know what colour a tiger or a leopard is, who has stripes and spots of the two, leave alone knowing of the big cats' behaviour, their growl or roar.
 
 "On most occasions, especially those who have seen a tiger from distance, would recollect it to be similar to a buffalo or a blue bull. Many say they have fought with a 'strange' animal to save their cattle. The strange animal, as per their accounts, appears to be a tiger or a leopard," said a forest department worker.
 
 Tiger reserves in the state have a high man-animal conflict. Men either die or are left crippled for the life. Tigers face a backlash. There have been incidents reported from   in the past where tigers were poisoned.
 
 "Whenever a tiger strays out of the forest and we start a rescue operation, there is a crowd of people from several villagers who come to only see a tiger," said landscape coordinator, WWF-India, UP, Mudit Gupta.
 
 But, now the primary response teams and protection squads formed at the village level will be brought to the zoo in batches and trained to handle man-animal conflict.
 
 Though forest officers have been conducting workshops on animal behaviour in the wild on and off, to get people see the animal is the most essential part. "One can escape the tiger only when one knows the animal," said a forest officer.
