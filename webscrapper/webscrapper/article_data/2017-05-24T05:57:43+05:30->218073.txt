CHENNAI: The sale of   on the   has got a boost with the launch of the   from   on May 14. Since the inauguration of services on the underground line, a total of 1,23,827 smart cards have been sold. The card sales have picked up because point-to-point   are not sold at stations on the underground line, with smart cards being the only option.

 With 28 km of the line now open to the public and patronage going up, smart cards seem to have become the best option to travel as they offer discounts. The smart card fare for travel from Nehru Park to St Thomas Mount metro stations is Rs 45 as against Rs 50 for tokens and from Nehru Park to the airport is Rs 54 as against Rs 60 for tokens.
 
 A senior official of metro rail said, “We are looking at making smart cards the norm. People will get used to the convenience of buying a smart card. The card needs to be purchased only once. It can be recharged using the machines that are kept at all stations.”
 
 However, tokens are still available for purchase at elevated stations. Metro rail is also planning to popularise a few other cards like a multiple trip tourist card costing Rs 100 for those who would prefer to travel along the line several times on the same day. Store value cards are also being promoted. This card is the same as a smart card with the advantage that it is transferable to family and friends.
 
 Following the inauguration of the underground line, a total of 2,82,621 passengers have travelled on the metro as compared to 20,25,439 commuters this year until the launch.
