VADODARA: A 46-year-old man from West Bengal was arrested in the city for circulating counterfeit Rs 2,000 currency notes on Thursday. 

 The accused   was nabbed near the   and 42 notes of Rs 2,000 denomination were seized from him. The special operations group (SOG) sleuths were surprised to find so many   of the Rs 2,000 currency that was introduced by the government just some months ago. 
 
 “We had received information that some person was circulating fake notes of Rs 2,000 by buying groceries and other items. We kept a watch in the area and arrested him. Sheikh said that he came to the city on February 11 and used to sleep at the railway station,” said H M Vyas, SOG police inspector . 
 
 Police said that Sheikh had brought 50 fake currency notes and he came to the city to circulate them. 
 
 “Sheikh works as a casual labourer and he had got the fake notes from Malda district in West Bengal. We will investigate the case in detail as the Malda is the hub of fake currency notes. We will seek his remand from the local court on Friday,” Vyas told TOI. 
 
 The police have in the past arrested several persons who came to the city from West Bengal for circulating fake currency notes.
