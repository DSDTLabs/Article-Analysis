Filmmaker  , who is close to completing three decades as an independent producer and director, is all set to roll out with his next, ' ' ('EHTEDT').
 
 The film is a musical mystery featuring Suneel’s son Shiv Darshan, Upen Patel and debutante Natasha Fernandes. “I’m directing a film after a sizeable gap,” says the filmmaker, adding, “I realised that I have to make a film keeping in mind the present times and yet, keep the concept timeless. That’s when I scripted 'EHTEDT'. 
 
 Since music has always been an integral part of his ventures, Suneel has ensured that the soundtrack of his new film lives up to expectations. “I started work only after my composer Nadeem (of Nadeem-Shravan fame) created some fascinating scores for me,” he says.
 
 About his film’s title, he says, “'EHTEDT' suits the subject of the film and coincidentally, closely resembles the lines of Subhash Ghai’s legendary song from Karz.” A sizeable chunk of the film was shot across the United Kingdom, over a 50-day schedule.
 
 Post 'EHTEDT', which is scheduled to release this summer, Suneel is planning to start work on two more projects. Over the years, he has worked with top stars and made films like Jaanwar (1999), Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Andaaz (2003), Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya (2002), Talaash: The Hunt Begins (2003), Lootere (1993), Ajay (1996) and Dosti:   Forever (2005), among others, under his banner, Shree Krishna International.
