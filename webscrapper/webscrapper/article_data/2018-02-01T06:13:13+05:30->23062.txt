BENGALURU: In a move to promote non-motorized forms of transport — walking and cycling in plain speak — the   ( ) plans to develop and upgrade about 40km of footpaths around   stations in the city. The idea of the project is to encourage people in the vicinity to walk to Metro stations instead of depending on motorised modes of transport.

 The Palike has already begun the process of preparing a detailed project report. Once
 
 implemented, these footpaths will rival TenderSure walkways. Where possible — subject to width — the BBMP plans to lay cycle lanes to promote non-motorized transport.
 
 Documents accessed by TOI show the civic agency will develop footpaths around MG Road, Indiranagar, Byappanahalli (east corridor), Deepanjalinagar, Mysuru Road (west corridor), Jayanagar, JP Nagar (south corridor) stations among others.
 
 “It will take about a month to prepare a detailed project report once we zero in on an agency,” said Prabhakara B, executive engineer, road infrastructure -special division, BBMP. “After that we will start the ground work. Some parts of pedestrian infrastructure around MG Road station have already been upgraded. Similar work will be undertaken around other Metro stations as well.” Based on the report, work will be extended to other stations. In all, the BBMP has budgeted Rs 90 crore for the project.
 
 Urban expert ASK Pani welcomed the move, but said the civic body should have started the exercise long ago. “This should have been done when Metro services began in the city,” Pani said. “This late reaction by the BBMP has forced  ,  , cabs or autorickshaws to reach stations. Still, it is better late than never. The civic body should speed up implementation of the project.”
