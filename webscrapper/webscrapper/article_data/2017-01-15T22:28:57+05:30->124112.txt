MUMBAI: After six years of running and winning half marathons all over the country, Kolhapur's   is finally ready to take the next step - the 41km full marathon.
 
 Soon after she won the women's 21km run of the   with a timing of 1:19:13 on Sunday, Monika declared that she's done with half marathons. Maybe the five marathons she's participated in between November-December 2016 have taken their toll. 
 
 "I was running practically every Sunday. My body was tired. I ran the Hyderabad 10km, then won the Vasai-Virar half marathon, then the Bhopal half marathon, set my personal best at the Delhi half marathon (1:15:34), and also set my personal best at the 25km Kolkata run (1:34:15). So yes, it has been quite an eventful two months. Thankfully, I got some rest before coming to Mumbai," said the 24-year-old. For the record, Monika also set her personal best in the 5000m run in September last year (16:37.45 in Lucknow).
  
 So what made her decide to ditch her pet race and try for the longer format? "A full marathon is the ultimate test. I want to see how capable I am. I've spoken to the doctors and they gave me an approval. I'm actually aiming to participate in the marathon at the World Championships in London this year."
  
 And how is her preparation going? "I haven't started training yet. In fact, the longest I've run is 30 kms. I'll run 38 kms this week and gradually progress. I need a timing of 2 hours 45 minutes to qualify for the World Championships. I hope I can run that at the   next month," she said.
  
 Did she get motivation from her former roommates and training partners, Olympians Lalita   and OP  ? Quite the opposite, actually.
  
 "Looking at Jaisha's state I'm actually scared. She has to undergo such rigorous training. But at the same time, I love a challenge, and there's nothing more challenging for me than running a full marathon."
