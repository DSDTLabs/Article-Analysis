VARANASI: Mocking at CM  's claim of no discrimination in power supply, PM   asked the gathering if there was need to swear by Ganga to tell there is no 24-hour electricity in Varanasi as those who claimed otherwise experienced the reality when power snapped as they went to offer prayers at Kashi Vishwanath temple in the evening. 

 "Do you all receive 24-hour, electricity," the PM asked the gathering at Maidagin Town Hall in City South constituency and when they all replied with a resounding "No", the PM said now there is no need to swear by the Ganga.
