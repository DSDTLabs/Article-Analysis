BENGALURU: More skeletons seem to have t umbled out of the Bellandur preschool closet. On Thursday, the parent of a two-and-a-half-year-old claimed her child had been assaulted by   V, the staffer who allegedly molested a three-year-old girl last week. 

  This comes after the parents of six more children on Wednesday lodged complaints of sexual assault against office boy Manjunath, who was arrested last Friday, and other school officials. 
 
  The mother of the two-and-a-half-year-old said the child was attacked after just one month of joining the playschool and had been complaining about the school and 'uncle'. "We took up the issue several times, but the management told us Manjunath was trustworthy and my child may have some adjustment issues due to being away from home," the mother said, adding that she will file an FIR at the HAL police station. 
 
  "I wondered why my child's clothes were being changed thrice a day. None of the other clothes was dirty enough to be changed. After the first complaint was filed, I began to join the dots. Every time we tried to speak to the school, it refused to take concrete action," the mother said. 
 
  More kids victimized? 
 
  Thirty more children could have fallen prey to Manjunath aka Manju Bhaiya's abuse. Harish Bhuvan, a volunteer working with   who's helping the parents with the legal course of action in the case, said many other parents are waiting to see how things unfold before stepping forward to lodge complaints. 
 
  Police, meanwhile, have begun investigations into the seven molestation cases.
