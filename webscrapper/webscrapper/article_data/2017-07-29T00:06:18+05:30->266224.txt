Mumbai: While teachers assessing Mumbai   papers online have blamed technical glitches to be the major drawback they faced during the process, MeritTrac, the   has attributed it to manual errors and delayed start of the project.

 Nagendran Sundarajan, executive vice-president, MeritTrac, said inputs given to them had errors. “If a physics teacher is tagged as a chemistry one, we are helpless. There have been manual errors at the university level too. Ideally, these projects start well in advance, unfortunately the university did not have all data before we started. Teachers did not send details in the prescribed format,” he said, adding that at their end, generating the one-time passwords (OTP) was a problem. Also, if 250 colleges were able to log in and there were connectivity issues at a few centres, there could have been a bandwidth problem too.
 
 On the allegation that MeritTRac is using outsourced software, he said, “We use many technologies, we use other platforms, it does not mean the software is outsourced. If we get the correct input, we can promise a better outcome.” He added that they are the first ones to bring on-screen assessment to India.
 
 But teachers claimed that   persisted on Friday. “Some papers in a commerce subject were either not scanned properly or were loaded together with different marking schemes,” said a teacher.
 
 Officer on special duty of assessment, Vinayak Dalvie, said the university was focusing on bringing out   in science and technology courses in a day or two. In a Facebook post on Friday, economics professor, Neeraj Hatekar, lashing out at Dalvie for threatening teachers with stringent action and stated he has no authority to take disciplinary action against teachers. He even alleged that Bhalchandra Mungekar, former vice-chancellor, who sought vice-chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh’s resignation two days ago, did not have good administrative capacities.
