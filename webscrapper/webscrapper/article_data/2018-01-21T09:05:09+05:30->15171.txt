VADODARA: Despite being one of the biggest controversies to hit the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in the recent past, not a word was uttered regarding the   slum rehabilitation project during Saturday’s coordination meeting of elected representatives called by the VMC. Manjalpur BJP MLA   who had locked horns with VMC commissioner Vinod Rao was also present in the meeting along with Rao.

 Patel raised the issue of the timber market land involving   – one of the partners of the joint venture – that has taken up the rehabilitation project. But none of the legislators present at the meeting raised the Sanjaynagar slum rehabilitation row.
 
 All MLAs from the city present in the meeting including Patel, Sayajigunj MLA Jitendra Sukhadiya, Vadodara City MLA Manisha Vakil and Akota MLA   said that the issue was not raised during the meeting. They pointed out that the discussion revolved around development works in the city. Even VMC functionaries said that the issue was not discussed at the meeting.
 
 Patel and Rao had found themselves on the opposite sides during the controversy. Rao had issued notices to the JV due to alleged irregularities while Patel had raised the issue with the chief minister arguing that injustice was being done. When Patel’s name was dragged into the row, Patel went all out making allegations against Rao. Things calmed down only after Rao met Patel at his residence on Thursday.
 
 Patel denied to comment on the reason why he did not raise the issue in the meeting. Raopura MLA Rajendra Trivedi was not present at the meeting.
