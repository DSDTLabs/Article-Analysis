Madurai: The city police on Tuesday released two   on traffic rules. The 3-minute videos depict the importance of wearing helmet and proper usage of pedestrian crossings. 

 Madurai city police commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal released the videos in the presence of deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Balagopalan. Earlier, the commissioner flagged off an awareness rally on road rules as a part of ongoing Road Safety Week observation.
 
 The short film on the zebra crossing grabbed the attention of the viewers for its concept and execution. It shows how the motorists show no respect to the pedestrian crossings at traffic signals. Then it shows pedestrians climbing over the vehicles to cross the road. Realising their fault, the motorists take their vehicles back to give way for the pedestrians.
 
 The recently-launched traffic awareness vehicle has already reached over 35,000 people so far. The commissioner said they have plans to show the short films in theatres and in local cable television channels.
 
 Talking to newsmen after the video release, the commissioner said that the city police was taking all possible effort to bring down road fatality. Already the city police have registered more than 91,000 cases of traffic rule violation. He said that lightings, barricades and road markings have been improved.
 
 To catch those jumping signal lines red handed, the city police have installed cameras at Goripalayam and Periyar signals. “The cameras can capture both the signal light and the vehicle violating the signal line in the same frame. Those who violate the rule would be traced. It is not to fine them, but to make them realize the mistake and make sure they do not repeat the offence,” he said.
 
 He said that the city police have sent proposals to set up two more police stations by bifurcating Tallakulam and Anna Nagar police stations, which have vast area to cover. The stations are likely to come up at Vandiyur and Thiruppalai, he said.
