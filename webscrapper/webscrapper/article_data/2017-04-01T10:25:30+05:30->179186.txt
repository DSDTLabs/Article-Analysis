AHMEDABAD: Despite the state government pumping in cash in its   undertakings, the return on capital employed (RoCE) has declined to a five-year-low of 4.27% in 2015-16.

 The   for 2015-2016 on PSUs for the year ended March 31, 2016. The state has 86 SPSUs of which 72 are operational. 
 
 The turnover of these undertakings increased from Rs. 79,641.86 crore in 2011-12 to Rs. 1,11,036.50 crore in 2015-16. Similarly, the investment also jumped from Rs. 74,452.30 crore to Rs. 1,29,178.86 during the same period.
 
 The contribution of these firms to the Gross State Domestic Products (GSDP) has also been gradually decreasing, the report added. 
 
 Out of the total working SPSUs, 49 made a profit of Rs. 2,854.27 crore. However, only eight declared dividend of Rs. 237.67 crore, of which the state government’s share was Rs. 94.21 crore.
 
 “The state government may consider formulation of a dividend policy regarding payment of reasonable return from the profit earning SPSUs on the paid up share capital contribution by the state government,” the CAG report suggested.
 
 As far as 14 non-working SPSUs are concerned, eight of them have commenced the liquidation process. The state government was advised to wind up six non-working state-run companies. Similar recommendation was made in 2013-14 and 2014-15 audit reports but the government did not take any decision till December 2016, the report noted.
