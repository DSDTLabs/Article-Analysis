NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old man working at an industrial complex in Narela died after being stuck in a   for nearly an hour on Monday morning. Following the incident, other workers at the factory went on a rampage and damaged police vehicles and an ambulance.

 Police said that the lift had malfunctioned and the victim,  , had resorted to opening the door manually. However, at that very moment, the lift started moving and Mohammad got stuck in between the lift car and the wall between two floors. 
 
 An hour later, when other workers tried using the lift, they found Mohammad’s body stuck in between two floors and informed the management about the incident. Locals said that his head had gotten crushed between the wall and the lift car. Workers had to cut open the car with gas cutters to remove the body.
 
 Preliminary investigations suggest that the lift might have stopped working due to poor maintenance. Other labourers said that the lift had been   for quite some time. “We had reported to the management about it several times but they refused to repair the lift,” said one of the workers who protested near Narela Police station. 
 
 A crime and disaster management team had to be called in to recover the body after it fell into the pit under the lift. Police filed an FIR for death due to negligence. 
 
 It was found that the lift was used to carry plastic pellets that were produced in the factory and was poorly maintained for the past few years due to which it might have worn off.
