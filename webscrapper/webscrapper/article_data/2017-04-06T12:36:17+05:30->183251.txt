 “Rap-star”   has created some amazing numbers for the audience to groove at. His rap style totally complimented   Khan’s wrestler avatar in ‘Sultan’, and it proved that when Sallu and Badshah collaborate, the music just gets better.

 In an exclusive interview with an entertainment website, Bollywoodlife, Badshah revealed that they will come together yet again this year for a film. Even though the rapper did not reveal any details about the film or the song with Salman, he did confirm working on the project.
 
 Badshah will also be on the Da-bang tour and will be performing with   in Australia and New Zealand. The singer seemed enthused and pepped about the upcoming tour. ‘Akira’ actress Sonakshi Sinha will also be performing with Badshah during the tour. 
 
 If we were to guess the project in which the duo will be working together, we can only think of two movies, ‘Tubelight’ or ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’. Now, the reason why our wild guesses are on these two is because these are the only two upcoming projects of Salman Khan which have been creating quite a buzz among the fans. 
 
 Guess, we will just have to wait it out to know more the kickass collaboration.
