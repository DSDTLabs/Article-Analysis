  : In an attempt to come up with an inclusive and comprehensive budget for the year 2017-18, chief minister  , along with deputy chief minister  , held a pre-budget consultative meeting with various community-based organizations (CBOs) on Monday. 

 The budget is proposed to be placed in the state assembly, scheduled from March 6 to 15, an official report said on Tuesday.
 
 "It is the endeavour of the state government to be innovative in preparing the state budget by incorporating valid suggestions and concerns of all communities of the state. CBOs representing their tribes would be in a better place to suggest ways and means to the government for the development and welfare of their own communities," Khandu said.
 
 This year's budget will be based on a pan-Arunachal concept, he said.
 
 Finance minister Chowna Mein said there will be radical shift in the "mode" of the budget this year onwards. "There will be no 'Plan' and 'Non-Plan' heads in this budget as it used to be but it will be broadly divided into two categories - 'Capital' and 'Revenue' heads," he said. The Centre has implemented this model from this year.
 
 Mein said there would only be a State Annual Development Agenda (SADA) under BE and, hence, no   (SDC) meet will be held to finalize budgetary proposals.
