MUMBAI: Clad in a green kurta, black leggings and off-white  , she walks up creaky wooden stairs at an old building at Hazrat Abbas Street in Dongri. Men and women who welcome her in are a bit startled by the sudden footfalls and appeals for votes for the girl who warmly shakes hands with women but greets men with folded hands.

 She is  , the Congress candidate from Ward 223 (Dongri). She wears a headscarf while campaigning in the Muslim pockets of the ward. The ward is over 60% Muslim after delimitation and, since dress is a very touchy subject with traditional families, especially when it comes to women, Nikita, daughter of three-time Congress corporator Dnyanraj Nikam, is not taking a chance. 
 
 “I feel quite comfortable in it. In fact, a Muslim friend had gifted me a headscarf when I was in college. I didn’t wear it then but now I am in hijab when I visit Muslim homes as it helps me establish a better bond,” said 26-year-old Nikita, an MCom and MBA, adding that everyone should have a choice to choose his or her dress. “Someone has gifted me a burqa too, but I have not worn it yet,” said she.
 
 After the Congress nominated Nikita, many of her supporters worried about her “appeal” among Muslim voters. After all, Nikita has to contend with the likes of two-time Congress corporator from Ward 222 Waqarunnisa Ansari, who quit the party when 30% of her ward got added to Ward 221 to create Ward 223 and she was denied a ticket. Of the six candidates in this women’s ward, at least two — Waqarunnisa Ansari of MIM and Neda Fathima of the SP — wear the burqa.
 
 Rubina Ayub Khan, a Congress worker and old Nikam supporter, suggested Nikita wear a headscarf while visiting Muslim homes. “I bought a pair of headscarves for Nikita, who is like my daughter as I have seen her grow up since she was a child. As she is new to the voters, we thought of campaigning door-to-door with Nikita in hijab, as that is how most Muslim girls in the area appear in public,” said Khan.
