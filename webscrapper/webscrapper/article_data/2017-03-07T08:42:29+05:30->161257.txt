MADURAI: The   has bagged the   for source segregation of waste at the doorstep, an achievement the corporation commissioner S   is proud of as he is a native of Tirunelveli town. 

 Sivasubramanian said he had done the planning using a five pronged approach. "First, I made my staff visit all the 1.50 lakh households with a notebook and obtain an undertaking from each of them, to comply with the segregation technique. Subsequently, individual letters were sent through post from the commissioner's office to each of the houses seeking their cooperation,'' he said. It was the women who made the effort possible, he said. "I realised that most women listen to the local FM channels and decided to capitalize on this. I began talking to the public through these channels. One hundred per cent compliance has been achieved,'' he said.
 
 The houses were told only plastics would be collected on Wednesdays, starting from Dec 19. If they handed over unsegregated garbage, they were asked to pay a service charge of 10 on the spot. Residents began complying to avoid paying the fee.   collectors are allowed to sell the plastics they collect. Each one earns anywhere between 50 to 100.
