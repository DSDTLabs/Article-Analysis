CALANGUTE: Tourism-related activities find perfunctory mention in the manifestos of   and   the two main contestants for the   seat ahead in the upcoming assembly elections.

 Major issues awaiting resolution, like disputes over beach shacks, water sports, tourist taxis or private rent-a-cabs, have also been given a miss in both manifestos.
 
 With traffic snarls being a constant problem in the area, construction of a bypass road from Calangute to Sinquerim via interior areas, to decongest the existing Calangute-Candolim road is one of the main promises in BJP candidate Lobo’s manifesto. 
 
 The manifesto of Lobo’s Congress counterpart Sequeira, however, makes no mention of a bypass, but promises ‘better connectivity by building internal roads’. 
 
 Both contestants have promised to upgrade existing medical facilities and electricity infrastructure.
 
 Lobo’s manifesto also promises a new multi-purpose sports complex, community hall, stray animal shelter, a sewage system for Candolim, dredging of the Baga and Sinquerim creeks, besides an ‘entertainment zone’ for music and other festivals. 
 
 Sequeira’s manifesto promises state-of-the-art infrastructure for sports, besides more higher educational institutions and a new market complex with a bus stand on the outskirts of Calangute. He has also promises to make the village a beggar- and hawker-free zone.
 
 Both candidates’ manifestos also focus on youth and women empowerment. Support for farming and agriculture also find mention.
