GURUGRAM:   has given a week’s   to owners of 27   and nine other commercial structures on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, asking them to comply with the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Act — under which they are expected to get change of   use (CLU) done for the land by this month-end — failing which, it has threatened to raze them. 

 After the DTCP conducted a survey last month along the expressway, it identified 36 structures between Bilaspur and the Gurugram-Rewari border for demolition, if they don’t get CLU done. These include nine commercial establishments — workshops, shops and service centres. This stretch includes revenue estates of villages Rathiwas, Bhorakalan and Siddhrawali.
 
 The department had originally planned to carry out the demolition drive on Wednesday i.e. May 23, for which, it had issued notices to the owners on May 15, and even pasted them on the structures on May 18. However, two dhaba owners approached district court for relief, following which, the DTCP director general gave them seven more days to comply. 
 
 “The relief is only till May-end. After June 1, action can be taken against these structures. We advise them to get CLUs and regularise their structures, or remove them,” said Rajender Sharma, district town planner (enforcement). 
 
 Lal Singh, who owns Old Hotel near Siddhrawali, is one of the petitioners seeking exemption from court. According to sources,in 2009, Singh had taken permission for 313 sq m of land, though by now, the structure there is allegedly spread over almost double the area. “I’ve not encroached upon anyone’s land. I’ve just upgraded my dhaba with modern amenities and washrooms, which even the prime minister has been insisting upon,” Singh told TOI.
