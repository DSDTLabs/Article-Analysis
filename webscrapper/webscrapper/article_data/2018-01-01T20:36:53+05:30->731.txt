MANGALURU: The   has got a bit of a shocker with the daughter of a prominent   allegedly fleeing with a   to get married. Miffed with increasing number of such cases in the district, Hindutva leaders have submitted a complaint to the countryâ€™s defence minister to act sternly against Love Jihad.

 The couple has reportedly registered their marriage in Mumbai. However, the 23-year-old girl is now back home in Mangaluru. In interesting turns of events, the man, Mohammed Eqbal Chowdary, a resident of Mankurd in Mumbai, has filed a complaint with the Mumbai Commissioner of Police that a gang, suspected to be men from the saffron brigade in Mangaluru, kidnapped his wife from Inorbit Mall in Mumbai one evening. However, the local media stated that the girl, in an affidavit which has been forwarded to the Maharashtra police, has mentioned that she has come back on her own accord.
 
 Though the girl, a law student, fled five months ago, the incident has come to light only now.
 
 The Hindutva leader originally hails from Kasaragod. He has been residing with his family in the city since several years. His daughter had been studying at a private college. She came in contact with the Chowdary, a technician, a few years ago through Facebook. The friendship then turned into love. Five months ago, she fled to Mumbai in order to start a new life with Chowdary.
 
 The saffron outfit members have submitted a memorandum to Defence Minister   against such cases during her recent visit to the coastal city.
 
 The incident comes to the fore on the back of a similar case wherein a 25 year old Hindu woman fled with a Muslim youth, just little over a day before she was supposed to enter wedlock with a man from the same community as hers. Saffron outfits have been fuming with such cases labelling all of them as cases of Love Jihad.
