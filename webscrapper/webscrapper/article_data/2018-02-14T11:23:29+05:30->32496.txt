PONDA: Labourers at the construction site of the bridge near Khandepar-  road continue to toil without any safety measures, despite clear instructions to the contrary from the government. The workers do not even wear helmets and risk stray objects falling on them.

 The work of six-laning the 7km road from Khandepar to Ponda, being done by Telangana-based MVR  , has been underway since July 2015. The project, worth approximately Rs 500 crore, comprises several bridges, elevated roads and service roads. Almost all the bridges on the way have been completed, except two near the Maruti Temple at Ponda where poles and girders have been erected and spanning work is going on.But, neither the workers welding girders over the poles nor those providing huge iron channels from the ground wear any safety equipment like gloves or helmets. When questioned why they did not do so, some labourers revealed they have not been provided with helmets or gloves.
 
 After being apprised of the situation, PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said the main engineer and contractor is responsible for such lapses. “There are clear-cut instructions that the company should look after the safety of labourers,” Dhavalikar told TOI. 
 
 The government takes from contractors a deposit of 5% of the total cost of a tender for safety and in case of any lapses, can forfeit the amount. 
 
 MVR Infraprojects’ G Satish, however, claimed helmets and gloves have been provided, but the labourers avoid using them. .
