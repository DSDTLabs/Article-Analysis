GAYA: A probationer DSP Prakash Sagar undergoing training in   was caught in a row for smoking in public place during duty hours near the   temple on Monday. A penalty of Rs 200 was imposed on the probationer for violating the ban on smoking at a public place, more so near a place of worship.
 
  Sources present at the spot said what landed the probationer in more trouble was his arrogance. When an officer of the   (GMC) reminded the probationer DSP that he was committing a wrong by violating the ban on smoking at public places and that too while on   duty, the trainee police officer, instead of acknowledging his mistake got engaged in a verbal duel with the   official.
  
  Enraged by the probationer's conduct, the sanitary staff of the corporation went on lightning strike and they relented only after the intervention of senior district officials and imposition of penalty on the officer.
  
  Asked whether the probationer's misconduct would be recorded in his service book, Gaya DM   said the service book of probationers is maintained. “However, the officer's future conduct would be kept under observation,” said the DM.
  
  The DM also maintained that realising his mistake, the probationer DSP voluntarily deposited the penalty for smoking in public place.
