HYDERABAD: The state government’s decision to scrap compulsory rural service for post-graduate doctors may seem to be a bad move and could cripple healthcare in villages, but the government has in fact hammered out a blueprint to ensure that a sizeable number of PG doctors do opt for rural service.

 The department has done a balancing act by adding a clause for additional 30% weightage on marksheet of MBBS students willing to serve in rural and tribal areas. Fresh MBBS passouts who serve for three years in remote areas will get additional weightage of marks for admissions to PG courses.
 
 An in-service quota (30% in clinical courses and 50% in non-clinical course) for PG doctors has been given for service in tribal/rural areas, but quotas won’t be allowed after the new decision.
 
 Also measures to increase number of PG seats and setting up of four more medical colleges at Mahabubnagar, Siddipet, Nalgonda and Suryapet are expected to raise the overall pool of PG students ‘willingly’ opting for rural service.
 
 Around 250 PG seats have been increased due to the changed professor/student ratio from 1:2 to 1:3 as well. This apart, Diplomate in   ( ) courses for PG students have been started in district hospitals.
 
 Explaining the larger plan to bolster rural healthcare system, Minister for Health and family welfare, Dr C   said the government is also filling up existing vacancies and creating 5,000 new regularized posts for doctors. “A notification has already been issued. Also, posts for regular senior residents in medical colleges, has been created as per norms of Medical Council of India. All these measures will raise availability of doctors in tribal, rural as well as other government hospitals. There is no specific need for making the service compulsory,” he said.
