NEW DELHI: A couple of days before Dr   was shot at by gunmen early on Sunday morning, the Delhi high court had allowed his plea to be heard in a case of land dispute between his brother and another person. 

 Nagar was shot at four times by armed assailants in his farmhouse. Despite several rounds of cross firing, the orthopaedic surgeon miraculously survived, and the police investigation is on.
 
  TOI has learned that two days before the attack, Nagar successfully got "impleaded" as a party to a petition, filed by his estranged brother John Nagar, which is pending in HC. 
 
 Justice Anu Malhotra had allowed the surgeon's application, opposing any relief to his brother in the criminal case that relates to sale of farm land in Mehrauli. The plea came at a time when John was in the process of reaching a settlement with the complainant in the case who had lodged an FIR with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) against him, accusing him of cheating.
 
  in his plea argued that he is the actual owner of the property and his brother John could not have reached a settlement or even entered into a sale agreement. He also informed the court that the farm house, over which John committed himself in a sale purchase deal, was never in the accused person's possession, and it is he who has possession and control over the property.
 
 The police is already investigating property dispute between the brothers as one reason for the attack and is likely to examine if the HC proceedings of April 26th may have acted as a trigger.
 
 On behalf of the police, additional public prosecutor   had opposed John Nagar's plea to quash the FIR, pointing out that investigations revealed "incriminating findings" against John, including how he deliberately hid actual status of the property which is enmeshed in litigation.
