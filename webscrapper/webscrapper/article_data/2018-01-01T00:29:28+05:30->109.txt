Coimbatore: Following the arrest of eight ATM burglars, the city police have asked the employers in various sectors in the city to submit details about non-Tamil employees at the local police stations. Police commissioner K Periaiah said he had requested the employers in sectors such as textile, construction, hotels, gold smithery and education, to provide details, including photographs, copy of Aadhaar card, present address and also details of agents, who brought them to Coimbatore for work. “There are many migrant labourers in the city. Whenever new employees from other states join for work in any industry here, their details should be given to the respective police station immediately,” he said. The commissioner said the details would help police to maintain a record about migrant workers. “We are also going to fix CCTV cameras at the checkposts around the city to monitor vehicle movement, which will help us crack crimes,” said Periaiah. In 2016, police had launched a drive to collect details of those staying on rent to prepare a database. But, the process was discontinued later. Last year, when IS suspect Mohammed Masiruddin alias Mosa alias Manju was arrested in Kolkatta, police came to know that he had stayed with his family at Andipalayam in Tirupur for six years. Maoist leader Roopesh and his wife Shyna were staying in a rented house in Tirupur for more than one year. TNN
