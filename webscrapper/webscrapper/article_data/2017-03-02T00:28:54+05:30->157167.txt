Actor-turned   minister Bratya Basu has criticised the Central Board of Film Certification ( )'s decision of denying certificate to Hindi film "Lipstick Under My Burkha", saying its job is to certify films not censor them. 

 The release of Prakash Jha's upcoming production, starring   and  , has hit a roadblock after the censor board refused to certify the film. 
 
 Reacting on it, Bratya told , "Censor Board's job is to certify a film, not to pass verdict." 
 
 He added that if this trend continued, in future filmmakers would stop going to CBFC and solely use the medium of Netflix and   to release their movies. 
 
 Bratya, who has played a pivotal role in ace film maker Suman Mukhopadhyay's upcoming film "Asamapto" (Incomplete), also criticised the BJP government at the Centre saying it has created an era of intolerance. 
 
 "I think an era of intolerance has been created which is alarming for the nation. I think BJP has adopted a dangerous agenda - to mix communalism with development," Bratya, who has been in films of different genres like "Ichhe", "Parapar" and "Double Feluda", said. 
 
 Suman added, "We are certainly witnessing a spurt in fascist thinking in the whole country." 
 
 On the Censor Board's objection to "Lipstick Under My Burkha", Suman said the reason cited by CBFC of the movie being a lady-oriented film is "rubbish and outrageous". 
 
 Bratya been a minister since 2011. When asked if ministerial responsibilities come in the way of his career as an actor and a theatre personality, Bratya said, "My dual role as an actor and people's representative (MLA) walk hand in hand, side by side. 
 
 "Of course I don't know when the two roles will be facing each other, pitted against each other. I don't know if ever that happens what will be my response. In fact I work as an artiste for myself and as a politician for the masses who have elected me," Bratya said. SUS KK JCH
