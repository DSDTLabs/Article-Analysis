 has been wooing fans the world over with his performance in '
 ', and it now looks like the Badshah has also found a fan in Bollywood legend  . The superstar took to his social networking handle to send out a congratulatory message to SRK, praising him for his role of a bootlegger. Amitabh said, 'Congratulations Shah Rukh'  ' Loved your anger in it!!'

  
  
 It wasn't long before Shah Rukh took note of Amitabh's message. The humbled star replied saying, 'Aap se hi seekha hai sir (Learnt it from you, sir).'
 
  
  
 While praises have been pouring in for Shah Rukh from all quarters, we are certain that this message from the 'Angry Young Man' of Bollywood - Amitabh Bachchan, is held in the highest regard. Amitabh had earned this title back in the day for breaking away from the trend of romantic films and taking on powerful roles in films like 'Zanjeer', 'Deewar', 'Don', 'Agneepat' and 'Kaalia' to name a few.
 
 The two stars continued their conversation with Shah Rukh revealing that he seeks inspiration from Big B when playing "drunk, angry, powerful, comic or swaggy" roles.
