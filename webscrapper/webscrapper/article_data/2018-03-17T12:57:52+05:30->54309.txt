MUMBAI: Five days after an 18-year-old girl was   in a second class ladies coach of a local at Santacruz station, cops have found   grabs of the culprit. Cops will scan their files of habitual offenders to find a match as his facial features are not very clear. The grabs also show a Home Guard in an adjacent compartment rush in to try and nab the robber. 

 Miloni Parekh (18), a fashion designing student, was travelling from Kandivali to Grant Road with her mother on March 10. The   was about to leave Santacruz when a man in a white shirt entered around 10.30pm. The man lunged at Miloni, who was seated with her back to the door, and tried to snatch her phone. When Miloni held on to it, he dragged her from her seat as he moved to the other exit of the coach. He kept hitting her hand as other passengers raised an alarm and her mother pulled the alarm chain. As Miloni let go of the handset, the robber quickly jumped onto the tracks. 
 
 “CCTV grabs show commuters on the platform rushing towards the coach on hearing the women scream for help. A Home Guard wearing a reflective jacket got off the adjacent first class compartment and entered the second class compartment to nab the robber. From quizzing the Home Guard we found that the robber jumped off the other exit onto the tracks, crossed them and climbed up the next platform. Before the Home Guard could follow him, a train arrived on the next platform. The robber vanished by the time the train left,” a senior police official said. 
 
 “I don’t remember the robber’s facial features very clearly as everything was over in seconds. I gave his description to cops and they have called me to the police station to check CCTV footage,” said Miloni, who hoped the culprit would be brought to book soon.
