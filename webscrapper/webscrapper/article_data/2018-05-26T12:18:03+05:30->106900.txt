  Anushka played the role of IAS Chanchala, a woman who’s wrongly imprisoned for a crime she didn’t commit. She is shifted to a haunted house called the   bungalow while she's being interrogated by law enforcement officers, who are investigating corruption charges on a politician. However, as the law enforcement keeps coming closer to nabbing the corrupt politician, the events at the bungalow too keep reaching a crescendo, with Chanchala seemingly possessed.
