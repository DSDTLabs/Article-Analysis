Surat: Gujarat Adivasi Hitrakshak Samiti (GAHS), a group of tribals, have demanded implementation of Panchayats Extension to Schedule Areas (PESA) Act in tribal areas. GAHS also claimed that instead of implementation of PESA, the ruling BJP is cheating tribals by holding Adivasi Vikas Gaurav Yatra.

 “At the start of the yatra chief minister Vijay Rupani talked of PESA. But the point is why they did not implement 20 years ago. PESA Act had come into force in 1996 but the state government never implemented it,” claimed Jagatsinh Vasava, president of GAHS
 
 GAHS also warned government of stalling the yatra in the tribal areas. The organisation has filed two PILs in the high court in 2016 against government for not implementing the PESA Act.
 
 “We had approached the high court last year and the government is yet to file their reply in court. On the other hand, they (government) are taking out the yatra instead of doing concrete work for tribals. Through such events the government and BJP want to fool tribal people,” added Vasava.
 
 “GAHS had asked government in 2013 to ensure that the scheduled areas be earmarked in 32 tribal talukas where gram sabha is the supreme authority. No mining or any land ownership transfer can take place without approval of gram sabha,” added Vasava.
 
 GAHS also demanded that tribals be given rights to sell forest produce. “Currently, forest department is doing it but as per the PESA Act tribals have the right to sell forest produce,” Vasava said.
