MUMBAI: Residents who have carried out illegal alterations to increase their flat size can now look forward to the extensions being regularised. Even builders who have added illegal floors will be able to get the additions regularised. 

 In the space starved Mumbai, it is a regular practice for occupants of both residential and commercial areas to enclose flower beds, niches, drying areas, toilet ducts.
 
 The Development Plan-2034 offers additional   through payment of premium by considering the development potential of the entire plot. Earlier, the compulsory open space area was not considered for FSI. Also, FSI available in the form of Transfer of Development Rights depending on the road width etc can now be used for regularisation in existing buildings.
 
 Architect   said there are several buildings that have been denied Occupation Certificate as the FSI consumed is more than the fungible FSI. "These new forms of FSI will help cover these irregularities on payment to the  ," he said. Another benefit that will accrue to residents is that they will no longer need to pay double the taxes on these "encroached" areas.
 
 This policy of regularizing illegal floors and allowing ongoing or incomplete projects to avail of benefits under the new DP is being termed as the transit policy. Senior officials said it would help reduce corruption as civic engineers are often accused of demanding bribes from developers after first threatening to act against such constructions.
