MADURAI: Two phone calls warning of bombs set to go off — one on the   bridge and another at Apollo Specialty Hospitals in Madurai city — kept the cops and other officials on their toes on Saturday. Both were found to have been hoax calls but not before hours were spent looking for the explosive. 

 According to the police, a call was received by the Chennai police control room around 9.30 am saying that a bomb would go off on Pamban bridge, which connects   with the mainland in Ramanthapuram district. The information was immediately passed on to the Ramanathapuram police and bomb detection and disposal squads (BDDS) were sent to the bridge. Railway protection force personnel started searching the railway line. While traffic movement was not stopped, train services were temporarily suspended. The Tiruchy- Rameswaram passenger express was stopped at Mandapam station for about two hours and it was allowed to pass only after the police announced that the call was a hoax. 
 
 Meanwhile, the address of the caller was traced and the local police inspector was dispatched. Inquiries revealed that a sixth standard student was behind the hoax call. Both the father and the boy were terrified by the police inquiry and they tendered an apology. Ramanathapuram police preferred not to register a case considering the age of the boy and the fact that there was no ulterior motive behind the call. The father of the boy, hailing from   in Namakkal district, also gave an apology to the police officers. 
 
 In the second incident, a bomb threat was received by Apollo Specialty Hospitals in Madurai from an unidentified woman caller. She told the hospital workers on the Emergency Ambulance number that a bomb would go off soon, and hung up.
