BAREILLY: The additional district and session court of  , on Friday, awarded a woman Lajjavati and her brother-in-law Atar Singh life imprisonment having found them guilty in a matter of honour killing of her daughter Shivani (20).
  
  Lajjavati’s husband   had lodged an FIR against his wife, brother and father for killing his daughter. The two guilty persons were also levied fines of Rs 15,000 each.
  
  Additional district government counsel (ADGC),   said, “All the witnesses had turned hostile, but we produced irrefutable evidence before the court resulting in a guilty verdict.” 
  
  “On December 5, 2016, headman of   village,  , spotted a body that had been placed on a heap of cowdung cakes and set on fire. He immediately informed police. Before police arrived, he doused the fire with the help of villagers. Around 50 per cent of the body had turned into ashes. Police sent the body for post-mortem examination,” Rathore said.
  
  Four days after the body was found, one Devraj Singh approached police claiming that it was his daughter’s body. He asked police to hand over to him the mortal remains for her funeral.
  
  “In his police complaint, Devraj alleged that his wife, brother and father killed his daughter while he was in Kashipur. He came to know of the crime on arriving home four days later. Police then booked and arrested Lajjavati, Atar Singh and the latter’s father Udal Singh,” Rathore added.
  
  “The family had a problem with Shivani’s relationship with a man in the village, and because she was associating with other youths from the village. The family thought this was harming their reputation. After several warnings to her, they murdered her and burnt the body,” Rathore said.
