KOLKATA: To increase   of   (CBFC), Union I&B minister M   has launched an online certification system for films called ‘e-cinepramaan’. However, directors and producers will now need Aadhaar cards to apply for online certifications that should begin from the first week of April.

 Ajoy Mahmia, regional officer, CBFC Kolkata, said, “Except for Assam, Aadhaar link is mandatory for all. Since the interactive system will be operating on submission of One Time Pin (OTP), the Aadhaar link has been made the best platform. The Aadhaar-link telephone will be receiving the OTPs from the CBFC to complete the application forms. Earlier on, PAN card numbers were mandatory for hard-copy submission.”
 
 CBFC is gearing up to start the process. In-house preparations of training CBFC staff through practical workshops have begun. “The first workshop was held in Mumbai. Last month, another workshop was held in Kolkata for all CBFC officers and staff members of northeast, Kolkata and Odisha. We now need to educate the producers. They will have to create an ID and password,” Mahmia added.
 
 On Monday, CBFC, Kolkata, received two applications in hard-copies. From Tuesday, no hard-copy application is being accepted. 
 
 “By the first week of April, the online platform will be fully activated. All applications will then be received online,” a source said.
