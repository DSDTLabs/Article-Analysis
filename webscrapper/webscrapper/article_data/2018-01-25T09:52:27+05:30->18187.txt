HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Wednesday gave four months to   to set up the  

 and district-level Police Complaints Authority at all districts.
 
 The Bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice M Ganga Rao said this while hearing an appeal filed by the state. The state said that it felt aggrieved by the order of a single judge directing it to set these up and had filed a contempt case against its home secretary for not complying with the order.
 
 AP’s home department counsel told the bench that the single judge order spoke about the composition of these panels in detail.
 
 “Prakash Singh case judgment did not deal with them so elaborately,” he said, and added that a contempt case too was initiated against the state home secretary. The Bench gave time to AP to form the mechanism aimed at looking into complaints against police.
