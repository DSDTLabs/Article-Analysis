As a result,   Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat a few days ago wrote to   (FRRO), Hyderabad, to   the Nigerian, who was caught residing in the city illegally. 
 
 Nigerian Samuel King was arrested by Special Operation Team (SOT), Rachakonda, for the debit/credit card fraud while his compatriot Kolawole Olanrewaju Abiodun was recommended to be deported to Nigeria. FRRO officials reportedly have written a letter to the Nigerian embassy to make arrangements for the return of Kolawole to his country. As of know, he is in jail.
 
 “This is the first case in Rachakonda commissionerate where it has been recommended that a foreign national be deported back to his country for illegal stay. In cases where a person faces criminal charges, such persons will be tried in our local district court and then they have to undergo imprisonment if convicted. But in case of over staying or illegal staying, we will recommend immediate deportation,’’ Commissioner Bhagwat said. 
 
 Officials said that once the accused undergo trial and subsequently punishment, they too will be deported automatically.
