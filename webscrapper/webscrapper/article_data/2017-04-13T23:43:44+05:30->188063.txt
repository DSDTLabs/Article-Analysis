Gandhinagar: Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday announced a key change in the ‘Rooftop Solar Project Policy for Homes’ — the condition that the solar plant’s capacity should be within 50% of the sanctioned load has been removed.

 He announced the relaxation to resolve difficulties faced by people in optimum utilization of their rooftop solar power plants. People with even low sanctioned load can now go for maximum utilization of capacity.
 
 Gujarat had announced the rooftop solar plant policy in late 2015. The latest relaxation will provide economic benefit not only to ordinary people but also to the state’s economy by harnessing a greater quantum of renewable energy and protecting the environment at the same time. However, there will not be any change in the government’s subsidy scheme of Rs10,000 per kW up to a maximum of 2kW. tnn
