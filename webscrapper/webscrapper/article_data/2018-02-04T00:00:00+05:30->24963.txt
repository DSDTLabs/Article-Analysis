Actor   had last done a Malayalam film in 2015, the award-winning movie Ben. However he’s keeping himself busy in other film industries and has just completed Tamil movie, directed by Maran.

 The action thriller titled   has him sharing screen with M Karunanidhi’s grandson and Vamsam fame actor   Tamilarasu.
 On his character, Ajmal says, “I play Gautham, a stylish guy who is crazy about bikes and cars. He is a fraudster, who wouldn’t even hesitate to kill people for money. At the same time, this is a film in which all the main characters have shades of grey.”
 Ajmal says that that working in the film was a “thrilling experience” in itself as there is a game created in the plot through the unpredictability of the characters.
 
 “Gautham isn’t an everyday guy and to portray his personality bringing in the right elements at each juncture was quite a challenge for me. I enjoyed doing that,” says the actor, whose previous release was Swathi Kolai Vazhakku in 2017.
 Arulnithi plays a call taxi driver in the film, which also has Mahima Nambiar and Vidya Pradeep as the female leads.
