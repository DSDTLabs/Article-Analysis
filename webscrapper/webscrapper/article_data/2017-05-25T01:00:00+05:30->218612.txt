In an unexpected turn of events, Shashank Vyas’ journey in ' ' — he plays Ravish — has been cut short abruptly. Incidentally, his entry in the show was delayed by eight months. And now, a year later, it has been decided — overnight apparently — to wind up his track.

 Informs a source associated with the show, “Shashank will exit the show by the end of this month. It has not been smooth sailing for him ever since he joined the project. His apprehensions about his role didn’t go down well with the makers. At one point, Shashank wanted to quit, but the differences were resolved and he decided to continue. However, he recently expressed his displeasure over his track once again, which may have infuriated the makers further.”
 
 Shashank says, “I was informed about my track ending. I played the character with utmost sincerity. I have nothing more to say.”
 
 Dismissing rumours of a rift with Shashank, and giving details about the track ending abruptly, producer   says, “The closure of Ravish’s track was discussed at length three weeks in advance. Shashank was informed about the same two weeks ago. So, how can it be overnight? There has never been any conflict or disagreement between us. Shashank is a talented and thinking actor. All his queries have been addressed. His track is ending because we have exhausted every possible angle.”
