MUMBAI: The drive from S V Road, Andheri to   (WEH) is all set to get shorter in a month, motorists will be able to breeze through the distance in five minutes. 

 Currently, travellers take more than 20 minutes to trudge through the traffic-logged stretch. 
 
 The  's K East ward is working on laying a road, which was proposed in the Development Plan (DP) 1969 from the   subway on SV Road to the highway. Officials said the motorway is likely to reduce travel time considerably for motorists, who currently need to use the congested   to reach the highway from SV Road. Since the widened road will not have any traffic lights, motorists will be able to have a smooth journey. 
 
 "Currently, on the stretch between S V Road, Andheri to Western Express Highway, there is an 8ft-wide road, which was heavily encroached," said a senior civic official. 
 
  The new road will start from SV Road (Andheri east subway) pass through Nicholas Wadi and then touch the   subway in Jogeshwari on the highway. The new motorway will to prove be a boon for those living in the western suburbs where traffic congestion has become a problem. Motorists said that with the Metro work in progress, traffic snarls have increased. 
 
 Activist Godfrey Pimenta said that the new road will ease traffic flow. "The new connector straight to WEH will solve our woes," he said. 
 
 However, officials said some sections are opposed to the project.
