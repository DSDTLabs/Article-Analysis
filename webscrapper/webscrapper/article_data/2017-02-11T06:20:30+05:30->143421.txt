AHMEDABAD: Justice RM Chhaya of Gujarat high court on Friday issued notice to the state government, the Centre and the   & Rehabilitation Board, after a victim of acid attack complained of inappropriate medical treatment and demanded compensation from the government.

 Twenty-five-year-old petitioner from Naroda area, Dimple Soni, has sought that the high court issue directions to the state authorties to pay her Rs 14 lakh for medical treatment and compensation for the torture she was put to by her in-laws. 
 
 Her advocate, NM Kapadia, cited the government’s policy for treatment and compensation for acid attack victims following a Supreme Court’s order. The victim has also requested proper treatment by a panel of doctors, and free medicines. According to the petition, Dimple was married to one Sunil Soni of Alvar in Rajasthan in June 2011. Since the beginning of her marriage, her in-laws were pressurizing her to bring dowry and began torturing her. On August 13, 2012, she was severely beaten and forced to consume acid by her husband and in-laws. They left her to die as her condition deteriorated. The neighbours rushed her to hospital in Alvar. From here, she was shifted to Jaipur and later to Ahmedabad. The petitioner has complained that she was hospitalized in   at Ahmedabad but expressed dissatisfaction with the kind of treatment she got. She has claimed that only general treatment was given to her but she now requires plastic surgery and the latest treatment to restore her to what she was earlier.
 
 The court has kept further hearing on her petition on March 3.
