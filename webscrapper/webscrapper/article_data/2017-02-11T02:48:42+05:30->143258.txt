NEW DELHI: In a major   to the residents of  , the Delhi Development Authority ( ) has decided to revise the   date for identification of beneficiaries of the redevelopment project. 

 The decision was taken on Friday at DDA’s monthly meeting, which was chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. The decision was taken following growing demand from slum dwellers who have been refusing to shift to the transit camp on temporary basis. 
 
 Following Supreme Court orders, DDA had started demolition drive in   Colony in December last year. It has been asking people to voluntarily shift to the camp, so that redevelopment work can start. But cut-off date of January 31, 2011, was the main hurdle in the eviction and demolition drive, as locals want all residents to benefit from the scheme.
 
 Locals had demanded that the authority should follow the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board’s (DUSIB) guidelines under which the cut-off date was revised to January 1, 2015. “The cut-off date has been finally revised as per the DUSIB policy. Now, people having relevant documents till the new cut-off date will be eligible under the scheme,” said JP Aggarwal, principal commissioner, land disposal and housing, DDA. 
 
 According to the last survey conducted as per the January 2011 cut-off, there were 2,641 families eligible for rehabilitation. But the land-owning agency is carrying out a fresh survey to identify new families which will be eligible now.
 
 “Appropriate action to rehabilitate the additional number of slum dwellers will be taken by DDA. We will work out a policy in this regard,” said Aggarwal.
 
 So far, 1,230 families have been shifted to the transit camp. Officials said that the eviction process will be completed in the next two months. They said that as per a rough estimate there would be close to 400 new families, which have to be added to the existing list.
