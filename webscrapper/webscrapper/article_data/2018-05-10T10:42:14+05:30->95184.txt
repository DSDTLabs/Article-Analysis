BENGALURU: A sea of humanity flooded the streets of Bengaluru on Wednesday with All India   Committee (AICC) president   Gandhi holding roadshows in different areas of the city.

 
 Rahul started his roadshow after visiting   Ganapathi Temple in Basavangudi where he offered prayers. Commotion prevailed for some time at the temple entrance as the public and mediapersons thronged to catch a glimpse of the Gandhi scion, pushing security personnel and breaking the metal detectors in the melee.
 
 Rahul chose to travel in a min-van (tempo-traveller) joined by other senior leaders Ashok Gehlot and K C Venugopal. Rahul also kept disciplining party men to ensure traffic is not disrupted for long. At one point of time, he also asked them to move the caravan aside as he heard the siren of an ambulance.
 
 Addressing corner meetings at various places, Rahul said the Congress will return to power in the state and claimed the early momentum gained by them had made BJP and Prime Minister   jittery.
 
 The police had diverted traffic at various places leading to slow moving traffic on all major roads in the Central Business District (CBD).
 
 A college student managed to click a selfie with Rahul. The teenager managed to reach him in what appeared to be a breach of security protocol. Rahul ended the daylong roadshow by addressing a mini-public rally at Hebbal.
