DALLAS: Taking a break from the escalating pressures of the   probe and the Stormy Daniels case, President   returned to his supporters at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention on Friday and called the   a “truly great organisation that loves this country”.

 
 His remark came after he temporarily strayed from their strong anti-gun control message in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida — only to later return to the fold.
 
 Trump defended American gun laws by contrasting them with London’s stringent antigun legislation, claiming it resulted in one of the British capital’s hospitals turning into a “war zone” due to a rise in knife crime instead. Trump, who is due to visit UK, also sarcastically questioned whether vans, trucks and cars, which have been used as weapons by terrorists, should also be banned before turning to knives.
 
 Trump’s attendance at this year’s NRA convention was announced just days ago. Trump has long enjoyed strong backing from the NRA, which spent about $30 million in support of his presidential campaign.
