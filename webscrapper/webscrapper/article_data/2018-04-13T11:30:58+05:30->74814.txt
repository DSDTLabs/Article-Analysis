Actor  , who shot to fame with movie   as  , was recently in Lucknow to attend a children’s film festival organised by a private school. The actress had faint memories of coming to Lucknow more than a decade ago. "I was last here to visit my relatives who used to stay in Lucknow. However, the city has changed drastically over these 10 years, especially in terms of cleanliness. Lucknow is so clean now! While on my way from the airport, I saw these huge parks too, and even from outside, they looked so clean. Being a constant traveller to Delhi and Mumbai, while Delhi is insanely polluted, Mumbai is full of traffic. Thankfully I didn’t encounter any of the two things here in Lucknow."
Even though Sonal didn’t have much time at hand, she had a long list of things to do in Lucknow. "I am really excited to go shopping in Lucknow. Since the city is known for chikan work, I need to buy that for my entire family. Apart from my mother and sister, six of my best friends too have asked me to get chikan kurtis and suits for them!" said Sonal, who has also acted in television shows   and  . 
 A theatre artist and a script writer as well, Sonal misses being on stage in front of live audience. "Theatre is and will always remain my first love. I think it somehow enhances an actor’s personality and brings out the real you. I used to do a lot of plays but once you start working in front of the camera it is difficult to take time out for theatre," says Sonal, who is presently writing scripts for plays.
