Nagpur: A 32-year-old geologist has been duped of Rs3.56 lakh by a gang of three, including two British citizens, between December 10 and December 15, 2017. Priti Chute, a junior geologist at Directorate of Geology and Mining (DGM), was duped by telling her to pay customs duty for a gift she was sent from the United Kingdom (UK).   Priti had registered her name on a matrimonial site, and received a request from UK citizen Roger Williams. The man claimed to be single and also showed interest in meeting Priti. Both of them started chatting through emails, soon their friendship bloomed, and they also exchanged mobile numbers. After some days, Williamâ€™s sister VilliNine called Priti and informed her that she is sending her a gift through courier.    Both Priti and Williams continued chatting through WhatsApp. A couple of days later, Priti received a call from a person named Rajiv Kumar, who claimed to be calling from New Delhi customs office. Kumar told Priti that a parcel has arrived for her, but to claim it she would have to deposit some money. Kumar then provided her an account number of a nationalized bank, following which the geologist made several payments in the account.    Since then, the complainant has not received any gift, and phone numbers of all three persons, including both British citizens, are out of reach. Cops suspect an organized racket of a UK-based gang. According to the cops, the names used by the tricksters may not be their real name. It is possible that the trio has targeted other unmarried women too and duped them.    Police sources claimed that the bank account number and mobile number have been tracked to Delhi and Assam, while the number of the British citizens had UK country code. Sakkardara police have currently registered a case of fraud and dishonesty against the trio.
