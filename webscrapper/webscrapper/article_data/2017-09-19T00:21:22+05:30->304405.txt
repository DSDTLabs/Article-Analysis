Chandigarh: Mann Kaur, the 101-year-old sprinter from Chandigarh, is one of the contenders for this year’s prestigious Laureus Sports Awards. She has been nominated in the best sporting moment of the year category. The organisers have kept voting for this category. The sporting moment that bags the most number of votes will get the award.

 TOI had reported on September 8 how Kaur’s son Gurdev Singh is seeking votes for her mother. At that point, Mann Kaur had a vote share of nearly 10% of the total votes. Ten days down the line, the voting share of Kaur has jumped to 20% with a huge number of people from Chandigarh and the Tricity having casted their vote in the online poll. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Gurdev Singh, “The response has been terrific. It just shows the love that people have for my mother. I would like to thank all those who have voted and supported us.”
 
 Gurdev, however, voiced his concern about the entire voting procedure. “If you go to the link, you will see that it asks you if you want to log in through your Facebook account or through your e-mail. If you cast your vote by logging in your Facebook account, it will immediately register your vote but if you take the other option, a screen pops up and asks stupid questions and the procedure confuses people. “There have been many people calling me up and asking me how to go about it. Not everyone has a Facebook account and they find it very difficult to cast their vote. One vote less can cost us dear,” he said. 
 
 Saaniya Sharma, a golfer from Chandigarh, said, “I have given my vote to Mann Kaur. She is such an inspiration and she has put India on the map. She made the nation proud by winning gold at the World Masters Games at an age of 101, and according to me she deserves to win this award.”
 
 Kaur will now compete in Asia Masters Athletics Championship at Rugao in China, later this month.
