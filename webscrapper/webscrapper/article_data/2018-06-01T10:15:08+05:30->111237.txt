JAIPUR: In a matter related to education qualification required for signing laboratory reports, the   issued interim order directing the Centre to furnish reason why minimum qualification has not been prescribed for basic laboratories. 

 
 The High Court's double bench of chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Dinesh Chandra Somani has mentioned in the interim order that  , who represented the Central government would obtain instructions from the Centre as to what was the reason as to why the minimum qualifications were not prescribed for the basic laboratories in the notification issued by the Centre on May 18.
 
 These rules were notified last week by the Ministry of Health Welfare, Government of India with a view to prescribe minimum standards of facilities and services for Medical diagnostic (pathology) laboratories.
 
 As per the Centre's notification, pathological analysis has been put in three categories: Basic, medium and advanced. Under caption 'medium' and 'Advanced' the essential qualifications are prescribed being a post graduate in pathology or biochemistry or medical biology. But, under the caption 'Basic' no minimum education qualification is prescribed. The description is to the effect that a pathology degree in medicine or surgery from a recognised university is desirable.The notification does not prescribe the minimum qualification, the High Court observed. 
 
 "The rules (notification May 18) are against the recommendations passed by the expert subcommittee on 8 March earlier this year, The Indian Medical Council Act and the   order dated December 12, 2017, which say that only a postgraduate in pathology registered with MCI can sign/countersign a laboratory report," said Dr  , secretary Practicing Pathologists Society. tnn
