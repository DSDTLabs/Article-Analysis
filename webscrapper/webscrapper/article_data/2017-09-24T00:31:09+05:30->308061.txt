 Madurai: School students and professional artists vied each other to paint the compound walls of the Madurai railway junction in TB Road, which belong to the corporation. They painted beautiful art forms in a hue of colours for the competition conducted as a part of Swachhta hi Sewa programme.
 
 The   administration has intensified cleaning operations and is also conducting many competitions to promote the cleanliness drive in the district. Painting walls is expected to discourage people from urinating on them and also littering the areas near them. While profession artists drew tourist attractions such as Meenakshi Amman temple, Thirumalai Naicker Mahal among others, students came up with more innovative ideas like how Madurai would look if it was clean and neat.
 
 The paintings highlighted the cleaning works conducted in the city and also depicted Vaigai flowing with clear water. “This is how Madurai would be if we took efforts to keep it clean and it is not something that is impossible to achieve,” said the students. About 15 artists and 10 students participated in the first day effort. The corporation provided them with all the requirements including paint and brushes.
 
 As the public showed enthusiasm to make the city clean and also paint the walls, the competition has been extended till September 28. Those wishing to participate can do so by calling the number 9994393503 and registering their name. The paintings should be based on the theme of cleanliness and the best ones would be given awards.
 
 Collector in action: Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao inspected the cleaning works in Sedapatti panchayat union. Much to the surprise of many, he too picked up a cleaning tool and de-clogged a drain, impressing the villagers. Rao also ordered the shops that did not segregate their wastes properly be fined when he visited the Peraiyur town panchayat and inspected the cleaning works.
