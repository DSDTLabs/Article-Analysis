NASHIK: Representatives of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India ( ) and architects’ association met municipal commissioner   and joint director of town planning   on Monday to discuss their grievances against some of the rules in the recently released development plan (DP) and development control rules (DCR).

 Their suggestions and objections will be submitted to the government by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). On April 30, 2015, the state government came up with a notification on uniform   (transfer of development rights) policy, but as per the new rules of the civic body, TDR holders will face losses in some places.
 
 Bhadane said the TDR will be awarded as per the terms and conditions in the contract. But Krishna made it clear that TDR will not be awarded where DP roads merge with internal roads, if TDR is loaded on the plot then the remaining TDR will not be awarded.
 
 Various aspects of the no objection certificates (NOC) from the fire department like Maharashtra Fire Act, National Building Code, new and old development rules were also discussed. “It is not necessary to take an   from the fire department for residential buildings up to 24 meter height,” said Krishna.
 
 Fire safety measures need to be installed for buildings that are between 15 and 24 meter. However, NOC will have to be taken for structures above 24 metre height and special buildings.
 
 Cupboard space issue was also discussed in the meeting. Additional floor space index (FSI) has been approved for all roads in the new development rules and five per cent additional balcony space has also been approved. Based on this rule, developers asked for respite from cupboard space violations.
