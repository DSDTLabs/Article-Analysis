Bollywood has captured the various moods, colours and shades of Holi through its many song and dance sequences over the years. Some of these have gained immense popularity with their ability in capturing the spirit of the festival. Impressive picturisation, apt choreography and a touch of folk element have also played a major role in generating mass appeal for these songs.
