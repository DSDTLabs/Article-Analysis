AHMEDABAD: All admissions to   done in the   across the state were cancelled on Wednesday by the   for   due to a major  . Two extra admissions were made in the radiology branch at BJ Medical College, against the number of seats available. There was chaos in the admission committee after the incident and the blame game began.

 Students had already reported to the institutes where they were allotted admission by the time they were informed that the admissions had been cancelled. Students were informed, via SMS, about the cancellation and that the new schedule for the next round of admissions would be announced by the weekend.
 
 This is the first time that the admission procedure for postgraduate medical courses were done online. Admissions for all colleges in the state were carried out simultaneously. The second round of admissions began on Tuesday, with some 1,400 students called for the admission procedure. Admissions were carried out for 574 seats in the second round. Some 49 fresh admissions were done while 400 students had opted for a change in branch.
 
 Admission committee members are still figuring out how the goof-up happened. Lakhs were spent on the software, however, it appears that there was no mechanism to tally the admissions done against the number of seats.
 
 J P Gupta, health commissioner, said, “We noticed an error in allocation of seats, the error is being rectified by the department. The process will be re-done after rectifying the error and to ensure that no students face injustice.”
