THANE: The key accused in the army recruitment  ,  , a clerk in Nagpur, had sourced the copies from the electronic cyclostyling machine where it was sent to make copies, said the police. A cyclostyle machine is a copying mechanism, quite like a photocopier. The police also said that a search of the bank locker of the other accused,  , had unearthed Rs 21lakh and gold worth Rs 10 lakh.

 A senior police officer told TOI that the exam paper leaked from different parts of Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra. The officer said that a CD of the exam papers is sent to officers in different parts under tight security. Later, each centre makes copies from cyclostyle machines.
 
 The officer said that Ravikumar was well versed with the official work at the time of exam. An officer said that he used to pull out a copy discarded as waste due to bad print quality or one which was stuck in the machine.
 
 Ravikumar has told the police that he had taken care to shut down CCTVs in the office to avoid getting caught, said an officer. “At times, he used to take away an exam paper, photograph it and later circulate it through WhatsApp,“ the officer said, adding that they are verifying his claims.
 
 In a related development, a team investigating the money trail of the other accused, Santosh Shinde, the proprietor of an army coaching institute, has found Rs 21 lakh in his locker of a private bank in Phaltan. Besides, gold worth Rs 10 lakh has also been unearthed from the locker, said the officer.
 
 Earlier, the police had found Rs 10 lakh transactions made in Shinde's bank account. “This shows that Shinde earned a lot of money through this dark trade. They could have taken different and higher amounts from different students. The money trail is under the scanner and could also be linked to the other accused in this case,“ said the officer.
 
 DCP (crime), Parag Manere, said that two police teams have already left for Pune and Nagpur to get more evidence in the case.
