MANALI: Life in Kullu has remained out of gear since Friday as authorities have failed to tackle 30 to 90 cm of snow due to lack of technical equipment, machinery and action plan.

 While the PWD could not buy a snow cutter machine to keep Manali villages connected at all times, a mini snow cutter bought last year has proved to be inept. The department is now clearing snow with JCB machines, which also damage roads. Even cops lack quality warm shoes and uniform and finf it difficult to carry out search and rescue operations.
 
 Strangley, even government officials, including sub-divisional magistrate, do not have four-wheel-drive vehicles for snow. There is one such vehicle with the police department, but it is not enough to cover the entire area in time of emergency.
 
 Blaming the government for the state of affairs, Himachal BJP spokesperson and Manali MLA   said, “The first spell of snowfall in the district has exposed the government’s preparations for disaster management. It was villagers who helped stranded people but government had no action plan to deal with the situation. We are asking for a snow cutter machine but PWD has failed to procure one.” he said.
