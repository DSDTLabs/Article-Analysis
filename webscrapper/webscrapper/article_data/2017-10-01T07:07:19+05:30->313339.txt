BENGALURU: Bengaluru city, which was on the verge of breaking the record for wettest-ever September, fell short by just 3mm rainfall. The city recorded 513.8mm at 8.30am on Saturday, just short of the 516.6mm in September 1986.

 The Indian Meteorological Department's rainfall data going back 100 years shows that the month of August this year too missed the highest rainfall record by a narrow margin. In 1998, the rainfall was 387.1 mm while this year the rainfall fell short of the record by just 36mm.
 
 However, near record rain during August and September, after a dry spell during June and July, has taken the seasonal rainfall (June 1 to September 30) total to 949.7mm, which means the city has had a very good south-west monsoon season, said officials with the   centre here. The rain is here to stay. The Met department has predicted more showers for the coming days. A statement from the department said the city is expected to witness one or two spells of rain  ."Existing weather of generally cloudy sky will remain. Maximum and minimum temperatures are very likely to be around 26 and 20 degrees celsius," the statement said.
