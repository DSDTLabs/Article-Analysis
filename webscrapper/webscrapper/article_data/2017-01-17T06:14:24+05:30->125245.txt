CHANDIGARH: AAP on Monday accused the Congress of helping Punjab chief minister   and his son   to escape “humiliating defeat“ in Lambi and Jalalabad respectively by dividing the anti-incumbency votes.

 AAP campaign committee chairman   alleged that both SAD and the Congress were aware that AAP was going to sweep in Punjab and Badals and Captain Amarinder Singh would losing their seats with huge margins. He said Badal and Amarinder were two side of the same coin and their families always look after each other's political interests.
 
 “The Congress decision to field Amarinder against Badals and   against Sukhbir Badal is meant to create a false hype and save Badals,“ he said in the statement. Mann said despite Congress and Akali Dal “conspiracy to save senior leaders of either party“, they would be defeated.
 
 He said SAD had intentionally put a weak candidate, former Army chief General J J Singh against Amarinder in Patiala. Mann said if Amarinder was so sure and serio us to contest against Badal, he should contest only from Lambi and not from Patiala.
 
 “Choosing two seats reflects insecurity and uncertainty in the mind of Amarinder. However, AAP will ensure that Amarinder faces the same fate that of Badals.Amarinder can't change the destiny of Badal who has looted people of Punjab for 10 years and now finding shelter behind Congress party ,“ Mann quipped.
 
 On Bittu, he said he wished him good luck and he should understand that fielding him from Jalalabad might be conspiracy of Amarinder to finish the political legacy of late Punjab CM Beant Singh.
