PATIALA: Narvedinder Singh, son of   who lost his life 30 years ago in a road rage incident involving cricketer-turned politician Navjot Singh  , was present in the Supreme Court when the verdict was pronounced in the culpable homicide case against   minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. After the judgement he said he was disappointed but there was no question of losing faith in the judiciary.

 In a brief conversion with TOI over phone, Narvedinder said the family had and would continue to have full faith in the judiciary but he was disappointed by the verdict. “I had lost my father and you can imagine what a son will want in the name of justice and there is nothing wrong in it. I was very young when the incident took place and living without my father had been quite tough for me,” he said.
 
 He said he had seen politics being played over the case and had even requested the politicians not to interfere in the delivery of justice and let the courts do their job. “I always had faith in the Almighty and the judiciary and whatever decision has been pronounced has been accepted by the family as God’s will, but with a heavy heart,” he said before turning off his phone.
 
 Earlier, Narvedinder had told TOI that neither Sidhu, nor any of his associates had ever approached the family for a compromise. He said nor had the family ever spoken to the cricketer-turned-commentator-turned politicians during the 30-year long battle.
