Under the on-going culture exchange program by  , about 80 students from the North eastern states of Manipur, Sikkim,   have been mingling and learning with students of MP. On the fifth day of the program, the students were taken on a tour of   (Museum of Man) and Vidhan Sabha. When the North eastern students reached the open air habitat exhibition of Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur and   they felt right at home! Happily they clicked selfies and pictures in tribal habitats.

  
 Post the exhaustive visit of the museum, students made their way to the Vidhan Sabha where they learnt of the legislative procedures. The 10-days exchange programme is a step forward to bridge the gap between youths of the two regions culture wise. Which is why they even have cultural evenings.
