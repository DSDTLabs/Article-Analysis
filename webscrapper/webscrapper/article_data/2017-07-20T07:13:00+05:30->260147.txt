Fatehgarh Sahib: Police have arrested six persons of a gang who were allegedly involved in several cases of theft in various districts in Punjab. Police have also recovered stolen items worth Rs 20 lakh from them.

 Six accused were identified as Ram Babu of Ludhiana, Mangi Kumar of Mandi Gobindgarh, Dinesh Giri and Subhash Chand of Mandi Gobidngarh, Mohammad Ali of Ludhiana, and Jatinder Singh of Khanna of Ludhiana district.
 
 With their arrests, police claimed to have solved nine cases of theft in Patiala, Sangrur, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana and other districts, where the gang stole iron shutters, iron rods, pipes and cement bags from under-construction buildings.
 
 Police said the modus operandi of the accused was to go to buildings or sites in the night where construction was under progress and then steal cement bags, iron rods, pipes and other valuable items to further sell the same to scrap dealers. These accused allegedly used to kidnap and then strip the security guards to commit thefts.
 
 Police claimed that members of the gang basically belonged to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the past too, they had carried out several such thefts. As many as 12 cases of theft had been registered against the accused at police stations including Gobindgarh and Bassi Pathana police stations of Fatehgarh Sahib, Amargarh of Sangrur, Banga of Nawanshahr and Sahnewal of Ludhiana district.
 
 SP (detective) Daljit Singh Rana said, “Some gang members use to scan the areas in the night in their vehicles. Their team leader used to come along with his men in a pick-up van to further load the stolen material.”
