NEW DELHI: The custodian arrested for putting   in the   in   told the police that he had procured six notes — five of Rs 2,000 and one of Rs 500 — from a youth who had played a prank on local shopkeepers.

 “We have narrowed down on a few criminals suspected to having supplied the notes to the ATM custodian, Mohammad Esha. We are questioning them to get a lead on the source of the fake bills,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
 
 When Esha heard about the prank on local shopkeepers involving the notes with Children’s Bank of India logo, he contacted a youth in E-block of Sangam Vihar to give him the fakes. He got the idea of exchanging the original notes with fakes after watching a vernacular movie.
 
 Esha said that he put the Rs 500 note in an ATM in Khanpur on February 3 since it was closer to his residence and the probability of a victim registering a complaint was less. When that note was withdrawn by someone and it went undetected, he put the five Rs 2,000 notes in the Sangam Vihar ATM. The arrested man said that he had planned to procure a larger consignment of fake notes from the criminals after lying low for two days. However, the youth who had supplied him the notes disappeared from the area, he claimed. Esha was booked under the charge of cheating based on circumstantial evidence and was given bail earlier this week.
