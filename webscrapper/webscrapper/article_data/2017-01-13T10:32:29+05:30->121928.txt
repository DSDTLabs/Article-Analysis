 as promised is all about Telugu glory. And through the narrative, not once does Krish let you forget that women are the ones in power. Shriya as Vashishti Devi looked majestic yet delicate and played the role of a hurt mother impeccably. Hema Malini too was a delight to watch on screen. Although the maturity in Balayya's face helped during the high-emotion scenes, his body language wasn’t cooperating. Your love for the language will experience a boost after watching this film. It was a job well done by Sai Madhav Burra; kudos! As much as the album was a great hear, the songs don’t do much for the film. 

 
 
 This movie is a historical and it does the job of one – narrating the events. Repeat footages and weakly choreographed and costumed war sequences were a slight put off when you were riding high on the chivalry of yore. Gautamiputra Satakarni is certainly a must-watch for someone who feels strongly about the Telugu culture, language and history. And for others, it’s a story you will appreciate.
