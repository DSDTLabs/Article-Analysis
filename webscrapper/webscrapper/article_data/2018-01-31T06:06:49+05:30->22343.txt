NEW DELHI: The CBI told the   (PAC) on Tuesday that it will take a decision on whether to file a special leave petition in the   seeking to revive the probe into the   payoff case within the next few days.

 The CBI made its submission to a sub-committee of the PAC in the context of attorney general K K Venugopal advising the government that the delay of more than a decade after the deadline for appeal had lapsed sharply increased the possibility of the plea being dismissed by the SC.
 
 CBI director Alok Verma told the committee that a decision would be taken keeping in view the need to marshal convincing arguments. The agency could point out that it had been keen to appeal the Delhi High Court’s May 2005 decision to acquit the UK-based Hinduja brothers. 
 
 Department of personnel and training secretary   informed the committee that CBI was free to take a decision on whether an SLP needed to be filed in the SC or whether it would make its submissions as a respondent in a case regarding two private petitions in the SC seeking to file a criminal appeal. 
 
 Members of the sub-committee sought information on the possible appeals process, saying the CBI could well point out that it was prevented from appealing the HC decision and had strong evidence of malfeasance in the case relating to purchase of Swedish 155mm howitzers.
 
 The CBI did see the risk — as outlined by the AG — of an SLP being rejected but a member said time-bound cases could be revived if the grounds were compelling. Venugopal, in his opinion, said there was lack of evidence and circumstance that might convince the SC to waive expiry of the appeal window.
