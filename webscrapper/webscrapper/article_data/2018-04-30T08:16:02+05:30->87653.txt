MYSURU: Upset with not being paid his   for the past five months, a 28-year-old   allegedly attempted suicide here on Saturday.

 Sathyanarayana had been working in Ward No.18 for the past five months. He alleged that, while all the other pourakarmikas working for   (MCC) had received their salary, he had not been provided  .
 
 Sathyanarayana reportedly contacted his supervisor Anbu on Saturday, demanding his salary. Not convinced with his reply, Sathyanarayana allegedly consumed poison at a park close to the Ashokapuram police station. Cops spotted him at the park, and took him to KR Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.
 
 Pourakarmika leader Mara visited Sathyanarayana at KR Hospital. “Sathyanarayana has been working at Ward No. 18 for the past five months, but he was not given his salary. This is the second such incident in the past 20 days,” Mara told TOI.
 
 Mara said that, when they contacted MCC health officer Dr Ramachandra, the latter informed them that Sathyanarayana’s name was not on the civic body’s list. 
 
 Mara asked how Sathyanarayana’s supervisor had permitted him to work when his name was not on the MCC’s list. “We have requested the health officer to include Sathyanarayana on the list, and ensure he is paid salary for the past five months. I will file a police complaint, and also meet the MCC commissioner to fix the problem, besides ensuring timely disbursal of salary to all pourakarmikas. If such incidents are repeated, and pourakarmikas are not paid their salaries on time, we will not keep quiet,” Mara added.
