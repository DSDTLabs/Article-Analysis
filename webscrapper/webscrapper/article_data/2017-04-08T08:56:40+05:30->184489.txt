Dharamshala: The first national summit to fight against tuberculosis (TB) began at this hill town on Friday, with a team of actors led by   arriving here for a T20 match against the members of parliament to raise awareness about the disease. The   actors, MPs and health experts who are here plan to reach out to all so as to bring national focus on the issue and end TB in India by 2025, as aimed by the Government of India.

 The match is part of two-day event, 1st  , starting on April 7. The T20 match would be played on Saturday.
 
 “The message will reach out to every Indian due this combination (of actors and politicians) in the summit,” said Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur, who will lead MP XI. The team includes  , Nishikant Dubey, Jayant Chaudhary, Deepender Singh Hooda, Sanjay Jaiswal, Gaurav Gogoi and former MP Mohammad Azharuddin. 
 
 Speaking on the occasion, actor Bobby Deol, who is the captain for Mumbai Hero team, said TB could be checked easily by spreading awareness. Actor Suniel Shetty called for ban on spitting, saying it would eradicate 90% chances of the disease from spreading, as pointed out by experts. “The budget allocated for this campaign is Rs 2,000 crore and this time it would reach its destination,” he added.
 
 India has 18% of the world’s population but has 27% of the world’s TB patients and 34% of TB deaths in the world, said the participants in summit. Actor Sonu Sood, making his address in Punjabi language, said people are not aware of its treatment in rural areas and those who are aware usually go to private health care centres. “People should be aware that even government doctors can tackle it,” he said.
 
 While actor-director   said rather than measuring the graphs of TB patients in the country, experts should come out with precautions and measures for this. “We have come together to play cricket for a cause and precautionary measures should be told to the people,” he said.
