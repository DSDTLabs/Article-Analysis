For actress   Dutt, having a healthy skin is the best way to look fashionable. The actress believes that a healthy and glowing skin is the best accessory one could flaunt all year round. So when it comes to summer fashion, Debleena feels that more than extra clothing and accessories she would rather carry a bottle of nimbu pani in her bag. “Staying hydrated is the best fashion tip I can think of and I ask everyone to follow the same. After all, being healthy is the best way to look beautiful,” she added.
