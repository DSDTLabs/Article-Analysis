CHENNAI: Alarmed by a series of incidents in which bike-borne youths have targeted pedestrians, snatching their mobile phones and gold chains, a group of residents and civic activists from   held a meeting with senior law and order and traffic officials. 

 Residents said several neighbourhoods including   and   had been rendered unsafe, adding that many women and senior citizens are unwilling to step out because of the lack of security.
 
 "I saw two separate incidents in the past one week where pedestrians were targeted by young boys who snatched their phones and sped away," said T Sarala*, a resident of Venkatarathinam Nagar.
 
 The increasing frequency of such incidents has led residents to seek an urgent solution to the menace. 
 
 "I saw a girl crossing a traffic intersection when two boys on a bike deliberately rode in and almost hit her although they failed to snatch her valuables," said another resident. 
 
 He added that two or three boys riding a bike without helmets and audaciously targeting pedestrians was fast becoming the norm. "They are young and brazen enough to commit such acts," he said.
 
 A senior official from the traffic wing in Adyar said the incidents have been brought to their notice.
 
  "We will be looking into the complaints and taking action accordingly," he added. The residents added that they also discussed about various civic issues with the officials.
