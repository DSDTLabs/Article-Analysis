NEW DELHI: When cops busted a   of burglars in south Delhi recently, the six members led them to a ‘cave’ in Moti Bagh that they used to hide the stolen items. Police said the accused broke into houses wearing surgical hand gloves to avoid leaving their fingerprints at the crime scene. They then took the goods in bags and hid them in crude vaults constructed inside the cave.

 The men —  , Virender Gadwali, Raju, Santosh Gupta, Bablu and   — were arrested from their hideout. Laptops, Rs 50,000 cash, imported watches and cameras were found with them. “The men were arrested after a raid. Several cases of burglary reported from Vasant Kunj, RK Puram, Chanakyapuri and   have been solved with their arrests,” said additional DCP (south) Chinmoy Biswal.
 
 During interrogation, the men disclosed that they used to enter houses through windows and mainly looked for electronics and cash. Police officers said that the men were drug addicts. They also spent the stolen cash on massage parlour visits.
 
 Kuldeep said he found the 50-foot-long cave a few years back. He first used it for hiding drugs and alcohol, and later created slots in it to hide booty. Police said a probe has been started to find out if the gang hid stolen goods at other places too.
