VILA-REAL:   equalised for   as World Cup contenders   were held to a 1-1 draw at home in their final friendly before jetting out to Russia next week.

 
 Real Sociedad right-back   volleyed Spain ahead on 29 minutes in Vila-real with a fantastic strike from the edge of the area in just his third international appearance.

 AC Milan defender Rodriguez levelled for Vladimir Petkovic's Switzerland, also World Cup bound, on the hour with a tap-in from close range after   palmed away an effort by Stephan Lichtsteiner.
 
 Sommer then produced another fine stop to deny Valencia forward Rodrigo, while Nacho grazed the post with a curling strike late on as Spain's unbeaten run under   stretched to 19 matches.
 
 "I'm happy on a personal level to have helped the team. We felt good out there, this match will help us to strike the right balance," Odriozola told Spanish TV.
 
 "If you had told me that (I'd have scored for Spain) a year and a half ago, I wouldn't have believed it," said the 22-year-old who was playing for the Real Sociedad reserve team in the third division until 2017.
 
 "That's life and that's football, it's the reward for working every day."
