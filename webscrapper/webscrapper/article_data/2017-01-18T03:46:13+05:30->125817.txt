Gurgaon/New Delhi: Chilly winds swept Gurgaon on Tuesday, reducing the maximum temperature from 18.7 degrees Celsius recorded on Monday to 18 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The minimum temperature was 6 degrees Celsius, though the real feel was chillier.

 Delhi was colder, reversing last week’s trend when the minimum temperature in Gurgaon had fallen a couple of notches below Delhi’s. On Tuesday, Delhi’s main   station at   recorded a maximum of 15.7 degrees C, more than 4 degrees C below normal. A lower day temperature was last seen in the capital on January 8, 2015 — when 14.7 degrees C was recorded, as per data from meteorological website Ogimet — though Tuesday’s maximum was matched on January 20 last year.
 
 “The chill in northwest India is being caused by a cold air outbreak from the north, in the aftermath of a western disturbance passing through the region. The spell is likely to last another two-three days,” said Ravinder Vishen, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. Vishen said day temperatures may increase a few notches on Wednesday as wind speeds drop but the night could be colder by a degree or so.
 
 Delhi’s lowest temperature was a chilling 3.8 degrees C at Jafarpur in southwest Delhi. The met office said the weather is likely to get milder from January 21, when another western disturbance (WD) is expected to hit the western  .
