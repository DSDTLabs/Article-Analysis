BENGALURU: Members of Anti-Gauri Lankesh Killing   on Monday said the special investigation team (SIT) must expedite investigation. 

 “This case should not become like that of Kalburagi, Pansare or Dabholkar which still remain unsolved,” forum member K   said. 
 
 Asked if she had interacted with the SIT before commenting on the pace of investigation, Neela said: “We are not bothered what the SIT is doing or how much effort it has put in. The trend of killing ideologists and thinkers must come to an end. Whatever may be the ideology — left or right — killing is not the answer.” 
 
 The members however said that they are happy with the SIT probe and not demanding a   inquiry.
