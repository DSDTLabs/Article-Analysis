NEW DELHI: In a first, the   of   for   has a   on “violation of   and contemptuous behaviour by   with MLAs”. 

 The move comes following the ongoing tussle between Delhi government and bureaucrats. Its constitution is being justified on the ground that it is in line with a similar committee in Lok Sabha that looks into issues related to protocol. 
 
 AAP’s Greater Kailash MLA, Saurabh Bharadwaj, has been made the chairman of the committee that includes Sanjeev Jha, Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Fateh Singh, Bhavna Gaur, Som Dutt, Vishesh Ravi, Pankaj Pushkar and Surender Singh. There is no BJP MLA on the panel. 
 
 Bharadwaj told TOI that   were increasingly complaining about officers not meeting them since the alleged attack on chief secretary Anshu Prakash. He added that since the decision was taken, MLAs claimed that officers have started giving them time. 
 
 Meanwhile, the list of committees reconstituted brings back many of the 21 AAP MLAs who were disqualified in the office of profit case and were later reinstated.
