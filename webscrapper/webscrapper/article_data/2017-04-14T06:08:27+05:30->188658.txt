AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday asked government officials concerned to work on   – a government holiday – to give justice to a sweeper by regularizing his job.

 By directing the director of animal husbandry and his staff to attend office on the government holiday, to end the exploitation of a sweeper from Banaskantha district, Justice P P Bhatt commented that if the officials are able to give justice to the sweeper, it would be a real tribute to   on his birth anniversary, the petitioner’s advocate P H Pathak said.
 
 In this case,   has been working as part-time sweeper under the assistant director of a cattle breeding farm for 37 years, for the meagre pay of just Rs 675 per month.
 
 Ghelabhai was taken into service in 1980 in the animal husbandry department in the place of his grandmother, who left the job due to her ill health. The state government came up with a resolution in 1980 that such part-time workers can be accommodated in regular Class IV jobs.
 
 However, instead of making him a regular employee, the department decided to terminate Ghelabhai’s services. He moved the HC in 2006, which stayed the department’s decision to relieve him. As the issue was in litigation, Ghelabhai’s job continued, but his pay remained low. The court finally asked the department to regularize him.
 
 When the case came up for hearing before Justice Bhatt, the court inquired about the status on Thursday. The officials told the court that the director of animal husbandry was in Delhi and hence the paperwork could not be completed. The judge asked all the officials concerned to work on April 14, to complete the formalities and regularize the sweeper’s government job.
