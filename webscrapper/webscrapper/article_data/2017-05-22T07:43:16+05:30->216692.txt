KOTTAYAM: The selection process of the   (melshanthi) of all the major temples, under the   (TDB), will undergo a change. According to TDB president Prayar  , the selection will be made through draw of lots. 

 Till now the appointments were made by the devaswom board's assistant commissioner and there were many criteria for getting selected. In the new system, a minimum of five persons will be shortlisted from the applicants through an interview and the chief priest will be selected from the shortlisted persons. He also said that, at present, this system will be implemented in major temples only.
 
 He added that the change in the selection process was being introduced to reduce malpractices and corruption in the selection process. 
 
 At present, the chief priest of the   temple is also selected through draw of lots. Only those with the deep knowledge of mantras and working as chief priest of major temples continuously for a minimum period of 10 years could apply for the post of the Sabarimala and Malikapurathu temple chief priest's post.
