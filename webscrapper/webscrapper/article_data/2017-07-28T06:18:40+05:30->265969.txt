KOLKATA: At a time when the vegetable price is sky-rocketing in city markets, agriculture authorities of two adjoining districts of South and North 24  , which meet 70% of city's vegetable demand, have made it clear that heavy rain did not hit the production and supply. They, instead, suspect a windfall of profit is being pocketed by a section of middlemen in the supply chain.

 On Thursday, prices of almost all vegetables were found to have risen by Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kg compared to a week ago. But, the retail price is almost three times more than the price at which the farmer is selling his vegetables. It's found that the first middleman, who is buying vegetables from farmer, is jacking the price by pocketing the maximum profit.
 
 The buzz in the retail market is that a huge quantity of vegetables rotted in the field due to heavy rain and waterlogged fields. This has increased the demand-supply gap.“But the reality is that none of our fields are under water.The supply was hit on the first day of heavy rain due to nonavailability of labourers. But normal supply resumed next day,“ said South 24 Parganas Krishi Karmadhakshya Shahjahan  .
 
 Sirajul Islam, Krishi Karmadhakshya of North 24 Parganas, said, “There is water in some pockets. But water is also receding fast. But it had no impact on the crops.“ Mollah said that 16 government trucks are engaged in supplying vegetables. “But some traders in the supply chain are jacking the price. These dishonest traders, who are very wealthy and often hold back vegetables to dictate the price rise, must be identified and punished,“ said Mollah. Samsuddin Laskar from angor, who acts as a midd Bhangor, who acts as a middleman, said, “We faced acute labour problem. That's why supply took a hit. Huge quantity of vegetables rotted in the fields. Apart from farmers, we also suffered huge loss.“ But, farmers from the districts confirmed that there was no effect on production.
