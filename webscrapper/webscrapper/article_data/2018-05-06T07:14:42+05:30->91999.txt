 The Thiruvananthapuram-bound train, which was arriving from Delhi, reached the station at 10.30am.
 
 “The train, which will have a speed of around 10kmph while coming to the station, will be checked for any hanging parts or irregularities in the body. During such an examination of the   Express, a crack was identified, following which the passengers in the coach were shifted and accommodated in other coaches,” said Ernakulam South station director  .
 
 The coach, a 2002-make, was later moved to the yard for further inspection and to identify the cause of the crack.
 
 “After the separation of the coach, the train continued its journey to Thiruvananthapuram at 11.27am,” the director added.
 
 The train had break-power certificate, which is issued after a six-hour-long inspection for a span of four days or 3,500 km, which indicates that the crack is a recently developed one, according to officials.
