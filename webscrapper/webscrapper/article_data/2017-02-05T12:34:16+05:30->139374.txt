BERHAMPUR:  , a sarpanch candidate of the   in  's Belaguntha block, has allegedly been missing since Friday.

 Congress Pradhan, the elder brother of the missing candidate, lodged a complaint in this regard at the police outpost at Belaguntha, on Saturday.
 "Family members had been looking for him everywhere but after they failed to notice him, his brother lodged the complaint to the police. His mobile was found to be switched off. A missing case has been registered. The search is on to locate him," said Bhanjanagar sub-divisional police officer,  .
 
 "Pramod was at Bhanjanagar at around 1 pm for registration of land at the sub-registrar's office here. He had then sent some money, to be handed over to his wife, through one of his relatives. But we do not know where he has been henceforth. He did not attend the rally that was scheduled to be held in the village on Friday, in which Sorada BJD MLA Purna Chandra Swain was to appear, nor did he return home last night," said Bhanjanagar police station inspector-in-charge, Aswini Kumar Sahu.
 
 Pradhan is reportedly a supporter of the BJD. A social worker, he was running against two others for the sarpanch post of the panchayat.
 "We are not ruling out the possibility that he was kidnapped by opponents," said Pramod's brother. Supporters too allege that Pradhan's popularity might indeed have resulted in him being kidnapped.
