 “I will be in Hyderabad on February 27 and meet officials of the NRI Department and others to highlight ways to promote safe migrationof emigrants and prevent trafficking of women from Telangana,“ MC Luther, PGE, New Delhi told TOI.
 
 Sources said, a large number of illegal recruiting agents operate in Old City to trap women and send them to Gulf. There are only six authorised recruiting agencies in the country , including TOMCOM of Telangana, located in Hyderabad. Illegal recruiting agents operate in a chain. A local Hyderabad agent generally works for an agent in Mumbai. This agent has connections in the Gulf countries. The main agent in the gulf country is given an amount of `3 lakh by the Kafil (employer) to get a person to work for him in that country. The money is shared by the three agents. The women who are trafficked are given a rosy picture of life in Saudi Arabia or other gulf countries and offered big amounts as salaries.
 
 On landing there, the women who realise that they have been trapped and want to leave are not allowed to by the Kafil. The agent also refuses to help because he has received money in the chain of human trafficking. For this reason, the Embassy of India in Riyadh has issued a reminder of guidelines to people who are seeking employment in the gulf. The Telangana Overseas Manpower Company Limited has also alerted people, especially women, against falling prey to illegal agents.
