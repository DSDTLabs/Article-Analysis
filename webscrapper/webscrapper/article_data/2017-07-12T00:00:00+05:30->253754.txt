The wedding reception of director VK Prakash’s daughter Kavya and Sandeep was truly a star-studded affair with the who’s who of Mollywood attending the do to wish the newly-weds. The lavish event was held at a hotel in Kochi.

 Couples  ,   were the cynosure of all eyes. Asif Ali turned up with his son Adam, wearing matching blue attires, while Anoop Menon opted for a white and white combination to go along with his thick Singam-style moustache.
 
 We also spotted Remya Nambeesan, Anumol and Honey Rose, who dazzled in their simple-yet-classy attires. The guests were also given either a sapling of a paradise or neem tree as return gifts.
