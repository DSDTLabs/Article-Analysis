Bhopal: Villagers affected by the Machagora dam in Chhindwara district have asked local administration to ‘rehabilitate’ Lord Shiva.

 The villagers of Jamunia and Gadra have claimed that the age old Shiva temple located between the two villages has been submerged due to increase in water levels of the dam and demanded rehabilitation for it from the administration, sources said.
 
 Machagora dam is situated in the Bamanwada village of the Chhindwara district. At least 30 villages have been affected by the dam; and of these, eight were completely submerged and 4 partially submerged. Remaining villages, including Jamunia and Gadra, were also affected substantially.
 
 When contacted, Chhindwara collector JK Jain said, “The entire rehabilitation process has been completed. Each and every villager who lost his house has been rehabilitated and those who only lost their farm land were provided with compensation as per norms.”
 
 Jain added that there were some issues that would be addressed soon, including that of the temple’s rehabilitation. But he has denied that there has been any increase in the dam’s water level.
 
 “The maximum water level of the dam is 625.75 and this year it has reached 624.83 meters,” he added.
 
 On the other hand, sources said that even though the permitted water level of the dam is 625.75 meters, the maximum water level that was reached till last year was only 621 metres. The increase of four metres in water level has led to submergence of other areas.
 
 But officials have refuted this claim. “There are some areas which have been already acquired and compensation for them paid against them. But since they were not under submergence, the locals continue to cultivate them. Thus when there is an increase in water, they think new areas have come under submergence,” said an official.
