MADURAI: For R  , his homecoming was a proud moment, as he had proved to be the best bull tamer at the  ,  . Riding a   bullet, which he had won in the event apart from several gold and silver medals, he returned to his village where he received a warm welcome.

 The 34-year-old father of three won many hearts because of his bravery and courage. While some were fascinated by his fearless approach, others were amazed at his boundless stamina, as he stood in the arena from morning to evening, unmindful of the scorching sun. 
 
 When the   event began in the morning, R Karuppanan, a farmer by profession, dressed in a t-shirt and assigned the number 174, was just like any other bull-tamer staking his claim to be the best. By the end of the event, he had emerged a hero. Even the higher officials conducting the event were impressed with his skill in handling bulls. He successfully tamed nine bulls while the runner up tamed seven.
 
 There were 1525 odd tamers vying for the top spot. While other tamers came and went, Karuppanan anchored himself at the spot just by his sheer performance. For every bull he tamed, the crowd cheered him on.
 
 “I have taken part in many jallikattu events but this is the most memorable one. I have tamed several bulls but the best prize I have won so far was a cycle. My family and entire village will be proud of my performance,” he said.
 
 Karuppanan dedicated the win to students of Tamil Nadu who protested for jallikattu. “I have been into bull-taming for the past 17 years. I have been training consistently to improve my performance. I also participate in ‘vadamadu manjuvirattu’ which is a different kind of bull taming event conducted in Melur,” he said. 
 
 However, this is not Karuppanan’s best performance. He had tamed 10 bulls in an event held in Theni district.
