Navi Mumbai: A juvenile spotted owlet, which appeared  , was   from   on Monday afternoon. The   was taken care of and nursed by wildlife activist, Anand Madhvi of Vanjeev Nisarg Saurakshan Samiti (VNSS).

 “After VNSS volunteers found it lying on the ground, we informed local forest officials and provided primary medical aid to the bird of prey. The owl was dehydrated and disoriented as a result of rising summer temperatures. Within 12 hours of care, the owlet showed signs of improvement,” Madhvi said, and added that it was released in a forested area in Chirner on Tuesday as it was strong enough to fly. “With the help of co-activists and volunteers, we are spreading awareness among residents to keep water-filled bowls around houses and on terraces for birds who may be thirsty in the summer conditions,” he said.
 
 VNSS on Tuesday also released a rescued Brahminy   whose right wing had been damaged after encountering sharp manja thread. “We took care of the kite for nearly 45 days to ensure that its wing gets fine, after consulting a vet and forest officials. Since the kite had started gaining strength and was able to fly, we released it in a forest region in Uran. Team members Nitin Madhvi, M Gharat and Sumit Madhvi took active part in the kite’s care,” said the wildlife activist.
 
 The spotted owlet (Athene brama) breeds in tropical Asia from mainland India to south-east Asia. A common resident of open habitats, including farmland and human habitation, it has adapted to living in cities. They roost in small groups in the hollows of trees or in cavities in rocks or buildings. It nests in a hole in a tree or building, laying three to five eggs. They are often found near human habitation.
