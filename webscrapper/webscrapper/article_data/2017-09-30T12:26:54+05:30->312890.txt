 and Lupita  'o could be the next two of the Charlie's Angels. Stewart and Nyong'o are reportedly in 'early talks' to star in Sony's 'Charlie's Angels' reboot, which will be directed by Elizabeth Banks, who just recently made her directorial debut with 'Pitch Perfect 2.'

  
  
  Along with directing, Banks will also produce the movie with Elizabeth Cantillon and Max Handelman. The film is originally based on the 1976-1981 television series, which starred Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith.
 
  But subsequently, the series was later given the big screen treatment in 2000, with Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu playing as the crime-fighting angels working at a private detective agency for the mysterious, unseen Charlie Townsend.
 
  That film was a major hit even as it went on to make $264M at the box office and spun the 2003 sequel 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,' which pulled in $259M worldwide. The reboot is slated for release on June 7, 2019.
