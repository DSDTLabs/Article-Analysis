Hyderabad: City-based Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd (REEL), which provides environment and waste management services, has drawn up plans to invest Rs 900-1,000 crore in its Indian and overseas operations over the next two years as part of its plans to make it to the league of top 10 environmental engineering companies in the world over the next five years, a top company official said here on Wednesday.

 REEL, which raked in a turnover of Rs 1550 crore in FY17 and hopes to close FY18 with Rs 1,800 crore, is gunning for revenues of Rs 3400-3500 crore over the next two years with a larger play in the domestic an international markets, Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd managing director and CEO M Goutham Reddy told newspersons here. “Currently our international operations roughly contribute nearly one-third to revenues and this should reach 50% of revenues over the next five years,” said Goutham Reddy, pointing out that the company is eyeing waste management opportunities in emerging markets in the Indian sub-continent, Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. In fact, of the Rs 1,800 crore revenue target set for FY18, he said the company expects Rs 600 crore from international operations and Rs 1,200 crore from Indian operations. As part of its growing international ambitions, REEL has already acquired 50% stake in Texas-based marine pollution management services provider Nature Environmental Marine Services (NEMS) making Ramky the first Indian player to foray into this niche segment, Reddy said. Though he refused to divulge the size of the acquisition, he said NEMS does a business of about $5-6 million per annum and REEL may explore the possibility of acquiring the balance equity in the US company in the future.
 
 Back home in India, it has a 48MW waste to energy plant coming up at Jawaharnagar in Hyderabad at a cost of Rs 330-340 crore on a BOT (build own transfer) basis. “The first phase of the plant, 20 MW, is under construction after various hurdles and is expected to become operational by February-March 2019,” he said.
