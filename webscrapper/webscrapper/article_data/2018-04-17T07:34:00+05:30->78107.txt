Open Manholes In Sec 17’s Dead Corridor

 Chandigarh: The Sector 17-A market compound behind Hotel Oyster has become a grim spectacle with heaps of garbage. At two points on the edge of its corridors lie half-open manholes that have spilled a lot of sewage on the road and become a source of inconvenience to pedestrians and the nearby shopkeepers.
 
 Flies and mosquitoes hover over the puddles of stagnant water around these open pits. “This section of Sector 17 has been degenerating since a popular liquor shop closed in this corridor. Stagnant water, however, is a long-standing issue and we are tired battling with this problem. The stench at times becomes unbearable,” said Shubham, a supervisor in one of the rented showrooms of the corridor.
 
 The surroundings as well have become highly unhygienic. A number of circular sitting zones are covered in filth and garbage of various proportions. The once clean internal carpet of grass is now a dump yard. The periphery of this section of the market is also covered in dense undergrowth, with a large patch taken over by the itchy congress weed. The undergrowth has added greatly to the grim standard of cleanliness in the surroundings.
 
 “Our time in this corridor has been difficult exceedingly. We have tried complaining to everyone we could approach. The lack of maintenance of a part of the city’s central market of Sector 17 is surprising in itself. It is the result of sheer apathy of the   authorities. Garbage is dumped everywhere in this section and water seepage is common, too. What should we do?” said Raju, one of the shops workers of this section.
