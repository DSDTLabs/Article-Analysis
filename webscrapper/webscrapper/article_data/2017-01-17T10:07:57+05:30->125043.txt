LUCKNOW: With the rise in day and night temperatures, residents on Monday were in for some relief from chilly conditions prevailing in the city for the past five days. Fog, however, was back during the morning hours. 

 Similar weather is expected from Tuesday to Thursday but temperatures will start falling again from Friday.
 
 The minimum temperature was 4.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. Fog during morning hours reduced visibility below 200 metres. However, sky was clear by 10am. 
 
 Bright sunshine led to rise in maximum temperature to 24.3 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.
 
 The rise in temperature came as a relief because the city was witnessing extremely low mercury levels for the past six days. Temperatures started dropping on January 11 and plummeted to freezing level (0.1 degrees Celsius) on January 13. The gradual rise seen in the past two days is expected to continue till Thursday.
 
 On Tuesday, shallow to moderate fog is expected in the morning, while maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to be around 24 and 5 degrees Celsius, respectively. On Wednesday and Thursday, maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 23-24 and 6-7 degrees Celsius, respectively. Shallow fog is also expected. However, on Friday and Saturday, maximum and minimum temperatures would drop to around 21-22 degrees Celsius and 4-5 degrees Celsius, respectively. Density of fog will also increase.
 
 State Met officials said that the western disturbance (WD) over the hills causing snowfall has restricted flow of icy winds towards plains, leading to rise in temperatures. The WD is expected to last till Thursday, following which   winds would revive.
 
 Meanwhile, fog continued to affect rail services. Around two trains, Kanpur-Pratapgarh Intercity express and Patna-Kota express were cancelled, while several trains were running behind schedule.
