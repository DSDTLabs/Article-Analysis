CHENNAI: Failure to produce a bank statement regarding funds collected from buyers and deposited in a separate bank account has cost a promoter dear as the   (TNRERA) refused to register his housing layout. It became the first real estate project to be rejected by the state's realty regulator. Housing plots in the layout cannot be sold without registering with the real estate regulator. 

 As per the TNRERA portal, the layout is located on   at   village in Hosur taluk of   district. The promoter is Sri Balaji Constructions. TNRERA sources said that the promoter did not provide necessary documents for registration - altogether 17 particulars, including copies of planning permission approval, planning permit, local body approval letter and patta. Official sources said that the promoter did not provide documents such as statement of depositing 70% of the funds collected from buyers in a separate bank account, copies of approved plan and encumbrance certificate. "The promoter was given an opportunity to furnish the required details, but did not produce them. Hence, the registration of the project has been rejected," a source familiar to the developments said.
 
 The Real Estate (Regulatory and Development) Act, 2016, mandates that 70% of the money realised for the real estate projects from the allottees shall be deposited from time to time in a separate account to be maintained in a scheduled bank to cover the cost of construction and land cost. Noting that it was the first real estate project to be rejected by the TNRERA, sources said that two more promoters have withdrawn their projects after filing applications. The two projects are located near the city at   and Polachery village of Tiruporur taluk in Kancheepuram district.
