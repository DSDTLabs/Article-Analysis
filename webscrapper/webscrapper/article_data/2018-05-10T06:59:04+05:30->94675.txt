KOCHI: A room full of drones and another with antique-looking   showing India without Kashmir; these are not sights from a museum or a shopping mall but from the warehouse of   department, which houses seized goods, at Willingdon Island here.

 Customs officers said the number of drones in their possession now was over 600 as they religiously seize gadgets brought in by international passengers without the permission of the director general of civil aviation, director general of foreign trade and wireless advisor to the Government of India.
 
 Customs commissioner Sumit Kumar said the   had become a menace as they occupied most of the shelf space in the warehouse. “Those bringing in drones have increased in the past two years, with many unaware of the law. Drones can be brought into the country only with the permission of agencies concerned,” he said.
 
 The only option before the customs is to destroy them but they can’t hire any external agency for that as there is always a chance of misuse. Kumar, however, said he was not ordering destruction of seized drones as the rules could change in future. “We will be able to auction them out then. In fact, we plan to approach authorities for more space to store seized goods,” he said.
 
 An officer said drones are mostly brought abroad by NRKs and returning tourists. “The seized drones even include those priced Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000,” he said.
 
 Globes with the incorrect map of India is another common seizure. They show Kashmir in a different colour and have a major portion of the top part of India disfigured. The border is shown way inside the country.
 
 Officers said most of these products were suspected to be made in China. P 5
