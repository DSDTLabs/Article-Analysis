NEW DELHI: The government has done away with the requirement of a commercial licence for driving taxis, three wheelers, e-rickshaws and two-wheelers (food delivery etc), allowing drivers to use their private licences for the same. However, the mandate for a commercial   remains in force for trucks, buses and other heavy commercial vehicles. 

 The   issued an advisory on Monday to the state governments to follow this norm in order to comply with a   order of July 2017. Ministry officials said this is likely to increase employment opportunities for lakhs of drivers. 
 
 Till recently, getting a commercial licence was necessary to drive any transport vehicle. Usually, people needed to wait for one year to get the commercial licence after obtaining a private driving licence. “This will end a lot of corruption involved in obtaining transport or commercial licences. The states must also do away with issuing badges for those driving commercial vehicles,” said a ministry official. 
 
 Though there is a fear that the decision will increase congestion on the roads because of the addition of more taxis, e-rickshaws and threewheelers, ministry officials said more availability of such vehicles will reduce dependence on private vehicles. 
 
 “In an ideal condition, one cab replaces at least six private cars and an autorickshaw substitutes over a dozen cars since these are on the move and need little parking space,” said  , an expert on transport issues.
