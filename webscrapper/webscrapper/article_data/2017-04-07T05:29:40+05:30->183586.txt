BENGALURU:   Branch sleuths arrested a 45year-old   from  ,  , on Thursday for allegedly lending money to foreigners at exorbitant interest rates.

 Muniraj Byanna, from St Thomas Town, would lend money to foreigners, particularly Nigerians and other African nationals, after getting them to pledge their passports and other valuables with him as guarantee, police said.
 
 Sureties recovered from Muniraj included 341 passports of Nigerian nationals, 83 residential permits, 155 mobile phones, 93 laptops, four motorcycles and seven cars, besides Rs 34 lakh in cash. “Muniraj preferred foreign nationals as customers because he was confident they (borrowers) would be ignorant about Indian laws and the Reserve Bank of India's cap on interest rate,“ a police officer said. Muniraj would take their passports as surety. This was because without the bluebooks, they would never be able to leave the country in case of a default. He was equally sure they would be vulnerable in foreign lands and pay high interest rate out of desperation,“ a police officer said.The moneylender banked on his intelligence rather too much. “One such victim, a Nigerian national, tipped us off, saying Muniraj is refusing to return his passport,“ a CCB source said.
 
 Muniraj was a familiar face among foreign students staying in north and northeast parts of the city. “He I would visit pubs frequented by these foreign students and lend money to those who were running dry and help them pay bills,“ a source said. Be sides charging high interest rate, the usurer levied penal fee and compound interest.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (crime) S Ravi said they will investigate whether Muniraj was involved in other illegal activities like drug peddling. “By looking at the number of passports with him, we suspect he is involved is other rackets too,“ he said.
