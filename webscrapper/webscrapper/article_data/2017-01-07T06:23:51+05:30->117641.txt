NAVI MUMBAI: The civic administration has simplified the procedure for occupants of   built before 2000 to get legal   connections. 

 The slum dwellers need to just produce two documents for the connection. With almost 16% loss of water, the administration has been trying to find means to fix pilferage. 
 
 Last year, almost 3,000 connections were disconnected but the problem still persists. Officials said that giving   connections will address the problem. The civic administration is also seeing it as means to earn revenue. 
 
 “There were a lot of slum pockets across Digha and Belapur where water was being consumed without payment of taxes,” said a civic official.
 
 He added that by regularizing the process,   will get a clear understanding of the number of users and levy taxes accordingly.
 
 Even the residents have heaved a sigh of relief as they no longer have to resort to illegal means. “The administration has listed out 15 documents, of which the slum dwellers need to produce just two. This is a major relief,” said a Turbhe resident,  . —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
