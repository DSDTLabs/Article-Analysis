Jaipur: High Court dismissed a petition against Rajasthan cadre IAS officer Ajitabh Sharma, currently posted as principal secretary of revenue department challenging his cadre allocation by another IAS officer of Nagaland cadre, V Shashank Shekhar, claiming that the DoPT erred in giving Ajitabh Sharma Rajasthan cadre overlooking his claim.

 The division bench of K S Jhaveri and Bhanwarilal Sharma dismissed a writ petition on the ground that after 22 years, cadre change is not possible and even other wise also there is not vested right of IAS officers in the matter of allotment of cadre.
 
 The petitioner claimed that he was higher in merit than Ajitabh Sharma and therefore he should have given the Rajasthan cadre instead of Ajitabh Sharma. Shekhar is presently posted as joint secretary in the ministry of Home affairs in Delhi on deputation.
 
 Additional Solicitor General R D Rastogi appearing for the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) of the Union government argued that claim of Shashank Shekhar was unfounded since Ajitabh Sharma, though an OBC candidate, was selected on merit without taking the benefit of the OBC quota. So, he said Ajitabh Sharma could not be put in the disadvantageous position just because he got appointment in the general category as per merit position. 
 
 He said, Alok Gupta was general candidate who was given Rajasthan cadre and Ajitabh sharma was given appointment against OBC vacancy. Another candidate Rajesh Yadav was given appointment in Rajasthan cadre as OBC in outsider quota and Dinesh Kumar as Scheduled Caste in 1996. So there is no error in the allocation of cadre.
