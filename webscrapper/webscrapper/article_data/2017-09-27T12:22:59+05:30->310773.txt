 wore an absolutely stunning black velvet corset by   at the Ambani's party and she was looking no less than a vision. But guess what, she is a woman who is a mom, in her 40s and a divorcee and the users don’t seem to like her aplomb. She was mom-shamed, age-shamed, period-shamed, makeup-shamed and had to face racist comments for pulling off a dress so perfectly.

  
  
 The party was attended by the who’s who of  , however, the most talked about has been Malaika Arora. As soon as she posted her photograph from the party on her   account, all kinds of comments started flooding in, some advising her that the dress is “not for your (her) age” while somebody commenting that she is going through her “menopause”.
 
 A user didn’t seem to like her make-up and the fact that she belongs to a certain region of India and commented, “Ohh mallu. So much makeup. How many killogrammes (sic).” Her being a mom and dauntingly wearing such a dress also invoked users to didactically comment that it is not a dress “which suits a mom”. 
 
 Why do women have to go through constant critique all their lives? If a wee bulge peeks out, they are body-shamed, if the skirts are an inch shorter, they are slut-shamed, if the wreaking-havoc period leaves a teeny stain, she is period shamed, and now, we all have all kinds of shaming the Bollywood star has to go through. It is sad how difficult it is to not be judged in any corner of this country.
