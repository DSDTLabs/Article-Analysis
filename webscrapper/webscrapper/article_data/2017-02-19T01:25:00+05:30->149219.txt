URUGRAM: It’s been the same story for 23 years, and worse over the last few. 

  to Sector 22 keeps getting disrupted every two weeks, and the situation has only worsened since the   (MCG) took over.
 
 Residents complain that the water crisis worsens during the weekend as the demand increases. Around 100 houses in the area are located at a slight gradient and they are the worst affected.
 
 “The water situation in the area has been such for 23 years now. When a water tank was set up in the area last year, we expected things to improve. But water shortage continues to prevail,” said  , RWA president of Sector 22.
 
 Last year, Huda set up a 5,000-litre tank in the area to address the problems. It provided limited relief as hundreds still continue to reel under the shortage. Singh said that the water pipeline is only four inches wide, so it fails to sustain the water pressure from the boosting station and tears down often. “Every week, the pipeline bursts and the MCG employees are not available over the weekend to fix it, making the situation worse. Low water levels in the underground water tank add to the misery,” said Singh.
 
 Other residents echoed similar concerns. “A tube well was dug here around a year back to address the problem of water shortage but it does not even have an electrical connection yet,” said Punam Verma, a resident from the area.
 
  When contacted, MCG officials said that Huda was in the process of laying a master pipeline for sectors 21, 22 and 23 and the issue would soon be resolved. “The old pipes are being replaced. We have already covered Sector 23,” said  , executive engineer, civic body.
