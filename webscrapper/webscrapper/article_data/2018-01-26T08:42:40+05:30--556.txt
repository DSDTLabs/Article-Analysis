PUNE: Residents of over 200 housing societies from   on   have approached member of Parliament Anil   seeking solutions to their civic problems.

 They want Wagholi to be merged in the   limits, a dedicated fire station and an MSEDCL sub-station. Wagholi witnessed significant expansion in real estate in the last few years because of its proximity to Kharadi IT park, the airport and to Pune . 
 
 These housing societies recently formed Wagholi Housing Society Association (WHSA) forum to raise their issues. The residents have said that no new constructions should be allowed in this area unless the current infrastructure is upgraded.
 
 The association’s representatives met Shirole recently about the infrastructural problems in Wagholi. Over 50,000 people live in these societies.
 
 The association’s chairman   said the residents have been talking about these issues at various forums. "We have been talking with the gram panchayat members, but the issues have not been resolved. The gram panchayat has limited scope and infrastructure to deal with such issues. We have decided to put forth our problems on different platforms,” he said.
 
 The residents said a police station to enforce traffic rules, banning of heavy vehicles during the day, closure of punctures at medians, demolition of illegal buildings, no permission to constructions till the infrastructure is developed and approach roads were immediate needs. 
 
 For the long term, they sought the construction of a flyover, extension of the   rail up to Wagholi, sewage and garbage disposal facility, rainwater harvesting to improve ground level water and water supply to Wagholi through Bhama Askhed dam.
