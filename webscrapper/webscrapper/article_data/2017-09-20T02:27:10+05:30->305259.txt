MUMBAI: Nine years after their arrest in the   case, a special   on Tuesday granted bail to two accused,   and  . The order comes a month after key accused   was granted relief by the   on August 21.

 After the verdict, Dwivedi said, “I am a victim of the system and have always denied I was Dyanand Pandey [as claimed by NIA].” His lawyer Ranjeet Sangle said the relief was granted on Rs 5 lakh cash bail.
 
 An RDX bomb allegedly fitted on Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur’s bike exploded on September 29, 2008, killing six and injuring 101. On April 25, the HC granted bail to Thakur. Dwivedi, also known as known as Swamy Amrutanand Dev Teerth or Shankaracharya, was accused of participating in meetings and asking Purohit to arrange for RDX.
 
 In the judgement copy, the court said, “Nowhere is it the case of the prosecution that A10 (Dwivedi) was carrying RDX or was engaged in preparing bomb... that in the said meeting bomb blast was discussed.” It also said that when Thakur and Purohit were granted bail, Dwivedi cannot be detained further on the ground that he was in contact with them. It held that the mere discussion in the meetings falls short to say that there is prima facie case against Dwivedi and Chaturvedi. 
 
 The court pointed out that the alleged presence of RDX at Chaturvedi’s home, an allegation also made against Purohit, was not considered to deny bail to Purohit by the SC.
