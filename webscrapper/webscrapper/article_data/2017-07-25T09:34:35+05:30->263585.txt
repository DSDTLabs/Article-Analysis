NEW DELHI: Students may soon be able to get a learner’s   at their colleges. According to a proposal by Delhi government,   will be authorised to issue the licence.

 Youths, mostly students, form the bulk of those applying for learner’s licences every year. Of the 4.17 lakh learner’s licences issued in 2016, 53% were in the age group of 18-25 years and 25% in 25-35 years.
 
 Government officials said the beginning is likely to be made from polytechnics and colleges under Delhi government. Applicants will have to give an online test and answer six out of 10 objective-type questions correctly to get a learner’s licence. “The server of the   would be linked with the transport department using Sarathi software for the computer test,” said an official.
 
 The modalities of the proposal will be discussed soon in a meeting with deputy CM Manish Sisodia. “We will consult educational institutions to take them on board. This facility will not only ensure that students get the licence at their institutions, but it will also result in lesser pressure at the authority offices,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.
 
 Educators were, however, sceptical about the proposal. SK Garg, principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, said, “Where is the space to conduct the trials in colleges?” But GK Jha, principal of Atma Ram Sanatan Dharm College, said this will help students avoid the long queues at RTO offices.
 
 Dinesh Khattar, principal of Kirori Mal College was not in favour of this move. “Colleges are already burdened with many things,” he said.
