GREATER NOIDA: An eight-member committee has been set up by   Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to acquire land for the sanctioned international airport in  . The Authority, which is the nodal agency for the project, is, meanwhile, awaiting a nod from the state government regarding the funds required for land acquisition. It needs at least Rs 3,000 crore for the first phase of the project.

 Officials said the committee was formed by the Authority last week and it includes an officer on special duty, two tehsildars, a senior project manager, a senior planning manager, a revenue officer and two lekhpals. The panel will initiate acquisition of land for the project in three phases.
 
 “The airport is to be developed in three phases across 3,000 hectares of land. In the first phase of the project, about 1,250 hectares of land will be required. To acquire this land, YEIDA will require about Rs 3,000 crore. This committee will do its homework to ensure the earmarked land is free from any dispute and can be acquired immediately without any delay as soon as we get a go-ahead from the state government,” Amarnath Upadhyay, additional CEO (ACEO), YEIDA, told TOI.
 
 YEIDA is, however, yet to get a final approval from the state government for the funds required for land acquisition. An in-principal approval has already been obtained from two central government agencies — Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO) and NCR Planning Board (NCRPB) — for a loan towards the project.
 
 While HUDCO has agreed to give the entire loan of Rs 3,000 crore at an interest rate of Rs 10.5%, NCRPB has agreed to give Rs 500 crore at an interest rate of 7.5%. The proposal is currently pending with the state government.
 
 In order to expedite the project, the   has also started the process of selecting a consultant to prepare a techno-feasibility report. The report comprises of a survey of land, impact on ecology and technical issues related to the project.
