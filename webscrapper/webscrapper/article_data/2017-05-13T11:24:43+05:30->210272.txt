CHANDIGARH: Highlighting the problem of huge number of cases pending in Indian courts,   judge A K Sikri compared litigation with a demon, Raktbeej, which according to myth had a boon that whenever a drop of his blood fell on the ground, a duplicate demon would be born at that spot. 

 Speaking during the inaugural session of three-day   Conference series at Chandigarh Judicial Academy on Friday, justice Sikri said, "Efforts to deal with litigation by all stakeholders have borne little fruits. With one case, there come 5 to 7 related cases. This Raktbeej needs to be killed and it can be done only by mediation. In our adversarial judicial system only mediation can deliver justice."
 
 The   high court is hosting the India chapter of Global Pound Conference series 2016-2017. This is for the first time that this conference is being held in India and Chandigarh has been chosen for a round of brainstorming on the nuances of commercial dispute resolution tools.
 
 The conference is being attended by foreign delegates and representatives. The theme of this conference is 'Shaping the future of dispute resolution and improving access to justice'.
 
 Punjab and Haryana high court chief justice   said, "Justice delayed is justice denied but justice hurried is justice buried. The mediation is the solution to people's problems." 
 
 Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur said it's time to think out of box so that justice could be delivered to public.
