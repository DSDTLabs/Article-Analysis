BENGALURU: The state government on Tuesday sent an official request to the   seeking 250 "randomly selected" electronic voting machines to conduct a public EVM hackathon to dispel doubts over the devices being susceptible to hacking. 

  IT and BT minister   sent the letter to chief election commissioner Achal Kumar Jyothi. He also sought design documents, test descriptions and results, and security procedures used by the   for testing EVMs. 
 
  "I would propose hosting an EVM challenge, jointly organized by the government of Karnataka and the EC, inviting important stakeholders of the   like technocrats, scientists, corporates, R&D institutes, startups and tinkerers and not just political parties to test  ," Kharge says in the letter. 
 
  Justifying the reasons for public participation in the hackathon, Kharge said the challenge must go beyond political parties and should be open to all the bright minds in the country. "The reason is that a lot of individuals or corporates would not like to associate themselves with any political party," the letter reads. 
 
  While hailing the decision of using voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT), Kharge said,"Unless VVPAT is randomly verified with EVMs, it will also fall suspect sooner or later." Last month, the government had said EVMs can't be relied on. It had sought use of ballot paper for the 2018 polls.
