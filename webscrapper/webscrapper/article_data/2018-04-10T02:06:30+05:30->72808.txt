GHAZIABAD: A 15-year-old girl allegedly committed suicide by jumping from her 12th floor rented flat at   in   on Monday. She was suffering from depression for the past one year, police said.

 The girl,  , a student of Class IX at  , was living with her mother Manisha and two siblings—elder sister Shalu and younger brother Kartik. Her father,  , a property dealer, had died two-and-a-half years back. 
 
 The girl’s left hand was found to be severed from shoulder and lying at a distance from the torso. Police said the body hit an iron railing before falling on the ground. The police have sent her body for post-mortem.
 
 The incident took place around 12.40am on Monday in Tower F2 of the society. Security guards posted at the society’s gate number 2 spotted the body and informed the police.
 
 Govindpuram chowki incharge Shrinivas Gautam, who is investigating the case, said, “The girl’s mother and siblings did know that she jumped off. They were sleeping when we knocked on the door and informed them about her daughter falling from the building.”
 
 “Her mother told us that four of them were awake till 12am and had dinner together. Shalini was watching TV and then went to sleep in the same room where her mother and two siblings were sleeping. They did not know when she came out and jumped from the building,” added Gautam.
 
 “Strangely, Shalini's mother told us that she was under the influence of some ‘black magic’. Her siblings said she had attempted suicide some seven-eight months ago by slashing her hand. It was corroborated by the presence of scars on her hand. So far, no FIR has been registered in the matter, although the girl’s mother has given a written statement that her daughter committed suicide,” the police officer added.
 
 Shalini’s cousin  , who lives in the same society, said he got to know about Shalini’s death around 1.30 am. He also confirmed that Shalini was undergoing treatment for depression for the past one year.
