AMRITSAR: Regular visits of Union Minister of   affairs Hardeep Singh Puri to Amritsar has triggered speculations of   high command trying to find a Sikh face in Amritsar with focus on   to strengthen its base among Sikh majority in Punjab ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 In April alone Puri was sent twice to Amritsar by BJP high command, first to attend the party’s nationwide fast on April 12 and then on April 26 to dine and sleep in the house of a Dalit under party’s Dalit outreach programme. 
 
 In February this year also Puri was the first choice of BJP high command over other BJP leaders to receive the visiting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at Amritsar.
 
 Earlier in September 2017 , after taking charge as minister, Puri had visited Amritsar and had shown his keenness for the development of Punjab . He had stated that he would want to utilize the resources of his ministry for the welfare and growth of Punjab.
 
 On May 3 , Puri is again expected to visit Mudhal village in Amritsar where he had dined and spent night in the house of two Dalit families.
 
 “BJP lacks an influential and popular Sikh face in Punjab, Puri is   member parliament from Uttar Pradesh and has adopted Sonbhadra village of the state , ideally he should be seen and visiting more in his adopted village but with his regular visits to Amritsar, there is a buzz in BJP circles here that he could be sent by party high command to contest Lok Sabha seat from Amritsar” said a senior BJP leader who didn’t want to give his name.
 
 Agreeing with the emerging circumstances in BJP , political analyst and senior professor in political science department of Guru Nanak Dev University ,   said there was a possibility that BJP could paratroop Puri in Amritsar with focus of Punjab since after departure of Navjot Singh Sidhu BJP didn’t have any impressive face with Sikh credentials and some standing . “There can’t be any suitable Sikh face for party than   , a retired diplomat” he said.
