Art and artistes don’t have any religion — it’s easier said than done, if you consider actor Eijaz Khan’s personal experience. For the past eight months, he has been unable to get a rented accommodation in   because he is a Muslim and has dogs. 

 Eijaz, who is a part of the TV show ' ', says, “I want to move out of my current apartment because it reminds me of my past (his ex-girlfriend   had stayed there with him), and has become soulless. Also, my dogs have developed arthritis and it’s painful for them to go up and down three floors for their walk. Moreover, the owner wants to sell it off, too. I have tried every nook and corner of Bandra, but in vain. While members of my community don’t want to   out their flats to me because I have two dogs, Hindus and Christians refuse because I am a Muslim.” 
 
 He says that his celebrity status hasn’t helped him. “I keep assuring people that no parties will be held at my place. In fact, I have hosted just one get-together at my current apartment in the past six months. The saddest part is, house owners don’t even agree to meet me. There is no broker who I have not approached. They just inform me that the deal has fallen through either because of my pets or my community. I am tired of it now. I don’t want to move out of Bandra because I have been a Bandra boy and have a social circle here,” he signs off.
