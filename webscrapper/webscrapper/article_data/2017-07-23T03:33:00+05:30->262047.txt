Nagpur: Center Point School (CPS) in collaboration with Institute of Counsellor Training Research and Consultancy, Delhi (ICTRC) is organizing a regional summit of school principals on ‘Guidance-Based Education — The Emerging Concept’ on Tuesday at its Wardhaman Nagar campus. Workshop aimed to help school principals gain a broader perspective about the field of guidance and counselling, aiding the better administration of minimum guidance programme in their respective colleges.

 Representative of the summit VS Ravindran, said, “Children spend most of their formative years in school and the task of bringing them up as mentally healthy individuals falls upon the school. For this, the school authorities have to take a second look at their guidance and counselling services. However, due to paucity of professional counsellors, majority of schools in the country do not have even a part-time counsellor. Even in schools where a counsellor is appointed, not much is achieved.”
 
 Ravindran further added that all teachers need to become an integral part of the school guidance and counselling programme for the overall development of the child.
 
 Keshav Singh, another representative, said, “Schools across the city, and the country, have to adopt the philosophy of guidance-based education and for that it is essential that the school principals develop a conceptual view of the field of guidance and counselling so that they can give leadership and proper direction to the programme. The beneficiary of the programme are the students, teachers and principals and the effect on the students' future will be amazing if implemented with utmost care.”
 
 Keshav further added that the summit is also a platform for the school principals to share their experiences, ideas and thoughts for institution’s development. 
 
 CPS officials added that the main objective of the workshop is to increase commitment towards emotional health of the students and impart real knowledge.
