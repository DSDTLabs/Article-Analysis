PANAJI: A few cases of   (KFD) or monkey fever, have been detected but the   (DHS) expects a spurt in the next two months as   gets in full swing.

 The directorate is still continuing with its immunization programme in Sattari taluka where the disease was first detected in 2015. Since then, three people had died of the disease and over 277 cases were reported. 
 
 Dr  , state epidemiologist said that very few cases f KFD were detected so far. But he foresees a spike in the number once people start going into cashew plantations for harvesting. The first case of this season was detected in November 2016. 
 
 Sattari taluka has large tracks of cashew plantations and people who work in these plantations are exposed to KFD infection which spreads through a monkey tick, a vector of the disease. 
 
 Despite the precautions asked to take while cleaning and pruning cashew plantations, many workers don’t comply. “Many find it cumbersome to go fully covered-up to work in the plantations, especially, when it is so hot and humid. Also, village folks are not used to wearing boots. 
 
 Villagers laugh when we tell them to wear boots,” said a health worker, who was involved in conducting awareness on KFD in Sattari.
 
 People still have reservation about the vaccination programme though the situation is far better now than when the process started in 2015. Vaccine doses are spread over a period of five years, but many don’t turn up for the subsequent doses after the initial one or two doses. 
 
 The DHS now issues cards to people mentioning the dates on which they have to report to the health facility for the next vaccine dose.
