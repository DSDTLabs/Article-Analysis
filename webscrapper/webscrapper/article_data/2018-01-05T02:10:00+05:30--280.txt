 According to Met and   ( ) officials, the decline in air pollution is a result of sunlight and slight increase in wind speed. “Despite a foggy day, the PM2.5 levels came down as there was a slight rise in wind speed. Also, Wednesday witnessed better sunlight, leading to a dip in concentration of particulate matter ,” said an official of the Met department. 
 
 He added the PM2.5 concentration was expected to reduce further as wind speed was likely to rise, but fog might prevail on Thursday. “We have been taking all measures to control dust emission. We have asked the authorities to strictly impose the ban on garbage burning,” said an official of HSPCB.
