Visakhapatnam: The AP Tourism authority is coming up with a unique ‘Container Cafetaria’ on Vizag-Bheemili Road near Erra Matti Dibbalu on a two-acre land. 

 Themed on port   terminals, the   would have glass casing for a sea and landscape view. Parking facility and gardens would be part of the Rs 2 crore project.
 
 Work on the uniquely designed restaurant has commenced and is expected to be completed by November. Apart from Haritha hotels at Rushikonda, this will be the only restaurant of the state tourism department.
 
 Speaking about the designs, executive engineer of APTDC S V Gangaraju said, “The concept is that of a container terminal but entirely with glass windows for a panoramic view of the sea and open gardens. The building, done in conformity with Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms, is a non-permanent structure with ground plus first floor. The restaurant would be 70 feet by 90 feet with parking and gardens around on the sprawling two-acre land. The land levelling work has already been completed.”
 
 “For the project, the state tourism department has sanctioned Rs 2 crore. The plans and drawings by engineers have been laid. Next 3D elevation drawings have to be prepared. We hope this kind of a restaurant would be a hit with the tourists and visitors as there are no such stand-alone restaurants with a great view along the Beach Road,” said Gangaraju.
