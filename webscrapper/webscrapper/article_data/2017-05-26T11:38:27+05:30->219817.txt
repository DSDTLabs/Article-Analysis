BHOPAL: The National Green Tribunal ( ), which is hearing a petition filed by former minister   against “illegal sand mining in four districts”, asked him why he hadn’t broached the issue even once in the last 10 years. Patel’s counsel replied that the issue had come before them only recently. 

 During the hearing, NGT specifically asked why the issue was not disclosed during Patel’s tenure as minister. His counsel Ayush Dev   said, “When Patel was minister, officials did not give him the right picture. Today, he is not in the seat and can move easily anywhere and people are providing him evidence.” 
 
 Later, asked about the green tribunal’s query, Vajpai told TOI that it was “a normal reaction by NGT during the hearing”. “Such issues are being raised to deviate from the real issue. Patel wants to unearth a major issue in the form of sand mining,” the BJP veteran’s lawyer said. Patel’s counsel has demanded a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the issue. Notices have been served on the state government and 14 other respondents over the petition, he added. 
 
 State counsel   said, “Patel’s petition has no concrete evidence. Besides, there is no meaning of forming an SIT on this issue.” On the notices served on the government, Verma said, “It is routine practice. It is just a general notice.” 
 
 Patel has alleged in his petition that sand mining by private companies has caused irreparable damage to the environment. Illegal sand mining is rampant in Harda, Hoshangabad, Dewas and Sehore districts despite instructions from the chief minister for a clampdown, he says, adding that the “mining mafia” is using the latest technology to excavate sand from the river bed. “A syndicate of illegal miners and some government officials is working against environment norms and we have decided to draw the attention of NGT,” he said. The state government banned mechanised sand mining earlier this week.
