SANTINIKETAN: Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina on Friday chose the backdrop of the   campus to seek India’s help in repatriating Rohingya refugees to  .

 
 Over 11 lakh Rohingyas had taken refuge in Bangladesh, Hasina said at the inauguration of   in the presence of PM   and Bengal chief minister  . “We could not have turned them away. We are a nation of 16 crore people. Why could we not feed a few lakh more mouths? If need be, we will share our food. But we also want them to be expeditiously repatriated to Myanmar. We (Bangladesh and India) have to urge Myanmar to take its people back,” Hasina said.
 
 Modi didn’t refer to the Rohingya issue in his speech, but Bangladesh foreign affairs minister Nurul Islam Nahid said both counties were on the same page. His junior minister, Shariar Alam, pointed to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj’s recent visit to Myanmar, where she had expressed the need for the safe return of Rohingyas and even extended help to rebuild villages in the Rakhine province. 
 
 Modi and Hasina were present at a bilateral meeting after the inauguration, but diplomats from both countries corroborated that the Rohingya issue figured in it as the refugee problem had turned into a humanitarian crisis.
 
 India has refused to let in the Rohingya refugees, with some in the central government branding them a threat to national security. Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress, however, has differed with BJP’s stand, with Banerjee expressing her sympathy for Myanmar’s persecuted minority last year. “We support the UN appeal to help them. We believe all commoners are not terrorists,” Banerjee had tweeted in September 2017.
