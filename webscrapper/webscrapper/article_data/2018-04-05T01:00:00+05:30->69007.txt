Sangram could not be contacted, but a source said, “Three months ago, Sangram got married in Amritsar. It was an arranged marriage. His wife   is a VAT consultant in  , so he has decided to move there. The couple will be in Punjab for a few months before they finally relocate to Norway.”
Sangram’s close friend actor  , who is also a part of Yeh Hai..., said, “I am going to really miss him. Sangram has many of his family members settled in Norway and he wants to join them in the family business. He is a very good friend and we have already made plans to visit him for New Years.”
