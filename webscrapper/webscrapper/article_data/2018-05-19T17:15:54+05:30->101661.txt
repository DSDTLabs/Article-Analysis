BENGALURU: Hailing as 'historic' the decision of the Supreme Court asking the BJP government to seek a trust test on Saturday itself, former CM Siddaramaiah on Friday came down heavily on Governor Vajubhai Vala for having invited   to take oath as chief minister, despite him lacking the numbers.

 
 “What Vala has done is unconstitutional and undemocratic. Yeddyurappa had asked for seven days to prove his majority but was given 15 days. What inference can one draw from this? It is clear that Vala is acting on instructions from PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah,” Siddaramaiah said, after participating in the Raj Bhavan Chalo programme organized by the   here on Friday.
 
 Accusing Modi and Shah of disregard for the Constitution, Siddaramaiah alleged that Congress MLA from   had been kept in captivity by BJP leaders. “They are resorting to all sorts of things to woo our MLAs. They are contacting our MLAs. We have proof of it,” he said, claiming that all Congress and JD(S) MLAs are united, and will defeat the trust vote.
 
 AICC general secretary   also welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court. “The verdict has proved that there is rule of law in the country,” he added.
