NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday   50 more shops operating from   at  . Nearly a month ago, 51 establishments had been sealed for non-payment of conversion charge and “misuse of land”. 

 An SC-appointed monitoring committee inspected the market in the morning and ordered the sealing. Those affected include popular restaurants, cafes and shops like Moets, MB’s, Chique, Bansal Stationery, Kids Collection and Swagat. “We have sealed   operating from the basement for violation of Master Plan Delhi 2021,” said a senior corporation official. 
 
 The panel had directed the local bodies to collect conversion charges from 106 local shopping complexes by January 15, failing which they would be sealed. 
 
 The traders were agitated as no prior notice was given to the owners. 
 
 Jagdish Gupta, general secretary of Defence Colony market said, “We have no clue on what grounds the corporation is carrying out the sealing drive. When we ask them, they say it’s on the direction of the committee. We approached the monitoring committee but they refused to talk to the traders. The Supreme Court and government are bent on ruining our business. We are willing to pay the charges but the authorities are not listening.”
 
 He further said, “We had filed a petition in HC and SC but nothing happened. In the last week of December, 51 units operating from the first and above floors were sealed; today, they have shut the basements.” 
 
 Satish Gupta, owner of Kids Collection, said, “We are willing to pay the conversion charges at the notified rates. We even have the documents to support our claim and we visited the zonal offices on Janaury 15, which was the last date. But the corporation didn’t accept our dues.”
