NAVI MUMBAI: A class XII girl from   has been waging a lone battle running from pillar to post for two weeks after her mother went missing on March 30.

 As her father stays separately, Salomi Dsouza (17), has been spending her days visiting   and waiting at her home for her mother, Felciana (51), and nights staying at her friend’s house. 
 
 “On March 30 evening, when I was going to meet my friends, my mother asked me to take the house key along as she was to go to market. When I returned, she wasn’t at home, so I started calling her on her mobile phone, but it was unreachable,” said the only child of Felciana and Oswin Dsouza (51). Salomi registered an FIR at Vashi police station the next day.
 
 “My dad has been living separately in Vikhroli for years and visits us occasionally. He has made it clear to police that it would not be possible for him to stay with me,” Salomi added. 
 
 Felciana had filed a complaint against Oswin under the Domestic Violence Act some time ago. 
 
 Senior inspector Vashi Ajay Landge from Vashi police station said, “Investigations about the missing person are going on, but so far there has been no development. We have offered the girl to be sent to the children’s home but her uncle has taken her custody.”
 
 Oswin said: “I was not in contact with them for a couple of months until the night Salomi walked in saying Felciana is missing... My legal counsel has advised against staying together now.”
