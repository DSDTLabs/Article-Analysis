 "I'm really excited to have recorded the new album with a rhythm section and a string quartet. I have some songs I've always wanted to record with this line up and make into a very special album featuring this music I love. 
 
 "I grew up surrounded by orchestras and its music that is close to my heart. The new album features some standards, some unexpected covers and some of my own new material written especially for this project! I'm so excited," Costa said. 
 
 The album is the American singer-songwriter's first new material since her 2011 EP 'Pro Whoa', and her first full-length record since 2008's 'Pebble to a Pearl'.
