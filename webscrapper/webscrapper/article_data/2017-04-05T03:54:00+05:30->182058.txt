Chandrapur: An hour before chief minister Devendra Fadnavis landed in Mul and explained the measures being undertaken to bring financial stability in farmers lives, a debt-ridden farmer from village Bhandurni in same tehsil committed suicide by hanging himself to a tree located few kilometres away on Tuesday.

 The deceased, Umesh Mahadev Chaikate (50), was seen carrying a rope with him, while villagers were embarking vehicles to go to CM’s programme six kilometres away in Mul. Chaikate went behind the local Zilla Parishad school and hanged himself to death on tamarind tree at around 10.30am.
 
 His dead body allegedly remained hanging with the tree for few hours. Mul police, apparently busy in security bandobast of chief minister, came to remove the dead body only after CM went back, villagers have charged.
 
 Sarpanch Santosh Regundwar told media persons that he called the police immediately to inform about the incident but they came to spot at around 1.30pm to remove the body. 
 
 The farmer had three daughters and a son. He had obtained hand loan of around Rs60,000 from his relatives for his daughter’s marriage in 2015. However, he had failed to reimburse the debt. He shared one acre farm land with his two other brothers and worked as farm hand apart from tilling his land.
