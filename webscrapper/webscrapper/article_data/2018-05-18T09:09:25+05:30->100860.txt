CHANDIGARH: After Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) spent over Rs 2 crore on  , which the residents complained were of small size, for segregation of wet and dry waste, member of Parliament (MP) from the city   opined that the residents should buy their own dustbins.

 The corporation had distributed around 2.5 lakh dustbins -- two per house -- after the project of segregation of waste at source was launched by UT administrator and governor of Punjab V P Singh Badnore with much fanfare on June 5 last year. Dustbins were distributed free of cost to the residents which cost the corporation around Rs 2 crore. Despite spending huge amount, the project is yet to pick peace in the city.
 
 Chandigarh bagged the third spot in Swachh Survekshan 2018. The city is lagging behind on waste segregation and municipal waste management.
 
 While interacting with media persons,   said the corporation should shortlist outlets from where the residents can purchase bigger dustbins at controlled rates.
 
 A total of 462 tonnes of municipal solid waste is generated daily and 1,68,630 tonnes per annum in Chandigarh. Of the total, only 30% is being processed, while the remaining is thrown in the dumping ground. Chandigarh has 100% door-to-door collection in all its 26 wards.
 
 Kher and mayor of Chandigarh Davesh Moudgil thanked the residents for their efforts to keep the city clean after Chandigarh eamrged as the 3rd cleanest city in Swachh Survekshan 2018.
 
 Kher said they will continue the efforts to maintain the cleanliness and achieve 1st position in the next survekshan.
