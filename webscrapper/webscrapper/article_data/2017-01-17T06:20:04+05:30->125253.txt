“I ask people of Punjab if majority of their children or relatives are drug addicts. If it is not so then it is the Congress that is calling Punjabis as drug addicts for its own political gains,“ she said.
 
 Claiming that   leaders were trying to remove the blot of drug addiction on the state given by the Congress, Harsimrat said the Punjab government conducted dope test of nearly 4 lakh youth during recently concluded police recruitments and hardly 1.25% were found positive. “Yet, these Congress leaders say that 70% youths are drug addicts,“ she said. She said it was due to the bad name given by the Congress, they got dope test done on 10,000 youths during an Army recruitment rally and only 26 were found positive.
