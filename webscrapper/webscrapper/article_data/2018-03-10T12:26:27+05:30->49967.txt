TRICHY: Farmers from various organisations staged a protest against the BJP functionaries who allegedly attacked Desiya Thanninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam president P Ayyakannu while he was distributing pamphlets criticising the BJP-led union government in   near the collector office in Trichy on Friday.

 Condemning the incident, a group of farmers headed by the state organiser of the farmers’ wing of   A Nagarajan gathered in front of the collector office and raised slogans demanding action against the BJP functionaries.
 
 They also alleged that the BJP has been attempting to create unrest across the state by using derogatory words and criminal actions. Without considering the age factor of Ayyakannu, the district secretary of BJP women’s wing   had attacked him, Nagarajan alleged. He demanded that the state government instruct the district police to arrest Nellaiyammal and take further action.
 
 P R Pandian while speaking to reporters said that it was shocking to hear that Ayyakannu was attacked by BJP functionaries for distributing pamphlets. It was a condemnable one he said and added that the BJP functionaries were not mature enough to face criticism.
 
 A heated argument erupted between Nellaiyammal and P Ayyakannu outside the premises of Subramania Swamy temple in Thiruchendur when the latter was distributing pamphlets against genetically modified seeds and anti-farmers attitude of the Union government. Following the argument, both of them levelled assaulting charges of each other. A group of farmers headed by Ayyakannu are on a rally which commenced in Kanyakumari on March 1and is scheduled to conclude in Chennai, demanding better prices for agriculture commodities, pension for aged farmers. Genetically modified seeds were also on their demand.
