MUMBAI: A special trial court under the   (PMLA) has ordered that a non-bailable warrant (NBW) be issued against Dr  , the controversial founder of the   (IRF). The NBW is the first step for the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to proceed with seeking his extradition if he doesn't return to India. The order means that if Naik decides to come back to India, he will be arrested upon landing.

 The order, given by special judge P R Bhavke on Thursday , was on an application by the ED, which last year fled a case of   against Dr Naik and Aamir Gazdar, his confidant and director at some of his companies. The order mentioned that Dr Naik (who is an MBBS degree holder) “is presently residing in the UAE“. The ED said on Wednesday he was “directly involved in activities of funding and provocative speeches“.
 
 The ED says his absence is hindering its investigation. The case does not men tion an exact laundered amount, only that it is in “hundreds of crores“.
 
 The special court accepted the submission of the ED's counsel,  , that Naik had not responded to four summons issued to him in January and February to appear and participate in the probe. The court declined to hear Naik's lawyer, Taraq Sayed, on the NBW issue before passing the order, but took his plea on record that he ought to be heard. Venegaonkar said the application makes no men tion of his current location outside India or of his willingness to return to the country to participate in the probe.
 
 “As the foundation (IRF) is illegal and against the interests of the country , and social and communal harmony , the funds it receives from India and abroad are tainted,“ Venegaonkar had argued. “Companies were used to camouflage the diversion of funds received by Dr Zakir Naik through his illegal activity of making provocative speeches.“
