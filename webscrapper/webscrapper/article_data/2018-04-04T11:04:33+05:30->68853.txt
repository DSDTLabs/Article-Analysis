CHENNAI: IPS officer G Sampathkumar has approached the Madras high court seeking to restrain the BCCI from conducting the   2018 in the absence of preventive measures and infrastructure to prevent match fixing and betting.

 
 
 
 
 
 The plea moved as a public interest litigation (PIL) is likely to be heard by the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice A Selvam today.
 
 In the petition in which all the eight   teams including Chennai Super Kings are made as party respondents, the officer claimed that as an investigating officer from Chennai, he was instrumental exposing 2013 spot fixing and betting in IPL matches.
 
 
 
 “Contrary to the Lodha Committee report, vested interests still continue to be protected in the IPL and the questions of conflict of interest remain unaddressed by the BCCI,” Sampathkumar said.
 
 This apart, the BCCI do not have any system of accountability in performance of its anti-corruption unit and do not have database of earnings of its players nor about bookies, fixers and kingpins of illegal betting, according to him.
 
 Similarly, the BCCI do not have a preventive action or measure against a person committing the offence of sporting fraud in relation to a sport event like the IPL, where he directly manipulates or wilfully fails to perform to his true potential for economic or any other advantage, he added.
 
 The IPS officer said he was not seeking a ban on the IPL, but a credible system in place before commencement of the present season-11. He wanted the court to pass an interim order restraining the BCCI from conducting the game without bringing in such measures.
