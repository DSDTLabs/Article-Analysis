INDORE: Around three weeks after the   gave its permission to reopen the   at MY Hospital, the public works department and the hospital management are still trying to establish exactly who was responsible for the ‘technical glitch’ that caused the deaths of two children in May, 2016.

 The operation theatre was closed down after the children died because nitrous oxide was accidentally administered to them instead of oxygen.
 
 As wrong color-coding of nitrous oxide and oxygen gas pipelines surfaced as reasons behind the children’s deaths, MY Hospital,   and a contractor, who was assigned by the PWD to carry out ‘miscellaneous works’, started to play the blame game. 
 
 The court, while passing it’s order on an interlocutory application moved by hospital authorities seeking to re-open the OT, had put a condition forward that all norms for running the facility should be set in place before the facility is made fully functional again.
 
 To this, the hospital management approached the PWD for carrying out renovation work, including fixing gas pipelines, on January 30. After a week-long discussion, the PWD finally denied fixing the gas pipeline.
 
 “In January 2016, authorities had assigned civil works to the tune of Rs 5.5 lakh and electrification work worth around Rs 16.5 lakhs to PWD. As we were not assigned to installing the gas pipeline, we did not carry it out then and neither will we do it now,” said PWD executive engineer, Nirmal Shrivastava.
 
 PWD engineers however started renovation work on Monday. “PWD has started the renovation work. If it will deny fixing the gas pipelines, we will seek services of other experienced agencies/persons to carry out this work,” said MYH superintendent, Dr VS Pal.
 
 Meanwhile, the hospital administration will fumigate the premises and conduct a cultural investigation of the place before starting the facility.
