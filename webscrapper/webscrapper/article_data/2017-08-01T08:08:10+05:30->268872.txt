PUNE: A loving father and a soft-hearted guru who never differentiated between his children and disciples is how Anisuddin   remembers his father and guru,  , the exemplary   who passed away past midnight on Sunday. Dagar was 78. “The government did not acknowledge his contributions and he never got the apartment sanctioned from the government quota 27 years ago. Now, even if we get it, it does not make a difference because we have lost the light and spirit of our family,“   said.

 Dagar was one of the iconic seven brothers of the 20th generation of the Dagarvani gharana which revived and popularised the once-dying art of Dhrupad music.
