CHENNAI: A large portion of the Kathipara flyover in   was virtually covered in   in the wee hours of Tuesday after a minivan overturned and more than 35,000 eggs came tumbling down.

 The sticky yolk rendered the road surface slippery, particularly for two-wheelers, and traffic on the busy stretch had to be diverted. Police managed to restore normalcy after roping in a few   workers to dump sand over the affected portion.
 
 Police said the accident occurred around 2.45am and suspect that the minivan driver, Krishnakumar, might have dozed off at the wheel. The 26-year-old had picked up a load of 37,000 eggs at a wholesale godown in MGR Nagar and was headed to Nanganallur to deliver the consignment.
 
 As he got on to the Kathipara and was trying to negotiate a curve, he lost control and the minivan smashed into the median. In the impact, the vehicle fell on its left side. The rear door burst open and the eggs, tumbled out and broke as the racks were torn off.
 
 A few passing motorists and others rushed to the spot. They broke open the door of the driverâ€™s cabin and pulled Krishnakumar out before alerting police. A team of the   traffic investigating arrived and sent the injured driver to the government general hospital where he is recovering. 
 
 A case was registered.
