CHANDIGARH: Back in 2003,   department started a service to provide   on the safe   in   However, this is being highlighted as a new service initiated only now. The department, in its official release, claimed that the service had been initiated for the first time.

 The note released by PGI on April 30 said, “We, at drug information unit here in PGIMER, try our best to provide immediate authentic valid information on safe use of drug in patient management. 
 
 The service is flourishing very well and increasing day by day for PGI doctors. We hereby want to extend these services to all the doctors outside PGI also.“ However, when clarity was sought on how new the service is, official PGI spokesperson   said, “Service for outside doctors has been running since 2003. 
 
 It is just being extended to common people or patients so that they are aware of side-effects and other drug related information like timing of medications, any interaction with food etc. This is in view of rampant availability of drugs from chemist shops without prescription and associated troubles.“
 
 According to sources, the department of pharmacology proposed the drug information unit in 1999 and it was extended to those outside PGI in 2003.“This service has been since 2003 and was open for all doctors and community outside PGI. But the response has been not good,“ said Dr Promila Pandhi, former head of the pharmacology department, PGI. Interestingly , a study “Short communication Drug information unit as an effective tool for promoting rational drug use,“ which was published in 2013, relied on data from the drug unit. However, it was retracted next year after reports of data fraud as found by PGI's ethical committee.
