AHMEDABAD: Extending support to the central government’s ‘Housing for All’ programme,  , the apex body of private   developers, is planning to launch   projects across India through its members.

 This initiative of CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations’ of India) aims to create a considerable inventory of affordable housing so as to enable consumers and its member developers to take benefit of various government incentives announced for the segment as well as tackle the shortage of housing in the country.
 
 “We have set out to establish a model and accelerate the affordable housing segment, especially in the post-budget scenario where the demand for the same has been highlighted and incentivised,” said Jaxay Shah, who will take over as the head of the apex body at ‘CREDAI National Investiture Ceremony 2017’ to be held at Mahatma Mandir in   on April 9.
 
 These projects will be launched under the purview of various CREDAI state or city chapters according to the criteria laid down by CREDAI-National. “Our members from across the country will unveil 250 affordable housing projects during the ceremony in Gandhinagar,” added Shekhar Patel, treasurer, CREDAI-National.
 
 The ceremony will be inaugurated by Union minister for housing, urban development and urban poverty alleviation M   in presence of   chief minister Vijay Rupani and deputy chief minister Nitin Patel.
 
 “The real estate sector has seen its share of ups and downs in the past two years. With RERA, GST and Demonetization, 2017 is marked as one of the most crucial years for the sector,” said Getamber Anand, president, CREDAI.
 
 “Realizing the potential of the real estate industry, CREDAI is mobilizing its member developers to join the ‘Housing for All’ mission,” the realtors’ body stated in an official statement.
