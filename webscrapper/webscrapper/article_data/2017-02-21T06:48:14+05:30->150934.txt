NAGPUR: City police chief K Venkatesh, who is spearheading the security plan for civic polls on Tuesday, said antisocial elements are being sent out of the city by local cops under Criminal Procedure Code 151 (1) (3) via court orders until the counting process is over. As the police action continued, more than 200 goons had been rounded up by Monday.

 Even as the cops were busy streamlining their security bandobast, there were some anxious moments on the eve of polling when tension erupted at Naik Talao locality in Tandapeth. When BJP leader and union minister   tried to meet some of his party  , two groups almost come to blows. It’s learnt that Gadkari faced stiff opposition and his vehicle was also targeted. Police had to use mild force to bring the situation under control.
 
 CP Venkatesh said goons accompanying some candidates are being targeted considering their crime history, police records and past cases, especially election related offences. “Some critical spots have been identified where there can be a law and order problem. Police are spread across the city, but there is special focus on certain locations, where extra manpower has been deployed,” he said. “Sweeping raids are also being conducted against illegal liquor and firearms and police have already made substantial seizures,” he said.
 
 Joint CP Shivaji Bodkhe is learnt to have issued strict instructions to ensure that shops and establishments are closed by 11pm. The senior police station in-charges have also been told to ensure that citizens do not gather on the roads, pan or tea kiosks after 11pm. “Except outstation travellers and medical cases, citizens would not be allowed to assemble anywhere,” said a cop.
 
 Senior police station in-charges, under zonal DCPs, have been asked to remain on duty and marshal force for the next 24 hours. CP Venkatesh and Joint CP Bodkhe, along with zonal DCPs and ACPs, would be out for daylong vigilance.
