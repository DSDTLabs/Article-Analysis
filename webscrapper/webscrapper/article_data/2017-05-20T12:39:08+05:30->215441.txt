AURANGABAD: The   on Friday acquired a 13,000 sqft land from the   Development Corporation (MIDC), paving way for building the proposed 100-bed   in the city.

 The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ( ) had been scouting for suitable land for the hospital for quite some time. Some of the people’s representatives, including Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsat, were insisting the authorities to develop the hospital in Satara Devali while others were demanding that it should come up near the open space in Kranti Chowk.
 
 Sikander Ali, executive engineer in the civic body, told TOI that the MIDC has handed over an industrial plot near Ambedkar Nagar slum to the AMC. “The land is now reserved for the 100-bedd hospital that the municipal body has planned to develop,” he said.
 
 The AMC bought the land from the MIDC at a nominal price. However, the process of the land acquisition on Friday was not smooth as the authorities had to face the wrath of encroachers occupying the land.
 
 To build the hospital, Aurangabad guardian minister   has announced financial assistance of Rs 4 crore through district planning and development committee (DPDC), while the civic body will contribute Rs 2.5 crore. The total project cost is estimated at Rs 7 crore.
 
 Ali said the civic body would also raise the remaining funds which will be utilised for beautification of the site.
