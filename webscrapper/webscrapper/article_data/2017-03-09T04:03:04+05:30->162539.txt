NEW DELHI:  , Mathura Road, has withdrawn a circular it had sent to parents of Class VI students, asking them to make appropriate curricular changes considering the Central Board of Secondary Education’s “new language policy”.

 After the circular was issued on March 2, parents pointed out to the board that the school was planning to implement a policy that was still at the proposal stage with the ministry of human resource development.
 
 Acting on the complaints, a   was sent to the school, following which a new circular was issued on March 8 withdrawing the earlier document. 
 
 A senior CBSE official said, “When the issue was brought to the notice of the board a team visited the school and as the school was intimated that CBSE had not issued any notification on language policy as mentioned in its circular dated March 2, the school withdrew the circular unconditionally and regretted it. The school will follow the existing scheme of CBSE.” 
 
 Under the plan in question, a student will have to take up three Indian languages listed in schedule VIII of the Constitution, one of which can be English. All three languages would be main subjects in the Class X board exams.
 
 Students could study a foreign language, or a non-listed Indian language, as an additional subject, which would be non-qualifying in nature. However, the plan was shelved later, so that it would not affect the current set of students. A senior HRD official had told TOI that even if the new plan was approved by the ministry and CBSE starts working on the scheme it would not "happen before 2019-20".
