Antoine   is back in negotiations with Universal Studio's to helm   reimagining. 

 Reportedly, the studio was earlier in talks with 'Bright' helmer   to direct the project but he left it due to scheduling conflicts.
 
 In January last year, Fuqua had left the director's chair over scheduling conflicts with 'The Equalizer' sequel. 
 
 The most recent script for the film, which will be set in Los Angeles, has been penned by Joel and Ethan Coen, Jonathan Herman, and Ayer, who wrote Fuqua s 'Training Day'. 
 
 The new 'Scarface' will be produced by Dylan Clark for his Dylan Clark Productions and Scott Stuber. 
 
 Martin Bregman, who produced the 1983 original, will also return to produce again.
