KOCHI: The road development projects envisaged in the  's (GCDA) budget are expected to ease the traffic in the city. Chathiath-Pachalam­ Mamangalam Road, which is proposed in the budget, is expected to ease traffic in the arterial   as both the roads would be running parallel.

 The GCDA in the 2017­ 18 fiscal has earmarked Rs five crore for the development of the road. The road with a length and width of 4.69 km and 15 m to 20 m respectively would also help those from Vypeen to go to Aluva side avoiding traffic snarls on Banerjee Road. Given the fact that there had been efforts from the government and local body to widen Chathiath-Pachalam-Ma mangalam roads, it didn't work.
 
 The   will have to identify and sort out the issues that stood in the way of implementing the earlier project and sort it out.
 
 The Rs 204.60 crore budget which estimates the expenses at Rs 166.54 crore and a surplus of Rs 81.06 crore also gives thrust on infrastructure and housing. The housing schemes introduced by GCDA in the previous years have proven to be a flop. As the former chairman rightly pointed out, the GCDA authorities are still unable to sell out the studio apartments at Kakkanad and six apartments in South junction so far. Whether the GCDA can compete with the private realtors is yet to be seen. It will require imagination and will power on the part of administrators to implement various projects like   township project, housing scheme for slum dwellers, Rameswaram housing scheme, shopping complex at Kakkanad, women's hostels and multistoreyed shopping complexes with office spaces and film screens at different parts of the district. The budget proposal for constitution of a dedicated cell to maintain assets records of the Authority also is a welcome move.
