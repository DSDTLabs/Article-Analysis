The event will aim at making people aware about the benefits of Indian   over breed dogs. The event is also aimed at educating people about tackling dog bites.

 There almost 30 Indian breeds of dogs which will be put up for adoption. “Our motto will be to spread awareness about Indian breeds of dogs and motivate people to adopt them too as they are low maintenance. We will be trying for the   of some of the Indian breeds of pups in the event,” said Meenakshi Mahapatra, one of the volunteers from Panchkula Animal welfare association. 
 
 “Dog bite instances have been too much in the limelight this year. Hence, we are looking forward to make people aware about how to avoid dog bites,” he said.
 
 Talking about why one should prefer Indian dogs, Mahapatra said, “The anatomy and physiology of stray dogs is best suited for Indian climatic conditions, as compared to pedigree dogs. As a result, the frequency of falling sick is much less. Less fur on their body ensures that they shed negligent amount of hair. Most importantly, they are low on maintenance as they don't require much grooming like brushing, shampooing or special dog food and tonics like pedigree dogs.”
 
 “Last time, we had around 40 Indian pups available for adoption but only nine were adopted. We are hoping that this time many more will find permanent homes,” Meenakshi said.
 
 The event is the second in the year being organized by the same volunteers. They had earlier organized an adoption drive on February 5 in Sector 5, Panchkula by the same name, ‘Adoptathon- Low Maintenance Designer Dogs
