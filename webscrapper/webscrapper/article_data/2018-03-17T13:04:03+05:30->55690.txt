Aurangabad witnessed a nostalgic moment when students of 1983's 10th batch came together for a   after 35 years. These were students from   in Aurangabad. 
More than 100 students attended this event. These students were together in touch on a   group. They however decided that merely staying in touch online is not enough and finally hosted this reunion.
