Some people had also alleged that powerful people of the state were behind the rape and murder who were not being arrested. The police have, however, denied these allegations.

 After Tuesday nightâ€™s murder, Himachal Pradesh chief secretary V C Pharka said that the cops deployed on night duty at the Kotkhai police station have been suspended. The Kotkhai SHO and jawans have been sent to the police lines. 
 
 A magisterial probe into the killing has also been ordered. Sources said senior officials responsible for the protection of the accused too could be suspended.
