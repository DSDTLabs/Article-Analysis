 Currently, commuters find it difficult to walk out of railway stations due to scores of autos plying on share auto routes and causing traffic snarls in the vicinity.
 
 The state government is now keen on fighting the menace posed by illegal autos. State transport minister Diwakar   has already stepped in, directing all RTOs to rein in drivers of illegal autos from this week and impose hefty fines.
 
 Raote has also asked the officials to confiscate the illegal autos, wherever possible although RTOs face the problem of parking the impounded vehicles. In 2017, Raote had announced a scheme for those plying without permits to get their autos “regularized”, seek new permits. The scheme that was valid till March 31, received an “unenthusiastic response” and just 210 drivers applied for the new permits, said a senior official from  . “This is the reason why we are now cracking a whip on illegal autos,” he added.
