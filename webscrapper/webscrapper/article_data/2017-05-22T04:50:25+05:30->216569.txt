NAGPUR: The   (NFK) Club got an exclusive opportunity to learn the   organised by well known theatre actor Sanjay Waliokar at  , near Empress City on Saturday.

 The workshop aimed to boost confidence of the children and reduce their stage fear. 
 
 The session kicked off with a general discussion about the world of acting. Children's knowledge spectrum was limited to only Bollywood actors and directors.
 
 Discussing the hard work behind the success of actors, Waliokar said that some actors born with the gift but most of the actors learn the art through hard work. “Acting has a very vast horizon but it is a complex art and proper guidance is required to learn it,” said Waliokar. 
 
 As the workshop progressed, Waliokar demonstrated different types of emotions played by an actor and children followed suit. 
 
 Sensing children’s excitement, Waliokar asked them to prepare a play and present it. The children were divided into two groups and were given themes of market and police station for the play. 
 
 A beautiful chaos took over the hall as children improvised dialogues and practised different emotion. 
 
 Highlighting the importance of team work, Waliokar emphasized that while performing any scene the story is the hero and not the actor.
 
 Manpreet Sond, one of the parents, said that the workshop helped kids come out of their comfort zone. 
 
 NFK member Sannvi Singh said, “I loved the drama session. I learnt the importance of improvisation and how a single emotion can affect a scene.”
