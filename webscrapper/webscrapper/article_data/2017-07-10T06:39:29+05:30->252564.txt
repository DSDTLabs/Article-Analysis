VIJAYAWADA: To protest against caste discrimination in the state, the   unit of the   (Marxist) would beg on the streets across the state on July 13.

 CPI(M) state secretary and former MP, P Madhu, here on Sunday referred to the ostracism faced by the Dalit families at   of West Godavari district and the denial of temple entry to Dalits in Chittoor district. He said that the two incidents have revealed the real state of affairs in the state and the complete failure of the government to protect the rights of the people, particularly the Dalits. 
 
 He said that the official machinery in West Godavari district had failed to resolve the issue despite Dalit and civil rights organisations holding protests across the state.
 
 He also drew attention to Chittor where Dalit artists have been part of the   shows for decades. However, of late, the artists are not allowed to enter the temples here. He claimed the restrictions are being imposed and implemented by the castist forces. 
 
 The CPI(M) leader regretted that the government had failed to remedy the two incidents and the other similar incidents reported in different parts of the state. He appealed to the people to join the CPI(M)â€™s protest on July 13.
