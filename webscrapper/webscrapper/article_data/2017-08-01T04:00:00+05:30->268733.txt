Vadodara: More than a month after the state government faced major embarrassment after school bags with photograph of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav were distributed to students in Chhota Udepur during Shala Pravesh Utsav (school enrolment drive), the district panchayat got new bags for distribution.

 The district panchayat procured new bags from the same Surat-based vendor who was allegedly responsible for the gaffe in June.
 
 When the school bags were distributed during the first round of Shala Pravesh Utsav, some parents removed a sticker on the bags using a thinner only to see Yadav's photo on it. After the row surfaced, the education branch of district panchayat had decided to recall the bags distributed. They also did not distribute bags during the second round of the annual school enrolment drive.
 
 “We have got back around 90% of the bags distributed earlier and after we get all new bags, we will distribute new bags among the children,” said district primary education officer Mahesh Prajapati.
 
 On Monday, first batch of 12,000 school bags were delivered by Surat-based firm Chhotala Safety Products which had earlier delivered the bags with Yadav’s photo on it. Prajapati added that the firm was ordered to deliver the bags at no extra cost since they had committed the error earlier.
 
 The firms owner Zinabhai Chhotala, who had cried conspiracy by business rivals, had earlier said that he had procured bags from Delhi-based suppliers and had supplied them at short-notice. The district panchayat had also formed a committee to investigate the matter and it was decided to penalize the contractor but a formal decision is yet to be taken, said Prajapati.
 
 The new bags which will be distributed among the students of class I now has name of education branch of district panchayat written on it in Gujarati.
