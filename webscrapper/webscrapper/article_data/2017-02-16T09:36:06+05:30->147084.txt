NEW DELHI: BSF has seized fake Rs 2,000 notes that display a degree of sophistication that could pass initial scrutiny, leading security agencies to suspect that Pakistan was attempting to replicate the new currency. 

 The first such major consignment of 100 fake Indian currency notes of Rs 2,000 denomination was seized in   on Wednesday. Top officials in  ,   and BSF said Pakistan had activated its fake currency smugglers in Bangladesh and Nepal and consignments of fake notes, mostly in Rs 2,000 and Rs 100 denomination, were being moved in. 
 
 BSF and NIA stumbled on the conspiracy on Tuesday when they arrested a Malda-based FICN smuggler Umar Faruk with three fake Rs 2,000 notes. 
 
 An officer said the notes had some replicated features like colour, texture, electrotype watermark, see-through feature, year of manufacturing, Swachh Bharat and Mangal Yaan logo. But the notes have not been able to match features like Gandhi watermark, security thread, 100% cotton paper and embossing by insertion of Intaglio images. 
 
 “If you touch the fake note, you notice the quality is not like original notes,” said the officer. On the seizure, sources said a suspected smuggler on the Indian side was set to receive the bundle from the Bangladeshi side but he “managed to escape taking advantage of the darkness and thick growth in the orchard”. 
 
 “The packet, flung from across the border, landed in the orchard and it was recovered by the BSF team. This is the biggest seizure of fake currency post-demonetisation,” an official said.
