MUMBAI: If Kings XI Punjab’s Andrew Tye (4-0-16-0) did an immaculate job in pegging back Mumbai Indians’ scoring rate at regular intervals,   pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah struck at crucial junctures to give the home team a win by three runs in their door-die Indian Premier League encounter at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.

 
 
 
 
 Kings XI Punjab’s run-machine KL Rahul tried his best to shepherd the team through but his 94 (60, 10x4, 6x3) went in vain as the visitors finished at 183-5.
 
 That Mumbai reached a competitive score of 186-8 was largely due to the efforts of   and Kieron Pollard. Had it not been for the duo’s 65-run partnership for the fifth wicket and the cameos by opener Suryakumar Yadav (27) and Ishan Kishan (20), Mumbai would have struggled to get to a score that they eventually posted.
 
 
 
 Whenever Mumbai got a start, they were pegged back by the fall of a wicket. Wily medium-pacer Andrew Tye, who finished with figures of 4-0-16-4, was the man responsible to keep Mumbai in check time and again. Tye accounted for Yadav, Evin Lewis, Kishan and Krunal to keep his team in the contest.
 
 Sure, Mumbai were finding runs comfortably, but it was their shot selection which proved to be their undoing. From 37-0 in 3 overs, Mumbai slumped to 71-4 in 8.2 overs.
 
 It was Pollard, who replaced JP Duminy in the playing XI, and Krunal who gave momentum to the innings. After settling down, Pollard started calling the shots. Of course, he got away with a few edges, but he looked compact during his 23-ball 50. Krunal, on the other hand, looked a bit rusty and though he scored a 23-ball 32, his knock wasn’t convincing. The Pollard-Krunal partnership was broken when Pandya mistimed a pull off   and was caught at short fine-leg by Ankit Rajpoot.
 
 Pollard, meanwhile, got to his half century, but was soon out caught at widish mid-off by Aaron Finch off the delivery of Ashwin. Hardik Pandya then became Tye’s fourth victim, making only nine.
