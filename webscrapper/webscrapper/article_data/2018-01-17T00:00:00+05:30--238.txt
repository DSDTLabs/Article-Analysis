A woman’s clothing has always been subjected to scrutiny, especially at times when she has been violated or sexually harassed, when often it is her outfit that is blamed. In a bid to offer collective healing to   who’ve experienced   or assault, Blank Noise, a  , is organizing #INeverAskForIt on January 21 in Cubbon Park. One of the highlights of the   will be victims bringing outfits that they were wearing at the time they were sexually harassed.

 Speaking about the event, Jasmeen Patheja, founder, Blank Noise, says that the garments represent the individual’s voice. “All the action heroes who have built the ‘I Never Ask For It’ project have said, ‘I feel safe when we are heard. I feel safe when I am not judged. I feel safe when I don’t have to justify, defend or explain myself over and over and over again’,” says Jasmeen, adding that by having such events, they aim to create insights and a path for people looking at collective healing. “We are motivated by the conversations it would take to build this together — by the personal and collective healing it could offer. We are also motivated by the idea that building #INeverAskForIt calls each of us to step into our potential towards being another person’s safe space,” says Jasmeen, adding, “This is why we are creating circles of listening or speaking only if ready.”
 
 With campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp — that speak about sexual harassment across the world — how does #INeverAskForIt help people, we ask? “#MeToo has led to a new collective awakening — that all women have, at some point, experienced sexual assault or abuse. Each person who said #MeToo recalled a time in their life when they felt violated. The #INeverAskForIt project is a long-term commitment, built through public and community engagement, participation and collective ownership,” says Jasmeen, adding that in the coming months there will be more such events across the country.
 “We envision 10,000 garments facing sites of public significance by 2022. There will be more street interventions and projects built across sites, places and communities in the coming year,” Jasmeen sums up.
