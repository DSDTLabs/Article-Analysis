Jaipur: Caste certificates of all the reserved category students will now be provided at school level. Social justice and empowerment department issued orders to all district education officers (DEOs) for giving these certificates in V standard.

 This decision will be a major relief for parents who had to run from pillar to post for getting   for their wards. Officials claim that the move will ensure that no student from reserved category is bereft of reservation benefits and schemes running for them.
 
 “All children from scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, other backward classes and special backward classes will get caste certificates from the school itself. We have set V standard as the upper limit by which each student who belongs to  ,  , OBC and   should have that document,” said an official.
 
 The school head or principal will get the documents collected from all the SC and ST students and also other than SC and ST students and arrange to submit them to the relevant state government authority or revenue authorities for making the requisite certificates.
 
 The concerned revenue or state government authorities will scrutinise those documents and issue the relevant certificates within a period of 30-60 days.
 
 So far, parents have to visit the office of sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) or tehsildar to get their wards’ caste certificate vetted. In many instances the certificates are not issued till students reach X standard. Also there have been complaints of delay in grant of scholarship to students belonging to SC and ST.
 
 Besides, citizens have often complained of harassment allegedly by government officers in getting domicile and caste certificates issued. However, with the new arrangement students will be able to avail all benefits of the reservation without any hassles.
