SALEM: A police head constable, who demanded a liquor bottle from a few drunken youths to let them go scot-free, was on Tuesday transferred to control room from the   police station.

 According to an official source, Muthu Kumaresan, head constable attached to Kannankuruchi police station, found a few youths consuming liquor near Chettichavadi area in the city, where he was on patrol duty, on Sunday night.
 
 Muthu Kumaresan subsequently held an inquiry with them and threatened to register a case against them for consuming liquor in the public place. The scared youths pleaded with him not to take any legal action against them. Muthu Kumaresan then demanded a liquor bottle to let them go scot-free. The youths bought a liquor bottle from a nearby liquor shop and handed it over to him.
 
 One of the youths, however, videographed everything in his mobile phone and published it in the social media such as WhatsApp and Facebook.
 
 The city police commissioner, K Shankar, who came to know about this issue, on Tuesday transferred Muthu Kumaresan to control room and also ordered a departmental inquiry against him.
