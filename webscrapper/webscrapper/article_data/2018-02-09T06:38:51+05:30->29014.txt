KOLKATA: Thousands of daily commuters were left in the lurch after autorickshaws plying between   and Garia went off the road on Thursday in protest against the arrest of Iman Ali Khan, who allegedly molested a passenger on Wednesday evening.

 Buses ran packed and seemed too little to cater to the surging crowd as hundreds waited for hours at bus stops. 
 
 A mother who tried to take her 13-day-old toddler for a check-up at a hospital, an actor who was to attend a shoot around noon, several school students out to take their exams and IT executives who had to attend meetings were among many who suffered. No auto plied on the route during office hours and services resumed only around 7.30pm.
 
 "I once had to jump out of an auto near Malancha a couple of months ago when the driver tried to molest me. I might be late to work today, but I can never support shutting down of the route," said a media professional who did not wish to be named.
 
 Kanchan Kirti, a school student, complained how she had missed both her tuitions and was getting late for her school. "This is the first time that I had to travel in such a crowded bus,"she said. 
 
 The bus stops along the route were bursting at the seams. "All the auto drivers had done was put up a board saying they were suspending operations for some specific reason. This is the fourth time they have done this in a year. Now that I know the reason, I find it extremely repulsive that they can actually support such an act," said Avik Banerjee, a chartered accountant.
 
 Strangely, even as the   auto union distanced themselves from the incident, their secretary Bitan Haldar kept flip-flopping on his comments. "We will take action against him. But the charges made by the woman are impossible to be done by a man who is driving an autorickshaw," claimed Haldar.
