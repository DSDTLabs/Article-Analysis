MUMBAI: Agripada police probing the death of 32-year-old   who got sucked into the MRI machine at   have summoned the radiologist to record his statement. 

 Maru’s family members had raised concern about the radiologist being left out of the FIR. “Four people were present there. There was a doctor from the radiology department too...Why was he not arrested?” asked Yogesh, Maru’s brother. 
 
 A police officer said, “We have issued summons to the radiologist. His statement will be recorded to understand the sequence of events.” 
 
 For Maru’s death, caused by excessive inhalation of oxygen, police arrested Dr Saurabh Lanjrekar, ward boy Vithal Chavan and attendant Sunita Surve for negligence causing death. They were later released on bail. 
 
 Dr Lanjrekar told police he was in the console room and the radiology department resident doctor, Siddhant Shah, should be held responsible for the incident. Police sources said they have learnt that Shah had asked the patient’s relatives to remove their jewellery and metal objects and went to the console room before the incident.
 
 On Wednesday, police wrote to the private firm that supplies oxygen cylinders to the hospital to send a technician to de-attach it so that panchnama can be conducted. “The cylinder will be seized,” said senior inspector Savalaram Agawane. Maru’s severed finger is yet to be removed from the machine.
