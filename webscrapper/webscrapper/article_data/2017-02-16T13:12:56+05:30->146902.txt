PUNE: Falling for the same old trick, a 65-year-old   lost Rs 1.40 lakh to  , who he befriended on social networking site   in January this year.

 The Chatushrungi police have booked a London-based woman and a man from India for allegedly duping retired judge   of Senapati Bapat Road of Rs 1.40 lakh. “The duo duped Patil on promise of providing him with medicines to cure diabetes. The Indian suspect has been identified as Rajesh Verma alias Farooq Mirza,” sub inspector N M Palampalle of the Chatushrungi police station told TOI.
 
 As per police, the suspects exchanged their phone numbers with Patil on on February 2. “While chatting online with Patil, the suspects told him that they had a cure for diabetes. They also told him that the medicines were expensive and selling for the double the price in the European market,” Palampalle said.
 
 After Patil showed interest to buy the medicines, the suspects asked him to deposit Rs 1.40 lakh in their bank accounts, which the retired judge dutifully did without verifying their credentials. “When the medicines did not arrive after waiting for days, the retired judge tried to contact the woman from London, but all in vain,” Palampalle said.
 
 The retired judge registered the complaint against the duo after the Indian suspect abused him when he contacted him over phone. 
 
 “We have taken down the details of the suspects along with their Facebook profiles. So far, we suspect it to be a case of Nigerian fraud. Further investigations are on,” the officer said.
