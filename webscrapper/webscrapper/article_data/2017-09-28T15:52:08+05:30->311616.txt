With mythological shows doing extremely well, actor   who is playing the character of   in Swastik productions’ Mahakali–   has been receiving a lot of appreciation.
 
  “Shumbh has been one of my most favorite characters. It wasn’t easy to become Shumbh and therefore it was a challenge that I was willing to take on. The differentiation that you need to bring in a character for a mythological show is extremely crucial. I was sure of adding some variety in my diction and on improvising the tonality of my dialogue delivery. I’m glad that the viewers accepted me in this avatar.”
  
  On being asked about the show doing well, Abhaas adds, "The entire crew puts in a lot of effort to making the show a success and we succeeded. Also, the story is gripping and the entire cast is brilliant."
