GURUGRAM:   were left red-faced after burglars struck at a   challan branch and fled with nearly Rs 5 lakh cash and hundreds of impounded driving licences and registration certificates of vehicles.

 The break-in took place late Wednesday night in the traffic police challan branch office, adjoining the office of ACP (Manesar), in the tehsil building. However, no arrests have been made in the case yet.
 
 “The challan amount and the impounded documents of vehicles are the responsibility of the challan branch staff. 
 
 We are conducting a departmental inquiry and action will be taken against anyone found responsible for carelessness,” police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Police sources, however, said that a cop who kept the challan money in the branch before leaving for the day, has already been suspended for dereliction of duty. 
 
 “Some other cops in the challan branch are also under the scanner,” sources said.
 
 According to sources, the burglars broke the window panes of the challan branch to gain entry. They stole Rs 4.85 lakh challan money, apart from the impounded driving licences and registration certificates. Interstingly, the theft took place despite the deployment of a night watchman at the branch.
 
 On the complaint of a challan branch cop, an FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under sections 457 (house breaking) and 380 (theft) of IPC at Manesar police station. However, police seem to be clueless even after two days of the crime.
 
 A senior police officer who did not want to be named said the challan branch cops were to be blamed for carelessness. “After collection of challan amount, it is the responsibility of the branch personnel to keep the money safe,” he said.
