Manali: A massive landslide near Muling in Lahaul valley at about 12pm blocked the Manali-Leh highway, bringing vehicular traffic to a complete standstill.

 According to sources, Border Roads Organization (BRO) is engaged in widening of the highway and has to cut the sharp mountain face in the region, about 10km before Keylong. The mountain face here became unstable and collapsed on the highway.
 
 Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Deva Singh Negi said the highway has been blocked following the landslide. “The highway may open by Sunday night. There is no alternative road so the travellers on road will have to cooperate,” he said.
 
 The landslide is huge and BRO has pressed its men and machines into service to remove the debris and reopen the highway for vehicular movement. The landslide has also impacted traffic on Keylong-Manali and Udaipur Manali route. The Manali-Leh highway is officially closed for vehicles from October 15. Important supplies to Ladakh are also sent through this road to stock for consumption of local residents and military before snow blocks the road.
