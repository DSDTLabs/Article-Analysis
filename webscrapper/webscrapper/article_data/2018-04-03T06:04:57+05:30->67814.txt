KOLKATA: The resolution professional for   on Monday submitted a revised plan by Vedanta to the   (NCLT). The submission came after the committee of creditors rejected the argument of Renaissance Steel that both the Anil Agarwal-led firm and   are not eligible to bid under clause 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),  

 In a twist to this ongoing battle, the Dalmias-led Renaissance again filed a petition on Monday, challenging the decision of the creditors' panel. The next hearing in the case is on April 4. It is also learnt that Vedanta has upgraded its offer to around Rs 4,900 crore from Rs 4,500 crore in the revised bid that was submitted on March 29. Vedanta's earlier offer was already the highest.
 
 In his submission before a division bench comprising Justices Jinan K R and Madan Balachandra Gosavi, Renaissance Steel's counsel Ratnanko Banerjee said, "We are opposing the committee of creditors' decision on eligibility of Vedanta and Tata Steel. We are also opposing the resolution plan (of Vedanta)." Later, Banerjee told TOI that Renaissance is filing two applications challenging the creditors' decision that both Vedanta and Tata Steel are eligible bidders.
 
 The Dalmias-led Renaissance had alleged that both Vedanta and Tata Steel were not eligible to bid under clause 29A of the IBC as one of its provisions says a company that has its executives convicted for any punishable offence with an imprisonment of two years or more under the Companies Act would not be eligible to apply. The Dalmias have claimed both Vedanta and Tata Steel come under this criterion.
 
 However, Vedanta counsel Siddhartha Mitra said the company was not violating clause 29A as there was only a penalty and no imprisonment of any executive in a Vedanta sister concern in Zambia.
