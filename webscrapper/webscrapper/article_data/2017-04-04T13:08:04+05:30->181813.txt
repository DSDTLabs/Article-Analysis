It’s not often that two singers render two versions of one song and both are retained in the film. But this is what has happened for the Junglee Music album 'Begum Jaan’s' 'Prem Me Tohre'. 

 The 83-year-old legend, Asha Bhosle’s, sheer power over the classical nuances in this track is what has lent a soulful and evocative feel to the song.   who has sung the other version, says, “This is a melodious song and I’m honoured that I got the opportunity to sing the same song that   has sung and that too for the same film. She has a certain magic in her voice that is difficult to match up to.” 
 
 Kausar Munir’s lyrics showcase the conflicts and predicaments faced by sex workers in a poignant way.
 
 'Prem Me Tohre' might just be Anu Malik’s best after ' ' (' ').
