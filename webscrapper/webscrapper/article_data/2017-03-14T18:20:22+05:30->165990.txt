HYDERABAD: The public transport system appears to have taken a back seat in the budget. The much-needed Metro Rail project did not figure in finance minister   speech. Similarly, there was no mention about multi-model suburban rail transport. 

  But a 200 crore loan for Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited and 1 crore for MMTS were shown as grant-in-aid funds. 
 
 The Metro rail expected to start on the Miyapur to SR Nagar this June, requires about 500 crore for payment of compensation for land, shifting utilities. The government, however, sanctioned only 200 crore, that too in the form of a loan. In the 2016-17 budget, HMRL got 200 crore against the 400 crore it had asked for. Sources said the government did not earmark funds as L&T got two more years to complete works. 
 
 "HMRL is taking a loan of 230 crore from Andhra Bank. The government will stand guarantee for the loan," a senior HMRL official said. 
 
 With regard to MMTS phase II, the South Central Railway has already started work. Tellapur to RC Puram stretch (5.75 kms) is expected to be commissioned by December 2017. SCR general manager Vinod Kumar Yadav said that the entire MMTS phase-II project is expected to be completed by December, 2018.
