MUMBAI: Following an expose of   in Uttar Pradesh allegedly trying to shortchange customers, the   in Mumbai has appealed on Monday appealed to the public to check physical delivery at any petrol pump in the city. 

 Twenty-three people from Uttar Pradesh were arrested on Saturday for using some chips in fuel pumps to allegedly dupe people fuel buyers. 
 
 President of Petrol Dealers' Association, Ravi Shinde, said that the chips manipulated the flow of petrol, thereby shortchanging buyers. "It is possible only by tampering the seal of the weights and measures department. Every dispensing pump is sealed after verification, and tampering is possible only by breaking this seal or in connivance with government officials," said Shinde.
 
 He asserted that consumers have a right to check the authenticity of fuel delivery at any pump. "To verify delivery of quantity, you can tell the manager to dispense 5 litres into a 5-litre conical measure, but it should not be done too quickly. The meter reading should be reset at zero and the five litres dispensed from the pump should fill up to the neck of the conical measure," said Shinde.
 
 Another association member said that consumers can also inspect the seal of the weights and measures department to ensure that it is intact and has not been tampered with. This member said that one can complain in writing in a book provided at the petrol pump or call the sales officer whose mobile number is displayed at all pumps in the city. Alternatively, citizens can also call up the weights and measurement department and lodge a complaint against the pump.
 
 Another dealer said that when people go to a pump, they should try out these verification methods. "  has to percolate to every customer, without which incidents like the one in UP will keep happening."
