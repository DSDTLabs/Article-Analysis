CHANDIGARH: War of words has erupted between Haryana sports and youth welfare minister   and Congress MLAs over the issue of alleged unkept promises with Olympian medallist woman wrestler Sakshi Malik.

 Raising the issue in the state assembly on Tuesday, Congress MLA Karan Singh Dalal questioned the role of the Haryana government towards sportspersons and asked it to clarify its position on the allegations levelled by Sakshi’s mother Sudesh Malik.
 
 Replying to the query, sports minister Vij said the state government had not broken any promise and all facilities and cash award were provided as per the rules to Sakshi, who won a bronze medal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
 
 “The chief minister gave her a cheque for Rs 2.5 crore the day she landed in India after the Olympics. The post of director of sports at Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, has been created. All formalities for her recruitment would be completed in a meeting to be held this month,” he said.
 
 The minister said the government had released Rs 75 lakh to the Rohtak deputy commissioner, for installing airconditioning system in the hall where Sakshi practised. “Sakshi should have applied to the Haryana Urban Development Authority ( ) to get a plot which she did not do. Congress only endeavours to mislead the people,” said Vij.
