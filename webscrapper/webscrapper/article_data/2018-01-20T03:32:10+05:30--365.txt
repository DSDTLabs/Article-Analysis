MUMBAI: The Bombay high   on Friday directed a medical board of J J Hospital to examine a woman on her plea to allow her 22-week-old foetus with a rare congenital heart disease to be aborted.

 A bench of Justice Ravindra Borde and Justice Rajesh Ketkar heard a petition filed by the woman, a resident of Pune who is currently in Mumbai. She has urged the court to allow medical termination of her pregnancy as she is barred, in spite of the diagnosis of foetal abnormality with negligible chances of survival, by the law that does not permit termination beyond 20 weeks.
 
 Her advocate Meenaz Kakalia submitted that for the first time on January 5 during ultrasonography, it was detected that the foetus with gestational age of 20 weeks 3 days has a structural cardiac anomaly – truncus arteriosus with atrioventricular canal defect. A foetal echocardiography on January 16 confirmed the diagnosis of the congenital heart disease and other anomalies. Kakalia said the prognosis states that with these congenital defects the child would require multiple surgeries in stages and the first two would have to be done within the first two months of birth. "All these operations are high risk and even if they are successful, the baby would not have a normal life span or quality of life,’’ she added.
 
 The judges said it will be desirable to refer the woman to be examined by the medical board comprising the dean, heads of department of gynaecology, and professors or heads of paediatrics, radio, neurology and any other expert. They directed her to appear before the board on Saturday and also, that the board “shall sensitise the petitioner as regards the pros and cons of such procedure beyond 20 weeks.’’ Directing the board to submit its report in a sealed cover, the judges posted the next hearing on January 25.
