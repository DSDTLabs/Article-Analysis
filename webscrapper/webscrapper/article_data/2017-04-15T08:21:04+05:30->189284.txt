PUNE: Two parks coming up in the heart of Baner are set to fulfil a long pending demand of   residents.

 One park is located near   opposite  , and the other is adjacent to Dot Fitness gym. Spanning over almost 2,000 square metre each, the two parks shall have a host of services to offer once ready, including walking plazas, gazebos and children’s playing area, among others. Both parks will have a dedicated corner each with fitness equipment for all. A meditation area and a small library are also part of the plans for each. The parks will also have cycle parking lots and toilets.
 
 The two parks are designed to be inherently self-sustainable. Rainwater harvesting system has been incorporated in the design and special perforated pipes will be used to put excess irrigation water back into the ground. A solar panel will take care of the electricity requirements of the parks.
 
 Project manager Sanjay Kumar said, “This is an initiative of the  . We aim to complete the work by the end of April.”
 
 “A space for fresh air and to relax is a rarity in our area,” pointed out Sanjeev Singh of Baner   Residents’ Association ( ). “Baner is fast turning into a concrete jungle with hardly any fresh air. Parks like these will help to boost the health of the locals. We hope more such facilities will be planned to cover a greater area,” he said.
 
 Balewadi resident Ashish Agrawal said, “It’s heartening to see the government using technology for public works. We, as citizens, should support such work.”
 
 BBRA is also planning a signature campaign in member societies for naming the parks in memory of martyred soldiers. It has already tweeted to the PMO about the same.
