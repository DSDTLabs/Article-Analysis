LUCKNOW: The rift that appeared within Ambedkar Mahasabha after announcement of 'Dalit Mitra' award for CM  , widened on Friday when its founding members sent a letter to the CM Yogi accusing his government of ignoring Centre's directions on setting up special courts to hear cases of   atrocities in the state. 

 In their letter, the founding members cited a notification (number 268) issued by Government of India on April 14, 2016 vis-a-vis constitution of a special court and appointment of a prosecutor for cases of Dalit atrocities. "The need for a special court was felt in the wake of rising number of crimes against Dalits," founding member  , a retired IAS officer, told TOI. The letter, signed by 12 founding members, also recalls a meeting of a delegation led by SC/ST commission member   with Yogi in July 2017 vis-a-vis Centre's notification and constitution of special courts. "But the government never abided by Centre's direction even as atrocities on Dalits increased," he said. The founding members had earlier questioned the credibility of incumbent president Lalji Nirmal and claim that they were 'not aware' when he became president. "It is therefore requested not to get associated with any such award which has been constituted illegitimately," the members said.
