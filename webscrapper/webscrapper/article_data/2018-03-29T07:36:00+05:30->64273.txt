CHANDIGARH: The irrigation and power police station arrested   unit chief of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for his alleged involvement in electricity theft on Wednesday. AAP leader   was sent him to judicial custody till April 12.

 Investigating officer (IO) Sukhwinder Singh said   had allegedly defaulted on the payment of Rs 74,189 as fine slapped by the   (DHVBNL) team, which detected an illegal kundi (hook) connection used by him in February. According to information, Virender was taken into custody when a police party headed by Sukhwinder had gone to   village to arrest one person who, too, was booked in a case of power theft.
 
 Virender had an argument with Sukhwinder and his team. The team had arrested the defaulter. Virender walked into Sukhwinder’s office and had a fresh round of arguments with him. Meanwhile, one of the cops informed the IO about power theft case, which had been registered against Virender earlier this month.
 
 “Soon after learning this, we took out his case file and asked him about the status. As and when we called, he would always say he was ready to face the arrest but would not pay the bill,” said Sukhwinder.
 
 The officer said Virender was among those who had been misleading others to not clear the dues of the electricity and irrigation department. “Soon after his arrest, he was produced before the duty magistrate in Sirsa, who remanded him to judicial custody,” the IO said.
