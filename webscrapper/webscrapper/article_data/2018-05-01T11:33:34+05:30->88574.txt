BENGALURU: Pollsters have predicted a hung assembly but C fore on Monday foretold an absolute and clear majority for the ruling  , with 118 to 128 seats.

 
 As per the C fore survey,   will get 63 to 73 seats, with JD(S) coming in third with 29 to 36 seats.
 
 The survey data states that the poll prediction exercise was carried out in 61 of the 224 assembly segments, with 6,247 voters being interviewed. C fore says the survey is said to have an error margin of 2 percentage points and 95% confidence level.
 
 The survey says Congress will make heavy inroads into Bengaluru, a BJP bastion, by winning 17 to 19 of the 28 seats, and BJP securing only 8 to 10 seats. The BJP currently has an edge, holding 13 of the 28 segments.
 
 Except for central   districts of Davanagere, Shivamogga and  , all other divisions including Bombay-Karnataka, Hyderabad-Karnatak, coastal Karnataka and Old Mysuru region are supposed to favour Congress.
 
 The central Karnataka region survey hints at the   issue not having had much of an impact for Congress. It suggests that 45% of youngsters in the 18-25 age group are said to favour Congress, thereby hinting that PM Modi’s “magic” with the youth is on the wane. Also, 47% of the women are said to favour Congress, apparently on the back of its populist schemes like Ksheera Bhagya.
