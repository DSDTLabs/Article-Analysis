GURUGRAM: Coming down heavily on the real estate developers, the state government has again issued notices to ten more developers for violations under Real Estate Regulation Act ( ) second time in a week. Last week the state had come out with the first list of the violators under the act.

  These developers have been issued notices under the section 3 of Central Real Estate Regulation Act (CRera), which states that no developer can advertise a project for sale unless registered under Rera,” said a senior government official. The advertisements were rolled out between May and April.
 
 There has been continuing confusion on whether the clause of not advertising without registration pertained only to the new projects or it also covers the existing projects. Director general, Department of Town and Country and Planning ( ), Arun Gupta, who also heads the Haryana Rera committee did not respond to calls or messages despite multiple attempts.
 
 The Union ministry had issued a notification stating that a developer cannot advertise a project unless registered under the act irrespective of a new or existing project. The Section 3 of the central act states that ‘the promoter can advertise his project for sale after the project has been registered with the regulatory authority.
 
  Also, the promoters of all on-going projects which are yet to receive completion certificates need to register their project with the regulator authority within three months of its commencement. 
 
 Developers, on the other hand, are saying that there is still ambiguity over the clause as the union ministry had earlier said that the developers can advertise till 31 July.
