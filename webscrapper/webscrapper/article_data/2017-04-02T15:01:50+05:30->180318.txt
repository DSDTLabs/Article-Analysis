KOLKATA:   put up a very convincing display to beat   3-0 in their rescheduled   encounter at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium here on Saturday. Mohun Bagan skipper   scored two goals while striker   got the other goal.

 The green and maroons' playmaker   also had a very impressive outing. The Haitian might not have scored but he assisted all the three goals scored by his team. And, Sony Norde feels this was Mohun Bagan's best performance in the I-League this season.
 
 "We were good in all departments of the match. We attacked well and we also defended well. I think this is the best game Mohun Bagan have played in the I-League this season. We hope to carry on with the same level of performance in the remaining games. I am happy to help my team," said Sony Norde, who reached Kolkata in the early hours of Friday after duty with the Haiti national team.
 
 Mohun Bagan are now in the third position on the I-League table with 26 points from 13 matches, four points behind leaders Aizawl FC but the club from Mizoram has played a match more. The green and maroons are one of the favourites for the title but Sony Norde feels there is still some way to go as all their five remaining matches are difficult encounters.
 
 "We still have five difficult games to play. If we can win four and draw one, then it should be good for us," said Sony Norde.
 
 Mohun Bagan's next I-League game is the Kolkata Derby against arch-rivals   at the Kanchenjungha Stadium in Siliguri on April 9. Sony Norde is hopeful of Mohun Bagan putting up a good show and underlined the importance of winning that match. "If we play like we did against Bengaluru FC, we will be able to put up a good performance against East Bengal. If we can win that match, we will be 70 to 80 per cent through towards becoming champions," added Sony Norde.
