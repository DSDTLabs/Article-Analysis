MUMBAI: Two new-age non-life insurers — Acko and Digit   — have received the final approval from the insurance regulator   to do business in India. Both companies are relying on their technology platforms to differentiate themselves and plan to replicate the e-commerce service experience that customers are used to.

 Acko is a digital-only, non-life company promoted by Varun Dua, founder of online insurance brokerage Coverfox and backed by Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures. Digit Insurance is started by Kamesh Goyal, former head of   in India, and is backed by the Fairfax Group. Dua said that Acko will adopt a risk-based pricing for retail covers such as motor and health insurance as against the flat pricing strategy followed by incumbents. Acko plans to start selling insurance by December.
 
 Digit has already raised Rs 350 crore, which is one of the highest capital that any insurance company has commenced operations with in the country. Acko is starting with a paid-up capital of Rs 200 crore, 48% of which comes from foreign investors. Digit insurance said that it will be introducing its products and services in the next four-six weeks in the Indian market — initially through strategic partners.
