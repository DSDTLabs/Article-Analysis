Romantic numbers in Tollywood are fewer in number compared to the peppy party songs that the industry churns out. 
But they leave a bigger impact on the audience. In the first edition of the Hyderabad Times Hotlist 2017, Hamsa Naava from  : The Conclusion, topped the charts in the Best 
 Romantic Numbers category. Picturised on Tollywood’s hottest on-screen pair Prabhas and Anushka, the song was crooned by Deepu and Sony. Some of the other songs that made it to the list include ‘Unnatundi Gundey’ from  , and ‘Nee Kallalona’ from Jai Lava Kusa. Interestingly, though Ram Charan-starrer   hit screens in 2016, the song ‘Choosa Choosa’ continued to rule the roost in 2017 and made it to the top 10.
