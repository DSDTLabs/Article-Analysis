NEW DELHI: Markets on Thursday opened higher after getting a boost from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers which registered a growth of 7.2% in the October-December quarter of 2017-18, the fastest growth in five quarters.

 
 The benchmark   edged 42 points higher at 34,226 and the broader   stood above the 10,500-mark. Asian shares were mostly lower as sentiments got dragged down by a slide on Wall Street.
 
 At 11:24 am, the BSE index was trading 89 points or 0.26 per cent lower, while the   index moved below the 10,500-mark.
 
 Major gainers that supported key indices include Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors and Bharti Airtel, rising up to 1.70 per cent.
 
 A mixed trend in other Asian markets influenced investor sentiment here, traders said.
 
 The Sensex dropped 162.35 points to close at 34,184.04 on Wednesday as inflation worries resurfaced following comments of new US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
 
 Also, banking stocks led by Axis Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank took a hit after the finance ministry set a 15-day deadline for banks to take pre-emptive action on operational and technical risks, following a $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank.
