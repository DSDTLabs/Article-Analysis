NAVI MUMBAI:   and cars in the city on the eve of   this fiscal was more than last year despite buyers having to pay a road safety tax of 2% on the total tax amount. 

 Vashi deputy RTO Sanjay Dole told TOI on Tuesday, “This Padwa, buyers bought more vehicles even as the prices and the tax outgoing have increased. The registration of two wheelers and cars was better than last Gudi Padwa.”
 
 With Gudi Padwa falling in the end of March this year, many bought vehicles to get tax benefits. Last year, this option could not be availed by many as Guwi Padwa was celebrated in April, right after the end of the fiscal year, the deputy RTO said. 
 
 The number of two-wheeler registrations this year was more compared to cars, with 14 more   and 62 more   registrations. 
 
 The local transport offices were referring to vehicle registrations done a week ahead of Padwa as most buyers like to do a puja and decorate the new purchases with garlands on the festival day.
