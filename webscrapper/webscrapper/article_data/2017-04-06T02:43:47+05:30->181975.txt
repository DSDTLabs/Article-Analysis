NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( ) has admitted before the Delhi   that more than 500 sanctioned posts of special educators are lying vacant in   run by it in the city.

 “Of the 588 special educators posts, 553 are vacant. Similarly, 181 of 731 posts of nursery teachers and 802 of 8,244 posts of primary teachers are vacant,” SDMC informed the court in an affidavit filed last week before Justice Manmohan.
 
 HC is currently hearing a plea seeking contempt proceedings against the AAP government and corporations for their failure to comply with its earlier order to fill vacancies for 26,000 posts of teachers in their schools, which has affected the teaching process.
 
 In its affidavit, south corporation also stated that out of the total sanctioned strength of 588 principals for its primary schools, 126 posts have been vacant for months, even after the corporation wrote to other authorities.
 
 The reply came on a petition filed by   through advocate  . 
 
 The NGO had raised the issue of huge vacancies saying that there were “as many as 26,031 (excluding 9,000 posts created by the Delhi government in 2015) vacant posts of teachers” in the government-run schools and the three corporations.
 
 It had also alleged that there was “deliberate and intentional disobedience” of the orders of a division bench of the high court to ensure zero vacancy at the commencement of each academic year in schools in Delhi. 
 
 As per the estimates of the government, 1,011 government schools currently have a total vacancy of around 15,000 teachers. The NGO had highlighted that such a teacher-student ratio is abysmal by any teaching standards.
 
 Observing that despite the December 2001 direction of the division bench, many vacancies still existed in these schools and the petition said this was “resulting in depriving 25,05,691 students studying in 1,977 schools of their fundamental right to receive quality education.”
