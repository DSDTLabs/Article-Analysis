Panaji: Many students that answered the state board Class XII exam from the science stream in 2018 had got together to start online petitions and even held a protest outside the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education premises in Porvorim. This was the third time in recent years that students claimed that the Class XII physics paper was ‘unusually tough.’ Students had demanded ‘lenient paper corrections’ from the board. After the Class XII results were declared on Saturday, Goa Board chairperson Ramkrishna Samant said that the board’s stand that the physics question paper was of usual difficulty level, was vindicated. “Ninety-two per cent students have cleared the physics exam. So it proves our stand,” Samant said. The highest marks scored by any student this year in physics was 99 out of the total 100 marks. At the 2018 Class XII exam, other subjects like mathematics and psychology had higher failure rates than physics. The board, he said, got the physics paper evaluated after the complaints and found that neither were there any out-of-syllabus questions, nor was the paper of unusual difficulty level, and so, there were no grounds to go lenient on the paper corrections. Samant said that as per the Goa Board’s format, around 13-15% of the question paper should comprise application-type questions or tough questions. He said that the physics question paper was found to meet this criteria, with a majority of the questions being of easy or average difficulty level, giving no grounds to students to complain.
