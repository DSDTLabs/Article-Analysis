THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government was aware of the shortage of lower denomination   and prompt measures were taken to circumvent the crisis, said finance minister   in the assembly on Tuesday. 

 
 To counter the shortage of stamp papers worth Rs 50 and Rs 100, government has taken steps to re-notify the value of available stamp papers of Re 1 to Rs 5 denominations as equivalent to stamp paper worth Rs 50. Similarly, stamp papers worth Rs 7 to Rs 10 have been re-notified as equivalent to stamp paper worth Rs 100. A notification in this regard was issued on February 14, he said.
 
 To end the artificial scarcity of stamp papers worth Rs 50 and Rs 100, government has also taken steps to share the available stock of such stamp papers among government treasuries. He was responding to a submission presented by   on the difficulties posed by the scarcity of lower denomination stamp papers.
 
 Chief minister   told the assembly that government will continue to pressure the Centre against the suspected move to shift the proposed coast guard academy from   to Baikampady in Karnataka.
 
 A letter in this regard was sent to the prime minister on January 6. It was in 2009 that coast guard decided to set up an academy at Azheekkal in Kannur and 164 acres were handed over for the purpose. The then Union defence minister had laid the foundation stone for the academy on May 28, 2011. Coast guard has so far spent around Rs 65.56 crore on the academy.
 
 Special permission from the Union ministry of environment was sought for carrying out construction activities in a portion of the land earmarked for the academy. However, the ministry has not yet given permission in this regard, he said.
