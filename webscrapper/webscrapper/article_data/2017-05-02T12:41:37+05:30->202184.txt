Stand up comedian Abijit Ganguly was in news recently after he accused popular comedian   of lifting jokes from his video and using them in his show. He has now posted a video titled, "Sleepless nights with Kapil," in which he is seen talking about all the 'Kapilians' trolling him on social media.
 
  In the video, Abijit says that Kapil's fans have been abusing him. He talks about all sort of things that he had not heard before. He also mentions how Kapilâ€™s fans tried to calm him down by saying, "So what if he lifted your jokes, at least he is spreading a smile."
  
  
 
  
  The video is hilarious and Abijit's take on the trolls will leave you amused. He also takes a dig at the famous comedian by saying that he posted about plagiarism in his senses. He was not drunk and did not tag the PMO for the same, hinting at Kapil's infamous tweet last year where he had tagged PM Narendra Modi.

  A few comments read: "Kapil ko kabhi plague nahi hua, usne bachpan mein hi teeka karwa liya tha (Kapil has never suffered from plague, he got his shots in his childhood)."
  
  
 
  
  It all started when Abijit noticed that Kiku had lifted one of his jokes for his performance on Kapil's Show. He posted about the same on social media, but received flak from   Sharma's fans, who call themselves Kapilians.
