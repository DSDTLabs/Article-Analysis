NAGPUR: Fire department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) has issued a notice to   asking it to remove all the 44 stalls on its premises by Monday else police complaint would be lodged against the owners.

 An official of   fire station said that these temporary structures were located on ground, first and third floor. “There are none on the second floor. These stalls sell toys, artificial jewellery, food items etc. There is no provision for them in the building plan,” he added.
 
 According to the officer, the stalls blocked the passage in the mall. “In case of a fire, people should have enough space to rush towards the exit. These stalls will create bottlenecks in such a situation,” he said.
 
 Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake will conduct an inspection of the mall on Monday. “If stalls are not removed by then we will take further action,” said the official.
 
 NMC had admitted before the Nagpur bench of   last month that it had found many illegalities and discrepancies in the construction of Empress Mall, including that of fire safety and unauthorized construction. NMC had conducted an inspection of entire structure on January 28. Accordingly, a notice was issued to   under Section 6 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006.
