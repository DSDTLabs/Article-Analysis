NEW DELHI: The   (GSTN) is a robust system capable of handling 1 lakh concurrent engagements and there is no need for repeated extensions regarding filing deadlines,   chairperson   has said. “The system is not deficient as it has a sufficient capacity to handle a large volume of filings. The number is close to 30 lakh for August and the system can do many more without being stressed,“ Pandey told TOI.

 There were around 72,000 concurrent users in the GSTN system on Wednesday around 2 pm and finally 81,000 filed in that hour. There were 49,000 concurrent users on Thursday around 4pm and 34,000 had filed in that hour. The statistics indicated that the system capacity was sufficient to accommodate the demands.
 
 Pandey , who is also CEO of the   (UIDAI), said GSTN is looking to address problems such as filing discre pancies relating to a particular section of traders or type of business or issues such as procedures for correcting incorrect filings. “We are moving to one system after a complex situation where states and the Centre had different tax regimes but we are actively offering solutions,“ he said, urging taxpayers to file in time without waiting for the last day. The GSTN chairperson explained that   had drastically altered the scenario where consultants used their familiarity with the tax administration system to submit returns and smoothen hurdles for business clients. “The system does away with the kind of interaction that involved a web of consultants.Now the human interface is gone and a new way of doing business is in place,“ Pandey said, reiterating that data was absolutely secure.
 
 The GSTN is now gearing up to deal with the process of matching invoices that will begin soon. There is anticipation that this will throw up a new set of teething troubles when sellers or suppliers do not enter a transaction and the receiver does. Here the onus will be on the recipient to pay the tax.
