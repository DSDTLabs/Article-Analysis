BHOPAL: Jagannath   often met Jagannath Kewat in this far-flung   village in MP’s Anuppur district. Their paths would cross almost every morning — one would go to work at South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) and the other to graze his cattle.

 
 For 34 years, the cattle grazer never had a clue that the man he and the entire village knew as Bheemsen Kewat had stolen Jagannath’s identity and job in the mines.
 
 Bheemsen enjoyed the status of a government employee, andwasenjoying a government pension when truth caught up with him, thanks to   card and Bheemsen’s ancestral property.
 
 Bheemsen was arrested for fraud on May 26, 2018, and is nowcooling hisheelsin jail. In the1980s, a job card was the ticket to government employment for illiterates. Jagannath had one, Bheemsen didn’t. When SECL started hiring labourers in 1982, Bheemsen took Jagannath’s job card and applied as Jagannath Kewat, say police.
 
 “Bheemsen joined as a badli majdoor (shift labourer) and retired as support mistry (technician) in 2016. His last drawn salary was Rs 52,708 in 2016 — quite a handsome amountin these parts.Andthe original Jagannath is living in poverty,” Bhalumada police station ASIRK Shukla said.
 
 Bheemsen livedthedouble life so flawlessly that no one had any inkling all these years. “He opened bank accounts, even made an Aadhaar card in the name of Jagannath Kewat,” said Shukla.
 
 “He did not change the name in revenue records for his land in his village as it would have meant that his ancestral property would not be transferred in his name. Similarly, in the Aadhaar card of his son, he kept his original name otherwise the land wouldn’t pass to his next generation. This was the first clue that led us to more evidence andwecaughthim,” hesaid.
