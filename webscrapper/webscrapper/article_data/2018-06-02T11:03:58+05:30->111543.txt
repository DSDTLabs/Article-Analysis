VASCO: The Mormugao Municipal Council has a unique peeve — women who pluck flowers from its garden. Chief officer Agnelo   has now issued a notice to the security guard and gardener not to allow anyone to touch the flowers.

 Fernandes said that women who go for an early morning jog or walk often carry plastic bags and, on their way back, pluck the flowers and the buds. “This is like raping the flowering plants and aborting the flowers, which can’t be tolerated,” he said.
