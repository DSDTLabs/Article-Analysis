CHHAPRA:  , which falls under Varanasi   division of North Eastern Railway zone and was electrified in 2012, is a Class A station generating a revenue of about Rs 14 lakh per day.

 However, the junction at the moment is overloaded due to the movement of about 75 pairs of passenger and express trains either passing or originating from here. There are only five functional   which are unable to cope with the load causing frequent stoppages of trains at nearby stations like   (Chhapra-Varanasi section), Tekniwas (Chhapra-Siwan section) and Chhapra Gramin (Chhapra-Sonepur section).”
 
 “There is an urgent need for additional platforms to facilitate arrival and departure of trains. Most of the arriving trains are stopped at the signal for want of platforms at the station,” said a source. Varanasi division PRO Ashok Kumar said that three additional platforms have been sanctioned for this station and tender for their construction has been invited.
 
 The approach road to enter the station premises has added to the woes to the passengers. The road is perennially water-logged and is littered with garbage.
 
 Chhapra MLA Dr CN Gupta said he has taken an initiative to improve the condition of this road and hoped that improvement would be visible after some time.
