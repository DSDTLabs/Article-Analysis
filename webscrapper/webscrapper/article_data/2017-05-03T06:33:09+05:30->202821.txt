CHENNAI: After a muck show in 2016 - when the city was 37th among cities the Centre surveyed, coming behind Trichy, Madurai and Coimbatore -   is keeping its fingers crossed ahead of Thursday's   announcement results, hoping for a better ranking on the back of   regarding the city's cleanliness. 

 Commissioned by the ministry of urban development, the annual Swachh Survekshan survey ranks cities by their sanitation levels.
 
 Chennai fared dismally last year on issues such as disposal and efficient processing of waste, construction of public toilets and households with individual toilets. Around 80% to 85% of Chennaiites gave the corporation's efforts the thumbs down on these aspects.
 
 On Tuesday, however, the ministry raised Chennai's prospects, and the corporation's hopes, by stating that local bodies across the country put up a better performance this time around. It said the Swachh Bharat Mission has made a "positive impact" on cleanliness of urban areas.
 
 "[The] survey results are very encouraging," Union minister for housing and urban poverty alleviation M Venkaiah Naidu said.
 
 Greater   deputy commissioner (health) M Vijayalakshmi said, "It feels like we have made an improvement," but did not elaborate on what fuelled this line of thought. Vijayalakshmi was Trichy corporation commissioner when the city grabbed the third rank in the country in 2016.
 
 She said Cyclone Vardah would not have impacted the results though the ministry carried out the survey in January and February 2017, less than a month after the cyclone struck the city, leaving behind huge piles of debris and garbage. Corporation regional deputy commissioner (north) Praveen P Nair said northern parts of the city have improved sanitation.
 
 But activist Dharmesh Shah said, it is time to move the narrative of the Swachh Bharat mission from cleanliness to efficient waste management. "Because while we clean our streets, we are still dumping garbage somewhere else," he said.
