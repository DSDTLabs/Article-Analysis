CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is planning to auction 66 residential properties. Out of these, 50 properties (located in Sectors 39, 41, 45, 47 and 63) are leasehold, while the remaining 16 properties (in Sector 49, 51 and 38 West) are freehold.

 The Chandigarh administration had recently allowed conversion of leasehold to freehold, after paying conversion charges. The administration calculated conversion charges of flats allotted by the CHB on a pro-rata basis (proportionate allocation according to share).
 
 The board has developed housing schemes in different areas like Sector 29, 41, 40, 44, 43, 45, 47, Sector 38 West and  , which have around 64,000 dwelling units. It has also developed rehabilitation housing schemes.
 
 Meanwhile, after receiving a poor response, the board has extended the last date of registration and e-bidding for its residential and commercial properties at the upcoming   Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP).
