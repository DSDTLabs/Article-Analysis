Nagpur: An elderly woman was robbed at her residence in Aaradhna Society, Mankapur, on Sunday at around 3.30pm. Two unidentified masked robbers, who claimed to be plumbers, tied 62-year-old Rudha Thakur’s hands with a long scarf and snatched her gold chain worth Rs40,000 before fleeing from the house. Rudha’s retired husband Ramanath (75) was helpless since he has been paralysed since three years. Mankapur police registered an offence of robbery against two unknown miscreants. Rudha had told her nephew, who works in Pune, to send a plumber to fix an underground water tank at their place. Accordingly, a plumber had visited their house last Tuesday. The plumber told Rudha he would send his assistants to complete the pending work. On Friday, two masked persons reached Rudha’s place and said they were plumbers. After looking around the house, and confirming that the couple stayed alone, they told the woman they would return on Sunday to finish the work. Accordingly, the duo accused, in the same attire, came back on Sunday and asked Rudha to take them inside. “One of the robbers then grabbed Rudha’s hands from behind and tied her with a long scarf. The other miscreant gagged her with the same veil. They snatched her gold chain and ran away,” said PSI Mithilesh Tripathi. Rudha somehow managed to release herself and alert neighbours, who summoned the cops. Since the duo didn’t take any other valuable, they were not habitual robbers, said the PSI. Cops said some 12 students reside on the first floor of the house, but all of them had left for home during the vacation.
