We’ve implemented this across ports in Norway, too, and have been using green shipping technologies widely.”
 
 The business delegation that is set to visit from Norway will also explore business opportunities in sectors such as waste recycling including biofuel and clean water technologies in addition to ship breaking technologies and research opportunities in pharmaceuticals.
 
 “Norway has widely implemented zero-waste technology and the same could be a major boost to Gujarat and India. There is a wide scope for collaboration when it comes to environment-friendly practices and technologies,” said Shailesh Patwari, president, GCCI.
 
 Ollestad said Norway is also looking to collaborate with educational institutes for higher education. “We would approach institutes like IIMA and IIT Bombay. We are looking at collaboration between universities in Norway and leading institutes in India over higher education at masters level programmes,” he said. “As part of the exchange, students will not just study in another country, but also take training at companies in the respective countries they’re visiting to get better work exposure and understand the business cultures of the two countries better,” she said.
