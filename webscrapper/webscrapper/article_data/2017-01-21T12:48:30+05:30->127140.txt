AURANGABAD: The visitors of the city zoo may soon have an opportunity to see zebras and giraffes as the authorities are forming a proposal to get the rare African species to the city.

 A team of zoo authorities recently visited zoos in Hyderabad and Vishakhapatnam to explore the possibility of bringing these animals from there. The team also studied the environment suitable for these animals.
 
 However, deputy municipal commissioner   — part of the team visiting the zoos — said it would not be feasible to shift zebras and giraffes from Hyderabad and Vishakhapatnam.
 
 “Only one pair of animals is there in these zoos. Thus, we cannot bring them here. Moreover, the wild animals are quite young forcing us to drop the idea. But we are certainly looking forward to arrange the animals from different places,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, sources told TOI the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation-run Siddhartha Garden is planning to bring a pair each of giraffe and zebra from foreign countries like Israel, Malaysia or Indonesia.
 
 The civic body will have to spend at least Rs 18 lakh to air lift these animals. Municipal commissioner   has already given his nod for the proposal. “These animals are popular among zoo visitors. If we bring these animals here, we will certainly see rise in the number of visitors. Moreover, being the tourist capital of the state, the city zoo should have wide variety of animals,” he said.
 
 It should be noted that the city zoo is already facing shortage of space and authorities will have to create a space of about 2 acre for these African animals.
 
 A senior officer in the zoo said space will not be a constraint. “We are planning to acquire space allotted for traffic garden and use it for the zoo. In addition to this, we are soon shifting two elephants from and thus their space can be provided to the new inmates,” he said.
