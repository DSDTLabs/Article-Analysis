PANAJI: Stating that   has remained stagnant for the last 25 years, St Cruz MLA Atanasio   alias Babush kicked off his campaign on Tuesday in the new turf after visiting the Mahalaxmi temple and Panaji church. 

 “Panaji needs a change. Give me five years and I will change the face of the city,” Monserrate said, after offering prayers at the Mahalaxmi temple. 
 
 Speaking about the ongoing alliance talks with the  , the three-time MLA, who is contesting from what is regarded as a BJP stronghold, said a tie-up was in the offing. “Talks are still on and we have been given a positive response. We have asked for a couple of seats,” Monserrate said. He added that he has asked for the Mormugao and   seats.
 
 Unfazed by the prospect of fielding a candidate from Cortalim, where future alliance partner NCP has already named its candidate, Monserrate said, “I also have a candidate from Cortalim. We will see what happens when the alliance is formed.” 
 
 In an indirect attack on defence minister  , who held the Panaji seat for two decades, Monserrate said, “I blame that person’s vision who held the seat for such a long time.” He added that if elected, he will ensure that one person from every household in his constituency gets employment.
