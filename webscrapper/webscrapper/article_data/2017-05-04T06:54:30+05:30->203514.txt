CHENNAI: The   department has summoned minister C Vijayabaskar’s wife Ramya to appear before it for questioning on Thursday in connection with the raids which took place on their premises on April 8. Ramya was present when I-T officials searched the minister’s residence on Greenways Road. Sources told TOI that there were many properties in the name of the minister’s wife and it was in this connection the summons were issued. 

 “We asked her to appear before our officials on Thursday but she said she had some work to attend to and sought to advance it to Wednesday. Based on this we asked her to appear at 2.30pm but she did not come at the appointed time. She has sought time and said she would appear on Thursday,” a senior investigation official told TOI. 
 
 Ramya has been summoned after the I-T sleuths collated the papers and documents seized from 72 places in Chennai, Trichy and Pudukottai belong to the minister, his family members and associates. “Ramya is a partner in several business ventures and in some she is a proprietor. In one of the sand mining business, she has a major role. Based on all these evidences we issued summons asking her to appear for questioning. The summons were only for her,” said the official. 
 
 In Chennai only   has been summoned so far for questioning and that too immediately after the raids. “It is nearly a month since the searches were conducted in the minister’s residence. But it always takes time to collate all the papers and other documents seized from various places. Our officials were also busy searching several premises of a famous chit fund company on tax evasion charges. These are the reasons for the delay in summoning her,” the official said.
