AHMEDABAD: The heart of a 20-year-old   on Tuesday in a 42-year-old woman from Surat in a private hospital of Ahmedabad.

 The 20-year-old youth,  , a resident of Kubernagar area in the city, had sustained severe brain injuries in a road accident on Saturday. Even after two   at a private hospital in Shahibaugh area, there was no possibility of his survival. He was, finally, declared brain dead. His family decided to donate his vital organs to someone needy and was waiting for it for long.
 
  
  Rekha Navadia, 42, was suffering from enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy) for the last 10 years. An enlarged heart’s ability to pump blood decreases because the heart's main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, is enlarged and weakened. In some cases, it prevents the heart from relaxing and filling with blood as it should.
 
 “Eight years ago, a pacemaker was implanted in her heart to enable it to continue pumping blood. But the pumping gradually fell to 15-20% of capacity. In such a condition, only a new heart can save her life,” said Dr Dhiren Shah,   surgeon.
 
  
  After Krunal’s death, his family members decided to donate his heart and it was finally transplanted into Rekha. The heart transplantation surgery was conducted on Tuesday morning after which the patient’s condition is stated to be stable.
 
 “This heart transplantation is important because, for the first time, the donor has come from Ahmedabad – a city which has a population of nearly 55 lakh but there had not been even a single donor. Besides, the heart came from a boy to a female recipient. This is also important,” Dr Shah.
