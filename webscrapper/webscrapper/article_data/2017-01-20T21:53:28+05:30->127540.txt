 “We are glad she has got the opportunity to attend the big event,” said Aditya Soma, CEO MunCafe, which organizes the HMUN India conference. Neogi is also coordinating with MunCafe in organizing a leadership event at Symbiosis School of Liberal Arts, Pune, where she is pursuing her bachelor degree in arts.
