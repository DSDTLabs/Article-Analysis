Directed by writer   and featuring music by the Bollywood duo Vishal & Shekhar, 
  charts the journey of Surya ( ), an army soldier with major anger issues. It's not long before he manages to push his superiors, including Colonel Sanjay Srivasthav (Boman Irani), past the point of no return with his irresponsible actions. While his adoptive father, whom he calls godfather ( ) manages to help him from getting kicked out the army, he must get clearance from famous psychologist Dr Rama Krishnan Raju (Arjun) to be reinstated. However, Surya and the doctor seem to share a troubled past.   is also introduced in the first half as Surya's ex-girlfriend Varsha who bears the brunt of his anger more than once.

 
 
 The first half of the film, which is engaging in parts, is eerily reminiscent of Mani Ratnam's 'Kaatru Velidiyai'('Cheliyaa' in Telugu) in parts, without any of the subtlety of the Karthi-starrer. Surya is in-your-face, rude and has no qualms about being the way he is, even when it costs him his love, friends and even his career. So far the film has seen the beautifully shot Sainika, beautiful Love and the super fun 'Lover Also Fighter Also' song come alive on-screen. However, the challenge that Surya takes up to keep his anger in check and a fight scene right before the interval hint at things getting a lot worse before they get better for Surya.
