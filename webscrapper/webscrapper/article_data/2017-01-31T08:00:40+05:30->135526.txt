JAIPUR: Close on the heels of death of a two-year-old girl   in Bhilwara, similar case has come into light when a one-year-old girl was rushed to   in Bhilwara after she was branded with hot iron rods by 'tantriks'.

 She was brought to the hospital a day ago with drowsiness along with pneumonia and septicaemia.
 
 Chief medical health officer (Bhiwara) Dr Jagdish Chandra Jeengar said, “The family belonged to Shahpura of  . When she was brought to the hospital, she had cross marks of rods on her stomach as she was branded with hot iron.”
 
 The doctors in MG Hospital said that the girl was drowsy and her condition was not stable. “We admitted her to the hospital immediately. She has pneumonia and septicaemia. Now her condition has improved,” Dr RS Shrotriya, principal specialist (paediatrics) said, who is providing her treatment. 
 
 He said that such incidents are common in Bhilwara due to ignorance and lack of awareness. “In a year, we receive at least 6-7 such cases of children branded with hot iron. It is a kind of custom and belief that children with pneumonia get branded with hot iron so that they will recover from the disease,” Dr Shrotriya said.
 
 On January 13, a two-year-old girl, was referred to Ajmer hospital in a critical condition as she was branded with hot iron rods by a tantrik in Bhilwara, but she died while undergoing treatment in JLN Hospital, Ajmer. She had pneumonia, but despite taking her to a doctor, her family took her to a tantrik who branded on her stomach with hot iron rods.
