BELAGAVI: Congress   may have dismissed all talk of leaving the party but his statements after the resignation of former chief minister   have stirred party members at the district and state level.

 Soon after  , Hukkeri had made veiled threats about quitting the party if Krishna was not convinced to reconsider his decision. After meeting energy minister D K Shivkumar, Hukkeri said he had no intention of leaving the Congress, but cadre say he has sent out a message — that the neglect of senior leaders will not be tolerated.
 
 Political observers say Hukkeri’s statement reflects the “suffocating environment in the Congress party” and a feeling of being side-lined by newer leaders.
 
 Hukkeri began his career as a gram panchayat member, and has been an MLC and a five-time MLA. He is now MP for Chikodi. Hukkeri was chief whip in the S M Krishna government. He was a minister in Dharam Singh’s government and was the district in-charge.
 
 After Siddaramaiah became chief minister, Hukkeri has lost a little ground. Despite being the senior partyman, it was Satish Jarkiholi, who is close to Siddaramaiah, and not him who was made district in-charge. Hukkeri was put in charge of Haveri district. 
 
 At first, he was assigned the relatively unimportant muzrai ministry and rebelled. Then, the sugar and small scale industries ministries were given to him.
 
 Experts say Congress will have to do a lot of hard work before the elections to unite its factions as well as broker peace between the old and new leaders withing the party.
