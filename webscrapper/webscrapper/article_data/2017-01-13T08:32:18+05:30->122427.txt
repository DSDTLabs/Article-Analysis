MUMBAI: A day after the   gave the Centre approval to take over underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s two properties in south Mumbai, tenants of the buildings said they would approach the court if they are asked to vacate.

  and  , in JJ Marg area, have more than two dozen tenants. 
 
 The tribunal declared the two properties as ‘illegally acquired’ and approved their takeover under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA). 
 
 Dawood’s youngest brother Iqbal kaskar resides on the fourth floor of Damarwala building. It is said to have around 24 tenants. However, when TOI visited it on Thursday, five rooms on the first floors were locked. “Most tenants have shifted out but continue their fight against the notices to vacate,” said Aliasgar Rangwala, a resident of the building, who has been handling the case on behalf of all tenants.
 
 “We have not received any order from the tribunal. My father, who is 89 now, was born in this house. We are protected through the tenancy rights and will vacate if we are provided alternative residence,” Rangwala said. 
 
 In 2002, a Tada court had said the building was owned by Dawood and ordered its attachment. Rangwala said, “All the tenants moved the court citing our tenancy rights. But we were never called to the court or heard.”
 
 Another tenant said, “The building was bought by Amina Bi, Dawood’s mother, and Kaskar from Abdul Hussain Damarwala in 1980s” 
 
 Rangwala said that in August 2015, they were issued notices under the SAFEMA to vacate. Then, 27 appeals were filed claiming long-term tenancy. The tenants have been depositing their rent with SAFEMA authorities since August 2015. On Wednesday, the tribunal rejected their appeal. 
 
 Rangwala said, “We had got a stay on the notice. The last hearing of SAFAEMA was on December 5, 2016. We were never called. How can one complete inquiry without hearing the other side?”
