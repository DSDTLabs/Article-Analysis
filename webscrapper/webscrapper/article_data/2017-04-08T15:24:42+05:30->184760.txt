 Bareilly: In an attempt to boost police department’s efficiency, deputy inspector general (Bareilly range) Ashutosh Kumar has asked his department to maintain digital record of all criminal elements booked at police stations for any offence. The pilot initiative aims at maintaining a digital profile of all criminal elements booked in any case for future reference.       “As of now, we have no proper profile of criminals at police stations which can be used to aid investigations. Victims can be shown profiles of such existing criminals and may be able to identify a perpetrator. The situation gets aggravated when a cop well versed with the criminal elements under his police station area is transferred elsewhere,” said DIG Kumar.        The top cop has also ordered that a copy of such profiles be sent to the district crime record bureau. This includes even the profiles of criminals who have had a brush with the law over the past five years and are out on bail.        Based on the response and after monitoring the phased implementation of the scheme, the initiative could be replicated as a state model as well, said the DIG. “In most cases, the investigating officers (IOs) file a final report after initial investigation draws almost a blank. The IOs do not even have any record of suspected people who can possibly be behind any crime and who can be identified by the victim. We will strictly implement this to make sure that the effort does not go in vain,” the DIG said.        A prelude to this pilot protect is an ambitious central government scheme, Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS), which apparently failed to pick up. Launched in 2009, CCTNS aimed at creating a comprehensive and integrated system for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of policing through adopting of the principle of e-governance and creating a nationwide networking infrastructure for evolution of an IT-enabled-state-of-the-art tracking system.        " Under the CCTNS project, around 14,000 police stations across the country are proposed to be automated beside 6,000 higher offices in police hierarchy," Kumar added.
