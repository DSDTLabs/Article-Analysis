NEW DELHI: The adjudicating authority of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( ) confirmed the Enforcement Directorate’s provisional attachment order related to 11 plots worth around Rs 45 crore belonging to firms associated with family members of former Bihar CM   Prasad.

 
 The ED had provisionally attached the plots, including a 3-acre one in Danapur near Patna, in December last year in connection with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) hotel allotment case. The designated PMLA authority confirmed the attachment after it found the plots to be part of the proceeds of crime in the money laundering case.
 
 “Considering the material (filed) in the original complaint (by the ED)... I find that the immovable properties provisionally attached are involved in money laundering,” a recent order issued by member (law) of the adjudicating authority of PMLA, Tushar V Shah, said.
 
 The owners of the plots in question include Delight Marketing Co Pvt Ltd, now Lara Projects LLP, whose managing partner is Lalu’s wife   and partners are his sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap Yadav.
