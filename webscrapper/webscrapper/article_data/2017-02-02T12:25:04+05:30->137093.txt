LUDHIANA: For the families and friends of people injured in the   in Bathinda district’s Maur town on Tuesday evening, terror struck with official apathy.

 Schoolboy Anksuh (11) was playing outside his house with friends, welding shop owner Amrik Singh (26) was winding up for the day, and Jakrana Singh (26) was returning home from a temple when the two blasts ripped through Truck Union Road of Maur.
 
 Amrik’s father, Rajinder Singh said he saw his son on fire as soon as he rushed out of the house on hearing the sound of blast.
 
 “We put blankets around him to douse the fire. I immediately phoned the ambulance but rescue workers were busy treating VIPs” he said.
 
 Faced by a shortage of time and left with no other option, Rajinder hired a private ambulance and took Amrik to Bathinda Civil Hospital.
 
 He added, “From there, doctors referred us to go Guru Gobind Singh Medical Hospital, Faridkot. After some treatment, Amrik was referred to Dayananad Medical College & Hospital (DMCH), Ludhiana and we reached here at 4am.”
 
 Another injured, Jaskarn had gotten married two year back and become father last month.
 
 A resident Maur Kalan, had walked to a nearby temple along with uncles Nichatar Singh and Harnek Singh. On the way back to home, his uncles moved ahead, while Jaskaran stopped near the Congress elections meeting.
 
 His neighbor, Gurcharan Singh, who took him to hospital, said, “Jaskaran lost his parents in his childhood. His lives with his uncles.”
 Ankush’s father Gian Chand, who works in state education department, said it was horrifying to see his son’s face burnt. “I saw his screaming in pain. It was unbearable, but did we have option.“
 
 
 
 Ankush has suffered 60% burns, while Amrik and Jaskaran Singh got 30-35% burns, said doctors. All three are admitted in the burns unit of DMCH, Ludhiana.
