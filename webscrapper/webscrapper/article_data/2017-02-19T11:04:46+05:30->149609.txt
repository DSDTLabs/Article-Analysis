PATNA: Incarcerated RJD MP Md Shahabuddin’s ‘CM of circumstances’ remark for  , it seems, has not gone down well with the state government.   had made the remark while coming out of Bhagalpur central jail on September 10 last year after securing bail from Patna high court.

 Unlike May 19 last year when an SUV was used to shift Shahabuddin from Siwan jail to Bhagalpur central jail, a blue police van carried the criminal-turned-politician from Siwan to Beur jail on Saturday. From Beur jail, Shahabuddin was taken to   terminal to board New Delhi-bound Sampoorna Kanti Express. On June 19 last year, when Shahabuddin was sent to AIIMS-Delhi for treatment, he was allowed to board  . This time, however, he had to contend with a sleeper coach berth.
 
 The police also took away ignition keys of around nine SUVs in which the RJD supporters were following the security convoy of Shahabuddin soon after he emerged out of Siwan district jail around 2.45am. After securing bail, Shahabuddin had reached Siwan from Bahgalpur with a convoy of more than 300 SUVs on September 10 last year.
 
 Shahabuddin was whisked away from Siwan jail in the wee hours of Saturday much before his supporters could get a whiff of it. However, around 20 RJD men somehow gathered in front of the jail and started raising slogans in support of Shahabuddin before the police swung into action and evicted them.
 
 “The policemen seized keys of our vehicles all of a sudden,” said Lilawati Giri, a Shahabuddin loyalist. However, the police later returned the keys to owners of the vehicles.
 
 At Rajendra Nagar terminal too, the special task force personnel managed to keep Shahabuddin supporters at bay.
