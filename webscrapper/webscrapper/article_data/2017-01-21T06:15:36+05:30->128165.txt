JAIPUR:  , whose 2007 book   is considered among the most influential books since World War II, opined that large corporations such as Monsanto, which had a stranglehold on politics and media, had far greater potential for disruption than controversial US President Donald Trump.

 “It was not like Donald Trump had contested to be archbishop and his election win does not represent anything terribly disruptive,” he said while speaking at a session at   (JLF) on Friday.
 
 In agreement with Taleb, economist Ha-Joon Chang from South Korea pointed out that systems were in place in the US and arrangements for trade were regulated through treaties that the president could not disrupt. Asked if corporations must be forced to share their profits, Ha-Joon underlined the need for governments to ensure that they paid taxes. “That is very easy to do,” he said, stressing the need to do away with tax havens.
 
 At the JLF session titled ‘A World of Disruptions,’  , a teacher at   in the US, said “fragile masculinity” represented a potential area of disruption. In a sharp retort, Taleb pointed out that the potential of the young was being ruined by making education so prohibitively expensive and putting a huge burden of loans on young shoulders. “And then, Yale is teaching such nonsense as toxic masculinity,” he said.
