Hyderabad: City-based cyber security and threat intelligence startup,   on Thursday said it has developed a solution to protect data-at-rest against a variety of threats such as ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, data leakage, unauthorized retrieval of data from stolen hard disks, data modification and data destruction. The solution, Zero XT, which is being built with complex algorithms, is currently being evaluated by its critical clients in banks, financial institutions and government departments and will be launched in the market shortly, the company claimed.

 Pointing out that it began research on the product after the Sony Entertainment hack happened and much before the `Wannacry’ ransomware hit last week, the company said it invested significantly in R&D to help enterprises thwart such advanced attacks and some of its products have been validated and deployed by Indian defence, scientific and security organizations. Elaborating on ZeroXT, Chakradhar Kommera, co-founder and CEO, UNIK, said “The new product is an extension of its existing product Zero USB, which ensures a clean boot across a wide cross section of organizations/enterprises, thereby protecting the OS from any tampering/destruction attacks, and has an additional functionality of protecting data-at-rest.” 
 
 “While the spread of the present ‘WannaCry’ ransomware attack has slowed due to accidental remedy by a UK-based cyberanalyst, concern remains that such attacks could be launched in a much larger scale in the near future as the tools for embarking on ransomware attacks are readily available on the dark web,” added Mr. Kommera. According to UNIK, the ‘kill switch’ built into WannaCry accidentally helped halt the spread of the ransomware. However, ‘kill switches’ may not necessarily be built into future ransomware attacks, and their impact could be more devastating.
