HYDERABAD: A day after municipal administration minister   called   a 'Loafer Party', Congress leaders lashed out at the TRS leader for his comments and demanded that he be booked under Section 506 and 507 of the IPC. 

 Addressing separate press conferences, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief spokesperson Dasoju Sravan, MLAs A Revanth Reddy and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said many TRS leaders started their career in the Congress and asked whether they too were loafers.
 
 Sravan and Revanth alleged that the TRS has entered into a secret alliance with the BJP. When PM   was spitting venom against Telangana in Parliament, TRS MPs remained silent while Congress lodged a strong protest, they said. Their silence shows that the party has entered into an agreement with the   to protect itself from CBI probe, they added.
 
 Revanth said schemes such as Mission Bhagiratha are scams and that KTR would go to jail in future. He also enquired about the expenditure on KTR's foreign tours .
