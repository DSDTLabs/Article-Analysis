GURUGRAM: The legal tussle over the shifting of the   from MG Road to Sector 42, to make way for the Iffco Chowk  , doesn’t seem to come to an end any time soon. 

 Now, the Haryana Urban Development Authority ( ) has planned to file a review petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court challenging the district sessions court’s order (passed on May 4) that put a stay on the fuel station’s shifting claiming that the development authority did not follow the change in land use (CLU) rules before allocating the alternative site to Sukhjeet Mann — the owner of the petrol pump. 
 
 The land allotted for fuel station was earlier earmarked for a taxi stand in the master plan. The owner of a building — Ameya One, located near the said site — had filed a petition before district and sessions court on February 7, questioning Huda’s change of land plan. According to Huda officials, the shifting of the petrol pump was necessary for completing the underpass project.
 
 However, Huda officials, on Friday submitted a plea with additional advocate general Lokesh Sinhal stating that the sessions court stay — issued on May 4 — was affecting the pending work on the   underpass. “We have written to the chief administrator Huda seeking details on the project. We will file a petition in court on Monday,” Sinhal told TOI. 
 
 Chander Shekhar Khare, administrator, Huda Gurugram told TOI, “The authority is filing a review petition against the session court’s order and we are hopeful that we will get the desired judgment. We will also try for an early hearing as a major infrastructural work is on hold”.
