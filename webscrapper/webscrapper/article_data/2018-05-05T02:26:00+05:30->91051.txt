Patna: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) general secretary   Anwar on Friday suggested CM Nitish Kumar to bargain hard with the Centre with “vigorous renewed commitment” for grant of special category status to the state. “Follow the example of Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and sever ties with the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre if it is not agreeing to give special category status to the state,” Tariq, who shot off a letter to Nitish, said.

 Released the letter at the party’s state headquarters here, Tariq said, “Nitish should put his clout with the current dispensation to good use by fighting for Bihar's rights. If his pleas are ignored by the Centre, he must break his ties with the NDA like TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu did and carry forward his struggle for special status. If he fails to do so, his demand for special status will be seen as a mere political stunt,” TNN
