NEW DELHI: A delivery   of an e-commerce firm was attacked by a man and his sister in outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar last week. The man had gone to the woman’s house to deliver a mobile phone. The siblings robbed him of Rs 40,000 and also snatched the phone.

 A PCR call about the incident was made at 9pm on March 21, where the caller informed cops that a man was lying in a drain in Chander Vihar. Cops arrived and took him to a nearby hospital. The man had sustained serious injuries but is recuperating now.
 
 Keshav told police that he was assigned to deliver a mobile phone worth Rs 11,000 to the woman’s house but couldn’t find her flat as he was new to the area. Meanwhile, the woman was calling the victim, asking him about her consignment.
 
 Cops said that the woman started shouting at Keshav when he reached at her flat and the two got into an argument. She then allegedly brought a kitchen knife and attacked Keshav with her brother.
