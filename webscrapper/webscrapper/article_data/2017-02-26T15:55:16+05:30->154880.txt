CHENNAI:   working president and leader of the opposition in the   assembly M K   doesn’t want party members to gift him shawls on his   that falls on March 1. He wants them to avoid extravagant banners and posters to celebrate his birthday, which might lead to “disenchantment among the public.”

 Instead, Stalin wants the DMK members to gift him books on his birthday and organise welfare programmes. 
 
 “Out of love, many party members gift me glittering shawls on my birthday. With changing time and sartorial preferences, shawls have become useless pieces of cloth and gifting them has become meaningless. Instead, revive the habit of gifting books that would help one lifelong,’’ he said in a statement on Sunday. 
 
  “I have been insisting on organising blood donation camps, welfare programmes and tree planting,’’ he added.
