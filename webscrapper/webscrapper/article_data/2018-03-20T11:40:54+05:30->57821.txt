BHUBANESWAR:   ( ) in Puri on Monday said a group of 60 servitors of the shrine would visit several temples in north India to understand the rituals, etiquette, facilities for devotees and management systems there. 

 The servitors would start their journey from Puri railway station on Wednesday and return on April 4 under Anubhav Yatra (exposure trip). 
 
 A temple source said the servitors would visit temples in Allahabad, Varanasi, Ayodhya and  , among other places. 
 
 "The group of 60 sevayats will travel to different temples and provide us their feedback. We have requested the travellers to specifically see the cleanliness and facilities for devotees in other shrines. We will see if some of their recommendations can be replicated in Puri temple," said a temple official. The temple body said the learning trip will benefit the priests, many of whom have not visited outside the state. 
 
 Worried over the alleged uncouth attitude of some priests, the temple body had started the Anibhav Yatra in 2006 with a view to instil civic sense and etiquette in them. The SJTA said almost all the servitors will get a chance to travel to other temples. 
 
 A temple official said the previous Anubhav Yatras played a positive role in reforming the attitude of servitors.
