RAIPUR: All   in the state capital will be digitised and linked with   so that payments from beneficiaries can be collected online. 

 In Chhattisgarh, there are around 12,000 fair price shops (FPS) and as 95 per cent of the state's population has  , the beneficiaries procuring ration from there could make online payment through their Aadhar card. 
 
 Talking to TOI, food civil supplies and consumer protection department's deputy secretary Shiv Anant Tayal said, "To encourage   in the state the fair price shops would be 'Aadhar' enabled. Initially, the project has been started on pilot basis in five districts including Raigarh, Rajnandgaon, Dhamtari, Mahasamund and Balod along with Raipur district. This would make the payment and ration procurement process easy and efficient for the government and empower the beneficiaries." 
 
 For this a software application called Aadhar payment enabled system is being installed in FPS along with the bio-metric devices in which the thumb-impression of beneficiaries would be scanned. 
 
 This will further verify bank and personal details of the beneficiary linked to Aadhar card. Ration would be allotted on cross-checking the identification. As per the National Informatics Centre's officials, the beneficiary availing ration at FPS have to make one Aadhar enabled payment out of the five transactions made at the shop. This will revise the verification of the real identification of the ration card holder and the beneficiary can avail the ration from any shop and skip the long queues. Aadhar enabled payment at fair price shops would empower beneficiaries.
 
  The project aims to revamp the public distribution system, remove corruption and make life-hassle free for poor while drawing grain, sugar and kerosene from FPS.
