Surat: Convicted sexual predator Asaram’s son Narayan  , who is facing rape and sexual assault charges, was produced in a local court on Thursday. The hearing in the case scheduled for Wednesday had been postponed for a day. 

 “The court was to examine a witness, but the witness could not remain present in the court due to which the hearing has been rescheduled to May 10. May be a fresh date will be announced soon,” special public prosecutor P N Parmar said. 
 
  counsel submitted an application to admit a few documents of   report as evidence. The commission had conducted an inquiry into the death of two cousins studying in Asaram’s ashram in Ahmedabad and submitted its report in 2013.
 
 There was tight security when Sai was brought to the court on Thursday. The police vehicle was taken close to the court building stairs and a similar procedure adopted when Sai was taken back to Lajpore Central Jail ( ). A crime branch team was also present to ensure tight bandobast. In the past, Sai used to talk to media. 
 
 City police had registered two sisters’ complaints — one against Asaram and the other against Sai — of rape, sexual assault, illegal confinement and other charges in October 6, 2013. The two separate complaints were registered at Jahangirpura police station. The complaint against Asaram was transferred to Ahmedabad for further investigation since the crime had taken place in Ahmedabad.
 
 The younger of the two sisters had filed complaint against Sai, accusing him of repeated sexual assaults between 2002 and 2005 when she was living at Surat ashram. The elder sister in her complaint against Asaram accused him of repeated sexual assaults between 1997 and 2006 when she was living at his ashram on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.
