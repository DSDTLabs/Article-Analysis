AHMEDABAD:   high court on Monday stayed the Bhavnagar Municipal Corporation ( ) from going ahead with the survey of street vendors, on the grounds that it has outsourced the activity to a private company. 

 The HC intervened in the issue in response to a petition filed by Self Employed Workers' Organization, which has taken exception to outsourcing of the activity by BMC. 
 
 The court issued notices to the state government, BMC, Gujarat Urban Livelihood Mission and the private firm,  , which was tasked by the civic body to conduct survey of street vendors.
 
 According to petitioner's advocate, Sangeeta Pahwa, BMC hired a private firm to undertake the survey of street hawkers and vendors in the municipal limits. According to the norms of Street Vendors Act, the survey is to be undertaken by civic body's town vending committee, which has to have a sizeable representation of vendors in it. Since, the survey undertaken was against the provisions of law, the activity was challenged.
 
 Earlier too, BMC had initiated a survey by the committee, but it was not in accordance with the scheme mentioned in the law. Since it was not in the interest of street vendors, the issue reached the high court. BMC assured the HC that it would start a fresh survey.
 
 Further hearing in this matter is on June 12.
