RAIPUR: Less than a week after security forces gunned down 39   in  , elite Greyhound commandos crossed the Chhattisgarh border and shot dead eight rebels in a forest region of Bijapur on Friday.

 
 Six of those killed are women. The dead haven't been identified yet but going by the fact that six rocket launchers were seized, security forces believe there may have hit a key squad of the rebels.
 
 Special director general of Police Durgesh Madhav Awasthi told reporters here that Chhattisgarh police and CRPF assisted the Greyhounds in the gunbattle. The security forces did not suffer any causalities.
 
 The gunfight broke out on a remote hillock near Ilmidi police station of Bijapur district, bang on the border with Telangana. Greyhounds were pursuing a squad of rebels on a tip off and contacted the Chhattisgarh forces on realising that the Maoists had crossed over.
 
 With police and CRPF blocking escape routes, the Greyhounds went after the Maoists. "When security forces were cordoning off the forest hillock, the rebels opened indiscriminate fire, leading to a gun battle", said Awasthi. Commandos moved forward to comb the area and came across eight bodies, said the DGP. "All of them were in uniform," Awasthi said, adding that an SLR rifle, a .303, four .12 bore guns, a .315 rifle, a single-barrel muzzle-loading gun, three hand grenades, six rocket launchers and Maoist literature were seized from the area.
 
 Bodies of the slain   were airlifted to Bijapur town by an IAF chopper and the process of identifying them is underway, he said.
