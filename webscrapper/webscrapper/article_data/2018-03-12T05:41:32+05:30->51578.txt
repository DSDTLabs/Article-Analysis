NEW DELHI: The   (LJP), an ally of the Modi government, on Sunday said there was no fragmentation in the  , days after the TDP pulled out its two ministers from the cabinet and Shiv Sena’s announcement to fight the 2019 elections on its own.

 Backing the PM, LJP chief   said when NDA came to power, BJP had full majority. “But the PM reached out to other regional parties for alliance. The alliance is united and I appeal to TDP to remain in the NDA,” he said.
 
 Paswan said though Andhra Pradesh had not been given special category status, the government offered a special package, adding that if the southern state got special category status, then Bihar too would demand it.
 
 Paswan’s son and LJP parliamentary party chief Chirag told party workers to take up the issue of atrocities against Dalits and the poor irrespective of whether an ally was in power. “We are not against any party or government on such issues. We are against anti-social elements involved in such acts. We will raise the issue and demand justice,” the junior   said.
