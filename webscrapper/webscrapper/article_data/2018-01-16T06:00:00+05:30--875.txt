We had told you that   will be seen in a totally different look in  , which sees him teaming up with his Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom (NKPK) director  . Here, we present to you the look of the Makkal Selvan. 

 The look has been designed by Oscar-winning makeup artiste   and Alex Noble. Says Balaji Tharaneetharan, “Last month, Vijay   and I had flown to Los Angeles to meet the makeup artistes to get the mould and wig designed for this prosthetic makeup. We have started shooting Vijay Sethupathi’s portions only now. It takes almost four hours for him to don this makeup and one hour to get it removed. It is a tedious process, but the outcome has been excellent.” 
 
 The film, he says, will be a drama, and revolves around Vijay Sethupathi’s character, and adds that National Award-winning actress Archana is paired opposite him. “His character is not named Seethakaathi, but you will understand the significance of the title when you watch the film,” says the director.
 
 Remya Nambeesan, Gayathrie and Parvathy Nair will be seen in cameos in this film, which also has veteran director Mahendra, Mouli, and NKPK’s Bagavathy Perumal and   in supporting roles.
