AHMEDABAD: Housing for  , planned in posh areas, is becoming a contentious issue for realtors. Such is the pressure that last-minute changes to TP schemes have turned into a political battle in the   (AMC). 

 On Tuesday, the opposition   alleged that some 616 housing units were planned to come up near the water tank near Silver Crust Society on Sola-Science City Road. When the revised plans put before the standing committee on Tuesday, the plot was shifted to one in TP scheme-31, at Gota, near  . The Congress has now sought an inquiry into the two earlier phases of EWS housing.
 
 “These economically weaker sections are largely employed in posh areas especially in offices. Had their EWS homes been here, it would have cut their travel costs. These families could even get their children admitted to a good school under the RTE Act. The   talks of the poor and that they are going all out for inclusive development. But clandestinely, this is how they thwart the poor,” says opposition leader in the AMC, Dinesh Sharma. 
 
 A total of 10,143 houses were constructed in the first phase and 4,293 EWS houses were constructed at eight locations in the second phase. “We will demand an inquiry into these EWS packages, to know where their original locations were. This is a clear case of exclusion in the name of inclusive development,” says Sharma.
