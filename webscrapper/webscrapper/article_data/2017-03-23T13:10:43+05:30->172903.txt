CHENNAI: Want to buy a vehicle? Better get ready to flash your mobile number,   and  . A new state government ruling has made this mandatory for registration of all vehicles, including two-wheelers.

 Dealers are already seeking this information from customers and two-wheeler manufacturers expect a 40%50% drop in demand in rural areas over the next couple of months. Since car and SUV sales are not that dependent on ruralsemi urban markets and the ticket size is much bigger, the real impact will be on two-wheeler sales, say industry officials.
 
 The ruling, sources say , is an extension of a ruling currently prevalent in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. No other state has a similar rule.While Aadhaar card is common enough, PAN cards are not, especially in rural and semi-urban markets, say auto industry experts.
 
 The notification from the principal secretarytransport commissioner says the issue of registration certificates under the new Vahan software will enable the inclusion of mobile number, Aadhaar number and PAN.
 
 “The data is not being collected and entered in the registration certificate now,“ it said. Two-wheeler marketers are worried. “There will be a very big impact on sales of two-wheelers and even fourwheelers,“ Yamaha India sales and marketing vicepresident, Roy Kurien said.“In Tamil Nadu, our vehicles mostly sell in urban areas but 40% of our volume comes from rural areas and in these markets we expect a 40%-50% drop as the initial impact.“
 
 Tamil Nadu is the country's second largest twowheeler market at 12,16,420 units in the first nine months of this fiscal compared to 18,26,031 units in UP and Uttarakhand. In growth terms it is the highest at 25%.
 
 “It is still early days as the new rules have just come in,“   CEO   said. “We understand the reason for making Aadhaar compulsory but we must study the reason for seeking PAN details. We are waiting to see the extent of impact on sales.“
