A white shirt goes with any jeans or skirt but that's not the case for your brassiere. The right colour matters here, nude may not be your perfect choice and even white. Nude has the ability to create a faux pas if the colour goes wrong while a white bra's outline can pop under the white tee. 

 
 
 
 
 According to a new research, a red coloured bra won't show under the white shirt. Yes, we have science to back that up. This surprising colour is actually invisible under the white shirt. Fact: Skin has red undertones and that's why red blends well with a white coloured shirt. 
 
  
  
 
 
 If you have a fair skin tone, you should look for a true-blue red. Darker skin tones can pick between scarlet and burgundy shades while people with olive complexions can go for cranberry hues.
 
  
  
 
 
 Red brassiere may seem like an absurd choice for white shirts. But this styling trick is worth trying and crimson shades can be your everyday staple and not just for Valentine's Day.
 
  
  
 
 Don't believe us? Try this trick yourself. Test all the scarlet hues in your lingerie drawer and see if they pass the white shirt test. Make sure the red tones are true colours and don't have purple and pink tones.
