BENGALURU: Ahead of the   polls in Karnataka scheduled on March 23, JD(S) state president H D   on Monday made an offer to the  : Help us win one seat to the Upper House in the Parliament and you can expect support later.

 Kumaraswamy told TOI he has sent word to the Congress high command, asking it’s help to get partyman B M Farook elected to the Rajya Sabha.
 
 In return, Kumaraswamy said: “The Congress party can have a working relationship with the JD(S) and a post-poll alliance after the 2018 elections in case of a hung assembly.”
 
 He said, “The ball is in the Congress court on whether they want an additional seat in the Rajya Sabha or keep the window open for a JD(S) alliance in the event of a hung assembly.’’The JD(S) unsuccessfully fielded Farook in 2016, when he was defeated after eight JD(S) MLAs cross-voted to elect MP K C Ramamurthy of the Congress.
 
 The JD(S) has only 37 votes with two MLAs Shivaraj Patil and Manappa Vajjal resigning and HD Kote’s MLA Chikkamadu passing away. 
 
 However, of the 37, seven, including BZA Zameer Ahmad Khan and N Cheluvarayaswamy, have publicly shifted their allegiance to the Congress and are scheduled to join the ruling party later next month at a public rally in Bengaluru.
 
 In this situation, and unable to get Farook elected on their strength, the JD(S) has made this offer to the Congress.
