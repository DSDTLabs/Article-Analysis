CHENNAI: With more than 20 lakh   expected to   to mark the 1000th   of   next month, the   has directed the Tamil Nadu government to make necessary arrangements keeping the huge number of visitors in mind. Ramanuja was born in 1017 and his birth anniversary is to be celebrated for 10 days from April 22 to May 1, 2017.

 A direction to this effect was issued by the first bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice M Sundar on Thursday when a PIL filed by International Sri Vaishnava Ramanuja Samrajaya Sabha came up for hearing.
 
 Its secretary Swami Govinda Ramanuja Dasa, who argued the case in person, told the bench that the saint was a great social reformer who fought for the rights, and status of women and the downtrodden. Ramanuja Dasa said that though there is just over a month for the festival to commence, the district authorities had not made adequate arrangements, and that approach roads around the temple were in bad shape. He said the temple tank, Rama Thirtham, where devotees take a holy dip, is overrun by the thorny seema karuvelam trees.
 
 Though various service organisations are making arrangements for distribu tion of free food, there are no allocated spaces for them and for people who wish to stay in the town, located 45 km from Chennai, during the festival, he said. There are no designated parking areas identified for the festival, and adequate number of fire safety measures and equipment had not been kept ready though the festival is coming in the peak of summer, he said.
 
 Responding to the complaints, special government pleader Maharaja told the bench that authorities had already conducted a couple of meetings where representatives from fire, police and revenue, besides Hindu religious and charitable endowments, departments participated.
 
 Recording the statement, the bench then directed “respondent-authorities to look into the matter to make proper arrangements for the smooth conduct of the function, and also provide safety measures, taking into consideration the large number of devotees participating in it.“
