Chandigarh: Congress MLA from Palwal Karan Singh Dalal on Tuesday accused the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government of releasing over 2,500 acres in Bawal after completion of acquisition process. He called is a major land scam and sought the government’s response.

 Dalal, who was interacting with media here about the former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s ‘Jan Kranti Yatra’ scheduled to start from Hodal on February 25, alleged that CBI and Haryana vigilance bureau were acting on the directions of state and the Union governments.
 
 He countered the charges that Hooda is facing in Manesar land scam case in which CBI has already filed a chargesheet naming the senior Congress leader.
 
 “Hooda has done that in the larger interest of public and that, too, on the requests made by then deputy commissioner and farmers. Hence it was no crime. We have full faith in the law of the land. We will fight the case,” said Dalal.
 
 “But, will this government, which boasts of the zero corruption, reply on the Bawal land scam? The land chunk has gone to the influential and the rich,” he alleged.
 
 Dalal attacked INLD and BJP both while referring to the preparations for the February 25 programme to be chaired by Hooda. He claimed that the inaugural rally of the yatra would be many times bigger than that of the BJP rally in Jind and the programmes organized by INLD in Haryana.
 
 “Just for the sake of Amit Shah’s rally, which ultimately turned out to be a record failure for BJP, the Haryana government had spent crores of rupees. There were 150 companies of paramilitary forces deployed to protect just one person, hence you can imagine the state of affairs. Hodal event will be the constituency-level or the district-level meeting but you will see the size of gathering. Hodal will be the first mirror for INLD and BJP. Congress will organize such meetings and yatras throughout this year,” he said.
