MUMBAI: The  , which had received a complaint in May about a huge electric junction box installed in the common passage of the 20th floor of a Versova tower by actor  , has given her a clean chit. 

 After the complaint from another resident of  , the local ward office had termed it as "objectionable". Now, the same office, in a letter sent to the complainant, has said the "common passage (in question) is owned by Sharma".
 
 Sunil Batra, who lives on the 16th floor, had complained to municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta in May against the junction box handling the wiring of the entire floor as well as of the central AC. The two wooden cabinets - 10 ft high, 4 ft wide and 15 inches deep - are covered with wallpaper and kept locked. "This is in violation of fire brigade rules and high court has also passed the judgment of common areas to be free of any encumbrances," said the complainant's letter.
 
 Following the complaint, the BMC inspected the site and in a written communication to the actor said it is "highly objectionable". Now, two months later, the assistant engineer (building & factory department) of K west ward has written to Batra, saying "Electrical junction boxes are fixed on the wall. It is fixed just like in their own home. Total common passage is owned by Shri Sharma (Anushka's father)...".Batra said this is a case of preferential treatment given to a well-known personality. "The law should be uniform for all and if they are allowed to own the common passage, everyone should be allowed to do so across the city," he added.
