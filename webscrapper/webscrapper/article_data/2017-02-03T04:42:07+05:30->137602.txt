NEW DELHI: An electrician from Nagpur bought an acre of land in Maoist-infested Bastar and set up a gutka and pan masala factory. On Wednesday, a team of the   Intelligence raided the factory, situated in the forests of Baleinga village, and detected duty evasion of over Rs 64 crore. 

 Though the agency is yet to trace the real owners of the gutka factory, it is suspected that part of the illegal proceeds might have gone into the coffers of Maoists and to some officials of the district administration. DGCEI officials have seized at least 10 machines used by the accused to run their operations. Officials are also tracking a leading Jaipur-based businessman who is suspected to be the actual beneficiary of the illegal factory. 
 
 The DGCEI is also in the process of writing to other central agencies on suspected Maoist funding. This is probably the first time that a team of investigators has been sent from Delhi to the dense forests of Bastar. The DGCEI team, dispatched from its headquarters in Delhi, has alerted authorities about possible nexus of those running the factory with Left wing ultras. 
 
 A senior DGCEI official said that the land use change from agricultural to residential on the plot in question indicated that deviations were allowed by the district administration allegedly on extraneous reasons. Preliminary questioning of the occupants of the factory revealed that payoffs were regularly made to government officials as well as Maoists. 
 
 After change of land use, the Chhattisgarh state electricity department allowed installation of a 25 kw connection, which is unusual, raising suspicion of connivance of government officials with the factory owners who had not declared that they were manufacturing gutka in the premises. 
 
 The government has banned gutka manufacturing and those who claim to be manufacturing pan masala have to make a declaration before central excise authorities.
