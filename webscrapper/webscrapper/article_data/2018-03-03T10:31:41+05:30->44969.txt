Mysuru: Devotees visiting   temple atop   will no longer return hungry as the temple authorities have started free distribution of food three times a day. 

 
 
  
 
 Earlier, prasadam was given to devotees between 1.30 pm to 2.30 pm only during the annual car festival. Now the authorities have started food distribution since Thursday.
 
 While breakfast will be offered from 7.30am to 10.30am, snacks will be given from 7.30pm until 9pm. 
 
 Earlier this week, DC D Randeep had hinted about extending dasoha, and on Friday he ordered officials to implement the new menu of food. On Friday, the DC said breakfast is being served at the templeâ€™s   bhavan since Thursday.
