MADURAI: The Indian Space Research Organisation ( ) has urged industrialists to form a consortium to supply components that will be beneficial for use in rockets and satellites. 

 Addressing reporters on the sidelines of a public session organised by the   ( ) here on Tuesday, director of Isro propulsion complex and distinguished scientist, S   said that every rocket and satellite contains lakhs of components, for which Isro depends on industries.
 
 There are major players like HAL, Mahindra, Larsen & Toubro collaborating with Isro, however there is enormous scope for small scale industries to contribute the components, which are not made by big players, Pandian said and listed out some components like fastners, gaskets, valves, insulations and bearings. “We are encouraging the industries here to form a consortium to supply components,” he said.
 
 Dealing with a consortium will be easier for an organisation like Isro, where it can hand over a particular stage of work to the consortium, which in turn can share the components making within themselves, he said. Further, Isro also supports industries and conducts lot of outreach programmes like industrial meetings, vendor development programmes to rope in industrialists for the task, he said. 
 
 Elaborating on a recent model of consortium at Bengaluru, Pandian said that six industrial units successfully manufactured a satellite after Isro provided them design and guidance. The organisation now needs such consortiums to manufacture rockets. There is a project of giving away entire PSLV making to private players in future, he said.
 
 Isro has a target of sending 12 satellites and launch vehicles in 2019 and another 13 launch vehicles and satellites in 2020. Other major projects like Chandrayan, GSLV are also in the pipeline, so there is lot of work in the organisation and scope for industries in the locality, Pandian said.
