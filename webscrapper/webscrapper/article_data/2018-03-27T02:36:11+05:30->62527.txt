NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority ( ) on Monday reviewed the status of the   of   and asked agencies to increase production at the Bawana gas plant from 250MW to 500MW by April 15. 

 In a meeting with government officials and power agencies on Monday, EPCA was informed that the process to shut down the Badarpur unit is ahead of schedule and is likely to meet the July 31 deadline. Officials also said the Tughlakabad 400/220kV substation had a May deadline to start operations.
 
 EPCA said it was important to utilise the Bawana plant to avoid wastage of public resources. “Nearly Rs 1,100 crore in fixed costs are already being spent on Bawana. It will be extremely efficient in terms of NOx emission and will send the correct message in terms of shifting to gas-based power generation,” EPCA member Sunita Narain said in the meeting.
 
 Narain further asked the authorities to ensure that the Bawana plant generates 500MW from April 15, if not April 1. “We can at least run one full unit and increase the production gradually. If this becomes a successful model, we can look at running other gas plants,” said Narain.
 
 On February 28, EPCA allowed resumption of operations at the Badarpur plant, but set a deadline of July 31 for its closure. Power department officials, however, said its closure won’t affect Delhi’s power supply.
