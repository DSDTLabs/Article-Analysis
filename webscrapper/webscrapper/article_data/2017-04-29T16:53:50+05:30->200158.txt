 TV is currently trying its best to get back in the TRP game. After the failing TRPs of  , the channel has been desperately trying to get back on track.
 
  Apparently the channel is planning to bring back its hit reality game show  .
  
  Times of India was the first one to report that   is coming back with Dus Ka Dum.
  
  Hosted By Salman Khan, the first season of Dus Ka Dum did exceptionally well and was very high rated. Some of the episodes from this show are still talked about because of the hilarious content that came out in game. And Now Sony TV is trying to get the show back on and may even replace The   Show.
  
  
 
  
  The question arises here is whether Salman Khan, who has been associated with   TV for the longest time now work with Sony? There were rumours about Salman not continuing with   anymore after season 10. Also during the show, Salman said that if   comes on the channel again, He will not work with Colors again.
  
  The reason why we brought up Priyanka Jagga's issue is because in conversation with a media portal, Priyanka said that she has an exclusive contract with Colors and can't take up any shows due to that. Does this mean that Salman has already ended business with Colors?
  
  We are yet to recieve details from the channels as they refuse to disclose any information as of now.
