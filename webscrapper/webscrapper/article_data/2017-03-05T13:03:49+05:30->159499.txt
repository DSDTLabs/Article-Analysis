PANAJI: Despite recent shocks to the economy, India’s growth story remains strong, said managing director,  , R Mukhundan on Saturday. Speaking on the sidelines of a Confederations of Indian Industry Director’s Guild workshop,   stated that there was a need to increase the pool of director-level leadership to sustain companies as the economy grew.

 Gross domestic product (GDP) data, for the December quarter, pegged growth at 7%, surprising analysts. Several economists and brokers have raised questions over the data given out by the government and said that the number could be revised lower.
 
 “The long-term India story is very intact. There will be external shocks from time to time and from sector to sector,” Mukhundan said while adding that India would be the fastest growing economy for the next 10-15 years.
 
 “Does it look like the economy is growing or not? Is the industry producing more than last year or not? If you go by all those metrics, then we are certainly going in the right direction. The long-term and medium-term story is intact, unless we do a lot of things wrong to stop the momentum from happening,” he said while announcing the details of the three-day workshop.
 
 The director’s guild gold certification programme is aimed at enhancing board effectiveness for senior management. “We will have a lot more companies and a lot more need for directors in the coming five-eight years. As it is companies are finding it difficult to identify directors so we said we must get the younger lot and expose them to the board processes, to inculcate in them what it takes to be a good board member,” Mukhundan said.
 
 “We are trying to differentiate between compliance and governance. Compliance is meeting mandatory requirements but governance goes behind that. We are trying to bring in good governance practices and data shows that companies that follow this, actually outperform others,” Director’s Guild programme coordinator   said.
