AHMEDABAD: Gujarat University plans to earmark one specific hour where all varsity officials will sit together to find solutions to pending issues of students.

 GU vice-chancellor   said that there have been complaints about several issues, including unnecessary delays in getting duplicate marksheets or degree certificates issues.
 
 He said that students were made to run from one table to another to get their work sanctioned. “We are now thinking that a specific hour will be dedicated to students where the registrar, the controller of examinations and four other officials will sit in one room and a decision on students’ issues will be taken immediately.” Officials said that, for example, to get a duplicate  , the student was made to get approval from various departments. With the new arrangement, the controller of examinations and registrar will immediately hear the matter and approve or reject the application. tnn
