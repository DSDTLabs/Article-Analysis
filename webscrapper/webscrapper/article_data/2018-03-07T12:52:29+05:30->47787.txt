SALEM: After a gap of six years, film shooting resumed in   and surrounding areas a few weeks ago. A non-familiar cinema production company began shooting in ‘Chinna Kodambakkam’.

 “The name of the cinema has been titled Veettukkum Naattukkum,” said a person associated with the direction unit. Talking to TOI, he said the shooting took place at Gunderipallam, Vellode bird sanctuary, Bhavanisagar dam, Hasanur and   dam areas. 
 
 He said the producer cum director has already worked in many cinema companies and had visited many places in Gobichettipalayam and its surrounded villages during shooting times. “So he preferred to take the shooting here,” he added.
 
 Residents of Gobichettipalayam are now hoping that their business would be revived once film shootings continue in the town.
