GUWAHATI: The enrolment of many impoverished students in its list of board examinees whose examination fees were waived has left the  , Assam, ( ), struggling to manage its finances. 

 Following a state government directive, Seba had waived the examination fees of about 2.8 lakh board examinees with a family income of less than a lakh per year. Even though the decision was praised, Seba now has to depend on the state government to bail it out of a financial mess. Examination fees are the main source of its funds.
 
 "Apart from the exam fees, Seba does not have any source of income. Around 71% of this year's Class X board examinees have found a place on a fee-waiver list. As a result, the board has lost around Rs 14 crore. The state government needs to pay this amount to the board at the earliest so that we can ensure smooth conduct of the exams," a source in Seba said on Friday.
 
 Soon after the conclusion of the class 10 exam on March 10, Seba will need urgent financial support as the evaluation process will begin across the state. "We need to pay the officials engaged during the evaluation process. Moreover, the board has to make all the expenditure of the year with the funds raised from collected fees. So, the government needs to reimburse the fees, that has been waived off," the source added.
 
 Till now, Seba has earned only around Rs 6 crore through examination fees. The process of filling up the exam forms has been completed. Out of 3,91,539 registered candidates for the High School   (HSLC) and Assam High Madrassa (AHM) examinations, the board has waived the fees of 2,79,284 board examinees.
 
 There is comparatively less pressure on the   (AHSEC), which conducts the Class XII state board examination. Around one lakh Class XII board examinees are likely to be included on the fee-waiver list.
 
 Chairman of the AHSEC, NM Hussain, said, out of around 2.5 lakh candidates, the exam fees of around a lakh candidates might be waived.
