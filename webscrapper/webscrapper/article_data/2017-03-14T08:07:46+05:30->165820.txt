BENGALURU: If you have the habit of leaving your car or bike at Metro stations overnight, refrain from doing so. The   (BMRC) has issued a circular stating that parking on its premises is allowed only between opening and closing hours of rail operations (6am to 10pm). 

 It has further said that parking isn’t allowed during night hours, something which many passengers have been doing. In a circular issued recently, UA Vasanth Rao, general manager finance (taxation and resources), BMRC said: “It has come to our notice that parking contractors are using the areas for night parking. This is against the tender conditions. As per the conditions, the parking lots shall be operational from opening to closing hours of Metro service. Violating the terms may result in termination of licence agreement.”
 
 “Night parking has been prohibited as a safety measure. Any vehicle left behind will be reported to the jurisdictional police station for necessary action,” it further stated.
 
 A security guard at the   station said they have been told to ensure that no vehicles are parked after closing hours. A parking lot staffer, on condition of anonymity, said: “We used to collect Rs 30 for two-wheelers and Rs 60 for four-wheelers for night parking. Now it has been withheld. However, some passengers say the facility shouldn’t have been withdrawn.”
 
 Suraj Kashyap, a resident of Kengeri in southwest Bengaluru, who parks his bike regularly at the Mysuru Road Metro station, is upset with the move. “I work at Whitefield. Sometimes I spend the night at a friend’s place there and get my bike from the station the next evening. Metro authorities should think of everybody before initiating such steps. Those misusing the facility should be dealt with separately,” he added.
