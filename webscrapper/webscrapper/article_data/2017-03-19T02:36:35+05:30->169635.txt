 Ritu’s cousin Saurabh Chauhan said that she was alone in the kitchen when she was attacked. “Ritu’s mother Omvati works in a farm field and had left the house early on Saturday.

 “We have lodged a case under section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC and are questioning Raju’s father about his whereabouts and we hope he will soon be nabbed,” said Singh.
