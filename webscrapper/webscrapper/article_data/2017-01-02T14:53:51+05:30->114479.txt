KOCHI:  's Ramanan could never marry his beloved Chandrika. But, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of his tragic love poem, a Ramanan and Chandrika, who are man and wife in real life, came to   at Edappally on Sunday, much to the delight of those assembled.
 
 The couple live in Palakkad and have been married for almost three decades. “We have two children Gopika and Gopakumar.Ours was an arranged marriage but people always mistook it for a love story. I am a painter by profession and my wife looks after farming and poultry activities in our house," said Ramanan.
 
 Aptly titled 'Ramaniyam', the unique event was held at the Changampuzha Samadhi with 25 'Ramanans' and one 'Chandrika' participating in the event.
 
 S Ramanan said: “I was on a quest to find how many people shared this unique name and I met Dr Ramanan Earat, a psychiatrist from Palakkad and we teamed together and found 15 Ramanans in the district. Last year on  , we had a get together for all those with this name. The success of that event was an encouragement and we chalked out Ramaniyam," he said.
 
 The great poet's daughter, Dr Lalitha, grandson Dr Harikumar and critic and biographer of the poet   were special guests at the event. “I hope such events continue and be an inspirations for others too", said Dr Lalitha said. K P Ramanan inaugurated the event. “My father was an ardent lover of literature and he loved the works of Changampuzha and so that may be the reason why he named me Ramanan," he said in his inaugural speech.
 
 “Changampuzha's works are still alive in Malayalam literature. Even if the poet is dead, his works are forever. The name Ramanan means to love and make others happy. I hope that today's generation will not feel shy in giving such a name to their kids," Dr Ramanan Earat said.
