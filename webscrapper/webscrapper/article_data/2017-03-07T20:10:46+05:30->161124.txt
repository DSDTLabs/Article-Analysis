NAGPUR: A minor ground fire   bamboo plantations and grass at   on Monday evening.

 The fire destroyed half hectare (5,000 sq metre) forest opposite social forestry nursery. Officials suspect the fire must have started after a passer-by threw a cigarette butt.
 
 “The fire was brought under control around 8.20pm with the help of NMC fire tenders and forest staff,” said forest officials.
 
 With the onset of summer, fire incidents have been common in forest areas. Though three forest watchers have been appointed, they could not stop the fire from spreading. Sources said one of the main reasons for fire was non-completion of fireline works.
