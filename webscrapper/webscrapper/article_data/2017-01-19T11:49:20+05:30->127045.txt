CHANDIGARH: Almost two months after family of a   ( ) trooper, who died in an air crash in Delhi on December 22, 2015, had moved to Punjab and Haryana high court accusing Haryana government of non-payment of financial assistance, the state government on Wednesday told the court about the released fund.

 Sub-inspector Chote Lal Sharma, a resident of Koriawas village in   district, was killed after a BSF plane crashed near Dwarka and burst into flames just outside the   airport shortly after take-off. All 10 people onboard had died in the accident.
 
 The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the deceased’s son, Somesh Vashisth seeking directions for release of financial assistance of Rs 20 lakh announced by the Haryana government. Further, directions to frame policy to provide martyr’s status to paramilitary persons who lost their life in performance of official duty has also been sought.
 
 Responding to the petition, Nitin Kumar Yadav, secretary to Haryana government’s home department, filed a written statement before the HC stating that the state has handed over Rs 20 lakh to Chote Lal’s family on December 15, 2016. He further stated that the decision regarding martyr status to paramilitary persons was not within the domain of state government, as only Union government could decided on such issues.
 
 Earlier on May 6, 2016, the deputy commissioner (DC) Mahendergarh had rejected the petitioner’s claim of Rs 20 lakh compensation amount citing January 31, 2014 policy that the personnel who died in air crash in general journey are not entitled to the benefits of ex gratia grant.
 
 Seeking directions to set aside the DC’s order and provide him compensation amount, the petitioner has argued that the journey of personnel who died in air crash cannot be considered general journey because he was on bona fide official duty and boarded the plane to provide technical assistance.
