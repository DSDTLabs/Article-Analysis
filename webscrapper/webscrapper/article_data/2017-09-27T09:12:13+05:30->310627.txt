WUHAN: It was a combination of  's struggle on the day and the effervescent quality of the 20-year-old  's play that sent the second-seeded Romanian crashing out of the Dongfeng Motor   on Tuesday .

 The 25-year-old's inability to hit the stride after a three-week break from competition was highlighted by the Russian's free flowing game, taking Kasatkina to 6-2, 6-1 win in the second round clash. The damning piece of statistic for Halep, who missed two fair chances this year to climb to the No.1 spot in the   rankings, came on the second serve. She won just 11 per cent of those points. As bruising as the sun overhead.
 
 Halep, playing her first match since her loss to Russian Maria Sharapova in the first round of the US Open, was up against an opponent who has logged two wins over the former No.1 Angelique Kerber this year.
 
 The Russian, whose game carries the delicious mix of an assorted box of chocolates, blamed her richness of range on the men's game, which she watched growing up in Togliatti, Russia.
 
 In other second round matches, Greek qualifier Maria Sakkari knocked out fourth-seeded Dane Caroline Wozniaki 7-5, 6-3; France's Alize Cornet put out the sixth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3, 6-3.
