IMPHAL: Manipur chief minister   told the state assembly on Tuesday a new rehabilitation   in the state will come into effect from April 1. 

 The CM said as a part of the new policy, suitable stipends and proper skill development training will be imparted to the surrendered rebels. He also warned the police personnel not to threaten any surrendered militant living a settled life, failing which strict action will be taken up against those personnel. 
 
 Replying to the observation made by Congress MLA Abdul Nasir on the increase of drug abuse in the state, the CM clarified that police have been given adequate power to deal with the menace. The government has also strengthened the narcotics cell, he said, adding that setting up fasttrack courts in each district is not feasible now due to the shortage of manpower.
