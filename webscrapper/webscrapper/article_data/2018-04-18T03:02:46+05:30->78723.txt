MUMBAI: Hearing the metro car shed case, the   on Tuesday observed that going by earlier government documents, the state did not intend the   to be disturbed, and that any ecological threat to the land cannot be ignored. 

 The court directed activists to produce "official records and documents'' to substantiate their claim that the land was shown as "forest" in state records. 
 
 Activists also have to file an affidavit in support of the documents they produced to show that the state flouted environmental norms in permitting the car shed on 33 hectares of Aarey land. Saying that tweets cannot be used as official records, the court wondered "whether RTI replies, Google images, and photos submitted by the petitioners can be accepted as official records? They must put these on oath by way of an affidavit if they want to rely on them".
 
 A bench of Justices S C Dharamadhikari and P D Naik is hearing a PIL challenging the government's decision to modify the draft Development Plan 2034 for Mumbai to carve out an area as large as almost four Oval maidans in the city's green lung for a car shed for Metro 3 line which connects Cuffe Parade to Seepz via Bandra.
 
 Petitioners' counsel Janak Dwarkadas argued that the Aarey land was a "forest" by the definition applied from a Supreme Court verdict which said a forest need not be defined only by its dictionary meaning but also when land is cited as such in "official records". He said Aarey has been cited as "forest" in several records. The HC asked him to produce such "official records and documents'' to substantiate the claim. Justice Dharmadhikari, who also sought civic documents, said "as you are emphasizing, the milk colony land was not meant to be disturbed, now it is''.
 
 The activists are claiming that the state's decision to change the usage in Aarey from   to permit the car shed was illegal. The   (MMRC) told the HC their fears are unfounded.
 
 The next hearing will be on April 27.
