AHMEDABAD: Protests against the   government for alleged apathy in the self immolation of a   activist intensified on Sunday as protesters from the Dalit community tried to impose a bandh in Ahmedabad.

 
 However, police detained Dalit activist and   and hundreds of protesters on Sunday. Mevani, and his aides, were detained while they were on their way to the protest venue. Later, they were released.
 
 "We will not let the sacrifice of Bhanubhai (  who committed self-immolation) go in vain. The Gujarat government has shown its cruel face by detaining me and my supporters. We want resignation of Gujarat CM   and imposition of President's rule in the state," Mevani said.
 
 Around 40 protesters were detained from Sarangpur while 40 others were detained from Jashodanagar.
 
 In Vadaj, protesters set fire to a bike and a car. Many protesters were detained from Mehsana and Patan districts after they tried to block highways. At least 28 people were detained in Unjha, six in Mehsana and 29 in Patan. Around 30 people pelted stones at the BJP office in Patan. A constable was injured by a stone thrown by protesters in Patan. Heavy vehicles were stopped between Patan and Siddhpur after a mob blocked the highway. Women gheraoed Patan SP Ashwin Chauhan.
 
 Joint commissioner of police, crime branch, J K Bhatt said Mevani had misbehaved with cops while he was being detained. Mevani alleged he was manhandled by police and his car keys were broken. Bhatt said, "We had to detain Mevani along with his aides in public interest. While Mevani misbehaved, cops treated him with respect."
