MUMBAI: A civic clerk was trapped inside an elevator at   for nearly three hours on Tuesday. It is learned that municipal commissioner   had used the same lift a few minutes before the incident. 

 Around 11.15am, clerk Gajanan Chowdhary took the elevator from the ground floor to go to the second floor, where Mehta’s office is located, but it stopped midway. “The staff alerted the fire brigade and elevator servicemen, who took two-and-a-half hours to fix it and rescue him. During this period, we kept communicating with Chowdhary on the phone to keep him calm,” said a civic staffer. After being rescued, Chowdhary was taken to St George Hospital. He was soon discharged as he had not sustained any injuries. 
 
 Restoration of the century-old   was completed last year. Currently, the new annexe building is being restored.
