A workshop on making cinema an enjoyable experience for the differently abled was organised at   recently. Officials from the   (DFF),   and the   participated in the event.

  None of the theatres in Delhi screen movies which offer audio described performances, while it's a common practice in countries like the US and UK to organise special shows which also offer verbal descriptions of stage activities. One such show of 'Dangal' was organised for differently-abled children during the screening of National Award winning films.

  Talking about the workshop, which was organised before the screening of the film, Rumi Seth, founder and managing trustee, Saksham, said, "We have been working in this field for 13-14 years, and have done audio tracks of over 40 movies. It takes us around one month to complete the audio track of one movie. What people don't realise is that entertainment is as important for a differently abled person as it is for us. And so, we started doing audio performances for films. It's amazing how when we record the dialogues again in voice over, following the script, we become aware of the minute details of the film which were missed in the first place."
 
  C Senthil Rajan, director, DFF, told us, "It is part of our Access India campaign and we want to make cinema an enjoyable experience for people with disabilities. Last year, two films were screened at IFFI with audio described performances. We are planning to extend that."
