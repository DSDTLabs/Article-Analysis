LUCKNOW: Students planning to enrol in Lucknow University’s   this year will have to shell out more money. On Friday, LU raised the fee of self-finance courses by 30%. The hike was effected due to the financial crunch being faced by the university.

 It was also agreed in principle to introduce semester system in all undergraduate courses from academic session 2018-19.
 
 LU, in a press statement said, “The fee in almost all self-finance courses was not raised for more than last six years. On Friday, it was decided, in principle, to raise fee of self finance courses by 30% taking into account a hike of 5% per year for six years.”
 
 The decision to hike the fee came in a meeting of deans of all faculties, head of departments and coordinators with the vice-chancellor. Authorities said the fee hike is a result of financial burden on the university.
 
 To meet the expenditure, mostly the salary of teachers’, fee hike was important, said an official.
 
 In addition, university will also begin choice-based credit system (CBCS) in UG courses. Running UG courses on annual pattern was one of the many shortcomings pointed by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) committee during its inspection in March 2014.
 
 The team had strongly recommended introduction of semester system in UG courses.
