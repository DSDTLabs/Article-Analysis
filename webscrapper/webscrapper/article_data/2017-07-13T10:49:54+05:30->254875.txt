KOCHI: Personnel of the special investigation team, who were given custody of   till 11 am on Friday, had to wade through heavy public protest on Wednesday as they took the actor to various places where the alleged conspiracy to harm the actress was hatched.

 Immediately after the Angamaly judicial magistrate court granted them a two-day custody of Dileep, the SIT took him to Shanthigiri College in Thodupuzha. But the booing crowds in a menacing mood prevented cops from taking the actor on to the campus. The formality of evidence collection was completed in minutes and the actor was taken to Hotel Abad Plaza on M G Road, Kochi.
 
 Through a wall of khaki, Dileep was taken in to room number 410 where he had first plotted the conspiracy with Pulsar Suni.
 
 Despite his best efforts to put up a strong face, clear cracks of a crumbling person were visible on the actor. SIT also took him to Sift junction at Thoppumpady.
 
 Sources, meanwhile, told ToI that statement of Anwar Sadath MLA, currently on a foreign tour, would be recorded on his return. This is to bring clarity on phone calls reportedly made between him and the actor on the day the actress was raped, sources said.
 
 Earlier, Dileep was presented before the magistrate in the chambers. His bail plea will be heard on Friday. Meanwhile, advocate A Sureshan was appointed as the special public prosecutor in the case.
