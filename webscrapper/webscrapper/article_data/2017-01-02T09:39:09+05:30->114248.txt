JALANDHAR: All caution that the Congress is taking in announcing its candidates doesn't seem to be helping the party as signs of trouble are emerging from  , where party leadership otherwise believes they are in good stead. Congress has so far issued tickets in two lists, naming 69 candidates first and 16 in the second.

 On Sunday, 12 councillors and eight former councillors announced that in case the ticket from Jalandhar North constituency went to someone other than former minister Avtar Henry, who earlier won from the constituency thrice but lost last two elections, they would not “tolerate any other candidate“.
 
 The councillors, including leader of Congress councillors' group in Jalandhar municipal corporation Jadish Raj Raja, said a couple of leaders who had nothing to do with the constituency were now staking claim to the ticket.
 
 These ticket seekers were resorting to all sorts of lobbying, they said.
 
 Already sitting  , in place of whom the party ticket has been allotted to Satnam Singh Kainth, has announced that he would decide his next course of action after consulting his supporters. He is meet them at the function organized to mark the death anniversary of his father   on Wednesday .
 
 There has been opposition to candidates fielded in some other constituencies too. Family of former CM Surjit Barnala is unhappy over being denied ticket from Dhuri. The family was expecting a ticket for Simar Partap Singh Barnala -son of Gaganjeet Singh and grandson of Surjit Singh. There has been talk of Gaganjeet contesting as an independent from the constituency after the family tried to meet Congress leadership for a change in candidature but in vain.
