JODHPUR: A special SC/ST court on Wednesday directed the police here to register an FIR against Indian cricketer   for his alleged comment on Dr   Ambedkar. According to petitioner D R Meghwal, Pandya, on December 26, 2017, posted a comment on his twitter account, which insulted Ambedkar and hurt the sentiments of the people of his community. 

 
 “Which Ambedkar ??? The one who drafted a cross law and constitution or the one who spread the disease called reservation in the country,” Pandya purportedly posted on his twitter timeline. 
 
 Offended by this, Meghwal, who claims to be a member of   in Rajasthan’s Jalore district, moved an application against the cricketer on Tuesday. Meghwal stated in his complaint that by making this comment, a popular cricketer like Pandya has not only attempted to insult and disregard the constitution and the architect of the constitution deliberately but has also hurt the sentiments of the community he belongs to. 
 
 “I learnt about Pandya’s comment through social media in January. It appeared quite derogatory for a figure like Ambedkar and was an attempt to spread hatred and create division in the society,” said Meghwal, an advocate by profession. “By doing so, he has committed a serious crime and hurt the sentiments of my entire community,” Meghwal said, adding that Pandya should be given adequate and suitable punishment for his “crass act”.
