NAGPUR: “A person’s handwriting and signature can tell the story of his life. Even small changes in the mode of signature can bring a turnaround in the person’s life,” said graphologist   on Sunday.

 He was speaking on the importance of signature at a programme ‘The Science of Graphology’ at  , Civil Lines. Sixty people from all age groups attended the programme. 
 
 “People who use pointed alphabets in their signature are successful most of the times because their approach towards life is practical. On the other hand, people who use round alphabets are compassionate and think with their heart. It is an effective characteristic if one wants to become a successful businessman,” said Bansod.
 
 The graphologist suggested participants to use pointed alphabets in their signature to bring an aggressive approach in their life. “Handwriting must always be clear and confident in shape. It shows a person’s clarity of vision towards his aim,” he added.
 
 Analysing the signature of some audiences, Bansod told them to avoid the use of round alphabets in the first letter of their signature. “It becomes an obstacle in your success. Even if you obtain knowledge it will never thrive. Write the first letter of the signature big and sharp. It shows confidence,” said Bansod. 
 
 “If you bring these changes in your handwriting and signature I can guarantee you will see change in your life within 90 days,” said Bansod.
