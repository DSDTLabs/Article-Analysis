The accused generated bogus invoices through companies that existed on papers for availing input tax credit. The goods were not issued by the firms,” additional director general, DGGI Jaipur, Rajendra Kumar said on Monday.
 
 It is one of the major breakthroughs of DGGI Jaipur units since its establishment in Rajasthan.

 Tax consultant Khandelwal helped in firm registration through fake IDs and documents.
 
 The tax evaders had created firms in the name of their employees, neighbours and even people who died years ago, he added.
 
 ADG Kumar said that more arrests are likely in the case and it is yet to be examined whether the accused evaded VAT and Service Tax prior to GST implementation.
