PATNA: The only night flight, which began operating from the Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport from March 25 midnight, has failed to attract city residents. 

 According to an airport official, the night flight of Jet Airways on the Pune-Patna-Pune route received good response from flyers in the first week of its launch. It has, however, not been able to attract many passengers in the last few weeks.
 
 “The response is poor. Of the 150 seats in the flight, only around 70 were booked during departure and 60 during arrival on most days last week,” the official said on Monday.
 
 As per the data provided to this reporter, at least 61 passengers boarded the Jet Airways night flight on April 10, 67 on April 11, 71 on April 12, 66 on April 14 and 71 on April 15 from the city airport. The arrival of passengers from Pune to Patna has also come down from 100 on the inaugural day to 60.
 
 The official, however, claimed that flights on the same route get comparatively more bookings during daytime. “The passenger flow is likely to increase between May and June when people go on holidays,” he said.
 
 Patnaites citied safety concerns behind low turnout of passengers for  . “Reaching Patna at 1.30am and going back home is definitely unsafe. In other cities, travelling at night is not a problem,” said Abhishek Kumar Singh, a frequent flyer on the Patna-Pune route.
 
 Three more night flights on the Bengaluru-Patna-Bengaluru, Kolkata-Patna-Kolkata and Hyderabad-Patna-Hyderabad routes will start operating from the Patna airport from April 30.
