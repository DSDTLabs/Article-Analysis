CHENNAI: Port Blair is turning into an   for vacationers with air fares dropping after more flights were added on the   over the last few months following a request to airlines from the administration of the Union territory.

 About the steps taken by the administration to bring down fares, lieutenant   said he requested civil aviation minister Ashok   to introduce subsidised air fares for those travelling from other parts of the country to Port Blair. However, Raju instead suggested an increase in the number of flights to help slash fares.
 
 One direct flight to Port Blair from Mumbai and three flights via Chennai have been introduced. The three new flights operating through Chennai are from New Delhi, Goa and Hyderabad. Before the introduction of these new services, there were only nine services between Chennai and Port Blair per day. Now their numbers have increased to12 per day.
 
 While Port Blair is a favourite holiday destination for government staff taking their leave travel allowance (LTA), budget tourists are increasingly taking an interest as flights have become more affordable thanks to better connectivity. While fares on flights booked a month in advance have dropped, the difference is more significant on flights booked at short notice.Earlier tourists, officials or tra ders used to shell out up to Rs 25,000 as one-way fare from Port Blair to Chennai or Kolkata in such cases. Now the fares have come down to one fourth of that, Mukhi said.
 
 However, tour operators say that more flights are needed to make the fares competitive with weekend getaways to Southeast Asian destinations. Basheer Ahmed of Metro Travels said, “More flights will help cut fares further. For tourists, it is still cheaper to fly to Singapore or Malaysia than to Port Blair.One-way fare is as low as Rs 6,000 to Singapore and airlines are able to offer return fare in the range of Rs 14,000 to Singapore and Malaysia.“
