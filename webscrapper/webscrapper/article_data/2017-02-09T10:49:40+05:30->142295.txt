CHENNAI: With vertical development in cities leading to a drastic increase in energy consumption, there is a crying need for technology that can bring down costs by improving energy efficiency.   has taken up the challenge by devising a technology through which heating and cooling devices can be used optimally to reduce both   and the harm posed to the environment.

 The research has been ongoing for the last 10 years and will see fruition this year, with Anna University planning to launch a working model of this ‘energy storage’ technology on the university campus to demonstrate how the system works, and record how much power was saved. It can help not only large apartments or offices, but also infrastructure that requires specific low-temperature conditions like seafood warehouses and vaccine storage facilities which could avert problems like waste and spoilage, says V Kumaresan, a thermal engineering faculty member who co-heads the project.
 
 This technology will not only store energy, but also act as a drawing source, Kumaresan says. In households or commercial buildings, ACs working through evening to night will continuously be ‘charging’ the tank with the cool energy which can be stored for use during the day as the cooling source. “Not only can the power usage be brought down to 60% , we can also cut down the carbon dioxide and CFC (chlorofluorocarbons) discharge,” he adds.
 
 Enforcement, says Kumaresan, is the main cog in the wheel. “If there’s a strong policy mandating large buildings to use this kind of tech, we would be taking less power from the grid and can spare several megawatts of electricity to places which still don’t have continuous power supply,” he adds.
