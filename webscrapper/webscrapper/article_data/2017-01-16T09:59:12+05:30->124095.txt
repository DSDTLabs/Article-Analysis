BAREILLY: The possibility of a poll pact between   in Uttar Pradesh, which could be formalized early next week, has triggered a fresh churning in the regional SP unit. Potential candidates on the seats which the party might concede to Congress after the alliance are now eyeing other seats on which SP already has more that two contenders.
 
  Even as talks of an alliance are on, SP candidate Anil Sharma, who was earlier vying for Bareilly City seat, has now shifted attention to other seats. It is widely believed that SP would concede the Bareilly City seat to Congress if the alliance is forged and former mayor Supriya Aron is most likely to contest from it.
  
  Sharma, say sources, is now eyeing Bareilly Cantt seat where mayor IS Tomar is supposed to contest on a SP ticket.
  
  Sharma who claims to have the backing of corporators from the party is now preparing to take on Tomar, the city’s mayor whose name had figured in chief minister Akhilesh Yadav’s list. “More than 40 corporators have backed my candidature me in writing to contest from the seat. I had contested from Bareilly City last time and ensured a respectable finish as against the abysmal performances in the past.”
  
    had retained the urban seats with Arun Kumar winning from Bareilly City and   winning from Bareilly Cantt seat. SP candidates had performed poorly in these two urban seats in the previous assembly polls.
  
  Congress has, however, claimed that it will hopefully get three of the nine assembly seats in Bareilly region. “Apart from the two urban seats where only Congress can take on BJP, we will look forward to getting one urban seat as well if the alliance is forged,” said Chaudhary Aslam, Congress’ city unit president.
