The   has planned to deliver bills to its consumers through email. Officials said this will help consumers know their bills before the printed one arrives so that they can pay their bills quickly.

 Discomâ€™s superintending engineer   said consumers will have to register their email ID through which they wish to receive their bills. The move comes after consumers made demands for detailed electricity bills. The company already provides bills via SMS, but due to the lack of a proper system, not all consumers receive them.
 
 Improper meter readings has been listed as another reason why paper bills have not been reaching consumers on time. Some consumers even started to get accumulated electricity bills which over time started to become a problem.
 
 The company has also decided to use WhatsApp to ensure consumers get detailed bills on time. They will also be given assisitance on how they can register their numbers with the company server. Indore has more than five lakh domestic consumers registered with MPPKVVCL.
