PANAJI: The state government has sought an opinion from advocate general Saresh Lotlikar to approach the   (SC) to review its order to close all bars within 500m from national highways. Speaking to TOI, chief minister   said, “We are exploring all possibilities. Let the new government take a decision.”

 Parsekar said that his government has collected data to subtiantiate its claims in the apex   when the state files its appeal. He also said that the Goa   Traders Association (GLTA) should not criticized the   government as it was not a party in the matter.
 
 The newly-formed taluka-level committees have begun to conduct a survey to list liquor bars and wine shops that are located within 500m of national and state highways. 
 
 As per the apex court order, liquor shops which fall within 500m of highways would have to be close down in the new financial year. The number is not known, though there are an estimated 3,000 or so. Goa has around 11,000 excise licencees.
 
 The GLTA on Saturday formed a 12-member committee to identify the number of liquor retailers and distributors in the state who are affected by the Supreme Court's order.
 
 The association criticized the outgoing Bharatiya Janta Party government for not being “proactive in challenging” the Supreme Court's order and threatened to block highways if they did not get relief. The BJP, in it election manifesto, said that its government would explore legal options including approching the apex court to seek amendment of its order.
