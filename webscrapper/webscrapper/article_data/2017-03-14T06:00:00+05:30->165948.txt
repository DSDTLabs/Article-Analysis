Kolkata: The next three days are expected to be pleasant, and the nights slightly nippy, with the maximum temperature hovering around 30°C and the minimum below 19°C. There may be sporadic clouds later in the week, but they will not bring any rain. In fact, the Met office ruled out any further rain till the Nor’westers lash the city later this month or sometime in April. 

 Kolkata woke up to a chilly morning on Holi as the minimum temperature plunged to 18.6°C. Officials at the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Alipore said the continued flow of north-westerly winds will keep the day temperatures in check for the next 72 hours. The maximum temperature on Monday was 29.1°C.
 
 People had been on tenterhooks, fearing a wet Holi, ever since three thundershowers struck the city last week, resulting in record March rainfall. Revellers were, however, glad that the wet spell ended by Sunday, when Kolkata celebrated Dol. Monday remained dry and sunny, allowing Holi celebrations to proceed uninterrupted. 
 
 The low-pressure trough between Jharkhand and north Bengal that had triggered last week’s thundershowers has moved towards Bay of Bengal. “Every low-pressure trough ushers in north-westerly winds. This one was no exception. So, this chill was expected. But it will not last. It will start getting warmer from Tuesday, but the   will remain moderate till the end of the week,” said G K Das, director, RMC.
