Lucknow: Probe in the mass cloning cyber   has thrown up names of four bank branches in the city. For the past 10 days, Hazratganj-based   has been flooded with complaints about fraudulent transactions through debit card even though the ATM card remained in possession of the victims throughout. It was found that the money was withdrawn in Vadodara, Gujarat, in all the cases and a majority of transactions were valued Rs 40,000. The fraud occurred between April 1 and 5.

 As at least 60 complaints have been received, police coordinated with the bank. “The customers who have been targeted had savings account in one of the four branches which are located at Ashok Marg, Jawahar Bhawan, Secretariat or Aminabad,” said in-charge of the cell, VVS Sirohi. The chief manager of the said bank, Ashish Mishra, is expected to furnish details of all such cases in the next few days.
 
 Though cloning is becoming commonplace with the use of skimmers at commercial establishments, securing PINs is not possible without placing snooping devices inside ATM booths. “The only ways to go about this kind of a fraud is either by installing some electronic devices at ATM booths or by hacking into the database of the bank,” said additional superintendent Triveni Singh who heads the cyber wing of the special task force.
