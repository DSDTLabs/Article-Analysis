MUMBAI: BEST, which had the highest   in the   until a year ago, will provide the cheapest residential   in the state from April 1. The rates will be slashed by up to 7%—following up on the 18-24% dip last October—as per directives of the state power regulator MERC.

 As the undertaking supplies electricity only in the island city, tony areas of south Mumbai will now get cheaper power than the suburbs. Consequently, a south Mumbai household that paid a base tariff of Rs 2,325 for consuming 300 units a month a year ago, will have to pay around Rs 1,600 (Rs 700 less) from April. In comparison, a Navi Mumbai household consuming the same amount of electricity will have to pay more than Rs 2,000, as MSEDCL’s tariff will be the highest. 
 
 “It is good news for BEST as the   tariff rates will help keep a check on migration,” said BEST general manager Jagdish Patil, adding the low rates would help attract more customers and increase sales. 
 
 Pointing to the direct competition between   and Reliance Energy in the suburbs, where BEST has no presence, an expert said, “Tata Power is set to hike its tariff by around 15% for low-end residential consumers (101-300 unit use category) from next month. But despite the hike, it will still be the cheapest in the suburbs.”
 
 A Tata Power spokesperson said: “The MERC has approved an overall increase in the average tariff (including regulatory asset charge) of 2.26% for Tata Power for 2017-18. The commission has sought to bring rationalisation of tariff structure across all power utility firms." While not commenting on BEST, the spokesperson said: “Tata Power continues to offer lowest residential tariff as compared to Reliance Energy.” 
 
 Sources said the hike for Reliance Energy will be "marginal" and this could come as a reprieve to more than two million residential consumers in the suburbs. Sources in Reliance Energy said it offered a competitive tariff for high-end consumers in the suburbs. “The good news is that there is marginal hike this year and in the long term, there will be a dip of 17% in tariff in 2019-20,” a source said, adding that Reliance had nearly 30 lakh consumers in the suburbs, with the high-end users being celebrities and film personalities who enjoy the benefits of cheaper power. 
 
 The tariff for MSEDCL consumers in Bhandup-Mulund belt, Thane and Navi Mumbai will also be increased marginally (3 to 6 paise per unit) from next month, sources added. 
 
 As per the tariff order, Tata Power's commercial user category tariff had increased to Rs 11.84 in 2016-17 and will peak to Rs 12.85 in 2018-19 but drop to Rs 10.36 per unit in 2019-20. Reliance Energy’s commercial user tariff has increased to Rs 10.59 this fiscal year but will reduce to Rs 9.81 in 2018-19 and subsequently to Rs 8.29 in 2019-20. The industry tariff for both Tata Power and Reliance consumers will also gradually decrease in the next four years, the order stated.
