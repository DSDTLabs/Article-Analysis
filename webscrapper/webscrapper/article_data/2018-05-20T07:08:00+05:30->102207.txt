GHAZIABAD: More than 100 residents of   residential society, situated on Loni-Bhopura road in Sahibabad, have fallen   in the past three days allegedly after drinking contaminated   supplied to their homes by the maintenance agency.

 
 According to the residents, out of 100 who are ill, more than 50 are children, and all of them are suffering from dysentery, stomach ache and vomiting.
 
 “My two sons, Shivansh and Vikrant, aged four and six years respectively, are suffering from the ailments arising out of   water. We have visited the doctor, but there is hardly any improvement in their condition so far. The water being supplied to our house has a foul smell. As the water is supplied in the society through borewell, it seems that it has got contaminated due to some fault in the supply line,” said Ruby Kaushik, a resident. 
 
 Ramesh Tiwari, a retired Army major and a resident of the society, said, “We have come to know that the contamination has taken place due to some problem with the sewerage treatment plant and sewerage water has got mixed up with the water pipeline. My wife Gita (56) too is suffering from dysentery.”
 
 When contacted, Rajesh Singh, marketing manager,   City, said: “Now the situation has improved. When residents complained that contaminated water is being supplied to their home, we stopped the supply from that particular borewell and started giving water from another one. Moreover, we have collected some samples and sent them to a private lab for testing. The results are expected by Tuesday.” 
 
 Looking at the severity of the problem, the maintenance company has arranged for a doctor’s consultation for residents for three days starting Saturday. 
 
 Chief medical officer (CMO) N K Gupta said he would send a team on Sunday to conduct an inspection of the residential society.
 
 There are over 1,900 flats and over 1,000 families are staying in the society.
