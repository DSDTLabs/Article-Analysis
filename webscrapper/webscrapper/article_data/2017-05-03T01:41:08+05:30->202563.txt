MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court to challenge a stay by the Bombay high court of its April 27-28 rule and notice making   for   in the state. 

 The high court had, at a special hearing on Sunday, stayed the state’s decision that made over 700 medical graduates from colleges in the state, ineligible for PG seats in the state.
 
 The SC directed that the state’s special leave petition (SLP) be listed for a Friday hearing. It means the HC stay continues to operate and the merit list published on Sunday needs to be revised taking non-domiciled graduates into consideration. The admission process has to be completed between May 2 and May 7, in keeping with the deadline set by the SC.
 
 The HC holiday bench had found the state’s belated decision “arbitrary and unsustainable’’ especially when admission process had begun. For domicile, a person must have resided in Maharashtra for at least 15 years. 
 
 The state, in its SLP filed through advocate Nishant Katneshwarkar, is arguing that it is “empowered to prescribe state quota seats in government colleges, private unaided colleges, deemed universities and minority institutions”. 
 
 It says “the intention was that if more local candidates get admission in the prescribed PG medical courses, then more doctors will be available for providing medical services to the people in Maharashtra.” The state had thus decided to give admission to students domiciled in Maharashtra up to 67.5 % seats. The DMER issued a government resolution on April 27 to allow non-domiciled students admissions in a 17.5% management quota in private colleges.
