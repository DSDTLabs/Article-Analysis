LUCKNOW: The city failed miserably in   scoring a poor 444 marks out of 900, way less than UP's highest scorer Varanasi with 718 marks and country's highest scorer Chandigarh with 883 marks. 

 This is primarily for two reasons-LMC's failure to run city's waste treatment plant despite commissioning it in 2011 and secondly its laxity in prompting the contractor to cover maximum wards of city under door-to-door collection programme. At the time of the survey, the private company Jyoti Envirotech was covering only half the wards and was not processing the waste regularly but dumping it on the ground near the plant. 
 
 In the overall score of 2,000, sanitation carried highest marks, 900 and was to be judged mainly on three parameters-370 marks for sweeping and waste collection, 180 marks for waste treatment and 270 marks for eradication of open defecation. Lucknow scored abysmally at 273, 71 and 30 marks in the above mentioned parameters, respectively. Remaining 90 marks were for the municipal body's performance. 
 
  claimed that at the time of survey, Jyoti's contract was terminated because of its failure to run the plant to full capacity and was given to a new company Eco-Green. Because of the transition, the new company was unable to take charge fully, hence at most places, garbage was found spilling on streets. Citizens refuted LMC's claims saying LMC is equally responsible for the garbage piles as it couldn't fix loopholes in waste management over last seven years. 
 
 LMC also reported that the previous company had ceased to run the plant a few months ago and was letting waste collected to pile up near the plant. During inspection, it was found that the plant was running at just one-third capacity. The new company which says that almost 50,000 tonnes of garbage was lying near the plant when it took charge.
