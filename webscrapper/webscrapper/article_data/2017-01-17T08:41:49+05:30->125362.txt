MUMBAI: Three schoolchildren were injured when a 19-year-old, who was learning to drive, ran them over in   early on Monday. While the driver,  , has been arrested, his companion who was teaching him to drive, without being authorized to do so, is on the run, said the police.

 The injured children, sustained fractures to the legs, have been admitted to a private hospital. While   (7) has fractured the left leg, her sister Mahima(9) fractured both legs. The third, Ganesh Yadav , whose age was not known, has sustained minor injuries to the right leg.
 
 Deputy Commissioner of police,  , said that Khan's friend was teaching him to drive the tourist car on Annabhau Sathe Marg when Khan lost control over the car and hit the three children who were on their way to school.
 
 Khan, instead of applying the brakes, hit the accelerator, making the car spin out of control, said Umap.
 
 While a few passersby caught Khan, the other man who was with him in the car fled from the scene. The police said that the car was not meant for a learner. "A learner's car at a motor driving school has two sets of brakes. In case of an emergency, the trainer to can screech the car to a halt. But such a facility was lacking in this car," said a police official.
 
 The police said that Khan did not possess a valid licence. He was sent for a blood test which has ruled out the presence of alcohol in his blood.
 
 Khan and his instructor have been booked for rash driving and negligence under the Indian Penal Code and other sections under the Motor Vehicles Act.
