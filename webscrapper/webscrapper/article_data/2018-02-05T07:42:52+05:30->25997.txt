LUCKNOW: The   who had jumped into the Gomti holding one son, after pushing the elder, could not be traced on Sunday even though   kept searching in the 8-km stretch on both ends of   in Madiyaon. It is not yet known if the officer had drowned since he is an expert swimmer and had won medals in swimming competitions as well.

 The divers in the team used deep diving gear, oxygen cylinders and victim-locating cameras but could not trace the man in 40s.
 
 Second-in-command, Bishambar Dayal Maurya recently got posted as staff officer of DIG Lucknow group and joined the CRPF centre at Bijnaur in the city.
 
 A native of Malihabad, Maurya had an argument with his wife on Saturday following which he left his father-in-law’s house along with his two sons and jumped into the river in the evening. His seven-year-old elder son survived but the fouryear-old perished and his body was fished out.
 
 Inspector general CRPF, central sector, Subhash Chandra, who was supervising the rescue operation, said, “About 15 men have been working in shifts to trace Maurya. All necessary safety and security gear have been provided to them.”
 
 RP Bharti, deputy commandant of NDRF’s 11Battalion said that the operation was initiated at 6am and ended around 9pm.
 
 “It becomes difficult to check the riverbed in the night,” said Bharti. Three boats, including a motorized steamer, were pressed into service. While some members kept observing the screen of their laptop, their counterparts plunged into deep waters with victim location cameras. The rescue team left no stone unturned in trying to locate Maurya. The operation would resume on Monday, said Bharti.
