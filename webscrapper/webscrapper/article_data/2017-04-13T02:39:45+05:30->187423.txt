GURUGRAM: Five   employees were   on Wednesday in Gurugram after the union continued with its state-wide strike for the third consecutive day. 

 Commuters had to bear the brunt as around 262 buses, which included both city buses and inter-state buses, of Haryana   remained off road on Wednesday. In Gurgaon, nine unions of roadways   have joined hands to form a joint action committee, that is participating in the strike since Monday evening, protesting against the 273 permits being issued to private transporters.
 
 Commuters, who had reached the bus stand in Old Gurgaon to board a bus for their home town, had to avail other modes of transport like autos and cabs to commute till the Metro stations or ISBT bus stand in Delhi’s Kashmere Gate.
 
 Some passengers heading towards Delhi and Himachal Pradesh boarded Metro trains to Kashmere Gate from   Metro station. Those heading towards Rajasthan boarded the buses plying on Delhi-Jaipur and Delhi-Alwar routes. The worst affected were those who had to go to Anand Vihar bus terminal and Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station, who had no other option but to board DTC buses to reach Anand Vihar.
 
 “I had reached here hoping to take a bus to Bhiwani but found that the buses were not plying. Now, I’ll have go to Kashmere Gate ISBT to look for other means. My whole day has been wasted and I won’t be home till late in the night,” said Ram Nayak, who had reached the old bus stand here around 1pm.
 
 “We will not end our strike till our demands are met. The government has decided to give permits to private buses but does not realise there will be revenue loss not only for us but for the government too,” said Jaiprakash, member of joint action committee, Gurgaon.
