JAIPUR:   distribution, CNG-run transportation and clean energy driven industrial activity is set to transform   as a gas economy as 11 districts in the six geographical areas in the state has been selected for bidding by  .

 Even though, this is a nationwide initiative by the oil ministry, Rajasthan will be major beneficiary as the state’s gas network is currently limited to   having the city gas distribution facility. The availability of CNG for transportation is again available only at two locations such as Neemrana and Jaipur.
 
 “This augurs well for Rajasthan, which has almost negligible gas footprint. Through our efforts, we could bring CNG to the state with two stations. But for a state-wide network, it requires lot of investments for developing the infrastructure. The 9th round of biddings CGD, CNG stations and pipelines will bring in private players who will create that infrastructure and provide gas,” said Ravi Agarwal, managing director of  .
 
 A pre-bid conference has been scheduled in Delhi on May 14 for getting feedback from the prospective bidders and after incorporating the suggestions, the final tender will be issued for bidders to participate. 
 
 Even though four cities in Rajasthan has been declared as smart cities, there is no gas network which is critical to keep the cities clean. Transportation in the state is also driven by traditional fuels in the absence of CNG network. “The private companies will build pipelines and set up CNG stations not only in the cities but also in the geographical area (GA). For example, Jaipur and Alwar are GAs meaning not only the two cities will be covered by the network but also the total area, including small places in between. Earlier, it was city specific but now the approach is to expand the area under the new tendering process,” added Agarwal.
