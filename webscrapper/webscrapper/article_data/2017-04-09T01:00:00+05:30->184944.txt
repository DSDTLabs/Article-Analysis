Music composer and singer  , who broke into the   50 Charts, walked for Lalit Dalmia's show at the recently-concluded DT PCJ India Showcase Week 2017. He was at the venue for a little while. The singer said, "I was in the capital for a performance. I rushed for the show soon after. I rarely come to Delhi now. I have been busy with work, aur Dilli mein concert hote hain toh logon ko   aur Yo Yo chahiye."
