LUDHIANA: With model code of conduct still in effect, the Ludhiana municipal corporation is going to give a miss to the annual flower and baby show this year. For the past five years, MC officials have been organising the   in the month of March.

 In the past two years, the event has got overwhelming response from city residents.
 
 The officials claimed that firstly, they cannot spend money on organizing such events and secondly they could not make any preparations. They have to invite park management committees, schools, colleges, institutes and residents for participating in the event which takes a lot of time.
 
 The flower lovers, however, are a little bit disappointed. A homemaker and resident of BRS   said, “Even last year, I could not participate because I did not receive information on time. I was hoping to take part this time, but now the MC is not going to organize the event.“ A chartered accountant Anup   said very few events are organized by authorities here and elections should not leave any impact on these events. He demanded that officials should organize the flower show this year also.
 
 Executive engineer of horticulture branch Surinder Kumar said, “Due to model code of conduct, they cannot spend money on organizing any event. He claimed that moreover staff remained in busy in election duty so they did not get time to make adequate arrangements.“
