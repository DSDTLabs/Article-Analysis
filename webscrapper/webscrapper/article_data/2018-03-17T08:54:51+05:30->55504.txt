CHENNAI: A day after T T   launched his new party and unfurled its flag, the AIADMK approached the Madras high court to restrain him from using the the flag, claiming that it was deceptively similar to that of the ruling party. 

 A civil suit moved by chief minister and party joint coordinator Edappadi K   also wanted the court to impose 25 lakh as damages on   for exploiting the goodwill of AIADMK. As the petitioner is an association of people, a separate leave application seeking permission of the court to sue on behalf of the party was moved on Friday. Allowing the application, Justice   directed the party to issue notices of the suit in an English daily and a regional daily and posted the suit for hearing to March 20. 
 
 Alleging that Dhinakaran had misused the flag even during the RK Nagar byelection, Palaniswami said if he was allowed to use the deceptive, misleading flag with an intent to piggyback on the goodwill and reputation of AIADMK, which was acquired through four decades of hard work and seven successful terms in government, it would cause irreparable damage to the interests of AIADMK. The petitioner wanted the court to grant an interim injunction against the use of such flag till the final disposal of the suit.
 
 Pointing out that the Delhi high court had only permitted Dhinakaran to use the 'pressure cooker' symbol and not the AIADMK's name or flag, Palaniswami said the R K Nagar legislator on the other hand intended to misuse AIADMK's flag thereby deceiving public. 
 
 "The entire exercise by Dhinakaran has been to have a separate identity for his group, but while doing so, just as the symbol and name, he ought to have a unique flag, he cannot have right over the flag of AIADMK," he said.
