Vadodara: Western Railway has decided to add extra coaches in Mahamana Express that runs between Vadodara and Varanasi. 

 The superfast train that was flagged off last year will now run with 20 coaches. Earlier, the train which runs on weekly basis, had sleeper, first AC, second AC and general coaches but AC 3 tier coaches were missing in the train. 
 
 Now, two AC 3 tier coaches have been added to the train on permanent basis. 
 
 While the two new coaches were added when the train started its onward journey to Varanasi from Vadodara on March 4 as train number 20903, the train will return to Vadodara from Varanasi with added coaches on March 16 as train number 20904. It was in September last year that union railway minister Piyush Goyal had flagged off the train from Vadodara railway station to run between Vadodara and Varanasi. TNN
