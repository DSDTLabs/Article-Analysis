CHANDIGARH: Residents of   (west) are struggling to get a security   constructed near the HIG upper and lower flats which the Chandigarh housing board (CHB) had left put when the sector was constructed. Even as the residents claimed that it was a part of the proposed plan of the sector, the authorities have not initiated any deliberation to construct the wall that has been demanded by the residents since long.

 The residents have been demanding the wall near the HIG upper and lower flats as rest of the sector is already surrounded by a wall and barbed wires. The residents said CHB should erect the wall in the remaining portion too for the safety of the residents there. But, no action has been taken so far, they said.
 
 Manmohan Luthra, a resident, said in recent days, a number cases of snatching have been reported in the area in which the residents of the nearby slum dwellers were involved. “After this, the demand to keep the gates installed in the area shut between 11am to 5pm has also been raised,” he said.
 
 General secretary active resident welfare association   said the construction of boundary wall in the area should be approved by the authorities. It has been left out for a long time and is much needed for the safety now. The senior citizens of the area said earlier, staff from the police department used to visit their houses to make them feel safe at home. He demanded this system should be started again.
