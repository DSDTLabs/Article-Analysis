Thane: A 47-year-old   coach, Sarvjeet Singh, was arrested by the Rabodi police for allegedly molesting a 13-year-old girl and blackmailing her since 2015 with her semi-nude photographs. The victim’s mother registered a complaint against the   who would come home to teach her daughter martial arts since 2015.

 “Singh misused his proximity as a coach and reportedly told the victim that he would train her good and put her on a higher pedestal in martial arts if he would get sexual favours in return from her. The victim’s mother wasn’t aware of this agreement. Meanwhile, Singh used to touch the victim inappropriatly whenever he wanted. He even asked the victim to send her semi-nude pictures which he saved in his phone,” said senior inspector RM Somvanshi of the Rabodi police station.
 
 “The mother, however, found out how the coach would exploit his physical proximity with her daughter and   her when Singh posted her daughter’s semi-nude pictures on social media. When she confronted Singh, she was threatened,” police said.
 
 The victim filed a complaint against Singh on Thursday after which the police arrested him after laying a trap, added Somvanshi. — Souvik Sarkar
