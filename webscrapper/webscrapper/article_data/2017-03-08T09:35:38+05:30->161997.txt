Deputy superintendent of police  , who allegedly demanded 50,000 from an advocate to comply with a   order, absconded after he came to know that it was a trap laid by the   Wing (DVAC) to nab him. DVAC officials said S Dhakshnamoorthy, 52, of Vellore, bought a 2.48 acre plot in   village in 2008. But his neighbours claimed ownership of a portion of the land and prevented him from erecting a fence around it. 

 He approached the high court which ruled in his favour in August 2016. It also directed Vellore superintendent of police P Pakalavan and inspector Murugesan to provide adequate protection to his land.
 
 Police, however, made Dhakshnamoorthy run from pillar to post before demanding a bribe of 50,000. "The DSP demanded 10,000 for the   police station and 40,000 for the inspector. He asked the complainant to hand over the bribe to him," said a police official quoting the complainant. Since January 3, the SP served three memos asking the DSP and inspector to comply with the HC order. 
 
 On February 28, Dhakshnamoorthy approached DVAC sleuths, who after a preliminary probe, found the DSP had demanded the bribe. 
 
 On Tuesday, the DVAC laid a trap to nab the DSP red-handed, but the officer went on leave and his whereabouts are not known.
