 Kapoor’s daughter   had been kept away from the prying eyes of the paparazzi since her birth. However, the actor recently shared a photograph of the six-month-old infant on his official social media handles, which showed his wife   and daughter captured in an adorable pose and the picture was accompanied by the words, “Hello World”. 

 When BT asked Shahid if he felt reluctant to introduce his baby to the world, pat came the reply, “You want her to feel normal, but everyone talks about her so much that you get worried about her having to deal with that baggage. I just hope that Misha can be as normal as possible. That’s the only wish I have for her. I hope she can enjoy life like a normal child.” 
 
 This is not the first time the actor has expressed his need to be a protective father. He had expressed his annoyance with paparazzi and said that the flash from the cameras can be detrimental to a newborn.
