NEW DELHI: The Centre is expected to provide a major push to development in seven states in the eastern part of India when it presents the budget for 2018-19 as it focusses on transforming 200 districts as part of its ‘New India’ strategy.

 The plan, which has been in the works for some time now, will focus on “tweaking” expenditure to ensure that states such as  ,   and some in the northeast receive adequate attention. The strategy could include diverting funds from “obsolete” schemes to focus on new plans and programmes in the districts that have been identified by Niti Aayog.
 
 While the government will present the budget against the backdrop of a tight fiscal situation, sources said funds would be made available for schemes across farm, social sectors and infrastructure. Sources said allocation for existing development schemes will be a priority and new schemes may also be unveiled as part of the strategy. “Finding the resources for this strategy will be a priority,” said an official, who did not wish to be identified. 
 
 There is a view within the government that states on the eastern side of the country and 200 districts need to develop at a much faster pace to enable overall economic growth to reach 9%-10% in the medium term. Most of these states need a major revamp in their infrastructure as well as upgrade in sectors such as health, education, nutrition as well as improvement in connectivity.
 
 The renewed development focus on seven states will begin at a time when preparations for the 2019 general elections will start and ties in with the NDA’s focus on the eastern part of the country.
 
 Prime Minister   has given a call for a ‘New India’ by 2022, with a focus on balanced development across the country. 
 
 The government think tank, Niti Aayog, is working on a ranking of these backward districts. They will be ranked on a real-time basis for their performance compared with the most developed areas.
