NEW DELHI / BENGALURU: Putting to rest a 126-year-old emotive dispute over sharing of  , the   on Friday increased Karnataka’s entitlement by 14.75tmcft to 284.75tmcft, reduced Tamil Nadu’s share to 404.25tmcft, while keeping unchanged the allocation of 30tmcft to Kerala and 7tmcft to Puducherry. The   allowed re-examination of allocations after 15 years — in 2033.

 A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Amitava Roy and AM Khanwilkar delivered a unanimous verdict, making very little change to the 2007 award of the   Water Disputes   (CWDT). Of the total available 740tmcft water, the tribunal had allotted   419tmcft,   270tmcft, Kerala 30tmcft and Puducherry 7tmcft, while keeping aside 10tmcft for environment protection and 4tmcft as inevitable discharge into the sea.
  
  
 Authoring a 465-page judgment, CJI Misra said Karnataka’s share was increased by 14.75tmcft because the tribunal had not taken into account two crucial factors — availability of 10tmcft groundwater to TN from the Cauvery basin, and 4.75tmcft water required to meet the drinking water requirements of globally renowned IT City Bengaluru.
 
 Justifying higher allocation to Karnataka, the SC said, “Drinking water requirement of the overall population of all the states has to be placed on a higher pedestal, as we treat it as a hierarchically fundamental principle of equitable distribution.” It found fault in the tribunal’s approach that only one-third of Bengaluru city fell within the Cauvery basin, and also its presumption that 50% of drinking water needs could be met from groundwater supply.
 
 
 
 Keeping in mind the global status the city has attained, an additional 4.75tmcft is awarded to Karnataka, the SC bench said.
 
 The CJI-led bench said, “In view of the allocation of additional 14.75tmcft water to Karnataka, the state would now be required to release 177.25tmcft water (instead of 192tmcft it used to release earlier as per the tribunal award) at the inter-state border with Tamil Nadu — that is at Biligundlu.” The allocation would remain in force for 15 years. The states could seek reconsideration of the allocation only in 2033.
 
 Earlier, 192tmcft water used to be released from Biligundlu to Tamil Nadu as per the tribunal orders in this manner — January 3tmcft, February, March, April and May 2.5tmcft each, June 8tmcft, July 34tmcft, August 50tmcft, September 40tmcft, October 22tmcft and November 15tmcft. The SC said that since the total release from Biligundlu has been reduced to 177.25tmcft, monthly releases would be proportionately reduced.
 
 Rejecting the Centre’s stand it had the discretion to frame a scheme for implementation of the judgment allocating Cauvery water, the CJI-led bench said: “We direct that a scheme shall be framed by the central government within a span of six weeks from today, so that authorities under the scheme can see to it that the present decision which has modified the award passed by the Tribunal is smoothly made functional, and rights of states as determined by us are appositely carried out.”
 
 It said no extension of the six-week time frame would be granted on any ground.
 
 The SC said Karnataka cannot fault the 1892 and 1924 agreements with TN (earlier part of Madras Presidency) now as it never questioned it after Independence in 1947, or after the formation of Karnataka in 1956. However, it said that since the 1924 agreement was contemplated to remain in existence for 50 years, it expired in 1974.
 
 Rejecting the states’ arguments faulting the approach of the tribunal, which was formed in 1990 and gave its award in 2007, the SC said, “We are of the opinion that the tribunal was correct in its approach.”
