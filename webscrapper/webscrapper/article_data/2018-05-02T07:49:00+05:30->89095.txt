Ludhiana: Many members of a family had a narrow escape after fire broke out in a house in Purani Sarai of Khanna late on Monday evening. It took fire tenders some time to douse the flames. As per information, Saroj Bala — wife of Ramesh Kumar — was boiling milk on the gas at around 7pm on Wednesday. When she felt there was some leakage in the gas pipe, she called up her husband who was somewhere outside.

 Some residents said by the time Saroj’s husband came, her daughter Geeta saw flames emanating from the cylinder. They added that as Geeta tried to put off the fire by wrapping a jute bag around the same, the fire actually spread. An area resident said when inmates in the same building heard about the fire, they tried to run to safer places from the first floor, where the fire had broken out. He added that later, area residents informed the fire brigade and tried to douse the fire on their own.
 
 As per residents, Varun Sharma, family member of Ramesh Kumar, received burn injuries in the arms after he tried to control the fire. Fire department officials said a team of the department, led by Yashpal Rai, reached the spot and started controlling the flames. They added that three fire tenders from Khanna and one from Samrala was soon pressed into service to put off the fire. Fire department officials later removed cylinders lying inside the house. They added that there was no loss to human lives in the incident.
