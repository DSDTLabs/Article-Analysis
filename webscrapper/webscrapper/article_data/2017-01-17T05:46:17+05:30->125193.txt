MUMBAI: A day after two flamingos were found with wounds by  , a senior official from the state forest department ordered that a criminal case be registered against unidentified persons. 

 "I have instructed my officials to register an offence under the Wildlife Protection Act," chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell), N Vasudevan, said on Monday. He said it was the first flamingo poaching case reported. "We will probe if the injuries were indeed caused by a pellet. If so, it is a serious matter," he said, adding that vigilance would now be beefed up.
 
 A wildlife activist said that though the   had been declared a 'reserved forest', guards were armed with just sticks and were no match for poachers.
 
 The two injured birds are recovering slowly, said Dr Rina Dev, who is treating them at her clinic in Bandra. 
 
 "One bird has a torn muscle but no fracture," Dr Dev said. "It can stand for a while but not for long. The other will be operated in a day or two."
 
 Pawan Sharma of Resqink  , which rescued the birds, said it was shocking that poachers shot at migratory birds in a protected area.
