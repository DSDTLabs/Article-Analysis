 The RBI governor made the promise in his reply to the minister's letter demanding a reduction in the 'high' capital adequacy ratio prescribed for cooperative banks for the year 2016-17, said an official release issued from the minister's office here on Thursday.
 
 The RBI had said that by March 31, 2017, the minimum capital adequacy of cooperative banks should be at 9% of  . "It was 7% on March 31, 2016, which all cooperative banks in the state were able to comply with. However, the   drive and other restrictions imposed on cooperative banks, especially on the district banks, jeopardised their financial planning and had an impact on their profit efficiency," the minister's letter to the RBI governor had pointed out.
 
 The demonetisation of high value currencies and subsequent reduction in repayment led to an upsurge in the banks' NPAs (non-performing assets), depletion of capital and a difficult situation for attaining the prescribed minimum capital adequacy ratio, the letter had said.
