DEHRADUN:   CM   on Sunday said that in order to tackle the growing problem of   from hill villages, his government will soon create a separate ministry for employment generation and skill development. “Migration should be by choice, not by compulsion. Our endeavour is not just to provide employment to the youth but also social security,” Rawat said, adding that a committee has been formed under senior cabinet minister   to look into the issue. 

 “Stopping migration is also necessary for our state given our geographical location as a border state. We need civilian population in border villages to ensure there is no Kargil-type situation,” said Rawat.
  
  His government’s other big priority, the CM said, was corruption, which if tackled would “automatically” take the state on the path of development. “We cannot be selective in the endeavour to curb corruption. Our government is committed to constitute the  , and even the CM’s post would be under its scrutiny.”
  
  Improving the bureaucratic system, Rawat said, was also high on his wish-list. “In my meetings with officials, I came to know that one file or letter goes through seven officials at the secretariat. Now if the file remains with one official for at least three days then it would take a minimum of 21 days for clearance. So imagine the tardy progress of work and response. We want that instead of the present seven stages, a file is cleared in only three stages so that work can progress speedily.”
  
  The chief minister said that people’s expectations were high from the government, and it was a huge responsibility to live up to the expectations. “We are trying to give a transparent and accountable government. In this, we are getting full support from the Prime Minister and various central ministries. The whole country views Uttarakhand as a special place, and we have to work hard to sustain this identity.”
