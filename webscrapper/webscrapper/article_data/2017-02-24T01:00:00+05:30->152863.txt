 tells us what stepping into the shoes of one of the world’s most beautiful women is like. Excerpts:

 
 
 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is an inspiration. I’ve watched 'Robot' several times. (Laughs) I have literally followed in Aishwarya’s footsteps. But our characters aren’t related. 
 
 
 
 It’s opposite of who I am. I’ve had to change my demeanour and attitude for this part. I also have action scenes, which I love. Stunt directors were flown in from Germany and England for this film.
 
 
 Rajinikanth is a dream to work with. He’s unaffected by fame and adulation. He was nervous when hundreds of locals turned up to see him on our set in a village. He doesn’t like the spotlight, which makes him a legend.
 
 
 
 Shankar has moulded me as an actor. I shot I with him for three years. His vision has helped me grow.
 
 
 
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s work inspires me. I also like  . He writes quirky roles for actors.
