CHENNAI: Nearly 47% of people in   do not trust their spouses when it comes to   a car say results of a nationwide   by   India, a private automobile manufacturer. 

 The survey on driving habits of the Indian populace was conducted amongst 2,100 car owners spread across 20 states including Tamil Nadu. 
 
 “The most significant find was the disparity in trust exhibited by men and   with 64% of females trusting their husbands, while only 37% of the men trusted their wife’s driving skills,” said the survey report. 
 
 Couples tend to spend a longer time commuting together, and even a rare mistake committed would get registered for a longer time in their spouse’s mind. This would have made them answer the way they did, said an academic expert, who advises government on transport policy decision. “Personal likes and dislikes might also have an impact on the trust factor,” he added.
 
 Psychiatrist D Srinivasan said that not only wives, men generally do not trust women much when it comes to driving, since they perceive that their driving skills, road sense, anticipation and reflexes in case of emergencies are lower since their exposure to roads is comparatively lesser. “This will probably change in another 30-50 years,” he added. 
 
 The study also revealed that children (above 18) are least trusted with driving in the state, followed by chauffeurs at 18.5%. Referring to an incident last year where a woman was harassed by a cab driver, the academic expert said that these kind of incidents create an impact on the choice of people for driving. “Women, particularly those below 30 years of age, do not voice out their concern when chauffeurs drive in an unsafe manner,” said the expert explaining further about the fear.
