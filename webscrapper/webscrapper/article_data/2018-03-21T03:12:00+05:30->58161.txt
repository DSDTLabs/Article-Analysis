Panaji: During the past three years, the directorate of women and child development has seen its directors change at least four times. “A serious problem is that of directors constantly changing. There have been directors who have been very sensitive to children’s issues, but they barely get to know what are the issues when they are transferred The whole process has to then restart againThis doesn’t happen with other departments ,” said Nishtha Desai, founder of Children’s Rights in Goa.  Fr Maverick Fernandes, director, Caritas, said several attempts have been made to convince the tourism department to put up posters at strategic locations around the tourist state to promote the safety of children. tnn
