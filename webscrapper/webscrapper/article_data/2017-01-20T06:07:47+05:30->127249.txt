MUMBAI:   MP Supriya Sule (47) is the NCP’s face in the crucial BMC elections. A day after she was entrusted with the task of campaigning for the BMC polls, she inaugurated a record 17 election offices of NCP candidates and addressed half a dozen rallies.

 Sule’s entry in the BMC polls assumes significance in view of a vacuum in the NCP’s city unit. Former home minister R R Patil was among the star campaigners of the NCP in the last BMC elections. While R R Patil is no more, senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal is in prison since March 2016 due to his alleged involvement in the Maharashtra Sadan scam. Senior NCP leaders Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and former speaker Dilip Walse-Patil may not campaign in Mumbai as they are concentrating on western Maharashtra.
 
 NCP hopes that at juncture when most of its leaders are embroiled in controversies, Sule’s clean image and her championing the cause of women will help the party to improve its performance. NCP was the first party to declare the first list of 45 candidates and is expected to come out with its second listsoon.
 
 “In view of the complete mess in the BMC, the people of Mumbai are now looking for a change of guard and a result-oriented administration,” said Sule. “Shiv Sena has been controlling the BMC for more than two decades. In my opinion, in view of the collapse of the administration, the people want a change. In the ensuing elections, Mumbaikars will dislodge the Sena,” Sule said. Sule said that the BMC had failed on all fronts. “The quality of roads is poor, few measures have been taken to tackle the problem of solid waste and corruption has wrecked the BMC. We will convince the people to vote for NCP for providing a clean city,” she said.
