CHENNAI: Thousands pass by or enter the bustling   on Rajaji Salai in Parry’s daily, but very few notice the structure at the entrance. Fewer still know it is a  , an empty tomb, erected in memory of Lord  , the third governor general of British India, who died on October 5, 1805.

 Inside the decaying stones it holds discarded marble slabs, brooms, paint boxes and ladders, the periphery as parking space. And, almost everyone seems oblivious of its history. “I have been coming here since two years, but I don’t know what it is,” said Murthy, a cab driver who regularly parks his car opposite the cenotaph. “This is a structure the British made is all I can say,” said Siddharth, who has been working in the collectorate for the past 10 years.
 
 Marvels like this, in almost every corner of the city, despite the relentless march of time, represent a bygone era. They hold many untold stories.
 
 The Cornwallis Cenotaph, says historian Vakula Varadarajan, was built at the junction of   and the road leading to the Adyar river that from 1800 came to be known as  . It remained there till 1906. “It was moved in the year 1880 to its present location, formally known as the Bentinck building after Lord William Bentinck, governor of Madras presidency.” The old building was demolished and given a makeover, but the cenotaph was retained.
 
 After Cornwallis defeated Tipu Sultan in the third Mysore war in 1792, residents of the ‘white town’ of Madras wanted to erect a statue in his honour. The statue was made by Thomas Bank. “This cenotaph housed Cornwallis’s statue for a brief period of three years till it was finally moved to the museum,” said Varadarajan. 
 
 The name of Cornwallis remains inscribed on the cenotaph, but there is no mention of the year it was established.
