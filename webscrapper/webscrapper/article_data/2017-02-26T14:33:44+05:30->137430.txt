 Ramesh, who earlier assisted  , will be making her directorial debut with a multilingual project, Never Invite (which will be made in five languages Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and English). Talking about the film, she says, 'I have been working with RGV sir for quite sometime now. I am currently working as an assistant director for Sarkar 3, which has been   in the lead. I have been wanting to direct a film for a long time and have been writing this script. It will be a horror film based on true incidents. The film revolves around inviting spirits in real life.' 

 Nithya will have an all-new cast as she wants to give opportunity to newcomers. 'Mumbai-based model   will play the negative lead. I will be playing the female lead. My DOP Radesh PT is a well-known fashion photographer. The film is almost complete and we have begun the post production work. And for the Tamil version, we have changed a few scenes. We have kept in mind the Tamil sensibilities and have shot scenes accordingly,' says Nithya. 
 
 She also says that she's been getting a lot of offers to act. 'Apart from my own film, I haven't acted in any other feature film. I have been getting offers from Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam film industries. I am not in any hurry to do a film. I am waiting for the right script. Talks are on for trilingual film, but things are yet to be confirmed,' 
 she says.
