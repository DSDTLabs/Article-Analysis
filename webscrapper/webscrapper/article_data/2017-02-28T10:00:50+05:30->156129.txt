New Delhi: In a season in which the Delhi team has struggled to find its bearings, things seem to be unravelling very fast as far the team's composition is concerned.

 In a late night drama on Sunday ,   was asked to cancel his air ticket to Cuttack where he was supposed to fly in as a replacement of   in the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament. Medium-pacer Subodh Bhati flew out on Monday instead. 
 
 “I was given my ticket in the afternoon and then in the evening was told that I am not going. I don't know what happened,“ a dejected Narwal told TOI on Monday . Sources close to Narwal have said that the veteran all-rounder is contemplating retirement after this snub. “This is not a way to treat a senior player who has served the team so well. At the moment he is very hurt,“ the source said. Delhi selector Nikhil Chopra played down the issue saying this was just another rumour. “Few other names were also discussed. But the team management sent its wish and according to its requirement Bhati was sent,“ Chopra told TOI.
 
 It is learnt that coach   wasn't very comfortable with Narwal in the team.Like he has done throughout the season, he put his foot down on having the team combination of his choice. Post Ranji season, the selectors have dropped Parvinder Awana,   and replaced Gautam Gambhir with   as the captain of the team.
 
 “Bhaskar is very particular about the core of the team he wants. He wants things done with his vision,“ a source close to the selection panel said. Nar wal has been in and out of the Ranji team this season. However, the 34-year-old, who has played in four Ranji matches this season, added some weight to an otherwise mediocre season both with the ball and batting down the order. Delhi have lost their first two matches in the Vijay Hazare tournament.Pant will hope that his team overcomes the tension in the dressing room to qualify for the knockouts.
