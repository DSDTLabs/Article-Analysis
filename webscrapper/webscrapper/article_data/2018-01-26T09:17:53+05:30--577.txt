The Bombay Engineering Group & Centre (BEG&C) was given the responsibility of constructing FOBs at three railway stations in Mumbai. In an interview with TOI on Thursday, Brigadier  , commandant of  , spoke about the challenges, the planning and the execution of the FOBs. Excerpts. 

 
 
 
 Early in the project, we brought synergy with civil agencies and the Railways to maintain the pace of work. The   operate in border areas. We had no experience working in a crowded environment. Hence, maintaining safety and security was important.
 
 
 
 
 We studied each civil agencyâ€™s capabilities and distributed works. We could strike a balance between civil and engineering works. We ensured we had the latest equipment like pile driving machine brought from Goa, a crane of higher capacity and the maximum utilization of working hours to execute our plans.
 
 
 
 
 We devised a training module for the sappers. The platoon (a group of 30 soldiers) helped us launch the bridge in less than eight minutes at Ambivli station. The remaining two bridges will soon be launched at the other two stations. 
 
 
 
 We have learned how to work with civil agencies and utilise their resources . A professor from College of Engineering, Pune helped us in the design of the FOBs.
 
 
 
 
 We are honoured that the government assigned us this task. A tragedy took 23 lives in the   station stampede . If we construct safe bridges for people, it is the right job.
