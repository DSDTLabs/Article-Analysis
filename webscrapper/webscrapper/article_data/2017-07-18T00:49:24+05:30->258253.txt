MUMBAI: After the   issued show-cause notices to   over the latter’s health survey reports, the NGO on Monday said it had se-nt its responses. “Data mentioned in the reports has been pr-ocured from BMC itself,” the NGO said in a press release.

 “We have never treated and/or thought of our reports as adversarial to BMC,” said  . In his letter to Praja, deputy municipal commissioner (education) had said while screening for malnutrition was based on age and weight till 2013-14, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, it was based on height and weight. Praja replied that the BMC has not disputed the data’s accuracy, but merely stated that the procedure has changed. “So, 34% children in municipal schools being malnourished in 2015-16 is correct,” said the press release. Also, Praja said, the change in criteria was not mentioned in RTI responses. 
 
 Similarly, the deputy municipal commissioner (public health) had stated in his letter to Praja that it did ‘random collection of data’ from health facilities and didn’t consult programme officers to underst-and the data analysis. Praja said it had sought centralized data but was asked to ‘go to local units for information’.
