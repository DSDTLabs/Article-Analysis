HYDERABAD: On a day his followers on   touched the one-million mark, Telangana's most popular minister - tweeted in Telugu. And yes, the   flavour was apparent.

 
 KT   is the most followed politician on Twitter from Telangana. There is a mix of reasons as to why the 42-year-old IT and municipal administration minister has reached the one-million milestone.
 
 One reason is that the 'twitter king', as they call him, responds to individual problems and gets officials to solve them. In an example of this, a tweet about a seventh-class student — who dropped out of school because his father didn’t have money to pay his fees — was admitted into a Telangana minorities residential welfare institution after   was apprised of how the boy was selling tea. There are numerous instances of him responding to a calls for help in cases of medical need and civic problems and issuing instructions to officials.
 
 Of course, when he has to get back at his political rivals, he takes to Twitter, giving them him a piece of his mind.
 
 Last year, he did an over two-hour live chat on Twitter. From humour, philosophy to discussions about mundane things, he keeps followers occupied everyday. Sometimes he even pokes fun at himself.
 
 When he reached the one million mark on Friday, he tweeted a picture of him saying, "One million thanks". "Let's stay connected," he wrote. But what took everyone by surprise was when the minister, wrote in Telugu. "Ayinanu Poyi Ravale Hastinaku (Despite that, will have to go to Delhi)," KTR said. He was commenting on a report carried by TOI about the minister's visit to Delhi to seek funds for Telangana as the budget was disappointing. KTR joined twitter in March 2010.
