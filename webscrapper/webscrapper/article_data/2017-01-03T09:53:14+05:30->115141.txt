CHANDIGARH: AAP on Monday alleged deputy chief minister   was delaying in announcing his candidature from Jalalabad as trying to strike a deal with   president Captain   to secure his seat. AAP alleged that SAD wanted   Ghubaya of the Congress shifted from Jalalabad to Fazilka.

 AAP Punjab convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, in a joint statement here on Monday, claimed that Sukhbir was not feeling secure to contest from his home constituency of Jalalabad. He feared a strong backlash from Rai Sikh community which was grossly annoyed with the Badal family, they claimed. AAP has already fielded Mann from Jalalabad.
 
 The AAP leaders said Sukhbir had ‘secretly approached’ Amarinder to seek change in the constituency of Davinder Ghubaya, son of SAD’s MP Sher Singh Ghubaya. Waraich alleged that the deputy CM was not sure of a victory in the given political circumstances as AAP had thrown a challenge to the Badal family. The AAP leaders said that Sukhbir had initially tried to arm twist Ghubaya by conducting vigilance raid on his college.
 
 “Rai Sikhs, which are in majority in the Jalalabad constituency, would never vote for Badals after Sher Singh Ghubaya had announced that he would campaign for SAD,” the duo said, adding that the community felt betrayed by SAD.
 
 “If Congress commits this blunder, it would endorse the AAP stand that Capt Amarinder Singh and Sukhbir Badal are fighting assembly election in collusion with each other against AAP,” they said.
