 "As many as 40 crows have died in the town this year, till January 30. The samples we collected were sent to the Animal Disease Research Laboratory in Cuttack. Officials there sent the samples to the Bhopal institute," said  , chief district veterinary officer of Jagatsinghpur.
 
 This is the first time that bird flu has affected the district.
 
 "Avian influenza remains confined to the crow population. Chickens or other birds from the 600 samples that we sent have tested negative for the disease. We have not ordered culling yet," said Behera, adding that the port town and a 10-km radius around it were being surveyed.
 
 The virus does not travel easily to humans from crows, said the CDVO. "People are panicking as crows are often seen in human settlements. We are keeping an eye on migratory birds as well," he said. A rapid response team has been formed and is ready for action in all eight blocks of the district.
