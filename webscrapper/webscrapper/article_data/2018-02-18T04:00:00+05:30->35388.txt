Rajkot: Some miscreants set ablaze a portion of forest under revenue area where lions were often seen in Datardi village of Rajula taluka in Amreli. According to locals, there have been movement of eight to 10 lions in the area,   

 Lions are seen in different parts of Amreli like Liliya, Rajula, Jafrabad, which is a revenue area, but because of lion’s habitat, this area is known as Brihad Gir. 
 
 According to a complaint given to forest department by locals, some miscreants set ablaze the trees to scare the wildcat. There is a water tank where generally the lions come to drink water. 
 
 Wildlife activist Aatabhai Wagh, who has registered the complaint with the forest department, said, “Last week a lioness gave birth to a cub here. Miscreants know that this is lion habitat and that’s why they set it ablaze. I have complained, but no action has been taken by the forest department nor any officer visited the area.” However, forest officials said that no lion was injured in this fire. 
 
 Deputy conservator of forest T Karuppasamy said, “The area does not fall under forest, so it’s the look out of the revenue department.” However, local villagers and wildlife lovers opined that protection of lion is forest department’s responsibility.
