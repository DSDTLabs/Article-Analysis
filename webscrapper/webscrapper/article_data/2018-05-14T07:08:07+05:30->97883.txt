 spokeswoman  , who has been avisible player in the party’s affairs in recent months, on Sunday said the feud-ridden   was likely to see a new leader within a month or two. A known supporter of former TNCC chief E V K S Elangovan, Khusbhu, in an interview to TOI, said, “We need a change of leadership in Tamil Nadu.” Coming down hard on TNCC chief S Thirunavukkarasar, she said things were ‘silent’ in TNCC and there was hardly any activity in the state unit. “The TNCC chief could do much better,” she said.

 Khushbu said the state unit needed someone who could keep the party united and take it forward. “There are so many problems facing the country. But we don’t see the state unit of the party making any sound as it does in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh or  ,” she said. “The state unit is not utilising that opportunity at the moment and you need someone who can take it forward. Every problem is taken forward. You cannot rely on somebody else to do your job,” she said. On former Union finance minister P Chidambaram making a bid for the TNCC chief’s post, she said, “I doubt it.”
