CHENNAI: On Friday afternoon, just as a   walked through the corridors of  , her hands reached out to a box that had a stash of sanitary napkins the theatre encourages women to use free of cost. 

 At least three women who walked after her thought it was a promotion for the Akshay Kumar-starrer  , but theatre staff told them it wasn't. "It's only a coincidence. We have one on the ground floor as a pilot now," a staff member said. 
 
 A note on the box read: "We are here for you  . You no longer have to feel stranded." The machine will be replenished periodically, or when a woman gives a missed call to 9566000912. Theatre management said it was a long-term plan based on requests from their staff. 
 
 Women were happy with the initiative. "It has been embarrassing to run for a pad in an emergency. I am happy that we are moving out of the shadows finally," said  , a college student.
