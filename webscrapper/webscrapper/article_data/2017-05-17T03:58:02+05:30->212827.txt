He said that there would be a big logo of Nagpur, open theatre, a walking track, jogging track, cycling track, food park and public toilets in the premises. A band would play every Saturday and Sunday in the pavilion.
 
 Mudgal said that as the ground was a heritage precinct, a presentation should be made before the district collector, keeping the judgment of Nagpur bench of   in view. If the development plan was approved by the government, the misuse of Kasturchand Park would stop automatically.
