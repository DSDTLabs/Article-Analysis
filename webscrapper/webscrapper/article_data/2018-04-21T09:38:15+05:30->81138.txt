LUCKNOW: A day after three boys entered the Chandra Shekhar Azad Girls' Hostel in   campus, its jittery inmates asked university authorities to beef up security in the hostel and raise the boundary wall which the boys had scaled to enter the hostel. 

 "There is no closed circuit television camera, no proper lighting in the hostel and besides, there are several lapses in security set-up. We have written to the   seeking better security for ourselves," said an inmate. 
 
  Another girl said, "We have also written about how our previous complaints were ignored by the authorities who were waiting for a mishap to occur." 
 
 "The boys entered from the side of university dispensary where there is a wall which doesn't have any fence. It is the shortest boundary. We have been assured by university authorities that the height of the wall will be increased and all necessary measures to   will be taken," said another inmate.
 
 Chief proctor   said that all the security-related issues raised by the girls will be addressed by university. 
 
 "The student caught was suspended and barred from examination. The other two have been given two days' time to reply to the showcause notice else they will also be suspended. The matter is being investigated," said Singh.
