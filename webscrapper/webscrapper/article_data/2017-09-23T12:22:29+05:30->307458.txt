 Meanwhile, Congress workers wanted to reap political dividends from the protest and soon reached the toll plaza. Police detained 50 Congress workers from the toll plaza. District Congress president Rajendrasinh Rana said, “We demand complete waiver of toll tax on all vehicles.” 
 
 A notification issued by the toll collecting agency said cars, jeeps and other light motor vehicles will be charged Rs 20, light commercial vehicles Rs 35, buses and trucks Rs 75, commercial vehicles Rs 80 and heavy vehicles Rs 115 for single trip through the national highway. At least 40,000 vehicles pass through this national highway daily.
 
 Bharuch Citizen Council convener Kamlesh Udani said, “We had represented before Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari to waive toll tax on all local vehicles. We had also drawn his attention to the fact that there were three toll plazas in just 100 kilometre radius between Vadodara and Surat.” 
 
 NHAI officials said the cable-stayed bridge was constructed under engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode. The toll tax waiver was a decision that needed to be taken by the agency concerned. The NHAI was in no way connected with the issue.
