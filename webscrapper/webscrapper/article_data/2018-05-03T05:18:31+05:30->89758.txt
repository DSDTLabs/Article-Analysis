AHMEDABAD: Gujarat, which was India’s No.1 state in spice production till 2015-16, has slipped to No. 4, according to central government figures. The overall spice production in   was 10.78 lakh metric tonnes in 2015-16; it has slid to 8.68 lakh metric tonnes now — a drop of around 20%.

 Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh have taken the top three positions according to the preliminary estimates released by the Centre. Experts say that erratic rainfall and unfavourable weather caused a fall in productivity. Officials said that the area of sowing has remained constant at around 5 lakh hectares. In 2016-17, spice production in the state was 8.73 lakh metric tonnes. Gujarat produces ginger, chillies, turmeric, garlic, coriander, cumin, fennel, and fenugreek.
 
  
 Senior officials said that Rajasthan and others states have been able to improve productivity, which is on a declining trend in Gujarat. The officials said that in Rajasthan, the area of sowing was 10.04 lakh hectares and the production was 10.56 lakh metric tonnes in 2015-16. In 2017-18, on the same area of sowing, the production increased to 13.91 lakh metric tonnes.
 
 A former director of agriculture, Gujarat, B R Shah, said: “Conditions have not been conducive to growing spices. That may explain the fall in productivity.” Shah said that winter may not have set in during the time of flowering or the number of cold days may have been fewer over the past two seasons. “This affects production. Moreover, this year, there has been a scarcity of water. That might affect the quality too,” he said. “This year, there were unseasonal rains and the onset of winter was delayed. These factors hit spice production.”
 
 Gaurang Patel, the chairman of  , said: “I feel that production has fallen in the case of only some spices. The production of cumin has increased.” He said that last year, 57 lakh bags of cumin (each bag weighing 60kg) were produced. “This year, the number was around 85 lakh bags of 60kg,” he said.
 
 Shah said that data on the production of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and spices — among others — reveals that sowing in 2017-18 was over an area of 16.10 lakh hectares. The figure was 16.22 lakh hectares in 2016-17. The officials said that the production of various crops in 2017-18 was 234.02 lakh metric tonnes. The figure was 236.27 lakh metric tonnes in 2015-16.
 
 The data reveals that fruits were sowed over 4.11 lakh hectares and the production was 89.37 lakh metric tonnes. And vegetables were sowed over 6.44 lakh hectares and the production was 131.61 lakh metric tonnes.
