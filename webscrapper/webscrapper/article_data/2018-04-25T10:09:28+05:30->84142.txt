THRISSUR:   fervour gripped the city and its surrounding areas with full intensity as the procession carrying the replica of Neithilakkavu Devi, carried by elephant Thechikottukavu Ramachandran, emerged through the southern gate of   around noon on Tuesday. 

 The event marked the ritualistic beginning of Thrissur Pooram and the series of events associated with this 36-hour long cultural extravaganza that will formally begin with the entry of the procession from Kanimangalam Sastha temple around 6am on Wednesday. The processions from seven minor participating temples will then arrive at Vadakkunnathan temple one after the other.
 
 Madathil Varavu, the major daytime procession of   temple, will begin around 11am, while the procession from   will start around 12 noon. Ilanjithara Melam will be held inside the Vadakkunnathan temple compound after the processions reach there. 
 
 One of the interesting events ahead of Pooram was the screening of the shorter version of a documentary being made by Resul Pookutty couple of days ago. He said the documentary, scripted by local TV channel reporter Sreekesh Vellanikkara, was made with a view to give an eternal dimension to Pooram. Eminent percussionists Parakkad Thankappan, Kongad Madhu, Peruvanam Kuttan Marar and Kizhakoottu Aniyan Marar will lead the different percussion concerts at Thrissur Pooram.
 
 Meanwhile, fresh samples collected from the fireworks that will be used during the festival tested negative for banned chemical potassium chlorate.
 
 District collector A Kowsigan said that all 24 fresh samples of kuzhiminni were collected from the fireworks magazine of Thiruvambady and none of them tested positive for potassium chlorate. Of the two samples collected earlier, one had tested positive and those lots were not allowed for Monday's sample fireworks display. Some more samples of kuzhiminni fireworks, to be used by Paramekkavu side, will be tested at the laboratory at Kakkanad on Wednesday.
