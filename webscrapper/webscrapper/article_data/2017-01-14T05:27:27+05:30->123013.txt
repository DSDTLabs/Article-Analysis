MEERUT: AIMIM chief Asaduddin   on Friday sounded the poll bugle for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, asking people to vote for ‘neither bua nor babua’. “In UP polls this February, UP will neither vote for bua nor for babua; UP vote for your own party. Were we born in this world to keep voting for parties, which never stood by their promises? 70 years is a long time that we have given chance to other parties, but now it is time to vote for your own party,” said Owaisi at a rally in Shamli’s Kairana.

 Taking a jibe on SP, Owaisi, said, “Akhilesh Yadav and   keep talking about ‘vikas’ (development) but the only thing that has developed in SP rule is Yadav clan. 
 
 Speaking against BJP, Owasi, said, “When   was contesting for elections, he used to say that acche din will arrive but where are acche din? Factories have been shut down, people are dying of hunger and farmers are suffering.
