NAGPUR: Adding a touch of humour to city’s cultural scene is a two-day cartoon exhibition   which opened on Saturday at  . Organized by Cartoons Combined, an international organization, and  , Nagpur, this is the first such exhibition being held in Nagpur and Vidarbha. “We hold a seminar every year and this year, we decided to keep Nagpur as the venue as we were honouring cartoonist Manohar Sapre from Chandrapur with Lifetime Achievement award,” said Vinay Chanekar, secretary of the organization.

 The exhibition was inaugurated by Dr Abhay Bang who also presented lifetime award to Sapre. Speaking about the thought process of a cartoonist, the 85-year-old Sapre said, “A cartoonist has to observe humour from the environment and his work shows his mind set.”
 
 Some 250 works of 83 artists from all over Maharashtra are being shown at the Rangayan gallery. This include those of Manohar Sapre,  , SB Fadnavis and Vasant Sarwate. Forty of them are also attending the event. Social, political and ethnic issues have been dealt with humour and satire and are attracting the youth. “Most of the works are very recent and have been done over the past two months,” Chanekar said, pointing out to many cartoons dealing with demonetisation.
 
 A talk on the works of five international cartoonists was also delivered on the sidelines of the show by cartoonist Vivek Mehetre. Speaking about Stan and Janice Berenstein, Ted Key, Vahan Shirvanian and Ranan Lurie, Mehetre said that many of them, like Lurie, have been honoured by governments of various countries and there are museum dedicated to their work. “But in India, we do not have this custom of documenting works of a cartoonist. So it all gets lost for those wanting to do research in the sphere,” he said.
 
 On Sunday, there will be a talk by Shashikant Sapre on nuances of cartoons and its limits and Vijay Raut will speak about cartoons and animation.
