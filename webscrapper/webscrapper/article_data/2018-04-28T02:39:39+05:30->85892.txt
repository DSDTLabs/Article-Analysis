Some time ago, a military intelligence unit based in J&K and the cyber unit of Delhi police's Special Cell were alarmed by a few   accounts circulating pictures of teenagers allegedly injured by pellets in Srinagar and hailed slain   militant   as a martyr. 

 Probing the accounts, the two agencies ended up busting a Pakistan-backed hacker group. The cops and the intelligence agencies are relying these days on technology called "sentiment analysis programme" to crack down on the misuse of social networks for online propaganda and radicalisation of youths. 
 
 The programme helps cops identify provocative posts. The Special Cell antennae went up after it busted modules of   and al-Qaida in Indian Subcontinent groups. 
 
 Realising that young minds were being incited online into violence, cops began to scan the net for suspicious content. Last month, the cell put the independent cyber unit on this sensitive job.
