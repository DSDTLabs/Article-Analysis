MADURAI:   has not ridden a cycle all her life but the 37-year-old is now learning the balancing act on a moped under the watchful eyes of her driving instructor P Sundari. Meanwhile, the latter has been getting a steady stream of learners ever since the Amma two-wheeler scheme was announced.

 A mother of two working in the police department, Veeralakshmi says that the scheme had been too lucrative to not be learning to ride. ``It would help me so much in terms of commuting and also to look after my children,’’ she said. Veeralakshmi’s husband had passed away some years ago following which she was given his job.
 
 Owner of Senthoor driving school, S   said that he usually got around ten two-wheeler learners a month, but at least 30 women had turned up in the last two weeks. A learning programme for ten days costs Rs 2,000. The first three days of the course are set apart for the balancing act, where the learner is asked to ride slowly with their feet on either side of the vehicle, keeping their body straight and balancing the vehicle. ``When they balance, they are asked to accelerate slowly and move it. Some women are nervous but do it,’’ said Pandiarajan.
 
 As women want to be taught by female instructors, they find it comfortable after many lessons to take their teachers on a ride.   of Madurai said that she had decided to learn riding so that she can drop her children at school, ``Then the scheme was announced and I decided to try to get one,’’ she said. All these learners have just one wish — that the government allow them to buy the vehicle of their choice. They shouldn’t be given scooters like the government’s free laptops, grinders and televisions, all of which had a very short life span.
