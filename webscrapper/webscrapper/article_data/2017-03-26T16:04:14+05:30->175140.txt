NEW DELHI: In his 30th edition of ' ', Prime Minister   again pushed his 'New India' slogan saying that   has been "a big step" towards a new and better nation.

 His address had numerous references to 'New India', making it apparent he wanted to popularize the slogan in the country much in the manner of his 'Make in India' one.
 
 "Use digital money to serve India," Modi said, talking about his government's move to ban high-value notes, a move that has been, and continues to be criticized by many. 
 
 "New India is not a government scheme or a matter of politics," he said, even as he defended his government's demonetisation move and claimed it has already led to a huge reduction in corruption and black money. And that, of course, is a big step towards Modi's idea of a 'New India'.
  
 The PM also claimed - again contrary to what critics say - that the country has embraced demonetization and a future with increased digital transactions.
 
 "India has extended support to movement towards digital transactions. People have rejected corruption and black money," the PM said, adding that evidence of that is the "popularity" of the government's Bhim app that enables digital transactions for the common man and woman who may not have a smartphone.
 
 "In the last few months, particularly after demonetization, there has been an increase in digital payments. It has been 2-2.5 months since the Bhim app was launched and over 1.5 crore people have downloaded it," he said, without giving details of how many of those who downloaded it are actively using it.
 
 In addition to moving to digital transactions, keeping one's environs clean and being healthy, both physically and mentally, will all contribute to a new and better country, Modi said. 
 
 Earlier in his address, Modi congratulated Bangladesh on its Independence Day. He also paid rich tributes to Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, freedom fighters and martyrs.
