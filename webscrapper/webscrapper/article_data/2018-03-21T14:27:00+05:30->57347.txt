MUMBAI: On the back of the Ola-Uber protest, Mumbai’s transport services were disrupted further as job-seekers blocked trains on Central Railway for more than three hours on Tuesday. The   by   from around the country had the backing of Raj Thackeray’s  .

 Agitators who began   around 6.30am, soon brought traffic to a halt. As their numbers swelled, the situation briefly turned violent with stone-throwing on security personnel. The stir was finally called off around 10.30am following an assurance from CR’s chief personnel officer that their demands would be taken up by the railway board.
 
 By then 68 suburban services had been cancelled, leaving lakhs of commuters stranded. Office attendance recorded a drop in the morning hours and college exams too were postponed. Kalyan resident Mahesh Borade said, “My train was stuck at Sion for one hour. I walked to Matunga and then took a Churchgate train.”
 
 The whiplash on social media underlined the contrast between the responsible manner in which marginal farmers had organized a rally in the city and the disorderliness of the youths. The lack of police intelligence on the protest, which was organized through WhatsApp, and the inability of agencies to take pre-emptive action too came in for criticism.
