MARGAO: Curtorim MLA Aleixo   on Monday criticized union minister for civil aviation  , for the latter’s recent pitch to make the upcoming greenfield airport at Mopa a “cargo hub of India”. 

 On his visit to Mopa on Saturday to inspect ongoing work, Prabhu has said that Mopa airport would be developed to handle air cargo at a larger scale. 
 
 “Goa’s major export is iron ore and its major import is coal. These are low volume dirty cargo that can be imported/exported only by ships. Is this what Suresh Prabhu aims to export or import from/to the state by air?” Lourenco said.
 
 Pointing out that neither are any of the export oriented goods manufactured in and around the state nor are the consuming centres for major Indian imports near Goa, Lourenco accused Prabhu of “fooling the people”.
