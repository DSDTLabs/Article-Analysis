NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday clarified there was "no change" in its position that all military personnel who opted for premature retirement (PMR) before the November 2015 notification for one rank, one pension ( ) will continue to get its benefits, while the ones who do so after that deadline will not. 

 The MoD's move to rectify "some typographical errors" in its OROP notification has caused some alarm in military circles that the government was withdrawing OROP for personnel who had opted for PMR before November 2015.
 
  "There is no change...the original order stands. As for representations that military personnel who opt for PMR after November 2015 should also be considered for OROP, the issue is under examination," said an official. 
 
  As earlier reported by TOI, the government is examining whether it should slightly relax the norms for denial of OROP benefits to fresh PMR cases. One proposal is that OROP should be granted to "superseded" officers who take PMR after continuing in service for four additional years. 
 
 Similarly, jawans and junior commissioned officers who serve for three additional years after they get superseded should also get OROP.
