CHANDIGARH: The mayor and two BJP councilors are out of the woods as the Chandigarh district court has accepted the police cancellation report in a case of alleged violation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act and   

 Chandigarh mayor Asha Jaswal and two BJP councilors, Rajesh Kalia and Ravi Kant Sharma, were booked for trespassing into Snehalaya, a home for the destitute, and meeting a victim of child sexual abuse and violating the provisions of the two acts. As per the laws, visitors need permission and cannot meet a victim without a child welfare officer being present. UT director of social welfare department   filed the complaint. 
 
 The court of additional district and   Ashwani Kumar accepted the cancellation report submitted by the police after Singhal said she had no objections. Singhal said she was not an eyewitness but had filed the complaint based on information from her staff.
 
 The police had filed the cancellation report at the end of March but the court did not accept it. The cancellation report was filed by Chandigarh police in court of Imanbir Singh Dhaliwal, judicial magistrate (first class), and the court accepted the report relating to offences under seven sections of the IPC. The court, however, did not have jurisdiction to deal with offences under the POCSO and   acts.
 
 The UT police then filed a fresh application in the court of the additional district and session judge. The court on Friday accepted the cancellation report completely.
 
 On January 31, police registered a complaint of one child molesting another at the home, and early in February the mayor and two councillors visited the home and met the staff and victim. The same day, the social welfare department director lodged a complaint with the police saying that the three entered the premises without permission and that their meeting a sexual assault victim without a child welfare officer violated the Juvenile Justice Act.
