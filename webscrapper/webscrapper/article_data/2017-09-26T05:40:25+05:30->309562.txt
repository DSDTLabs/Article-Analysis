NEW DELHI:   on Monday said it has moved the Delhi high court for enforcement of the ruling in its favour by the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) against its estranged joint-venture (JV) partner in India  .

 LCIA had ruled in McDonald’s favour earlier this month and had asked Bakshi, the MD of Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), to sell his 50% stake in the company at a fair valuation in accordance with their JV agreement. While Bakshi said he had no knowledge of McDonald’s moving the Delhi HC, McDonald’s in an email confirmed the development and said, “At the same time,   (MIPL) will continue with its appeal at the   and also continue to take all other measures and steps to exercise our legal and contractual rights in related matters.”
 
 McDonald’s had dragged Bakshi to the LCIA in 2013 after the businessman had moved the Company Law Board (CLB) seeking his reinstatement as CPRL’s MD. Earlier this year, McDonald’s had removed Bakshi as the JV company’s MD, alleging his involvement in financial mismanagement at CPRL.
 
 In 2016, the Delhi HC had allowed McDonald’s to pursue arbitration at LCIA, while in July this year the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) reinstated Bakshi as CPRL’s MD. Subsequently, McDonald’s served a notice to CPRL terminating its franchise agreement, which means CPRL cannot use the McDonald’s trademarks and recipes.
