MANGALURU: Six months after the ouster of 10   artistes and helpers from one of the popular Melas, the   has stepped up pressure demanding that the   management reinstate the artistes.

 The Samithi will submit a memorandum to the government through district deputy commissioner Sasikanth Senthil S on Saturday. A couple of days ago, Biruver Kudla, which is involved in social service, too, had demanded the sacked artistes of the   Sri Durgaparameshwari Prasadita Dashavatara Yakshagana Mandali, Kateel, and helpers be taken back, threatening to intensify protests otherwise.
 
 “The Samithi condemns the unceremoious sacking of the artistes who have been associated with the Kateel Mela for at least a decade to three decades. We demand the management reabsorb them into any of the six Melas at least for the next season,” said P Keshava, member of the Samithi.
 
 A typical Yakshagana season begins in November and ends by May. In November, around 30 artistes and helpers of the fifth Mela of Kateel had objected to the transfer of their bhagawat, considered the life of a Mela, to another Mela. Taking offence, the boss of the six Melas sacked all 30 and later reinstated 20 of them.
 
 The rebels have been alleging that the 10 ousted people have been chosen on the basis of their caste and that the management hasn’t even accepted their apology letter. The artistes maintain that the tone and tenor of their demand to retain their Bhagawat may have been inappropriate.
