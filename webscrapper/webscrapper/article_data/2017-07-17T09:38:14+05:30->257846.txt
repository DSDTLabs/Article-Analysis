  The 'Saraswatichandra' actress might have had a conventional start, but over the years, she has experimented with her characters in both films and TV. She continues to surprise her fans with not just her different choice of roles but also her fashionable and sexy avatar.
  
  The actress, who plays the role of a fierce wife on Beyhadh, is currently seen sporting a bald look for the current track of the show. Fans have been really excited to watch her on screen after her character got killed.
