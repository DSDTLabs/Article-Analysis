MUMBAI: Over 300 activists belonging to around 40 organizations gathered at   on Thursday to protest Israeli   Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit. 

 “We have sympathy for Moshe, the boy who survived the horrible 9/11 attack at Chabad House, but what about the merciless killings of so many Palestenian children under Netanyahu’s watch?” said Feroze Mithiborewala of India Palestine Solidarity Forum, which led the morcha.
 
  Activist M A Khalid said the presence of non-Muslims at the protest showed that the visit is being opposed by all peace-loving Indians and not just Muslims. Several communist activists participated. “We will not allow a chowk at Kala Ghoda to be named after former Israeli PM Shimon Peres. This will be insult to our freedom fighters,” said CPI leader Prakash Reddy.
