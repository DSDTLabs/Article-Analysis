CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal   on Saturday attacked his predecessor Bhupinder Singh Hooda and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying that wrongdoings of the Congress made people turn towards the BJP, which had been able to bring unprecedented reforms in the state.

 Hoping for unravelling of more scams during Hooda’s time, Khattar said the Supreme Court had given two months to the Punjab and Haryana high court to make public the report of Justice Dhingra commission and that period would be over in 10 days. “Thereafter, the court would take a decision and make the report public,” said the CM on the sidelines of an event in Chandigarh on Saturday.
 
 “Media, people and the present state government had highlighted the wrongdoings of Hooda and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra, which made the voters turn against the party and gave BJP the mandate to form the government in Haryana,” he maintained. Khattar said various scams pertaining to the Congress tenure in Haryana and at the Centre had been unearthed. The then PM and former CM were also accused of corruption, said Khattar. Some scams committed during the Congress regime are now coming to light through the Supreme Court and the high court, he added.
