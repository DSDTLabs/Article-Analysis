PATNA: The   Teachers’ Association (MUTA) president A K Singh Thakur on Saturday took exception to the FIR lodged by Patna district education officer (DEO) Jyoti Kumar against 114 college teachers for their ‘failure’ to join evaluation duty at the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB)’s +2 answer book evaluation centres.

 Thakur appealed to governor-cum-chancellor Satya Pal Mallik, CM Nitish Kumar and education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Varma to look into the matter sympathetically and create a cordial atmosphere by withdrawing the FIR.
 
 B D College teachers also held a meeting in this connection on their campus on Saturday and urged the BSEB chairman to withdraw the FIR because most of the teachers could not join intermediate evaluation duty as they were engaged in the Degree part I examination answer book evaluation and Magadh University Students’ Union polls from March 7 to 17. 
 
 Many teachers claimed they did not get any BSEB letter appointing them as examiners. They said the DEO should have first checked his records whether the appointment letters were actually served to them or not.
 
 Laxmi Prasad said she retired from J D Women’s College long back, but has been made an accused in the FIR. Ranju Singh of the same college said she never received the appointment letter as head examiner in English. Jayshree Dhar of R P M College-Patna City said she retired in 2014, but has been made an accused in the FIR.
 
 Prof R K Sinha of R L S Y College-Bakhtiarpur and Prof Waheed of R P M College-Patna City said they were being victimised for no fault of theirs. “Unless we are served with appointment letters, the BSEB or the DEO has no right to frame us as an accused in the FIR,” Prof Sinha said.
