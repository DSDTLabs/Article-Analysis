The carcass of a male leopard was found on the   near   early on Saturday. Forest department officials said that the leopard appeared to have been run over by a speeding vehicle. 

 Deputy conservator of forests (territorial),  , said, "The leopard should be aged around six or seven. It seemed to have been run over and died late on Friday night very close to the Talegaon toll plaza," he said.
 
 The official said that the animal was possibly injured before being run over, as one of its legs seemed to have been fractured. "This could have slowed the leopard's responses, making it difficult for it to avoid the hit from the vehicle," he said. The driver of the vehicle involved in the accident did not inform the authorities and is still to be identified. A note of the incident has been made at   police station.
 
 Gujar told TOI that the leopard was from the forest area around Mulshi. "There are a few leopards there, and some that were discovered to be moving around in this area very recently," he said. He added that such incidents highlight the department's appeal for building overpass or corridor for the animals to cross the road. -Abhishek Samuel
