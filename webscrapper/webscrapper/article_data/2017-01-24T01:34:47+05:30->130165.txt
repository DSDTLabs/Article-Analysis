MUMBAI: The state excise department, in collaboration with home department, has announced a slew of schemes under ‘track and trace mechanism’ to check adulteration of liquor. Under this scheme, many initiatives like installing CCTV’s on the vehicle carrying liquor from the distilleries, having a unique hologram for all bottles, geo-fencing of the tanker carrying the liquor etc will be taken up. 

 A software will be created in which all these initiatives will be integrated. One authority can see the data by all these schemes and loopholes in the system can be tightened.
