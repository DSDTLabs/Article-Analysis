NAGPUR: Even as work on three flyovers in the city is in various stages, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to build two more within municipal limits. The first one will connect Ashok Square (on Great Nag Road) with Agrasen Square (on Central Avenue) while the second will be from Indora Square (on Kamptee Road) to Pachpaoli Square.

 NHAI regional officer M Chandrashekhar told TOI the length of the first flyover was 1 km and it will cost Rs213 crore. “The second one is 1.5 km long and will cost Rs243 crore. Work on both projects will start in six months,” he said.
 
 Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari wants NHAI to build another two flyovers. The first is from   to Satranjipura. It will be 5 km long and will cost about Rs300 crore. The second will connect   to  . Its length will be 2 km and cost about Rs 200 crore.
 
 NHAI regional office is against these structures because   flyover passes through busy market area and too many shops will have to be demolished for it. A lot of people will have to be displaced for constructing the second one too. The final decision in this regard will be taken by the NHAI head office.
 
 Commenting on the three already sanctioned flyovers, Chandrashekhar said there was a delay in starting work on 7 km long Pardi flyover due to land acquisition problems. “There is a lot of encroachment on the land needed plus some religious structures will have to be relocated. It will take another two and half years to build,” he added.
 
 The soil testing for   square flyover has started and it will take three years to complete. Survey for new Khapri railway overbridge (ROB) has also started and it would be completed in one and half years.
