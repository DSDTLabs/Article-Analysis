NEW DELHI: Cricketer-turned politician and   tourism minister  's bank accounts have been frozen by the income tax department after he lost an appeal related to his tax assessment. 

 
 A top source in the   confirmed that the bank accounts were frozen but refused to divulge the amount of tax due from Sidhu. The official, however, said after Sidhu the former cricketer failed to provide documentary evidence to substantiate his income and refused to pay tax dues, the department attached his bank accounts.
 
 A n agency report earlier said Sidhu's tax dues amounted to Rs 52 lakh. He had declared certain expenditure towards dress expenses, tour and travelling that were not substantiated through actual bills, and for which his income was reassessed and a fresh demand was raised. 
 
 The tax authorities had disallowed at least 30% of the expenditure he had declared in his income returns, according to reports. Sidhu appealed against the order in January last year but the commissioner of income tax appeals passed an order favouring the I-T department's claims. TNN
