VISAKHAPATNAM: The city’s denizens have begun   it out with hot and sultry days making a comeback after months of pleasant weather. Humid weather has set in a couple of weeks before summer is expected to begin from March 1, according to officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).

The humidity levels are at par with the average levels in summer, which is around 75% and 68% respectively.
