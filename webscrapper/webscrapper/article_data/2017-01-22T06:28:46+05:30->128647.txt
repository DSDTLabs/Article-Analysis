BENGALURU: Wondering why the   while the days are warm? The phenomenon can be attributed to the prolonged dry spell, says the weatherman, and is likely to continue till mid-February. 

 According to the  , the minimum temperature has seen a depreciation of 1 degree Celsius from the average in Bengaluru, Chintamani, Gadag and Panambur and 5 degrees Celsius in Hassan and Vijayapura. 
 
 “The first half of January is when the minimum or night temperature is at its lowest. But this time, nights continue to be cold due to the dry weather conditions. Sometimes, spells of wind blowing from the Bay of Bengal also bring down night temperatures,” said Dr MB Rajegowda, registrar,   (UAS).
 
 Rajegowda, who is also professor and head of the all-India co-ordinated   at UAS, said that both day and night temperatures will see a gradual increase from the second week of February. “Due to the extended dry spell, we could also witness the onset of summer by March second week. It usually gets hot only in the first week of April. Even pre-monsoon showers are expected to arrive early, by March third week,” he explained.
 
 The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) has predicted that the dry weather conditions will continue for a few more weeks. KSNDMC recorded the lowest minimum temperature for the district (9.9 degrees Celsius) in Bankal hobli, Chikkamagaluru district.
