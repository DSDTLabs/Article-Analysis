MUMBAI: The minimum   for your   and   ride could be regulated by the state government to create a ‘level-playing’ field between aggregator cabs and black-and-yellow taxis. This may be part of the report brought out by the state-appointed   by the month-end. 

 “If you want to create a level-playing field with  , you have to first improve their quality of service and efficiency,” said a Khatua panel member. He added that the state should issue more   for black-and-yellow taxis, encourage drivers to use AC, and provide round-the-clock services like aggregator cabs. 
 
 Commuters are, however, against any change in the minimum competitive fare—it is as low as Rs 6-Rs 8 per km for aggregator cabs. Dinesh Singh, who regularly plies by Ola, said the low-end fare and discounts should not be disturbed as it ensures economical rides for commuters.
 
 By July 31, the Khatua panel will come out with single report suggesting new fares for autorickshaws, taxis and fleetcabs and recommending minimum and maximum fares (a cap on surge price) for aggregator cabs. A central-level committee had recently suggested that the surge price could be a maximum three times the minimum fare. The Khatua panel is lloking into this aspect.
 
 The panel is also likely to make taxi and auto fare hikes ‘conditional’ with emphasis on improving quality and efficiency of services before any hike is announced. This mean, said sources, commuters could have a say in ‘rejection’ of fare hikes by drivers and also suggest that fare revision should be done once in three years. This will be based on rider ratings that will be applicable to all drivers, be it kaali-peeli or fleetcab. The ratings will be based on factors like fare refusals and use of e-meters.
