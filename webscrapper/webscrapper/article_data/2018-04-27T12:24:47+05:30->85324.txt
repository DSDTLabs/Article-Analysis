AHMEDABAD: Police usually first have someone complain about an offence and then begin a search for the accused. On February 11, when Amreli police illegally confined Surat-based realtor Shailesh Bhatt, his driver   and business partner   from near Koba circle in   district, they set in motion a series of events that led to the arrests of Amreli SP   and LCB inspector Anant Patel, two other cops and a Surat-based lawyer.

  “In this case, both the SP and the inspector first caught the ‘accused’, Bhatt. When they realized Bhatt was approaching other agencies including the CID, they tried to find a victim and complainant,” said a CID official associated with the case. These details emerged from interrogation of the accused in the bitcoin extortion case. Officials said that while the bitcoin and cash extortion have not been proved yet, the biggest charge the cops face is abduction and illegal confinement. “It did not make sense that a team from Amreli would catch a person from Surat in Gandhinagar. The team tried to forge an application of complaint later, but it too feeble to justify a team of 10 policemen and three vehicles being dispatched 260km from Amreli, to Gandhinagar,” said the official.
 
 According the investigation, both Jagdish Patel and Anant Patel tried to find someone who could lodge a complaint against Bhatt, ever since he approached CID with his application. Their effort to find such a person in Surat and Amreli was not fruitful.
 
 “Evidences has so far clarified the roles of most of the persons involved. We are piecing together the entire narrative for January and February for each of accused and their connections with the co-accused persons,” said the official.
