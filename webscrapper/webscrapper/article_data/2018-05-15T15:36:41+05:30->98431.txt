PATNA: Patna grappled with power outages for hours following thunderstorm accompanied by squall on Sunday night. Officials attributed the outages to the damages caused to the conductors of overhead power cables by high-velocity winds.

 According to   ( ) GM Dilip Kumar Singh, tree branches and banners usually come in contact with adjacent overhead electricity cables and conductors due to high-speed winds, causing temporary and permanent damages. As soon as the thunderstorm and squall end, trials are taken to investigate about the faults in lines across the region, due to which power supply flickers for multiple times.
 
 Fault passage investigators (FPIs) installed in the conductors detect the fault in passage. “As soon as the power is supplied, the FPIs get to know about the area of breakdown where restoration work is carried out,” Singh said.
 
 While temporary faults are resolved within half an hour or so, permanent faults are rectified in two hours. “Also, extreme weather conditions pose various risks such as power surges due to which supply is cut for that duration,” Singh said.
 
 Residents, however, complained of hardship. “Our dependence on electricity generators increases due to power cuts,” Boring Road resident   said. 
 
 Student   said frequent power supply cuts could damage electrical appliances at home like TV, refrigerator and computers, and increase the chances of short circuits.
 
 Pesu officials, on the other hand, pointed out unscheduled power cuts have come down drastically. “Power outages happen only when there is a certain external jerk on poles of overhead wires (usually through vehicles) or during summers when the demand of electricity shoots up, leading to feeder tripping,” the   said and added unscheduled power cuts had otherwise reduced to minimum in the city.
