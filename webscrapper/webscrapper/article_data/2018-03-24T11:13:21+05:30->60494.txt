MYSURU: Extending their support to social activist Anna Hazare’s indefinite fast, various pro-farmer organizations staged a   near the Mysuru Law Courts on Friday.

 We are with Anna   who is pushing for the implementation of the Lokpal bill and appointment of   in all states in the country, said the protestors.
 
 Urging the government to implement the Swaminathan Report and waive farm loans, the protestors said, “The government should provide minimum support price (MSP) to farmers. The central government which has taken an anti-farmer stance should change its attitude towards   by intervening in the Mahadayi water sharing dispute.”
