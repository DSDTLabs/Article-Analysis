CHANDIGARH: Haryana government is considering a proposal to make two year service in the state hospitals compulsary for students completing their MBBS from Haryana. Stating this in reply to a question raised by   from Tosham, Kiran Choudhry during the ongoing budget session of Haryana assembly on Thursday, health minister Anil Vij said the proposal was being legally examined and if implemented, there would be no shortage of doctors in the state.

He said with a view to meet the demands of doctors, an advertisement has been released for recruitment of 662 doctors. Around 1,800 applications have been received and the selection process would soon begin. During last year also, the doctors were recruited to provide quality healthcare facilities to the people.
 
 He said the department has decided to make online transfers of doctors next month to meet the requirement in state hospitals. Vij said that during the tenure of the present state government, the health sector has undergone a significant improvement and the number of patients to the OPDs in the government hospitals have increased by 19.17%.
