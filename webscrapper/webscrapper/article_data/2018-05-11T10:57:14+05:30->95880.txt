HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Thursday paved way for the commencement of construction of double bedroom houses in   area in   of Asifnagar mandal. The vacation bench comprising Justice U Durga Prasad Rao and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili accorded the permission by modifying a restraint order over the scheme launch. However, the bench wanted the state to conduct a survey pertaining to the two land parcels that have become a bone of contention in the tussle. 

 The bench was hearing a writ appeal filed by the state government. Earlier a single judge stayed the construction on the grounds that the state had not demarcated the land. The single judge stayed the process while hearing a petition filed by one of the allottes of Mustafa Hills Housing Society alleging that the government was planning to start construction by encroaching society land. The judge directed the state to conduct a survey in respect of Mustafa society's 6 acre land and 13 acre land of the state and stayed the construction till then. 
 
 Telangana Additional Advocate General J Ramchander Rao on Thursday told the vacation bench that the state is building these houses for the weaker sections and intended to speed it during summer. He stated that the 6 acres land allotted to the society has already been demarcated and the 13 acres of government in which the construction of double bedroom houses is taking place will also be demarcated as directed. He gave an undertaking that the 2BHK construction will remain within the state's land. 
 
 The bench recorded this undertaking and permitted the government to go ahead with the construction. It however said constructions too will be subject to the outcome of the writ petition that is pending before the single judge.
