On the eve of  , Mehfil, a poetry confluence with performances of poets from Jaipur and Kota was organised at a city café.

 The evening had performances from city poets Umang Maheshwari, Rishi Dixit, Bhavya Soni, Surya Prakash Upadhyay and Arvind Kumawat who entertained the audience with their beautiful words. 
 
 Some of the lines from Umang’s poem read, ‘Likh, ki kalam azad hai teri. Likh, ki badle soorat ae hal. Likh, ki tujhe karana hai bawaal. Likh, ki abhi baaki hai sawaal. Likh kahaani teri, likh kahaani meri. Likh ki kalam azaad hai teri.’
