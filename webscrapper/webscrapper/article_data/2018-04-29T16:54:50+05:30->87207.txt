  to 
  and now — she is impressing everyone with her performance in 
  on Colors in the interesting role of Anushka and Juhi. According to her, this role is one of the boldest choices she has made as an actor. 

 Avika, who is a Gujarati and has many relatives residing in Ahmedabad keeps visiting the city very often. She has done a Telugu movie as well. So we as her if she were offered a Gujarati film, will she consider taking it up? To this, Avika shares, "I am extremely proud of my lineage. I am getting a lot of offers for Gujarati movies and I’d love to do a Gujarati film if the project’s good." 
  
  
 Avika has an inclination for Gujarati theatre too. She shares, "Gujarati theatre too impresses me a lot. It is the reflection of how strong our literature is and the kind of concepts the theatre-professionals come up with leave me awestruck!"
 We hope to see you making your debut in D-Town, Avika! Good luck!
