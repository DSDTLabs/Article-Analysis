MUMBAI: A junior   engineer was knocked down by a speeding local while on   between Jogeshwari and Ram Mandir Road stations early on Thursday.

 The incident once again brought into focus the need for safety of those working on   late at night. Last year, an   died after being run over by a goods train near Kopar station, while more than a dozen   have died on duty in the past three years.
 
 In the latest case, Mahendra Kharat (53) was preparing for the late night block to maintain overhead electrical equipment. “He was part of a team assigned electrification of an OHE pole close to the tracks. Unfortunately, while supervising the operations, he was knocked down by a speeding Borivli-bound local on the Down through (fast) line. He was sent to Shatabdi hospital but was declared dead,” an official said.
 
 The official said Kharat, attached to the construction department, had more than two decades of experience. A resident of Dahisar railway quarters, he is survived by wife, two daughters and a son. “Colleagues attended his funeral on Thursday evening. The incident has shocked us. We demand greater safety for officials working on late night rail blocks,” said a staffer.
 
 Another official said, “It is very difficult to carry out operations near tracks at night. Sometimes, headlights of oncoming trains are so bright, you are not sure if you are standing on a live track or between two tracks.”
 
 A railway engineer was run over by a goods train near Kopar station in October 2016. Labour unions had blamed “unsafe working conditions” for the incident. He met with the accident while inspecting digital axle counters between Dombivli and Kopar stations, an official said.
 
 Earlier, a gangman was run over by a suburban train at Tilak Nagar station and four gangmen were killed after a speeding CST-bound local ran over them while they were walking along tracks on the Central Railway line near Kurla, an official added.
