MEERUT: Following the   order banning sale of liquor within 500 m of national and state highways from April 1, as many as 193 liquor vends, hotels and shops will have to down shutters in Meerut district. While the excise department has already sealed 99 such vends, an inquiry on others is underway. The department is expected lose Rs 180 crore annual revenue following the ban, claim officials.
 
   , district excise officer, said, “There are a total of 193 places serving liquor on national and state highways and are against the Supreme Court order. We have already sealed as many as 99 such places serving liquor. The remaining shops were found shut, and we are searching for the owners of these establishments so that we can seal these soon. Action will be taken according to the rules.”
  
  The order banning liquor sale within 500 m of national highways and state highways across the country has also been extended to pubs, bars and hotels, and most states are left staring at big revenue losses because of this. “According to our estimates, we will lose nearly Rs 180 crore revenue. However, terming it as a ‘loss’ would be wrong because we have to comply with the orders of the Supreme Court,” said Dubey.
  
  Meerut district has a total of three national highways and four state highways. Now, nearly 50% of the liquor selling places, including vends, pubs, hotels, will be affected. Of the total 397 liquor selling shops, 193 will have to shift – making 48% of the total liquor serving places redundant.
  
  As a quick fix, the BJP-led state government started work on a plan to denotify state highways in major cities to circumvent the apex court ruling. So far, four states — Rajasthan,  , Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh — have already denotified state highways. As a result, they will not be required to wind up liquor shops, permit rooms and bars.
