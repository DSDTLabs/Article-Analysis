CHENNAI: A day after   announced the first special   from   -- Chennai’s third coaching terminal -- to  , the train has been cancelled. 

 Reservation for the train on the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website was suspended on Tuesday afternoon.
 
 Train number 06069 Tambaram – Sengottai special fare train was to run from September 15 to 30 five days a week except on Sundays and Tuesdays, starting at 5am and reaching Sengottai at 8:05pm. 
 
 In the return direction, it was to run on all days except on Mondays and Wednesdays, starting at 6:15am and reaching Tambaram at 10:30pm. It was to run on the longer main south broad gauge line on the Villupuram-Thanjavur-Tiruchirapalli section.
 
 A senior official said an engineering work has cropped up on the Thanjavur-Tiruchirapalli section because of which the train had to be “temporarily suspended.” The work is the doubling of the section, another source said. 
 
 “We will try to run the train on some other route,” the senior official said.
 
 Another official said that a proposal to run the train on the shorter chord line (through Vridhachalam) has been given.
 
 Passengers are not happy about the cancellation, as a day train to the southern districts has been announced after a long time. 
 
 “This shows the complete lack of coordination among railway departments. It is an inauspicious start for Tambaram terminal,” said A Giri, vice-president of Thanjavur District Rail Users Association (TANDRUA).
 
 Aseervatham Achary, member of the Passenger Amenities Committee (PAC) set up by the central government, said he was working hard to ensure that the train is run on both routes.
