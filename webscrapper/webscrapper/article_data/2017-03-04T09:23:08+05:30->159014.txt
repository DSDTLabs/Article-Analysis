 Saini found several chats misusing her name by the boy , in one of which he wrote, “There are many unmarried PPSPCS officers in Lucknow and if you wish, I will talk on your behalf about your marriage“, the boy had written to an unmarried woman on the friend list, an PCS (provincial civil services) based in Meerut.
 
 In a goof-up, the boy had ordered arrest of a businessman who had wanted to come to Lucknow, telling him, “If you are seen in Lucknow I will initiate a criminal case and order Lucknow crime branch to arrest you.“ The parents of the boy came to Lucknow when he was brought to Lucknow and detained. His mother said he had secured 90% marks in Class X and was inspired by Manzil Saini to become an IPS.
