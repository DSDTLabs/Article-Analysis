 who had earlier crooned chart-toppers like ' ' for 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania', 'Highway's 'Sooha Saha', 'Ik Kudi' for 'Udta Punjab' and the club remix of 'Dear Zindagi's title track, had surprised everyone by not getting into the recording studio for her upcoming romcom, ' '. Her disappointed fans started a hashtag #WewantHumsafarbyAlia to urge the 23-year-old actress to sing the female version of  's 'Humsafar'. Their wishes have been fulfilled. Alia recently recorded 'Humsafar' and is even shooting a special video with co-star 
 .

  
  
 A source close to the development says, "Alia and Varun were initially scheduled to shoot the video for the promotional number on Monday in Mumbai. The shoot is now happening today. It will be aired on music channels after the film's release."
 
 Alia recently admitted to Mirror that she would love to sing in her upcoming films,  's superhero fantasy adventure, 'Dragon', featuring 
 , and  's musical 'Gully Boys' with 
  too. "I enjoy singing although right now my schedule is crazy. It's so hectic that I don't even get to sleep at night. The idea is to reach out to everyone across the country, down to the remotest corner. 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' is a film that you can't box down to one particular audience, it's a universal entertainer," she asserts.
 
 After the film's release, the actress will take a couple of months break during which she will not only travel to Los Angeles for a vacation and take cooking lessons but she will also learn to play the piano. Who knows, maybe the next time we hear her sing , she'll play the keys too.
