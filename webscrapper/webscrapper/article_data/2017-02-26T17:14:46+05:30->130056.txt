Vineeth plays Alby who hails from the Muvattupuzha - Kothamangalam area of Kerala. He belongs to a conservative family household. His father, played by Renji Panicker, is a Jacobite priest and he also wishes Alby to embrace the same path.' The movie is also scripted by Leo himself.
 
 Alby, on the other hand, has a few other plans in his mind. Leo says, 'He gets introduced to a group of filmmaking enthusiasts in Kochi and Alby feels that's what he wants to do. He becomes an associate director and pursues the dream of being a filmmaker.'
