Producer   is optimistic about the success of his next film   — a romantic drama featuring   and   in lead roles. Vaisakham is being produced by BA Raju under RJ Cinemas. “We started shooting for the movie with a song sequence at the   temple in  . It is a Shiva temple and there are many Shiva lingams installed in it. The whole cast and crew had a great time filming the mass song   over four days. But what’s remarkable is that we ended the shooting on Shivratri. So it started and ended with Lord Shiva’s blessings, and that’s a very auspicious thing for us. I’m sure the film will be a success,” enthuses Raju, whose wife, B Jaya is directing the film.
