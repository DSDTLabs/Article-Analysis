Veteran   actor   was admitted to   in Mumbai's Girgaum after suffering from severe dehydration. However, this recent picture that has started doing the rounds on social media tells a different story.

 Despite his son releasing a statement of him being in a recovery mode, Vinod Khanna looks terribly weak and pale in the above picture. The actor seems to have lost a huge amount of weight and rumours are rife that he might be suffering from cancer.
 
 Neither the family members nor the hospital staff is revealing anything about the deteriorating condition of the evergreen actor. However, a report on Firstpost said that the hospital authorities have refuted to comment on whether or not the actor suffers from cancer. 
 
 Fans have constantly been posting their good health wishes on Twitter.
 
 We hope that Mr Vinod Khanna recovers soon.
