MUMBAI: With the   downsizing its budget to Rs 25,141crore this year, the additional   allocated to corporators and political parties has also been cut.

 On Friday, the civic budget was passed by the   and it would now be tabled before the civic house for final approval. An amendment of Rs 350 crore to the Rs 25,141crore budget, presented by the municipal commissioner in March this year, has been made by the committee. This money is allocated among corporators and parties for local area development. 
 
 Last year, Rs 400 crore was amendment, out of which, officials said, only around Rs 300 crore was spent. All corporators would get Rs 1 crore each as development fund out of this Rs 350 crore, and the rest distributed to parties. Political group leaders decide how much fund is allocated to whom.
 
  There is still no clarity whether, like last year, Rs 50 crore would be allocated to the Mayor this year again.
 
 With Sena having the maximum number of corporators in the house, the party is likely to get a bigger share out the remaining funds after Rs 1 crore is allocated to each of the 227 elected corporators and five nominated corporators.
 
 However with this amendment, the BMC would be required to take out funds from allocations made to various departments. A senior civic official said that mostly the funds would be taken from allocations made for land acquisition, roads, storm water drains, development fund and periphery works.
 
 The civic standing committee chairperson   confirmed that an amendment of Rs 350 crore has been made to the budget.
