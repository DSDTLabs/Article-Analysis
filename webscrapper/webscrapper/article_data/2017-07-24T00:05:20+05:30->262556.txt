It is the duty of the government to suspend any project that is against the interest of the people, said DMDK leader Vijayakanth at Neduvasal on Sunday. 

 Expressing solidarity with the villagers, who have been protesting against ONGC’s exploratory works at Neduvasal for the past 103 days, Vijayakanth said that “he would do whatever is possible to ensure that the project is not taken up at Neduvasal.” 
 
 He called for the removal of Oil and Natural Gas Commission ( ) from Neduvasal and alleged that it was during both DMK and AIADMK regimes such projects were sanctioned in the state. 
 
 Speaking to the media after visiting the bore wells,Vijayakanth said if he got an opportunity to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he would urge him to suspend the project. 
 
 Asked on the possible entry of actor Rajnikanth and Kamal Hassan into politics, he said that it was “their personal decision” and that he was not fearful of more actors entering politics. 
 
 He said there is nothing wrong in learning Hindi and rejected the claims that the Union government is imposing Hindi on non-Hindi speaking population.
 
 The DMDK leader sought judicial inquiry into the alleged special treatment being provided to AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala in the Bengaluru prison. He also sought disqualification of DMK leader M Karunanidhi from Tamil Nadu assembly “as he has not attended the assembly in the past 6 months”, while criticizing the unprecedented exception given to the leader.
