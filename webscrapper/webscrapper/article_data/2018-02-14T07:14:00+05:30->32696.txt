GURUGRAM: Temporary lecturers in   city have demanded job security from the government, alleging that it was ramping up new recruitment while pushing them out either through deputation or transfers.

Lecturers demanded what they termed as ‘job security’ and suggested that   should retain them and must not seek new recruitment at their expense. “We have been working here for the last 4-5 years. How can government terminate our contracts at their whims? It has been brought to us that the government is kicking up new recruitment so that we could be ejected out. But this won’t be accepted and we will protest and boycott classes if this happens,” said Kalyan Singh, a member of Association of Extension Lecturers, Gurgaon. “We are not asking them to make us permanent,” one lecturer said. “We just want our job security. Our jobs are not secure.” “We have also demanded reduction of the number of periods per week,” Singh said. “We are supposed to attend 27 periods per week for non-practical classes and 30 periods per week for the practical classes. We want those to be reduced to 24 per week for non-practical classes and 27 per week for practical classes. This demand is not arbitrary. It is in accordance with the guidelines of  .”
 
 Lecturers also mentioned that they were currently getting a salary of Rs 25000, they want their salaries to be disbursed as per the ethics of equal pay for equal work and as per 7th pay commission as propounded by the Supreme Court. They said if the demand were not met before April, the month in which exams are scheduled, they will boycott the classes. These lecturers work on the ad hoc basis and currently take up to 60% of the workload.
