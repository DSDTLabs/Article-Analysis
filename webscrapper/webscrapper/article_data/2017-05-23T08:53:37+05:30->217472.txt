JAIPUR: Whether it is   or  , the farmers have no choice. They are forced to sell their produce at the throw away prices in the absence of holding power and also no space to store their prodcue.

 However, this will be a thing of past soon. Now, village cooperative societies will offer warehouse facility for a year to the farmers at a meagre rent of Rs 2 per sack per month.
 
 The   at Hingonia in Ajmer district has been pioneering the initiative. The society not only offers storage space but even provides 75% value of their produce at the existing market value on request. The society charges a 12% interest for it. This facility has been launched from April this year and if the famer was able to pay up the advance amount availed on time they will also give a discount of 2% on interest.
 
 The society has two godowns with a capacity of 100 and 250 metric tonne. The society issues policy at 75 market value of their produce. If the farmer is in need of money he could mortgage their policy to the society and avail the amount which is being transferred in to the account of the farmer. The farmers need not go to anywhere to weigh their produce as the society offers weight and measures facility free of cost.
 
 Rajasthan cooperative minister Ajay Singh Kilak said, “This is a progressive measure in the cooperative sector which will prevent distress sale by farmers.”
 
 He said some selected authorized societies would make this facility and would provide advance to the famers on request. And the 2% interest subsidy would act as an incentive to the farmers pay up their advance availed on time.
