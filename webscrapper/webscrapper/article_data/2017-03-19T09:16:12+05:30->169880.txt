MUMBAI:  , the 36-year-old   who weighed over 500kg until she underwent a   in a city hospital 10 days ago, is on the way to recovery but it could be a slow process. 

 Doctors have to not only monitor her kilos but also her poorly functioning lungs that have triggered a right-side heart failure as well as the multiple spells of epileptic fits she suffers every day.
 
 An update that her doctors at   in south Mumbai posted online on Saturday afternoon said, "We are happy to inform you that her post-op recovery is going fairly well."
 
 She is 358kg now, appreciably lower than the 498kg that she weighed when she touched down in Mumbai on February 11. "She lost 120kg in less than a month, but that was mainly the fluids," said Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, who heads the retinue of doctors working to 'Save Eman'.
 
 "The initial weight loss allowed us to operate safely and successfully. The battle is won, but the war is yet to be won. There is a long way to go before we can say Eman Ahmed is finally out of the woods," said Dr Lakdawala.
 
 He, in fact, said that the 90-minute surgery in which he cut her stomach down to a sleeve-shaped bag on March 7 was the "smallest part" of the treatment. "Even deciding her antibiotic dose is a long exercise, involving many doctors. We have to take care that one doctor's prescription isn't counter-productive to another's treatment," he added. "It is a tightrope walk on a daily basis. She is about 30% better than she was."
 
 Almost every organ seems to have suffered due to her morbidly obese frame that spanned five feet when she first came to India.
