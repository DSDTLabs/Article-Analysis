A few years ago, my partner and I were looking for a centrally located hotel in Manhattan that wouldn’t cost us the world. Travel websites directed us to one right in the middle of the city with just one con — a noisy lobby as it was a popular night stay option for school trips. Ah! Kids screaming across hallways is no disturbance for us Indians, so we promptly booked it.

 The next day we walked into a hotel lobby packed with more than 100 school kids and a handful of teachers. As I walked towards the elevators, I felt something amiss. And then it struck me — there was no noise. There were 100-odd kids but they weren’t talking to each other, much less screaming or running around. They were all slouching on various chairs and sofas, or against the wall, backs rounded, heads down and eyes zeroed in on their phone screens.
 
 Back home we have all seen that parents of kids, even as young as 18 months, are walking into flights, restaurants or even our homes with the iPads in hand. It’s like parents are under constant pressure to ensure that their children are not bored. And nothing like a phone, iPad or tab to overstimulate the bored child. Well, research is constantly saying that boredom is critical for a child and, in fact, essential for creativity to blossom. But then I am no expert on that subject so let me focus on what I do for a living — weight loss.
