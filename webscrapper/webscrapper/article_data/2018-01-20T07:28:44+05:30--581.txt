HYDERABAD: A day after MP   termed Sanjay Leela  's new movie 'Padmaavat' as 'bakwas', BJP MLA from Goshamahal   asked people to boycott the film and even burn down theatres that are going to screen the film. 

 Addressing a public meeting in   late on Wednesday night,   called on Muslims, particularly youth, to not watch 'Padmaavat' and waste their time and money. 
 
 But Raja Singh, who is trying to woo voters from Rajasthan, went a step ahead and said that people were even free to vandalise theatres. "I request the people to boycott the movie. You can even burn and vandalise theatres screening the film. No patriot should go and watch the movie. You should ensure that a director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali runs into losses and no other director attempts to tamper with history," he said in a video.
 
 He said that the director has only changed the name of the movie from 'Padmaavati' to 'Padmaavat', but the script remains the same. 
 
 The censor board has cleared the movie for release with several cuts and change in the name, keeping cultural and relgious sentiments of Rajputs in mind. He had earlier told a Rajasthani organisation that Bhansali was portraying the Rajput community in bad light. 
 
 Several film-lovers opposed the political statement saying opinions should not be imposed on people. 
 
 "Moral policing should be stopped as people are wise enough to decide whether to watch the film or not," said  , a techie.
 
 The   (TSFDC) said they did not receive any representation from any political party or organisation regarding the film. "The SC has ordered the release of the film and it is the responsibility of police to provide security to people visiting theatres," said K Murali Mohan, TSFDC secretary.
