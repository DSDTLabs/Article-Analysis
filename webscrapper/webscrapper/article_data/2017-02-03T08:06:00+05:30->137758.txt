GURUGRAM: The National   has directed the forest department in Gurugram to give audit details of trees it has planted in the   hills between 1990 and 2000. 

 The court inquired where all the trees have been planted using Rs 175 crore granted by the European Union, and asked for the report to be submitted by February 7.
 
 According to an estimate, nearly 3.3 crore trees were planted over 30,000 hectares, out of the 39,500 hectares across 13 districts that comprise the Aravali hills in the state. Plantation drives were carried out in many areas, including Gurugram, Faridabad, Mahendergarh, Rewari and Bhiwadi. 
 
 There are allegations that funds had been siphoned off after tree cover in the state was reported to have fallen. “As per India State of Forest Report, FSI of 2013, the forest and tree cover of Haryana remained at 2.90% of its geographical area, and only 3.9% of its area is notified as forest,” said Vivek Kamboj, a city-based environmentalist. “Huge funds have been granted, plenty of plantation drives have also been conducted in the Aravalis, yet, tree cover has remained the same, and in fact decreased. Surely, the department siphoned some funds. No efforts were made to look after the survival of the trees planted.”
 
 Others said an audit was already conducted in the past. “In 2007, a team comprising the district forest officer, mining officer and deputy commissioner was formed to carry out a satellite survey of the plantation. The survey was accurate to 20-feet elevation of each village and hill, and the reports were submitted to the state authorities and the Supreme Court,” said R P Balwan, former conservator of forests, Gurugram.
 
 The department recently formed a three-member committee to conduct review of plantation drives in the Aravalis. The directions were given in Lt Gen Satyevir Yadav (retd) vs Union of India and others case.
