KOCHI: People of Kochi have found new use for online taxis in the city by booking them online to deliver packages. "Today, a person booked a cab to deliver a large dinner set to Kacheripady. They had given me a number to follow up once I reached the location. 

 The customers did not accompany me, they were fine with handing over the responsibility of the packages to me," said an   driver.
 
 He said that once a hotel booked his cab to deliver about 30 packs of biryani to a location three kilometres away.
 
 Several drivers suggest that they often get booked to deliver small packages of goods from location to the other.
 
 Meanwhile, secretary of the online taxi drivers union   said the association discourages drivers from picking up and dropping parcels as they could get into serious trouble as the vehicles were registered as passengers vehicles and not goods vehicle.
 
 He said that there were further complications if the package was unaccompanied, as the driver would be held responsible for the content and safety of the package.
 
 "If the car is not registered as a goods vehicle then it cannot be engaged in transporting packages. But food items are not considered as goods as per the MVD Act," said regional transportation officer, Sadik Ali.
