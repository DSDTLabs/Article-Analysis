Smarting under an   that left BJP tantalizingly stranded at 99 seats,   on Tuesday went all out to please most  , especially the   in his budget for 2018-19.
 
 With the BJP now setting its sight on 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Patel presented a Rs 1,83,666 crore budget, wherein he gave a major thrust on jobs creation for youth and sops to farmers, senior citizens and women folk.
 
 Unemployment among youngsters was at the centre of all agitations spearheaded by the troika of Patidar quota warrior Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and Dalit rights activist Jignesh Mevani.
 
 Patel promised to create 30,000 new government jobs and even earmarked Rs 785 crore to generate employment for 3.5 lakh youngsters.
 
 He also earmarked Rs 6,755 crore to boost agriculture and farmer welfare, acknowledging difficulties faced by them. Farmers in five districts of Saurashtra had rooted out the BJP in December polls. Patel was given the crucial finance portfolio after he went public with his displeasure over portfolio allocation in December.
 
 With revenue resources in terms of state taxes curbed due to GST implementation, the FM turned to liquor by significantly raising excise duty and other levies. After 18 years, the excise duty on liquor has been tripled, which Patel said would help mop up an additional Rs 106 crore.
 
 The budgetsize for 2018-2019 is just marginally more (6.6%) than previous yearâ€™s (13.37%), mainly on account of the uncertainty in GST compensation from the Centre.
 
 However, he did not tweak state taxes like electricity duty, stamp duty or valueadded tax on petrol and diesel.
