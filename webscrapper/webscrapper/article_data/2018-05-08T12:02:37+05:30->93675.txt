PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Pollution levels of the Pavana, Mula and Indrayani rivers have come down, thanks to the  's efforts that stopped over 25-30 MLD of sewage from getting discharged into them. 

  has started a drive to stop nullahs from polluting the rivers. "We have taken measures such as replacing old broken pipes and repairing damaged chambers to ensure that sewage doesn't enter the rivers. We have also directed citizens in areas that did not have drainage networks initially, to take connections and release sewage into the civic drainage network," municipal commissioner   said. 
 
 The civic body has also laid a drainage pipeline network in slums to ensure that their sewage is transported to the nearest sewage treatment plant (STP). Around 220-230 MLD sewage of was being treated through the STPs. It has now increased to 255 MLD, and PCMC is planning to treat 275 to 280 MLD by next month, Hardikar added.
 
 Ravindra  , joint city engineer and chief of water supply and drainage department, said, "A detailed survey began on Monday wherein photographs of each drainage chamber were taken and pipelines were inspected to know the current condition. The broken pipelines will be repaired and those passing through the nullahs will be being shifted underground in the adjacent area along with the chambers inside the nullahs."
 
 The civic body is either replacing the old pipelines or laying additional pipelines and also adding the open drainage in gaothan areas to the civic drainage network, in order to cope with the needs of the growing population, Dudhekar added.
 
 Another civic official said that the industries releasing affluents into the nullahs too will be directed to take connection to the drainage pipeline network.
