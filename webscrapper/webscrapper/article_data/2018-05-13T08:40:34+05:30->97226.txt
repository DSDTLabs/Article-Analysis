NEW DELHI: Today's doodle shows a mother dinosaur and her baby walking side by side showing how a mother is always there for her children, guiding and protecting them.

 
 The day is especially dedicated to a woman who devotes her life to the well-being of her child and in return for this selfless love from her, she expects nothing.
 
 The custom of celebrating   on the second Sunday of May was first adopted by the United States, following which many other countries adopted the same. It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in the months of March or May. As many as 40 different countries mark the day.
 
 The modern holiday of Mother's Day was first celebrated in 1908, when   held a memorial for her mother at St Andrew's Methodist Church in Grafton, West Virginia.
 
 Jarvis wanted to honour her mother, hence set aside a day to recognise and appreciate the devotion of all mothers towards their child or children because she believed a mother is "the person who has done more for you than anyone in the world."
