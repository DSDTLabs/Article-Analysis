In a startling revelation, Sridevi, sister of deceased Tollywood actor Uday Kiran, said that it was Uday, who had taken the decision to call off marriage with Sushmitha, the eldest daughter of Chiranjeevi. 

 It is widely rumoured in the industry that Chiranjeevi and family had called off the wedding and that they were somehow instrumental in the down-slide of Uday Kiran’s career since then. Sridevi further said that Chiranjeevi had treated their family with utmost respect and had always stood by Uday Kiran and supported him morally, even after Uday had a break-up with a lady journo. 
 
 So much so, it was Chiranjeevi, who took the decision to make Uday, his son-in-law. However, Uday reportedly did not feel compatible with Sushmitha and subsequently decided to call off the marriage.
 
 Sridevi also said that his brother was not happy with his marriage to Vishita either. Stating that she had relocated to Oman after Uday’s marriage, Sridevi said that Vishita never spoke to them even on the phone. She said that Vishita never maintained any relations with them and did not speak to them even after Uday Kiran committed suicide.
