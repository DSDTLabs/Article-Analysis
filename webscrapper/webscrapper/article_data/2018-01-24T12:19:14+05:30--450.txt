PANAJI: With the decks having been cleared, Golden Globe Hotels Pvt Ltd (GGHPL) is gearing up to start its casino in Mandovi river early February.

 The captain of ports (CoP) department has allotted a jetty on the eastern side of the government jetty for feeder boats, an official said.
 
 The casino will be operated on board MV   Domino, which the company took on lease after its vessel Lucky Seven was grounded. Lucky Seven has since been sent for repairs, sources said.
 
 In December 2017, the state government had informed the high court of Bombay at Goa that GGHPL will be issued a jetty within a week for MV San Domino.
 
 GGHPL, a subsidiary of former   minister Gopal Kandaâ€™s MDLR Group, had filed an application seeking direction to captain of ports to allot a jetty to MV San Domino.
