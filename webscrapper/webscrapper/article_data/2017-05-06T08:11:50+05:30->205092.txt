PUNE: Comparing the recently announced National Health Policy 2017 with the previous one in 2002, Union minister for health and welfare   on Friday said the former is preventive in nature, while the latter was too disease-centric.

 He also said the new policy is universal and more people-centric.
 
 “The 2002 policy was very disease-specific. It focused on the urgent issues of the time, rather than the important issues. Whereas, the 2017 policy is preventive and promotive in its approach. With it, we will focus on early detection, and early defence against diseases,” he said while inaugurating the SYMHEALTH 2017 international conference on healthcare here.
 
 Nadda said the need of the hour is holistic, inter-disciplinary coordination with a focus on geriatric, palliative and rehabilitative care. He stated that all branches of healthcare need to come together, and be standardised.
 
 Talking about inclusion of all forms of treatment, Nadda said the new pathies to be included soon are osteopathy and acupuncture.
 
 “We are planning six new medical institutes of the scale of   ( ), and each of them will have a separate block for the department of Ayush,” Nadda said.
 
 He added at least 1.5 lakh public health centres will be turned to wellness centres offering free medical testing and prescription drugs under the new policy. Responding to a remark from Symbiosis founder and president,  , about the issues with medical education, Nadda said he will ensure it becomes affordable and accessible.
 
 Close to 1,300 delegates are attending the three-day event, organised by the   at Symbiosis International University.
