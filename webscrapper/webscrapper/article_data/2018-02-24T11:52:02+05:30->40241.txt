Most of the Bengali film buffs still remember   and   Mallick’s amazing jori in popular commercial hits. Both the actors appeared together in more than 20 films. Recently, Prosenjit even retweeted a clip that had Ranjit and Koel   and it would no doubt put a smile on any Bengali cine lover’s face.

 The clip was about an interview between the father-daughter duo, trying to figure out why the veteran actor was once called ‘The belt man.’
 
 Koel informs her father about the trolls she used to hear regarding Mallick’s famous dialogue ‘Chabke pither chaal tule debo’ (beating you till your skin peels off). Not just that, Koel reveals the hilarious title has even found its place on his Wikipedia page.
 
 What’s the funniest part is how Prosenjit responded to this video. He retweeted the clip along with a witty caption that reads, “Sobche beshi ami mar kheyechi,” (I am the man who was beaten up the most). Perhaps the celebrated actor recalled the good old days when he and Mallick shot such scenes in their film.
