HYDERABAD: Pointing out the short supply of generic medicines in stores opened under the Pradhan Mantri   Yojana, Nizamabad MP K   on Tuesday urged the Centre to allow state governments to source them from private pharmaceutical companies and make them available through PMJAY outlets.

 Speaking in the  , Kavitha said people who visit the stores were getting disappointed on being informed about non-availability of generic medicines. The medicines are supplied by the Bureau of Pharma PSU of India (BPPI) under the department of pharmaceuticals, ministry of chemicals and fertilizers.
 
 “Why should it be necessary only for the Centre to manufacture the medicines and send to the states? Ultimately, people should not be deprived of low-cost generic medicines only because supplies are not coming from the Centre,” she said.
 
 Under PMJAY, private entrepreneurs can also sell generic medicines following the procedures laid down. “The supplies from the Centre are coming to Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, but there is no supply to Telangana,” Kavitha said.
 
 The MP also referred to the Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (Amrit) scheme, through which cancer and heart disease medicines are supplied by the government at a discounted rate. “There are plans to open 300 outlets across the country. This is only duplication of work. Both generic medicines and Amrit scheme medicines should be available at the same stores,” she said.
