NEW DELHI: Aircraft staff loading things on a flight   from food carts lying on a road near IGI airport triggered a major scare ahead of the Republic Day on Wednesday night.

 After all, threat from food carts being loaded into an aircraft is seen as the biggest chink in aviation’s otherwise elaborate armour globally. A passer-by shot the video and sent it to senior airport officials, who forwarded it to the   agencies. Apparently, the catering van’s door had opened and some trolleys -- used for keeping food trays -- fell out.
 
 However, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has sent a stern warning to all food catering units near the airport to ensure that the sealed catering vans’ food storage units at the back do not open anywhere else except at the airport or flight catering kitchens’ loading/unloading section.
 
 Skygourmet, a leading flight catering firm, gave a detailed explanation to the security agencies regarding Wednesday’s incident. It said its vehicle (DL 1GB 6144) had left for terminal 3 at 5.35pm to load food trolleys on a flight and left the terminal around 9.40pm with used food trays of incoming flights.
 
 “On the way back to our unit, near   traffic light, there is a curve with speed breakers. At this point the vehicle’s rear door got unlatched… Dirty material collected from flights fell on the road,”   said in a written note.
 
 The flight catering firm said it has taken a “serious note” of the first of its kind incident. “The transport manager has been instructed to recheck all the locking devices and assemblies of the vehicles. Security department has been advised to ensure secondary checks are carried out for locking devices at the unit gate, while vehicles are moving out for airport activity,” the note added.
 
 All over the world, catering is the biggest worry for security agencies. A chef of a flight catering unit said: “We have to deploy the highest level of security for catering. The quality of food is checked in labs.”
