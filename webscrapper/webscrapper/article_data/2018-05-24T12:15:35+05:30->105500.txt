AMBALA: At a time when the police department is trying its best to curb traffic violations in the city by spreading awareness, there is nothing on the ground that is being witnessed. 

 According to   superintendent of police Abhishek Jorwal, a team under the leadership of assistant superintendent of police (ASP) has been constituted to keep a check on traffic violations and make public aware of road safety and traffic rules. "Our aim is to educate people on traffic rules and we are making strategies accordingly," the cops said.
 
 "We are spreading awareness by visiting different places in the city. In our ' ' programme, we have constitute teams to spread awareness through street plays," said ASP   Gahlaut.
 
 Nitika added that she had given targets to traffic police officers, for issuing maximum number of challans for traffic violations like using pressure horn, triple riding on a two-wheeler and riding without a helmet. 
 
 "Our department is giving rewards and incentives to the officers, who are issuing maximum number of challans. We have also started challaning people with the help of   cameras, and our postal challan branch is sending 15 to 20 challans every day to the violators," she said. 
 
 "Not only this, the traffic police department here has started a WhatsApp number (9729990101) on which public can provide information to the department about any noted traffic violation in the city. A challan will be issued to the violator. We are also running an operation called 'Durga' to keep a check on eve-teasing in the city," Nitika added. 
 
 Meanwhile, a TOI team found that 8 out of 10 people in the city were riding two-wheelers without any head protection, and this included both male and female commuters. It was also noted that the traffic police officers were letting the traffic violators go without challaning them. Issues like triple riding, motorcycles with noisy silencers and noisy horns are a common spectacle here.
