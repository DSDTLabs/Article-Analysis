AMRITSAR: Punjab minister Sikander Singh Maluka and   did not appear before “jathedars” appointed by the November 2015 self-styled  , at the Akal Takht on Monday to give clarifications on allegations of religious misconduct against them.

 In their absence, Akal Takht jathedar Dhian Singh Mand, Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar   and Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib jathedar   and two Sikh priests, Major Singh and Suba Singh, held a meeting at the Akal Takht and gave Maluka and Satnam another chance to appear before them on January 24. Daduwal said they had directed Sikh masses not to have social, religious, or political contact with the duo till January 24. 
 
 He added they had also received a report of the four-member committee that had been constituted by them under the leadership of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) executive member Surjit Singh Kalabula in both cases.
 
 Daduwal claimed that the SGPC-appointed jathedars had deliberately taken up only Maluka’s case to benefit him during the ensuing assembly elections in Punjab. “Maluka will be asking for votes. Once he completes the religious punishment, he will benefit. That is why the SGPC-appointed jathedars took up his case,” Daduwal said.
 
 He said the SGPC-appointed jathedars didn’t contemplate over the case of Satnam since there was no similar urgency as was in Maluka’s case.
 
 He said they had out rightly rejected the atonement pronounced upon Maluka by SGPC-appointed jathedars. “We have appealed to the ‘sangat’ to send us written suggestions on their opinion on the incidents of blasphemy,” said Daduwal.
