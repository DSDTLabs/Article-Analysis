PUNE: Two men robbed a tour operator of cash and a gold chain, collectively worth Rs 33,000, on the service road along the   bypass at Wakad late on Friday night.

 Complainant Anand Bakkanure (32) of   told TOI that the incident took place around 11.15pm when he was returning home. “I had stopped on the road to answer nature’s call when all of a sudden two men emerged from the dark and started threatening me. One of them was brandishing a sharp weapon. They threatened me to hand over my valuables, when I resisted, one of them hit me on my neck with his hands,” Bakkanure said.
 
 Bakkanure said the suspects then snatched his gold chain and Rs 3,000 from his wallet. They ran towards a car which was waiting at Bhumkar Chowk and fled. “The area was completely dark and I could not see the car’s registration number,” he added.
 
 Bakkanure said he was terrified due to the sudden attack. He went home and lodged a complaint with the Hinjewadi police the next day.
