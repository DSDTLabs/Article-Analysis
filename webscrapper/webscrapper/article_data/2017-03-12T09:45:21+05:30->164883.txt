BARNALA: Despite wresting power in Punjab, the Congress got a drubbing in Barnala district as it failed to retain any of the three seats that it had won in the 2012 assembly elections. In a big turnaround, this time AAP won all three even after fielding new faces. Two candidates of the Congress were even relegated to third spot. 

 Two-time Congress MLA Kewal Singh Dhillon lost to AAP’s debutant Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer from Barnala assembly constituency. Another two-time MLA Harchand Kaur lost to journalist-turned-politician Kulwant Singh Pandori from Mehal Kalan (reserve) constituency. Congress had replaced its sitting MLA Muhammad Sadiq from Bhadaur (reserve) constituency with Joginder Singh Panjgrain, the legislator from Jaito in Faridkot district. Panjgrain lost to AAP’s Pirmal Singh Khalsa.
 
 Only in Barnala assembly constituency Congress’s Dhillon put up resistance as he lost by 2,432 votes whereas at Mehal Kalan and Bhadaur, AAP candidates Pandori and Pirmal won by 27,064 and 20,784 votes, respectively.
