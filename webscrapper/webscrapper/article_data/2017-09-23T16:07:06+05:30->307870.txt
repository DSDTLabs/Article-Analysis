GREATER NOIDA: Police on Saturday arrested a man associated with   for forcing meat a shops to shut down during   in Greater Noida. The accused have been identified as Ved Nagar, head of the outfit.

 In the last one week the outfit had forced several meat shops to shut down at different places in Greater Noida.
 
 Manish Saxena, Noida Police PRO, said that the police received information that Nagar along with some supporters would again try to shut down meat shops on Saturday. “Police also received information from media that he was involved in such arbitrary activities. We traced the accused in Acheja village and arrested him under Section 151 of IPC," he said.
 
 The outfit had earlier claimed it had petitioned the district administration and Badalpur police station last month to stop meat sales during Navratri but decided to go ahead and do it itself when it received no response. After that, fearing vandalism, many more meat and fish sellers decided to shut their shop voluntarily.
 
 DM BN Singh said that he directed the police officials to take action against such people who try to disturb peace and tranquility. “We will not allow any person to breach law and order situations," he said.
 
 Earlier Gautam Budh Nagar SP (rural) Suniti said that the local intelligence units have been sensitized to report such matters if they get any such information. “SHOs have also been asked to ensure law and order is not compromised anywhere," she said.
