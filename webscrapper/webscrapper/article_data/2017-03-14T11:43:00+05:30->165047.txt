The animosity grew so bitter that  , despite knowing about Ajay’s plans of making a film on the Battle of  , announced his movie on the same subject along with 
  as co-producer and 
  as the male lead.
 
 However, latest news has it that   has backed out of the film and won't be producing the film with KJo.
  
 Reportedly, the ‘Dabangg’ actor was unaware about Ajay too making a film on similar grounds, and thus he gave a nod to KJo for co-producing the film. Upon learning about Ajay’s plans, the loyal friend that   is, he reportedly backed out of the film to avoid any tension with good pal Ajay.
  
 Will   still go ahead with this film? only time will tell...
