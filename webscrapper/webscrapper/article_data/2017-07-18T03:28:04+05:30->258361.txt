BENGALURU: After media reports of her enjoying privileges, including a special kitchen in Central Jail, Parappana Agrahara, AIADMK leader   was on Monday restricted to plebeian comforts like other prisoners.

 Unlike other days when she would have idlis or dosas specially cooked for her, she had lime rice and tea like other inmates around 7.30am, a source said. According to the prison manual, lime rice is the Monday breakfast menu. She had ragi rotti and curd rice for lunch, which the kitchen staff prepared for her. Usually,   would have non-vegetarian lunch.
 
 “For dinner, she would usually have chapatis and curd rice. But today, she may have ricesambar served to other convicts,” sources said.
 
 But Sasikala continues to wear colourful clothes as she had taken permission from officials. “White clothes is mandatory only for those convicted for seven or more years. Since Sasikala’s sentence is below seven years, outgoing jail chief superintendent Krishna Kumar granted her permission to wear ordinary clothes,” a source said. “Prison officials have disconnected cable connection to TVs in the barracks,” the source said. Sasikala’s barracks are located on the ground floor of the two-storey women’s cell.
 
 The privileges she had been allegedly accorded included a double cot with a new mattress, a new fan, water heater, mineral water cans, an instant coffee maker and a LED TV set. A gas stove and utensils had been kept for her and a part of the common kitchen was set aside.
