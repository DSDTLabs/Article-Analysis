Nagpur: Sachin Getme (35), a traffic constable, died after falling into a well while he was repairing the water motor on Monday. However, it is unclear whether he slipped into the well or got electrocuted.

 Sachin, a resident of Sneha Nagar in Bokhara village near Koradi Naka, was found in the well by his father Dhanraj. The Getmes would use water from the well whenever they needed as the owner of the newly constructed house was yet to shift to the place.
 
 Cops said Dhanraj came outside to invite Sachin for breakfast. But when he failed to find him, he approached the well and looked inside. As Dhanraj, a retired assistant sub-inspector screamed in shock, neighbours immediately rushed to the spot. A few youngsters stepped into the well and found him unconscious.
 
 They covered Sachin’s body with a blanket and tied it with a rope to pull him outside. But he breathed his last while was being taken to the hospital.
 
 A relative told TOI, “Sachin has sustained several injuries on his back. He probably slipped into the well while he was repairing the water motor and received injuries due to the steps built of cement.”
 
 The Koradi police, who have registered a case of accidental death, are yet to ascertain whether he slipped into the well or got electrocuted. Sachin leaves behind wife Sarita, three-year-old daughter Pari, parents and a host of relatives.
