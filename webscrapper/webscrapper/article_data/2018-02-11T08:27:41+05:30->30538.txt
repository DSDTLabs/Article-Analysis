CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal has sought registration of fresh FIR against senior   leader   for his alleged involvement in massacre of Sikhs in 1984 stating he should be subjected to polygraphy and narco test apart from impounding his passport. 

 He lauded the role of the NDA government and home minister   to bring perpetrators of the 1984 anti-Sikh massacres to the book by referring new disclosures in the case against Tytler to SIT head Justice S N Dhingra (retired). Terming it as a huge victory for the massacre victims, who have been waiting for justice since 33 years, Badal said even the role of former Prime Minister   would be under scanner for the first time because new evidence linked him directly with the Congress leaders who had led mobs that killed Sikhs in Delhi.
 
 Sukhbir said in its letter written to the SIT chairman, the   had asked it to investigate new facts that had emerged after Tytler's disclosure to a television channel that he had travelled with Rajiv Gandhi in a car on November 1, 1984, in specific areas of Delhi where Sikhs were attacked and killed. The letter had also asked to investigate disclosures with reference to involvement of Congress leaders Tytler,  , HKL Bhagat and   in the case, said Badal. "It also states that these disclosures might have a relation with 186 cases that are being further investigated by the SIT constituted by the Supreme Court," added Badal.
 
 The SAD chief added the Union government had also given reference to the Nanavati Commission report that had recorded most number of Sikhs were butchered in areas where Rajiv Gandhi visited on November 1, 1984.
