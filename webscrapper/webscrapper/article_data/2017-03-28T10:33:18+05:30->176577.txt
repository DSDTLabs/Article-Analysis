NAGPUR: All opposition parties in the state have joined hands to put pressure on the BJP-led   government for declaring waiver for farmers’ loans. Top leaders and legislators of the Congress, NCP, Peasants and Workers Party, Samajwadi Party, RPI (Kawade) and AIMIM are expected to participate in the symbolic ‘Chanda to Banda Shetkari Sangharsh Yatra’ that will start from Sindewahi in Chandrapur on Wednesday and touch Banda in Konkan. A rally will be held at Panvel on April 3.

 Ironically, the last   was one of the best for agriculture in most parts of the state after the drought that preceded it. Major crops like cotton as well pulses had record yields. However, this led to over-supply, prices falling and farm incomes coming down.
 
 With the state budget ignoring the Opposition demand for loan waiver, these parties will traverse across the state to express sympathy with distressed farmers.
 
 “When we move out in villages, we see farmers in great distress unable to repay loans as farm incomes are low while costs are scaling every year. The government should come to rescue of farmers by giving a timely relief from unpaid dues,” said Anil Deshmukh, ex-minister and NCP leader.
 
 Deshmukh admitted that loan write off in 2006 did not end farmers’ suicides crisis in the state, but demands a helping hand to gives farmers to start afresh. “When the government can borrow large sums to implement 7th pay commission for its staff, why not take some more external loans to bail out the distressed farmers?” said Deshmukh.
 
 Former CM and MPCC president Ashok Chavan, state NCP chief Sunil Tatkare, former CM Prithviraj Chavan, leader of opposition in Assembly   and his Council counterpart Dhananjay Munde will lead the march. The leaders will begin the march from the city on Wednesday around 8am after garlanding Mahatma Gandhi statue. Roadside public meetings will be held all through the route.
