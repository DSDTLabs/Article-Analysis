 Tanvi  , a resident of Umarpada, fell unconscious after writing her science paper for two hours in a classroom of Swaminarayan school in Adajan. She was administered saline and a full body check-up was conducted in NCH. 
 
 Her father Shyamsinh Vasava said, “She used to have attacks of fits, but she has not had any in the last two months. Since she used to have it often earlier, I brought her to our village Dhanawad in Umarpada taluka and registered her as an external student.” 
 
 “Tanvi still wants to write her remaining papers as she is confident that she would pass in science too,” he said adding, “She wants to study further but unfortunately we don’t have proper school for higher secondary education, so we have come 200km from our native to Surat.” 
 
 Tanvi’s parents said, “There is a two-day gap between second and third papers and we hope she would recover well to write remaining papers.” 
 
 Shayamsinh works as a farm labourer and the family is put up at a village relative’s house in Surat for Tanvi’s exams.
