TIRUPUR: The   commissioner has issued a 10-point dos and don’ts for his subordinates to be followed during vehicle inspection. 

 The advisory has been circulated following the death of a   after a traffic police inspector kicked a motorbike in which she was riding pillion with her husband in Trichy last week. 
 
 In the circular, Tirupur city police commissioner P   said the police personnel should not develop ego over motorists if they failed to stop their vehicles during inspection. 
 
 “The personnel should understand that minor offence by motorists would fall under road traffic rules violation and not crime activities,” the commissioner said.
 
 “If any driver failed to stop the vehicle when the police asked him/her to halt it, the police should not try to chase the vehicle. Instead, the registration number of the vehicle should be noted down and communicated to higher officials for further action,” Nagarajan said in the circular.
 
 “The police should not involve in vehicle inspection by standing either on the centre of the road or in a secluded place. During patrol duties, the constables should not involve in the vehicle inspection unless they were accompanied by sub-inspector rank policemen. Moreover, officials should ensure the personnel of   (TSP), who were deployed in police station duties, were under their control.”
 
 “The vehicles driven by women should not be intercepted unnecessarily. If there was suspicion, the police can stop the vehicles driven by men seemed to be aged between 18 and 30.”
 
 The commissioner said, “If any motorists engage in quarrel with the police, the personnel should immediately record the incident in a video and hand over the video to higher officials for further action.”
 
 “Since, if any policeman or policewoman commits mistake during vehicle inspection, such action will affect the whole department. So, the personnel should work honestly,” he appealed.
