SURAT: Diamantaires dealing with buyers in the   ( ) are upbeat as the government there has decided to exempt gold and diamonds from value added tax (VAT). 

 
 It must be recalled that export of gold jewellery and polished diamonds had declined considerably following implementation of five per cent VAT charges on gold and diamonds from January 2018.
 
 Industry experts believe that five per cent VAT on diamonds in the UAE, which has emerged as the world’s largest diamond trading hub after Antwerp, has had a huge cost implications for Indian importers of rough diamonds and those selling polished diamonds in the UAE.
 
 Following the imposition of five per cent VAT in the UAE, diamond importers in India had to shell out 5.25 per cent tax on the value of rough diamonds with the Indian government introducing 0.25 per cent GST on import of rough diamonds.
 
 Most of the large diamond companies in India have set up their offices in   (DMCC) in the last decade. A significant value of rough diamonds are imported from the UAE every year.
 
 The US-based Rapaport group quoted chairman of   (DDE) Peter Meeus saying, “The possible cost implications of VAT introduction for the UAE traders are huge. In a business where profit margins are very thin, every quarter of a per cent is important for traders handling billions of dollars to decide where to ship the goods.”
 
 The value of diamonds traded in the UAE rose to $26 billion in 2016, compared with $300 million in 2002 when the DMCC was established.
 
 Diamond analyst Aniruddha Lidbide said, “VAT in the UAE was imposed just recently and it had a huge cost implications on loose diamonds. Now that the UAE has scrapped the VAT, it is a good news for the entire diamond value chain.”
