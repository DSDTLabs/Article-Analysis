Ludhiana: Residents are outraged at the municipal corporation’s failure to ensure cleanliness in the city. Heaps of garbage and stones have been lying on Model Town’s main road since the past few months, but no permanent action has been taken on it by the civic body. Not only are there heaps of garbage, but also debris from buildings, and waste from hotels lying on the road. It has now become a home ground for dogs, cattle, mosquitoes, and insects.

 Residents say there should either be a proper dumping area, or roads should be cleaned on a regular basis. “The MC should either make sure the garbage and debris are dumped in a proper way and not thrown on the roads, or they should clean the roads on a regular basis” said Model Town resident Ayush Chaudhary.
 
 Some people complain that the municipal corporation used to clean the road only at the time of election, otherwise they hardly care about cleaning the road. “When it was election time, the municipal corporation used to clean the road regularly, but after the polls got over, I have never seen them cleaning the road. It was just a cheap way of seeking votes,” said another Model Town resident Ishita Goyal.
 
 People say the heaps of garbage and debris may lead to many environmental issues. “An open dump leads to a lot of environmental problems and diseases. Dengue is common because of such home grounds for insects and mosquitoes. If the MC gets the dump cleared, the road will also widen up,” said Dugri resident Manya Mahajan.
 
 Many people are also worried about   spoiling the image of the city. “Looking at the heaps of garbage piled on the roads, who will call us smart citizens? The Model Town road is beautiful, but garbage lying over there defaces the road as well as the city. The biggest irony is that right where the garbage and debris are piled up, in front of it is a hoarding that reads ‘Keep your city clean and green’, ” said Rashi Jain, a resident of Model Town Extension.
