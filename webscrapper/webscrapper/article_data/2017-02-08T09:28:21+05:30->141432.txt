COIMBATORE:  , a silambam and karate champion, could not afford the 40,000 needed for his trip to Malaysia, despite getting selected to represent India at the event. 

 Social workers and citizens stepped in to crowdsource the funds to help Gauthaman participate in the   Championship 2017, at which he won the gold medal. The NGOs that collected funds and funded his trip are Edu dharma,  , Ayuda Foundation, Lit the light and feed the need. "Through a Chennai-based NGO named Lit the light, we got to know about him. Two NGOs from Coimbatore, Edudharma, a crowdsourcing website and Aakkam foundation, a WhatsApp group, collected more than 25,000 for him," said   of Aakkam Foundation. They were informed about it only in January, three days before the deadline. "He was selected among 12 from across India. But due to lack of funds, he was thinking of backing out," said N Balaji of Edudharma. 
 
  "Silambam is our traditional martial art and I want to popularize it. I am thankful to all those who helped me achieve this," he said.
