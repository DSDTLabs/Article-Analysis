Pune: Four persons on Wednesday morning hacked a 17-year-old criminal on police records to death on Talegaon-Induri Road, about 40km from here.

 The Pune Rural police have launched a search to trace the suspects, who fled in a car after the brutal murder. “The deceased youth had four cases — a murder, attempt to murder and two robberies — registered against him,” said Ganpatrao Madgulkar, the sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Dehu Road.
 
 The SDPO said the youth was murdered around 8.30am when he and his friend were riding a motorcycle. The suspects followed them in a car. “The car driver dashed his vehicle against the motorcycle near a restaurant on the Talegaon-Induri Road,” Madgulkar said.
 
 After the youth and his friend fell off the bike, the suspects brandishing sharp weapons got down from the car. “Seeing them, the youth and his friend started running. The suspects chased the youth and assaulted him with the sharp weapons,” Madgulkar said.
 
 The youth died on the spot. His friend escaped unhurt in the attack. The suspects fled in the car. An officer of the Pune Rural police said the reason behind the murder was not known. “We suspect an old rivalry could be the cause behind the youth’s murder,” he said.
