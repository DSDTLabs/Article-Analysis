NOIDA: A 900-metre stretch between   and   Crossing in Noida will remain out of bounds for vehicles until construction of the extended   is over, traffic police have said in an advisory.

 The advisory said no vehicle would be allowed on the stretch between SJM Hospital in Chijarsi village and Ayush Motors near Model Town Crossing from 6am on Saturday. Travellers have been advised to either use the other flank of the road or NH24 to move between the two points.
 
 “The road from Chijarsi to Model Town will remain closed. The road on the opposite side will be functional,” traffic inspector Layak Singh said. “Traffic will be usual at the Model Town Crossing. This will allow vehicles coming from Ghaziabad to enter Noida. People can also navigate through Model Town Crossing to go to Ghaziabad and Delhi,” Singh said.
 
 Traffic police have not given any timeframe for the route diversion, but merely said the 900-metre stretch would be closed “until work is over” on the metro project. Teams will be deployed at specific points and signboards put up to guide the diverted traffic.
 
 The district administration on Friday conducted an encroachment drive and removed unauthorised structures from near Chijarsi T-point for the widening of NH24. The structures coming in the way of the widening project included a Shani temple, which, too, would be relocated.
 
 Amit Kumar Singh, the SHO of Phase 3 police station, said: “The idols have been temporarily shifted to a neighbourhood Durga temple. The Shani temple was razed.”
