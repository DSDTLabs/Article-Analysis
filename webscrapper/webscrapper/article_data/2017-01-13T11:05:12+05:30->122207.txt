SURAT: Of the thousands  , who queued up outside banks and   (ATMs) after demonetization of high value currency notes on November 8, 2016 by the central government, some of them were forced to adopt digital mode of payments to reduce their hardship. However, collection of Rs 1.16 crore fine in cash by city police from traffic rule offenders in December 2016 shows that the cops remain unmoved by this whole hullabaloo by the government over the need to go  .

 It is over two months since demonetization happened but the city police are reluctant to go ‘cashless.’ The average daily collection of cash fine from traffic offenders in December, 2016 was Rs3.76 lakh cash. Surprisingly, the per day cash fine has shown an upward trend from January 1. From January 1 to 10, the city police collected Rs4.19 lakh on the spot cash fine per day from traffic offenders. 
 
 City police stopped collecting on the spot cash fine from traffic offenders for a few days after demonetization was announced. Till November 30 collection of total cash fine was very less but police started collecting fine like routine from December 1.
 
 “Police should collect fine from those who violate traffic rule, but they should provide payment options to an offender. If someone wants to make digital payment towards fine, he or she should be given the option,” said  , a resident of Adajan. “Traffic police have started the procedure to become cashless by procuring swipe (point of sale/PoS) machines to collect fine. These machines can only be supplied by banks but we are working to speed up the process,” said S G Bhati, in-charge joint commissioner of police, traffic.
