THANE: Car registration has touched an all-time high with 18 per cent last fiscal compared to 2016-17 at the   ( ) that covers Thane, Bhiwandi and Bhayander jurisdictions. 

 Based on the records at the Thane RTO, registration of private cars, which was 16,156 in 2014-15, increased by over 20 per cent as the sales were around 19,499 in 2017-18. The officials have attributed this rise to poor public transport and easy loan availability, with interest rates ranging between 8.25 per cent and 10.5 per cent, and most bankers offering to waive off the loan processing charges.
 
 “As compared to the earlier times it is now easier to purchase a new vehicle as people easily get loans with minimal down payment. Also, one need not go to the bank as either the staff from the bank comes home or the same can be done online. Another reason for many opting to get their own vehicle is because the frequency of public transport is poor. People do no wish to wait for a bus for longer or go in the crowd. They instead prefer taking their cars to their destination,” said  , deputy RTO,Thane.
 
 Citizens even continued to buy bikes or scooters as they are easier to manoeuvre, said experts. Also, a rise of around 25 per cent was seen against the registration of two-wheelers in 2017-18 as compared to 2014-15. It was seen that out of the 82,999 two-wheelers registered in 2017-18, around 11 per cent were motorcycles. 
 
 “Everyone aspires to own a vehicle, which is a psychological behaviour and two-wheelers are pocket-friendly as compared to cars. Most of the youngsters prefer taking a two-wheeler as it becomes convenient for them to go to another city and they do not even have to pay the toll. Also, as compared to public transport it becomes easier to travel by a bike or scooter as it turns out to be cheaper,” said  , transport expert.
