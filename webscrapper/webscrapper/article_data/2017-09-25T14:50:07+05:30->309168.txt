MUMBAI: World Championship quarterfinalists   and   Bisht will be the star attractions at the 67th Inter-Service Boxing Championship to be conducted by the Indian Navy from Tuesday.

 While Amit (49kg) will be turning up for the Indian Army, Kavinder (52kg) will represent the Indian Air Force in the event.
 
 A total of 80 boxers, representing Army Green, Army Red, Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force, will be vying for the top honours at the prestigious in-house tournament of the defence forces.
 
 The Indian Navy team is being coached by former Asian champion and   gold-medallist M Suranjoy Singh. Suranjoy, in his prime, had won eight back-to-back gold medals for India in the flyweight category.
 
 Both Amit and Kavinder have exceeded expectations with their performances in their breakthrough year at the senior level.
 
 Amit had won a bronze medal at the Asian Championships earlier this year before making the   quarterfinal last month when he lost to reigning Olympic champion Hasanboy Dusmatov of Uzbekistan.
 
 Kavinder, on the other hand, had finished a quarterfinalist in both the Asian and World Championships.
 
 The 22-year-old from Uttarakhand fought his world event quarterfinal despite sustaining two cuts on the face in his previous bout.
