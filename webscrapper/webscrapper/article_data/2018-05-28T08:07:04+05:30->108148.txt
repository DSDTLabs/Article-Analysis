 The representatives of   (SEER), and unions farm, teacher, student and labour bodies, also participated in the protest. Most of the protesters were of theview that the molasses spill in the Beas river was an unpardonable offence and government should come forward to stop it by giving exemplary punishment.
 
 ‘Paani Bachao, Punjab Bachao’ panel has decided to meet the chief minister, Punjab Pollution Control Board chairperson, and approach the   and the Punjab and Haryana high court. They have also decided to take the agitation to other districts, including Bathinda, Muktsar and Moga.
 
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA   said not only people of Punjab, but even residents of   were affected by the spillage. The panel appealed to the people to raise their voice against industrial units throwing industrial waste in canals. “We want these canals, which are like a lifeline of people, to be free of toxins. We will not sit back till the authorities give a serious thought to it,” he said.
