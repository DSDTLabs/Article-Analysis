AMARAVATI: The `smart' budget presented by AP finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Wednesday betrays the political smartness of the ruling Telugu Desam Party as it targets every section of society, strikes a balance between welfare and development, focuses on the youth by providing them with unemployment allowance, woos Dalits, BCs, SCs, STs, and minorities, introduces a `gender budget' for the overall “uplift, protection and empowerment“ of women and opens the doors for global investors in “sunrise state.“

 Incidentally, this is the first budget to be presented on the AP soil and the government wants to maintain an annual growth rate of 12 per cent. “I am extremely privileged to be a part of this momentous occasion of bringing back legislative power to the historical city of Amaravati after nearly 2,000 years,“ Ramakrishnudu said. Halfway through the fiveyear governance term, the TDP government does not want to leave any section or group disappointed. Besides offering 10,000 new jobs apart from the earlier announced 12,552 government posts, the budget 2017-18 has focused on the numerically strong, but angry Kapu community, which is fighting for a quota in jobs and education, by allocating Rs 1,000 crore, and the Brahmins (Rs 75 crore). About 10 lakh houses will be constructed for the economically backward sections in the next two years. Smart cities project will get Rs 450 crore.
 
 For the Christians, the government increased the subsidy component from Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000 for pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
 
 The maximum permissible amount for construction of churches has also been increased from Rs one lakh to Rs 3 lakh. For the first time post bifurcation, an assessment of the wakf properties will be made at a cost of `50 crore to protect them from encroachment. Imams and Muezzins in mosques without income will get Rs 5,000 and Rs 3,000 per month each respectively, the highest honorarium paid in the country by any state.
