KOLHAPUR: The Regional Transport Office (RTO) has started its free fitness   for   and buses.

 “Those who fail to produce their vehicles for inspection will face actions like suspension of licence and permit,” said deputy regional transport officer Steven Alvares on Monday.
 
 Illegal   business is a challenge before the transport office as only a month is left for the beginning of the new academic year. Hence, the RTO has organised the   test for school vans and buses across the district. The last day for getting a vehcile checked is May 31.
 
 Talking about the fitness drive, Alvares said, “School transport is directly connected with the life of the students. Therefore, these vehicles need to be fit to ply on the road. If a vehicle owner fails to comply with the instruction and does not produce his vehicle, he can lose his permit or licence.”
 
 Prithviraj Patil, a school van owner, said, “Security of the students is the responsibility of the school van owner. Hence, the vehicle should be kept fit for transport. The RTO has initiated this fitness test and it is our responsibility to cooperate with them.”
 
 Another vehicle owner, on condition of anonymity, said, “The RTO initiates some measures at the beginning of the academic year, while for the rest of the year it hardly pays any attention on illegal school transport business.”
