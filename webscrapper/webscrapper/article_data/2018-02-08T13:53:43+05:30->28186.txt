SURAT: It was last year when the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had approved the scope of work for expansion of existing terminal building at  . Even after an year, the   is yet to take up the work for expanding the terminal building, which is bursting following the increased passenger traffic. 

 From just 30,000 passengers per month in April-2017, the passenger traffic at Surat airport has seen a sharp increase at 63,000 passengers per month. The average monthly flight movements have increased from 647 in April-2017 to almost 1,000 per month in January-2018. 
 
 At present, the terminal building is having peak hour passenger handling capacity of merely 250 passenger — 125 arrivals and 125 departures — against the required capacity of 2,500 passengers per day.
 
 As per the rough estimate, the present capacity to handle passengers at the terminal building is 2 lakh per annum. At present, there are around 8 lakh passengers travelling to and from the Surat airport per annum in 21 flights operated by  , private operator Ventura Airconnect and Non-Schedule Operator Permit (NSOP). 
 
 Also, there are only six check-in counters and three airlines using it and few more airlines interested to start! However, at least 20-25 check-in counters are needed to cater to the increasing passenger rush on the airport. 
 
 AAI has approved expansion of the terminal building on February 8, 2017, but things are moving at a snail’s speed. There is a proposed expansion of the building by 12,000 sq metre to cater to 400 domestic plus 300 international passengers. However, this scheme shall be taken up based on the assessment of potential of international traffic and growth of domestic traffic in Surat.
 
 “The passenger load in all the aircrafts from Surat is almost 90 per cent, still the AAI is not interested in expanding the terminal building. The monthly passenger traffic is almost 63,000 and the airport urgently needs the expansion in order to facilitate the increasing traffic,” an airport activist said.
