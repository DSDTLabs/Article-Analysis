HYDERABAD: Actor-turned-politician   has found fault with   governor Ch   Rao for the continuing suspense over the chief minister's post in Tamil Nadu. 

 "He was my one-time colleague in the BJP. I see no reason why he is not taking a decision," the former MP said on Saturday. However, she supported 'Chinnamma' for the CM's post. "Sasikala has the support of majority of the MLAs," she pointed out. Vijayashanti was in the BJP for several years before she played an important role in the   (TRS). "There is so much avoidable uncertainty in Tamil Nadu just because the governor is taking too much time even when it is clear who he should invite to form the government," she said.
