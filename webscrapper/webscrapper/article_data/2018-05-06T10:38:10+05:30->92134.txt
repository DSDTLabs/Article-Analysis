MYSURU: In a last-minute move on Saturday, BJP national president   dropped his plan to campaign in Varuna where he was to hold a roadshow.

 
 The BJP chief held his roadshow in a different part of the segment after intelligence reportedly indicated that supporters of BY Vijayendra were still smarting from the Varuna fiasco and could create trouble for denying a ticket to their leader.
 
 However, party leaders were quick to deny it. They said the venue was shifted to hold a joint roadshow for T Narasipura candidate â€“ S Shankar and Varuna candidate T Basavaraju as part of T Narasipura town falls within the Varuna assembly segment.
 
 Sources claimed supporters of Vijayendra had planned bike rallies from different locations to Hadinaaru village to duck the roadshow. Sensing trouble, BJP leaders changed the venue. Shah held a roadshow at T Narasipura with Varuna candidate, T Basavaraju, and T Narasipura candidate, S Shankar.
 
 Vijayendra was the cynosure of all eyes and it was he who shored up support all through. Shah also skipped his campaign in the Chamundeshwari segment.
