Nagpur: A melting pot of emotions, the fourth day of the ongoing Mahagenco Inter-Power Station Theatre Competition at Scientific Society Hall saw two plays — ‘Poha Chalala Mahadeva’ a presentation by Khaparkheda Power Station and ‘Shevanta Jitti Hay’ a presentation by Pophali Power Station — being staged.  The descent into madness of a struggling mother who realizes the only hope of her life has been extinguished was the central plotline of the first play ‘Shevanta Jitti Hay’. It was directed by Bhaskar Shegaonkar and Mahendra Raut. Madhuri Ganoje who portrayed the role of the mother said, “The biggest challenge was playing a mentally disturbed woman. I read the script multiple times and immersed myself into the character so as to get a grip on her personality”.  Depicting the threat which a crime witness faces was the second play ‘Shevanta Jitti Hay’. In the play, the police force of a town is looking for Shevanta, who left no trace except a writing on a lavatory wall of a train coach ‘Shevanta is alive’. Talking about the subject of the play director Mangesh Dongre said, “This is common, people who witness crime scenes fear to come forward as they are insecure about their own safety.”  Great attention to detail was paid while designing the sets of both the plays, said stage manager of ‘Shevanta Jitti Hay’. “I and my team tried to incorporate everything which the scripts demanded and made everything on our own,” he added.  Suvarna Patil, mother of supporting actor, Vinayak Patil of ‘Shevanta Jitti Hay’ said, “I always attend all the performances of my son. It is really nice to see him transform into an altogether different person on stage.” ‘Garambicha Bapu’ by Chandrapur Power Station and ‘Dar Saal Dar Shekada’ by Mumbai Power Station will be staged on Saturday.
