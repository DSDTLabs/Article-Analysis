LUCKNOW: For   chief  , his cousin   is a villain and destroyer of the family and party but for Mulayam’s son chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and his followers, he is the Chanakya, who single-handedly demolished the camp of the old guards.

 Mulayam has charged Ram Gopal with destroying the Samajwadi Party and the family at the behest of the BJP, given that the family of   is facing CBI inquiry into the multi-crore-rupee scam involving Yadav Singh, former chief engineer of Noida, Greater Noida and the Yamuna Expressway authority. Ram Gopal’s son and party MP Akshay Yadav has been interrogated by the CBI in this connection.
 
 Since the CBI has gone slow on the investigations,   has strong reason to believ Ram Gopal is following the directions of the BJP to save his skin.
 
 The SP chief had sacked Ram Gopal for six years last month for his comments but when Ram Gopal tendered a tearful apology in public, Mulayam reinstated him. Whether he was settling scores with the party chief for expelling him, or was determined to project Akhilesh as the future of the party, there is no denying that Ram Gopal planned and executed the entire operation to dislodge his rivals Amar Singh and Shivpal rather meticulously. 
 
 Mulayam feels it was Ram Gopal who brainwashed his son Akhilesh Yadav and “ruined his career”. In the father-son duel, Ram Gopal did not intervene to settle their differences and instead, backed Akhilesh to the hilt. He wrote two letters in which he condemned Mulayam as a leader of an era bygone and supported Akhilesh. Barring Ram Gopal Yadav, there is none in the Akhilesh Yadav camp who could work so meticulously and get majority of the delegates in favour of the chief minister.
