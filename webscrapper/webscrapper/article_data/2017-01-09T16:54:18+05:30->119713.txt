Equations and friendship doesn't take time to change in the house.   and  , who became close friends in Manu's absence and were also romantically linked-up by the housemates are now at loggerheads. During the Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Salman asked for everyone’s opinion on Manveer’s captaincy.
 
  
 
  
  Most of the housemates were of the opinion that Manveer has not been able to maintain disciple and hygiene inside house and has failed to pay attention to basic things. Manveer takes this feedback to heart and ensures that everyone is following the rules starting that very minute.
  
  In the morning, Bani is warned by Bigg Boss not to speak in English while she is having a conversation with Nitibha. Manveer interrupts their conversation and sits in front of them to keep a check on them. Soon after, Bigg Boss pulls up Nitibha for repeating the same mistake twice after which she hides from Manveer in the kitchen area.
  
  Manveer catches her and lashes out at her for breaking the rules again and again. Nitibha tries to give a justification but Manveer leaves her tongue-tied. One thing leads to another and Nitibha ends up saying that Manveer could do no good as a captain for the last 7 days. She hurls abuses at him when Manveer loses his composure and they both get into an ugly fight. They both have a yelling match after which the housemates try to get in between and calm them down.
