For a newbie who is yet to make her debut in the Kannada film industry,   sure is going places. The New Zealand-born Kannada hudugi’s first film, director Mahesh Babu’s as-yet-untitled venture with  , is nearing completion, and Latha is already on her third film here. “Mahesh sir has a knack of finding people who go on to do well in films, be it Aindrita Ray, Kriti Kharbanda or Ashika Ranganath, among others. And it looks like I am next in line,” says Latha excitedly, speaking to us during a break from dubbing for her Kannada debut. “Mahesh sir has been complaining that I am not giving him dates for the song shoot of our film, as I have been busy with my second film, Gelayana Gelathi, a love triangle for which I have finished my portions. It’s being made by a new team and is not a stereotypical commercial potboiler. And now, I have signed my third film, the Kannada remake of the Malayalam hit  , called  , in which I will take on Parvathy’s role. I begin shooting for it at the end of the month,” says the young actress.
Having seen the original, Latha is quite kicked about the fact that much of the film, in which she is paired with Diganth, revolves around her character. “I need to see the film again with subtitles to really understand it. But the role of Tessa is one that fetched Parvathy quite a few awards, so I am quite excited about giving it my own spin. The director, though, is keen that I sport the same free-spirited look, including the big nose studs, glasses, short curly hair, etc. That is going to be a lot of work for me,” says the actress, laughing.
