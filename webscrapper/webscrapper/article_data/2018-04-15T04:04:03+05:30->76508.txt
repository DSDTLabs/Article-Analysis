MUMBAI: More than 5,600   applicants have scrapped their trips this year and rise in the travel cost after abolition of Haj subsidy is among the reasons for the cancellations. 

 Out of India's Haj quota of 1,75, 000, around 1, 28,000 will travel through   while 47,000 through Private Tour Operators (PTOs). 
 
 Out of the 5,617 pilgrims who have aborted their plans, 594 are from the state. The vacated seats have been allotted to waitlisted candidates. Though the pilgrims have not cited the reasons for cancelling the plans, Haj Committee's CEO Dr M A Khan admitted rise in the travel cost after the government withdrew subsidy could be a reason. "Pilgrims can withdraw candidature at any stage of the pilgrimage and we never ask for reason. Rise in travel cost could be a reason," said Khan. Till last the Haj travel was subsidized, but after the government announced end of Haj subsidy in January this year.
