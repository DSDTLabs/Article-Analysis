NEW DELHI: In a major setback for   promoter  , the Delhi high court on Thursday withdrew the interim protection from arrest and other coercive action it had granted him in April last year in connection with a 2016 FIR, lodged by the owner of one of its retail franchisees. 

 
 The order by Justice   came after the police told the court that Choksi was not cooperating with the investigation as he was not available at any of the addresses given on his behalf. 
 
 Also, the Enforcement Directorate has raised doubts over the genuineness of the person authorised by Gitanjali Gems to file its reply in the   fraud case. 
 
 During a hearing before a bench of Justices S Muralidhar and I S Mehta, ED’s counsel Amit Mahajan alleged that Gitanjali Gems paid money to Dipak Dalavi to sign the affidavit as the company’s authorised signatory and that he remains unaware of the veracity of the contents of the document.
