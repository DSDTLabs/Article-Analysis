Jacobinte Swargarajyam actor Ashwin Kumar, who is currently basking in the success of his Tamil film Dhruvangal Pathinaaru (D16), has bagged yet another plum project – Prithviraj-starrer Detroit Crossing. 

 Ashwin is all excited about joining the team for the action-thriller, which will be extensively shot in the US. However, he says he can’t say much about his role, as it might reveal the plot.
 
 “It is an interesting role. The film is about Tamil gangs in Detroit, which is why Tamil actor Sampath and I were roped in. There is a lot of Tamil influence in the film. I’m glad I’m getting to act with big league actors right at the beginning of my career,” says Ashwin, who made his acting debut in Nivin Pauly’s Jacobinte Swargarajyam.
 
 The film’s director Nirmal Sahadev spotted him in D16, which is how he got in, Ashwin says. “We had common friends and I got to know that Nirmal was interested in casting me. Once he got in touch with me, we felt like we had known each other for years! There is a strong positive vibe about him.”
  Ashwin has another huge Tamil project coming up, which he will announce later, he says. Right now, he is working on Neeraj Madhav-starrer Lavakusa.
