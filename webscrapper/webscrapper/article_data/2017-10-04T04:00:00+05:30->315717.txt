Vadodara: Former India player Jacob Martin found himself embroiled in yet another controversy after he made a comment on disabled cricket tournament held in the city some days ago. 

 Martin had posted a comment on a video posted on a social networking site. His comment wasn’t taken kindly by the officials of Baroda Disabled Cricket Association (BDCA) who lodged complaint with the district collector on Tuesday. 
 
 “Martin had commented “It’s all joker wirking’ on a video I had posted of the disabled cricket tournament. How can Martin humiliate disabled cricketers like this? He has played cricket for India so he should have been more encouraging for the disabled players,” said Nitendra Singh, coach of Indian Disabled Cricket Team. 
 
 “When entire country including PM Narendra Modi is supporting the disabled people, Martin made such comment about the disabled sportspersons is not in good taste at all,” Singh told TOI. 
 
 “I got calls from so many people from different countries after they read his comment. I had a word with Martin and he apologized for his mistake,” he added.
 
 When contacted, Martin claimed he had made the comment by mistake. 
 
 “I was talking to several persons simultaneously. I wrote it for some other person’s chat but by mistake posted it on the disabled cricket tournament’s video. There is even spelling mistake in the comment. But I have already apologized for my mistake. I can never make fun of disabled sportspersons,” Martin said.
