 Jaimin Parekh, brother-in-law of Ritesh Modi, said that the family was waiting for the DGCA’s investigation report before deciding on whether or not to seek a legal recourse. “The aviation company that operated the joyride has got in touch with us only once so far. They told us that any compensation issues would be looked into only after the DGCA report is finalised,” he said.
 
 Parekh said that the elderly parents of the deceased couple are yet to come to terms with their loss. “Ritesh and Brinda’s two-and-a-half-year-old son has resumed going to his playschool. He is being taken care of by his grandparents and other relatives. He is very close to his grandparents since they took care of him when his parents used to be away at work,” said Jaimin. With the couple’s death, the family has also lost their two earning members. “Life has to go on. As the reality sinks in, we will also start looking at all these aspects,” the brother-in-law said. 
 
 Ritesh had planned a surprise joyride for his wife of six years Brinda. Their joyride ended within minutes as the chopper crashed in Aarey Colony, Goregaon.
