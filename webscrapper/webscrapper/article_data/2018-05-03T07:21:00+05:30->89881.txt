Chandigarh: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and the leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Wednesday accused chief minister Amarinder Singh of “acting at the behest” of BJP in “tinkering with” the chapters on Sikh Gurus in the history book.

 A controversy had erupted over the history book of Class 12 with opposition parties, including the Akali Dal and AAP accusing the state government of deleting the history of Sikh Gurus from the history book of class 12.
 
 Addressing a press conference, Khaira charged Amarinder with not uttering a single word against the saffron party and alleged that he was playing BJP’s game. “There is a hidden agenda behind the changes and it seems the CM is playing BJP’s game. Have you ever heard a single word from Amarinder against BJP,” he asked.
 
 “I suggest that for the current academic session status quo be maintained, a committee of Punjab educationists be formed to realign or refresh history subject at senior secondary level. Two lakh students of Class XI will now be deprived of Punjab history when they study in Class XII now, if at all history had to be realigned it should have been done in phased manner,’ he claimed.
 
 “During Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to Amritsar, Amarinder did what Delhi said. He sought from Trudeau nine names (of Canada-based operatives allegedly involved in promoting radicalism). It was BJP’s agenda, not Amarinder’s…Amarinder is playing the game of BJP,” he alleged.
 
 Khaira went on to allege that state police administration was also run by Delhi.
