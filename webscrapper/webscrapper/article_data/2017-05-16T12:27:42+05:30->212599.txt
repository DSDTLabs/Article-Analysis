RANCHI: Former Maoist   has plans to   and 'work for the masses'. 

 Talking to the media after his surrender on Sunday, Pahan said he regretted wasting 20 years of his life and is now ready to work with the government for the upliftment of the people. "It is not that I want leadership. I want to work for the masses and expect the government to give me a chance to do the same," he said.
 
 "As a leader I am responsible for whatever incidents occurred during that period. I feel guilty for doing all the wrong activities," Pahan added. The former rebel also categorically denied his role in the murder of JD(U) MLA Ramesh Singh Munda for any personal animosity. 
 
 When asked if he enjoyed the patronage of any political party, which helped him evade police even after being disassociated with the Maoist outfit, Pahan said villagers have always been his supporters. "The police was never able to arrest me. Even the photograph that was released by them was not mine," he said. 
 
 Pahan is not the first Maoist from the state to plan his career in politics. Earlier, Kameshwar Baitha, a known rebel leader from Palamu, not only contested but also won the parliamentary elections in 2009. Another   and member of  , Paulus Surin, won the assembly election from Torpa constituency. 
 
 Meanwhile, Tamar AJSU MLA Vikas Singh Munda (and Ramesh's son) staged a dharna near Gandhi statue at Morhabadi, to protest the red carpet welcome meted out to the former Maoist by state police. 
 
 "The government should show no mercy as far as dealing with such cases are concerned," he said.
