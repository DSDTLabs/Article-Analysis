DHARAMSHALA: Three sailors from Kangra district in Himachal Pradesh, who were released by Nigerian pirates on Wednesday, are expected to reach home on Sunday. Ship captain Sushil Kumar (37),   (36) and Pankaj (37) were kidnapped and their ship hijacked by pirates on January 30 this year. Their families came to know about it on March 12, when Sushil called them through a satellite phone.

 In a statement issued here on Friday, deputy commissioner   said the three released men would be flying from Abuja, Nigeria, and reach New Delhi around 3.15pm on Saturday.
 
 “As they were coming after months of captivity, arrangements have been made for their stay at Himachal Bhawan in Delhi,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the sailors’ families have already left for Delhi. 
 
 Sushil is a resident of Nagrota Surian and has been working in merchant navy for the last 13 years. He joined Max Marine Services in Cortnou Benin on November 26 last year and the ship was owned by Nesto. After his family came to know about the kidnapping, they had got in touch with the ship owner to enquire about his welfare. However, the family alleged they were misguided by Nesto and told all crew members were safe.
 
 Pankaj hails from Samloti and Ajay from Palampur, both in Kangra district.
