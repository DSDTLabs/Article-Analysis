Bhopal: Under the GST regime fuel prices in states like MP -where the cost of fuel is maximum in the country because of local taxes- will come down. General manager Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) Vigyan Kumar said besides retailers, oil companies have talked to the governments from time to time to reduce the taxes on fuel.

 Talking to TOI while participating in a programme to launch the BS IV fuels in Bhopal- as a part of countrywide launching on Saturday morning- Kumar said, it is expected that GST is likely to reduce the fuel prices.
 
 He said Madhya Pradesh has levied the maximum tax on fuel making it the costliest. He said petroleum companies have not been able to pacify the governments that reduction of tax will lead to increase in volume of the fuel sales.
 
 Ajay Singh president of the Bhopal Multipurpose Petro Dealers Association said, “Petrol and diesel should be included in the GST ambit to bring down its prices in states like MP. However, the state government has been opposing this as it would affect its revenue.”
 
 Besides Vigyan Kumar, K Srinivas, GM HPCL and Pushp Nayar state head retail MPCG BPCL were among others who participated in the programme.
 
 “It is a fuel with low sulphur content of 50 ppm that is equal to Euro IV norms”, said Srinivas. It will help reduce the emission level and help in meeting the highest emission standards, he said.
 
 In fact, this is a step forward towards meeting the international best practices with implementation of BS VI from April 2020”, he said.
 
 The fuel will be available at all the outlets of Bhopal and the cost of the new fuel will be the same.
