Panaji: The state government has finalised a plot of 320 acres to house the permanent campus of the   (IIT), Goa. The plot falls partly in   in Sanguem taluka and partly in Nagvem, Quepem. Sources told TOI that the state government has forwarded the file to the Union ministry of human resource development (HRD) for its approval. 

 Sources in the state government said that nearly the entire plot, barring a few stray patches, is already in the possession of the state government, and the process of handing it over to IIT is expected to be completed within three months. 
 
 Some of the land is hilly, and IIT is expected to get around 240 acres of built-up space to contruct its buildings. Sources said that since the land available is limited, IIT will be expected to rent out premises from local residents for its faculty members and other such uses. This arrangement is set to help resolve the issue of land availability, provide revenue to locals, and also promote integration of the IIT with the local population. 
 
 Sources said that IIT is considering a cap on the maximum capacity to which it will expand operations. The institute wants to develop its campus into a green, environmentally-sustainable one, and not put undue pressure on the local ecology or resources. 
 
 Officials said that IIT is also identifying areas of concern like garbage management and water issues, so that its faculty and students work to provide scientific solutions to the stateâ€™s problems. 
 
 IIT-Goa began operations from July 2016 and the institute is currently functioning from its temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College, Farmagudi.
 
 Sources said that once the land for the permanent campus is handed over to the IIT, the state government will begin work on providing a four-lane access road to the plot.
