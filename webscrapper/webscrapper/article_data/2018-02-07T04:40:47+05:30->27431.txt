MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court recently rejected the   plea of the 53-year-old lawyer booked on charges of marrying a 14-year-old girl and sexually assaulting her. The court held that inspite of having knowledge of law, the accused committed the acts. 

 Refusing to grant him relief, the court said that the medical history and the statement of the teenager recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code corroborated with the FIR.
 
 The   was arrested after the minor, now 17 years old, filed a complaint on December 13, 2017. The accused, also a father to a 15-year-old girl, was booked along with the girl’s grandparents who had allegedly forced her into the marriage. The accused married the minor in 2015 after the death of his first wife in 2014. 
 
 Police said the grandmother convinced the girl, whose mother was ailing, to marry the lawyer saying there would no one look after her after their death. Police alleged that the lawyer transferred a six-acre land in their village in the girl’s name in lieu of the marriage. But after marriage, he began to suspect her “character” and allegedly physically abused her and confined her to the house.
 
 The accused, in his plea, claimed he was falsely implicated in the case and the girl was his “legally wedded wife”. He also claimed that from the school leaving certificate it was understood that she was 17 years and six months old and hence provisions of the   were not applicable to her.
 
 But the prosecution opposed the bail plea. The court said if the accused is released on bail there are chances of him tampering with the evidence. “Considering the serious nature of offence and the stage of investigation, the custody of the accused is necessary,” the court said.
