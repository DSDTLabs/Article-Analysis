 10 contestant,   shocked everyone last night when he threw his pee on   and   during the captaincy task. All the housemates for the first time stood together and locked Swami inside the jail. Bigg Boss, who had been ignoring Swami's bizzare antics, this time acted strict and eliminated him from the show. However, going by Swami Om's past record and his nature, we all knew that it would be difficult for Bigg Boss to implement the decision. And our guess was right.

 
 
 
 
 According to reports in the media, the self-proclaimed Godman simply refused to leave the house even after various announcements made by Bigg Boss. Even after repeated calls when Swami Om stood firm on his decision of not leaving the house, security force was called inside the house to drag him out of the reality series.
 
 It would be interesting to see how host   reacts on the entire controversy.
