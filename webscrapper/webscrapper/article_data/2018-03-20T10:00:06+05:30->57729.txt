HYDERABAD : There has been no water supply since four days in  , thanks to shoddy repair work carried out by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Around 20 families in the area are the worst affected.

 While the civic body was widening a stormwater drain in the area, a water pipeline got damaged. The   has fixed the water line of three houses, but the remaining households are still suffering. These families have demanded restoration of water supply immediately. Locals say their repeated requests to the contractor to fix the problem has fallen on deaf years.
 
 
 “After water supply was stopped, we remained calm for two days after which we contacted the contractor, but in vain. He assured us that he will send a plumber and fix the issue. He said the damaged pipes have been identified, but now is not lifting our call,” said  , a resident of Edi Bazar. Habeeb said the lack of water has forced him to lock his house and stay at his son’s place.
 
 Locals also complained that once dug up, roads in the area are not covered again because of which commuting is a nightmare. Some people even claimed that they are unable to remove vehicles from their homes.
 
 “Due to the road being dug up, the stretch is hardly of any use and we are taking alternate routes. We are unable take our vehicles out of our homes and are forced to use public transport,” said   A, a resident of that area.
