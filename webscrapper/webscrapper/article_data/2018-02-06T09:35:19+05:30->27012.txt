 Every marriage ritual was done, however, some of them were cut short keeping in mind the health condition of the  , residents of New Barrackpore (North 24 Pgns).
 
 "This is my parent's 50th marriage anniversary. A grand celebration was due. So we decided to recreate the auspicious occasion. They should relive the moment," said Nath.
