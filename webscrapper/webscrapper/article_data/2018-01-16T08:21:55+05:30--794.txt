AHMEDABAD: Companies in Israel and   are likely to form business-to-business (B2B) collaborations to develop a sound technological platform for various sectors. At least this was the stated aim at the recent seminar by Israel-based firms at the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( ). Presentations were made by them before industry stakeholders, pitching technology-backed businesses in various arenas to Indian and Gujarat-based counterparts.

 The focus was on technology collaboration in sectors such as medical and assistive devices, fire fighting technology for industrial units, port security and security training, smart city projects, waste water treatment and cyber security.
 
 Skornik Tal, managing director of Skornik Tal Ltd, who was at one of the sessions said, “We’re looking at setting up an academy for security training somewhere around Gujarat and look forward to support from the government.”
 
 Shailesh Patwari, president of GCCI, said, “There is tremendous scope for B2B collaboration with counterparts in Israel, especially on the technology front. Possibilities for a joint venture with an Indian firm for manufacturing medical and assistive devices are being explored.”
 
 Industry experts believe that major technology exchange is possible for cotton farming. “Gujarat is the biggest cotton producing state in India, despite this, we produce only 575kg per hectare. Yield and quality can be improved significantly with Israeli technology,” Patwari added.
 
 Industry experts also emphasized on collaboration possibilities in defence. GCCI recently signed an MoU with  , for defence-related research for micro small and medium entreprises (MSMEs). “Collaboration on the defence front can always be explored for MSMEs in the state and the team at GU will also explore R&D opportunities,” said a GCCI official.
