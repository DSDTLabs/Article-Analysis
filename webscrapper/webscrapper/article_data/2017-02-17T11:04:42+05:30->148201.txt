Kareena is announced as the new Guru Maa due to Soumya's vote in her favour. When the ceremony is complete, Soumya seeks permission to leave. But just then Kareena betrays her trust by ordering her followers to put her in the cellar. 

 Both Mallika and Soumya are shocked on hearing this. Kareena's followers catch hold of Soumya but true to her words, Mallika comes to her rescue. With a rod in her hand, she asks Soumya to run and beats up the kinnar women.
 
  
 Kalsi comes to Maninder's house. She looks at Maninder and is about to leave. However, Maninder stops her from going. He apologizes to her and asks her to talk to the prospective groom's family about Surbhi again. This leaves both Bebe and Nani worried. 
 
 Harak Singh stops Soumya while she is on her way. Just as they had told Harman, both pretend to be coming back together from the temple. 
 
 Old Guru Maa tells Mallika what she did was wrong. Mallika stands firm on her ground though and explains to her what she feels. Guru Maa leaves and Saya drops her. When she comes back, Kareena asks her to stay outside the house and tells her to find a new abode.
