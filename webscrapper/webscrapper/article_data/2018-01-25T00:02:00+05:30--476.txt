Pune: The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) — the nodal agency to manage the operations of the proposed Purandar airport — is all set to start the techno-economic feasibility study.

 MADC vice-chairman and managing director Suresh Kakani told TOI that the techno-economic feasibility study would determine if the proposed airport should have both the runways constructed at the same time or they could done in phases. The study is expected to be completed in two months.
 
 “We need to decide whether both the runways of the airport should be constructed at the same time or we can add the second runway in the second phase of the project. We need to first see the passenger load factor. It will not be feasible if we go for both the runways at the same time and then see that there are not enough passengers and it remains under-utilized,” he said.
 
 On the cost factor of the airport, Kakani said it would come to the fore in the same study. “In simple words, the study can be said to be the detailed project report (DPR) of the airport,” he said.
 
 On the present site and the ministry of defence letter, Kakani said only minor changes were required in the location of the proposed airport. “It might be shifted a bit towards the south,” he said.
 
 “The letter has specifically stated that once the airport is ready, all the civilian scheduled and non-scheduled flights operating from the Lohegaon facility at present will be operating from the new airport. The Lohegaon airport is a defence facility under the Indian Air Force (IAF) and operating civil flights was a stopgap arrangement only,” Kakani said.
