GUMLA: The alleged suicide of a 60-year-old farmer in   of Gumla district does not appear to be a case of due to the loan, police said on Tuesday. 

 A team comprising of   (AC) Alok Shikari Kacchap, director of   (NEP) Nayantara and   (BDO) Vijay Kumar Soni visited the deceased's family and initiated a probe into the alleged suicide case. "Poverty does not appear to be the reason behind the farmer's death. He had Rs 33,111 in his bank account and more than Rs 3,060 in another account of a farmer's group which he headed," Soni said. 
 
 The body of Birsai Oraon was found hanging from a tree, some distance away from his house, on Monday. The farmer's wife Sukarmani alleged that Oraon left the house without informing anybody and did not return. 
 
 Sukarmani also claimed that last year, he was forced to sell his oxen when there wasn't any good harvest due to poor rain. "He wanted to buy oxen to cultivate his fields this season. But since their prices were high, he was unable to buy them," she said.
 
 However, the BDO refuted the claims and said the farmer was aged and would not have been able to drive the oxen. "He wanted to buy a tractor instead," Soni said. He added that a possible fight over the mode of cultivation with his wife may also have led the farmer to commit suicide.
