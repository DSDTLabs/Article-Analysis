The state government will issue the consent letter for alignment as soon as NHAI requests us and provide maps,” said Anil Garg, chief engineer (NH).
 
 PWD minister Yunus Khan also maintained that the Rajasthan government would approve the alignment and complete land acquisition in 12 to 18 months.
 
 NHAI officials from Gurgaon said initial inspection was being carried out in Rajasthan as some issues have emerged during previous inspections at Alwar district. “Once completed, the state government will be asked to start the acquisition process while the NHAI will fix the alignment,” officials said.
 
 The expressway will pass through 423 villages in seven districts — Gurgaon, Jhajjar, Rewari, Mahendergarh, Alwar, Sikar and Jaipur. Out of the 1,755 hectares that need to be acquired, 360.65 hectares belong to the government, 1.22 hectares are part of the reserve forest area and 38 hectares ‘protected forest’ land in Haryana and Rajasthan.
 
 Officials said the expressway would reduce the Gurgaon-Jaipur trip to 120 minutes. At present, it takes anywhere between four to five hours, or even more if the traffic is heavy.
