Bhushan Kumar, one of the leading producers in the industry today, believes that times are such that people either want to see content-driven films which are grounded in reality or go to the theatres to watch epic fantasy films. He says, “Today people either want to see meaningful cinema or are demanding a film like ‘Baahubali’. With the latter, the audience knows that willing suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite. In such a film, the protagonist fighting a thousand adversaries alone and emerging victorious without a scratch is palatable because of the superb quality of production and visuals. On the other hand, mere star-driven films fail to earn box-office revenue." 

  That's not all, he also adds that as a producer, one should have control over a film's budget if it’s a content-driven film and not go overboard. He says, "I am a passionate filmmaker, but at the same time, I’m also extremely conscious about ensuring that my films are budgeted smartly. I don’t believe in pumping in any amount just to fulfil my passion. Producers who don’t keep a check on their budget end up losing money. We put in our own money, we don’t borrow from anyone. I earn from my music business and use it to produce films. Actors in the industry now insist that a movie’s budget shouldn’t be on the higher end of the spectrum, and often reduce their remuneration to help make the film a profitable venture."
