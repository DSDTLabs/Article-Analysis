CHENNAI: Emphasising the   for   in the US and vice-versa,   (UCB) chairman Professor Nicholas B Dirks projected growth in several tech realms where Indians can have an impact.

 “Subjects like machine learning, automation and artificial intelligence are coming up like never before. Indians already have left a large footprint in the tech eco-system of the US and have lots to contribute in these areas as well,“ he said.
 
 Though professional postgraduate and under graduate programmes are big picks for Indian students going to the US, he stated that research will be the frontline of knowledge in the coming years.
 
 “There will be great cooperation between SRM University and UCB in the future,“ he said emphasising the point, while speaking at a special convocation hosted by the university at its Katankulathur campus on Monday.
 
 Adding that India had also expanded in terms of research opportunities, he projected more funding and brain-drain into disciplines like biosciences and medical sciences that are gaining more ground in the country.
