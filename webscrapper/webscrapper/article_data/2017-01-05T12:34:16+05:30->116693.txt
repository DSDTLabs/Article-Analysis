NEW DELHI: Even as the Indian cricket board comes to terms with the implementation of  , the five selectors will be confronting uneasy times as they sit down on January 6 to pick the   and T20I teams for the home series against England.  , as has been the case before a limited-overs series for the last one year, will again be the central point of discussion.

 The selectors will also be selecting the India ‘A’ team which is slated to play the tourists in two one-day warm-up matches at the   in Mumbai on January 10 and 12. The catch is if Dhoni, who has had very little game time since the ODI series against   in October, is going to feature in the warm-up matches. It is expected that the selectors will be spending a lot of time of their meeting discussing Dhoni.
 
 The selectors and the board have boasted of having developed a system which has graduated players to senior team through India ‘A’ and India Under-19s. The selectors could find themselves in a fix is if they wish to stick to their stand and go in with a wicketkeeper from the domestic circuit for the warm-up matches. TOI has understood, managing and tracking Dhoni’s form has become a tricky issue. “It is certainly a major point of deliberation. These are the only three ODIs left before the   in June. The warm-up matches are as important now,” a source close to the selectors told TOI.
 
 However, chairman of selectors   acknowledged Dhoni’s contribution to Indian cricket moments after he decided to step down from captaincy. “Dhoni has been a fantastic leader and a servant of Indian cricket. We respect his decision. He still has a lot to offer as a player and has communicated his thoughts to me,” Prasad told TOI on Wednesday night.
