Trichy: District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) launched an inquiry into the incident in which a 12-year-old boy’s eyesight was severely affected after he was exposed to the toxic fumes of toilet cleaning acid at Blessing Children Home in Iluppaiyur in Trichy district on Thursday.

 Official sources said that the boy was allegedly assigned to clean the toilet using an acid at the home on Tuesday night. The Class VII boy reportedly told officials that the container filled with acid slipped from his hand and caused fumes.
 
 His left eye was exposed to the fumes. The boy had severe irritation, swelling and blurred vision and sought immediate treatment. Sources said that the home administration took him to a private hospital in the city on Wednesday, but he had no cure. His elder brother also stays at the same home.
 
 The boy’s poor widow mother brought the boy to Pulivalam police station on Wednesday night. The police forwarded the issue to Childline and later to DCPU, following which the boy was admitted at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) for treatment on Thursday.
 
 Hospital sources confirmed that the fumes had caused some severe damage to the cornea of the eye. The doctors said that the fumes could even cause vision loss. However, the complete status of the boy’s eyes was yet to be evaluated as he was still undergoing treatment. His mother lodged a complaint with the child welfare committee (CWC) too, accusing the home administration of misusing her son to clean the toilet. DCPU’s M Geetha and her team visited the boy at MGMGH on Thursday recorded his statements. “We are awaiting the report from the DCPU for initiating action in the matter,” said chairperson of CWC S Indira Gandhi on Friday. The home is likely to face the action for violation.
