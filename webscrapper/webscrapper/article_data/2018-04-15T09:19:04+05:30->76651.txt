BENGALURU: Wooing college girls at a bus stop is perhaps the oldest trick at hand for a love-struck boy. But when a BMTC bus came on time and whisked away the waiting girls on the  , two furious boys assaulted the bus crew on Friday and promptly landed in police custody.

 Lalitkumar Yadav, 21, and M Shubhambalani, 21, were reportedly upset with the BMTC driver and conductor for arriving on time at the bus stop and the girls leaving. The boys from Gujarat stay in an apartment in Byagadadenahalli on the outskirts of the city. They were booked under Sections 352 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and sent to   ( ).
 
 A police officer said: “There has been friction between students of a nearby college and BMTC staff for some time. While the boys were angry with BMTC staff for abruptly curtailing their chat-time with collegemates, BMTC drivers were irked by the boys’ bad behaviour. The drivers allege that boys would park their bikes haphazardly at the bus stop and mock them.”
 
 On Thursday afternoon, the boys decided to impress the girls by sticking their legs out to stop the bus. When driver Gururaj and conductor   objected to it, the students assaulted them. On seeing a crowd gathering, the two escaped after abandoning their bike. In the melee, one of them dropped his bag and fled.
 
 The BMTC staff went to Anekal police station, handed over the bag and lodged a complaint.
 
 The cops seized the bike and, based on the identity card found in the bag, arrested the students from their apartment. The police are on the lookout for an autorickshaw driver who had joined the students in the assault.
 
 The police, quoting locals, told STOI: “It’s common for bike-borne boys to persuade girls at the bus-stop to come with them for a ride instead of boarding the bus. The boys were disappointed when the bus comes on time.”
