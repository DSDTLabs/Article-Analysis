MOHALI:   may get paid parking in the next few days as the agenda will come up for discussion in the municipal corporation (MC) house meeting slated next week. 

 Councillors, who had opposing paid parking till date, surprisingly agreed to the proposal submitted by mayor  .
 
 Councillors said chaotic parking lots in Mohali markets have forced residents to head to Chandigarh, where they find proper parking space. "Every other day, minor brawls are witnessed in markets due to haphazard parking," said Kamaljit  , a councillor.
 
 Ruby said, "We need paid parking as managing vehicles in parking lots has become impossible. We need to re-introduce the concept. Also, the civic body will generate revenue from paid parking."
 
 Kulwant Singh said, "It is the need of the hour. Markets have become non-manageable due to wrong and haphazard parking, leading to scuffles. Many traders have also come up with complaints that visitors are shifting to Chandigarh as they do not find proper parking space in Mohali markets."
 
 The mayor hinted that the first hour of parking would be free and parking fee would subsequently be on hourly basis.
 
 Gurjeet Singh, one of the traders in Phase V market, said, "The parking always remains congested. We tend to lose customers as due to no parking space, people go to Chandigarh."
 
 In March 2014, paid parking was introduced in Mohali but was stopped after protests erupted. The fee for two-wheelers was Rs 2 and four-wheelers Rs 5 then.
