MUMBAI: The state government will   for the   after the   was way above the estimates.Three companies submitted bids the first time -Reliance Infrastructure, Afcons Infrastructure and L&T which bid the lowest.

 Reliance Infrastructure lost in the technical round while Afcons bid close to Rs4,779 crore and L&T bids were close to Rs3,826 crore.The government's estimate for the first phase of the project was Rs 2,500 crore. The lowest bidder is 53% higher that the estimate. According to norms, bids can be finalized and tenders can be allotted only if bids are up to 10% higher than estimates.
 
 Chairman of the Shivaji Memorial Project, Vinayak Mete, said, “We have asked the public works department to examine if there were problems with our estimates in the first place and seek an ex planation from the company as to why its bids are this high. If this situation prevails, we will have to re-tender.“
 
 TOIwas the first to report that the bids were higher than estimates. The first phase bids were higher than the government's estimate for the entire project. The government's estimate for the entire project, phase 1 and phase 2, was Rs 3,600 crore. A bronze statue of Shivaji along with museums, auditorium and a 10-bed hospital are part of the first phase.
 
 Officials said that negotiations may not work as there is a yawning gap between estimates and the bid. “How much can you negotiate?“ said an official from Mantralaya. “If it were a small difference, it would have been possible to negotiate.“
 
 Re-tendering could push the project's commencement by at least three months. The state government aimed to start the project in June.
