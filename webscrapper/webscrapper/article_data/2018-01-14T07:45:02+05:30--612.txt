CHANDIGARH: A half-naked body of a teenaged girl, suspected to have been murdered, was found from the bank of a water channel passing through   village under   subdivision of   district late on Friday. 

 Acting on a complaint of sarpanch  , police have started investigations after registration of a murder case. Jind SP   Nehra constituted a special investigation team (SIT) headed by DSP Kaptan Singh to probe the matter. 
 
 Police have not ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse of the girl. Cops associated with investigations said the body was wet and the victim might have been murdered somewhere else.
 
 "We have shifted the body to the PGIMS, Rohtak, for a postmortem examination. The medical board has been asked to examine the victim for sexual abuse. So far as the incident is concerned, we have already registered a murder case. Prima facie it appears either the victim was murdered somewhere and body was abandoned here. A second theory can be that the body had come with the flow of the water in the channel," said SP Nehra. He said the crime experts had inspected the area and there was no mark of struggle where the body was found. He also did not rule out if the victim was subjected to sexual abuse before murder. "Let the postmortem report come," the SP said.
 
 According to information, during late evening hours on Friday, body of the victim, who appeared to be 15-16 years of age, was spotted by residents of Budha Khera. With injury marks over the face and head, the body was lying on its back.
 
 "Soon after reacting the spot, we covered the body with a cloth. A message was flashed across the state. As nobody turned up till Saturday morning, we sent the body to the PGIMS, Rohtak," said inspector   of Safidon police station.
