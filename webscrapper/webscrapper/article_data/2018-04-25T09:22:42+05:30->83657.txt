BENGALURU: A local court directed   police to register a case against a 37-year-old software engineer for allegedly sexually abusing his minor daughter. The girl’s mother approached the court last week, claiming her six-year-old daughter was being abused by the father. A case was filed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

They divorced and the father got custody of the elder daughter. “For the first couple of years, we worked in different cities before settling down in Sweden,” the mother told police. “We returned to Bengaluru from Sweden in 2016. My   was born in Sweden while the younger one, who is a year old now, was born in Bengaluru.”

As directed by the Swedish court, my elder daughter lives with my husband,” she said.

An officer said they can proceed with the case only after getting a statement from the victim. “Women police officers will talk to the minor as well as her mother,” he said.
 
 After registering the FIR, a posse of police officers went to Koramangala looking for the father, but he remained incommunicado and his  .
