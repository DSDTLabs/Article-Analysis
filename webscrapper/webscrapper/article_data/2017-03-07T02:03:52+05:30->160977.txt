NEW DELHI: AAP’s Bijwasan MLA, Colonel Devinder   (retd) has moved court against his party on the basis of media reports suggesting his expulsion, both from the party and the assembly. He has also written to the speaker, asking him not to entertain any expulsion proceeding as the matter is now sub-judice.

 In his petition, Sehrawat claimed that there was an imminent threat of his expulsion and that he had been “completely boycotted and sidelined” by the party. Last month,   had said that “concerned” Delhiites were likely to formally complain against Sehrawat to the speaker, as they had voted for AAP but the MLA was acting against the party and had therefore let down the electorate. A speaker could decide to hold proceedings under anti-defection laws enshrined in the 10th Schedule of the Constitution if such a complaint is made. 
 
 Sehrawat was expelled from the party last year after he had levelled certain allegations against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in the party. Earlier, he had supported   and Prashant Bhushan when they were expelled in 2015. More recently, he had campaigned against AAP and Punjab in the assembly elections there. 
 
 There have also been allegations about Sehrawat putting up posters across the city against the CM. He, however, couldn’t be contacted for a reaction despite many attempts.
