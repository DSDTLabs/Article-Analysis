NEW DELHI: A   student lost hearing in his right ear after his mathematics teacher allegedly slapped him. The child has been at home for the last few weeks undergoing treatment for his ear. His parents alleged that the child was also beaten by another teacher last year when his collarbone got fractured.

 According to Aruna Jain, Kubershree Jain’s mother, the child was beaten during his maths class when the teacher asked a child a question but   raised his hand. “She told Kuber he already know the answer and hit him,” alleged Aruna. The parents said that the whole matter was recorded on CCTV cameras, which helped police frame a case.
 
 “Now, liquid drains out of Kubershree’s ear as his ear bone is infected. He is undergoing treatment and a surgery will be conducted after three months. But he has lost hearing in the right ear,” said Aruna. Kubershree has been running a high fever because of the infection and missing school since December 22, when the incident happened.
 
 She claimed that the school management has been very uncooperative in the matter and the parents have been pressured to keep the matter under wraps.
 
 Jain said that her son was also injured last year in   in east Delhi, after a teacher pushed him for not standing in line during a function practice in the ground. She added that Kubershree fractured his collarbone.
 
 “The school has been very uncooperative. We don’t send our children to school so they can get beaten up. I want to drag the management to court and only then shift my son to another school,” she said.
 
 The principal of the school,  , said the teacher who had slapped the child has been suspended. “We have initiated internal inquiry and until then the teacher has been suspended,” he said. DCP (Shahdara)   said that a case has been registered based on the complaint by the family members.
