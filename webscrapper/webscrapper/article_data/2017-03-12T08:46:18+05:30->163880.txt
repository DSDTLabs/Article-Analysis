LUCKNOW: Seen as a fortified stronghold of Samajwadi Party’s first family, the Yadavland comprising Kannauj, Etah, Mainpuri and   stood by the party founder   Singh Yadav for almost three decades. The region identified as the pocket borough of SP, stood by Mulayam, braving the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and secured four of the total five seats that SP won. But the 2017 assembly polls have thrown up a totally different picture with SP losing nine of the total of 14 assembly seats in the four districts it had swept in 2012 assembly elections.

 Apart from   Yadav’s   assembly seat which covers the Yadav clan’s native village of Saifai, the SP managed to retain only Kannauj (central), Mainpuri (Sadar), Kisni and Karhal. Despite being a predominantly Yadav belt, rest of the seats went to BJP.
 
 Though senior SP leaders claim that a combination of a host of different factors have contributed to SP’s route in its stronghold, they admit that the recent family feud in which party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his younger brother Shivpal Yadav were sidelined, had played an important role in the election results from the region. “The manner in which Akhilesh had humiliated and dethroned his father (Mulayam) and uncle (Shivpal) left the elderlies upset to the extent that they did not vote for the SP,” said a senior party leader, adding: “In most of the places, they opted for the BJP.”
 
 The statement finds an echo in the election results as per which all nine seats SP lost went to the BJP. The BSP, which had earlier stood second in almost half a dozen seats during the 2012 elections, was pushed to the third place in all the constituencies except for Chhibramau in Kannauj where BSP’s Tahir Siddiqui managed but only to retain his runners-up position of 2012.
