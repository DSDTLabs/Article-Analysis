CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister   on Sunday asked the opposition parties to exercise restraint and not to hold any agitation over the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue. "I have full faith in the   and the state would soon get its due share of water through the SYL," he added. 

 Interacting with mediapersons here,   said the Supreme Court had given its decision in favour of Haryana. Now the execution order is to be passed by the apex court.
 
 "We have full faith in the Supreme Court and the opposition too should have faith. The Presidential reference had been lying pending in the Supreme Court for more than 10 years. It is the present state government that strongly pleaded the case in the Supreme Court and ensured regular hearing. As a result of this, the apex court has given its decision in the favour of Haryana," he added.
 
 In reply to a question, he said the opposition parties should refrain from inciting public sentiments, and instead, give constructive suggestions.
 
 When the present government had already announced that student union elections would be held in the next academic session, agitation by INLD on the issue was neither called for nor justifiable, Khattar said. Once consensus has been reached on any matter, petty politics should not be resorted to, he said, adding that   did what it said. 
 
 In reply to another question, he said that Anganwadi workers and helpers should call off their agitation in public interest. All their genuine demands would be sympathetically considered, he added.
