MUMBAI: A total 326 PhDs and M Phils will be awarded at Mumbai University’s annual   on Monday. Last year, this number stood at 301. Maximum researchers who will be awarded degrees are from science faculty (145) followed by arts (130). Though commerce comprises 46% of the 1.61 lakh students, only 21 from the faculty will get degrees.

 Chancellor of universities in the state, Ch Vidyasagar Rao, and industrialist Mukesh Ambani will be the guests at the convocation. Though chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state education minister Vinod Tawde were among the invited dignitaries, but will not be able to attend as the election code of conduct has been imposed.
 
 While the convocation event will be held at the university’s Fort campus, this year for the first time, around 4,000 students will be present at the sports complex at the Kalina campus, where the ceremony will be streamed live.
 
 The convocation certificates awarded this year will have quick response codes, a security feature that will help curb distribution of fake certificates and expedite verification of degrees. As the feature was added this year, printing of certificates was delayed, forcing the varsity to push college-level   distribution by two weeks. Colleges will hold their individual ceremonies from January 28. TNN
