JAIPUR: After using geotagging technology for   (PMAY), state government has received approval from Union ministry of rural development to use it in   (IAY) in the state. State will now re-audit all the houses contrasted under the scheme and bring it under geotagging to remove duplicity and discrepancy. 

 A letter was sent by chief secretary O P Meena requesting the ministry to provide facility of geotagging for completed houses under IAY. As per state government records, total 4.86 lakh homes were sanctioned from year 2011-12 to year 2015-16. Out of this, government managed to start construction on 2.31 lakh homes by April 2016 and completed nearly 1.10 lakh houses by September 2016 with 1.20 lakh homes still under construction.
 
 “However, there were no provisions to link constructed or under construction homes to geotag and link with AwasApp. After union ministry’s permission, this facility will be available for the state. Houses which are already completed can now be geotagged from mobile app online by uploading photographs at level call completion with toilet,” said an official. 
 
 So far only houses that were under PMAY were covered with this technology. But state government wants it for the ongoing IAY too. “Intention of the government is to link all homes with geotagging so that we can keep tab over their progress and also to ensure that it reaches to targeted beneficiary,” said an official of the department. 
 
 “Instructions have been passed to concerned officials and Government of India has approved to makes changes in AwasApp so that already constructed homes can be listed too,” added the official. Along with it, the department will also start audit and verifying process once again for all sanctioned homes.
