CHENNAI: It was tipped to be a close contest between triple jump national record holder   and 2014 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Arpinder Singh on the final day of the 57th   here at the   on Thursday.

 However, Kerala's  , with a torn shoe, stunned the two champion athletes with a leap of 16.15m en route to winning his first nationals gold medal. Services'   (16.06m) clinched silver, while Arpinder (16.06m) had to settle for bronze as Babu had a better second jump. Renjith, who hobbled his way out after his third attempt with a thigh strain, ended up fourth with a 16m jump.
 
 The toe part of Sreejithmon's left shoe split open wide after his third attempt, which saw him jump 16.15m. However, he had “no replacement shoes“ and he had no option but to keep going.
 
 Despite the odds, Sreejithmon replicated his previous show in his last attempt registering another 16.15m jump, while Arpinder, who had jumped an impressive 16.06m in his first effort, made no mark in his next five jumps.
 
 Sreejithmon said he is “not yet employed” and that he hopes some private concern offers him a job. “I was out of action for a couple of years with a back injury. I have crossed the age limit for a government offer. It's my farmer parents and Kerala Sports Council (KSC) who support me. I only get Rs 1000 per month from KSC including a kit. I don't have a replacement shoe and you saw that today,” he said.
