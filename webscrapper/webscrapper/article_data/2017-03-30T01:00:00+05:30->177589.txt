After the phenomenal success of 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Ice Age', 'Rio' and 'How To Train Your Dragon',   is back with another family entertainer — ' '. This animated flick, which features the voices of  ,  ,  , Jimmy Kimmel and others, is about the unusual Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin), who arrives at Tim Templeton’s (Tobey Maguire) home wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. The instant sibling rivalry between the two is put aside when Tim discovers that Boss Baby is a spy on a secret mission. The two then unite to help thwart a dastardly plot that involves an epic battle between puppies and babies. Touted to be this summer holiday’s biggest family entertainer, the trailer has already won hearts for its cute characters and unique storyline. Appealing to kids and parents alike, it’s currently one of the most popular videos online. 
Interestingly, on the same weekend last year, 'Kung Fu Panda 3' smashed records — it got the highest opening for an animated film in India and the interminable buzz around 'The Boss Baby', which releases in theatres tomorrow, makes it seem like this film, too, is all set to become a favourite this summer.
