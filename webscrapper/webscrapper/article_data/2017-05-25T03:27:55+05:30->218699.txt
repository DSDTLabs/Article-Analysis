GURUGRAM: In a bid to decongest the  , the highway concessionaire has decided to introduce three ‘sub-lanes’ 150 meters ahead of the existing booth on the extreme left lane of the toll plaza.

 The new lanes will become operational from 9am on Thursday. The move, officials said, is expected to offer some respite from traffic snarls at the plaza. At present, the waiting time at the toll plaza is between 15 and 30 minutes during rush hours.
 
 Currently, there are 28 lanes at   toll plaza and around 90,000 vehicles cross it on a regular weekday. The three additional split-lanes will be created on only one lane. The plan is allow a portion of cars to cross tyhe main booths and stop ahead so that the main plaza does not get as congested. 
 
 The split lanes will be opened on the Delhi-Jaipur side and will have Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) facilities. 
 
 Highway concessionaire Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) had been trying to get additional land for the toll plaza for the past year. However, that has not materialized. The split lanes have been created as an alternative plan.
 
 “The idea is to decrease waiting time at the toll plaza during heavy traffic. Also, this will help in decreasing the traveling time, and in reduce choking of vehicles and boom-lifting due to the tailback of waiting vehicles. At the same time, it will also increase revenue generation at the toll booths,” said S Raghuraman, CEO of MCEPL.
