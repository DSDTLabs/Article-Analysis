They came to vote despite all kinds of odds and challenges. But, to the dismay of the differently able, there were no facilities for them at booths. Booths in both rural and urban areas lacked facilities for the differently able. Orthopaedically challenged brother and sister duo BR Saxena (62) and Ranjana Saxena (65) had come to cast their vote in Indiranagar. 

 “We criticise governments but to be able to do that, we need to play our role and act responsibly. This is our time to choose the right person and the right government,” said Ranjana. 
 
 Sushma, a native of Sukrawan village in  , trudged 5km with the help of crutches to cast her vote for the first time. Call it Napoleonic will or passion, she has it all. However, she expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of facilities for the differently able at booths. 
 
 “The Election Commission must make some arrangement for us to vote,” she said. 
 
 “I have come to cast my vote to inspire the youth of my colony who are stuck to their smartphones and cyber world. It was tough for me as no arrangements have been made for wheelchairs. Temporary ramps should have been arranged by polling officers,” said Sarojinianar resident Ajay Kumar Sonkar.
 
 Vipin Sahu, 57, came riding his disabled-friendly rickshaw at Kalicharan Degree College in Thakurganj.
 
 “I lost my job because of this disability. Ever since I became crippled five years ago,   have told me to not walk but that does not mean I will not vote. That’s my duty,” said Sahu, whose entire family had come to vote.
 
 The left side of 65-year-old Salma Khan’s body has been paralysed for five years. She had to be carried to the polling booth in a rickshaw in Malihabad. “I voted for aman-sukoon (calm and peace). There should be no distinction based on religion,” she said.
