MUMBAI: Mumbai: Your   commute is set to get cooler. Mumbai’s suburban system will have 70 local trains with air-conditioned (AC) coaches. 

 This was announced by   on Thursday. Goyal was in the city to flag off the inaugural run of the   train services from   to Goregaon. 
 
 Each of the partially airconditioned trains will have three compartments with AC features. Goyal, who flagged off the inaugural run of the , said, “We are planning to have 70 rakes fitted with three AC coaches. Each of these will have a first class, second and a ladies coach.” 
 
 The existing 12-car rakes will have three of the ordinary coaches removed and these ordinary coaches will then be replaced with three AC compartments. The decision has been taken because the existing 12car AC train does not have much of a demand. Also, the current AC train holds up non-AC trains, thus upsetting non-AC commuters as they get delayed due to the AC train, especially during the peak hour. 
 
 A senior official of   (MRVC) said, “It will take 12-15 months to manufacture the partly AC trains.” This means these trains are likely to see the light of day after June 2019. According to the proposed plan, each 12-car fully AC local could be split into four parts.
 
 The first three coaches, including the motorman’s cabin, of the AC local can replace three coaches of an ordinary train. Similarly, the rest of the nine AC coaches will be attached to three other ordinary trains. The cost of each AC train is estimated to be Rs 60 crore.
