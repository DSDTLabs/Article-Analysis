 There will be a break of about one month in the Indian leagues next season to enable the national team prepare for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, the All India Football Federation's general secretary   said on Thursday.
 
 The national team has qualified for the 17th edition of the quadrennial event to be held in the United Arab Emirates from January 5 to February 1. “The coach (Stephen Constantine) has shared a detailed plan with us. He wants to play a few matches and also take the team on an exposure trip," said Das, who was here on the first day of the Super Cup qualifying matches. "For that to happen, we have told everyone concerned that the leagues will be halted for about a month.” The break is likely to be in December.
