CHENNAI: It is the duty of the government to protect its people from pollution, it does not matter whether such issues are brought to the notice of the government through representations, the   observed on Monday.

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice A   made the observations while hearing a PIL moved by Global Warming Environment Protecting Society seeking direction to the authorities concerned to take appropriate steps to prevent water and air pollution in the city’s slums.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, government pleader   submitted that the petitioner has failed to mention the details of the representations made on the issues to the authorities.
 
 Taking exception to the submission, the bench said it does not matter whether or not representations are made to the authorities on such issues, the government is duty bound to take action and protect the citizens from such pollution. The bench then ordered notice to the central and state governments and posted the plea to April 16 for further hearing. 
 
 According to the petitioner, air and water pollution are creating respiratory problems, particularly tuberculosis (TB), in the slum areas. “Industrial emissions and heavy vehicle emissions are the causes of air pollution and industrial wastes and human wastes which mix into water resources pollute ground water,” the petitioner said.
 
 Warning that if the environmental degradation is not restored pollution levels would result into extinction of life in India, he said, implementation of the Pollution Act by both the state and union governments is very much necessary.
