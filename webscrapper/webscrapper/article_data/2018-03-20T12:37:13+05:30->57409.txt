PANAJI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari assured   office-bearers, MPs and MLAs that the Centre along with the state government would file a review petition in the   against its February 7 judgment to suspend   activities in Goa.

 Gadkari, who was briefed on the importance of mining to the state and its dependents, will meet all stakeholders including mining companies on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
 
 BJP sources said the MLAs demanded that the Centre should bring some rule to overrule the Supreme Court judgment that quashed 88 mining leases and suspended mining operations in the state. But Gadkari rejected the demand and told the MLAs that the Centre at best could become a party to the review petition.
 
 Gadkari also discussed with them the names of the advocate who will represent the state and the Union government. The state government has already taken a decision to file a review petition for mining operations to continue till the auction of leases are carried out.
 
 Meanwhile, in a tweet, additional solicitor general Atmaram Nadkarni said that it was the “failure of control by state authorities. Absence of Manohar Parrikar felt.”
