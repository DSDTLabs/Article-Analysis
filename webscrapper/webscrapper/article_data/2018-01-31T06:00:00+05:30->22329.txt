 actor   was arrested on Monday evening following a complaint filed by his wife,   in Madhapur Police Station. The actor who played Anushka’s husband in Panchakshari was 
accused of trespassing, theft and causing damage to her property at her flat in Nectar Gardens, Madhapur. The investigating officer, Sub Inspector   said, “The accused barged into his wife’s apartment on January 20th and stole some valuable items and destroyed some of her belongings.
 
 His wife, who was out of town returned home on January 26, and found that her house had been broken into. She filed a complaint on January 26, and on the very same day we filed an FIR. The investigations revealed that he had indeed barged in, so we took him into custody”.This is not the first time Samrat has a case filed against him. He was accused of dowry harassment and attempting to murder her in December last year by his wife. A case was booked at Rajendra Nagar Police station under section 498 A and section 307 of IPC which is for cruelty against wife and attempt to murder respectively.
 
 The duo, who married in 2015, apparently haven’t been on talking terms for a long time. “It was sometime in April last year that the couple started having differences and have been living separately for a while. Their parents tried to make peace between them but to no avail. After the talks failed, Harshita filed a case, which is still under investigation,” informs Sub Inspector, K Narayana Reddy of Rajendranagar police station.
 
 The Madhapur Police has filed case under section 448, 427, 380 and 201. He has been arrested for the same as is the case with regular theft cases. This will be coupled with the section 498 A and Section 307 which were filed in Rajendranagar police station. At the time of going to press, officials informed that the accused was to be produced on Tuesday, January 30 at the Miyapur court.
