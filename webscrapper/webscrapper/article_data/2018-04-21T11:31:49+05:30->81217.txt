HYDERABAD: Visualisation maps regarding availability and accessibility to major parks prepared by city-based urban governance organisation Lakeer revealed that most of the city falls in Red category, except West and Central zones of Hyderabad. Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills and Vanasthalipuram have the best availability and accessibility to significant   and   parks.

 Lakeer Founder   told 
 , “The red part of the map shows GHMC wards which are not within 1 km of any major public park or garden owned by both the civic bodies. Several wards in the South, East and North of the city seem to have no walkable access to major GHMC/HMDA parks. We have taken into account 49 major parks of GHMC and urban forests of HMDA and not considered odd colony parks. Having major parks and public open spaces is a key parameter for scoring high in the liveability index.”
 
 Experts have produced the visualisation maps by combing the data from different agencies in urban governance. “Greening can be build in red part of the map through vertical gardens. Parks and open spaces reduce pollution and add up to greenery. They are the best places for leisure in cities with concrete jungles. Civic bodies should invest more in setting up parks in the upcoming areas,” Lakeer Founder said.
 
 She added, “There are a lot of overlaps in one-kilometre radius which shows there is a potential for interconnection of the parks. We have mapped around 70 parks. Newer areas like   also need better parks.”
 
 Experts could not find certain parks like Musi landscape garden, Bougainvillea Garden, Climber Garden, Ficus Garden, Sacred Plants Garden, Annamaiah Colony Park, Balavihar Colony Park, Central Bank Colony, L.B. Nagar, Tirumala Hills, Noor Mohammed Kunta STP Park, Venkateshwara Swami Temple and Jillelaguda on satellite or regular maps.
