Thane: Municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal expressed concern over the slower pace of nearly 146 developmental projects being undertaken in the city. He held a four-hour-long review, on Wednesday, of the projects including Retibunder Chowpatty, foot overbridges at Ghodbunder Road, grade separator at Teen Haath Naka and waterways project. Elections were cited as the major reason for the pace slowing down, as several department heads were assigned poll duty, said sources. “Jaiswal had initiated several developmental projects after he had taken charge,” said a civic official. He added that the commissioner asked the respective department heads to ensure that the pace is picked up. Jaiswal also said that officers who made the effort to add value to their assigned works will be rewarded on a monthly basis. tnn
