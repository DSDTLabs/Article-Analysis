NEW DELHI: The   (SHO) of   and three other staff have been sent to the police lines for allegedly getting into a heated argument with a group of complainants. The complainants came to the police station after two groups clashed over playing cricket. 

 Around 6.30pm on Saturday, a group of youths clashed with some teenagers over playing cricket at a DDA park near   in Mehrauli. The situation worsened as some locals joined in, leading to a fight. As the police control room was informed, a team from the police station reached the spot and brought the situation under controlled. A few people were also detained for questioning. 
 
  However, late in the night, members of one group reached the police station to register a complaint. "The incident took place in presence of the police where one Naser had thrashed my son," claimed Vijay Pal Singh, who led the group. Singh alleged that an argument broke between him and anti-terror officer Kumar Kundan who refused to register an FIR and make any arrest without conducting an inquiry. 
 
 He added that a member of the group was recording the incident on his mobile phone but Kundan suddenly snatched the phone and thrashed him. When others tried to intervene, they too were heckled by the police. Area councillor Aarti Yadav and some of her supporters also reached the police station and staged a protest demanding action against the officers. 
 
 On Sunday morning, senior officers initiated an inquiry following which SHO Vikramjit Singh, Kundan, SI Prabhat and constable Mahesh were sent to the police lines. "They have been asked to report to the lines until the inquiry is completed," said  , additional DCP, south. 
 
  On Sunday evening, members of the other group registered a complaint against Singh's son for hitting a youth, Jasar Khan, on his left ear. "We are going through the compliant," said an officer. Khan said the police were acting partially.
