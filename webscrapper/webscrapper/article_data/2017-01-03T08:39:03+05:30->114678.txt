MUMBAI: Civic officials finally completed the   of an unauthorized structure that functioned as actor Arjun Kapoor’s terrace gym on Monday. 

 The   will now collect charges from the actor for sending its staff to his Juhu residence for three days to dismantle the entire structure. The charges could be around Rs 10,000, said a civic source. 
 
 The civic body said Kapoor had encroached on the terrace of   by constructing a 30x16 sq ft glass-and-brick room without permission. He lives on the seventh floor of the building. An activist, who does not live in the building, had complained to the municipal corporation about the irregularity.
 
 In March, the BMC sent a notice to Kapoor stating that he had encroached on the terrace of his building by constructing a 30x16 sq ft brick and glass room without permission. The actor’s manager approached the ward officer and sought more time to regularize the irregularities, but when nothing happened on ground, the BMC issued a notice asking Kapoor to demolish the structure.
 
 On December 30, the municipal staff visited Kapoor’s flat to begin demolition of illegal structure. After the actor’s staff requested them to allow them dismantle the gym in their presence, the glass wall was pulled down. On January 1, the civic staff again visited the flat to ensure removal of other unauthorized extensions, but they were unable to complete the task due to labour shortage. Kapoor was unavailable for comment on both days. 
 
 The civic staff returned on Monday and worked till late evening to ensure the entire structure was razed.
