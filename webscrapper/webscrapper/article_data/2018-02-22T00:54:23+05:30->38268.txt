NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday declined to wade into the row between Delhi government’s bureacrats and its elected representatives over an alleged assault on chief secretary   by a few MLAs. 

  refused to entertain a   seeking immediate judicial intervention into the alleged assault that occured during a meeting at chief minister Arvind  's residence earlier this week.
 
 After the issue was mentioned by way of a plea for urgent hearing before a bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, the court made it clear that the police is already investigating the incident and it would wait for the final outcome.
 
 “They (police) will take action in accordance with law. We will wait for the final outcome,” the bench said, adding that both sides have a different story as per reports.
 
 The petitiner, an advocate, had urged for judicial intervention on the ground that people of the city would suffer if “elected (MLAs) and selected (bureaucrats)” fight among themselves. “Both the representatives have to work in accordance with the rules made for Delhi with regard to its functioning and administration,” the petitioner had submitted.
