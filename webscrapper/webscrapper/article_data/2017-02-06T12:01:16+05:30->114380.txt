The latest to appear on 
  couch were star couple   and wife  . Together, the two opened up about how they met and got married. Not just that, thanks to the host that   is, they also got talking about their sex life, something that had been carefully kept away from the prying media eyes. Here's what they had to say when Karan asked them questions about their private life in his (in) famous rapid fire round:

 1)
 When Karan asked Mira about the deal-breaker in marriage, out of cheating, interfering in-laws, bad sex and boredom, Mira elaborated that she doesn't have interfering in-laws, they are not bored yet, they don't have bad sex, so cheating was the only factor that she'd not be okay with.
 
 2) 
 It was a simple 'yes' by Mira when Karan quizzed her about having made out in the car. Shahid, however, was left confused, and could not stop himself from asking her about the details of when it happened. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3) 
 They are certainly not the ones to be shy about showing their affection in public (considering they even made Karan blush with their PDA on the show). Mira was cool about admitting that the two kiss in presence of others all the time, even during family meetings.
 
 4) 
 Taking the kiss story a little further, during the rapid fire round, Mira also confessed that Shahid is a natural kisser. To which, even Shahid seemed in agreement. Karan Johar, who is single himself, couldn't stop himself from gushing at their answers.
