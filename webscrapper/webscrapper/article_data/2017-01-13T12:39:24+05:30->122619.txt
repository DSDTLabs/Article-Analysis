DUMKA: The   (JMM) is all set to interrupt the forthcoming   and attack the government over the amendments made in the   (CNT) and   (SPT) Acts. 

 Senior JMM leader   threatened to disrupt proceedings if the government did not agree to roll back the amendments introduced in the previous session. "We can't sit idle and watch the anti-people move of the government until they (amendments) are all withdrawn. The party MLAs will not allow the assembly to function till the government agrees to withdraw the amendments introduced in the previous session," Soren said.
 
 "A meeting with the opposition leaders will be held on January 16 in Ranchi, a day before the budget session. We will chalk out a strategy to pressurise the state government to withdraw the amendments," Soren said.
