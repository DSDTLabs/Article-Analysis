GURUGRAM: GURUGRAM deputy commissioner   held a meeting with the principals of all government schools in the district — Pataudi, Sohna and Farrukhnagar block — on Wednesday following the dismal performance of Gurugram district in both Class X and XII  . 

 Gurugram was among the 10 worst performing districts across Haryana in both Class X and XII board results. 
 
 Education department officials revealed that the meeting was called to thrash out ways to improve the level of education among governemnt school students across the district.
 
 During the meeting, Singh asked the principals to identify the students, on the basis of their intellectual capacity, and put them in different sections. He claimed that this would help teachers zero in on students who need better guidance and care. He also asked the heads to put up an ‘Honour Board’ in their respective schools and highlight the achievements of the students to encourage them to aim higher. 
 
 The school principals, however, informed Singh that the quality of education was suffering as they lacked the adequate number of teachers in the schools.
 
 Singh suggested that setting up of a core committee comprising principals, teachers, district education officer and district primary education officer. The committee will carry out inspections in schools at regular intervals and suggest measures to improve the quality of education. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Singh said, “The standard of education in government schools is going down every year. There is a need to do something innovative. We have planned to start coaching classes for students during the summer vacation. We are committed to complete the syllabus for all classes in the academic year.”
