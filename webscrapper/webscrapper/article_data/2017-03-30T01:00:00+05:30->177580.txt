Close to 80 farmers have been protesting for the past two weeks at   in Delhi, demanding their loans be waived off by the nationalised banks. To extend their support,   personalities  , Prakash Raj and director   recently met them in Delhi and joined their protest for a day. 

 Elaborating about his experience with the farmers, Vishal says “I saw a video of an old lady, a farmer’s wife, crying and explaining her situation. The most depressing sight would be watching an elderly person cry. That video disturbed me so much that I couldn’t even sleep that night. The following day, I left to Delhi to meet them personally. I wanted to show my support to those people, who have been protesting for the past couple of weeks. We wanted to tell them that we are also with them. Their plight is heart-wrenching… we cannot let them suffer. We did what we could do at that moment and managed to meet the finance minister Arun Jaitley to express our concern.”
 
 Ask him about what they expect from the government, and he says, “When the government can waive corporate loans, which is going to benefit business giants who are already millionaires, why can’t they waive farmers’ loans? Many families will be benefit if they do so. Considering the drought situation in  , immediate action needs to be taken. There is no water even in my house, just imagine the plight of people living in remote villages.”
 
 Does he think that if celebrities join the protest, it would get more attention from the media? “I went there as a fellow human. But yes, the celebrity status would help them to get more attention from the government and the media,” he says.
