THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Setting an example to other   in the city, the corporation which will take over the administration of the  , has made one crucial change in the bylaw approved by the council. The change has been effected in the  . 

 While the original bylaw had stipulated that all inmates should enter the hostel by 7pm and that consent of matron was required for any kind of relaxation in timings, mayor V K Prasanth told the council that the timing has been changed to 9pm. The hostel was earlier run by Kerala state women's development corporation.
 
 The change has been spurred by a popular opinion that fixing the night-time   at 7pm would spark off protests and that it was unbecoming of a council that constantly moots projects for women safety.
 
 Deputy mayor Rakhi Ravikumar said that the 7pm deadline was illogical. 
 
 “We worked on the bylaw and decided to effect this change as it will emphasize corporation's proclaimed stand on liberty of women,” said Rakhi Ravikumar. Several women may have to stay out late owing to work or research purpose and with the extension of timings they need not worry about breaking the rules, Rakhi added.
 
 The students of CET had in 2015 launched ‘Break the Curfew’ campaign demanding extension of curfew timings in hostels.
 
 The corporation had earlier launched a short-stay home close to the hostel aimed at accommodating those women who are employed or are pursuing higher education in the city. 
 
 A short-stay home was mooted as a safe, economical option for accommodation of women in 2015.
 
 Corporation's short-stay home for women was completed at a cost of Rs 25 lakhs. 
 
 The civic body has also tied up with Kudumbashree to run ‘She lodge’ on the same premises, opening up more facilities for women seeking accommodation in the city.
