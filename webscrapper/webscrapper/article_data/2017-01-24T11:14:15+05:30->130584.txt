CHARMINAR: Soon,   stretch could flaunt a new-age tramway, much like the one   in the  .

 This was announced at an event in the city on Monday , where authorities shared that the tramway line might be laid along this 2.9 km tract as part of the ongoing   (CPP). A cooperative agreement to introduce this New Generation Tramway was signed between   in October 2015.
 
 Speaking about the project, Alfred Peter, urban planner and landscaper, said: “Trams are an incredible opportunity to connect the Charminar with other areas in a cost effective and sustainable way . This also means a reorganisation and restructuring of certain areas, particularly around the Musi River.“ In an attempt to redefine urban landscape and mobility , Bordeaux rolled out the tramway project as part of a pedestrianisation campaign in the late 90s. Considered the `Urban development Renaissance', the city presently has 50 percent of public space reserved for pedestrians and bicycles.“New generation trams have tremendously helped our city albeit the long hours we spent in extensive planning. A positive outcome is inevitable,“ said Florence Forzy-Raffard, Bordeaux municipal councillor in-charge of International Economic Affairs.
 
 Being prepared as a two-line tramway system, the estimated cost of the project, officials said, is `100 crore. According to architect Marc Barani, tramways are different from metro rails.“They are modified to suit the local environment“ he said.
 
 Concurring this thought, Hyderabad mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan stressed the need to strengthen the city's public transport system and make it smarter. “A good transport system will change our urban landscape,“ he said.
