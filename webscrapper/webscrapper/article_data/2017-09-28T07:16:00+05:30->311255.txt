GURUGRAM: The station house officer (SHO) of   was transferred to Police Lines on Tuesday purportedly for impounding a car carrying liquor — which police say belongs to a supporter of local MLA Tejpal   — during the recently concluded  . Cops said the car may have belonged to a candidate of ward 26.

 While police insisted it was a routine transfer, sources revealed that the move came after inspector Rajender Singh, while on night patrolling duty in   road area on September 23, he intercepted a Scorpio and challaned the driver for allegedly carrying 16 bottles of whisky. 
 
 According to sources, the SHO, along with his team, had set up barricades on Sohna road and intercepted a Scorpio based on suspicion. Three people who were in the car managed to escape, while police arrested the driver, Prashant, a resident of Delhi. But he was later let off on police bail the same day. An FIR was registered under Section 61 (1) (14) of the Punjab Excise Act at Badshapur police station.
 
 “He found illegal liquor in the car and took action. The driver boasted of his links with Sohna MLA Tejpal Tanwar and even called him up. Singh told Tanwar that he has done his duty and Tanwar was free to seek respite from the police commissioner. This infuriated Tanwar, and he hung up the phone saying he would now talk to the CM. So when the CM came to Gurgaon on Tuesday, Singh got transferred. Had it been a routine transfer, Singh wouldn’t have been the only one. It has put all our morale down,” said a police officer.
 
 When contacted, Tanwar denied having any role in the transfer. “I have got nothing to do with this transfer. I am being pulled into it without any reason. I have not complained to the chief minister about anybody,” he said.
 
 Former SHO inspector Rajender Singh, denied saying anything about the allegation and added that transfers are part of departmental processes.Gurgaon police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar, too, said it was just a routine transfer.
