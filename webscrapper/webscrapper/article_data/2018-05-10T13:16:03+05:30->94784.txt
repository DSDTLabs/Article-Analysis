GUNTUR: Utter chaos prevailed in the city, following the diversion of   from Three-Bridges Centre. Movement on city roads became a herculean task for the locals as all the roads were literally packed with vehicles. People experienced a very difficult time when moving from Sankar Vilas Flyover during the peak hours as it was taking more than 20 to 30 minutes to cross the half-a-kilometre-long flyover.

 
 The underpass at Three-Bridges Centre has become a vital junction to connect One-Town area particularly   which houses most of the hospitals of the city with the Two-Town area. Many practising doctors reside in Two-Town area. They use the   to reach the Old Club Road as there has been heavy traffic on Sankar Vilas Flyover in the recent past. However, the closure of the Three-Bridges Road forced the locals to opt for the lone option of Sankar Vilas Flyover.
 
 Although, the city police initiated some smart moves to regulate traffic, the narrow roads and absence of the traffic signals complicated the issue. Over half-a-dozen roads originating from APSRTC Bus Complex are directly connected to Sankar Vilas Flyover resulting in heavy vehicle congestion at one point.
 
 A new shopping mall has come up in   which has reportedly complicated matters for the traffic police. Although, the mall has a massive parking lot with three-level parking to accommodate over 3,000 vehicles, hundreds of vehicles are allowed to park on   creating additional hurdles for the movement of the vehicles. “The traffic police should not allow the vehicles to be parked outside the mall and opposite to the Gunta Ground. Parking on both sides of the main road has turned this area into a no-moving zone,” rued K Ramarao, a merchant of a medical shop located on the road.
