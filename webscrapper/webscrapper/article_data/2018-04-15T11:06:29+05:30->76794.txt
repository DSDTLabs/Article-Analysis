CHARMINAR: Telangana State   board has decided to introduce an e-filing system, where all documents pertaining to land would be saved online and can be referred to whenever required. The board took this step to take action on rampant encroachment of their properties. 

 The e-filing system would begin from April 18 and, in the first phase; files of one section will be computerized. Chief executive officer (CEO) Shahnawaz Qasim, IPS, has hired the services of information technology department experts to execute the work on making everything transparent and online. The CEO also said that files would be computerized within three months.
 
 "All the records of Waqf board will be saved after completion of the project and the   will not get any chance to manipulate the records," he said.
 
 Shahnawaz added that the records hold importance in the preservation of Waqf properties and many a time Waqf board has failed to get a judgment in its favour in the court for not producing relevant documents from their record in time.
 
 Shahnawaz, who took charge as the Waqf board CEO earlier this month, vowed to bring transparency and efficiency in   Board. After taking charge, he also said that he would try to enhance the redressal system in the board by conducting a public hearing once weekly.
 
 "The focus would be on using new technology for the protection of Waqf properties," he said.
 
 This is the first time a police officer had been given the task of CEO, whereas in the past, police officers were appointed as special officers in the absence of board.
