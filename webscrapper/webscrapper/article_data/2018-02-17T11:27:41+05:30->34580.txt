CHENNAI: Two days after TOI published a news report about how road contractors of Greater   relaid a road around an   in Natesa Nagar,  , the authorities removed the dusty old sedan and patched up the surface on Thursday.

 On Monday night, contractors knocked the doors of residents living on the 4th Main Road, Natesa Nagar and asked them not to park their cars or two-wheelers on the road as they were to relay the road. All cars but for a dusty, battered Ford Icon (TN01 Y 8791) were removed by residents. As road contractors outsourced by the civic agency were unable to trace the owner of the sedan, they gave the road a new top around the car, leaving the space in which the car was parked untouched. 
 
 When TOI spoke to corporation executive engineer V Periasami, he promised to fix the patch on Thursday. Late on Wednesday, the car was removed and and the patch was repaired between Thursday night and Friday morning. 
 
 “We did not expect them to fix it so fast,” said Natesa Nagar Civic Welfare Association former head M Natarajan. “We just hope the corporation didn’t pay any additional money to fix this problem. I wish they notify residents ahead of time so such issues can be sorted out. It would be a take away for the association and the civic body,” he said.
