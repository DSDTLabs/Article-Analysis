AHMEDABAD: Seven years ago, the superintendent of stamps had instructed all district collectors to rectify anomalies with respect to Annual Schedule of Rates ( ) or ‘Jantri’ rates, a government tool to find out the minimum value of a property at different locations based on various market factors. 

 When the   test checked in 2017, it found that the anomalies remained and that between 2011 and 2017 several land transactions had already taken placed based on the faulty ASR rates. The auditing body in its test cases conducted in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Patan, Surendranagar, Godhra and   districts found cases where non-irrigation land rates were higher than irrigated land rates, rates of interior areas was higher than those located near national of state highways, while in many instances, the CAG found that the value of residential plots were higher than commercial plots. 
 
  The CAG pointed out incorrect or unrealistic rates, final plot numbers or city survey numbers were shown as survey numbers.
 
 The superintendent of stamps had categorically mentioned in 2011 circular to all districts to revise the composite rates for ASR-2011 if it was below Rs 5,000 per sq mt or Rs 6,000 per sq mt. The CAG noted that the circular did not mention in which category will these increased new rates will apply — for instance flats, shops, offices or open plots. The audit body noticed that in the nine districts for flats, shops, offices in many instances the composite rates in cities were maintained to be less than Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000, while in rural areas where these composite rates were not applied the new ASR-2011 “constructed property” rates of Rs 9,100 per sq mt was applied. This was a flat of same size in rural areas costed more than in urban. The CAG was critical of the careless approach and noted that the circular to make the necessary changes was not adhered to for seven years.
