MUMBAI: The  's plans to increase entry charges to the city zoo--Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan & Zoo--in Byculla picked up steam on Saturday. TOI reported on Saturday about the civic body's plan to hike the entry fee from Rs 5 to Rs 50, and Rs 100 to view the penguins.

 Trustees of the Save   Foundation who, since a decade, have been working towards protecting the botanical garden have taken strong objection to the steep hike in entry charges. On Saturday, they shot off a letter to the civic standing committee chairman, pointing out that the rise in entry charge could lead to the botanical garden being converted into an elitist facility for the well heeled.
 
 “We are taking this issue as seriously as we took up that of protection and preservation of the heritage botanical garden of Rani Baug,“ said Hutokshi Rustomfram, trustee of the Save Rani Bagh Botanical Garden Foundation. “This is an issue of open space and of access to an egalitarian botanical garden that has been so for more than 150 years. We plan to launch an online petition to create awareness and garner support from common citizens and will utilize all democratic means of protest available to common citi zens to achieve our objective.“
 
 The foundation has been actively working with the BMC on the revamp of the gardens and in the past has also raised the issue with the civic chief. “In fact, the BMC has been very supportive so far and accepted many of the suggestions given by us in some cases altering the revamp plan as well to preserve the botanical garden,“ said Rustomfram.
 
 Shubhada Nikharge, another trustee of the foundation, said that the BMC spent almost Rs 2 crore of taxpayers' money to import the  . “If the authorities say that the children of Mumbai should know about the gardens and get a chance to see the penguins, then why hike entry charges so steeply?“ said Nikharge.
