Hyderabad:   railway station, which records afootfall of over 1.2 lakh travellers a day, is a sitting duck for terrorists. Terror elements can easily walk in, create mayhem and walk out of the premises as the `world-class' railway station falls short of the necessary security set-up and manpower.

 The Secunderabad rail way station, which the railway minister had promised to convert into a world-class station, requires at least five luggage detectors. However, there are only three scanners and of them only one is functional.Apart from that, a senior railway official said they need 124 closed circuit television came ras (CCTV) to cover the entire premises. However, only 80   cameras were currently installed. “Of the 80, 24 CCTV cameras are not func tional,“   (GRP), Secunderabad, superintendent of police (SP), S  .
 
 “Lack of metal detectors and luggage scanners is hampering our work in finding offenders who carry or transport drugs, ganja or weapons,“ the SP added.
 
 In the past three years, overall crime has come down, but ganja cases doubled, the GRP official said. Apart from shortage of equipment, the department is also facing shortage of staff, especially women constable. Secunderabad station alone needs at least 10 women constable, the officials said.
 
 “We discovered that offenders had dragged women into the ganja trade. It is shocking to see women carrying infants transporting the contraband,“ director-general (Railways and Road Safety) T Krishna Prasad had said at a press briefing earlier.
 
 Currently, there were 12 railway police stations and 17 outposts, and each station has two women constables.“However, each station requires six women constables and each outpost at least three women police personnel,“ the SP added
