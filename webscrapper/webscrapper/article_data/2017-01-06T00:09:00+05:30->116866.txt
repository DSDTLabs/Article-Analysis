JAIPUR: After receiving thumbs down from the Water and   (WAPCOS), a government of India undertaking, the ambitious project to develop an   at Jalore has now been dumped by the Rajasthan’s water resources department.

 A dream project of Union transport minister   and chief minister Vasundhara Raje, the project will now be put in the backburner. Both the Centre and state had explored ways to develop an artificial inland port in Jalore by channeling sea water from Arabian Sea into Rajasthan through Gujarat.
 
 However, the state government’s own department has now raised the red flag and declared the project unviable. Among major objections, the department has pointed out despite the inland waterways project being a subject of the  , the concerned department was kept away from it.
 
 The department also highlighted that the route has been declared as a national waterway which bars the state from carrying out any activity in the area. “We studied the project and found that the inland waterway is a subject of the transport department and not that of the water resources department. This has been conveyed to the government,” said  , secretary, water resources department.
 
 In October 2016, Gadkari had claimed that he would solve the water problems of Rajasthan with this project. “I have a dream project to make a 850-km long canal from Kandla at the border of Gujarat/Rajasthan to Jaisalmer and Jalore. This will change the economy of Rajasthan and Gujarat,” the Union shipping minister had said.
 
 Moreover, it has also emerged that WAPCOS, which was asked to submit a feasibility report, has evaluated the internal rate of return (IRR) as negative. Reservations raised by the defense authorities and ecological sensitivity of the area are the other reason for junking the project.
