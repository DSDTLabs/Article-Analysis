RANCHI: Inspired by the new   chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s move, the   have independently introduced anti-romeo squads (ARS) in the city to curb harassment. However, the squad, which has been active since Thursday, has come under the radar for moral policing like the squads in Uttar Pradesh.

 The police said more than 30 harassers were rounded up on Friday and more than a dozen were caught by Saturday afternoon. The fact that there were 104 cases of rape till August 2016, the highest in any district, justifies the existence of such commandos. 
 
 Akanksha Tiwari (name changed for purposes of anonymity) said, “I think the move would be great if it is executed in the right manner. I don’t think it is right to harass couples.”
 
 SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi said, “The primary aim is stop harassment and create deterrence. The move is in no way an attempt to introduce moral policing. We have briefed the forces and they will not target couples or involve in any male bashing. But, they will take stern action against anti-social elements.”
 
 Dwivedi added that there has been a decrease in anti-social elements around colleges, coaching institutes and girls’ hostel.
