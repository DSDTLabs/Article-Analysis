AMRITSAR:   will operate between Amritsar and Kuala Lampur four days a week. This was stated by Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu here on Wednesday. Talking to newspersons, along with Air Asia officials Suresh Nair and Beniyamin Ismail, Sidhu said the flight would commence around  .

 He said the new flight would also provide an opportunity to connect to Australia and New Zealand from Kaula Lampur. Stating that a successfully operating airport could change the fortunes of any city and help in propelling its gross domestic product (GDP), Sidhu said the state government was open to facilitating anyone who wanted to operate from Amritsar. He said in the past one year the tourist flow to Amritsar had grown and it was the duty of the government to raise voice and give maximum flying options by roping in more flights and motivating them to operate from the holy city.
 
 On the issue of a video clip of   leader   allegedly admitting his involvement in the killing of 100 Sikhs during the 1984 riots in Delhi, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said whoever was found to be a culprit should be hanged publicly in the square. He said he had also suffered and added that the Constitution didn’t discriminate on the basis of caste, colour or creed. “Anyone from any party or background, if found guilty should be hanged in a square, which will also serve as a deterrent,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, district unit of SAD staged a protest against the Congress and burnt effigies of its president  , former chief   and Tytler.
