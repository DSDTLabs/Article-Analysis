KOLKATA: After Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) took the decision to set question papers for annual examination in class IX and XI, the body has now gone ahead to prescribe   for English Literature (English paper II) for both classes. The students will be tested on the selected syllabus in the annual examinations. 

 However, ICSE the candidates will be examined on complete English literature syllabus - taught in both classes IX and X - and   students will be tested on the combined syllabus of classes XI and XII.
 
 Principal of Central Modern School, Baranagar, Nabarun De, said, "The English literature syllabus in both ICSE and ISC is not a bifurcated curriculum with portions mentioned and specified for class IX and X and XI and XII. As the Council is sending question papers, all schools need to teach the specified text - prose, short stories, plays and poems - is to be covered by all candidates in each class. The syllabus for students of classes IX to XII has to be henceforth uniform across the country in all CISCE affiliated schools."
 
 De gave an example: All schools have been told to teach specified number of acts from ' ' so that students can answer from the set question papers.
 
 A city school principal said the Council decided to fix the syllabus as teachers had a tendency to teach heavier portions in lower classes rather than the senior level. "This led to stress among English Literature students as the subject is already of a very high standard. The schools preferred to teach kids more chapters/acts so that extra time could be devoted for revision before board exams," she said.
 
 The principal of  , Sujoy Biswas, said the move will help students secure better marks and concentrate on specific syllabus.
