 "From the time our country got independence, I have been hearing of 'garibi hatao' (removing poverty), which still remains a slogan. I have asked my son for his camera so that I can click a few pictures of slums and poverty. I will write an article and send it to newspapers," Vaishya said. 
 
 He also gave the credit of his success in the examination to his daughter-in-law Bharati S Kumar, a retired Patna College professor of history. "It's a proud moment for us," said his son  , also a retired professor.
