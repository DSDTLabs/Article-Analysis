LUDHIANA: As many as 10 long route trains running to and from the national capital arrived late by several hours on Sunday at the Ludhiana railway station, due to ongoing construction work of limited height subway, including laying new railway lines on the   railway route here on Saturday, which irked passengers waiting for them on different platforms of the city station.

 Trains coming from far-off places like Uttar Pradesh,  , and West Bengal remained the worst affected, as they arrived late by more than eight to nine hours, which made passengers restless. Himgiri Express from Howrah to Amritsar arrived late by more than 16 hours at 12.45pm, instead of 8pm on Saturday night. Lohit Express from Guwahati to   arrived late by more than nine hours at 4.15pm, instead of 7am. Jansewa Express from Saharsa to Amritsar was also running late by eight hours. Tata Muri Express from Tata Nagar to Jammu Tawi arrived late by more than nine hours at 2.25pm, instead of 5.15am. Avadh-Assam Express arrived four hours late at 11am, instead of 7am, and Lohit Express was delayed by more than five hours, arriving at 1.10pm instead of 7.30am.
 
 Ludhiana railway station superintendent   stated: “Construction work for the betterment of rail infrastructure is going on throughout the Northern Railways division, so trains coming from UP, Bihar, and Kolkata side arrived late by several hours. Another reason for the unusual delay in arrival of trains were the several summer special trains running, which led to congestion.”
