HYDERABAD : Hyderabad dentist Mujahid Ali Khan, who was arrested for killing blackbucks in Basavakalyan in Karnataka on March 30, has been released on bail.

  station house officer Sunil Kumar said, “The accused is free on bail and reached Hyderabad on Saturday. We have served a notice on him to give us details regarding his vehicle. The registration number of the vehicle is AP M 4835.” A search on the Andhra Pradesh Transport Department website shows that the number is invalid. The jeep has been customised to carry out hunting, according to police.
 
 Basavakalyan police arrested   Ali Khan and four others under Sections 9 and 51 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act for hunting and killing three blackbucks, which is a Schedule-1animal.
 
 Mujahid Ali Khan, son of Mohammed Hameed khan, is a resident of Masab Tank and went on a hunting trip from Hyderabad to Basavakalyan. Police seized 12 blackbuck legs, 40kg meat, two blackbuck antlers and a Toyota land cruiser jeep after his arrest. A knife and .22 rounds were also found. Two other Hyderabadis, identified as Syed Ajar, son of one Syed umar, resident of Misri Ganj and Yakoob, son of one Youshoof Shaik, were also arrested and released on bail.
 
 Karnataka police in the FIR mentioned that deer meat and deer legs were seized instead of blackbucks’. Blackbucks are a schedule 1 animal and deer a schedule 3 animal. Hunting the former is a non-bailable offence and the latter is a bailable offence. “Mujahid Ali Khan said he is working in Dubai,” said  . Dr Khan was in October 2014 involved in the hunting of a pregnant   in the   of Telangana.
