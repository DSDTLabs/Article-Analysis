PUNE: A 29-year-old   found a way to overcome his financial losses in   transactions. He stole his neighbour’s documents, forged them and applied for credit cards in five   

 When the neighbour, a software engineer, began getting verification e-mails from the banks, he grew suspicious as he had not applied for the cards. He alerted the cyber crime cell of the Pune police. 
 
 Before an employee of the bank could meet the suspect for the verification, the cyber crime cell team headed by inspector Radhika Phadke traced the suspect, Smith Salve (29) of Pimple Gurav, and arrested him for cheating.
 
 Phadke said, “Salve holds a degree in hotel management and deals in shares. He lives near the complainant Brijesh Nandan. Recently, Salve lost heavily in the share market. He wanted to overcome the losses and he noticed a parcel in Nandan’s name in the post box. He stole the parcel and found the documents in Nandan’s name. He went to a cyber cafe and forged the documents but with his own photograph and contact number. The suspect then applied for credit cards in five different banks, including four private sector ones, and a public sector bank, for unlimited credit facility.” 
 
 After receiving the documents, the banks sent emails to Nandan as his e-mail address was mentioned in the documents. 
 
 “Initially, Nandan ignored the mails. When he started getting more mails from the different banks, he went to the banks,” Phadke said.
 
 Nandan was shocked after seeing the documents in his name but with the photograph of another person. Nandan lodged a complaint with the police. “We found that most banks had sanctioned the credit cards and only the verification process was pending,” Phadke said.
 
 On Thursday, after receiving the call from the bank for verification, Salve asked the employee to meet him at a shop near his house. “We laid a trap and arrested him. We have recovered a cellphone and four debit cards from Salve,” Phadke said.
