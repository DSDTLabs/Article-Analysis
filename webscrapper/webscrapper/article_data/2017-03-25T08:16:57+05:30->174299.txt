AMARAVATI: After two long days of argument the Assembly on Friday passed a resolution giving a clean chit to agriculture minister   in the charges levelled against him by opposition leader Y S  's. The resolution was passed in the absence of the   president. 

 The house unanimously condemned the behaviour and attitude of the opposition and its leader during the debate. By adopting a resolution rejecting allegations against Pulla Rao, the government has successfully managed to avoid a judicial probe promised by chief minister  .
 
  "Where is the need to go for judicial probe as the opposition leader had run away from the House fearing he would lose his job. He had failed to stick to his charges and accept the challenge for a judicial probe," said legislative affairs minister  . In fact, there is no need for the government to respond to such baseless allegations, he added.
 
 Later, outside the Assembly, Prathipati accused Jagan of taking huge amounts from AgriGold promotoers. While Jagan, in a separate press meet, challenged Naidu to go for byelections by making the turncoat MlAs quit the Assembly.
