RAJKOT: The   ( ) and representatives of maldharis (cattle owners) community of Rajkot city met on Wednesday to decide on the new place for latter’s relocation. Earlier, the maldharis faced opposition from locals of Lothda village which was identified for their relocation.

 Last year, the civic body had begun a special drive to expedite the process of relocation of maldharis and their cattle outside the civic body’s limits. RMC has so far received 1,658 applications giving consent to relocate the community outside Rajkot city.
 
 The issue of having a maldhari vasahat (society) has been pending since a long time. RMC had offered land and other facilities to maldharis who were willing to relocate with their cattle outside city. Under the scheme, each cattle owner gets 25 sq m land to construct a house and space to keep the cattle.
 
 “RMC had identified four villages — Baghi, Rajgadh, Amargadh (Bhichari) and Lothda, for relocation of maldharis with their cattle. All four villages are located very close to the city and is even convenient for cattle owners. However, there was some issues including local protests as well as some land belonging to forest department and its possession was likely to take time. Therefore we have zeroed in on Padasan village near Lothda and visited the place on Wednesday. Land for relocation of cattle owners will soon be finalized,” said a senior RMC official.
 
 On Wednesday, Rajkot collector  , RMC commissioner  , mayor Jaiman Upadhyay and other leaders held meeting with maldhari leaders and discussed the issues.
 
 There are around 1,700-1,800 cattle owner families living in the city who own around 20,000 animals. There have been a number of instances where human lives were lost because of the stray cattle.
