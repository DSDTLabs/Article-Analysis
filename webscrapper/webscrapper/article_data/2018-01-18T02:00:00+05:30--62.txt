PATNA: The ruling JD (U) on Wednesday ridiculed the   for deferring its ‘Aamantran Yatra’ due to inclement weather, and asked the state Congress leadership to learn a lesson or two from CM Nitish Kumar who has been criss-crossing the state as part of his monthlong ‘Vikas Sameeksha Yatra’ despite bad weather.

 Reacting over the state Congress’s decision to defer its yatra which was scheduled to begin from Vrindavan Ashram in West Champaran on January 18, JD (U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar said the Congress was actually avoiding interaction with masses.
 
 The Congress’s yatra was aimed at inviting young faces and party’s old warhorses to join the party. 
 
 According to Neeraj, the Congress functionaries like the RJD leaders in Bihar have developed a habit of living in their airconditioned homes in the cities. He recalled RJD chief Lalu Prasad, currently lodged in a Ranchi jail, recently told a CBI court in Ranchi that he was experiencing severe cold in the prison and, therefore, should be granted bail.
 
 “On the contrary, CM Nitish Kumar says he does not like running the government sitting in Patna and, therefore, keeps visiting villages,” the JD (U) functionary said.
