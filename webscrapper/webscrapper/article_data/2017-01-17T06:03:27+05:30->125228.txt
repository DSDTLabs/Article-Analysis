CONTAI:   on Monday arrested five persons, including a Contai nursing home doctor and two staffers, for selling off a baby born out of wedlock. The girl’s biological dad was among the five arrested. Cops managed to rescue the baby from a couple in Kolkata, who had bought her for Rs 50,000.

 Contai resident Padmalochan Bera worked at a Bhowanipore building as a caretaker, where he befriended a woman from the neighbourhood. Bera presented himself as a bachelor and promised to marry the woman. She became pregnant in 2015 and gave birth to a girl in April 2016 at Contai’s New Baby Nursing Home, where Bera took her for the delivery.
 
 But soon after the birth, Bera told the woman that he would not be marrying her,   superintendent of police Alok Rajoria said on Monday. The doctor and the nursing home staffers, police said, played on both the unwed parents’ fears and convinced Bera and the woman that they might get into trouble for having a baby outside marriage. The woman came back to Kolkata and Bera gave the nursing home staffers Rs 90,000 to hush up the matter.
 
 The woman’s family, however, decided to take the matter to the local police station after she kept insisting that her daughter be returned to her. “Bhowanipore police officials contacted us and we helped them track the newborn and her dad,” Rajoria said.
 
 Cops from Kolkata arrested Bera on Monday and, after a series of raids, picked up Suman Haldar — a doctor from the nursing home — and two other staffers. They led cops to a middleman, who became the fifth person to be arrested. He led cops to the Kolkata residence of the couple who had bought the girl for Rs 50,000.
