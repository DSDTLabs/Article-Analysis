HYDERABAD: With the fate of the defunct Vijayawada-based regional carrier   in a limbo, Brazilian aerospace giant   has been in the wait and watch mode as the former had placed an order of 50 jets worth $3 billion with the company.

  vice president ( ) Ceaser   pointed out that the order for 50 jets is still valid and the company is hopeful of Air Costa making a recovery. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( ) had suspendedAir Costa’s flying licencein June last year.
 
 
 Pereira added that if the DGCA cancels Air Costa’s licence then Embraer will be in a position to remove the order from its books.
 
 Not to be bogged down by the Air Costa episode, Pereira said Embraer is pinning its hopes on the UDAN scheme to boost its business prospects in the country.
 
 He pointed out the UDAN scheme, that lays thrust on regional connectivity and affordable air travel, offers great business opportunities for the company that specialises in providing fleetfor regional connectivity.
 
 “In India, the major challenge is that there is a huge gap between the 70-seater and 150-seater narrow bodied aircraft... and therefore many players are competing for the same market, leading to network concentration. And then there is a pressure to fillup seats at any fare,” Pereira said, adding that Embraer can address this gap with its E175 jet, which is designed for short to mid-range flights.
 
 The E175, in the 70-130 seat segment, features a flexible seat configuration offering airlines the option to match capacity with market demand.
