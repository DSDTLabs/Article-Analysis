Here's some alarming news. One in every three   friends for city youth is a stranger or a person they know very little about.

 And only 10% of their friends on the social networking site are family members and relatives, the Generation Z (Gen Z) survey undertaken by   (TCS) has found. The annual survey , aimed at getting a pulse of the digital habits of students from Classes VIII to XII, covered more than 11,000 students across 15 cities.
 
 As many as 50% of Facebook friends of children in cities such as Coimbatore and Lucknow are people they barely know. In Bhubaneswar and Kolkata, it was more than 40%, while it was between 30% and 40% at Bengaluru, Indore, Nagpur, Kochi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Pune.
 
 Facebook mandates a minimum age requirement of 13 years to have a page, but many students create profiles giving false birth date.
 
 This trend, say child psychologists, reflects their desperate need to seek acceptance from strangers. They feel good when they see a large `friends' list but we are missing the larger picture here. Children are getting easy access and they may have role models at home who can't see what the problem is. The virtual world is very forgiving of all their flaws. So they would definitely prefer that. In fact, some children tell me that their parents are more addicted to FB than they are,â€œ said child psychologist  .
 
 Most children love being `active' on social media, but not many understand the importance of privacy settings. Unbridled uploading of photos and chatting with strangers could snowball into something that cannot even be controlled, added Varma. While almost half of parents monitor the social activities of their kids, 23rds deleted their profiles on social media. Of those who deleted their profiles, 22% felt it was time consuming, while 12% did it under parental pressure.
 
 Several parents monitor their child's FB account and friends list, but  , a father of two, believes otherwise.
