He has, however, alleged that another aspirant was allowed to take exam despite arriving much after he did. The Muzafarnagar resident had applied for the post of ticket checker in the Railways. The exam was to be held at Vastral in Ahmedabad on January 19. Taimur reached the city on January 18.

 The next day he boarded AMTS bus from Lal Darwaja for Vastral at around 1PM. Taimur said, “One of the passengers reported that his purse with Rs 25,000 has gone missing. The conductor told the driver; who took the bus to Vastral police station. No one was allowed to leave till purse was recovered.” After the purse was found, Taimur reached the Vastral centre only to be informed he won’t be allowed to take the exam as he was late by two minutes. The reporting time for the exam was from 2.30 pm to 3.15 pm and Taimur reached at 3.17 pm.
 
 “I begged the officer on duty but he refused my pleas and asked me to write the reason for reaching late. I did so but was still not allowed to appear for the exam. Another candidate who arrived later than me was allowed inside,” said a visibly depressed Taimur. Mirror contacted Chairman of Railway Recruitment Board, Parmeshwar Funkwal, “We have received Taimur’s application and the probe is on. Prima facie we have come to know that he was late at the centre, but further investigation is on. Once the clock has gone past the reporting time, we do not allow any one inside.” He has even tweeted his plight to the prime minister.
