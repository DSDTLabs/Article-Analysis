NEW DELHI: A 
  on Thursday agreed that the BJP would be the frontrunner in   while disagreeing on whether it would get a majority. 

 In Punjab, there was unanimity that the Akali Dal-BJP combine would face a meltdown but no consensus on whether the   or AAP would finish in front. The polls also differed on the outcome in   and   while projecting the BJP as the largest party in a possibly hung Goa assembly.
 
 While every one of the exit polls put the BJP in front, the SP-Congress alliance in second spot and the BSP third in UP, the number of seats projected for the BJP and its allies varied from 161 to 285, a range that makes either a 
  or a clear winner possible if any of the polls are accurate. The lowest estimate for the BJP alliance came from CVoter, which gave the saffron combine around 161 seats in the 403-member assembly; the top of the range was Today’s Chankya’s estimate of 285. Three of the six polls saw no clear winner while the rest gave the BJP a majority.
 
 On Punjab, all but one poll saw the ruling Akali-BJP alliance being reduced to single digits in the 117-member assembly. One pollster, CVoter, gave the AAP a clear majority with 63 seats and another, Axis, gave the Congress a majority, but the rest predicted a close contest between the two and a hung house. In fact, two suggested absolute parity between AAP and Congress.
 
 Three out of five polls on Uttarakhand said the Congress-ruled state would go to the BJP, one said the Congress would win and another predicted a dead heat with neither getting to the half-way mark. 
 
 The situation in Manipur, also ruled by Congress, was similar, with one poll predicting a clear though narrow win for the incumbent and another suggesting BJP would finish just short of a majority. With this poll projecting there would be 12 “others“, many presumably averse to Congress, a BJP government is possible in the state for the first time.
