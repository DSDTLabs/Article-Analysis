AMARAVATI: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday said the Velugodu-Nandyal water project would be named after Nandyal MLA Bhuma  , whose sudden death was condoled by members of the   here. 

 After introducing a condolence motion in the Assembly, Naidu said that the government will take steps to ensure that Nagi Reddy’s contributions are remembered forever. “This is not the right time to make further announcements as the code of conduct for MLC elections is in force,” he said, assuring that Nagi Reddy’s wish to develop Nandyal would be fulfilled.
 
 Naidu said that the government made all efforts to ensure the best medical services to Nagi Reddy. “I personally tried to arrange a chopper and the best team of doctors for him,” he said, adding that steps will be taken to improve medical facilities in Kurnool district.
 
 The event was not without controversies as YSR Congress boycotted the condolence session. Even though the opposition leaders were present in the building, they confined themselves to their party office. “Had we gone to the House, we would have been forced to talk about the mistakes Bhuma Nagi Reddy had committed along with the good things he had done,”   chief Jaganmohan Reddy said, alleging that Naidu had lured the MLA with promise of a ministerial berth.
 
 Naidu found fault with the main opposition party and said that even though he had differences with former CM and Jagan’s father Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, he had paid his respects at the time of his death. “Paying homage to the deceased is part of our culture. We may have political or ideological differences but we, as human beings, should be there for one another,” he said.
 
 Jagan also found fault with the CM for making Nagi Reddy’s daughter, Allagadda MLA Bhuma Akhilapriya, attend the Assembly within two days of the MLA’s death, a charge that was denied by her. She said she attended the session as it was her duty and that the boycott by YSRC had pained her.
