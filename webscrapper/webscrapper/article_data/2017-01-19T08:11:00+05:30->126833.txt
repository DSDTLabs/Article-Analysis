HYDERABAD: With 800 startups rearing their he ad here every six months, Hyderabad could soon zoom past its closest rival, Bengaluru, say market analysts. At present, the Karnataka capital -recently listed as the world's most dynamic city in a survey tabled at the   in Davos -is the tech hotspot of India.Hyderabad stands fifth on the international list that grades cities primarily on its achievements in technology and innovation.

 “In the next three to five years, we'll beat Bengaluru in IT growth. The research and innovation being undertaken in this part of the country is phenomenal,“ said Ramesh Loganathan, former president,  .
 
 While this consistent growth coupled with affordable living and sufficient educational institutions does position Hyderabad as a dynamic city , there continues to be gaps in its basic amenities, feel residents. “It's always nice to see Hyderabad growing, but the one thing that is constant and seldom addressed is the condition of roads. Most of them are in a deplorable state,“ said K Sai, a resident of Kukatpally .
 
 Another civic loophole is lack of public toilets. “How can we expect to be a worldclass city if we cannot even provide people with this basic facility?“ asked Srinivas U, a PhD aspirant.
 
 To add to the list of problems is the acute shortage of water that haunts the city every summer. “The situation has only worsened over the past couple of years. There are days when I have to wait for hours to be able to fetch two buckets of water,“ said Sakshi Gupta, who lives in Chandanagar.
