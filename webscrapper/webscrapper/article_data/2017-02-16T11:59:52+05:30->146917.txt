PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Citizens’ Forum ( ) has urged candidates contesting the civic elections to submit their videos that will be uploaded on the forum’s website for the benefit of voters.

 The state election commission (SEC) has directed each candidate to create a short video related to her/his vision for the ward. The video would be uploaded on the website of voluntary organisations. Speaking with TOI, convener of PCCF   said that the civic election department had contacted the forum with regards to this work.
 
 He said that interested candidates must fill up the Google form and avail the facility to upload the video. 
 
 Sharing details about the video content, Deshpande said, “In the video, the candidate is expected to speak about the vision for his panel ward and the city. S/he must also speak about the reason why voter must pick them, provide information about their candidature and his/her achievements. The candidates can express their views on PCCF’s citizens’ manifesto, which is optional.”
 
 According to Deshpande, the videos will be scrutinized on Friday and later uploaded on PCCF’s Facebook page. The panel-wise schedule of uploading videos will be announced soon.
 
 On January 21, the SEC had informed civic chiefs of the 10 municipal corporations, which are going to polls on February 21, that voluntary organizations can shoot two-three-minute videos with the candidates’ prior permission so as to share information about them. However, these videos are not to be uploaded to the municipal corporations’ websites.
