INDORE: In a bid to prevent   smuggling, monitor their health and improve   yield, 1.4 lakh milk-producing animals are being tagged with Aadhaar-like unique identification number.

 At the time of selling, the owner will be given a registration proof of the tagged cattle. It can be transferred to the next owner. With the help of numbers printed on the  , age, breed and other details about the animal can be accessed online.
 
 Besides, the department will also maintain data of feed intake of the animals and their milk yield. It will be used for research purpose to provide possible treatment, if any, to the cattle to improve their health. A team of national-level scientists are examining the data at National Dairy Development Board in Gujarat.
 
 According to the officials, the male cattle will not be tagged. Presently, cows and buffaloes are being tagged, while other milk-producing animals will be included on instructions of the Central government.
