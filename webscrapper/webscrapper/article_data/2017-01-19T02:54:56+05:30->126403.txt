 A bench of   and   also asked   (DDA) by when it will be able to link its DDA   to the  .
 
 “File a status report in four weeks on the steps taken,” the court directed even as it asked National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to specify status of the PWD proposal pending with it on construction of an underpass in the same area at Mahipalpur crossing.
 
 On its part, NHAI said it has received the proposal from PWD and forwarded it to its own consultant for comments. NHAI said after receiving comments the stage of final approval will arise, prompting the bench to direct it to give a report in four weeks time.
 
 Meanwhile the PWD said it has written to Airport Authority of India, DIAL and the Ridge Management Board in connection with the proposed underpass so that their stand can be taken and objections or concerns if any can be addressed.
 
 HC had earlier asked PWD to finalise the plan of the underpass that is likely to cut down traffic on the current route via Rao Tula Ram Marg. The court has been tracking progress of the project saying all agencies must come up with a "comprehensive proposal" even as PWD broadens the existing flyover at RTR into a three-lane one.
 
 The directives came during the hearing of a plea by the residents welfare associations of Vasant Vihar challenging PWD's decision to build a three-lane flyover parallel to the single-lane flyover on RTR Marg.
 
 On Wednesday the police also filed its report.
