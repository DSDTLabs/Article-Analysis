Bankruptcy wasnt a big deal, said rapper 50 Cent who has featured in an acting role in 'Den of Thieves'. "Bankruptcy wasn't a big deal for me. It was just me getting my discount. Reorganisation isn't broke, you know," 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, told. 

     




 The 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' hitmaker had filed for bankruptcy in Connecticut federal court in July 2015 shortly after a Florida woman named Lastonia Leviston won a $7 million verdict against him in Manhattan state court. But last year, he was discharged from bankruptcy after paying off a $22 million debt. Analysing fame and notoriety, he said it is a 'fair exchange for being able to do the creative things I want to do'. For the rapper, acting is an escape. "Acting allows me to be everything I'm not. It's the biggest escape possible. In music, you become the hit; you become the song you've created. It's like Mary J Blige. Her audience wants her to be in pain. When she's suffering, she becomes more likable to her audience. "For me, acting gives me the chance to break out of being me, to explore other parts of myself," he said.
