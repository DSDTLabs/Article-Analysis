With the ‘
 ’ pre-release event wrapped up, there is only one thing left to look forward to, and that is April 28, when the magnum opus will finally hit theatres. At the event, director   personally thanked his cast, crew, organisers and fans for their support. As if his vote of thanks at the event wasn't enough, he later took to Twitter to thank his workforce again. 

  
  
 Starting off by thanking the security team, he said, "Thank you G4S Hyderabad team for your excellent security services in handling the massive crowd in the most courteous manner." He went on to then thank the event managers for their "planning and execution which made the event so successful." 
 
 Moving on to thank his cast, he began with leading lady   saying, "Sweetu...thank u so much for your contribution to  . I believe all your fans will be even more enthralled with your presence in Part2." 
 
 He then went on to share a few heartfelt words about baddie   saying, "Rana I was surprised that I didn’t feel emotional on the last day of our shoot. Your speech yesterday triggered it and was like opening the floodgates of a dam. Will Miss you. Thanks a million for being my Bhallaladeva.”
 
 Finally he offered his gratitude to the star of the show   and said, "I am not able to frame my words for Prabhas here... my interviews will explain what he is to Baahubali... why he is BAAHUBALI.” 
 
 After such a long and epic journey of almost five years with the cast and crew, such an emotional goodbye was expected from the director. Meanwhile the music album of ‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ is out and is being received well so far.
