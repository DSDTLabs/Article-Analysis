AMARAVATI: Tension prevailed across the coastal districts on the eve of Chalo Amaravati   to be taken out by former minister and Kapu leader   on Wednesday even as the police left no stone unturned to foil the protest.

 The police have denied permission for the march and sealed the roads leading to Kirlampudi, the native village of the former minister. Heavy security has been arranged around the village and Padmanabham is not being allowed to come out of his house though the police is yet to declare that he is under house arrest.
 
 Kapu JAC convenor   told TOI that the   plan has not been withdrawn. “We have decided to go ahead with the programme from 9am on Wednesday. We shall continue the walk if allowed. We shall not use any force,” Yesudas said.
 
 He blamed the state government and the police for using force and arresting people across AP. “On the one hand, they say the Kapu movement has no mass support and on the other they have put up check-posts at several places to prevent Kapu leaders from taking part in the march. If there is no support for the movement, why are they arresting the leaders?” he asked.
 
 Meanwhile, the AP government has written to the   to speed up the process of submitting its report. The government wants the commission to clarify on the quantum of reservation to be given to the Kapu, Balija, Ontari and Telaga sub-castes by forming them into a separate group.
