MUMBAI: “If there is a sword of uncertainty over teachers and likelihood of them being transferred midterm, there would be no commitment to completing the course and would lead to a chaos,’’ said a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Riyaz Chagla of the   while asking the state to withdraw its decision to   primary schoolteachers following   of Thane district.

 State advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni got the state to withdraw a July 2016 resolution regarding transfers of teachers between Thane and   districts, thus averting possible chaos for 1,035 schools and 12,000 teachers. The HC said the state policy to transfer teachers only on seniority basis was ‘unsustainable’ and would have caused an imbalance and disrupted primary education in Thane and Palghar districts. The state has now held off transfers that followed bifurcation of Thane into two districts, till next academic year, in larger interest of students.
 
 A bunch of petitions before the HC by primary schoolteachers had challenged a change of policy by the state government following the 2014 bifurcation of Thane district into Thane and Palghar. Preeti Walimbe, the teachers’ lawyer, said the state had last July replaced a February 2016 decision which had maintained the strength and vacancy of reserved category teachers in Thane and Palghar rural districts.
