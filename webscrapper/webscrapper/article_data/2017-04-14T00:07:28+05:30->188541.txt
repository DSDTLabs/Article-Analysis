THANE: Prayers, penance and fasting will mark the solemn day of the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ on  .   will take part in the stations of the cross that will be held in churches across the city.

 The stations of the cross are a 14-step devotion that commemorates Jesus Christ’s last day on earth. This is followed by hours of silent praying and worship and mass in the evening.
 
 ‘‘There are 14 stations that highlight the crucial events that took place before the death of Jesus, including the time he was condemned to death, the times he fell with the cross, the moment he met his mother and so on. To remember these moments, we take a procession through our church and have 14 stops along the way representing these 14 stations. This traces the last steps of Jesus before his death—from the moment he was condemned to death till he was laid in the tomb,” said Linford D’Souza (41), a resident of Kharker Ali.
 
 Many keep an entire day fast on Good Friday and break the fast only on Saturday. ‘‘Some do not even drink a sip of water. Good Friday is termed good as it is the day Jesus Christ died for our sins,’’ said a resident of Ghodbunder Road.
 
 “Whether people have been keeping fast through out the lenten season or not, they observe it on Good Friday. We do not have any meat or fancy meals on this day. We mostly prepare kichdi or kanji and spend the entire day in prayer and worship. Some even refrain from watching television or movies and even listening to music. Confessions are also heard on this day,” said Alita Joseph (24), a resident of Hiranandani Meadows.
 
 After Good Friday, Catholics will celebrate the resurrection of Christ on Sunday.
