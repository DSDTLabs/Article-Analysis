GAYA: Alarmed by the deepening  , district magistrate Abhishekh Singh on Saturday cancelled the leave of all engineers concerned of the   (GMC) and PHED. No leave will be granted to the engineers of the two organisations associated with water supply till May 31, 2018.

 It may be mentioned here that monsoon reaches Gaya by the third week of June.
 
 The drastic step was taken by the DM following the review of the water scenario in the district, particularly Gaya town. During the review, it was found that leakages at several points in the water supply pipelines have added to the scarcity, as besides water going waste through the leakages, the pressure too gets significantly reduced thereby causing supply bottleneck. 
 
 According to the details of the review meet released by the district public relations officer N K Gupta, the DM was informed that one executive engineer, two assistant engineers and nine junior engineers are deputed at the Dandibagh water supply station. The DM wondered as to why despite the presence of so many technical personnel, the leakages were not being plugged.
 
 As per official records, water to Gaya town was supplied through 52 sources. While 45 sources of water supply are controlled by the GMC, the remaining seven sources are controlled by the public health and engineering department (PHED). In the action taken report, officials concerned explained that the two pumping machines of 50 HP capacity each has recently been installed at Dandibagh and one more 75 HP capacity machine would be installed in the next couple of weeks. 
 
 Illegal water tapping directly from Tower-bound rising pipes has also been identified as one of the major areas of concern. The DM directed the officials to come down heavily on people drawing water directly from the rising pipes.
