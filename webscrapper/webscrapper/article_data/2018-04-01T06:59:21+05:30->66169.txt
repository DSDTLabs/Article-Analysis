PANAJI: Goa Bachao Abhiyan ( ) has demanded the scrapping of the government’s planning and development authority (PDA) plans and drafting of a new horizon plan 2031 in the true spirit of 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, allowing villages and municipalities to plan for themselves.

 “By creating confusions about the part applicability of RP2021, town and country planning (TCP) department has selectively allowed piecemeal projects despite notifications, orders or circulars,”  , convener, and  , GBA general secretary said in a joint statement on Saturday.
 
 TCP minister   had recently announced that villages around the rim of   plateau would be dropped, while RP 2021 would be revived in terms of settlement areas.
 
 GBA stated that piecemeal attempts have bypassed due process and even 20% extra floor area ratio (FAR) has been auctioned under the budget head instead of planning. GBA also said that land-filling and hill-cutting continue despite 'stop work' orders being issued, but these are ineffective as they are neither punitive nor help restoration, as illegality continues. 
 
 “The PDA further seeks to decimate what is left of Goa's environment and the people's right to planning as enshrined in the Constitution. Villages under the regional plan are sought to be put under the outline development plan,” they alleged, adding that the new ‘One Goa’ plan should be attempted after all measures are in place.
