PUNE:   was drafted into India's   doubles team to partner Paes in the   I match against New Zealand here from Friday. Vishnu, 29, comes in as a last-minute replacement for  , who was ruled out due to a foot injury.

 Vishnu couldn't get a visa for this week's $25,000 ITF F2 Futures event in Kazakhstan. He had just finished his gym session at 9.30 pm in Hyderabad on Wednesday when he got a 'test' call from  . Paes said at a press conference that he wanted to call   straightaway when it became clear that Saketh would not be able to play. "But I was told not to call him," he said, refusing to elaborate further.
 
 India's non-playing captain   agreed that   was their first choice to replace Saketh and play the doubles rubber with Paes on Saturday.
 
 "Three persons spoke to Bopanna," said Amritraj, without willing to name them. "It's better to have someone (Vishnu) who wants to play," he added making it clear that Bopanna refused to join the team.
 
 Bopanna, who was forced to partner Paes against his wishes at the Rio Olympics last year, was not picked for the Davis Cup tie as India opted for three singles players as backup for reverse singles fatigue. The idea was to play one of them (Saketh, Yuki Bhambri or  ) with Paes in the doubles. But Saketh's injury disturbed the plan.
 
 Amritraj termed the incident as unfortunate and said they couldn't pick a doubles specialist as a backup and remain with the team. "Players want to play, they don't want to be in the reserves. They would rather go for ATPITF points on the tour rather than be with the team with only an outside chance to play."
 
 Bopanna had also missed India's World Group playoff against Spain last year when Paes and Saketh played. He had openly questioned his sacking from the Kiwi tie despite being India's best ranked doubles player at 28.Paes and Vishnu are ranked 64th and 338th respectively.
 
 Paes is set to play his record 55th doubles match.
