PATNA: The police have pressed 10 mine protected vehicles (MPVs) into service for Prakashotsava. Two guards armed with light machine gun (LMG) will be there atop the MPVs to keep constant vigil. One LMG guard is for backup in case the main guard is unable to perform his duty.

 While seven of the 10 MPVs have been brought from districts, the rest three were already with Patna police. At least 70 MPVs are in operation in Maoist-hit districts of the state. The 10 MPVs have been handed over to the special task force of Bihar police. These vehicles have been stationed between   and Patna Saheb.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said the MPVs have been deployed at Gandhi Maidan,   Link Path in Patna City and two other locations. “These vehicles could be used as shield and security personnel can be sent at required location to deal with any situation in case of attack as several non-specific threat warnings have been issued for Prakashotsava,” the SSP said. 
 
 Almost all available resources with the state are being used to avoid any untoward incident during the historic event.

DIG   said more than 50 fire tenders, including seven for Gandhi Maidan, four for Bypass tent city and three for gurdwara, have been kept ready. “If required, we would also contact Danapur cantonment and Patna airport to deal with any emergency situation,” Kumar said.
