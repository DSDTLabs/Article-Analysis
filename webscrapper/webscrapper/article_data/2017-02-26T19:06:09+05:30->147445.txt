The video song 'Thambiran' from the movie 'Ezra,' featuring   and Anu Seethal, is just out and the song is like no other!
 
  The track has a retro setting complete with a black and white film feel and yesteryear imageries, vintage get ups and music with a folk touch. Going by the story line of the song, it is from a flashback sequence of the movie. Sudev and Anu play characters who are in a relationship, and they seemingly belong to pre-independence era.
  
  The film has Prithviraj and   in the lead and the movie is directed by Jay K.
