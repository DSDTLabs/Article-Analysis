PUNE: The   in Pune is struggling to find a leader who can help the party make an impact in local politics. Former MLA and city unit chief Vinayak Nimhan had started his career with the party, but then joined the   only to return to the Sena. “There is a faith deficit when it comes to Nimhan’s leadership. Older Shiv Sainiks feel that a loyal partyman, and not a deserter, should have headed the city unit,” a former party corporator said. 

 For his part, Nimhan succeeded in showing the party’s united face to the voters, but the older Sena cadre did not cooperate with him, sources said. The old guard is now trying to come together under the leadership of veteran Shashikant Sutar. However, Sutar is yet to take a stand on this issue.
 
 A Sena loyalist said Uddhav Thackeray needs to pay attention to the party beyond Mumbai. “All these years, the Sena has failed to build a base in Pune city. Nimhan and his supporters have ruined the party,” he said.
 
 Nimhan said, “We accept the election results. Compared to the last polls, we have actually performed better. We stand united and will prepare for the assembly elections.” 
 
 In  , MP   and Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil are the face of the party while Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar and city president Rahul Kalate are leading their respective camps. Due to a strong leadership, the party could not put up a cohesive fight against the   and NCP.
