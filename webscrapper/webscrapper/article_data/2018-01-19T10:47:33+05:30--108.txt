LUCKNOW: The   government headed by Prime Minister   wants governors to be ambassadors of development and further the plans and programmes of the Central government in their respective states. A six-member committee of governors, set up after the two-day national conference of governors, recently submitted its report to the president stating that governors should be "vikas ke rajdoot" (ambassadors of development). 

 As per the new envisaged role, governors are supposed to interact with banks and other financial institutions to work for financial inclusion and ensure that tribals, dalits and women get   loans. They should also motivate youth to join  , and promote khadi, yoga, e-payments and cashless economy, skill development and   scheme. The governors should also foster co-operative federalism and oversee implementation of development programmes, particularly centrally-sponsored schemes, says the report a copy of which is with TOI.
 
 The report says   should have an action-outcome framework and contribute in furthering Central government's aim of establishing 'Swachch Bharat', 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat', 'Sushashit Bharat', 'Viksit Bharat', 'Swastha Bharat' and 'Shikshit Bharat'. It says that the governors should lay special emphasis on realizing the objectives of centrally-sponsored schemes and ensuring their successful implementation in state.
 
 It is for the first time that governors are being assigned an active role apart from discharging their constitutional responsibilities and duties as defined in the Constitution while exercising their powers as constitutional head of the state.
 
  Traditionally, governor acts as a constitutional head while all executive powers are vested with the chief minister, except in case of President's rule.
