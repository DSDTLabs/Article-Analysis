PUNE: Around 1,717 km from its “home” in Kashmir, saffron is blooming here. Scientists at the   ( ), Pune, have made what was once thought implausible, possible.

 The   of NCL studied the soil and climate requirements for cultivation of saffron in Kashmir and a 500sqft greenhouse was set up at NCL. Corms were procured from Kashmir and planted. They were cooled by natural processes and an irrigation method was devised to deliver cold water directly to the roots of the plants.
 
 With their efforts bearing fruit, scientists have turned their attention to cultivating saffron on a bigger scale — in a 5,000 to 10,000sqft greenhouse. They are also exploring places other than Pune, including Panchgani and Saputara, and also regions in the northern parts of the country to encourage progressive farmers and agri-biotech industries take up saffron cultivation.
 
 Saffron is known to be one of the most expensive spices in the world and it is picked from the dry stigma of the plant 'Crocus Sativus'. It is used for both culinary as well as medicinal applications. One gram of Kashmiri saffron is available for Rs 329 on e-commerce sites.
 
 Senior scientists C K John from the Biochemical Sciences Division started working on this project with three objectives in mind, including developing a biotechnological alternative, to produce a new variety of saffron suitable for wider environmental conditions and to standardize greenhouse cultivation of saffron outside the crop’s present natural area of growth (Jammu and Kashmir). The soil and environment requirements were addressed to grow saffron in a greenhouse at NCL.
 
 John said, "The idea was to take saffron out from Kashmir and give access to large number of farmers. Here, we have tried it on a smaller scale and hence the cost effectiveness could not be measured yet. However, when the cultivation is conducted on a larger scale the exact cost comparison can be worked out. Our prime aim was to cultivate it away from its natural region."
 
 The scientists have also tried to make the greenhouse very cost effective with low running cost, including electricity among others.
 
 "We will now be extending this field test on a bigger scale of about 5,000 to 10,000 sq ft area and to places that are naturally cold and where the difference in climate is not too much as compared to Kashmir. Areas around Panchgani, which are closer to Pune and also colder such as Saputara in Gujarat and also few northern regions that are equally cold can be ideal locations. We are trying it out at places where temperature goes down up to5 degrees during winter."
 
 The NCL scientists felt that the cultivation needs to be standardised in greenhouses and hence further research was required so that the commercial aspects can be worked out. John said that it would take a few more years to figure out where saffron could actually be cultivated commercially away from Kashmir. The NCL also has an intellectual property group and a business development group that would look into commercialisation of the idea in the next stages.
 
 
 
 
 
 How the scientists managed to cultivate saffron in Pune?
 
 -- The soil and environment requirements were addressed to grow saffron in a greenhouse in Pune.
 
 -- First, soil from a saffron field from Kashmir was studied for details and a suitable medium for planting was formulated.
 
 -- A modified greenhouse was established for cost reduction and energy saving. -- Saffron corns were procured from Kashmir and were planted in a Pune greenhouse cooled by natural processes, without a fan or air conditioning.
 
 -- A simple irrigation method was devised to minimize the use of water and give cold/ ice cold water directly to the roots as required.
 
 
 
 -- The challenge was to achieve production of big replacement corms which was dependent on healthy growth of plants till end of April and production of sufficient amount of starch in the leaves, and its translocation to the developing daughter corms.
 
 -- In the initial attempt, medium size replacement corms were produced. The corms once planted produce replacement corms and continue for 7-10 years; the corms from same greenhouse were used for replanting and surplus was used to consume.
 
 -- Flowering was synchronized as in Kashmir, but delay by two to three weeks was experienced.
 
 -- The stigmas were collected from the flowers and dried to produce saffron.
