RANCHI: The   government on Thursday zeroed in on 450 acres of land in three blocks of Ranchi district, to hand them over to prospective investors in the state. 

 Chief secretary Rajbala Verma took stock of a 250-acre plot in   of Namkum block and a 125-acre plot in Oremanjhi block, before distributing them to prospective investors from the textile and food processing sectors. Verma also inspected a 33-acre plot in   of Nagri block.
 
 Speaking to media persons, Verma said most of the identified land belong to the state government. “The government ensured that maximum amount of government land and minimum amount of Raiyyat land is acquired and used. If Raiyyati land is used, landowners will be paid four times the current market price of their land,” she said.
 
 The state industries, mines and geology department said land have been identified for creating a land parcel. “We are expecting investors to arrive next week. We will show them the land and hand it over to them accordingly,” a senior official in the department said. 
 
 Over 21 companies, which signed the memorandum of understandings (MoU) with the government during the two-day investment summit last week, will be allotted land for setting up their industries here.
 
 While the state government has resolved to build several units from the agriculture, food processing and textile sector in six months, however, according to sources, at least half the total earmarked land in Ranchi is unsuitable for use due of its rocky terrain. “It has to be levelled and prepared first. The access roads to these plots need to be built. It will take minimum of four to five months to make the plots ready for handing them over to the investors,” a source in the department said.
