Nagpur: The survey by state’s public works department (PWD) has revealed that 15 bridges in Nagpur and Gondia districts are in weak condition. Another 489 bridges in six districts of Nagpur division require repairing to some extent while 33 need expansion. Earlier, the PWD conducted only normal inspection of bridges before and after monsoon every year. Following Mahad bridge incident last year, the PWD thoroughly inspected 2,245 major bridges in the Nagpur division. PWD engineers carried out inspection and structural engineers were appointed wherever required. As per the data available with the PWD, there are 502 major bridges in Nagpur district, 252 in Bhandara, 267 in Gondia, 550 in Chandrapur, 328 in Wardha and 346 in Gadchiroli. Survey revealed that five bridges in Nagpur and 10 in Gondia were weak and require major repairing of pillars, carriageway, side railings, approaches etc PWD chief engineer of Nagpur Circle Ulhas Debadwar told TOI that a proposal seeking funds for carrying out repair works on these weak bridges has been submitted to the state government. “Estimates are ready. Estimates will be finalized and private contractors will be appointed for executing the works after government’s approval,” he said. Survey also pointed out that 33 bridges — 1 in Nagpur, 21 in Gondia, 4 in Gadchiroli and 7 in Bhandara districts — are “inadequate”, which means they need expansion. Minor repair works are required at 489 bridges, of which 103 are in Nagpur, 61 in Bhandara, 56 in Gondia, 162 in Chandrapur, 58 in Wardha and 49 in Gadchiroli districts. Of total 489 bridges, 31 require structural repairing. Of the 2,245 major bridges, 1,500 were found satisfactory by the engineers and do not require any action. Maximum 388 bridges are in Chandrapur, 293 in Gadchiroli, 270 in Wardha, 189 in Nagpur, 180 each in Bhandara and Gondia districts. Number of weak bridges and those require repairing may increase. The PWD has suggested structural audit of 48 bridges. Information related to remaining 160 bridges could not be known. Debadwar added minor repairing works on bridges will kick-off soon. “I have expedited process related to bridges after assuming charge as chief engineer at Nagpur circle. Works below Rs50 lakh have been sanctioned for bridges,” he said. There are two British era bridges in Bhandara district. They are on Nakadongri-Tumsar-Dewada-Sakoli state highway within a distance of 1km. One of them has been dismantled and construction of new bridge has commenced.
