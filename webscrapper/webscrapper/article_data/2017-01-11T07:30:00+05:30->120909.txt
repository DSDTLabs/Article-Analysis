CHANDIGARH: Fresh undated photographs of former SAD leader and Amritsar South MLA   with Canada-based wanted drug lord   surfaced outside Congress headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday, a day before the party is to announce 40 candidates for the February 4 polls.

 In one of these photographs, Bolaria is seen standing next to Satta, an Edmonton-based Sikh businessman.
 
 Satta’s name had figured as a drug dealer along with one Parminder Pindi alias ‘Uncle’ during the Enforcement Directorate’s interrogation of Arjuna Award winning former wrestler  , who was arrested in the Rs 6,000-crore synthetic drug scam in 2013.
 
 In another photograph, Bolaria’s brother-in-law Bir Devinder is also seen along with Satta.
 
 Bolaria maintained this was the handiwork of some mischievous elements to derail his campaign.
 
 “They can keep putting these old posters again and again. Neither was I summoned by the ED, nor was I questioned by any agency,” said Bolaria.
 
 “I am shocked that these Akalis can’t tolerate that I have quit them and they are scared of my popularity among youth. That is why they have held back only one seat that is Amritsar South to announce their candidate. They don’t have anyone who can contest against me and hence resorting to this tactics,” he added.
 
 SAD spokesperson   maintained they had nothing to do with Bolaria anymore as he was removed from their party a long ago.
