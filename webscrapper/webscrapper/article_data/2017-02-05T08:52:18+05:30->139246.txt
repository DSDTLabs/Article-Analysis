THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala   ( ) will organize a march from Ambalamukku to the residence of   principal   inside the college campus on Monday to protest against the caste discrimination and torture faced by the students.

 KPMS district president Cheruvakkal Arjunan criticized the delay in arresting Nair who had been accused of caste discrimination among students. “A case has been filed at the Peroorkada police station. The government is trying to sabotage the issue and take it for granted. The students from backward communities have been forced to serve food at her hotel. Despite receiving such serious complaints , police is not taking action,” he said, adding that authorities were delaying legal actions in order to help Nair flee the country and avoid arrest.
 
 KPMS is the third such organization to intervene in the issue after Veera Saiva Sabha and Samastha Nair Samajam.
