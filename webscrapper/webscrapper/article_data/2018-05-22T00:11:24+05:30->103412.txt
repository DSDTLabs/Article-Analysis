Nashik: The Mohinder Singh road in the Deolali camp area is likely to be opened to civilians soon as the defence ministry has decided to reopen all the closed roads in cantonments. The closure of the road by the local military authority in March 2016 brought great inconvenience to citizens as there are farms and burial grounds in the area.  Ajay Kumar, chief executive officer of the Deolali Cantonment Board, confirmed that the defence ministry has issued instructions to open the roads for public use and the local military authority has also been communicated about the same.  The CEO said the defence ministry was informed that the Mohinder Singh road was used by the public and hence it should be opened.  Board vice-president Dinkar Adhav said, “The roads were closed by the army on security grounds. The Mohinder Sing road was also closed by the army a couple of years ago, although there is private land, farms and a couple of burial grounds. We, along with MPs Hemant Godse and Harishchandra Chavan,were following up with the defence ministry.”  Adhav said the defence ministry had convened a meeting with the members of Parliament and elected vice-presidents of all the 62 cantonment boards in the country on May 4. “After discussing the issue, the defence ministry decided to give a serious thought and come out with a solution.”  The residents of the area said that they expect the road to open soon as it was causing inconvenience to people.  The residents said that the army was also preparing to close a road at Vijay Nagar in the Bhagur area and the road from Shigve to Barnes School. The residents said that they hoped that these roads were also not closed in the near future as the army was found making all preparations for the same.
