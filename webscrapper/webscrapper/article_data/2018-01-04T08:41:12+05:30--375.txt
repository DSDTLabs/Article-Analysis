THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has finally decided to intervene to sort out the issue that has led to the shortage of stents and other equipment in the   of the government medical college hospitals.

 Citing accumulation of arrears to the tune of Rs 61 crore for payment towards the equipment supplied, the distributors had stopped the supply of stents to the   and had warned of stopping the supply to Alappuzha and Kottayam medical college hospitals.
 
 
  
 
 This had led to severe shortage of the stents in the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital and had led to the stoppage of angiogram and angioplasty procedures. Even though the medical college authorities had released some funds to the distributors, they were insisting on clearing the entire dues.
 
 It is in this backdrop that additional chief secretary (health)   decided to hold discussions with the representatives of the chamber of distributors of medical implants and disposables on Thursday. The several rounds of talks the distributors had with the medical college authorities had not yielded any results.
 
 “We are going with a big hope that the issue will be settled. We need a substantial part of our dues to be cleared since we do not have money. No companies are providing us these implants and disposables on credit. We are obtaining them by paying ready cash. The hospital authorities are not realizing this,” said  , president of the chamber of distributors.
 
 However, the medical college authorities claim that they have released a partial amount to the distributors. “What we heard was Rs 1.25 crore was released and this is not enough for us. For a distributor who has to get Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore, getting Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh is not enough,” said Kumar.
 
 The   alone has to give Rs 15.42 crore to the distributors. This was the reason why they stopped the supply of stents and other equipment from December 15.
