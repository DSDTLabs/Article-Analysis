VISAKHAPATNAM: The groundwater table is declining fast in the outskirts of the city where there has been large-scale urbanisation and industrialisation. 

 Sources said people in these areas depend heavily on groundwater for their drinking water needs as the outskirt areas do not have sufficient supply facilities or distribution lines. Moreover, lack of rainfall is adding to the decline. 
 
 The groundwater levels at  , 20 km from the city, was 5.35 meters in February last year and now it has gone down to 8.83 meters. Levels in Anakapalli have also gone down from 3.48 meters to 4.25 meters. Pendurthi, Parawada and other areas have been maintaining the same levels. 
 
 “Even in areas which are in the middle of the city like   and  , there has been a decline in groundwater levels due to increasing density of population,” deputy director of groundwater department KN Sastry told TOI. 
 
 “A proper plan to manage the groundwater levels as well as to create awareness among the public is needed. Vizagites are lucky that the city can survive with the average groundwater levels because it is along on coast. All the upstream groundwater flows down to the coastal areas,” Sastry pointed out. 
 
 The   (GVMC) limits were also extended to Gajuwaka 12 years ago as well as Anakapalli and Bheemili three years ago to enable development in these areas.
