PANAJI:   traders shut shops in Goa on Saturday and demanded that the government should take over the task of transporting beef from Belagavi to the state. “The government should supply beef from the neighbouring state and we will sell it here. We don’t want to take any more risks,” Quraishi meat traders’ association member Anwar Bepari said.

 Animal husbandry and veterinary services minister Mauvin Godinho said he would discuss it with the chief minister and take a call by Monday. But the meat traders who met chief minister Manohar   on Saturday said the CM has said he would hold a meeting with police and officials concerned on Tuesday. “Until then, the strike will continue,” Bepari said.
