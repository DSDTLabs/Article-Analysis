Nagpur: A 32-year-old man has been arrested for duping several people to the tune of Rs11.29 lakh on the pretext of helping them withdraw money from ATMs.

 The accused, identified as Devnath Tumde, has been targeting lone ATM centres in rural parts of the district since November 1. He used to replace original ATM cards of people with fake ones.
 
 The crime branch confiscated 7 ATM cards of different banks, two mobile phones, a bike and cash totally worth Rs11.29lakh from him on Saturday.
 
 PI Sanjay Purandare told TOI, “Tumde used to stand outside the ATM centres and would offer help to withdraw amount to new users. After withdrawing the amount, he would exchange the card with a duplicate one.”
 
 He has duped people at Katol, Kalmeshwar, Saoner, Parseoni, Ramtek, Khaperkheda and Kelwad, he said.
 
 When police received several complaints of ATM frauds, they developed sketches of the suspect based on CCTV footage.
 
 Police said Tumde used the same modus operandi at every spot. It’s learnt that Tumde has hidden the large amount at his place.
