GUNTUR: Proving relief to farmers, the state government has de-listed   and fruit stocks from the   cess category. 

 The move is expected to help ryots sell their produce anywhere in the state. With market forces, particularly commission agents, influencing prices in the regulated markets, farmers often struggled to get remunerative prices. In fact, tomato growers throwing their dumping their produce during peak season has become a routine affair. During these events, farmers blamed the traders’ syndicate.
 
 After carefully studying the situation, the state government issued a GO de-notifying vegetables and fruits from   (agriculture produces and livestock) Act. “The de-notification will reduce the price gap between producers and consumers through reduction in intermediary supply chain and creation of alternative marketing channels,” said agriculture minister  . He said it would also promote investment on development of marketing infrastructure with private sector participation.
 
 The move is expected to bring down the prices in the retail market as growers are free to sell the stocks anywhere in the state besides enhancing farmers’ profit. The market yards, however, have been allowed to collect user charges from the buyers .
