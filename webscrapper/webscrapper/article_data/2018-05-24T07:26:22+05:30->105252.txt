PANAJI: A committee headed by the secretary of health was constituted on Wednesday to monitor the state’s preparedness in dealing with the   virus (NiV) that was detected in Kozhikode, Kerala. 

 “Not a single patient has been detected with symptoms in the state. There is nothing to worry about. Goans are safe,” health minister   said, adding that the state has received only a general advisory about the disease and interim guidelines, but no alert from the national centre for disease control.
 
 
  
 
 The directorate of health services on Wednesday also sent out a circular to all government clinics and hospitals, informing them about the disease, and providing them with the interim guidelines that have been sent to states on the virus. The hospitals have been asked to stay vigilant, and refer any suspected cases to   (GMC). Rane said advisories would be sent out to private clinics and hospitals as well.
 
 “Cases should be urgently investigated to rule out the prevalent causes of acute encephalitis before testing for Nipah virus disease,” the advisory states.
 
 The committee comprising the chief state epidemiologist, director health services, dean of Goa Medical College, deputy director health services, under secretary-I, under-secretary-II and the head of department of medicine, Goa Medical College, will be in charge of implementing guidelines if and when they come from Delhi, Rane said, adding that samples in suspected cases will be sent by GMC to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, Maharashtra.
