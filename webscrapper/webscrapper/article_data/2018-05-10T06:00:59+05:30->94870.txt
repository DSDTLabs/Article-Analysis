AHMEDABAD: Former   MLA  , who has ducked CID summonses twice, faxed CID crime and asked for time till May 11 or 12 to appear before them. However, Kotadiyaâ€™s letter to CID crime claims that Shailesh Bhatt is the real villain in the case and   has threatened to sit on hunger strike if action is not taken against Bhatt in 20 days. 

 Kotadiya has claimed that an offence of faking a cop had been registered against Bhatt. He stated that he has evidence to prove that Bhatt had extorted 2,300 bitcoins on February 1 and even transferred Rs 14.50 crore to Mumbai through an angadiya firm. 
 
 Kotadiya has even claimed that he had complained to the state home minister on February 24, 2018 but no action was taken. He has written that a senior politician is involved in the scam and that he fears being murdered or killed in an encounter as he has the evidence with him. 
 
 Kotadiya has claimed that several persons involved in the multi-crore   scam have fled outside the country and they should be brought back as lot of hard-earned public money has been siphoned off.
