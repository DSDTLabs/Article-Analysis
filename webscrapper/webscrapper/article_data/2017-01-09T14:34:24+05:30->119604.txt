For December 2016 central excise tax collection though rose 31.6 percent from December 2016, the growth is related to manufacturing. As for service tax collected in December 2016, that rose 12.4 percent compared with December 2015.

 From preliminary data available for November, the minister said that   collection from states also increased in November 2016, compared to the year-ago period. 
 
 "Another thing to remember, the collection estimate for November 2016 - when taxes could be paid in old currency - indicates that VAT must have been paid in old currency. So VAT collection is also up post  ," Jaitley said.
