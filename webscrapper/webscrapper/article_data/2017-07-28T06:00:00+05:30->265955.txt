Kolkata: In its bid to clear the rush hour logjam on Dimaond Harbour Road,   police on Thursday intermittently stopped Behala-bound vehicles before the Majerhat bridge approach to allow city-bound traffic to use both flanks of the bridge. 

 Craters and jutting tram tracks have slowed traffic flow on the Majerhat bridge to a trickle, leading to a trailing line of vehicles that extends to over a kilometre in the morning.
 
 DC (traffic) Solomon V Nesakumar said a similar experiment was being tried out on DL Khan Road where Alipore and Behala-bound vehicles are being stopped for longer periods than the average wait time at traffic signals to clear the bottleneck caused by vehicles approaching from the Bhawani Bhawan side. These steps, cops claimed, helped reduce travel time from Behala to the city centre. “We are witnessing huge snarls in the morning peak hours with around 15-20 minutes of dispersal time between Pathakpara and Mominpore. If the experiment succeeds, we plan to extend it to other roads,” said a southwest traffic guard official.
 
 Lalbazar has sent an SOS to KMC asking them to repair the Majherhat Bridge Road-Taratala flyover stretch on a priority basis. 
 
 “I have been posted in Behala for the past three years but I have not seen DH Road in such bad shape ever. The Metro work around the Mint and five days of incessant rain have led to water accumulation on the road. The blacktop has eroded and craters have shown up. Traffic flow has reduced by one-fifth per minute and this has affected roads like Burdwan Road, Belvedere Road and Alipore Road,” an officer said.
