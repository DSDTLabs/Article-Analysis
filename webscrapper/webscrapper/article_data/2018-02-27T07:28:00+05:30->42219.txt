 On February 3, the CBI had submitted the 80,000 page chargesheet against Hooda and 33 others into the alleged scam of release of 400 acres, out of 912 acres land, which was supposed to be acquired for the Industrial Model Township (IMT) of Manesar.
 
 Besides Hooda, prominent among those named in the chargesheet included his former principal secretaries M L Tayal, Chhatar Singh, former bureaucrat S S Dhillon and former Gurgaon DTP   and 29 others who included officials and builders who were benefitted in this alleged scam.
 
 In its voluminous chargesheet, CBI had elaborated on how farmers were forcefully made to sell their land or enter into agreements with companies after the government initiated land acquisition proceedings in three villages falling under Manesar block of Gurgaon.
 
 Later, in 2006, the delayed release of compensation led to lapse of land acquisition proceedings.
