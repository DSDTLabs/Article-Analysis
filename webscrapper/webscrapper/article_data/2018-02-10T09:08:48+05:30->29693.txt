NAGPUR: In a move that could surprise chess masters from across the country, a selection tournament to pick the top four players attracted just 12 entries in Nagpur.

 
 Friday saw a new low for   (NDCA) as the district body failed to attract enough participation from women chess players of the city.
 
 To select the best players from the city for the forthcoming state chess selection tournament, the NDCA organized a women chess selection chess tourney at the Dhanwate National College Sports Complex here from Friday.
 
 With mere 12 entries, the arbiter was forced to finish the event in just four rounds. Organizing secretary of the NDCA Umesh Panbude tried to analyze the reason and said, “It is very surprising that a selection tournament failed to find participants. Since the meet is open to all, the parents of young players might not have allowed their kids to play.”
 
 He added, “Another reason for players to skip the district meet could be the direct entries that players get in the state tournament. But the state body has increased the fees for direct entries and that might hurt these players. The 12 entries is a real low as earlier at least we have seen a participation of 20-25 players.”
 
 Nagpur will also play host to the state selection tournament next month and as per the new regulations the NDCA will collect hefty fees from those seeking direct entries.
 
 The second round saw Sakshi Lanjewar script first upset of the meet when the lower ranked defeated second seed Aashi Dalal. All the other rated players posted easy victories to move up.
