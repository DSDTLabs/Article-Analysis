MUMBAI: On Wednesday, TOI had reported that the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) for the  , in its meeting on April 12, had doubled the fee of umpires, curators, match referees, scorers and video analysts in domestic cricket.

 
 On Thursday, former BCCI secretary  , while welcoming the CoA’s move, has criticized the decision to pay the umpires more than even the domestic players. As per the minutes of the CoA meeting, which were released on Wednesday, the match fees the umpires officiating in senior tournaments (other than T20) has been raised to Rs 40,000 per day for the top 20 umpires, and Rs 30,000 per day for the remaining umpires.
 
 “It is a welcome idea to raise the match fees of the umpires and other match officials, but it is indeed shocking and surprising that the recommended match fees of umpires would be higher than the domestic senior player, which is Rs 35000 per day. I fail to understand that how can the match fee of the umpires be more than that of the players?” he questioned.
 
 He lamented that the “domestic players have been much-ignored since the last couple of years. Domestic Cricket is most important and a reliable platform of getting players for international tournaments. All the associations put in a lot of effort for their respective domestic teams for all tournaments of the BCCI. But due to reasons unknown to many of us, the domestic players are being ignored.”
 
 He pointed out that “since last domestic season, i.e. 2017-18, each team is getting two less league matches than the earlier format of the Ranji Trophy, which is causing a considerable financial loss to the players.”
 
 Meanwhile, the CoA’s decision to explore the possibility of India’s senior and junior national coaches (  &  ) commentating in the   in future, by making a submission in regard to the 'conflict of interest' policy in the SC hasn’t gone down well with the members too.
