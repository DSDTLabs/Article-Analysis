JAIPUR: Be it the recent historic judgment banning triple talaq or the bills of national importance such as the Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance or the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Jaipur lad Devansh Kaushik was equal to the task while taking the national level entrance   of the National Law University in Delhi. When the results were announced on Thursday evening, he stood first, scoring 98.25 marks out of 150 and leaving behind the second rank holder who managed only 84.

 Having aspired to join the league of most argumentative Indians, Kaushik began preparing for a robust career in law from Class IX. “I was clear about pursuing a career in law or judicial services from my junior classes,” said an elated Kaushik.
 
 He scored 10 CGPA in Class X and had no interest in any of the three streams—humanities, commerce and arts. “You don’t require a particular stream to appear for CLAT or any other law entrance test. So, I reached the conclusion that the commerce stream would give me ample time to prepare for the entrance exam. It worked for me,” said Kaushik.
 
 His plan to thoroughly study recent judgments related to PILs and bills paid him rich dividends. “I evaluated papers from previous years and found that there was more focus on current legal affairs. This helped me to shift focus. I started scanning every possible judgment by the supreme and high courts of national importance. From reading lengthy judgments to watching TV debates and reading analysis in law magazines to discussing them with teachers, I tried to get a clear understanding of matters. This helped in cracking many questions,” said Kaushik, a student of the Cambridge Court High School in Jaipur. He did take considerable risk by ignoring 18 questions. “It was a very calculated risk. I was aware that if my answer was wrong, I would be severely punished as the paper has negative marking. I didn’t attempt questions which I was not 100% confident about,” said Kaushik.
