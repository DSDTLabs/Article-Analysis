MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has directed the Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department to open the lock of the Madurai   for maintenance of shops there. It also strictly said that the shopkeepers may only maintain their shops and not run the business there.

  heard a batch of cases filed by many shopkeepers from temples administered by the HR&CE in several districts including Trichy, Ramanathapuram and Madurai. 
 
 The counsel appearing for the shopkeepers of Pudhumandapam expressed the need to open the shops by saying that many perishable items have been housed in the shops, which needed to be maintained.
 
 To this, the special government pleader (SGP) explaining the HR&CE’s stand told the court that alternate sites are available only for shopkeepers of two temples – Sankaranarayanar and   – situated in   district. 
 
 He added that no alternate sites are available for shopkeepers of other temples – Thayumanavaswamy temple in Trichy, Andal temple in Virudhunagar, Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram, Thiruparankundram Subramaniaswamy temple in Madurai.
 
 However, the court directed the HR&CE to open the lock of the Madurai Pudhumandapam. The court also said that its interim injunction restraining the HR&CE from evicting shopkeepers from the temples in the districts concerned would continue till then.TNN
