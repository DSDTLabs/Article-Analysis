MADURAI:   M Karunakaran has written to the chief secretary recommending the formation of an   to conduct a scientific study into the availability of water in the  . This follows the uproar regarding supplying Tamirabarani water to two multinational soft-drink companies Pepsi and Coca Cola in times of drought. 

 In the communication dated April 24, Karunakaran said that the CPM had announced a protest against the two soft-drink firms, as they claimed it was unfair to continue to supply them water at a time when two districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin, dependant on Tamirabarani river, were facing acute water scarcity. 
 
 The collector said that the CPM had opposed the submission by the district administration in the Madurai bench of the Madras high court where it had stated that excess water was available in the river and that the two companies could draw water from it. 
 
 He further stated that supply of water to the firms was stopped immediately based on the court order dated November 21, 2016 and that water had not been given even after the court said that two companies could be given the same till April 30. Also, taking into account the drought situation, all water supply from the river was stopped to all industries in the district from May 1 to May 31.
 
 The protestors had also stated that water should not be supplied to industries which used water as a basic raw material, as many town panchayats and panchayats were receiving water supply only once in seven or ten days. They had stated that the term, "surplus water'' could not be accepted when agricultural and public demand were taken into account.
 
 Though the World health organization had specified that a person should be given 150 liters per day, an individual in the municipalities in Tirunelveli received only 90 liters, 70 liters in town panchayats and 40 liters in village panchayats.
