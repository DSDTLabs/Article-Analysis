There’s been a lot of buzz around the news of soccer star Ronaldinho’s plans to marry two women at the same time. While he went on to slam the reports, closer home actor   was quite amused as he found the whole episode similar to his show ' '. “I found the initial reports on Ronaldinho’s plans to marry two women at the same time, really funny. And then it struck me that it is similar to the show’s story of a guy living with two wives in the same house. Seemed like the soccer star was inspired by the show,” quips the actor, who made his entry in the show recently. “I am joking, it is not a comment on the show or the soccer player,” he added.

 The show is all set to go off air by the end of the month. Ask Iqbal if he is disappointed and he said, “I was supposed to do a cameo like   did in ' '. I enjoyed my time on the set; it was a happy experience. If we knew the magic formula of earning good ratings, then we would all be churning out great shows every day. In fact, some of the most bizarre tracks on TV shows have done well, while makers, who attempted to do something different, have not been able to make it on the charts. While TV shows are being made for the same audience, what the makers are not understanding is that the audience’s taste is changing. Understanding these changes is more important than attempting something different.”
