Indore: Indoreans continued to experience a pleasant   in the morning and evening as overcast skies brought relief from the heat of the sun on Wednesday also. 

 The city witnessed overcast for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday. However, no rainfall was recorded in Indore while the neighbouring areas witnessed mild showers during the evening time. 
 
 The maximum temperature on Wednesday was recorded as 40.5 degree Celsius, which was normal. The minimum temperature slided down to 23.8 degree Celsius as the minimum temperature from the past few days was hovering around 25 degree Celsius. The Met officials said that the same scenario of cloudy sky would continue for the next two to three days. 
 
 “The weather will come to normal in the next two to three days with temperature rising once again in the city. The effect of the trough line over MP due to the upper air cyclonic circulation over UP will be fading off gradually,” said an official from the Met observatory in Indore. 
 
 However, the residents were seen enjoying the change in the weather while the two wheeler riders were seen struggling with the dust due to the winds in the evening time. “I wish the weather to remain the same for some more days. Though it was quite hot in the afternoon but the pleasant weather in the evening while returning from work had uplifted my mood and I enjoyed riding back to home,” said Pratap Rajput, a working professional from the city. 
 
 The city experienced relative humidity of 47% in the morning and 20% in the evening. With the change in weather, the Met officials are expecting above average rainfall in the state this year as the pre-monsoonal activity start off early this year in the state. 
 
 Officials said initial forecast underlines that monsoon would be about 95% this year. However, things would get clear as monsoon advances further towards the central parts of the country.
