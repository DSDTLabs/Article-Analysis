Angie Thomas' ground-breaking Young Adult (YA) novel inspired by the   movement has won this year's Waterstones Children's Book Prize. 

 Thomas won the Â£5,000 award for her debut work of fiction, 
 , that talks about the life of a teenage girl who witnesses a brutal police shooting of her unarmed best friend, a young black boy. 
 
 The title of the book is also inspired by a phrase the famous rapper Tupac Shakur used to generate the acronym THUG.
 
 The book gained widespread popularity and critical acclaim for its relevance in the Black Lives Matter movement. A movie version starring Anthony Mackie and rapper Common is now in production. 
 
 Thomas' book was originally written as a short story with the same title 
 . It was actually inspired by a real-life police shooting in 2009. 
 
 "I want to help people understand why we say black lives matter," the author told BBC Breakfast last year.
 
 Waterstones' Managing Director James Dunt said, "
 should have a readership far beyond a core audience of young adults." He added, "Ours is a children's prize, but there is no upper age limit to being stunned by beautiful writing of this visceral power."
 
 The YA book also beat two other category winners to this year's prize, which was presented by Children's Laureate Lauren Child at a gala ceremony in London.
 
 In the younger fiction category, 
 by Australia's   came top, while the prize for this year's best illustrated book went to 
 by Joe Todd-Stanton.
