Ahmedabad: A clerk of the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) allegedly threatened an dalit activist not to file petitions regarding ‘human rights violation’. However, the activist lodged a complaint against the clerk himself and sought departmental action against him.

 Mehsana-based dalit rights activist, Kaushik Parmar, the complainant, alleged that the SHRC clerk Murti (full name not kown) misbehaved with him when he went to check the status of his several petitions on human rights violations.
 
 As per the complaint, the incident occurred on March 14, when Parmar went to the SHRC office in Gandhinagar to know the status of his various complaints regarding social boycott of dalit community members in different villages of the state.
 
 When he approached a clerk in legal department of SHRC, the clerk allegedly threatened Parmar that it was not his right to file complaint in SHRC and he should stop filing such complaints.
 
 The complaint reads, “When I went to the clerk, who was being addressed as Murti, to rectify a mistake in my petition, he became furious and told me that you frequently file petition in SHRC, stop making false petitions. He used derogatory words for me and misbehaved with me. He also said that why I am doing social activism and imposing my petitions on SHRC. He also said that only MPs and MLAs can file petition in public interest, not an activist.”
