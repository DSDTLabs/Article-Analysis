PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Opposition Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has demanded the resignation of   MLAs and office-bearers of   ( ) for failing to honour promises made during assembly and municipal elections.

 Yogesh  , opposition leader, PCMC said, “No effort has been made by the civic office-bearers and MLAs to obtain permission from the state irrigation department to get 167 million litres a day (MLD) water from Bhama Askhed and another 100 MLD from   dams to meet the future drinking water requirements in Pimpri Chinchwad.” 
 
 “The BJP had promised that they will abolish penalty on unauthorised constructions in 100 days after coming to power in PCMC. But these promises have remained unfulfilled. So the MLAs and civic office bearers of PCMC belonging to BJP must apologise to the people and submit their resignations.”
 
 “Many parts of the city do not receive adequate water supply so we are opposed to the hike in water tax,” said Behl. 
 
 “The civic office bearers and MLAs of ruling BJP should have obtained permission from the state government for restarting work on the stalled Pavana dam-Nigdi water pipeline work but no progress has been made even after the BJP government came to power in PCMC as well in the state,” he added.
 
 He said that if civic officials demolish unauthorised construction at the plinth level it will instil fear among people that they must not indulge in illegal activities. 
 
 Instead, the officials wait for the building to be constructed three-four storied and then go for demolishing the building, he said.
 
 He said that the civic administration was discriminatory towards ruling party members. Constructions undertaken by ruling party workers or those close to the ruling party are not demolished, Behl alleged. 
 
 He also alleged that the ruling BJP has not proposed any big new civic project in the draft budget of 2018-19. 
 
 The BJP has only completed the projects started by NCP and inaugurated them in past one year.
