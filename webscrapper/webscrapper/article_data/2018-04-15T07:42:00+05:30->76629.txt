GURUGRAM: A 35-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing his wife following a   at their Sare Homes flat in Sector 92.

 Police said Hariom, who owns a computer repair shop, strangled Luxmi (32) to death apparently when she was sleeping late on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning, when Luxmi’s father   visited their house, he found her lying on a bed with Hariom sitting near the body.
 
 Singh then called police and got him arrested. Hariom was produced in a city court that sent him to two-day police remand on Saturday.
 
 Luxmi, originally from Nawada Fatehpur village, got married to Hariom, of Mumtaz Nagar village, around 11 years ago. The couple was living in Sector 92 while their two children — an eight-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son — are studying in a boarding school in Kurukshetra. Hariom used to run a computer repair shop in IMT-Manesar and Luxmi was a homemaker.
 
 According to Luxmi’s father, the couple used to fight regularly, even over minor issues. The family members tried to resolve their differences several times but in vain.
 
 The two apparently fought again on Wednesday night. After the fight when Luxmi went off to sleep, Hariom allegedly strangled her. Incidentally on Thursday morning, Singh called them but neither Luxmi nor Hariom received his calls. Worried, he rushed to their flat and found his daughter dead.
 
 Based on Singh’s complaint, an FIR has been registered against Hariom under Section 302 ( ) of the IPC at Sector 10A police station. 
 
 “Prima facie it appears the man killed his wife in a fit of rage,” said SI Dinkar Yadav, the investigating officer.
