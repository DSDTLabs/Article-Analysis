KOCHI: The issue of unlicensed catering units recently came to the fore after a caterer failed to deliver the order for a marriage much to the dismay of the bride's family. 

 
 There was no food when the guests reached the   for lunch. When the family tried to reach the caterer, who had collected Rs 50,000 in advance, his mobile was switched off. 
 
 Then the family contacted helpers who informed that the caterer did not ask them to prepare food. The incident served as a warning to people to stay clear of unlicensed caterers.
 
 One major reason why people hesitate to go for licensed caterers is the additional expense incurred by GST. "The introduction of 18% GST on licensed caterers has forced people to look for unlicensed caterers. They are not willing to pay such a huge amount as tax. Earlier, it was only 5% and that was acceptable to most. Now the competition is between those who pay 18% tax and those who pay 0%." said V K  , district president of All Kerala Caterers' Association.
 
 Procuring services of unlicensed caterers have another risk. "In the case of, say, food poisoning, the client who availed the services from the unlicensed caterer will be responsible and not the caterer. Catering licence puts the responsibility of food safety on the catering service and therefore it's crucial that people inquire about the license before giving the order." Varghese added.
 
 Meanwhile, the food safety board will be tasked with ensuring that such practices don't recur. 
 
 "The food safety board serves notices asking caterers to obtain licence. If they continue to function without licence, then a case against them could be filed," said  , assistant commissioner of food safety, Ernakulam district.
