MARGAO: A private taxi carrying three Swedish tourists to Dabolim international airport crashed into an electricity pole and knocked down an elderly pedestrian near the South Indian Bank on the busy Abade Faria Road, Margao, on Sunday.

 While the elderly woman received minor injuries, the foreign tourists, who were visibly shaken by the accident, quickly called another cab and left for their destination. 
 
 The mishap resulted in a minor traffic jam on this narrow stretch that is used by vehicles heading towards Panaji.
 
 Witnesses, including the TOI correspondent, tried calling the police who took about half-an-hour to reach the spot that is barely 100 metres away from   police station. 
 
 While senior police officials like SP   and Margao Town PI   were quick to respond to the distress calls,   DSP (traffic) Prabodh Shirvoikar and Margao PI (traffic) Mohan Gawde failed to reply.
 
 Patil told TOI, “Because of the upcoming election, we are facing an acute staff crunch, as well as shortage of vehicles. Hence, we are unable to respond quickly to such emergencies.”
