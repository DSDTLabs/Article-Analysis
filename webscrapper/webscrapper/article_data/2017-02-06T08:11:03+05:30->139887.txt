NEW DELHI: A special court held a former   and his wife guilty of amassing   worth Rs 72 lakh and sentenced them to a year in jail in a 16-year-old case. 

 A case was registered against   and his wife Urmil, a TGT teacher with the directorate of education, by the CBI under sections of the   1988 and the IPC. The probe agency had claimed that during a raid on the couple’s residential premises at Vasant Kunj in August 2000, assets around Rs 80.42 lakh disproportionate to their known sources of income were found. 
 
 Special judge Vinod Kumar said it appeared that Sehrawat and his wife had started laundering unlawful money in a “calculated manner” by carefully showing it in the ITRs and by creating necessary paperwork. 
 
 “I hold that the accused were having assets disproportionate to the tune of Rs 72 lakh, as compared to their known sources of income,” the court said, while directing confiscation of the amount from the convicts.
 
 Sehrawat claimed the assets were bought out of compensation received after his father’s land was acquired by the government. On his father’s advice, he had also started a part time property business. His wife claimed that she had received sufficient stridhan at the time of marriage and the properties she had purchased were from her own sources of income.
