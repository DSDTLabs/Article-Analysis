Tuticorin: Tired of making repeated representations and appeals to the district administration, state highways department and town panchayat   and traders of Udankudi town in Tuticorin district have decided to collect money by begging, from the traders and residents of the town, to lay roads.

 “State highway connecting Udankudi with Thisayanvilai is in worst condition. There is literally no road for more than 100 meters in the Main Bazaar, which is the most important place in the town that has a population of more than 30,000 people” says activist V Gunaseelan.
 
 He said that the roads have been badly damaged since the heavy rains in 2015. “In addition to petitioning the collector and other officials concerned, residents and traders have staged various demonstrations over the years,” he said.
 
 In one of the protests Tiruchendur MLA Anitha Radhakrishnan participated. Following the protest, state highways department officials finally agreed to relay the road and had even claimed that the tender was floated to relay the road. Two months ago traders downed shutters for a day to condemn the officials for not mending the roads.
 
 “The highways department then laid some gravel on the portion and have not completed the work. Motorists falling down are a common sight every day. The town panchayat has also not mended the damaged roads. So on Saturday, social activists and a few political parties have decided to beg to collect money and lay the roads,” said Gunasekaran.
 
 They said that they would wait for the district administration and officials concerned to begin work in a week, else shame the government by going ahead with their begging. “If the government is not interested in meeting our basic requirement, we will do it on our own,” the activist added.
