Coimbatore: All communities should come together and conduct discussions to check the increasing attacks on dalits and adivasis, Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale said here on Saturday.

 “Atrocities against dalits and adivasis happen in all states irrespective of which party is ruling. This can be solved only by making all communities sit together and talk rather than politicising the issue,” Athawale told TOI.
 
 The minister was in the city to address a conference on ‘Thoughts of Dr B R   and its Relevance to Contemporary Society’ held at the Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women. 
 
 He asked the students of the institute to marry out of their caste, which was the only way to eradicate caste from the society.
 
 When asked about the issue of honour killings, Athawale told TOI that about 50,000 inter-caste marriages happen in the country every year. “Honour killings happen only in some cases. Those facing such a situation should be given police protection,” he said.
 
 Earlier in his address, Athawale said the most important contribution of Ambedkar was to lay emphasis on fundamental rights as a means to protect and empower the minorities. He added that only after achieving social justice, economic and developmental goals can be achieved.
 
 Speaking about BJP’s victory in Tripura and Nagaland, Athawale said the victory was historical and proved the efficient leadership of  . “It is an indication that the   will win the 2019 Lok Sabha election,” he said.
 
 Speaking at a press conference in another part of the city, Athawale said TTV Dhinakaran should join the EPS-OPS camp and become a minister. 
 
 “Dhinakaran, along with EPS-OPS camp, should come forward to support NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Only then   would be able to fully implement late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s policies,” he added.
