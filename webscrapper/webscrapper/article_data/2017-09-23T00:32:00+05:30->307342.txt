Namakkal: Transmigration of souls is a common belief in many cultures, more so in villages. Natives of Alankadupudur Odaikkadu village near Tiruchengode in   district witnessed a queer phenomenon at the funeral of an aged farmer on Friday.

 After K Marimuthu, 80, breathed his last on Thursday, the body was kept in his house for people to pay their respects. As relatives and other villagers streamed in, a   suddenly turned up and stood firm near the body, ignoring people’s attempts to shoo it away. 
 
 “We were awed when it remained near the body though we tried to chase it away,” said M Vasantha, 48, a relative of Marimuthu’s wife, Ponnu Pappu. “We just sat there observing the crow,” she said.
 
 Villagers began to recall how devoted Marimuthu and Ponnu Pappu were to each other. They had two daughters and lived a contended life. The couple were always seen together. 
 
 Marimuthu was shattered when Ponnu Pappu died of illness on Puratasi 5 (Tamil month) in 2012. “After her death, my grandfather felt so helpless and lonely,” said K Sathya, his granddaughter. Marimuthu, who fell ill a few days ago, died on the same ‘Puratasi 5’, five years later. 
 
 When the relatives placed Marimuthu’s body on a rope cot, the crow came in and circled it for a while. It then sat underneath the cot and remained thus for more than four hours. When the relatives took the body to the burial ground, about 3km away, the crow again sat on the stretcher on which Marimuthu’s body was placed.
 
 “We were all awe-struck,” said Vasantha. “The crow stayed with the body throughout the procession until the burial ground.”
 
 After reaching the burial ground, Marimuthu relatives performed the final rites and prepared to bury his body. “But the crow refused to budge. When we persisted, it flew to a nearby tree branch and sat there watching the proceedings,” said T Sakthivel, another relative. The astonished villagers have nothing else to talk about since then.
