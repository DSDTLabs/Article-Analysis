LUCKNOW: Elections for 13 seats of UP legislative council will be held on April 26, the   announced on Monday evening. The commission will formally announce the notification on April 9. The last date of filing nomination will be April 16. 

 The announcement came about 10 days after the BJP registered a win against the opposition candidate in the   elections in UP. Of the 13 council seats which will fall vacant on May 5, seven belong to the SP, two each to BSP and BJP and one to RLD. Those retiring from the seats include SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, SP chief spokesperson  , and UP ministers Mohsin Raza and  .
 
 Given the strength of UP assembly, a candidate will need at least 29 votes to win. The BJP led NDA, which has a strength of 324 MLAs, can easily win 11 seats with five votes to spare. The SP, with 46 MLAs (  has defected to BJP), on the other hand, can comfortably win one with 17 votes to spare. All eyes will be on the 13th seat for which SP and BSP can come together to field a joint candidate. The BSP, which has 18 MLAs (Purwa MLA Anil Singh switched over to BJP in RS), cannot win a single seat on its own. Political circles are abuzz about the SP supporting the BSP candidate. Name of BSP's RS nominee, Bhimrao Ambedkar, who was also the joint opposition candidate, is already doing the rounds for MLC elections. 
 
 BSP chief   had announced that she would support SP in council elections if her candidate won the RS elections. At present, SP enjoys majority with 61 legislators in the upper house of UP assembly. Its number will, however, come down by six. The BSP will also have its strength reduced with the retirement of two members. BJP, which has 13 legislators in the upper house, will have its tally rise from nine to 21. 
 
  RLD will lose its presence in the house with the retirement of its lone MLC Chaudhary Mushtaq.
