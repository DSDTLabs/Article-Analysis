AJMER: District administration on Monday razed down three houses at   under heavy police protection to make way for  . The Dhani is only settlement left on the way of Ajmer-Kisengarh Airport. The action followed after reported warnings by police to vacate their houses as they already got compensation from the government.

 Villagers of Rathoron ki Dhani have been agitating since last two years as they were demanding hefty compensation to vacate their houses for airport construction. The absence of land acquisition is hampering one part of the runway leading to delay in construction.
 
 Looking to the delay in starting airport, the administration decided to forcefully remove the villagers, “Heavy police was deployed today in morning when one community hall and two more houses were broken,” added police. There were some more houses remained in the village who have been warned to clear within two-three days.
 
 Government claimed to have already paid the compensation to the villagers but the dispute remained as people were demanding compensation for village temple, situated on government land.
 
 “The temple was on government land and even though administration was ready to pay the compensation for it, but it asked to form a committee for getting compensation so that the committee could construct the temple again in relocated place,” said an official.
 
 But there were personal claims by many people to construct the temple and therefore the dispute lasted for many days, “There were people who demanding compensation on the land they encroached and government was not ready for that,” added a source.
 
 The matter worsened when someone set fire on some bushes near the village and rumour of police set them on fire spread. “We detained many people in this matter,” added police. Administration source assured that the place will be totally vacated in next few days to develop the airport.
