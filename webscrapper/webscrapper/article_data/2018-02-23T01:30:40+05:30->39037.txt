NEW DELHI: A busy stretch of   was barricaded for nearly three hours on Thursday after supporters of a labour union gathered near   and threatened to march to the  . 

 
 The police were caught unawares due to which they had to block a part of the road. They said the protesters were contained at the park for some time before being dispersed. The move, however, stalled traffic at the intersection till late. 
 
 The group led by the labour wing of Communist Party of India had reached Delhi Gate around noon. But when the police stopped them from going towards the secretariat, they went for a sit-in   at the park. Though there was no permission for it, both the police and civic bodies were reluctant to act against the protesters. 
 
 The congested area where many offices are located is already a parking nightmare. Last November, a similar protest had led to a five-day stand-off between police and protesters. 
 
 Senior police officers said people protesting peacefully cannot be evicted unless they try to erect blockades or violate prohibitory orders. They said the protesters had initially promised a gathering of a few hundred people. But it swelled in just a few hours. This led to snarls that choked the ITO crossing and took more than an hour to normalise. Office-goers had to drive on the wrong side of the lane to find parking spaces. 
 
 Police had earlier planned to turn the two-way stretch between Hamdard Chowk and Turkman Gate into a one-way route. 
 
 Traffic going towards Desh Bandhu Gupta Road was diverted to Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, which runs parallel to Asaf Ali Road.
