VIJAYAWADA: The death of   legislator   has opened a debate in political circles over which party will field a contestant in the impending by-election. 

 Major political parties in state follow the tradition of leaving a seat uncontested to a family member of a deceased leader. Nagi Reddy technically belongs to YSRC, even though he had switched loyalties to TDP.   had been demanding that all turncoat legislators, including Nagi Reddy, quit and face by-elections. Thus, they are reportedly considering filing its candidate citing that the seat belongs to the party.
 
 On the other hand, TDP might try to prevail upon one of Nagi Reddy’s children to take a plunge into active politics to fill the vacuum. It might then try to persuade the opposition to follow the tradition of not fielding any candidate against them.
 
 In keeping with the tradition, the TDP had not fielded a candidate when bypolls were held after the death of Sobha Nagi Reddy’s death in a road accident in 2014. She was a YSRC leader and her daughter, Akhilapriya won the seat in the by-election as a YSRC candidate and is the Allagadda MLA. It remains to be seen if any of the couple’s other two children are willing to join politics.
 
 “It is too early to discuss the issue. We will take a call when needed,” a senior YSRC leader said. He, however, said that it might not be wise to field a candidate in case someone from the Bhuma family is contested the by-election.
 
 Sources said that TDP is expected to field its local strong man Silpa Mohan Reddy in case none from the Bhuma family enters the fray. He had lost the previous election to Nagi Reddy with wafer thin majority.
