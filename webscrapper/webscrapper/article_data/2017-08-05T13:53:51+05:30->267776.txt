Ali Asgar is now a part of 'The Drama Company' with   and  , but even today the one question he is often asked is why he left  's comedy show. "I was not happy with the way my character shaped up, it had no definition. I felt people at some point would get bored watching me play grandmother and I had to do something else. I would get little to do in the last few minutes of the episode. In the last over of a match, when two balls are remaining and you ask the batsman to hit 12 runs, how is that possible? I continued with it for a year and then I decided to plan my exit. Around that time, the unfortunate incident on the flight from Australia happened (Kapil abused   and  ), which further fuelled the exit."
So, will he never work with Kapil again? "Maine koi kasam nahi khayi uske saath nai kaam karne ki. He was the captain of the ship where I used to work. That project did not work out, thatâ€™s it," he says.
