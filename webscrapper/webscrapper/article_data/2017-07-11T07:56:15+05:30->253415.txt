CHENNAI: The expansion of the   is making it the preferred choice for many   and students who are increasingly using it as a   to reach their final destinations. With the   cutting down on travel time even if it can be used only for a portion of the journey, commuters are making a beeline to metro stations by using different modes of transport such as buses, autos or bikes.

 The number of commuters has increased by about 70% after the line was opened to Anna Nagar. Before the inauguration of the underground line, each station roughly saw about 1,750 commuters every day. But after the launch in May, the numbers have gone up to about 3,000 commuters per day, said a metro rail official.
 
 Abiranjani S, an architecture student residing in Besant Nagar, said she started using the metro only after it was extended to Little Mount. “I catch a bus from Besant Nagar to Little Mount and take the metro to my office in Thirumangalam.” Before the launch of the metro in Little Mount, she had to take two buses to reach Thirumangalam. 
 
 Deepika P, an IT professional, takes the metro from Anna Nagar Tower to reach her office in Guindy. “When we take the bus, it’s really crowded and our laptops may get damaged in the crowd. The metro is a safer and faster mode of transport,” she said. 
 
 Although people find the metro costly, regular commuters feel the rates are reasonable as it saves them time and worry. Bhuvaneshwari V takes an auto from Mogappair to reach the Koyambedu metro station and travels till St. Thomas Mount, from where she takes another auto to reach Velachery. “The price can be reduced by Rs 10 or Rs 20, but it’s still cheaper than taking a cab or an auto,” she says.
