MUMBAI: For several decades, the Ambassador was the most sought-after car among chief ministers,  , state guests and distinguished visitors. With the emergence of swanky vehicles, though, they began to refuse to travel by the iconic vehicle. Now, the   government has decided to replace all the 225   in its possession.

 A month ago, the general administration department issued a two-page order to the effect.
 
 For decades,   used Ambassador   for official tours. “These cars were maintained by the protocol branch of the general administration department. In recent past, it was found that most cabinet members, state guests and distinguished visitors either refused to use Ambassador cars or at least expressed their strong displeasure. Under such circumstances, the GAD had no option but to replace all the 225-odd cars,” said a senior bureaucrat and added that a high level review committee first deliberated on the situation, particularly demand for the vehicles.
 
 Chief ministers Vilasrao Deshmukh and Sushilkumar Shinde used to travel by Ambassador. However, after Ashok Chavan took over the reins, it was replaced by SUVs and the trend was continued by his successors, Prithviraj Chavan and now Devendra Fadnavis.
