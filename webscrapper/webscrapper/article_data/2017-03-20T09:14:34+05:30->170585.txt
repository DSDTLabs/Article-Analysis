KOLKATA: A   has covered more than 2,500km on foot along the east coast in less than six months to raise funds for an NGO based in Kolkata. 

 Patrick Baddeley, 63, set out on foot from Kanyakumari in October 2016 and crossed four states and over three dozen towns and cities to reach Kolkata on February 24 at the office of Future Hope, the NGO he set out raising funds for.
 
 Patrick has been to India before and it is the exposure to the weather and food that gave him the courage to undertake the voyage. He has been visiting the country since early 1970s when he was in college. Since then, he had been toying with the idea of embarking on a road trip in memory of her late daughter Katie. Hence, the 'K-Walk'.
 
 "Before I embarked on the mission, I had some idea about the weather, food and people. My knowledge worked to my advantage," said Patrick. He started his journey on foot on October 3 last year and walked through Tamil Nadu,  , Odisha and Bengal along the east coast. He would walk for over six hours a day. "Initially it was very hot, so I would wake up early and start walking. By the time the sun was at its peak, I would be through with my walking," said Patrick.
 
 So did he switch to a particular diet to keep himself nourished and avoid spicy Indian food? "I relied on the local food from roadside eateries and dhabas. Thankfully, everything agreed with my digestive system and it was very tasty," smiled Patrick.
 
 He recalled several anecdotes and interactions throughout his walk. "People were extremely cordial everywhere. Once I was walking down a road in Andhra when a biker happened to pass by. He offered me a lift but I told him I was there to walk and I have promised people I will raise money by doing so. It seems he did not understand Hindi and insisted. I had a trying time explaining him. In Kanyakumari, a samosa seller insisted I take a bagful of the snacks. Several people heard my story and motive and pooled in for the charity," narrated Patrick.
