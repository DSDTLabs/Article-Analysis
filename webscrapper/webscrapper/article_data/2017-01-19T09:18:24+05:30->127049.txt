BATHINDA:   (AAP) convener and Delhi chief minister   on Wednesday released a special manifesto for physically challenged persons of Punjab at Moga and assured a hike in their pension up to Rs 2500 per month.

 Addressing people, including disabled persons at Moga, Kejriwal said, “Pension will be raised up to Rs 2,500 and it will be directly transferred into bank accounts of the physically challenged persons“.
 
 He said if AAP came to power, it would increase the condition of minimum income for pension eligibility from Rs 12,000 per annum to Rs 1 lakh per annum.
 
 He said that for pension purposes, level of disability would be reduced from 50% to 40%, and bedridden patients will be provided a necessary kit, including wheelchair. He added that each physically challenged, bed-ridden person would be provided a `caretaker“ allowance of Rs 5,000 per month.
 
 Backlog of jobs for handicapped persons would be filled within one year and one lakh handicapped would be provided livelihood on priority during the next five-years, he added.
 
 Kejriwal said once AAP forms government in Punjab, land registration fee for handicapped would be reduced, as in case of women and one-time compensation to “khet mazdoor“ and farmers suffering handicap would be enhanced from Rs 30,000 to Rs one lakh.
 
 A specially equipped wing for handicapped would be set up in all hostels for students and professionals in every district, he said.
 
 Kejriwal said a free, 24hour helpline for disabled persons would be set up and a special window for physically challenged created in all suvidha centres, bus stands, and hospitals. The party has already released four separate election documents to woo voters.
