CHENNAI: A project to convert Chennai into a   free city is now stuck in limbo due to lack of interest from the Greater Chennai Corporation.

 The Clean Chennai campaign, launched in November 2014, was impacted by the bureaucratic shutdown following the hospitalisation of former chief minister   in September 2016. The project would have brought together resident welfare associations, individuals and corporate firms on a single platform and integrated different aspects of garbage collection like source segregation, composting and recycling under a single banner.
 
 A website launched as part of the programme --http:www.cleanchennai.com -has been inactive since August 2016. “The potential was there to grow the project into a one-of-a-kind campaign in the country.The political situation in the state has taken a toll on the (campaign's) health,“ said a corporation source. Frequent shuffling of officers connected to the programme, the source said, has been counterproductive. This point was illustrated when   contacted the superintending engineer in-charge of solid waste management, S P Balasubramanian. The official, who has previously held zonallevel postings, told TOI that he had “just taken charge two months ago“ and professed to not knowing about the campaign.
 
 Three 30-second television commercials were produced as part of the campa ign, but the advertisements never made it into the slots provided by local channels due to lack of administrative will, sources said.
 
 While the campaign continues to wither, a helping hand in the form of residents and corporate firms have kept the ethos of the project alive.
 
 “If it were not for the Clean Chennai campaign, it would not have been possible to segregate 60% of the waste generated on  ,“ said a resident, requesting anonymity.
