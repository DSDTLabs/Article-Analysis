 is on cloud nine. Kaushik Ganguly’s  , where she stars along with   and Churni Ganguly, will kick off the 13th edition of Habitat Film Festival in Delhi today. Two of Rituparna’s other films — Dharasnan and   — will also be screened. “It’s a big achievement 
that the festival is opening with Drishtikone. The Habitat Film Festival is a prestigious event and I feel honoured that three of my films will be showcased there. It’s a great feeling when your films do commercially well and also travel to such well-known festivals,” said Rituparna Sengupta. While Drishtikone has been a commercial success, both Dharasnan and Rong Beronger Kori have been critically acclaimed. Speaking on this, Rituparna said, “I oscillate between commercial and art films — I think I gel well with both the genres. I love the craft so much that I don’t want to restrict myself to a certain genre. I want to be known as an actor who can do everything at the same time.” The 13th Habitat Film Festival will be showcasing a host of National Award-winning films along with the best of regional cinema over the next 10 days. The festival also includes films like Atanu Ghosh’s  , Aparna Sen’s Sonata and critically-acclaimed films such as S Durga, Ajji, Idak and Juze.
