PATNA: A day after Uttar Pradesh JD(U) chief   announced his party’s support to SP-Congress alliance in the state assembly elections, the party’s central committee on Monday denied it. “We don’t support any political organization in UP, be it Congress or  . In fact, JD(U) has no working unit in UP. Since all the party units in UP were dissolved at its core committee meeting held in Patna on January 23 this year, Bhaiyya is no longer the party’s UP president, ” JD(U) national secretary general and spokesperson K C Tyagi told TOI over phone from Delhi.

 Bhaiyya on Sunday participated in a joint press conference at the Samajwadi Party’s office in Lucknow and presented himself as the JD(U) chief in UP. He also announced JD(U)’s support to the SP-Congress alliance.
 
 After its crucial core committee meeting on January 23, JD(U) had, on January 25, publicly announced that it would neither contest the UP assembly election nor would support any other political party or alliance in the neighbouring state. But the party had not announced the dissolution of its UP unit. On being asked as to why the JD(U) didn’t announce it on January 25, Tyagi evaded a direct reply. “Please don’t ask this question from me,” he said. 
 
 To a question, Tyagi said, “Bhaiyya is still in the party, but he is not the UP JD(U) president.” 
 
 Tyagi also said Bhaiyya went to the Samajwadi Party’s office to address the press conference on Sunday against the core committee’s decision to stay away from the UP polls.
