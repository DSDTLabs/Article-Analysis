CHANDIGARH: Local MP   has a National Girl Child Day message for all mothers—raise your children in a manner that they become strong and self-independent, be the child a girl or a boy.

 Six single mothers shared their life stories with her during a TOI event on the eve of National Girl Child Day here on Tuesday. Listening to the difficulties they encountered in bringing up their children, Kirron said the best thing mothers could do is prepare their children to face all the challenges without depending on anybody. “Give girls and boys equal education for a better life but also train them to do their own chores.”
 
 To one of the participants,  , whose husband had walked out on her 15 years ago because she had four daughters, Kher advised that she should focus on giving a good lifestyle to her children instead of nursing a grudge against a man who wasn’t worthy of her hatred. The MP was shocked to know that even the 21st-century parents were so son-fixated and cruel to daughters. “The mindset of society must change on this issue,” she said.
 
 Kirron appreciated participant  , a widow who had opened ‘Neki Ki Dukaan’ (Shop of Kindness), an open stall of donated clothes that the needy people could take away for free. The MP found the idea so interesting that she promised to visit the stall with items to donate.
 
 Listening to participant Rubina Joshi’s story of how her estranged in-laws objected to her wearing western clothes and going to parties, the MP said: “Just as you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, don’t judge people by their clothes.” She wondered why the residents of a progressive city should find comfortable western clothes indecent. “Never judge a woman by her clothes,” she said, “and respect her profession.”
