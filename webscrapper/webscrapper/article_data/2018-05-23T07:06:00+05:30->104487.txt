NOIDA: Altogether 148 personnel have been inducted into the   police force and 180 more are set to be recruited over the next few weeks, raising the hopes of officers to be able to curb the menace of wrong-side driving soon.

 In addition to the recent recruitments, the force has been further fortified by the 252 traffic marshals and 26 home guards that were provided by the   to man the roads. Around 50 personnel from the Prantiye Rakshak Dal of the UP government would also join the force in the coming days. The additions to the force followed a request from the traffic department.
 
 The 148 personnel who joined the force by Tuesday were assigned junctions across the city that are seen as problematic areas for traffic movement. Violators were put to task for driving on the wrong side as the policemen lodged FIRs.
 
 SSP Ajay Pal   said the stricter vigil on the road was aimed at creating a regard for the rule of law. “The move is aimed at letting people know that violating the rules can now land them in trouble. We have tried challaning the violators but that has not been so effective. I have said that those driving on the wrong side should be videographed so that their offence is clearly made out. An FIR will be lodged against violators and a chargesheet filed,” he said.
 
 Between May 17 and 21, as many as eight commercial drivers, including seven auto drivers and one taxi driver, have been booked under IPC Section 279 (rash driving) for driving on the wrong side.
 
 The traffic department has also identified 25 major junctions that see congestion almost every day. Sources said quick response teams would be deployed in these areas .
