MUMBAI: To put an end to the constant   disputes between parents and  , state's committee has recommended that a hike cannot be contested if two-third of the parents have agreed to it. The recommendation is part of a draft put up on the state government's website to call for feedback. 

 On May 7, the state education department formed an 11-member committee to suggest amendments to the Fee Regulation Act. The committee which consists of department officials, parents and representatives of school managements have made over 50 recommendations. "These recommendations will be open for feedback up to June 3. After this, the committee will meet once again and give a final report to the government," said Nandkumar, secretary of the school education department. 
 
 Some of the suggestions by the committee include giving power to the divisional fee regulation committee to stay a hike until a dispute is resolved, more parents representations in the Parent Teacher Association's executive panel and presence of an education official at the meeting where is fee hike resolution is to be passed. 
 
 "Once a fee hike is proposed, parents will have 60 days to pay the fees. If at the end of 60 days, more than 2/3 of the parents have paid the fees, it would be assumed that the fee hike is acceptable and the rest of the parents would have to pay the fees in the next 30 days," he said.
 
 However, if two-third of the parents don't pay, the hike would be cancelled and school will not be able to propose a hike once more in the same academic year. "With such a rule in place, the fees will be under a check and there will be no need for a regulatory body. If there still is a dispute, both parties can approach the education inspector and appeal to the deputy director of education," said Nandkumar.
