Mumbai: Dragged by oil stocks, the market fell sharply on Wednesday with the   losing 306 points at 34,345 — a month-low level — as crude continued to hover above the $80-per-barrel mark. Traders and investors on   fear that with public criticism rising against the runaway petrol and diesel prices, the government may be forced to ask   companies to go slow in passing on higher fuel costs to consumers and absorb part of the burden. This, in turn, could affect their profits till   prices stabilise. It’s this fear that led to the sell-off in oil and energy stocks, dealers said.

 Of the large oil marketing companies, HPCL lost over 8%, while BPCL lost 6% and Indian Oil was down 4.9%. In the private sector, energy-to-explorations major RIL closed 1.6% lower. The oil & gas index closed 3.5% lower, while the energy index closed with a 2.5% loss.
 
 The day’s session also left investors poorer by about Rs 1.2 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at just over Rs 145 lakh crore. Wednesday’s trading also saw domestic funds turn net buyers at nearly Rs 800 crore, while foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 311 crore.
 
 Outside of the sensex, metals major Vedanta slid 6.2% after several people were killed during a protest march at its   plant on Tuesday and, subsequently, Madras high court ordered the company to put on hold its expansion plans at the same production facility. 
 
 The day’s slide in the market was also because of the weakness of the rupee, which fell 39 paise to an 18-month low of 68.43 to a dollar, along with rising bond yields and negative global cues. According to Jayant Manglik, president at Religare Broking, the market’s weakness could continue in the near term for a few more sessions, led by uncertain global cues, rising crude oil prices, rupee-dollar movement and muted domestic sentiment.
