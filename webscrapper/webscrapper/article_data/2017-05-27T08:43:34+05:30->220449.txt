KOCHI: Authorities of  ,  , on Friday said that they would protest against the Ernakulam   committee's (CWC) decision to send back children from other states to their native places within 15 days. The CWC had issued the order citing that it is important for a child to grow up in their own culture and society. According to CWC, the `principle of best interest' is violated by Sisubhavan, especially while dealing with children from other states.

 The CWC had also directed the   (DCPU) and the district social justice department to take steps to get school admission for children transferred from Sisubhavan into schools of their respective native places. “We don't want our chil dren to go back to our native states. If they are sent back, they will end up in streets,“ said one of the parents of five children at a press conference here.
 
 Sisubhavan chairman Jose Maveli alleged that CWC is deliberately taking revenge against his institution. “We are protecting children from other states whose parents are working and residing in and around Kerala and those who don't have shelter and land in their state,“ said Maveli.
