MUMBAI: Residents of   adjoining South Mumbai's   have complained to the   about the   of the club which they allege has been emanating a foul smell.

 The residents, in a letter to BMC's 'D' ward have alleged flies, mosquitoes and other insects have infested their homes due to the noxious odour. They fear this could even lead to a disease outbreak.
 
 Last year, the BMC set a deadline of October 2 to stop collecting garbage from housing societies and clubs. This had led the club to install a bio- composting unit.
 
 On Monday, when TOI visited the chawl, the waste unit was found operating in a space right between the club and the chawl. 
 
 Nobert Gomes, one of the residents, alleged foul play. "While we understand the club has permissions in place to operate the unit, it does not mean they should harass us. This appears a ploy to get us to move out of our chawl," he said.
 
 When TOI contacted club secretary Nitin Shah, he put us on to Payal Kanojia from the club management who said, "Bio composting is being done in a secluded area after it is well segregated. The chawl has been having problems with the club and is using the composting unit as an alibi. We have our own staff living in the chawl property and if there was a problem they would have brought the same to our notice."
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner of 'D' ward Vishwas Mote said he would respond to our calls, but failed to do so.
