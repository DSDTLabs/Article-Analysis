PUNE: Doctors treating developer D S   at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH) on Monday termed his   as ‘stable’.

 Kulkarni, who is still in the  , became unconscious after he fell down in the Faraskhana police lockup early on Sunday. He was rushed to the Sassoon hospital and was later shifted to DMH on Sunday night. Kulkarni (68) has other underlying medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension.
 
 “Kulkarni has mild breathlessness and drowsiness. He also complained of shoulder pain for which we consulted an orthopaedic surgeon. His vital parameters are within normal range and his condition is being consistently monitored,” a doctor said.
 
 Kulkarni underwent a battery of tests, including magnetic resonance imaging, 2D echo, abdominal sonography and other pathology tests. “He is being given supportive treatment for his complaints. The medical investigation reports are awaited and the final diagnosis will be clear by Tuesday,” the doctor said.
 
 Doctors who treated him initially at the Sassoon hospital had suspected that he was suffering from Vertebrobasilar insufficiency and metabolic encephalopathy.
 
 Vertebrobasilar insufficiency is a neurological condition characterised by poor blood supply to posterior part of the brain. It is also known as beauty parlour syndrome.
