NEW DELHI:Delhi may get vapour recovery systems at all its petrol pumps by September 30, 2017. Delhi environment minister   on Saturday reviewed the progress on their installation by oil companies. The review meeting was attended by senior officials of the environment department,   and oil companies.

 During the meeting, officials of   said that they have installed vapour recovery systems at 95 of their petrol pumps out of 97. Bharat Petroleum has completed installation at 31 petrol pumps out of 42 and   has installed the system at 60 out of their 190 stations.
 
 Vapour recovery systems prevent evaporation of petrol and diesel while tankers are filled at fuel stations. Petrol contains volatile organic compounds including Benzene that evaporate inside the fuel tank of a vehicle and fill the space above the liquid fuel. When a vehicle is refuelled, these vapours are forced out from the fuel tank by incoming fuel and unless controlled, these vapour escape into the atmosphere. 
 
 “Vapour recovery systems not only help to curb the release of toxic volatile organic compounds but also reduce evaporative losses of valuable fuel,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director at CSE.
