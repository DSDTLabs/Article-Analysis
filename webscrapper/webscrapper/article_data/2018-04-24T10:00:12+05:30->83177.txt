NEW DELHI: Karnataka is headed for a cliffhanger in the assembly elections with a clear majority elusive for both   and  , according to a Times Now and VMR opinion poll. Deve Gowda’s JD(S) is likely to emerge as the kingmaker.

  
  
 In the 224-member assembly, Congress is projected to get 91 seats with BJP finishing close with 89 — both parties well short of 113 seats required to form government. JD(S) keeps 40 seats. The survey predicts a loss of 31 seats for Congress while a gain of 49 seats for BJP.
 
  
  
 
 Congress’s vote share is projected to increase to 38.6% from 36.6%, BJP’s projected to improve to 20% from its current 15% — merger of Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) and B Sreeramulu’s BSR Congress with BJP seems to be a factor. While ‘others’ — mainly the two splinter groups — recorded 25% vote share in 2013, this year the share in this category is projected to come down to 9.5%.
