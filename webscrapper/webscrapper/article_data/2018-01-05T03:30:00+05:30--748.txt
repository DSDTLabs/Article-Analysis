Visakhapatnam: When it comes to fitness and wellness, age is just a number, said Usha Soman (79), Milind Soman’s mother, at a BPO in the city on Thursday. She also showed the audience her ability to do planks, push-ups and even run a distance. The port city will host the   run on January 7 at 6pm.

 “Running is like dance which comes naturally along with an opportunity to explore. Running for health has gained popularity from the past few years and now every city boasts of a running event,” Milind Soman, model-turned-founder of Pinkathon, said.
 
 He was in the city on Thursday to promote running as a community activity for a healthy living. ”Women are the ones who influence the family to make right choices and to prioritise health,” Milind said.
