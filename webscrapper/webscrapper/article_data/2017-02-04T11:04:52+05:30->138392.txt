BHATINDA: The family of a man suspected to be involved in the January 31 twin blasts in Maur town of Bathinda alleged on Friday that the police had picked up his cousin and kept him in “illegal detention”.

 Police suspected  , a baptised Sikh from the town, to be behind the blast. His wife,  , alleged at a press conference here that police raided their house on the night of December 31. “When they did not find him, they took away Gursharan,” she said. 
 
 After the press conference, police let Gursharan off the hook. When contacted, Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP)   refuted the allegations. He said though police had raided Kulbir’s residence, they had not found him there and had merely called his cousin for questioning. “He has since been let off,” he said. 
 
 Kulbir was booked in three police cases under Unlawful Activities Act and Arms Act in 2009, following clashes between Sikhs and Dera Sacha Sauda followers. He was acquitted later. “We had sent a complaint to the   and have demanded action against the police,” Satnam added.
