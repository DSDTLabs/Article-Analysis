HYDERABAD: A choreographer was arrested by   on Saturday for allegedly raping a 19-year-old B Com student from Kolkata. She said the assault took place when she visited the city in February. 

 Police said  , a choreographer-cum-event manager, was arrested while his accomplices Sultan, Pinky Roy and two others were absconding. 
 
 According to the victim’s complaint, which was sent on email, she took a flight from Kolkata to Hyderabad on February 14. She shared a cab with a female co-passenger Pinky Roy to reach Hotel Park. During the ride, the victim told Pinky how she was planning to go around the city. Pinky convinced her to visit tourist hotspots with her and a friend, who has a car. 
 
 On February 15, Pinky called up Preeth, a resident of Marredpally, saying she was at Hotel Sitara Paradise, Ameerpet, along with the student. Preeth arrived in a   car and picked up the duo. After travelling for some distance, Preeth made a gesture and Pinky disembarked claiming she needed to attend to an emergency. Preeth told Pinky that he needs to rush home, Misha Mansion, and they could visit places later. 
 
 “As per the victim’s claims, after reaching Misha Mansion, Preeth offered coffee to the victim. Within a few minutes, she started feeling drowsy. He pulled her hand, pushed her, slapped her and said “you will be let off if you sleep with me”. He then raped her. He confined her to the room by locking it and snatched away her wallet, which had Rs 7,000 cash and two gold rings. The next day, Preeth’s driver Sultan raped the victim,” deputy commissioner of police ( ) B Sumathi said in an official release.
