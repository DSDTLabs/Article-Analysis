INDORE: Women of   community on Tuesday staged a   at Indore district and session court against the arrest of six youths of their community who were accused of possessing arms and planning a dacoity.   police had arrested six people from the area on May 19.

 
 Around 50 women claimed that six youths were first picked up by police from their village Dhani Ghati in Dewas. From there, they were brought to Indore and their arrest was shown in Tejaji Nagar area.
 
 “Out of the six, four were produced before the court of judicial magistrate first class Sakshi Kapoor, who sent them to jail till June 5. The women alleged that police had framed false charges against them,” advocate Rajendra Yadav said. 
 
 Women also claimed that youths arrested by police were students at different schools and colleges in Indore and two of them had also been felicitated by chief minister   for scoring over 75 percentage in Class XII exams. They said that youths had come to their village for summer vacations and had no relation to any crime. 
 
 Some members of their community also went to Bhopal raising the same issue and gave evidence of their good performance in the exams. They blamed chief minister of deliberately maligning the image of their community by the arrests, when the boys were focusing on their studies.
