CHANDIGARH: A   man and his mother were held guilty of driving his wife to suicide here on Tuesday. The court of additional district and sessions judge   will pronounce the quantum of sentence for Praveen Kumar and his mother, Leela Devi, on Friday. She, however, acquitted Praveen's brother, Parvinder. 

 Praveen and his family live in Pinjore. His wife, Inderjit Kaur, was a resident of Sector 51. In his complaint to the police, her father, Prem Singh, had alleged that Inderjit committed suicide at his home by hanging herself from a cloth tied to a ceiling fan on February 16, 2017. 
 
 He had said that Inderjit married Parveen in 2007. However, she had been living in Chandigarh since 2013 because of a matrimonial dispute arising out of harassment meted out by her in-laws and husband, he said. He claimed that Inderjit had gotten depressed because of her strained marriage and committed suicide. 
 
 Inderjit left behind a suicide note in which she had blamed her in-laws and husband for her taking the extreme step. It proved to be a vital evidence for the conviction of the mother-son duo. The accused had been booked at Sector 49 police station, under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 The defence counsel had, however, argued that the accused had been falsely implicated in the case.
