Coimbatore: While vegetable and fish prices are climbing in local markets, what if you could catch fish for dinner and collect the veggies right from your terrace garden? A new style of gardening called aquaponics offers just that. To educate the public about aquaponics, a city-based entrepreneur has launched an exhibition at Tadabad here. The exhibition called Glow Steam Lab will remain open round-the-year, said AK Saravanan, founder of the lab, who has been cultivating vegetables using the technique for more than a year. In the integrated system, a high density of fish and vegetables could be grown in a unit, with just one-tenth of water that would be required for conventional farming, Saravanan told TOI. “Water used in the aquaculture bed could be fed into the crops’ bed as soon as it is filled with ammonia from fish excreta. Ammonia is converted into nitride and later into nitrate, a much-need nutrient for plants, through engineering process,” he said. As soil absorbs most of the water content than the plants, different mediums including gravel, charcoal and pebbles are used to grow the plants, he said. “Initially, it would take upto 45 days for the water recycle, post which water would be recycled round-the-clock. The produce of this process are completely organic as usage of inorganic products including pesticide or manure could bring health complications to the fish. With lesser water, manpower and space, high yield could be produced with this technique,” he explained. The initial investment is high as the technique requires 24-hour power supply. To grow about 40 to 50 crops, the initial cost would be around a lakh of rupee. “The acidic level of the water should be monitored regularly to ensure good health of the fish,” Saravanan said.   “It’s been only a few months since I started to spread the word, but have received numerous requests from people, especially from software engineers, across the country,” he added.
