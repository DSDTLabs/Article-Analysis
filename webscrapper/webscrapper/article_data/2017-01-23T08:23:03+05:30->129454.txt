LUCKNOW: He figured prominently on the cover of party manifesto, but Samajwadi patriarch   chose to skip the event when his son  , in his first public appearance after 
  , released the manifesto on Sunday. 

 Uncle Shivpal, who stood by Mulayam in the family feud, was also absent. An empty chair next to Akhilesh added to speculation that Mulayam may join the event later.
 
 As time passed by, it was clear that Mulayam, who was present at his Vikramaditya Marg residence, was giving the event a miss.
 
 What left the audience and the media guessing about Mulayam’s presence at the event was a phone call that Akhikesh received minutes after he came on the dais flanked by senior ministers Azam Khan, Ahmed Hasan, Balwant Singh Ramoowalia and others. 
 
 There was speculation that senior minister Azam Khan, who left for Mulayam’s residence apparently to convince SP patriarch to attend the function, would return with him. In the meantime, SP officials kept the audience engaged with their speeches. Once it was clear that Mulayam would not come, Akhilesh began his speech. 
 
 He mentioned Mulayam when he spoke about his government’s laptops scheme. “The highlight of the laptops is that when it is switched on, a photograph of Netaji (Mulayam) and myself comes on the screen... something which no one can erase,” he said. 
 
 Barely half-an-hour after the event concluded and Akhilesh left, Mulayam’s motorcade entered the SP HQ through the second gate with Azam Khan in tow.
