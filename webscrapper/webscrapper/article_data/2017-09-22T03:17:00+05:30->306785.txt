Panaji: Officials of the Special Investigating Team (SIT) inquiring into illegal mining cases, searched the office of businessman Imran Khan at Fatorda in connection with the illegal extraction of iron ore at Curpem in Sanguem taluka.

 SP Karthik Kashyap told TOI that incriminating documents were found in Khanâ€™s office. Documents seized suggest that Khan was associated in ore mining in the mine belonging to lease holder late Amalia Figuereido. 
 
 The team led by PI Dattaguru Sawant found documents including copies of a power of attorney relating to the mining lease. Officials suspect that the mine was in operation between 2007-2012 and that the accused, in connivance with some politicians, was involved in reviving mines whose ECs had lapsed.
 
 Khan had told the police during the interrogation last week that he had not conducted any mining operation but had been a trader. He said he had only sold iron ore. Khan was arrested and released last week.
