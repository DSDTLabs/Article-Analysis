Zirakpur: The municipal council’s dithering to rid Dhakoli of   has added to the problems in eight housing societies. The affected residents are tired raising this issue with the deputy commissioner and the executive officer (EO) concerned.

 Even though the officials claim to have told the MC to remove all encroachment with the assistance of the local police, the date for this action is not fixed yet. Pankaj Rana of Gulmohar Trends housing society said the slum around these residential apartments had expanded to an extent where his guests had started teasing him for buying a house in “a village”. They pity him for choosing to live where there is no garbage collection system or safety.
 
 Harish Sharma of Dhakoli was away last week when his house got burgled. “The CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras caught intruders who looked like from the slums. Four years ago, a house on the same floor was broken into in a similar way. “Police should do something fast to control the crime,” he said.
 
 Unified president welfare association K R Sharma said that number of meetings with the authorities concerned on this issue had failed. “Even orders were out to remove the encroachment but no one implemented those,” he said. “The land around Dhakoli’s Solitary Divine Society is under massive encroachment, even though it was in November last year that the residents had asked the MC to remove the squatters. The slum dwellers have illegal connections of electricity and water supply.”
 
 In the dock
 
 Now that I have been appointed as duty magistrate, I will sit with the area station house officer to fix the date for the removal of these 150-odd shanties. After March 31, I will hold another meeting with police about evicting the illegal slum-dwellers. Rules require us to give the slum-dwellers an eviction notice before any action.
