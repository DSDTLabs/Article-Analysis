They also touched upon Bachchan’s entry into Bollywood and the director’s first memory of the actor, their struggles and anecdotes from the sets of filmmakers like Manmohan Desai, Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Yash Chopra. The conversation also veered towards social media trolls and nepotism.

As a filmmaker and film patron attracted to movies primarily because of watching him on screen starting from  , my interview will be markedly different. I tried to delve into the emotional aspects of his memories and influences. I kept the ambience conversational.” The video can be streamed from today on Eros Now. 
 
 '  3', presented by Eros International and produced by Alumbra Entertainment, Wave Cinemas and AB Corp, releases May 12.
