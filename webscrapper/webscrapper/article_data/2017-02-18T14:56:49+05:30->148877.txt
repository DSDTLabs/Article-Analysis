NEW DELHI: Three years ago on February 18, 2014   etched his name in New Zealand cricket history with a magnificent knock that made him the first ever from his country to score a triple century in Test cricket. 

 During the second Test of India's tour of New Zealand in 2014, the hosts were staring down the barrel and looked on their way to squandering their 1-0 lead. Trailing by 246 runs and already 94/5 in the second innings, India were closing in on victory. However, McCullum produced an innings that changed the landscape of New Zealand cricket. 
 
 He shared a 346-run stand with   for the sixth wicket and a 179-run stand with debutant   who scored a century. Along the way, McCullum battled injuries to his knee, shoulder and back and demonstrated admirable ability in his concentration. Every run was getting cheered and every record was cheered. 
 
 In the 200th over of the innings, McCullum steered a ball from Zaheer and created history to become New Zealand's first triple centurion. His 302 included 32 fours and four sixes as New Zealand drew the match to notch up their first series win against India in 12 years. 
 
 The closest a New Zealander came to a triple-ton before McCullum was in 1991 when the late   agonizingly fell short of the landmark by just one run against Sri Lanka in Wellington in second innings. Batting on 299, Crowe ended up being out caught behind with three more deliveries left in the match.
