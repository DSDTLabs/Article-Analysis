CHENNAI: Deputy chief minister   on Monday attributed the rise in debt-GSDP ratio in the last two years to the substantial increase in salaries and pension components of the government employees. There is no corresponding growth in state’s own tax revenue to meet these additional requirements, he said. 

 He was reacting to DMK MLA B Ranganathan, who raised concerns over mounting debt. “The debt-GSDP ratio increase is owing to drop in state’s own tax revenue growth rate, especially in the receipts from commercial taxes and excise duty through Tasmac sale,” the deputy chief minister said. The improvements to economy and the resultant growth in revenue receipts will help decrease the debt burden. Panneerselvam said the net outstanding debt will be Rs 3.56 lakh crore at the end of March next year.
