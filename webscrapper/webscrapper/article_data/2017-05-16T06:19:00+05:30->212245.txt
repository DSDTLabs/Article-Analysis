Ghaziabad: Hours after a massive fire reduced the Wilkinson chemical warehouse to ashes in Bulandshahr Industrial Area on Sunday night, a minor fire broke out in another factory in Kavi Nagar Industrial Area on Monday afternoon, just 3km away from the warehouse. Short circuit sparked the blaze in both the incidents.

 While no loss of human life was reported in the two fire incidents, three of six cows tethered to a pole in Wilkinson warehouse compound were charred to death.
 
 The blaze broke out in Wilkinson warehouse at around 10pm on Sunday night. 
 
 Nearly 1,000 drums of 2,000 litre capacity, filled with chemicals were kept in the warehouse premises, which exploded one after the other, as the fire spread.
 
 “This was among the biggest fire incidents that I have seen in my life. We couldn’t go near the inner factory premises till 12.30am,” said Sanjiv Yadav, fire station officer, Kotwali Police Station. 
 
 It took more than six hours and 27 fire tenders to control the blaze. A tractor and two tempos parked in the driveway were also charred in the fire. The NDRF team was also deployed at the location for relief and rescue measures.
 
 In the second incident, about 14 employees were inside the factory of Belkin Paint Private Ltd when fire erupted in the first floor following a short circuit at around 3pm, said fire officials. The staff members called up the fire department upon noticing that smoke was emanating from the roof.
 
 “We were called by 3.20pm and we reached the spot within 20 minutes,” said Kumar. “Two fire tenders were rushed to the location and the flames were doused within 10 minutes,” he added. 
 
 No casualties were reported in the incident.
