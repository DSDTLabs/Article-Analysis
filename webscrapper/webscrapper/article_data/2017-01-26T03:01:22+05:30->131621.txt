NAVI MUMBAI: Schools all over the city are ready with their traditional   celebrations, but many students are not even aware of its significance. While schools do stress on its relevance, for many it remains just another holiday.

 Some students know little about what it means and when India became a Republic and apart from a flag hoisting, its literally another holiday. 
 
 “I think Independence Day is understood better and we know more about the freedom struggle. January 26 and its significance is not much talked about,” said  , a student from Vashi. 
 
 Of course, the parade on television remains the biggest attraction and it is thrilling for students to watch the nation's finest on display. “The most important part of the day is the parade,” said Sanpada resident Manmeet Singh.
 
 Schools do discuss the relevance of January 26, but Independence Day is something they can relate to better. “It’s a holiday for us after a short programme in school, but a holiday nevertheless. We are taught about it, but somehow it doesn’t seem very relevant,” said   from Vashi. 
 
 Although she admits that awareness of the significance of January 26 is necessary.
