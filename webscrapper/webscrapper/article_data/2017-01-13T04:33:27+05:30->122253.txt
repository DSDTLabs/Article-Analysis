CHENNAI: A vice-chancellor for University of Madras could be appointed soon, higher education secretary A Karthik indicated on Thursday. The indication came at a meeting of the syndicate where 12 members, all senior professors, gave a representation seeking the re-constitution of the three-member   convener committee. 

 Karthik, who is chairman of the convener committee, told the syndicate members to 'wait' and that "the convener committee would be a short-term affair because of which it wouldn't need to be re-constituted." He didn't respond to calls or messages from TOI. 
 
 The university has been without a vice-chancellor since January 2016, when R Thandavan's term ended. Regular and special academic decisions and functions like the convocation have been stuck as a result. A three-member search panel was appointed, but it has not yet recommended any names.
 
 Thursday's meeting also resolved that the term of the controller of examinations S Thirumagan would end without an extension. 
 
 Criminology department head, professor  , will be in-charge controller of examinations, and M R  , head of statistics department, will be college development council dean.
 
 A circular issued by registrar P   mandating that prior permission had to be taken for academic programmes, drawing protests from professors, was withdrawn. Some members said Karthik questioned Jawahar on his locus standi to issue academic circulars as he was only the administrative head. 
 
 He also Karthik also asked Jawahar why action taken reports on previous syndicate resolutions had not been presented. Jawahar told TOI the circulars would be reworded and not withdrawn. 
 
 As demanded at the previous syndicate meeting, Jawahar also presented a white paper on the university's finances till September 30, 2016. "Financial reform and prudency is needed. It will be analysed by syndicate members," he told TOI.
