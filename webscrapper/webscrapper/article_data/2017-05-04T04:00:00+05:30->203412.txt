Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Wednesday razed the workshop erected by the city bus service operator in Sayajigunj opposite the M S University campus. 

 The VMC had instructed the city bus operator Vinayak Logistics to vacate its workshop space recently. The operator has been given alternative space to set up its workshop behind the new state transport (ST) bus depot in Pratapgunj.
 
 VMC officials said that the razing drive on Wednesday was conducted to remove the construction and shades remaining at the site after the workshop was shifted. The civic body plans to develop green space in the area. In the long run, the city bus stand near the workshop from where the operator operates will also be removed.
 
 The traffic department of the city police also vacated the space adjoining the university campus that it used to keep impounded vehicles. The department has been given alternative space under the Jetalpur railway under-bridge to keep these vehicles. Fencing and other facilities are being developed under the bridge for keeping the vehicles.
 
 Sources said that the VMC had zeroed down upon space near the Narhari Hospital in Fatehgunj for the traffic department’s office. The office is currently located in the historical Sayajigunj clock tower building. “There is hardly any scope for expansions in the existing building and even he Sayajigunj police station had moved out of it after a new building was constructed. At the new site in Fatehgunj, the department can have better facilities and will be more organised,” said a VMC official.
