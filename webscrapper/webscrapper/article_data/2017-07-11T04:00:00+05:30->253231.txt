Vadodara: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a historic visit to Israel, a group of Indians will take a step further to establish close ties with the Israelis. 

 A grand cultural and musical festival is being planned by a Gujarati who has been rooting for better Indo-Israel ties since decades. Nikitin Contractor, convener of Friends of Israel, Vadodara, is in talks with the city authorities of Israel to organize the Festival of India there. 
 
 “The festival will be organized in either September end or the first week of October this year. The idea behind organizing this festival is to have a people-to-people contact between Indians and Israelis. We want to share our culture with the Israelis who admire Indians a lot,” Nikitin told TOI. He was invited to Israel by the Indian embassy during Modi’s recent visit.
 
 “We will be organizing drama, musical events,   and Indian food festival wherein several cuisines of different states will be served. Two Marathi plays ‘Mumbai Aamchi’ and ‘Khidki’ will be staged there along with folk dances of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat. We will also show some Indian films,” he added. The first leg of the festival will be held in Ashkelon city with whom Vadodara has signed a twin city agreement. 
 
 “Very few know that of 1.40 lakh population of Ashkelon, about 5,000 Jews had originally stayed in Mumbai and Pune. They moved back to Israel decades ago. Apart from Ashkelon, we will also organize the festival in Tel Aviv and Eilat,” Nikitin added. Ashkelon council has also agreed to start programs in agriculture and medical internship for students from Vadodara. Nikitin has also initiated process to urge Israeli government to start an Indo-Israeli cultural centre in the city.
