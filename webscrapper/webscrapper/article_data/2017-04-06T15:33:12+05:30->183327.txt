 It however increased the   at which it pays to lenders by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent, narrowing the policy rate corridor.
 
 Given the upside risks to inflation and excess liquidity in the system, the   has been retained at 6.25 per cent but the reverse repo has been revised upwards. The Marginal Standing Facility has been revised downwards (rpt) downwards by 0.25 per cent to 6.5 per cent, the central bank said in the first bi-monthly monetary policy review of 2017-18.

The second worry arises from the GST implementation and the third upside risks to inflation comes from the seventh pay commission award, according to the Monetary Policy Committee.
 
 "For 2017-18, inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half and 5 per cent in the second half," the RBI said.
 
 "The main one stems from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the south west monsoon in view of the rising probability of an El Ni√±o event around July-August, and its implications for food inflation," it said. 
 
 RBI Governor Urjit Patel said the bank had to absorb a surge in liquidity in the system after demonetisation, and the focused is on removing the liquidity overhang.
