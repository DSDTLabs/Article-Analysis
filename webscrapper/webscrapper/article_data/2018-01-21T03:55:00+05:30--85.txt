Margao: Curtorim MLA Alexio Reginaldo Lourenco on Saturday demanded a white paper on number of Goans employed in casinos. He said that he will ‘salute’ Parrikar in the assembly if the casino workforce constitutes over 60 per cent Goans.

 Lourenco told reporters that he sought to know why no action was taken against casino owners who defaulted on salary payment to Goan staff.
 
 “Instead of taking punitive action against them, Parrikar bestowed upon the defaulters more licences to operate casinos,’’ he alleged. 
 
 The MLA also came down heavily on the labour department for being mute spectator to the woes of Goans employed in casinos.
