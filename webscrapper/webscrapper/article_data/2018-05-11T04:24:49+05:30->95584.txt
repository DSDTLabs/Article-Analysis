MUMBAI: Residents of the island city and western suburbs suffering due to loud noise from excavation work for the underground   3 corridor will have to continue to bear it till December. That’s because the excavation work will have reached very deep by then. 

 “High noise generating piling activity is temporary and will be completed by December 2018 by when excavation activities would also reach to 10 to 12 metres deep, thereby significantly reducing noise levels,”   managing director Ashwini Bhide said on Thursday during a meeting with principal secretary (Transport & Port) Manoj Saunik and   founder   on noise mitigation measures implemented by MMRC. 
 
 The MMRC said that it is ready to implement feasible noise mitigation measures. Bhide said, “We have installed noise barriers at Cuffe Parade and   stations. The techniques of removing muck with mechanical device is specially designed to eliminate impulsive noise created by piling activity.” 
 
 Bhide also pointed out that the baseline noise levels measured in 2016-17 are already above the permissible limits. Abdulali said, “I have been invited by MMRC to visit the sites and observe the noise reduction measures they have taken and also those proposed. These measures include erection of noise barriers, other appropriate technological solutions, citizens' grievance
 committees and training of construction managers and staff.” 
 
 Abudlali, who measured the noise levels at some construction sites, said, “Readings were undertaken as compliance to a high court order. While heavy machinery operated within very close distances (residents claimed they were ‘able to touch’ the machines from their windows) of homes, no noise barriers, mufflers or any other mitigation measures were visible at locations visited.”
