BENGALURU: In a move that could decongest Majestic intermodal transport hub,   on Tuesday opened two subways and a walkway.

 The walkway connects western entrance of the Kempegowda   interchange station to the existing subway from the BMTC terminus and the railway station, and ensures safe movement for pedestrians using bus services (both BMTC and KSRTC stations), Metro interchange (both north-south and east-west corridors) and trains (City railway station). The 175-metre-long walkway was constructed at a cost of Rs 1 crore.
 
 The 200-metre subway from   interchange station to Chikka Lalbagh area along the Tunk Bund Road cost BMRCL Rs 8 crore. Another subway has been built from   station to   along Minerva Mills Road.
 
 More than five lakh people frequent the Majestic area.
