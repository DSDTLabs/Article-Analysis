Mangaluru: Congress MLAs K   and B A Mohiuddin Bawa briefly locked horns in the presence of minister for planning, statistics, science and technology M R Seetharam on Thursday. The incident took place when the trio were awaiting the arrival of district minister B Ramanath Rai to inaugurate the Swami Vivekananda Planetarium - India’s first opto mechanical digital 3D 8K planetarium at Dr Shivarama Karantha Pilikula Nisargadhama here.

 Sources privy to the incident said Bava introduced mayor   to Seetharam stating that she was at the fag end of her one-year tenure. Seetharam, in turn, advised Bava to give Kavitha the opportunity to progress in her political career to which Mangaluru City North MLA instinctively said she was an aspirant for Mulki-Moodbidri assembly constituency in the coming polls. Jain is the sitting MLA from this constituency and this did not go down well with him.
 
 Jain, who is less inclined to seek re-election from the constituency if the party considers to field his protégé Mithun Rai instead, reacted angrily at this innocuous suggestion. Understanding he had touched a raw nerve with Jain, Bava, hastily changed the topic and tried to make amends. The duo were seen walking separately once Rai made an appearance at the venue and Jain’s stony face did not leave much to interpretation that Bava had rooted for the wrong aspirant.
 
 Interestingly, Jain also had a similar run in with party MLC Ivan D’Souza on October 22 when the duo landed up at Mangaluru International Airport to receive CM Siddaramaiah who was en route to Bantwal to dedicate and lay the foundation stone for various development works there. Ivan, too, is an aspirant for Jain’s constituency and has started political groundwork there. Ivan and Jain exchanged words on that occasion and footage of the incident had gone viral.
