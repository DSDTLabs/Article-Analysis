MADURAI: A 50-year-old man has filed a plea before the   bench of the Madras high court seeking Rs 30 lakh compensation for his seven-year-old, who was killed when an electric pole fell on her. To this, court on Wednesday ordered notice to the state’s electricity department secretary, its chairman and Madurai collector. 

 One A Pugalenthi, a washerman from East Santhaipettai in Madurai has filed the plea. When it came up for hearing before justice M S  , the petitioner’s counsel said that on April 24 last year the petitioner’s daughter Pandeeswari was playing near her house. Suddenly, an electric pole fell on her. She sustained grievous injuries and subsequently died. The Theppakulam police registered the case under 304 (A) of IPC (Causing death by negligence) on the basis of the petitioner’s complaint. 
 
 On July 17, the petitioner received a communication from the collector that the government sanctioned Rs 1 lakh compensation to the family under the chief minister relief fund. Though no money was given so far, the petitioner was unhappy with the amount announced. 
 
 Due to poor maintenance by the electricity department, the electric pole fell down. Thus, the government should give Rs 30 lakh compensation to the petitioner’s family. Regarding that, the petitioner sent representation to officials concerned on March 6. But, there was no action on it, his petition said. 
 
 Hence, it was necessary to issue a direction to the officials to pay Rs 30 lakh compensation, the counsel said. Following it, the court ordered notice and adjourned the case to June 2nd week.
