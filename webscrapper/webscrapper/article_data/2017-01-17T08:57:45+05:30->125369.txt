CHARMINAR:   is reeling under  , dug-up   strewn on the streets despite promises made by the   (GHMC) to take care of the problem. Residents and traders are peeved at the slow progress and are planning to send a petition to top officials.

 “There is no respite from overflowing sewage and   for the last 20 days. The problem has become a serious threat to everyone in the locality . However, the work started by GHMC to restore it is so slow that it has become a pain for residents and traders alike. The entire lane stinks of garbage, and attending to customers has become a headache as many of them complain of the foul stench,'' Moosa Bhai, a shopkeeper at Dattatreya colony said.
 
 Locals of the colony also said that the GHMC has failed to stop existing overflowing sewage while other manholes were left opened thus making it difficult for residents to commute in the area. “Open manholes and garbage on the road compel children and elders to stay indoors. We are not allowing our children to venture out to play .School going children, motorists and others face difficulties to pass through the lane. We want the authorities to speed up the work and cover the dug-up manholes immediately,'' U Sreenu, another resident said.
 
 A vegetable vendor, Laxmana says that the entire lane was dug up and manholes were left open by the GHMC workers. “Earlier, overflowing sewage water was a big problem but now the dug up stretch has hit my business hard. The customers even can't stand for a minute because of foul smell,'' he added.
