AGARTALA:Tripura chief minister   on Wednesday stood by his statement about the existence of internet and satellite communication in the age of the ‘Mahabharata’, accusing his critics of lacking nationalism. 

 Governor   came to the CM’s defence, saying that prototypes must have paved the way for present-day technologies. “A small section of people in our country is desperate to undermine India’s status and highlight that of others because of their lack of nationalism. I believe only narrowminded people can do such things and trigger a controversy without trying to understand the depth of the statement. But I stand by my belief,” Deb said. 
 
 Addressing a workshop on the commercialisation of public distribution system (PDS) on Tuesday, Deb had said, “Internet and satellite communication had existed in the days of ‘Mahabharata’. 
 
 How else could Sanjaya (the charioteer of King Dhritarashtra in the epic) give a detailed account and description to the blind king about the battle of  ? It means internet was there, the satellites and that technology was there in this country at that time.”. “Tripura CM’s observations about the happenings in the puranic period are topical. It is virtually impossible to conceive of devices like ‘Divya Drishti’, ‘Pushpaka Ratha’, etc. without some kind of prototype and study thereon,” governor Roy tweeted in CM’s defence.
