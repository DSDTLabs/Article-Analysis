HYDERABAD: News of an early onset of southwest monsoon comes as a boon for the farming community in   with the   (IMD), Hyderabad, forecasting 97% average rainfall between June and September.

 
 According to the IMD forecast, the southwest monsoon’s arrival in Kerala was delayed between 2013 and 2016. While monsoon arrived on May 30 last year, IMD has predicted that it will enter Kerala on May 29 this year, thereby entering Telangana between June 4 and June 8.
 
  
  
 
 The state recorded a 13% deficit during monsoon in 2017, whereas in 2016 rainfall was 19% in surplus. “The long period average (LPA) of seasonal rainfall in Telangana between June and September is 75.5cm. This year, the seasonal rainfall is likely to be 97% of the LPA with plus or minus four per cent,” said YK Reddy, director, IMD Hyderabad.
 
 Agricultural experts opine that advancement of monsoon will help the farmers in procuring increased and quality yield. “The rainfall was delayed for the last three to four years, resulting in crop failure. Early onset of monsoon will benefit the farmers as they will be able to start sowing by June 15,” said G  , agricultural scientist with Centre for Sustainable Agriculture.
 
 While early onset of monsoon may advance sowing of crops, experts say proper rainfall spread throughout the season can help the yield. “Last year, there were large dry spells which led to 20-40% crop failure. While the state may receive normal rainfall, it will benefit farmers if there are no dry spells,” said Ramanjaneyulu.
 
 He added that early sowing of crops will procure yield by August or September. “If there is delay in sowing of crops, farmers will be able to procure yield by November-December with high risk of crop failure,” Ramanjaneyulu added.
