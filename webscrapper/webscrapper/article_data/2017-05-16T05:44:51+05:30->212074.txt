Panaji: If the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry’s plans to hold a national-level entrance test for engineering seats across India from 2018 materialises, the Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) will not be conducted from next year, director of technical education Vivek Kamat said on Monday. On February 19, 2017, TOI as the first to report that this could be the last year the GCET is held. With the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) being held for admissions to medicine and dentistry seats across the country, and with homeopathy and ayurveda admissions, too, being brought under NEET’s ambit from 2017, GCET is increasingly proving to be redundant.  GCET was held in 2017 for admissions to professional degree seats in Goa in engineering, pharmacy, nursing and allied health programmes. With the HRD ministry announcing plans for a common entrance exam for admissions to engineering seats across the country, it is expected that admissions for pharmacy seats will also be held through this test as there, too, students are tested on the same subjects. This will make it pointless to conduct a state entrance test for admissions to only the nursing and allied health programmes. Even if GCET is held next year for admissions to pharmacy, nursing and the allied health courses, it will barely be able to be termed as a common entrance exam with most of the professional streams in Goa not under its purview any more.
