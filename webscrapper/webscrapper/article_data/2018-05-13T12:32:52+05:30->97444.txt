KOZHIKODE:   state committee member and district secretary P Mohanan on Saturday said his party would vote for the   in constituencies where there is a direct fight between the Congress and the   in the upcoming elections to the Lok Sabha. 

 
 Speaking at a national seminar on "Empowered Nation, Secure Nation,' organized by the Wisdom Islamic Organisation here, he said the party had decided not to contest the seats where it has only negligible number of votes.
 
 "In states like Kerala, where we have enough strength, we will have our candidates. But in other places where we are not that strong, we will ensure the victory of secular forces. We have no problem in casting votes in favour of the hand symbol to keep the BJP away from power," the CPM leader said.
 
 Mohanan said differences of opinion on issues would not come in the way of the decision to defeat the BJP.
 
 "We may have varied views but there can be a platform to discuss the differences. But the issue of paramount importance is to protect the freedom to express one's opinion," he said. The CPM leader said Muslims were subjected to unspeakable horrors during the time of the partition, but there was then no feeling of insecurity among them. "The Muslims at the time felt they were safe in India because the then Prime Minister   had the courage to challenge the Hindutva forces. Now, the minorities are increasingly feeling insecure under the present dispensation," Mohanan said.
 
 Inaugurating the seminar, Riswan Qaiser, director of comparative religions and civilisations at the Jamia Milia Islamiyya, New Delhi, said the basic pillars of the country have been facing constant attack. Quoting the examples of   and Aligarh Muslim University, the said the institutions of repute were being singled out and targeted.
 
 Qaiser said he was for removing the portrait of Muhammadali Jinnah from AMU. "But at the same time, the portrait of Savarkar also should be removed from Parliament," he said.
