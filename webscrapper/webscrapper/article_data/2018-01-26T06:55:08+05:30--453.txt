VARANASI: The district administration has imposed a hefty penalty of Rs 92,120 each on the 15 students accused of damaging 17 vehicles during a violent protest on BHU campus on December 20 after the arrest of a student leader.

 ADM (City)   issued an order in this regard, which stated that in case of a default in paying the penalty, the process of realization of the fine will be started on the line of land revenue dues. Violence had erupted on December 20 immediately after the   police arrested student leader Ashutosh  , accused of disrupting a cultural show at IIT-BHU on November 10. An FIR against 11 persons, including Singh, was lodged in this connection.
 
 
 The court had issued nonbailable warrants against six of the accused, including Singh, following which he was arrested on December 20. This sparked yet another violent protest in the BHU campus, in which, Singh’s supporters torched a school bus and damaged 16 other vehicles. On December 21, another FIR was lodged against Singh and his aides for threatening officials of the CPWD, which is constructing many buildings on the campus. Singh’s bail plea was rejected by special judge (essential commodity act)   on Wednesday.
 
 Following the December 20 violence on the campus, the regional transport department officials were asked to assess the loss caused by the agitators. In the assessment report, the department showed a loss of over Rs 13.81lakhs, said Pandey. The district administration then fined each of the 15 accused a sum of Rs 92,120 to compensate the loss.
