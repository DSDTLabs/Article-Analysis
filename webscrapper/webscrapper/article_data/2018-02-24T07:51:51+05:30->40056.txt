KOLKATA: The first rake for the   will be arriving in Kolkata by the end of March, an official in   (KMRCL) confirmed. This will be the first of 14 rakes to be supplied by BEML Ltd and the official claimed that it will be one of the most advanced in the country.

 “Most of the components procured from abroad have been fitted and the first rake is in its advanced stage of completion. We are on our toes and we hope to commission services between   stadium before the Pujas. We hope to receive delivery of the first rake by the end of March. It will take nearly 15 days to move the rake from Bengaluru to Kolkata by road. It can’t be transported by rail due to the gauge difference,” a KMRCL official said.
 
 
 While the   opted for standard gauge, tracks under Indian Railways are of the wider broad gauge. Once the first rake arrives in Kolkata, it will undergo trials before being declared fit for commercial runs. A few more rakes will arrive from Bengaluru in quick succession and KMRCL plans to start with a fleet of five some time before the Pujas.
 
 “The rakes we have ordered from BEML will be among the most advanced in the world. These will use the “communication-based train control” (CBTC) system, which will allow trains to be controlled directly from central control room. The motormen will have little to do, so far as running of the trains is concerned. However, they will control the opening and closing of doors and monitor operations to be able to take over in case of emergencies,” another official said.
