SECUNDERABAD: The Local Military Authority (LMA) is likely to reopen the remaining roads in Secunderabad cantonment that are still closed. The   has reopened only 11 of the 25 roads, which were closed four years ago. It is yet to reopen 14 roads. 

 
 
 A delegation led by Malkajgiri Lok Sabha member Ch Malla Reddy on Saturday met N Venkat Reddy, OSD to General Officer-Commanding (GOC), Telangana and Andhra Sub Area (TASA). The leaders urged the LMA to reopen the remaining roads too for the convenience of thousands of people living in colonies around AOC and other military establishments.
 
 "We have insisted that army officials reopen the roads as the ministry of defence issued orders to the effect. If the roads are not reopened by Monday, we will take up the issue with Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 29 in Delhi," Malla Reddy told STOI. 
 
 The LMA is examining feasibility of reopening of remaining 14 roads in Secunderabad Cantonment. It is gathering information from the heads of all military units, he said. 
 
 Army officials clarified that almost all the roads were reopened. Only a few internal roads where defence establishments are located are not reopened. The officials told the MP that the closed roads are used for regular parade during morning hours.
 
 He said the LMA will study the reports of unit heads and take decision. He said these roads will be kept open during the day, if not round the clock.
 
 Malla Reddy said he would continue the fight till all the roads are reopened in pursuant of the MoD's orders.
 
 Meanwhile, the LMA deployed 10 soldiers at Wellington road on Saturday morning. This is in view of the morning walkers protesting over denial of entry.
 
 On Saturday too morning walkers were stopped at Wellington Road. "We showed MoD orders but they did not allow us," said E Manoj, resident of Marredpally.
