Chandigarh: While the government of Punjab is doing its bit to promote industry in the state, Chandigarh administration seems little concerned, letting the units move to Mohali and nearby areas.

 The Punjab government in the past one year has taken several initiatives to create congenial business environment, which include providing cheap electricity to industry, reduction of collector rates and ease of doing business. It has also announced a new industry policy in which a slew of measures have been announced. On the other hand, the administration is yet to implement the industrial policy announced in 2015 and decide over long-pending demands of city industrialists.
 
 Providing power at low rates to manufacturing units was a poll promise of the Congress in 2017 Punjab Assembly election. The Amarinder Singh-led government on January 11 had issued an order to bring down the tariff to Rs 5 power unit. The state power department will bear Rs 748 crore power subsidy for the industry for the financial year 2017-18. But, the administration has proposed a steep hike up to 20%.
 
 The industrialists are already reeling under high power rate as compared to Punjab. In Chandigarh, tariff of Rs 5.35 per unit and Rs 5.65 per unit has been fixed by Joint Electricity Commission (JERC) for medium and large supply, on which the electricity department charges Rs 100 per KW as fixed charges, electricity duty at the rate of 11 paisa per unit and fuel and power purchase cost adjustment (FPPCA), which range between Re 1 and Rs 2.50 per unit. FPPCA charges, which are levied on all the categories of consumers except agriculture, are revised every quarter, resulting in heavy variation in power bills. The electricity department on February 5 had further enhanced FPPCA charges, inviting ire of the industrialists.
