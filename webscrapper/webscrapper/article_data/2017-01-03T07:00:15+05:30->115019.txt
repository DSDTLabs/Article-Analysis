MUMBAI: On New Year's Eve, which fell on a Saturday, a large segment of Mumbai's partying crowd was at weekend getaways: nearby hill stations and beaches. The day was also the occasion of the PM's much-anticipated speech on 50 days of demonetisation. Naturally, many remained glued to their TV sets. The result was that liquor consumption at bars and hotels was driven down by 30% on December 31 as compared to the previous year.

 The estimate is by  , an association of over 8,000 bars, hotels and restaurants in Mumbai. Its president,   , said waiters in many hotels and bars ran pillar to post to meet delivery orders as many partied at home. Hoteliers said the PM's speech delayed New Year's Eve events and affected attendance at bars and clubs.
 
 A top court decision to not allow hotels, societies and clubs on highways and within 500 meters of them to hold liquor parties also affected consumption. At the eleventh hour, the excise department did allow such hotels and bars to extend parties scheduled in permit rooms to banquet areas between 8pm and 5am, but the prevailing confusion had already played dampened spirits.
 
 Meanwhile, the excise department confiscated illicit liquor stock worth over Rs 1 crore, including around Rs 32 lakh in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region on New Year's Eve. This included 190 bags of toddy mixed with a poisonous substance.
