Thanjavur: The formation of the Cauvery management board (CMB) can be expected only after assembly election in Karnataka is over, general secretary of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, T T V Dhinakaran said in Thanjavur on Saturday. 

 “Tamil Nadu people cannot expect the board before the elections in Karnataka. The state government should have filed a review petition over the water share given in the Supreme Court order. The government should have pointed out the salinity of the water which cannot be utilised for agriculture,” Dhinakaran told reporters. 
 
 On the ‘reduction’ of central funds to Tamil Nadu government, Dhinakaran said, “The central government has decreased the funds by 90% for Tamil Nadu. But the rulers in the state remained silent on the issue without opposing it. In fact, the reduction of funds was the result of development of the state under the rules of MGR and Jayalalithaa. So, the BJP should understand the fact that Tamil Nadu saw the progress during the Dravidian rule.”
 
 Criticising the ruling AIADMK an anti-people government, he exuded confidence that the judgement in the 18 MLAs disqualification case will be in his favour.
 
 Dhinakaran has been staying in Thanjavur for the past few days following the death of Sasikala’s husband, M Natarajan.
