LUCKNOW: Sunni cleric Maulana Salman   will form an inter-faith organization next month to find an amicable settlement of the   dispute. The first meeting of the organisation, to be called  , will be held in Lucknow on March 8. 

 It will have representation from people from across religions and sects who support Nadwi's formula for Ramjanmbhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. 
 
 Nadwi was expelled from the   (AIMPLB) earlier this month for proposing an out-of-court settlement of the Ayodhya dispute. Nadwi's proposal came after his meeting with Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishanker, who, too, is mediating in Ayodhya dispute. The cleric will hold discussions with   in Lucknow on March 1 to decide the future course of action. Nadwi has sent out an appeal to people to join him, having put out his email id and numbers to connect with him for the cause. "Thousands of people called me and told me they supported my formula to end the Ayodhya dispute, calling it truly the only way forward. So it was decided to get all these people together in the form of an organisation. I will invite religious heads of all denominations and it will then be decided on March 8 as to how to take it further," said Maulana Nadwi.
