GURUGRAM:   of   1 have complained of contaminated water supply for the past 10 days. According to residents, blocks C and C1 of the society have been getting water, emanating a foul odour.   officials, however, said there were no problems from their end.

 One resident said her daughter contracted a water-borne infection after consuming water. “My daughter has fallen ill due to the dirty water. She now requires hospitalisation,” said  , who lives in Block C.
 
 Residents said over 500 homes in blocks C and C1 are reeling under the problem. They said they had spoken to MCG about the matter and the officials had promised speedy action, but nothing had changed. 
 
 “We spoke to a few MCG officials. They assured us that the matter would be taken care of, but it doesn’t look like anything has been done. On the contrary, the water is getting more polluted by the day,” said Kiran, another resident.
 
 “We are boiling the water we get and then transferring it to RO filters. We are using packaged drinking water even for bathing and other domestic purposes. The situation is very dire here, but the authorities don’t seem to be doing anything about it,” she added.
 
 When TOI contacted an MCG official, he said the water supply was fine from their end. “There’s no problem from our side. If there’s any problem, it is from Huda’s end,” he said.
 
 Despite several attempts,   officials could not be reached for comment.
