CHANDIGARH: Gangsters   ‘Baba’ and Sampat Nehra, who have claimed responsibility of shooting at   and director Parmish Verma now, are on the UT and Panchkula police list of most wanted criminals. Dilpreet Singh shot into notoriety when his video of killing Hoshiarpur’s Khurdan village sarpanch Satnam Singh outside the Sector-38-West gurdwara in Chandigarh went viral.

 He had two other people—   ‘Rinda’ and   ‘Akash’—as partners in this broad daylight murder on April 10, 2017. Satnam Singh had come to a religious programme at the gurdwara. In the video, Dilpreet Singh was caught firing at him several times in full public view. Satnam Singh was moved to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), where he succumbed to his bullet injuries. Chandigarh police then registered a case against Dilpreet Singh, Harvinder Singh, and Harjinder Singh before, later, declaring a cash reward of Rs 50,000 on any information about them. On the run since, Dilpreet Singh has become most wanted now.
 
 Nehra is wanted even in Panchkula, where his gang had stormed the Sector-6 government hospital firing in their air on June 6, 2017, and freed prisoner under trail Deepak by spraying red chilli powder into the eyes of the latter’s three police guards in broad daylight. In December 2016 before that, Nehra had also shot at a Mohali resident in Chandigarh’s Sector 27, after which Chandigarh Police had announced a bounty of Rs 25,000 for any tip-off about him. Nehra, who joined the gang of Student Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU) former leader Lawrence Bishnoi, is son of an assistant sub-Inspector (ASI) of Chandigarh Police.
