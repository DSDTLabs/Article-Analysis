VADODARA: A group of students of M S University’s   have demanded restarting providing subject change option to first year (FY) Bachelors of Arts (BA) students from the academic year – 2018-19. 

 The students, who have submitted an application to faculty dean, said that many FY BA students are presently facing problems because they are not given the option of changing subjects. Till 2013-14, they were given a chance to change their subjects after a month of the admission. 
 
 “This used to help students shift to other subjects which suited their intelligence and abilities,” said  , an FY BA student. “However, from 2014-15 students are not getting this option. Many students take up subjects which do not suit their abilities by mistake or due to lack of awareness and understanding of the subjects at the time of admission,” he said.
 
 Repeated ATKTs in subjects considered to be “hard” in semester one and semester 2 is also deterring students from taking admission in the third year. 
 
 “Many students who have earlier studied in Hindi, Gujarati, English and Bengali mediums face problems in subjects like statistics, maths, German, geography,” he said. Students have urged the faculty to form a subject change committee which can scrutinise applications received from such students and later decide on case to case basis.
