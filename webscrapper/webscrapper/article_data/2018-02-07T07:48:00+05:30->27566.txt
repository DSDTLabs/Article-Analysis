Ludhiana: A 60-year-old tailor from Daresi, Om Chand, committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan on Tuesday. It is alleged that the elderly man was depressed, following a dispute with the shop owner. 

 Omâ€™s son Subhash Kumar said his father was a tailor working in a rented shop for the past many years. Recently, shop owners told him to vacate the shop, due to which he was in depression. He added that on Tuesday morning, his father left for the shop, which was in the same locality. There, he hanged himself from the ceiling fan. Some time later, a neighbour saw him hanging in the shop and raised an alarm.
 
 An official from Daresi police said the police had proceeded with Section 174 of CrPC on the statement of Subhash. The body was handed over to the family after post-mortem.
