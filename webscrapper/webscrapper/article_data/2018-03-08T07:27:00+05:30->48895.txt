Chandigarh: Haryana governor Kaptan Singh Solanki on Wednesday launched a   book titled ‘History and Heritage, Government College of Art (INDIA)’ at Museum and Art Gallery in Sector 10 here.

 The book that is based on 140 years of art, education, history and heritage of the Government College of Art (GCA) has been compiled and written by D S Kapoor -- former principal of the GCA. At the launch, it was stated that the book offers a window into the creative history and progression of the college, which was formerly known as Mayo College of Art.
 
 The book in the words of the author is a tribute to his alma mater, GCA, where he was once a student and later a teacher.
 
 “Alma mater means benign mother. Hence, one’s school and college is a benign mother that grooms us to face challenges in life. This realisation has been at the core of this book. Therefore, a desire started to take root in my mind to bring forth the history of this institution, garnished with bio-sketches of important personalities associated with it,” Kapoor said.
 
 Kapoor added that GCA (Government College of Art) was started by John Lockwood Kipling about 140 years ago at Lahore in 1875 with the name of Mayo College of Art. “However, with the exodus, following the partition in 1947, the institute was brought to India and with the establishment of Chandigarh in 1962, it was brought to the city and renamed,” he said.
 
 Kapoor said he began the work on his book in 2009. “I had to travel extensively to meet eminent students, scholars, teachers and students associated with the college,” he added.
