CHENNAI: Director A L Vijay alias   and actor  , who married in 2014, are now officially no longer man and wife, with a family court here on Tuesday granting them a divorce — bereft of any obvious hostility — to the Kollywood couple

 The divorce proceedings were, as court observers noted, smooth and not aggressive in the least.
 
 The actor, whose marriage to Vijay in a grand ceremony in Chennai on June 12, 2014, created a buzz in K-Town, filed for divorce in August, 2016, after the director stated breach of trust as the reason for the couple to part ways. Vijay and Amala filed for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13 (b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Following the petition, the court provided them with the statutory six-month period of separation.
 
 According to both the actor and director, they fell in love while working on the movie ‘Deiva Thirumagal’. Their relationship grew closer and they were engaged in Aluva, Kochi.
 
 While Amala Paul maintained silence after filing for divorce, Vijay’s father A L Alagappan said Vijay appeared upset with Amala over her decision to continue to act in movies after marriage. Kollywood’s hyperactive grapewine had it that Vijay was upset because she reportedly said she would stop acting but kept signing films.
 
 The couple, who do not have a child, said they had been living separately since March 3, 2015.
 
 On Tuesday, II additional principal family court judge Irusan Poonguzhali granted the decree of divorce as the couple had completed the separation period.
 
 Amala Paul made her debut in Tamil film ‘Veerasekaran’ and acted in films like ‘Sindhu Samaveli’, ‘Mynaa’, ‘Velaiilla Pattadhari’. Vijay, the son of producer A L Alagappan, directed a couple of her films.
