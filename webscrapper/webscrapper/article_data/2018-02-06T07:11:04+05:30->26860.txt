CHANDIGARH: The   urban local bodies department is planning to extend the exemption from property tax in villages falling under its jurisdiction for another two years. According to information, there are around 350 villages under nine municipal corporations, 14 municipal councils and 53 municipal committees in the state.

 The villages fall under the jurisdiction of corporations and councils only. Officials informed that nearly 40,000 families will benefit from the move.
 
 According to information, in March 2016, chief minister   had announced extension of exemption for the assessees of property tax and fire cess for families living in villages that had come under civic bodies. The deadline of the exemption is ending on March 31.
 
 Sources said since the state would be getting into the election mode, the urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain also expedited the process.
 
 When contacted, Jain said the proposal had been made on the basis of representation made by representatives of local and civic bodies across Haryana. “We are hopeful of getting the go-ahead from the chief minister’s office ( ) as officers are working on the proposal. It comes along with the development plans of villages and plan of action for the implementation,” said Jain.
 
 Meanwhile, various resident bodies have welcomed the initiative taken by the department. “This has to be done as residents of rural areas don’t avail any facility of being part of the civic bodies. The government should rather come out with special incentives for the residents of villages,” said Dhanender Walia, former chairman of   zila parishad and husband of Panchkula mayor Upender Walia.
