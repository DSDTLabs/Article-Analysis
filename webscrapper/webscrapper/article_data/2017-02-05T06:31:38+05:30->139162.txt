CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu will bounce back to its earlier position after slipping to 18th from 12th in the central government rankings on the ease of doing business released last November, said state minister for education, sports and youth welfare K  .

 “The state had to deal with a lot of issues: The death of our former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, the transition of power and subsequent new working ways.The state could not comply with certain requirements.It was a technical issue and does not really reflect the state's economic or industrial prowess,“ said the minister referring to the list released by   of the Union ministry of commerce and industry.
 
 Tamil Nadu slipped even lower than Bihar and with score of 62.8% was way below   (98.78%) and Karnataka (88.39%). The key reform areas for Tamil Nadu were obtaining construction permits, electricity connec tions, registrations, licensing and availability of land.
 
 “Tamil Nadu as a state has always been pro-business. Even with the introduction of GST, we will continue being pro-investment and tax-friendly,“ said Pandiarajan at an event organised by CII in the city.
 
 Pandiarajan said his department planned to build a heritage museum in Coimbatore on a public-private partnership. “Corporates have come forward to contribute `2 crore and the government will contribute the same,“ he said.
