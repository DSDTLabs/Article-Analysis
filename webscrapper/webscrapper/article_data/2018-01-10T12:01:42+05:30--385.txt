HYDERABAD: Two tigers have been reportedly sighted in the   in Nagarkurnool district even as forest officials are busy preparing for the mega task of counting the big cats and select wild animals during a week-long exercise from Jan 22. 

 The tigers allegedly attacked and killed a few goats at   in   mandal of the district. The goats belonged to a tribal farmer, Lavudya Eswar  , who had tied them in a compound abutting his agricultural field. 
 
 Naik told local media that two goats had died while four others are missing. However, senior forest officials believe that it was a wolf that killed the goats.
 
 The reported sighting of the tigers has created enthusiasm among wildlife activists ahead of the forest census. Field staff who visited the attack site declared that two tigers had strolled into the area. They came to this conclusion based on the pug marks. But the report of the lower staff was disputed by senior officials.
 
 Nagarkurnool divisional forest officer told TOI that the field staff had mistaken the pug marks for those of a tiger. "It was a wolf that attacked the goats," he said. 
 
 Forest officials collected the carcass of the goats for postmortem examination to ascertain the cause of death and identify the wild animal responsible. Forest department pays compensation to people who lose their cattle and goats in attacks by wild animals. Even damage to crops is compensated.
