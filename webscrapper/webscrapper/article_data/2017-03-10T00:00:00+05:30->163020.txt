Madhu Daithota

 All roads in town led to Shilpa Ganesh’s home for Women’s Day. The SWAG (Sandalwood Wives & Girlfriends) set chose to live up their big day at   — Ganesh and Shilpa’s abode — and the group had a rollicking time. The event saw the star wives doing a potluck with everyone having rustled up their signature dishes and treating their besties to it. The men, in the true spirit of the day, chose to stay back and look after the kids so that their women had a day good time. Ganesh and Prajwal Devaraj made a brief appearance to wish the ladies. The latest member to join the SWAG set,  , also made her presence felt and her baked goodies were a huge hit, we hear. Spotted at the do were Priyanka Upendra, Malavika Avinash, Jyothi Akul, Harshika Poonacha, Vidya Sriimurali, Sangeetha Ravishanker,  , Ragini Chandran, Archana Ramesh, Jyothi Prem, Rekha Jagadish, Samyukta Hornad, Sudharani, Keerthi, Nabha Natesh and others.
