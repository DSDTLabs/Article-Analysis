 wanted to release his next,  , in time for Mother’s Day, but owing to the state elections, he couldn’t realise this plan. But since Mother’s Day is special to the team, given the theme of the film, they released a song, which is their tribute to mothers everywhere, thereby also kickstarting the promotions for the film.
“People usually start the promotions of the film with a teaser or first look, but since this film is centered on a mother, we decided to come up with a tribute on Mother’s Day. It is not just a film promo; it’s a Mother’s Day special and is for anyone who wants to wish his/her mother. Yogi (producer   Dwarakish) came up with this idea and when Chiru ( ) read what I had written, he thought that Dhruva’s (Sarja) voice would be a good fit. Dhruva then recorded the song. After (music director)   heard it, he used the first two lines of the theme song of our film at the end of this number. So, it’s a combination of all our efforts,” says Chaitanya. And it is this team work that has Chaitanya, Chiranjeevi and Yogish working for the third time together in Amma I Love You — Dwarakish Chitra’s 51st production.
 “All three of us sync well, are sensible people and we are trying to make good Kannada films. Although one is a big star, the other a big director and the third a big producer, there is no ego between us. We don’t compete with each other and it’s never about who is better. It’s not about who takes a call, but what call we take together. There is unity, understanding and mutual discretion, because we respect each other. All this makes this professional relationship a very loveable one,” says Yogish.
