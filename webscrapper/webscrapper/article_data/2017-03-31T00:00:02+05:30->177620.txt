Hyderabad: In a bid to engage with the startup ecosystem in Hyderabad, auditing firm PwC India on Thursday inaugurated its first innovation hub in the country at the T-Hub in Hyderabad.

 Explaining the kind of work that will be done at its 10-seater innovation hub, Murali Talasila, PwC partner and innovation leader, said, “It is a multi-dimensional relationship. We will be engaging with startups to accelerate their growth trajectory. Suppose they want to access a company where they think their solutions will solve problems, we will be the bridge as we have the who’s who of India Inc as our clients.” 
 
 While Talasila said that PwC will not be charging startups for this service, he clarified that in cases where corporates reach out to PwC with certain problems that can be solved by startups, PwC will connect them to the relevant startups and monetise this service. TNN
