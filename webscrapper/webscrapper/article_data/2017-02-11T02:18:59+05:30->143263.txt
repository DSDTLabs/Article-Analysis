NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday directed that no   will be allowed to ply in   from April 1.

 A bench led by Justice B D Ahmed and Justice Ashutosh Kumar extended the time for registration of cycle   till March 31 by the corporation. The civic body is conducting a camp in this regard in coordination with NGO Manushi Sangathan. HCâ€™s directions came while hearing a PIL filed by the NGO on the issue of redevelopment of the walled city and creation of non-motorised vehicle lanes. It had earlier asked the corporation and Manushi to find out if owners of cycle rickshaws plying in the area are willing to register their vehicles and obtain licences.
 
 After they reported that owners were willing to get registered, the court had ordered that a camp must be conducted to facilitate their obtaining licences to ply within the area.
