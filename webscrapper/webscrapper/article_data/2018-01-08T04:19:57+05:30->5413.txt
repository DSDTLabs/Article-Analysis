NEW DELHI:   and fatalities due to   and mist have increased significantly over the past three years. While 16 people were killed daily in such accidents in 2014, it increased to 21 in 2015 while in 2016, more than 25 people died in similar crashes every day, according to the latest report of   transport ministry.

 
 Only Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Haryana put together had more than half of the total fog and mist-related road fatalities in 2016. Data show while fog-related deaths in UP decreased in 2016 as compared to the previous year, such fatalities increased five times in Haryana.
 
 Government officials said since all these accidents and deaths happen in two-three months, there is a need to put special focus on managing the crisis. “Two factors-—missing lane marking, signages, signals and weak enforcement— are primarily response for the bloodbath on our roads. The three necessary features on our roads to guide drivers are missing and there is no enforcement on our highways, which account for 65% of the total road deaths,” road safety expert Rohit Baluja said.
 
 
  
 
 Even transport ministry officials admit that proper lane marking and signages on roads can address the unsafe driving condition.
 
 “We have no consideration for changes in the environment. The drivers are little aware what precautions they need to take and they commit the same mistake of speeding even after going through reports about vehicle pile up due to dense fog,” Baluja added.
 
 Taking note of the need to have more enforcement to prevent such fatal crashes, the Punjab and Haryana High Court in November 2015 had issued a slew of directions including deployment of more police along stretches where more than three road deaths had happened and putting speed breakers to slow down the vehicles.
