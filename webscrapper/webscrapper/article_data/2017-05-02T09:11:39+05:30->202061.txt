  Congress has been desperately trying to reclaim its lost ground among the Tribals and, hence, the first election rally in Dediapada, a Tribal-dominated area in Narmada district. But political analysts here feel the task is far from easy as the grand old party is ridden with factionalism in the state.
  
  Congress currently holds 16 out of the 27 seats reserved for the Scheduled Tribes in Gujarat, while BJP holds 10 and one is with JDU. But the party is fast losing its support among Tribals. As a matter of fact, Dediapada, once a Congress bastion, is now held by BJP. The constituency moved from JDU in 2002 to Congress again in 2007 and to BJP in 2012.
  
  Congress had recently replaced its Gujarat in-charge   with former Rajasthan chief minister  . According to party insiders, Kamath has been a casualty of the infighting within the state unit of the party. When Kamat had met Vaghela at his residence, 36 out of 57 Congress MLAs had demanded that Vaghela be declared as the chief ministerial candidate.
  
  Addressing a public rally in Dediapada on the culmination of party’s Adivasi Yatra, the Congress vice-president said: “If elected to power, Congress will not speak it’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’, but first understand people’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and then work accordingly.” “Our government will try to build Gujarat after coming to power. The Congress will fight this election with full force and defeat BJP here,” he added.
  
  It may be mentioned here that senior Cong re s s l e a d e r Shankersinh Vaghela had earlier said that Congress was looking at winning 108 out of 182 seats in the forthcoming assembly polls. But it will be a herculean task as workers says party is fast losing its groundswell.
