HYDERABAD: The presence of mind of two observant cops saved the life of a 22-year-old engineering student. The girl was attempting to commit suicide under the   limits two days ago, but was counselled into abandoning the idea by the policemen. 

 The two police constables - Narsing   and DA Kumar - were on patrolling duty on Sunday afternoon when they spotted the girl standing on the divider in the middle of the road near   flyover. "It was between 2.30 and 3pm when we were patrolling on the main road. We saw the girl crying on the divider. The stretch is very dangerous as it is near the flyover and vehicles keep speeding," said Rao. 
 
 The girl, who hails from Khammam district and studies in a college in the city, was preparing to jump in front of a speeding vehicle when the policemen intervened.
 
 "We first took her away from the main road. She told us about her boyfriend who she wants to marry. But both his and her parents do not approve of their relationship. Frustrated with the situation, she wanted to end her life," the constable said. 
 
 The policemen spent nearly two hours counselling the girl even as curious passersby started gathering.
 
 "We asked her to think about her parents. We gave her coconut water as she was exhausted. Her eyes were red with crying. We asked her not to take any extreme steps without thinking about her family," said Rao. Finally, the girl changed her mind and left for her hostel after thanking the cops.
