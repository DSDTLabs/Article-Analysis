PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Lonavla police on Saturday decided to ban entry of tourists to the steps of the Bhushi dam due to the overflowing of water as it may lead to accidents.

 Heavy rain in Lonavla, Khandala and Maval for the last three days has significantly increased the water level, thereby, leading to overflow of water on the steps.
 
 Due to the huge influx of tourists and the resultant traffic jam because of haphazard parking of vehicles, the Lonavla Municipal Council(LMC) and forest department have identified spots for constructing parking areas.
 
 Recently, the Lonavla police decided to ban private vehicles from going towards Bhushi dam after 3pm on weekends. This has led to tourists travelling to Pavana dam, Karla and Bhaja caves, Lohagad, Tikona and Visapur, causing traffic congestion and affecting business in Lonavla.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Surekha Jadhav, president of LMC, said, “The economy of the town is dependent on tourists arriving in the monsoon. We want to provide them adequate parking space.”
 
 Jadhav added, “We informed the police that LMC will make arrangements for parking lots in various parts of the town and surrounding areas. We have identified over 28 spots on the road going towards Bhushi dam.”
 
 Azhar Contractor, the president of Lonavla Hotel Association, said, “Many tourists cancelled their plan to visit Lonavla after the vehicle ban. This affected hotels and restaurants in the town. We hope that the LMC will acquire plots and turn them into parking space.”
 
 The sub-divisional officer of Maval taluka,  , said, “We have directed the private parking space operators to put up relevant sign boards and charge a uniform amount of Rs 100 for the entire day.”
