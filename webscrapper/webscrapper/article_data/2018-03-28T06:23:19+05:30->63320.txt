PANAJI: The   (GSPCB) on Tuesday rejected the application of   ( ) for consent to operate various cargoes at its mooring dolphin facility due to non-availability of an environmental clearance (EC). Earlier, the port used to handle coal operations at the mooring dolphin.

 The port had proposed to handle pig iron, limestone, bauxite, break bulk cargo, iron ore pellets and sand at the mooring dolphin, which is MPT’s offshore cargo handling facility. 
 
 GSPCB chairman   told TOI that the application was rejected because MPT does not possess valid a EC to handle the various cargoes.
 
 Earlier, the board had directed the MPT to carry out a study through a centre of excellence. It sought that air pollution modelling be undertaken to ascertain the likely impact of dusty cargo at the mooring dolphin facility, while also prescribing remedial pollution control measures for such types of cargo handling, within a period of three months.
 
 Earlier, the board had rejected the MPT’s application for consent to operate. Subsequently, the port had applied afresh for permission to handle the new cargoes.
 
 The earlier application was rejected as the MPT was found to be unable to adopt any pollution control measures. Official sources said that as of now, there is no clarity on MPT’s plan to implement these measures.
