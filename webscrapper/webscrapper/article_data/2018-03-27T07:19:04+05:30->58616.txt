HYDERABAD: Nearly 4.2 lakh people in the state are poised to get access to safe potable   by 2019 as part of an international project underway that saw the 100
  iJal safe water station being launched on Monday for 1063 households at   in Jagtial district.

 
  
  
 So far, 3.3 lakh people in the state have access to water sans fluorides, bio or industrial wastes from iJal safe water stations. But this is less than 2% of the state’s rural population.
 
 The project is being implemented jointly by international non-profit organization Safe Water Network (SWN), and  , which is providing between ₹15-25 lakh towards each water station as apart of its   obligations.
 
 By 2019, 30 more stations, with six-level filtration technology, including reverse osmosis and UV filtration are in the offing, said   president Vikas Chadha.
 
 Of the 100 existing water stations, five are at Malakpet and Tadbund, Hyderabad, while the other 95 are at Karimnagar, Adilabad, Warangal rural and urban, Jayashankar, Mahabubabad, Jagtiyal, Peddapalli, Badradari, Mancherial, Suryapet, Khammam and Medak. All stations are equipped with water ATMs. Water can be procured via RFID cards, while 20 litres of water can be collected manually by paying ₹5.
 
 “We interacted with villagers in Telangana and conducted a three-year study on their attitudes towards paying medical bills and nominal charges for safe drinking water. The quality of water in Telangana has improved compared to UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka where we are also doing similar projects,” said Kurt  , CEO, SWN.
 
 “Earlier, 90% of those coming to the water stations were women but now 75% of those coming to fetch water for their families are men soour project has also led to a change in social behaviour,” Soderlund added.
