Vadodara:   clearly is worried about Australia’s long batting line but the biggest worry for the Indian vice captain ahead of the of the three-match series is that of the return of the visiting captain  .

 
 
 “The Aussies bat deep down the order. We have plans for every player but our focus will be on Meg and Perry (Ellyse) who have performed well against us in the past,” Kaur said. Though India’s strength is its top order batting, Kaur hopes the middle order pulls in its weight. Coach   too admitted that their batting down the order is bit weak. “Our lower order batting too needs to bat well,” Arothe said. He said he has worked on the inconsistency of Indian team fielding. When asked about absence of their key bowler, Jhulan Goswami, Arothe said that Deepti Sharma and   will have to carry all the weight.
 
 
 Lanning, said, “The World Cup loss against India last year hurt us. But we are in a much better space now. India has been playing a good cricket and we are looking forward to test our skills.” After being out of the game due to an injury, she hit the form in a match against India A three days ago in Mumbai.
