CHANDIGARH: Taking cognizance of a petition filed by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday asked the   (EC) to ensure complete security of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) in Punjab.

 “Security of EVMs is not only the mandate of the statute empowering and obligating the commission to do so but is also essential to uphold the sanctity of the electoral process besides being propelled by the concerns of all including this court to instill confidence; sustain and enhance the credibility of the electoral process so inherent to a democracy,” observed the HC.
 
 A division bench comprising Justice   and Justice Sneh Prashar also asked the EC to take note of some suggestions made by the petitioner party to ensure security of the EVMs and take appropriate steps.
 
 The suggestions of the petitioner were more or less in conformity with the standards operating procedures and if some of them supplement and strengthen the same, they may be accepted, particularly, if they sub serve the purpose of securing the electronic voting machines, observed the bench.
 
 In its petition, AAP had raised the concerns of protecting EVMs in Punjab during the interregnum when the election results were awaited to be announced on March 11. Some of the steps suggested by APP before the bench included: to ensure that no unauthorized person (including the staff) is allowed in the middle perimeter of the strong rooms, to ensure that in the outer perimeter, only persons with valid ID cards and authorization are allowed to enter and to make suitable arrangements for CCTV monitored any entry/exit from the outer perimeter inwards, which should be visible to candidates/their agents.
 
 Other suggestions included making suitable arrangements to enable candidates and/or their authorized representatives to be stationed within visible distance and straight vision from the seal of the inner perimeter and to take all possible steps to ensure complete safety and security of the EVMs.
