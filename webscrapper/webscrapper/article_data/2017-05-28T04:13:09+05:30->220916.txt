GURUGRAM: The state education department has roped in village panchayats and police in a bid to provide adequate security to schoolgoing girls. 

 The decision comes after girls from nine districts in Haryana demanded that their schools be upgraded to Class XII so that they don’t have to travel to other villages to attend school, where they often face harassment and feel unsafe.
 
 On May 10, 83 girls from Gothda Tappa Dahina village in   went on an indefinite hunger strike, demanding upgrade of their school. The Haryana government finally gave in and the protesting girls ended their fast on May 17. This was followed by a similar protest at the government school in   where 200 students demanded that their school be upgraded to Class XII, which got a nod from Chandigarh.
 
 Since then, similar protests have taken place at Rewari, Rohtak, Gurgaon, Jhajjar, Mahendragarh, Hissar, Jind Palwal and Sonipat districts. 
 
 In response, the education department said it wouldn’t be feasible to upgrade all schools at such a short notice. Instead, the department has decided that a committee be formed in every school to ensure the girls’ safety.
 
 According to norms, a high school must have at least 150 students in classes IX and X for it to be upgraded to Class XII. Therefore, it has now been decided that a ‘Balika Suraksha Samiti’ (Girl Safety Committee) be formed in all 14,000 government schools in Haryana. The education department, development and panchayat department and police will work jointly for this. A meeting was held on Thursday in which planning was done to prepare a draft and implement it across Haryana.
 
 A senior official told TOI that the committee would have three members — school principal, a lady teacher and a woman panchayat member.
 
 P K Das, additional chief secretary, education department, said society at large needed to be made safer for the girls, who have to go to college and to work outside the village some time in their lives.
