NEW DELHI:   president   met RJD chief   at  , where the former Bihar chief minister was undergoing treatment till Monday.

 
 Taking time out of a busy schedule marked by intense campaigning for Karnataka assembly elections, Gandhi met the   (RJD) chief at his private room at the hospital for a few minutes and exchanged notes, Congress sources said.
 
 In their half-hour meeting, Gandhi discussed his health condition, they added.
 
 The meeting marks a new turn in the the equations between the two. Rahul had torn off an ordinance drafted by UPA with the objective to save convicted politicians like Lalu from being barred from contesting polls. However, Congress aligned itself with Lalu for 2015 polls and Rahul recently met with Tejashwi, who is seen as RJD bossâ€™s political heir.
 
 Interestingly, it transpired later that then President Pranab Mukherjee had returned the ordinance in question to UPA government before it was torn off.
 
 Prasad, who is serving mutiple jail terms in fodder scam-related cases, was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on March 29 and discharged on Monday after the hospital said his condition had improved.
 
 The former chief minister has been convicted in four fodder scam cases since 2013 -- the latest being the Dumka treasury case in which a special CBI court sentenced him to 14 years in jail.
