INDORE: Mhow sub-divisional magistrate on Thursday sealed a college’s office upon its failure to pay land diversion tax amounting to Rs 22.65 lakh that had been pending for the last 6 years.

 “There was a diversion tax that had been pending against BM group of colleges in   village in Simrol Tehsil, which they had not cleared since 2011 despite a number of notices being sent to them,” SDM,   told TOI.
 
 A revenue team led by Naib tehsildar, KL Jain reached the campus with a final call that the institute submit the pending tax or face being sealed off. “As the staff showed helplessness over paying the due amount, the team asked them to vacate the office so that it could be sealed off,” Jain said. It’s only after the   authority gave a cheque of Rs 5.23 lakh against the due tax and agreed to clear the remaining amount by the end of March 2017 that the team removed the seals from the office’s door.
