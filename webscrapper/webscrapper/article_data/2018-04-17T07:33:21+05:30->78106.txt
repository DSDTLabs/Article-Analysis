BENGALURU: What would one be doing in life at the age of 42? Riding a   across 24 countries! Yes, two Bengaluru based-businessmen are doing just that. They started their journey to London early on Monday, aiming to cover over 25,000km in 90 days.

  C, a businessman, and King  , who owns a factory, both aged 42, are part of White Dragon adventures and have been long-distance bikers for five years. Burdened by their work schedules which after a point was monetarily satisfying but not mentally — they decided to make biking their hobby.
 
 “We rode to   in 2016 and travelled to Singapore in a car. But we didn’t find the Singapore journey as thrilling as the bike ride. So, we decided to tour the world on our bikes. The London journey will be a part of the first leg of our world tour.” said Manjunath.
 
 “We aim to cover 500-600km every day, and take a break once in four or five days. That way, it’d take 80-90 days to reach London,” said Manjunath. Their families will take care of their business during this time.
