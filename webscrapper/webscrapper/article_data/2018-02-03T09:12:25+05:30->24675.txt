LUDHIANA: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal   has imposed a   of Rs 4,000 on a fashion store for overcharging Rs 295 on a pair of trousers. The forum — comprising its president  , and member   — directed   at M/s Chawla Fashions, Westend Mall, Ferozepur Road, through its manager/proprietor to refund the excess charged amount of Rs 295 with interest at 6% per annum with effect from 30 October 2014 until payment, apart from compensation for mental harassment and agony of Rs 2,000, and litigation expenses of Rs 2,000 in favour of the complainant   (48) of Kundanpuri in Civil Lines.

 As per the complaint,   — on the eve of the birthday of his minor son — purchased a pair of trousers on 30 October 2014 from One Arrow Store, and was offered discount of 40% on the price. 
 
 The MRP of the product was Rs 2,099 (inclusive of all taxes), but despite that, a VAT amount of Rs 295 was alleged to be charged in excess. Despite sending an e-mail on 9 September 2016, the amount was not refunded, and as such, by pleading deficiency in service, a prayer was made for directing the opposite parties to refund the excess charged amount of Rs 295, along with interest amount of Rs 100 thereon. 
 
 Compensation of Rs 40,000, along with litigation expenses of Rs 11,000 and punitive and exemplary costs of Rs 45,000 more were claimed. Arrow Store was alleged to be engaged in selling the products of Arvind Lyfestyle Brand Limited, Bengaluru; and Banswara Garments, Daman; and that is why, the complainant alleged the latter two had also become a party to the case. The forum, however, said only Arrow Store that sold the products to the complainant, could be faulted for the overcharge.
 
 The forum observed that though the MRP of the product purchased by Sunil was Rs 2,099 (inclusive of all taxes), as disclosed by the contents of the document, after going through retail invoice, it was made out as if 40% discount was granted, which was not denied in the written statement filed by the opposite parties. “
