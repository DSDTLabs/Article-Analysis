BENGALURU: Heaving a sigh of relief over what they described as incident-free New Year celebrations in the city, Bengaluru police on Monday said they received no complaints of sexual harassment and molestation during the revelry. 

 "Till now, we haven't received any such complaints. No cases have been filed in any police station across the city," police commissioner T   said, adding, "Four men were arrested for pickpocketing while at least 20 men, who were inebriated and creating a nuisance for women revellers, were detained." Police were on high alert across the city during the celebrations, in the wake of multiple incidents of alleged molestation during last year's revelry. 
 
 Leaving no stone unturned, police played good   on Sunday by dropping home revellers, mostly women and children, who were seen stranded by the roadside as cabs and autorickshaws were difficult to get.
 
  Staff of  , the women police patrol vehicles, were assigned the responsibility of transporting women and children to their destinations. Other  , too, were deployed to drop families with veterans and elders. 
 
  "The time after the crowds disperse is most important. Motorists speed and chances of miscreants targeting their quarries is high. We made sure that women and children were moved to safe zones and transported later," he said. DCPs from different divisions, too, made sure that Hoysalas attended to stranded revellers. 
 
  Senior police officials said the heightened presence of policemen, including a fair sprinkling of policewomen, drones, real-time monitoring of revelry on giant TV screens on MG Road, cops in reflectors, the closing of Brigade Road and Church Street stretches, and allowing vehicles on   through the night to ensure that the crowds were restricted to pavements, ensured that the celebrations did not turn troublesome.
