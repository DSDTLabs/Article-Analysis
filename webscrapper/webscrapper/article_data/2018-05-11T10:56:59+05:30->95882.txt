KOTTAYAM:   (M) chief K M Mani, through an article in the party's mouthpiece  , has lauded the measures taken by chief minister   to ban 'nokkukooli' in the state.

 "The ban of nokkukooli by Pinarayi is a welcome move. It is a change of policy. Pinarayi took a stand against nokkukooli even when he was the party secretary," said Mani. He also lauded Pinarayi for bringing peace and an atmosphere for development in the state through the ban.
 
 Even before the steering committee meeting, Mani had indicated that he would direct the party followers to vote according to their conscience in Chengannur. And in a clever move, he has revealed his mind through the article. 
 
 However, the stand that will be taken by Joseph and his men will be crucial on Friday. Though, eight out of the 14 district presidents of the party are with Mani, he is unlikely to take an open stand supporting the LDF. He is aware that such a move will lead to a split in the party. tnn
