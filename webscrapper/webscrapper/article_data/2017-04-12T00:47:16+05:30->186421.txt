 “‘Rasi’ stands for Ra Chinnathambi, Vijayabaskar’s father,” said a close associate of Vijayabaskar. License was issued to Rasi Blue Metals to extract quarry rock till 2018. Functioning for the past 15 years, the quarry has over a 100 people working on a daily basis to extract quarry rock. “Started on a 2-3 acre area, it is now spread across 300 acres including the Valayankulam, Kanakankulam and Anaivizhunthankulam tanks,” said a local on condition of anonymity.
 
 These tanks were a source of irrigation for farmers in the vicinity. However, with the expansion of the quarry, they have disappeared.
