GHAZIABAD: The   is planning to construct a   nearly 150 metres away from the   at the starting point of the elevated road near   to avoid a ‘jam point’ on the road where the traffic merges. “While conducting a survey, we realized that a spot along rotary may become a ‘jam point’ as the traffic from three roads will converge here. So we are planning to build a U-turn 150 metres away from rotary on the stretch leading to GT Road,” said V N Singh, chief engineer, GDA.

 This “design flaw” was detected when the officials were doing last-minute survey before the grand opening of the elevated road. It also comes at a time when the GDA got environmental clearance from the   (SEIAA).
 
 However, GDA officials sought to underplay the issue. “To say that it’s a design flaw is a bit of exaggeration,” said V N Singh.
 
 The rotary is designed to cater to traffic coming from three directions—Rajnagar Extension road, Karhera Road and the road leading to G T Road. As per traffic flow chart which was initially conceived, vehicles coming from Rajnagar Extension and Karhera would proceed in clockwise direction around rotary before heading to elevated road.
 
 “But now the elevated road-bound traffic from Rajnagar Extension and Karhera will have to go farther 150 metres on the road leading to GT Road and then make a U-turn before making an entry on elevated road,” said VN Singh. “We hope to finish the work in another couple of days since the inauguration date of elevated road could be announced any time,” said Singh.
 
 The three-lane rotary is elliptical in shape is spread in 13,000 sq m which includes the garden and landscaping area.
