Mumbai: A controversy has erupted over the state government’s decision to fill 36,000   this year and 72,000 over the next two years.

 A government resolution issued by the general administration department mentioned that for the first five years, selected candidates be given an honorarium on the lines of gram sevak or agriculture sevak. This clause has irked the employees’ union which stated that the GR itself is wrong and by adding this clause, the government has made its intention to hire on temporary basis clear. “The state is trying to cheat the educated youth who saw this announcement as their chance for getting permanent jobs with the government,” said Avinash Daund, secretary of the   employees’ union. 
 
 The state government has rebuked the union’s stand and maintained that these posts will be filled permanently. tnn
