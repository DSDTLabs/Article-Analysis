PATNA: Actions initiated by central agencies against RJD chief   and his family apart, the Bihar government is also contemplating action against their Delite Mall for violation of the state’s building bylaws.

 The mall, being developed on a plot allegedly transferred to Lalu as graft, was the immediate cause of split in the Grand Alliance with CM Nitish Kumar parting ways with Lalu.
 
 Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said on Tuesday the state agencies have detected violation of several state laws. The Danapur Municipal Council recently issued a notice, stating that many required documents were missing in the application submitted for approval of the map of the 15-storey mall at Saguna Mor.
 
 The deputy CM said the application was first submitted on April 15, eleven days after he at a press conference alleged anomalies in supply of soil excavated from the mall site to the Patna zoo even as the groundwork at the mall site had been going on for over a year.
 
 SuMo said, “Action can be taken under the Bihar Building Bylaws and Bihar Municipal Act, and they may include penalty and demolition of the structure.” 
 
 The mall is planned to come up on a plot owned by Lara Projects Limited Liability Partnership, an alleged shell firm run by the RJD chief's family. According to an FIR filed by CBI, Sujata Hotels’ director Vinay Kochhar allegedly gave the land to Delite Marketing Company Pvt Ltd in return of getting the maintenance tender of railways’ hotels — BNR Ranchi and BNR Puri.
 
 Delite Marketing was renamed as Lara Projects in 2016, which mainly has two shareholders, Rabri Devi (85%) and Tejashwi Yadav (15%). Lara has tied up with RJD MLA Abu Dojana’s firm Meridian Construction for development of the mall.
 
 The mall construction work, however, has been stayed since May 17 following an order from the Union ministry of environment and forest.
