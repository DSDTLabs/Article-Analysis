PANAJI: Former   Jitendra Deshprabhu stirred up further confusion surrounding the selection of the next state   president saying the leader should be from the minority community and from  .

 “The leader of the opposition is from the south, the Congress president is from the south, the   president is from the south and the AICC secretary, too, is from the south. Are we leaving North Goa for the BJP to have a free ride?” Deshprabhu said.
 
 He also seemed irked with Goa desk-in-charge A Chella Kumar consulting MLAs for their choice of party president. “MLAs of the house and party leadership are distinct entities,” he said.
 
 Questioning the performance of Congress MLAs as legislators, Deshprabhu said, “I don’t see many private members bills coming or resolutions being taken up. I don’t see any decision of state-level consequence coming up. There are times when even cut motions have not been put.”
