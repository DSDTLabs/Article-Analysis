PUNE: Jayanarayan  , who stays at Apang Kalyankari Shikshan Sanstha in Wanowrie, secured 70% in science stream in his Class XII results on Wednesday.

 Belonging to an economically weak family of farmers in Bihar, Mahato came to Pune when he was just seven-year-old. He has 41% disability as his left leg is shorter than the right one, making it difficult for him to walk.
 
 “I want to become an engineer, for which I have already taken the Common Entrance Test,” Mahato, who has gone back to his home town, told TOI. He is also the first-generation learner. “I am the only son. My parents aren’t educated, but they wanted me to be study and become something in life. Hence, they sent me to Pune,” he added.
 
 And Mahato is not the only one to overcome his physical disability to excel in the  . Vanshika Joshi, who also suffers from a similar disability, scored 70.77% in the HSC exam. Joshi, a commerce student from Sir Parshurambhau College, said, “I never got my disability in the way to success. I always felt that I would do well in exam and studied right from day one.”
 
 Joshi eventually wishes to complete her masters in commerce and take competitive exams in the banking sector.
