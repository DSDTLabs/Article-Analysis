NEW DELHI: Protesting against “Gau Rakshak Terrorism”, students of   took out an ‘Insaf March’ in the campus. Raising slogans against those who killed a man in Alwar, students alleged that the incident was a ploy to stoke   in the country.

 Calling the lynching of the Alwar dairy farmer, Pehlu Khan, a “shameful" act, students claimed that there is a plan to attack people from a certain community and to install fear in their minds through vigilante activism like   or cow protection.
 
 Questioning why no concrete action has been taken against the perpetrators of the violence, Meeran Haider, MPhil student at Jamia, called it “a controversy to target one section of the community.” 
 
 Many students said that they were fearful of their well-being in this environment.
 
 Imran Chowdhury, who hails from Mewat, where Pehlu Khan was also a resident of, said: “Pehlu was called a cow smuggler but it was proven he was a poor dairy farmer who bought the cow to sell its milk, like other farmers. But he was stopped on the way to his home by vigilante terrorists who killed him.”
 
 The students carried out their march all across the campus, and culminated it by the lighting candles “to show solidarity with the victims of cow protection terrorism.”
 
 55-year old Pehlu Khan and his son were attacked in Alwar after they were returning from a cattle fair after being accused of being a cow smuggler.
