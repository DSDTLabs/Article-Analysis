GAYA: Nepal Prime Minister   has invited chief minister   Kumar to visit Kathmandu to find a permanent solution to the perennial flood problem.
 
  “We look forward to welcoming you in Kathmandu at an early date... Joint efforts are urgently required to find a permanent solution to the flood problem and in the process reap the benefits of irrigation, hydropower and navigation,” Deuba wrote in his letter which was routed through the Nepalese embassy in New Delhi.
  
  The letter also thanks Kumar for excellent hospitality offered to the Nepal PM during his recent visit to Bodh Gaya. The Nepal PM had led a 43-member delegation to visit   last month. In his letter, Deuba said offering prayer in the Buddha shrine gave him ‘distinct pleasure’.
  
  Praising Nitish for his leadership qualities, the Nepal PM, in the letter, said, “I am happy to note that   has achieved remarkable progress under your dynamic and visionary leadership. We believe that Nepal can benefit from unprecedented economic transformation taking place in India.”
  
  Describing Bihar as a state with which Nepal shares “history, extensive familial ties, common culture, civilisational values and commercial cooperation”, the PM proposed a Buddhist Circuit by linking Buddha’s birthplace Lumbini in Nepal with Bodh Gaya to tap into the religious and cultural tourism potential in the two countries.
