KOLKATA:   got a boost ahead of their   second-leg clash of   preliminary round against   when their two Nigerian players -defender   and striker   -got their visas late on Monday. 

 The duo, along with   midfielder  , reached Kolkata on Tuesday morning and were also included in the starting XI. 
 
 However, in the final analysis, it hardly made much difference as the green and maroons registered a 2-1 victory at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium to move into the playoff stage, winning 4-2 on aggregate. Bagan will now face Club Valencia of Maldives over two legs -February 21away and February 28 home -for a place in the group stage.
 
 The hosts could have won by an even bigger margin had substitute Balwant Singh not missed a penalty in the 78th minute. 
 
 Seka Jean Yapo reduced the margin for the visitors with a fine solo effort in the 88th minute. Apart from the victory , what was more pleasing from Bagan's point of view was the fine show by Sony Norde before the I-League's Kolkata Derby against East Bengal on Sunday . 
 
 Sony, who missed Bagan's last couple of matches due to an injury , made a fine return to action by scoring the opening goal and turned provider for Darryl Duffy after the change of ends. He looked in fine touch for the 62 minutes he was on the field and gave a tough time for Colombo FC right-back Charitha Rathnayake.
