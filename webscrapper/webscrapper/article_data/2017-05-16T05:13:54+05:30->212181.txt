NEW DELHI: Two trucks caught fire in   at 11 am on Monday. Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot and the fire was doused by 1 pm.

 Three trucks were standing next to bundles of hay. According to fire officials, someone threw a   butt in the area, which set the hay ablaze. The fire escalated quickly and the trucks caught fire as well. While two of the trucks were completely burnt, workers responded quickly and shifted the third   so that it could be saved.
 
 H S  , whose son made the call for the fire tenders and works in the same business, added, “There was a fire a couple of days ago at night as well. But the workers managed to control it.”
 
 According to the transportation workers, the cigarette butts on both occasions were thrown by the workers in the Mandi who have been living in the area illegally. “They have been here for the last 30-35 years. We have complained to DDA multiple times,” said Garewal.
