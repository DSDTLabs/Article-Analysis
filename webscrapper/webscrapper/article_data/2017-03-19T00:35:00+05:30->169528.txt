Jaipur: A day after the Jaipur police arrested 18 bookies from a hotel for their alleged involvement in a   racket, the cops suspect that meeting was planned a few moments after the election results were declared.

 On Thursday, several local papers in Indore had reported that bookies are set to meet at Jaipur’s leading hotel to chalk out problems related to the payments of betting bids. 
 
 “The bookies were hoping to make a fortune this elections season but jolt came as the BJP’s tally began to rise. On the counting day itself, several bookies started getting calls from the people to pay up their money which they had won. The bookies contacted their kingpins who refused to pay up the money citing several reason,” an official said, adding that some kingpins told their bookies that election were rigged due to tampering with EVM machines and declined to offer the money.
 
 The panicking bookies then called each other and asked their masters to pay up the promised money as soon as possible. “There has been a sense of confusion among the bookies ever since the UP election results were declared. The bets placed on the elections have been to the tune of over Rs 500 crore, therefore, the dealers are panicking,” cops said adding that many of the arrested bookies said they received threat calls from the people, asking them to pay back their amount.
 
 The city police are now questioning the accused and try to get more details on the modus operandi of the racket. The cops however said they are examining the CCTV footage of the hotel to zero in on the other suspects.
