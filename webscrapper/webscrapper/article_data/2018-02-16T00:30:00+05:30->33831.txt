Bengaluru: A day after TOI reported about a gang promising cure through an oil for various disorders and fleecing gullible people, another victim has lodged a complaint with Indiranagar police station.

 Anant Pashilkar, 76, a former defence employee from Mumbai, who now lives in Bengaluru, said he lost Rs 5.4 lakh to Parampara Ayurvedic Centre on January 21. On Wednesday, TOI wrote about the group’s modus operandi (Gang promises herbal oil cure, takes many for a ride). 
 
 On Thursday, Pashilkar lodged a complaint against the centre. “I was walking near Jeevan Bima Nagar when a young man approached me and said I would be able to walk better if I applied a particular oil. He came to our house and made us get some herbal ingredients and prepared the oil. Next, he took me to the shop in Indiranagar, where I was asked to pay for the bhasma (metal ash) that was added to the oil,” he said. 
 
 Pashilkar and his wife, both of whom have undergone knee-replacement surgery, paid Rs 5.4 lakh through cheque and cash to the self-styled healers.
 
 Tried the trick with many
 
 A chartered accountant from Koramangala said he too was duped by the same gang two years ago. “We were fooled by the gang. But by the time we realised it was a fraud, the store with the same name, which was then in Koramangala, shut dpwm and the men went missing,” he said.
 
 A woman from Amruthahalli said she was bullied into paying Rs 1.9 lakh for the oil by a member from the same gang, but managed to take back the cheque from the crook immediately. 
 
 “My family was cheated of Rs 8 lakh by this gang. We have their contact number and details of the cheque (we gave them),” responded a reader from Jalahalli West on TOI website.
