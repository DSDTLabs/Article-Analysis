NEW  : By next week, six mobile vans will tour the city’s markets and attempt to help traders with issues related to Goods and  . Deputy chief minister   said that in addition to these vans, helpdesks will also be set up at small markets in the city.

 “I visited the facilitation centre on Thursday and realised that many small traders had basic issues with GST. I also saw the   Network website continues to have certain problems and I hope these will be sorted soon,”   said.
 
 Each van will have a GST officer who will help resolve any issue related to the new tax regime.
 
 “The vans are being equipped with a loudspeaker so that they can announce their arrival and point for meeting while driving through the market. They will set up a camp at a central point and assist the traders and move on to the next market,” he added.
 
 The government will also tie-up with market associations so that they can be informed of the date and time of the visit, he said.
 
 Sisodia, who has maintained that the GST is a good concept but has not been implemented properly in India, said that it could lead to tax evasion at one level and harassment of traders at another. 
 
 “It is too early to ascertain its impact on business but traders are facing problems. Many of them have not been able to incorporate the new system within their existing billing. We will review the situation in some time,” said an official.
