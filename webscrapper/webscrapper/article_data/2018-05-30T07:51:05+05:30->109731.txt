BENGALURU: Having made furniture and other equipment for montessori classes held by schools for over two decades, he had never imagined that his daughters would not only study in an upscale private English-medium school but one of them would also scale academic heights.

 
 Today, S   is a proud man, with his daughter, Akshaya Abirami, scoring 60% in CBSE Class 10 exams. She’s a student of Geethanjali Vidyalaya, Thippasandra.
 
 
 “I am happy that my children are being educated in a good school, something I didn’t experience. When Akshaya was five or six years old, I asked principal Nagaratna Murthy which government school I should enrol her in. That’s when she opened the school’s doors to my daughters, saying she wouldn’t accept a penny to educate them. All the expenses, including the cost of books and uniform, were borne by the school authorities. My second daughter too is studying in the same school,” Sadhacharan said.
 
 “I felt sympathetic towards Sadhacharan when he was looking a government school for his daughters.The man whobuilt furniture and other equipment for our school and many other institutions was helpless,” recalled Nagaratna.
 
 Akshaya will pursue commerce from the same institution and wants to become a banker.
