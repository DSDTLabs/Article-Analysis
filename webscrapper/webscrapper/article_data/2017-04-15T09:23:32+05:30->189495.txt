RAJKOT: With the mercury touching 45 degrees, not only humans but behavioural changes is seen in the wild animals too. Extreme weather and lack of easy prey bring the wild animals, especially predators close to human habitat leading to increase in man-animal conflicts.

 The forest department has issued directions to keep a close watch on the movement of lions in their respective areas, especially those outside the protected forest. “Search for   and prey would bring the lion and leopard close to human habitat. This would definitely lead to more man animal conflict,” said HS Singh an expert and a member of the   for Wildlife. 
 
 During 1950–1984, few lions, less than a half dozen, were sighted from Girnar and Mitiyala, outside the Gir forest. But the actual lion dispersion started during severe drought in 1987–88 when the big cats moved out in search of water, he said. 
 
 Singh further said that usually when the temperature rises such conflicts are bound to increase as the big cats would venture out in areas where there is water.
 
 AP Singh, the chief conservator of forest, Junagadh said, “Realizing that the rise in temperature would increase man animal conflicts, I have instructed all the range forest officials, the divisional forest officials to keep a close watch on the movement of the lions and even ensure that the water was regularly filled up in the artificial ponds in the forests. The department has recently procured eight more water tankers to ensure that no pond remains dry.”
 
 Officials in the forest department said they supply on an average 300 water tankers everyday to forest areas in Junagadh, Bhavnagar and Amreli districts. Some artificial ponds are supplied water by nearby villagers.
 
 The officials pointed out that more worrying was that presence of lions in the revenue area where there is lack of such artificial water ponds. It is in these areas that the lion and leopard will be going close to the human habitat.
