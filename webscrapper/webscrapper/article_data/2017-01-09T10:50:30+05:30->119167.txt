MUNGER: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for renovation and beautification of seven   within the jurisdiction of   (MMC).

  Dr Shyamal Kishore Pathak said the renovation work will be done by the National Building Construction Corporation under the Centre’s ‘Namami Gange’ project. He said in the first phase, three ghats – Kastaharni Ghat, Babua Ghat and Sojhi Ghat – will be renovated. The length and breadth of the ghats will be extended to accommodate more people who gather at the ghats to take bath, particularly in summer season and on the occasion of Chhath. 
 
 Sources said other ghats on the banks of the Ganga in Munger, such as Lal Darwaza Ghat and Kankar Ghat, will be renovated in the second phase. The Kastaharni Ghat and Babua Ghat were constructed by former ‘zamindars’ during British rule for which they were honoured with titles of Rai Bahadur and Raja. Since then, the ghats have not undergone any renovation.
 
 Pathak said funds the initial phase has already been handed over to the work agency.
