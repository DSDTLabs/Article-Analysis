PANAJI: Calling Prime Minister   a megalomaniac,   general secretary   said that Modi’s promise to make Goa “comfortable” was a plea to ensure that the BJP government was spared the blushes on the national level. 
 
 “Narendra   is a megalomaniac and he is more worried about his comfort than anyone else's. What he means is comfortable for him. If he loses in Goa, then his own chair will be in danger. So he is looking for comfort for himself and not for Goa,” Singh said while speaking to TOI in the state capital.
 
 Modi on Saturday promised to make Goa India's most "comfortable" state, if   voters give the BJP a majority in the upcoming assembly polls.
 
 “When he talks about a comfortable majority, then is that democracy for the comfort of the people or comfort of the leaders?” Singh said.
