MARGAO: Despite the high court of Bombay at Goa setting a January 15 deadline for occupants of the old “unsafe” municipal building at   to vacate the premises, the process of shifting them to a temporary rehabilitation site is yet to be completed. 

 Sources in the municipal council said that while several traders have been provided with stalls at the GSUDA market complex at Curchorem, others have been allowed to erect temporary structures behind KTC bus stand. 
 
 “Traders had asked for some more time so as to facilitate shifting of goods. Besides, some of the traders had given us a representation requesting the municipality to give them the   to erect their own structures for temporary rehabilitation. The facility has been granted to them following a resolution taken by the council to that effect,” a senior council official told TOI. 
 
 The   (CCMC) has also written to the electricity department to disconnect the power supply to the shops in the old municipal building. There are altogether 42 occupants of the old building that is slated for demolition to pave way for a new commercial complex to be built by   (GSUDA).
 
 Some of the traders in the old building had challenged the notices before the high court of Bombay at Goa. Disposing their petition, the court had set a deadline of January 15 for the occupants of the old building to vacate the premises. 
 
 While rejecting the rehabilitation plan of the CCMC, the traders had demanded equal space in the proposed new building as they presently occupy in the old one.
 
 Meanwhile, the municipality is in receipt of a proposal from a building demolition agency to execute the demolition of the old building without charging the CCMC any amount.The proposal has been forwarded to GSUDA for approval.
