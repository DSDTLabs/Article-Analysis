MANGALURU: Activists of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) blocked the   highway for more than one hour on Tuesday protesting the alleged negligence of police in providing treatment to a family of four which was injured in a clash at Kasba Bengre village. 

 Due to the protest the traffic had piled up on both sides of the highway and police had to struggle to ensure smooth movement of vehicles.
 
 According to police, two families had been engaged in a land dispute for a long time. On Tuesday, things turned ugly as one family attacked another with lethal weapons at Kasba Bengre. Ahmed, his wife and their two children were badly injured in the clash. Panambur police rushed to the spot and took the family in their vehicle to provide treatment at a nearby private hospital. 
 
 The protesters alleged that instead of taking the family to a hospital for treatment, police abandoned them on the road near Kulur. 
 
 D S Rajendra, ACP, however, refuted the allegation sating that victims on the way to AJ Hospital stopped the vehicle near Kulur and told the police that they would go to   for treatment. They also asked police to go back stating that they would manage on their own. “On the way to Wenlock Hospital, the victims received calls from DYFI activists who forced them to comeback. After the inurred come back to same spot where police had left them, the activists started a protest,” he said adding a probe will be conducted into the issue to know the truth.
