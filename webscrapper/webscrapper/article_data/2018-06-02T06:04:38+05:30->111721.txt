HYDERABAD: The cyber crime sleuths on Friday arrested a   national who illegally entered India by crossing Indo-Nepal border in search of his second wife from Hyderabad. After entering India, the accused settled in Hyderabad by obtaining fake identity documents with the help of local people.

 The accused, Mohammed Usman Ikram alias Mohammed Abbas Ikram, 41, is a native of Chak 5/6, ML Navel, Piplan, Mianwali, Punjab, Pakistan.
 
 About eight years ago, Ikram met a 35-year-old divorcee from Hyderabad during his stay in Dubai and married her by claiming himself to be from Delhi . The woman had children from her previous marriage.
 
 On knowing that Ikram was a Pakistani, she returned to Hyderabad seven years ago.
 
 In 2011, Ikram went to Pakistan and from there reached Nepal by air.
 
 
 
 
 From Nepal, he crossed the border illegally and entered India. Ikram then reached Hyderabad and told his wife that he came to India on a six-month visit visa.
 
 After coming to Hyderabad, Ikram, with the help of three locals, created fake residential documents and education certificates to get a job. Using the fake certificates, Ikram started living in Chaderghat and also joined a private firm.
 
 When he was in Dubai, Ikram recorded obscene videos of his 12-year-old stepdaughter and sold the clippings to some people. He sent the same video to a relative of his wife in Hyderabad and started blackmailing her for money.
 
 Unable to bear the torture of Ikram, his wife lodged a complaint with police on Friday and cops immediately went into action, and arrested him at his house in Chaderghat. Ikram destroyed his Pakistan passport while crossing the Nepal border but police found a photocopy of it with his wife. A man-hunt was launched to nab the locals who helped Ikram obtain fake identity papers and other documents. Two people are reportedly in police custody.
