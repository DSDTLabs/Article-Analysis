NEW DELHI: Two days after deputy chief minister   presented the 'Outcome Report' on the   office highlighting 50% vacancies in key departments, the   on Friday alleged the data paints a "distorted and incorrect" picture about services matters. 

 While presenting the report in the House earlier this week, Sisodia listed department-wise vacancies, saying it is bound to have a "serious impact" on the implementation of the projects and policies of that department.
 
 The services department on Friday issued a press statement claiming the factual position is that between February 2015 and August 2016 , "services", which deals with, among other subjects, filling up of vacancies, was being dealt through the elected government.
 
 However, the high court in its order on August 4, 2016, stamped the primacy of the lieutenant governor in affairs of the government, it said.
 
  "Between February 2015 and August 2016, even though there existed 23,137 vacancies as on February 2015 for filling up under direct recruitment through   ( ) /  , the elected government did not send even a single requisition to DSSSB/ UPSC," the statement said. 
 
  It stated that if these vacancies had been notified to DSSSB/UPSC in time, by now those would have been processed. "It is interesting to note that the outcome report itself states that posts of over 30,000 teachers are lying vacant. The said report fails to state that these posts were also vacant during the period February 2015 to August 2016," the services department said. 
 
 I t also said, "The fact is that it is only now, when 'services' is directly under the LG, nearly a third of these vacancies have been advertised to be filled up through DSSSB and for the remaining vacancies too, expeditious action for release of advertisements and filling up (the posts) is being taken."
