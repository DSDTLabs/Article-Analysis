 This was decided at a recent meeting held by  , commissioner of the   (PCMC). The meeting was also attended by  , deputy commissioner of police (traffic), assistant commissioner of police   and ruling party leader  , among others.
 
 PCMC, along with the traffic police, will hire hydraulic vans to lift vehicles parked in no-parking areas and other roads for a period of three years. The corporation has already invited bids for the purpose.
 
 Fines of Rs 250 and Rs 500 will be slapped on the owners of rule-violating two-wheelers and four-wheelers respectively. Meanwhile, traffic officials have said they would tow-away all vehicles that have been wrongly parked.
 
 “Though Pimpri Chinchwad has big roads, they are getting congested. People should make use of public transport more. Public awareness would be created on this issue,” Eknath Pawar said.
