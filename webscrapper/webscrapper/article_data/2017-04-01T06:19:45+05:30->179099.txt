NEW DELHI: Killed by his younger brother Aurangzeb in the battle of succession, virtues of Mughal emperor Shahjahan’s eldest son,  , have gained relevance in the current saffron dominated political horizon of the country.

 Describing   as a Sufi, who cared for people of all followings, Union power minister   on Friday said Dara’s love for all religions particularly Hinduism and Sikhism was akin to the current government’s slogan of “sabka saath, sabka vikas”. “Dara’s promotion of peace focusing on co-existence of Hinduism and Islam was exemplary.
 
 In fact, today’s slogan of sabka saath, sabka vikas is similar to what Dara Shikoh had envisioned,” said Goyal, while speaking as chief guest during the 9thChaman Lal Memorial Lecture titled: “Syncretism in Hindu Dharma with Special Reference to Dara Shikoh”, on Friday. A full time RSS pracharak, Chaman Lal, had passed away in 2003 and the lecture was organised in his memory.
 
 On Thursday, top RSS functionaries, including RSS Sah-Karyawah, Dattatray Hosabole and prachar pramukh, Manmohan Vaidya, were in the audience, showing the importance the Sangh attaches to Shikoh’s legacy.
 
 Goyal took the occasion to lambast critics of the RSS and its tributaries saying that a few vested interests have tried to paint a wrong picture about the Sangh. “The growing popularity of RSS has ultimately silenced those having little or misinformation about the organisation.”
