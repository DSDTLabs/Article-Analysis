VADODARA: Employee of a Gujarati news daily was booked for cheating the company to the tune of Rs 1.72 lakh by   police on Tuesday. 

 The accused Ajay  , who worked in the circulation department, allegedly manipulated the accounts for the months of September, October and November last year and used the money for his personal use.
 
 Accounts manager of the company stated in his complaint that Parmar was made in-charge of   distribution centre in September 2016 making him responsible for all transactions. 
 
 He told the police that when he was checking the books of accounts of Raopura centre, he found that there was a miscalculation amounting to Rs 1.72 lakh.
 
 When Parmar was confronted by the complainant and his department head, he admitted that he had used the money for his personal use. But, on December 1 Parmar gave a cheque of the same amount which was returned by the bank as Parmar did not have enough balance in his account.
 
 Parmar promised the department that will pay the entire amount by January 15 which he did not.
