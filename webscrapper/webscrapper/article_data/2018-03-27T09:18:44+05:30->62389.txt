BHOPAL: In a major move that would provide relief to lakhs of families, state government is all set to regularize over 5,000   in  .

 On Monday addressing a workshop related to regularization of illegal colonies at  , CM   directed officials to complete the process by August 15.
 
 Ahead of the state assembly polls, the process would commence from April 7. “Any delay in execution of the scheme would not be tolerated. People living in these colonies are living without basic civic amenities,” said Chouhan.
 
  
 “Rules, regulations and law are all only valid if they are for public welfare,” he added.
 
 An amendment in Madhya Pradesh Coloniser Rules 1998 would place these colonies on a fast track to regularisation. Development fee and other penalties on residents have also been reduced. In another significant change, an ‘illegal’ colony would be deemed legal without attaining building permission completion certificate, as required till now. 
 
 Urban development department will legalise the colonies by charging 20% development charges for repairing sewage line and road and water supply. Urban development department will contribute about 80% of the share. Basic civic services like water, sanitation, electricity, will be streamlined and funds like development fee collected from the colony would be utilized for its own development.
 
 In the first phase, around 500 illegal colonies will be legalized. Main object behind the move is to provide for better residential colonies and improve livability, said urban development minister, Maya Singh.
