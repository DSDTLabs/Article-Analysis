People, especially those who are conscious about the environment, seem to have developed a dislike for flower bouquets due to the amount of flowers plucked and the resulting wastage.

Want to take it up a notch? Bake the cupcakes yourself. Just make sure they are edible. Take her sister along and buy her favourite makeup products. Then, style them into a bouquet and present it to her. We can bet she won’t be able to say no to this. Imagine a bouquet full of cuddly soft toys that will last a lifetime.
