BENGALURU: An upgraded version of   cruise missile, with an extended range will be tested on March 10 by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).   Chief S Christopher said that the extended range version of the missile, aiming to reach 450 km, will be an improvement over the current range of 290 km. 

 India has ballistic missiles capable of hitting target threat from its neighbours, however, range extension of BrahMos becomes advantageous for armed forces because of its precision. 
 
 The technology upgrade comes after India’s full membership into the   (MTCR), which removed caps on range of India’s  , which it jointly developed with Russia. 
 
 Christopher said for testing purposes a missile has been taken from the Indian Army. He said although DRDO was ready with technology for extending range to 450km, the MTCR restrictions didn't allow testing. 
 
 Now with the restrictions off, a second variant of the missile, which can go up to distances of 800-850 km will be produced in 2.5 years' time. 
 
 The DRDO chief also said that work has started on a new version of the Akash anti-air missile and talks are on for a possible export order from Vietnam. He also added that there are export opportunities for BrahMos and Helina anti-tank guided missiles. 
 
 It was also mentioned that a delegation from Bahrain met DRDO officials about the Light Combat Aircraft during the Aero India.
