SHIMLA:   ( ) has given   government a last opportunity to file report on carrying capacity of the hills in Shimla by May 4 The government has failed to submit it even after repeated orders from the tribunal bench although an expert committee to study the ecology had been constituted way back in 2015.

 NGT in 2015 had directed the state to study and submit a report relating to Shimla’s carrying capacity, impact of further density on sewage system, water supply collection and disposal of municipal solid waste, transportation, status of the environment and ecology.
 
 During the hearing held on April 27, counsel representing the state government informed NGT that the report is being prepared and it would positively be filed within a week. On this, the NGT bench headed by Justice Swatanter Kumar agreed to grant them the one week’s time. The matter would now be heard on May 5.
 
 Shimla, being one of the popular tourist spots, has always experienced high footfalls of people from all over India and abroad. High level of construction works and destruction of forests have now added to the tourist pressure to raise concerns about maintaining the area’s ecological balance. 
 
 Applicant   had approached NGT in 2014 to challenge the notification issued by the state government on December 7, 2000 declaring some areas as green belt. Vide order dated May 30, 2014, tribunal had passed an order of restraint against the  , state of Himachal Pradesh and other authorities from raising any construction or permitting any construction in the areas specified in the notification dated December 7, 2000 that is relating to declaration of forest area.
