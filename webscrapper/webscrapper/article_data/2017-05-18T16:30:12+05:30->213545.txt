PATNA:   has outrightly denied   on Tuesday on the premises in Delhi-NCR in connection with alleged benami land deals linked to his family.

 “I want to know which are these 22 places which were raided. These are in fact rumours circulated by the BJP,” Lalu told a section of the media at his 10, Circular Road residence on Wednesday morning. 
 
 Speaking on the allegations of benami assets procured through shell companies floated by RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP and former corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta, Lalu said, “Gupta will not give me even one dhur (a small plot) of land for free. These allegations are bunkum.”
 
 Asked about upcoming presidential election, Lalu said he was in talks with like-minded opposition parties to evolve a consensus on a common presidential candidate. “Efforts are on to strengthen the opposition against the BJP and PM Narendra Modi as they are ruining the country in pursuit of their religious and fascist agenda,” he said.
 
 Day after the raids, Lalu appeared unfazed. Even as he took questions from the mediapersons, he kept talking to one of his granddaughters over video call through a smartphone, in between.
 
 Earlier, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee informed Lalu through a tweet on Tuesday that she had accepted his invite to attend the RJD’s ‘BJP hatao-desh bachao’ rally in Patna on August 27. 
 
 ”Senior leaders of most of the opposition parties have agreed to participate in the rally,” Lalu said on Wednesday. 
 
 RJD sources claimed Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala and former PM H D Deve Gowda would be among those who were likely to address the Patna rally.
