AHMEDABAD: A consumer   here has tossed out the argument of insurance companies that all types of   on women to reduce breast size is invariably cosmetic. Holding as much, the court ordered insurers to pay Rs 1.69 lakh to a 55-year-old woman who underwent surgery for reduction last May after years of suffering back and shoulder pain on account of her large breasts.

 The woman had incurred medical expenses amounting to Rs1.64 lakh, but the the court ordered an additional payment of Rs 5,000 towards her mental harassment and legal costs.
 
 The court said the woman, a housewife, was not likely to undergo such surgery for enhancement of beauty, ruling that the procedure was not cosmetic in this case. The court accepted the woman’s diagnosis, and the discharge summary submitted by the petitioner that revealed that following constant pain, reduction   was advised. While the insurers cited a clause in the policy that exempts “circumcision, cosmetic aesthetic treatment, and plastic surgery unless required to treat any injury or illness” from insurance payouts, the court held that in the instant case, the insurers had misinterpreted the clause and engaged in unfair trade practice.
