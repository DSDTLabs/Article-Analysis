BENGALURU: The   high court on Friday issued notice to the state government, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and complainant A Anand in response to two petitions, one filed by former deputy chief minister and senior   leader R Ashoka, in relation to the bagar-hukum land case. Justice R B   also ordered notice to Karnataka Lokayukta, while adjourning the hearing to Tuesday.

 While Ashoka is the accused No. 1, B Karthik, a resident of  , the other petitioner in the case, is accused No. 10. Senior advocate B V Acharya, who appeared on behalf of Ashoka, argued that the case was registered for political reasons. He claimed there has been an inordinate delay in filing the complaint and also contended that there is already a Lokayukta investigation on the same issue which is ongoing.
 
 Ashoka is accused of granting land to ineligible beneficiaries including himself while he served as chairman of the Bengaluru South Taluk Bagar-Hukum Land Regularization Committee between 1998-2006. The case was registered by the ACB earlier this month.
 
 Acharya said there were other members on the committee, but they havenâ€™t been made parties to the case since they were members of Congress party. He claimed the committee was a recommendatory body and that only the revenue authorities, headed by the deputy commissioner, had the power to cancel any such grant if there were any irregularities.
 
 Senior advocate C V Nagesh, appearing on behalf of Karthik, claimed the petitioner belonged to a weaker section of society and the allotment of four acres in   had been ultimately upheld by the high court. There is no case against him, he said.
