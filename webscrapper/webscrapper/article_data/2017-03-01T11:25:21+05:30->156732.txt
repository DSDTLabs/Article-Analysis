It took investigators from the   6 hours to put a number to what they had seen inside the  . There were 7,000 saris in all manner of design and material, clearly worth crores of rupees. And these were only some of the items found during a raid on Tuesday at the house of the  ,  , in  .

 According to sources, the entire room was full of saris, which were reportedly being used by the wife of the official, Kariayappa N. When they asked her about it, she claimed she was running a business but then, on further questioning, couldn’t substantiate the claim with evidence.
 
 “It took almost 6 hours to see and count every sari in the house. The wife of an official from the commercial taxes department having so many expensive saris is hard to believe. It is possible that he may have raided sari shops and kept the clothes,” an ACB officer said.
 
 While the saris alone would collectively be worth a few crores, investigators also found several documents for properties owned by him, his wife and relatives, including three houses, a flat in Bengaluru, agricultural land, and plots. They also found jewellery, shoes, watches and accessories. The couple’s two children are studying abroad.
 
 
 
 
 
 The house of KT Nagaraj, a Chief Engineer with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) -- who is also in charge of TenderSURE works across Bengaluru -- was raided by the ACB investigators on Tuesday morning.
 
 Investigators found several kilograms of gold jewellery in addition to property papers under names of various family members at his house in Jayanagar, 3rd Block.
 
 A senior ACB official said they found that he had bought 150 acres of coffee estate in Sakleshpur and Hassan districts in his own name as well as his wife’s and relative’s.
 
 “We also found more than 10 kg of gold, Rs 7 lakh cash in new currency, five high-end cars, property documents for four plots in Bengaluru, two houses and one commercial complex. Two more lockers are yet to be checked. He has been buying the estate for the last five years and the most recent purchase has been done last year. Nagaraj was heading major roads at BBMP as chief engineer and was then transferred to head of all projects. He was heading the whole TenderSURE project across Bengaluru,” the officer said.
 
 PD Kumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), was also raided by the ACB, which found properties worth crores of rupees, and Rs 2 lakh cash. They found that he had two houses, six sites in Bengaluru and Davanagere, commercial complex at JP Nagar, and agricultural land of around 10 acres at Harapanahalli.
 
 The raids were also conducted on five other government officials from various departments: Saleem Sabusab, deputy tahasildar, Belagavi; PD Kumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, BDA; Karunakar, RTO Senior Inspector from Shivamogga; Jagannath from Bidar Taluk Panchayat; and A Shivakumar, a PDO from Gadag.
