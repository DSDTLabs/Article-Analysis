PUNE: The Bombay high court has rejected the bail application of Rajendra Kamble, who has been detained along with 11 others under   of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), following the murder of a social worker in Hadapsar in September 2014.

 “Bail is discretionary power of the judge,” a single-judge bench of Justice   said in an order on January 24 and observed that irrespective of application of MCOCA, the case involving Kamble was distinguishable considering the motive and the manner in which the deceased was killed and the evidence against the applicant/accused.
 
 Sachin Shelar, who owned a travel firm and was a popular social worker, was attacked and killed out of personal animosity by 12 armed assailants on Kaleboarate Road while he was returning home with his friend,  , on September 27, 2014.
 
 Kadam lodged an FIR in connection with the attack and 12 people, including Kamble, were arrested later. In the charge sheet filed with the court, the police charged the accused under relevant sections of IPC and MCOCA.
 
 Kamble moved a bail application on the ground that one of the co-accused, Anil Mane, was granted bail by the high court on December 23, 2016 and that, he did not participate in the assault. His lawyer argued on the point of application of MCOCA that Kamble was never associated with an organized crime syndicate. The lawyer went on to cite three high court rulings.
 
 The bench, however, observed that complainant Kadam, who is an eyewitness, has identified Kamble besides, another witness has recorded a statement narrating the specific role played by the applicant/accused in the attack on Shelar who died of 36 stab injuries. The bench said that the three cited HC rulings were of no help for the applicant/accused as they were distinguishable from the present case.
