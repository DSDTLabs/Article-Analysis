BHOPAL:  , popularly known as waterman of India for his social work in the field of water conservation, said when   is reeling under drought, chief minister's announcement earlier this year regarding conservation of water bodies was not implemented. 

 Addressing a press conference, Singh said he wrote three letters to the CM and two days back talked to one of his principal secretaries over the issue of drought, but there was no response. 
 
 "We had warned the CM beforehand, but the government did not act," he said at the presser releasing a report on drought in the region. 
 
 He said chief minister   had announced identification and demarcation of all water bodies of Bundelkhand, especially lakes constructed during   era for conservation and repair work .
 
 This work should have started before onset of monsoon, but the government seems to have forgotten its promises, he rued.
 
 A report compiled by Singh after a survey carried in six districts of Bundelkhand - Sagar, Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh, Panna, Damoh and Datia showed there was 73% to 82% crop loss in kharif season. "Consequently, almost 40 % population in these districts is facing food crisis," he said. Singh reiterated a large number of people migrated from Bundelkhand. Only elderly persons and cattle were left behind. Most importantly, he said, they are reluctant to return after successive droughts and joblessness.
