BENGALURU: Union minister of statistics and programme implementation D V Sadananda Gowda feels there should be a three-language policy, while Bengaluru development minister   says Hindi shouldn't be used in   at all. 

 A meeting attended by Gowda, George, MP PC Mohan and government representatives on Thursday failed to reach a consensus on the issue - whether Hindi should be used or removed from Metro station signages.
 
  Gowda termed the social buzz #NammaMetroHindiBeda 'media-created confusion and hype'. "As a central minister I am saying we should adopt a three-language system. Priority should be given to Kannada, and Hindi is spoken in many states. English should also be used because it is an international language and Bengaluru is one of the greatest IT cities; we have many people from all over the world who can understand English," he said. 
 
  After Gowda left the meeting, George said, "My stand on the issue is the same as that of our chief minister." Siddaramaiah recently said Hindi should be removed from Namma Metro station boards/signages; only Kannada and English should be used. 
 
  ( ), meanwhile, beefed up security in some more stations, including MG Road, deploying one KSRP platoon at each. But MD Pradeep Singh Kharola refused to comment on why security is more in some stations and whether the corporation would remove Hindi from the signboards.
 
 On Sunday, Hindi names of a couple of stations - at   and Chickpet - were masked and BMRC failed to categorically say who had done that. 
 
 P C Mohan said the choice is with the state on whether to use Hindi or not. "The Centre and state have equal share in the SPV (special purpose vehicle) and the Centre has put forth a condition to use Hindi as a language in stations and announcements, but if the state does not want to heed that, the choice will be respected by the Centre."
