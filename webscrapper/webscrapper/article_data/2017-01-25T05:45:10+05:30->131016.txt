LUDHIANA: It is perhaps the first time in   that a political party has tried to woo the electorate by promising to   abroad help its citizens migrate there. This promise in Shiromani Akali Dal's (SAD) manifesto -- clearly aimed at Punjabis' craze of going abroad -- released by SAD chief   at Ludhiana on Tuesday has invited criticism from the opposition parties. 

  According to the manifesto, if SAD forms a government in Punjab, it will buy 1 lakh acres of land in US, Canada and other countries and allot this to state's farmers for running professional farmer settlements. Under this initiative, the government will help farmers and state's citizens secure permanent resident status in those countries. However, Sukhbir skipped speaking about this and several other important poll promises during the launch.
 
 Speaking to TOI,  , Congress general secretary said, "This is a laughable promise made by the Badals, but it is very utopian and unfortunate as well. They have insulted Punjabis and the waters of the state as well by making such an announcement, Punjabis will give them a befitting reply on February 4."
