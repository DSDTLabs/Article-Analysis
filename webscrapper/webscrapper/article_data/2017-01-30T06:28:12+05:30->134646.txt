HYDERABAD: Autorickshaw unions in the city have threatened to go on an indefinite strike, a day before the traffic police is set to launch a special drive to crack down on motorists without valid licence. Union leaders allege the drive is being conducted to fill government coffers and will lead to harassment of poor auto drivers.

 “Traffic cops know that a large number of auto drivers do not have licence. Many have not renewed fitness certificates in the last two years. Recently, the government announced Rs 50 per day penalty for lack of fitness certificates. This means that a fine of Rs 18,250 per annum or Rs 36,500 for two years will have to be paid before we can apply for a new fitness certificate.How do cops expect poor auto drivers to pay such huge amounts?" asked A Sathi Reddy, president, Telangana Auto Drivers' Welfare Samakhya.
 
 lack of licences, Reddy said, is due to the rule that a transport licence is given only to those who have passed class 8. Many auto drivers in the city are poor migrants who were forced to drop out of schools early, leaving them at the mercy of the traffic police. “Why don't cops go after private buses that operate as stage carriers in violation of rules?“ asked B Venkatesham, general, secretary ,  .
 
 The drive is unlikely to have a huge impact on cab dri vers. President of Cab Drivers' Association,  , said a majority of drivers are attached with Ola and Uber.“We have no problem as long as police confine the drive to checking documents like licence, insurance and PUC. But it should not turn into harassment to fill coffers," he said.
