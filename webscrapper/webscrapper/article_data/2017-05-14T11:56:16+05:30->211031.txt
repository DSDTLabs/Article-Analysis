LUCKNOW: Alliance partner of the BJP-led NDA government Apna Dal (Sonelal) has sought allotment of office chambers occupied by Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal at the   secretariat. Apna Dal (S) has staked claim for the chambers as it is the fourth largest party in the state with nine MLAs in UP assembly and has also sought allotment of a party office.

 The party has requested Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit to give them the chamber occupied by  , which is reduced from eight MLAs to one, said Ashish Kumar Singh, husband of Union Minister Anupriya Patel.
 
 Before the assembly elections, Anupriya Patel-led section had got a separate party registered as Apna Dal (Sonelal) after she was expelled from the party by her mother Apna Dal president Krishna Patel.
 
 The decision to form a separate party by Anupriya group became a necessity after the Mirzapur MP got into a dispute over right to the original party with her mother Krishna and sister Pallavi Patel. After forming a separate party, Anupriya Patel-led Apna Dal (S) joined hands with the BJP and contested on 12 seats as NDA alliance partner. The Apna Dal (S) won nine seats in the recently concluded vidhan sabha.
 
 “We have nine MLAs and need a chamber in Vidhan Bhawan,” said Ashish, adding that a letter from the party was given to the Speaker.
 
 On the other hand, no specific location has been sought for a party office outside the Vidhan Bhawan, said Ashish, adding that an office in Lucknow was a necessity as party workers find no place to assemble. The letter for a party office has been sent to chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi, an Apna Dal member told TOI. RLD has a party office adjacent to the state BJP headquarters with former MP Lalji Tandon's official residence separating the two.
 
 Urban development minister Suresh Khanna said though he was no more looking into allotments of chambers, he did confirm that Anupriya Patel had given him her requirement.
