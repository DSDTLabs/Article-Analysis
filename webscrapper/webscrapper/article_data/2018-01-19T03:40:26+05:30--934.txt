NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked   and three   to take one more shot at resolving the issues relating to shifting of the flights of IndiGo, Spicejet and GoAir from Terminal 1 (T1) to T2 of IGI.

 A bench of Justices   and Rekha Palli said it deemed it appropriate “to give one last opportunity” to the parties to settle the issues else on Friday it will hear on merits the appeal filed by  , which operates IndiGo.
 
  added that it is troubled by the inconvenience that would be caused to the public and wants both parties to take one more chance to resolve the problems.
 
 Meanwhile, aviation regulator directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) informed HC that IndiGo flew 12.7 million passengers between April 1 and December 31, 2017. In the same period, Spicejet and GoAir’s traffic load was 3.7 million and over 2 million, respectively. This was in response to HC’s direction earlier this week to provide details of the number of passengers who flew on these airlines to and from Delhi during this period.
 
 The direction came during the hearing of an appeal by IndiGo against a single judge’s order on December 20 last year which upheld DIAL’s decision of partially shifting the airlines’ operations from T1 to T2. The judge had given the airlines time till February 15 to partially   their operations.
 
 The airline had argued that the decision would cause “complete confusion and inconvenience” to passengers and virtually have the effect of destroying its business. DIAL had rubbished IndiGo’s claims and said there was no error in the single judge’s order.
 
 On October 21, 2017, DIAL had asked the three airlines to shift their flights operating between Delhi and Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru to T2 from January 4. All other flights could continue to operate from T1.
