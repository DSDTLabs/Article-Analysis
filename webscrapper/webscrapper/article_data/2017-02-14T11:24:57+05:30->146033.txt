VADODARA: Gujarat high court on Monday upheld MS University’s decision of granting permission to   to continue as a university employee even after he was elected Vadodara mayor after contesting civic body polls in 2015.

 During July 2015 syndicate meeting MSU’s syndicate members had decided to introduce a condition for giving NOCs to all the employees who had sought permission to contest the   (VMC) elections. 
 
 The members had decided that if any university employee wins the polls, he or she will have to make a choice between their job at   or a career as a politician.
 
 Dangar had won the polls uncontested from ward number 12 after his rival candidate withdrew from the poll fray. 
 
 Later in December 2015, the university had received a request from Dangar, who wanted the university to waive the condition and allow him to continue as assistant professor of Department of Electrical Engineering at Faculty of Technology and Engineering. The syndicate members had granted the permission to Dangar to continue as a university employee.
 
 This decision of the university’s syndicate body was challenged by another teacher from technology faculty Nikul Patel, who recently got elected as a senate member, on the grounds that even he would have contested the civic body polls if the condition was waived off. Although Patel had received conditional permission to contest, he did not contest in the VMC polls held two years ago. 
 
 “The high court has disposed the plea,” said MSU’s assistant registrar (ADM) Mayank Vyas.
