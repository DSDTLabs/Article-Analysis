Nagpur: The Nagpur division of Central Railway has recorded all-time high earnings by achieving Rs2,849 crore.

 “This is a whopping Rs500 crore more than the set target of Rs2,351 crore. It is the best ever earning performance of any financial year,” said divisional railway manager (DRM) Brijesh Kumar Gupta.
 
 According to senior divisional commercial manager (SrDCM) KK Mishra, Nagpur has come out with flying colours in revenue earnings across the Indian Railways.
 
 “During fiscal 2017-18 that ended on March 31, revenue from coal transportation was Rs2,383 crore by loading 7,764 rakes. This is 50% more over the last year’s earnings of Rs1,593 crore with 5,961 rakes,” said Gupta.
 
 “We had actually crossed the revenue target in February itself when the earnings in a single month were Rs294 crore. We planned to achieve Rs300 crore mark in March by naming it Mission 300 Crores,” says Mishra.
 
 DRM Gupta says, “When industry is reeling under slump, we could cross the mark due to meticulous planning the number of rakes on day-to-day basis. Besides timely placement, loading and unloading with faster movement delivered the results.”
 
 After coal, Mishra says revenue from cement was over Rs152 crore by loading 525 rakes. Earnings in cement also increased by 22% over the last financial year’s Rs125 crore with 404 rakes.
 
 The Central Railway substantially increased its revenue by transporting steel, iron slag, clinker, de-oiled cakes (DOC), foodgrains etc. Mishra says there was increase of 84% in transportation of iron slag. “We earned Rs28.76 crore this year as compared to Rs15.63 crore last year,” he added.
