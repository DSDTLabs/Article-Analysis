Since its launch in July 2014, Zee TV’s popular primetime drama   took the nation by storm with its clutter-breaking concept of a Jamai Sid Khurana (played by  ) on a mission to fix the estranged relationship between his wife Roshni (played by  ) and mother-in-law Durga Devi aka DD, a fiercely independent, tough-as-nails, businesswoman (played by  ).
 
  The show firmly fixed the spotlight on its male protagonist in an otherwise female-oriented domain and in a short span of time, Sid Khurana emerged as the ideal son-in-law that every girl’s mother wanted to have.
  
  
 
  
  The show with an intriguing plot and well-defined characters played convincingly by talented actors like Ravi Dubey, Nia Sharma, Achint Kaur, Mouli Ganguly, Apara Mehta and Shiny Doshi has entertained audiences across its three seasons over 2 years and 6 months and will now end on 3rd March with its 700th episode.
  
  Ravi Dubey's wife   took to Instagram by posting pictures and videos of Sid aka husband Ravi Dubey.
  
  She posted a video with Ravi romancing Nia and captioned it saying "Starting today is the last week of #jamairaja and i personally wanted to give it a beautifull send off. This show converted me from ravi's wife/gf/friend to his ardent and biggest fan.
  I dont think anyone can romance better than you @ravidubey2312 . You can make a stone fall in love with you .everytime i see you romancing on screen i wish i had a husband like siddharth.(ps-i do realise later that i already do)
