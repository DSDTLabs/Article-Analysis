After being in judicial custody for over three weeks at   jail on charges of sexual assault, singer  , was granted a conditional bail on Wednesday. The singer was arrested after a 28-year-old former employee of the online radio station,  , filed an FIR against him for sexual misconduct. 
The bail was accorded by City Civil court, on the condition that Srinivas appears at   police station twice every week, on Mondays and Tuesdays. Sreenivas also had to pay a bail amount of Rs 20,000 and have two guarantors for his release. The other accused,  , an employee of the web radio station, who allegedly forced and pushed the victim to exchange sexual favours was granted 
 unconditional anticipatory bail.
 Srinivas was charged under Sections 354A, 354 and 509, which is for sexual harassment, assault or criminal force and word gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman respectively. He was arrested on January 2. 
 While Srinivas had requested for bail, the police filed a petition against his bail for the purpose of investigation. “We filed a petition to prevent him from interfering with investigations.

We are waiting for the Forensic Lab report to ascertain the authenticity of the photographic and videographic evidences submitted,” said investigating officer, Sub Inspector G Venkateshwarlu.
