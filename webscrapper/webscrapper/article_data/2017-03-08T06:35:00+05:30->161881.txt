NAGPUR: Development and greed will only eat into the peace in our life. Hence, being satisfied is more important than being rich, said  , noted thinker and speaker, here on Sunday.

 Ghalsasi was delivering the   under title ‘Jagnyachi AAS WA Jagnyacha Bhas’ which was held as a part of Shri Ganesh lecture series jointly organized by   and Shri Gajanan Sahakari Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha at Munje Hall, Mahal.
 
 “Even 1,000-year-old seeds and grains have the characteristic to grow but we humans have lost all our virtues due to jealousy, impurity and greed,” Ghalsasi said while discussing the will for living.
 
 “Is a toothpaste needed for our teeth? That is the question which we need to ask ourselves rather than where it is manufactured — India or Western countries?” he said.
 
  “Needs are now created by manufacturers’ supply and not by consumers’ demand. This has given rise to accumulation of unnecessary goods. And it is an illusion when it comes to leading a life,” he said.
 
 Making a remark on the theory of cell by Nobel Prize winner Charles Sherrington, he said, “With the help of spirituality only, we can achieve the purpose of our life like a cell. “Everyone who has been carved out of a cell has some purpose in life. So humans who consist a group of cells should possess some purpose in life too,” said Ghalsasi.
 
 “The way we live has been disturbed by our unstable mind. But nature can helps us in understanding everything. For that one just needs to make an effort to understand nature and act accordingly,” he said.
