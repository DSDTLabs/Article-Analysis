But the opposite community wanted to demolish the temple. It also wanted members of the petitioner’s community to appear at a common place without wearing shirt and bow before it. When this was opposed by the petitioner’s community, the tahsildar and the   orally instructed not to conduct the temple festival for 20 days. 
 
 Hence, it was necessary to issue direction to the authority to permit the petitioner’s community people to conduct the festival. Following this, the bench directed the HR&CE department to take control of the temple and also directed the petitioner to approach the department regarding the festival.
