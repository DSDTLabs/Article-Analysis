RAIPUR:   president   challenged   on the issue of dynasty politics when, in reply to a media query late Sunday evening, he said: “So… Dimple (his wife) will not contest elections. Will BJP do the same in their party?” Yadav said his party was gearing up for the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, scheduled for November 2018.

 “I will visit both states frequently and my party will play a crucial role in the next assembly polls in these states,” the former UP CM said. Taking a dig at PM   on demonetisation and goods and services tax, Yadav said: “Those who are now playing politics of cow, buffalo and cow dung are talking about digital India in the same breath. We are Yeduvanshis and cow is our real mother, but BJP is using the cow for its narrow political gains.”
 
 On reservation, Yadav remarked that everyone should get whatever right the Constitution guarantees. “If you want to please a few by providing reservation, why don’t you mention castes on Aadhar card? We don’t want to displease anyone—neither forward castes nor backward castes,” he said.
 
 Addressing the Yadav Mahasabha meet, he accused the Modi government of using CBI and other central agencies to “target political adversaries and others who were fighting against injustice”.
