PATNA: The tussle between  and state government on   for equal work on the basis of   ruling is far from over even after the Bihar Home Guard Association called off its indefinite strike on April 5 on assurance from governor   Despite withdrawal of agitation, the state government is yet to   to the home guard jawans.
 
  Association’s general secretary Sudheshwar Prasad said an emergency meeting of the central committee will be held here on Monday in which members of the association from all districts of Bihar would take part.
  
  “The meeting is being held as the state government has still not allowed them to join duty even after four days of end of strike. The association members may meet the governor again over the state government’s decision to bar them from re-joining duty,” Prasad said, adding an official letter had been issued by district commandant of home guard on April 6 for not deploying them on duty till further orders.
  
  The jawans have been restrained from joining duty by the state government on ground of indiscipline and also that they had gone on strike from vital installations where they were deployed.
  
  The strike was called off only after Kovind intervened and met association’s five-member delegation, assuring them that he would soon do something on their demand of equal pay for equal work. Earlier, their meeting with the state government failed several times.
  
  Sources said the state government is seeking details of the home guard jawans who were deployed in emergency fire services and guarding currency chests across the state to dismiss them from service.
  
  Home department principal secretary Amir Subhani had also said that government would take action against the home guard jawans on active duty as their strike was against Home Guard Act. He had also said the Supreme Court ruling is only for Punjab and West Bengal as they were the respondents in the case.
