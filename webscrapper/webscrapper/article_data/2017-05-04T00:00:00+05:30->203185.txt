Filmmaker   has lately been sporting a lean, mean avatar, which has had people wondering why. We have the answer. The filmmaker will return to stage with the play  , which will be staged later this month. When quizzed about what made him decide to return to  ,   said, “I was talking to a few friends and they reminded me about how I could do everything by myself onstage back in the day. Filmmaking, which I’ve been busy with lately, is a more collaborative process. Most of the times we might not end up getting the results that we set out to achieve, because there are inputs from many other people. This play, on the other hand, is very me and I thought that I needed to take up this challenge to see if I can still do it. I’ve been busy with the preparations for the play for the last two months.”
Pawan’s physical transformation, he says, was also in a sense motivated because of this. “It is always good to be fit and this play requires a lot of physical activity, so I have been busy working out,” says the filmmaker, who is thrilled to revisit the play after nearly a decade. “I had last seen the script in 2008. I didn’t have a copy of it and had to eventually get it off the person who did the lights for the play. I wrote the play when I was 20, which was in 2002. What is interesting is that the play is relevant even now and I can relate better to it. I will be retaining most of the play, but there will be a five-minute improvization,” adds Pawan.
 Apart from the play, Pawan’s also been doing cameos for a few films. Given that he has acted in films like Inti Ninna Preetiya,   and   before he moved to direction, will this mean that he will do more roles in films? “I don’t enjoy acting in cinema as much as theatre. Cameos are fine, but if something good or interesting comes along, I may end up acting in a film too,” Pawan signs off.
