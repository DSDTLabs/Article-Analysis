Ferozepur: Mortal remains of Jatinder Singh of Kacharbhan village in Zira subdivision in Ferozepur district, who had committed suicide, were consigned to flames on Wednesday under tight police security.

 Allegedly peeved over political and police pressure in a case related to land dispute, Jatinder (25) had taken the extreme step on April 29. His father Mahinder Singh alleged that some leaders of the ruling Congress, with the help of police, had been pressurizing them to vacate nine acres, which they had been tilling for the last 70 years. “Our opponents had managed to get Section 145 (procedure where dispute concerning land or water is likely to cause breach of peace) of the CrPC imposed on the disputed land. This incident upset Jatinder, who was under depression, and he ended his life by hanging himself,” Mahinder alleged.
 
 Demanding justice and action against the persons responsible for Jatinder’s death, his family and several villagers placed the body outside Zira police station in protest. They agreed to cremate it after assurances of a fair probe in the matter.
 
 Meanwhile, the police have booked five persons in this regard. The accused, identified as Rachhpal Singh, his wife Sarbjit Kaur, Jagtar Singh, Gurjit Singh and Nishan Singh were booked for allegedly forcing Jatinder to end his life. The police have formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter and submit a report within a month, officials said.
 
 The victim’s family also demanded action against Inderjit Singh Zira, president of the Kisan Cell of Punjab Congress, alleging that he, along with his supporters, had attacked them when they were protesting. Zira claimed that the farmers participating in the protest belonged to SAD. “As per my information, Jatinder had committed suicide for some other reason. Some persons owing allegiance to the SAD were trying to derive political benefit from the entire situation,” he claimed.
