LUCKNOW:   will move the high court in July for early hearing of Lucknow University students union  . 

  elections were last held in 2005. In 2012, the university had announced the students union elections but they were stayed by the high court on a petition filed by a student leader.
 
 Now, the UP government has directed all state universities, including LU, to hold students union polls in August this year. “The university will hold the students union elections as per the   committee recommendations if the stay is vacated by the high court. We will move the court for early hearing,” said vice-chancellor  . 
 
 “Lyngdoh committee recommendations provide four categorisations for students’ union polls. The universities have to pick one of these categorisations for the polls. Last year, LU had decided to hold the future students’ union polls under ‘direct elections’ categorisation under which students elect their representatives through secret ballot,’ said university spokesman  . “If the stay is vacated the university will submit its categorisation before the high court for organising the elections,” added Pandey. 
 
 In 2007, the students union elections were banned in all UP universities by the Mayawati government. Later, the ban was lifted but it was left to the universities to decide whether they wanted to hold elections. LU decided to hold elections in 2012 but they were stayed by the high court.
