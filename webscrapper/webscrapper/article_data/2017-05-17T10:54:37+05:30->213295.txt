PATIALA: All fire extinguishers in the office of the Senior Superintendent of Police in   were past their expiry date, by about two years. Almost all other government departments had extinguishers that could no longer work.
 
 Recent fire incidents have brought into sharp focus the poor state of maintenance of firefighting equipment in commercial and government buildings.A check at the   (PMC) and the   fire department revealed poor preparedness to handle a fire incident.
 
 The fire department of Patiala has not raised even a single objection to the failure of commercial and government buildings to maintain fire-safety equipment at required standards. Officials, however, put this down to a dearth of staff. Fire personnel have also neglected making inspections of private and government buildings at regular intervals.
 
 Most private commercial buildings that TOI visited had no fire extinguishers at all.
 
 Fire officer   of Patiala said, “We face huge staff shortage. We have already written to higher authorities about the need for recruitment. We will now start inspecting private and government buildings.“
