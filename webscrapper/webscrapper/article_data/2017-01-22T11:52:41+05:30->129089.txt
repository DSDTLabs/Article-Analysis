AGRA: Two men were allegedly found murdered in a   at   on Saturday.

  The victims were identified as Rahul (25) and   (28), both employees of the store. They were allegedly strangulated and their bodies were found locked inside a small chamber. Police had to break open the lock to recover the bodies.
 
  The liquor store, owned by a Rajasthani businessman  , was being run by three salesmen. While Kamlesh had joined only on January 5, Rahul had been working in the same shop for a year. They used to live in the shop itself.
  Raghuraj singh, station officer of New Agra, said, “We are yet to retrieve the CCTV footage of the store. We have detained four men including the cashier and are interrogating them.”
 
  Assistant superintendent of police and circle officer Anurag Vats said, “Prima facie, the incident seems to be the outcome of a drunken brawl. It is likely that more people are involved in the crime.”
 
  Talking to TOI, Rahul’s father Rajbahadur said, “He was killed for Rs 2 lakh which was kept in the store.” He claimed that Rahul was planning to deposit the cash in the bank on Saturday in order to repay a loan that he had taken for his marriage. Baldev, the third salesman of the store who left at around 2 pm on Friday, told TOI, “The CCTV camera installed in the store must have recorded the incident. The culprits will not be able to escape.”
 
  Shanky, owner of a garment store in the vicinity, said, “The two men were spotted in the market at around 11.30 pm and looked normal. Police will be able to retrieve the CCTV footage from the shop.”
 
  Meanwhile, police have sealed the store and sent the bodies for postmortem.
