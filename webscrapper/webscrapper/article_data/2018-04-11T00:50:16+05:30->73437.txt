Erode: A sub-inspector of Vellode police station in Erode district was transferred to Armed Reserve (AR) on Tuesday after he damaged tree saplings planted by school students at Sanarpalayam village near Perundurai.

 The transfer order was issued by R Sivakumar, superintendent of police, after a departmental inquiry proved that the sub-inspector, S Loganathan, acted rudely to students and villagers. 
 
 “A group of students from the government school in the village had planted tree saplings along Makaliamman Street. A few saplings were planted in front of building under construction and houses. The house owners and engineers asked the villagers to remove the saplings. But the villagers refused to do so,” said an officer from SP office. “Meanwhile, one of the engineer V Jayachandran on Monday lodged complaint with Vellode police that the villagers were threatening him to death. Loganathan came to the village and asked the villagers to remove the saplings. When they refused to comply, he started plucking the saplings,” said the officer.
 
 Villagers, who caught the sub-inspector’s act on camera, released the videos in social media like WhatsApp and Facebook. The videos went viral and caught the attention of the superintendent of police. 
 
 Following this, he ordered an inquiry. Based on the report, the SP ordered the transfer of SI to Armed Reserve and copy of the order was issued to the SI on Tuesday.
