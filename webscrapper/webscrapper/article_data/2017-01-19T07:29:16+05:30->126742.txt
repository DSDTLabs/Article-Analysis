BENGALURU: A   gold medallist allegedly came in contact with an   and was electrocuted on Tuesday. 

  Gayathri Somashekar, 21, who got married to software engineer Somashekar two months ago, was alone at home in Indirangar's Michael Palya. Somashekar returned from work at 7pm and knocked on the door several times. A burning smell from the house made him suspicious and he broke open the rear door to enter the house, police said. 
 
 He found Gayathri lying on the bathroom floor. Police said there was a geyser but it had stopped working because of a wiring problem. "The couple was using the immersion rod till the geyser was fixed. We suspect Gayathri didn't know how to use it and may have touched it accidentally," an officer said.
 
  The girl's family, who arrived from Hassan on Wednesday, said she was a bright student and wanted to pursue a career in Bengaluru. Gayathri scored 96% and 93% in her SSLC and PUC. She was also a   from Mysore varsity, they told police. Cops ruled out foul play and said it was a clear case of accident.
