CUTTACK: The   (CMC) has plans to set up four e-seva kendras in the city to provide better facilities to the people. The e-seva kendra will serve as one-stop centres, where people can pay all their taxes online and get certificates and licences.

  The centre will come up at College Square, CDA, Jagatpur and Gopalpur. "We are looking for sites at these four places to set up e-seva kendra, said mayor Meenakshi Behera. She said the CMC aims to ensure timely and effective services to people. At present, the civic body collects taxes online at its offices at Choudhary Bazaar and Bikash Bhawan, Badambadi. People from across the city have to visit these two offices to pay their taxes and collect certificates. 
 
 "When the four e-seva kendras come up, then people can easily pay their taxes at nearby online centres. The facility will save a lot of time of people," said the mayor. At the e-seva centre, people can avail death and birth certificates, marriage certificates, trade licenses, pay holding tax, electricity and water tax online.CMC has 59 wards.
 
 At present, people are facing loads of difficulties as they have to rush to CMC offices for every odd work. "I pay my holding tax once every two years at I cannot come down to CMC office every month to pay my taxes. The CMC office is very far from my house," said Lalat Das, a resident of Gopalpur.
 
 CMC officials claimed that a special online portal will be designed through which different departments can collect taxes easily. Besides, appropriate facilities like drinking water and toilets will be created at the e-seva kendra for denizens. After identification of sites, budget for the project will be allocated, said a CMC official. Denizens have also welcomed the move. At the end of every month, we have to rush to CMC, electricity office and water office to pay our bills. "It would be great if we can pay all bills at one place," said  , a lawyer who resides at CDA.
