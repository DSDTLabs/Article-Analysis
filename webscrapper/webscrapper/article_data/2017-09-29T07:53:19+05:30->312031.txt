HAKIMPET: A Narshima Reddy, a   supervisor, was overseeing work near the accident site when he saw a plane swaying like a bird before it crashed into trees. He was still dumbstruck when TOI caught up with him. Here is his account: I first thought the pilot was doing some   and since we work here, we keep seeing fighter pilots practice different manoeuvres every other day.There were about 50 workers at the field when the aircraft spiralled out of control. Some of my men were in their quarters adjacent to the accident spot and some were working in the granite quarry .

 Some of us who were taking a nap thought it was an earth mover, but I could smell something burning.
 
 One of my workers recollected how the   in the air and spun before it crashed on the ground. We immediately moved to a safe distance, heard a huge sound and then a big blast.
 
 We took some time to figure out what had happened and we soon saw huge flames ema nating near the quarters.When we rushed to the spot, we saw flames and smoke billowing out of the aircraft. We immediately called police, who reached there immediately. We saw huge flames and trees burning, with the place filled with columns of smoke.
 
 Initially, we thought a pilot was inside the wreckage, but after examining the aircraft we saw it was empty. One of my labourers later confirmed that the pilot had ejected safely and we heaved a sigh of relief. We were scared as we had flammable material like diesel and other chemicals stored at our quarters. If the aircraft had crashed on our quarters, which is just 200 meters away from the site, it would have resulted in a major tragedy as many workers were in their rooms.
