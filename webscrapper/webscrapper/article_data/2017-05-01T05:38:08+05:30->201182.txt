NEW DELHI: Following sustained pressure from the Supreme Court, states have finally agreed to fill huge vacancies in their   forces with Uttar Pradesh promising to fill over 33,200 posts of sub-inspectors and constables each year for the next four years starting from 2018. 

 An angry SC bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar had summoned senior home department officials of three states at a time to take stock of the recruitment drives to fill vacancies plaguing the police and their ability to provide effective security to citizens and maintain law and order. After UP promised to fill 33,200 posts each year — 30,000 constables and 3,200 sub-inspectors — the bench made the state’s principal secretary (home) Debashis Panda, who was present in court, responsible for selection, recruitment and training as per the schedule given to the court. 
 
 “For ensuring that the submission made to this court is not breached, we direct the principal secretary (home) to ensure that the chairman of police recruitment and selection board shall not be changed midstream, that is during the period intervening issuance of advertisement (for filling up vacancies of different cadres) till process of selection is completed. In case of breach of the timelines indicated hereinabove, the officer mentioned hereinabove (Panda) shall be personally responsible,” a bench of the CJI and Justice D Y Chandrachud said. 
 
 The SC’s tough stand helped. Two other states — Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — immediately fell in line and promised quick filling up of vacancies in police departments. Karnataka promised to fill nearly 4,400 posts annually — 4,050 constables and 320 sub-inspectors — for the next three years starting from this year. Tamil Nadu aimed much higher, promising to fill 17,589 vacancies by April 2018. 
 
 The SC has asked top officials of West Bengal, which has over 37,000 vacancies, and three more states — Gujarat (28,580 vacancies), Telangana (17,504) and Rajasthan (15,731) — to be present in court on Monday for issuance of directions. 
 
 The court had found 4.42 lakh posts vacant in police departments in states and Union territories, which together have a sanctioned strength of 17.95 lakh personnel. UP’s sanctioned strength of 3.5 lakh is depleted by 1.51 lakh vacancies while West Bengal’s total strength of 1.02 lakh is short by 37,325. Other states with large vacancies include Bihar, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Haryana.
