The   are in rip roaring form. They are defending small totals and then in their game against the Delhi Daredevils they showed they can win chasing too. It was not a huge target by any means for they were asked to score at a little more than eight runs per over, but the Sunrisers showed that they could play catch up too after the asking rate climbed up. Their skipper   is the glue that holds the team together. Last season, he didn’t play most of the games since only four overseas players can play in the eleven and their skipper   was the preferred batting option.

 
 
 
 
 
 This year, with Warner not there and with the additional responsibility of captaining the team, the New Zealand captain has raised the level of the game several notches and in the process showed that a batsman does not have to be a blaster to score at a good clip and more importantly be consistent as well. The other aspect that is seen about Williamson is how cool he stays even when things seem to be unravelling for the team. In this he is quite like   whose cool exterior keeps the jittery team member cool too.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 While they are pretty sure to qualify, that is not a certainty for their opponents RCB, who have to win every single game now to qualify. The poor total against their southern neighbours Chennai didn’t help for it may well come down to the net run rate and those kind of totals hurt you. Once again, their fielding let them down with simple catches being floored that allowed   to win with an over to spare.
