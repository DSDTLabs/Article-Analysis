SALEM: Most   State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses remained off the road in the   region comprising Namakkal, Dharmapuri,  , Salem and Erode districts on Friday as part of the state-wide indefinite bus strike called by various unions.

 While close to 86% of buses operated normally in Salem district, the strike threw the normal life out of gear in the other districts. The transport department officials operated the buses with the police escort.
 
 Salem collector Rohini R Bhajibhakare, who inspected the transport department offices and bus stands in the city, said she had taken steps to operate 100% buses in the district. “Around 86% buses have operated as usual,” she said. The collector also said at least 200 drivers and conductors were kept ready to operate buses in case of any emergency.
 
 Trade union members had called for an indefinite strike across the state demanding renewal of three-year wage agreement and other pension related issues from Thursday night.
 
 People employed with private companies in Bengaluru were stranded as buses halted services at Hosur in Krishnagiri on Thursday night. According to TNSTC officials, a total of 850 buses ply to Bengaluru via Hosur from Tamil Nadu. “About 90% of buses to Bengaluru remained off the road on Friday,” said an official.
 
 However, Karnataka State Region Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operated buses as usual to Tamil Nadu via Hosur. The passengers to Bengaluru made use of the facility.
 
 Nearly 90% of buses were halted in the depots in Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Namakkal and Erode districts.
