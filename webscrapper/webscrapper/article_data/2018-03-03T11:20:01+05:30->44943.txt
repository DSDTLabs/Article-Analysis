VISAKHAPATNAM: Several IAS officers are involved in the denotification of two land parcels in the district, alleged YSR Congress officialspokesperson P  . 

 Speaking to the media here on Thursday, Murthy Yadav said joint collector G Srijana had sent a file to the revenue divisional officer seeking appropriate action with regards to the denotification of surplus land to the tune of 9.18 acres in   on October 1 last year.
 
 “Later, based on the RDO court judgment on October 5, 2017, district collector   denotified the land on December 4. However, on December 24, joint collector Srijana asked the land reforms tribunal to approach the court against the denotification and the appeal is pending in court. Why did the joint collector wait for two months to appeal in court? While the issue is pending before the court, collector Pravin Kumar denotified another 19.6 acre land in Madhurawada in January 2018. All these indicate the cooperation of these IAS officers in the land denotification,” Murthy Yadav alleged.
