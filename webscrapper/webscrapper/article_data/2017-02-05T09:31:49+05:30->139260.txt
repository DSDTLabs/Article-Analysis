HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has decided to tone down its strident stand on resolving disputes with Andhra Pradesh. It will now offer sharing of the higher education council in lieu of transfer of the secretariat buildings in AP's control. Till now, Telangana has been reluctant to concede a share in the higher education council to its counterpart. This forced AP to move   to get an interim direction. 

 As the tussle showed no signs of abating, Union home ministry told Governor   to use his office to set in motion a dialogue between the sparring states. The first meeting was held on February 1 in which the Governor convinced both states to hammer out a formula to settle pending issues. He also advised both states to come one step down to arrive at an amicable solution. In response to the governor's advice, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed senior officials to figure out a solution that would be a win-win situation for both states.
 
 "We are ready for an amicable solution within the framework of the Reorganization Act. We are proactive and keen to present a workable solution to all contentious issues. But AP has to respond positively," Rajiv Sharma, chief advisor of Telangana government told TOI. The Telangana government wants that after taking its share in the council, AP should not expand its wish-list, instead end the dispute. Blocks L, K, J and H in Secretariat premises are in the possession of AP, but after its staff moved to Vijayawada, all buildings are vacant and under lock and key. Telangana wanted to remodel the secretariat premises to accommodate all government offices at one place after taking over AP buildings. However, Telangana officials are sceptic over AP's response as the latter is seeking a share in 132 institutions in Hyderabad city and surroundings. These include the huge land bank held by agriculture university, MCR HRD institute, AP Foods, APSRTC, Vidyuth Soudha and Jala Soudha.
