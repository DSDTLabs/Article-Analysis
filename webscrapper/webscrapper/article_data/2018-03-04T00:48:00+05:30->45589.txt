 Madurai: It was a day of fun and frolic at Madurai East panchayat union elementary school at Y Othakadai on Saturday as traditional games were conducted as part of its 83rd sports meet. The games, 14 in all, included pallankuzhi, thayam, paramapadam (snake & ladder), pandiyattam, marbles, silambam, pambaram (top), pachakudirai and kannamoochi.
 
 Driving home the significance of the games, school headmaster Thennavan said that television and mobile games seemed to be the only entertainment of students today. As a result, students lacked physical activity like playing games on playgrounds or school surroundings. “The problem with spending time in virtual games is that students are prone to losing their creativity, memory power and positive thinking. They tend to become more aggressive and harbour negative thoughts. However, traditional games require children to think and play and they are full of fun with physical activity as well”, Thennavan said. 
 
 For instance, pallankuzhi, thayam and paramapadam were related to mathematics and required quick mental maths thereby augmenting memory power. This was the reason why the school had decided to organize traditional games for students at the sports meet, he said. 
 
 Nearly 230 boys and girls participated in the games transforming the campus into a fun zone. Godwin Rajkumar, physical education teacher of government boys higher secondary school, Alanganallur, inaugurated the sports meet while district education officer Jeyapal presided over the function.
