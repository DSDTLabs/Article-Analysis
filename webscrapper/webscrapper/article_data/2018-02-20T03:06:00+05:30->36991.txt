Visakhapatnam: This summer, people of the United Arab Emirates ( ) will get to relish the fruits imported from the city. 

 Two city-based firms have been making arrangements to export five varieties of fruits available in   — Banganapalli mango, papaya, apple, guava and pomegranate — to the Al-Aweer market in Dubai, which is the biggest provider of fruits and vegetables to the wider UAE region.
 
 The UAE normally imports fruits from China, Germany and Kenya. Now, due to efforts by Vizag fruit merchants, the UAE government has agreed to import fruits from the district. Speaking to TOI, a fruit exporter from Dubai said over phone that they have received permission from the Dubai municipality and willingness from Al-Aweer market management to import fruits from Vizag.
 
 As there is air connectivity between Vizag and Dubai, fruit exporters are negotiating with Sri Lankan Airlines, Air India and IndiGo to fly the fruit packets from Vizag to Dubai within six-seven hours.
 
 The fruit exporter, who didn’t want to be quoted, said while Sri Lankan Airlines can transport the fruits via Colombo, for Air India it will be via Hyderabad. IndiGo is also willing to provide the same service if there is big demand. “As of now, we are planning to export around 500 kgs of each variety on trial basis. While mango, guava and papaya will be sourced locally, apple and pomegranate will be sourced from Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra,” he said.
 
 APCCIF president G Sambasiva Rao said, “We are exploring all possibilities to help the fruit exporters, including logistic and knowledge support, so that the fruit trade runs smoothly. By this summer, we will be able to export the fruits to Dubai.”
