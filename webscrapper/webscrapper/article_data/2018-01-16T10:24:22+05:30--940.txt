CHANDIGARH: In an attempt to set an example,   and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has suspended a third-year student who had abused mobile-phone technology to harass teachers and try and blackmail a junior.

 This is the first time when the college took such a serious disciplinary action and forwarded a complaint to the cyber cell of the   police. The student was caught using a mobile app that flashed his junior’s number and disguised his voice when he made vulgar calls to teachers. His cover was blown when the junior he tried to frame recognised the voice despite modification.
 
 The disciplinary committee formed in October under former GMCH director-principal Dr A K   had recommended suspending the student, making him pay Rs 5,000 as fine, and barring him from holding any campus office throughout college until completing his MBBS. “An action was promised when   was director principal. We are strict about maintaining discipline and have shared it with the teachers on many occasions,” GMCH director principal Dr BS   said. 
 
 Sources said the student is son of a reputed local doctor. “The action taken against the student seems more an eyewash. He was suspended after he took his examinations and the vacations started,” said a senior doctor in the GMCH. 
 
 However, there are even doctors who appreciate the move. “The suspension order will reflect in the character certificate of the student. This will teach a lesson to those who have taken this profession lightly,” said a member of the faculty.
 
 This is the first incident of its kind reported from the medical college. “If we fail to teach basic ethics in the medical college, we cannot come out with good doctors,” said Dr Chavan.
