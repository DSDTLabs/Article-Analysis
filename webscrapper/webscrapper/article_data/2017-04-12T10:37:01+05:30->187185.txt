NAGPUR: A petitioner moved to the   praying for immediate appointment of inquiry officer to probe Rs 150 crore   (NDCCB) scam.

 Omprakash Kamdi through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar also demanded completion of probe within a month. The case would come up for hearing before a division bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and justice Atul Chandurkar on Thursday.
 
 Kamdi along with 13 others had earlier filed a PIL in this regard after which the court passed stern orders setting a definitive time frame for appellate authority to his appeal within six months and trial court to take this case on priority. He again moved to the judiciary on Thursday, after Supreme Court rejected   MLA Sunil Kedarâ€™s Special Leave Petition (SLP) praying for inclusion of NABARD and cooperatives registrar in re-inquiry ordered against him.
 
 Based on earlier report by Yashwant Bagde, the   directed Kedar to cough up around Rs299 crore for the loss caused due to the scam. This was one of the biggest cooperative scandals of the country involving top politicians. The enquiry by Bagde was dubbed one of the slowest, as he took over in 2002 and was expected to complete it in a couple of years, but it took him over a decade.
