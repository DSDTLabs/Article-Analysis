Panaji: In its representation made to Union minister for commerce and industry Suresh Prabhu, the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) has requested that hotels with tariff rates above Rs7500, which have been declared as luxury and put under the 28% rating, be re-rated to an 18% classification so as to at least bring parity with the earlier rates. According to them, all establishments serving liquor cannot apply for the composition scheme, which is eligible for establishments having a turnover of up to Rs 75 lakh. This was not the case under the earlier VAT regime and is causing a lot of hardship to small establishments, the representation stated. Stating that the hospitality business thrives on the concept of ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (guest is equivalent to God), the representation said that hotel managements often offer complimentary meals to visitors as part of their standard business practices and that such meals should not attract the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
