GHAZIABAD: Two members of a gang, allegedly involved in running a   logistics company, were arrested on Thursday near   factory on National Highway 58 

 The two have been identified as  , owner of a truck and Raj Kumar, the truck driver. The mastermind of the gang, Satyapal Singh, a resident of Ashok Vihar 3 in Gurgaon, is absconding.
 
 According to police, Satyapal had created a fake website in the name of Fast Track International and got it registered on online e-commerce companies. Their modus operandi was to blackmail the customers after packing their household items and hiding them at a place. They used to demand a higher service charge and even after getting the extra amount, they never returned the products, said police.
 
 Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vaibhav Krishna said that the gang was busted after a digital marketing professional registered a complaint against them two days ago.
 
 “Vikas Gupta, who was shifting from Indirapuram’s Niti Khand area to Jhansi, had fallen in their trap. He had booked this fake company on March 26 for shifting the household items for Rs 15,500. But even after a week, the truck did not reach on their new address in Jhansi. In meantime, they started demanding Rs 28,5000 citing toll and other taxes they paid on their way,” said Krishna.
 
 Gupta then approached   police and filed a complaint. Police have recovered a truck-load of household items belonging to the complainant.
