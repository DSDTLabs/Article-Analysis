AHMEDABAD: Efforts to check   may have proved ineffective in the city but   ( ) has developed a   that allows people to breathe fresh air. 

 The mask is made using a special nano web-based technology and helps filter bacteria and virus. The technology has been developed by ATIRA. The mask is being designed by students and research experts at   (NID), Ahmedabad.
 
 Give more information about the new technology, RM Sankar, principal scientific officer, ATIRA, said that the mask has a “high filtration efficiency and is cost-effective”. 
 
 “It is designed in a way that it helps filter out germs, including bacteria and viruses as small as 0.01 microns, besides particulate matter (PM) 2.5 particles. Particulate matter are a major concern as far as air pollution in Ahmedabad is concerned,” Sankar said.
 
 Representatives from NID in Ahmedabad will design the mask and make it more user-friendly. They will also design the logo. Pradyumna Vyas, director, NID (Ahmedabad) said that this project is part of the collaboration between the two institutions. “Currently, we are in the process of finalizing the design of the product. Once done, we will explore avenues to market it further,” said Vyas.
 
 ATIRA plans to collaborate with the railways, airlines and airport authorities to put up vending machines at airports and at railway stations. The machines will dispense these masks.
 
 Earlier, in January, NID and ATIRA signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for setting up a Materials & Product Innovation Centre (MAPIC) for facilitating research in the areas of composites and nano web-based technology. MAPIC will be located at ATIRA and experts from both the institutions will work to bring cost-effective and efficient products that can be further marketed for mass usage.
