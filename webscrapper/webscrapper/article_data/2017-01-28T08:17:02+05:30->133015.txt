PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: An increasingly   has forced   to demand   Municipal Corporation ( ). 

 Last month, residents of the village had written to PCMC after which the water supply department tabled a proposal. According to the report, the village is located adjacent to Charholi village. PCMCâ€™s sewage treatment plant (STP) in Charholi is located close to the public well that supplies drinking water to Nirgude. 
 
 Local residents claim the treated sewage released from the STP is percolating into the well due to which the water is not potable. They have demanded 2.5 MLD water. However, the civic body has said the provision can be made only if Bhama Askhed and Andra dams become operational. Meanwhile, the civic proposal states that around 40,000 litres of water can be provided through tankers.
