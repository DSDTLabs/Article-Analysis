KOLKATA: Over 100   workers staged a protest outside the house of Union minister and West Bengal BJP member   in Kolkata on Wednesday, demanding his arrest in the   chit fund scam. 

 The party has termed “political vendetta” the recent arrest of it's MPs Tapas Paul and   over their alleged involvement in the scam. Last week, Paul had sought to drag Supriyo’s name into the investigation, saying “he was very close to Kundu (Rose Valley boss)”. 
 
 The protest came a day after TMC workers attacked BJP headquarters in Kolkata, and on a day people suspected to be members of TMC carried out another arson attack on an office of the saffron party in Hooghly. The Trinamool workers gathered outside the apartment complex where Supriyo has a house, Pearl Apartments, around 11.45am, when only the minister’s elderly parents were home. They also tried to storm into the premises, shouting slogans, but the bid was foiled as police, who already had information about the protest, had put up barricades and guard rails outside the main gate. 
 
 Though the Trinamool supporters were greater in number, police managed to disperse the mob. That the cops walked away immediately after the protesters left led BJP state president Dilip Ghosh to call the exercise a “sham”. The police “acted as puppets in the hands of the ruling party”, he added. 
 
  
  
 
 Babul later took to Twitter to vent his anger over the protest: “TMC goons trying to break open the gate of my apartment in Kailash Bose Street where my Mum, Dad are staying. What a shame”... Trinamool, however, denied the protest was wrong. “We protested in the most peaceful manner,” Trinamool member Sajal Ghosh said.
