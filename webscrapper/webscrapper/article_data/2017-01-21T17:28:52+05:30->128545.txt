KOLKATA: The mood of the rival camps came out in the open during India and England's pre-match practice session at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Saturday, a day before their third and final ODI.

 With the series in the pocket, the Indian team opted for an optional practice session.
 
 But their opposition came out in full strength for a lengthy three hours of training session in the afternoon.
 
 Apart from India skipper  , some notable names missing action in the morning were KL Rahul,  ,   and  .
 
 However, opener  , who went for a routine check-up of his injured right thumb at a private hospital on arrival in Kolkata from Cuttack on Friday, attended the nets.
 
 Ajinkya Rahana, who has not got a game so far, also had a long knocking session perhaps fancying his chances after the regular openers Rahul and Dhawan being not among runs so far.
 
  might no longer be wearing the arms band, but his inputs still remains important for the team think tank as the Jharkhand player was seen examining the pitch closing kneeling down on the wicket. 
 
 Although all those absent Indian players have contributed well in the last two matches, there has been no let off for any England players who seemed determined to avoid a whitewash on Sunday.
 
 Coach   had a peep talk with the boys before they got down to serious practice. Apart from regular batting and bowling sessions, special importance was given to fielding as England has let slip some advantageous situations in the last two ODIs due to sloppy ground fielding and poor catching.
