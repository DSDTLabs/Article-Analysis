GURUGRAM:   reeled under prolonged power cuts over the weekend as the spiking   resulted in overloading, which led to frequent tripping of the system.

  were reported from sectors 14, 21, 4, 6, 3,   1 and   Phase 4. In many areas, the cuts spanned for as long as four hours. 
 
 “The frequent cuts have gotten to our nerves now,” said Dinesh Aggarwal, RWA president, Sector 14. “The discom claims to provide us uninterrupted power supply but on ground nothing seems to happen. The residents make frequent calls to me hoping that I will forward their complaints to the officials concerned. But even officials take time to come to our areas and ascertain where the snag is.”
 
 Residents also complained that overnight power cuts not only keep them awake, but also make them unable to pump water the next morning.
 
 Mayank Singh, a resident of South City 1, told TOI power cuts have been worse in the area after May 9. “When we wake up, even the food in the refrigerator turns stale. Unlike others in this area, we cannot afford an inverter,” he said. 
 
 When TOI called power officials they denied that cuts were widespread. “The cuts often happen at individual level, and our men rectify the fault,” said OK Bhardwaj, sub-divisional officer of DHBVN’s Maruti sub-division. “On Saturday though, our substation at Mehrauli road experienced some disruption because power supply from the main line had been snapped. The power supply was later restored.”
