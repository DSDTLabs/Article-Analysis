MUMBAI:   has decided to provide reflective vests to porters. The move follows the death of two porters who were knocked down by a local near Vasai on April 23. WR will also appoint 64 more porters to fetch  . The new porters will be deployed between Churchgate and Dahanu.

 The Mumbai suburban system witnesses over 3,000 deaths and an equal number of injuries on railway tracks, either due to falls from trains or trespassing. Asenior WR official said, “We have decided that each porter gets a jacket with radium strips so that the motorman of an oncoming train spots them.”
 
 There are no protocols to ensure the safety of railway employees who are on duty on the tracks. “Some stations have one or two porters. However, we need at least four to lift a stretcher. The stationmaster has to go hunting for porters, who are not easy to find. The availability of porters will ensure that victims are attended to in time. These porters will work in a shift of 12 hours each,” said an official. A stationmaster said, “Porters are badly needed. Due to the shortage, we are forced to request shoe-shiners or drug addicts to help us. We have to pay money from our pockets to these men, who may later indulge in crimes.” A commuter, Shyam Pandya, said, “Railways should impose speed restrictions whenever information about an accident is relayed. This will ensure safety of those helping the victims.” AWR official said, “We thought through this idea but it is not feasible. The imposition of speed limit will slow down the trains, thus affecting punctuality which will lead to overcrowding. This may then lead to accidents due to train falls.”
