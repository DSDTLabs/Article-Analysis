Ranchi: On the occasion of the   when the state government introduced the   vaccine to tackle  , the newly-appointed principal secretary (health)   spoke to the TOI about the action plan to address   among the children of the state.

  became the 10th state to introduce vaccine against rotavirus on Saturday, which coincided with the World Health Day, at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims).
 
 Khare told TOI: “The parents have to be made aware that breastfeeding within the first hour is a must. Mother’s milk is the best nutrition that an infant can get. Continuing it for the first six months can keep a child away from various diseases.”
 
 Khare said around 20 years ago, diarrhoea was rampant during monsoon in Seraikela-Kharsawan district. It claimed the lives of many infants at villages in Kuchai block of the district. She said the lack of awareness among the villagers made them link diarrhoeal deaths to witchcraft. Many women were branded ‘witches’ and lynched in the region after the villagers blamed them for the deaths of their children. 
 
 “We still have a lot to do to reduce infant mortality rate in Jharkhand, where it is less than the national average. The vaccine will help us control a disease as common as diarrhoea, but which has far-reaching impact on the lives of the people and the development of the state,” Khare said. 
 
 “We have rid most districts of open defecation, which is also another cause of diarrhoea among children,” Nidhi Khare said. 
 
 Khare said around 4,000 auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), GNM and health workers were trained in last two months to carry out the immunisation programme. 
 
 She said, “The rotavirus immunisation programme will be monitored extensively. We will ensure the vials of vaccine are stored efficiently in cold chains to ensure their effective usage,” adding, “The rotavirus immunisation is yet another step of the state government towards strengthening its preventive paediatrics care mechanism.”
