JAIPUR: Four men, including Delhi-based activist   of the National Campaign for the Eradication of Bonded Labourers, were allegedly attacked at Saipau in Dholpur, after they successfully rescued about 35 people trapped in bonded labour in the kilns in the area.

 Tara Chand Verma, advocate associated with  , told TOI that the cell phones of the activists were snatched away and they were left without means to contact family or friends. “People associated with the brick kiln owner attacked the activists. We are now unable even to reach them on phone,” he said. The labourers were working as whole families at the kiln; a number of women and children were also present among rescued labourers, he said.
 
 District SP Rajesh Singh said it could not really be called an attack. “There was a discussion to settle all accounts with the labourers, who were here from Chhattisgarh. Matters got out of hand then and there was a skirmish between negotiating parties. We have registered a case. The police had accompanied the NGO workers during the rescue, this skirmish occurred later. Matters have since been settled, the NGO workers have all left.”
 
 Range IGP Alok Vashisht told TOI he was initially told that rescue of child labourers had occurred in Dholpur, and that the district magistrate and police personnel were also at the spot. He said a lawyer later called, seeking his intervention after another incident occurred at the spot. He said he was not aware of the details of the matter.
