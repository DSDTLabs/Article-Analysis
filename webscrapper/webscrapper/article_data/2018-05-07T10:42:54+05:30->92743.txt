PATIALA: The district   here carried out a massive raid inside the   maximum security jail on Sunday morning, during which more than 200 cops searched each and every prison.

 Even after three hours of search, the raiding team could not find three mobile chargers, hinting that these were still being used inside the prison. The cops are now fearing that the information regarding the massive raid could have been leaked, prompting the violators to hide the banned devices and other related things before the cops came. 
 
 The team of 200 cops, including woman constables, was led by a senior police official, who, along with four DSPs and 15 SHOs from various police stations, searched the maximum security jail for over three hours.
 
 Amarjit  , SP, who led the raiding party, said the operation was kept a secret and none, including the members of the team, had been informed about the operation. He said the team reached the jail premises around 4am but it took around 20 to 30 minutes for the jail staff to open the gates. He said that they were apprehensive that the guards standing atop the towers might have got to know about the raid by seeing the number of the cops and the information could have been spread inside the jail, which could have given enough time to the inmates to hide any banned substances or devices.
 
 He said that they would be discussing the matter with senior cops regarding the delay in opening the jail gates and would try and find a solution to this so that any leak of information regarding the raid is plugged. â€œWhile the time to open cells is around 6am, the team asked the jail officials to open these before time so that the barracks could be thoroughly checked.
