BHOPAL: Bone-chilling cold gripped the city on Thursday with the temperature dipping to 6.6 degrees Celsius — the lowest of the season, and four degrees below normal.

 It’s a sharp drop from the minimum of 9.5 degrees recorded on Wednesday, and the weatherman warns of a cold wave on Republic Day.
 
 This January has been a story of yo-yo temperature. On January 3, the city shivered at 7.7 degrees, and a few days later it got so warm that   ditched woolens for cottons. But on Thursday, an 14kmph wind added to the chill and made people cover up at noon. The temperature in   dropped close to freezing at 2 degrees Celsius. The lowest temperature in the plains was recorded at 4 degrees in Raisen, Mandala and Betul.
