TRICHY: Nungu or palmyra fruit, a much sought after fruit to beat the heat, is both costlier and scarce this year owing to sourcing difficulties. Number of nungu stalls in the city has drastically declined. Price of nungu has also seen a sharp surge by at least 50% compared to last year. Nungu sellers attributed the price rise to limited availability of the fruit besides difficulty in sourcing skilled labour to harvest the fruits from palm trees.

 According to the  , out of the total 8.59 crore palm trees in India, a majority of 5.10 crore are in Tamil Nadu. However, owing to the felling and poor care, as many palm trees are planted on vacant lands, the number has gradually declined in the recent years. Horticulture department sources here said that number of palm trees is going down by 5%-10% each year.
 
 With summer underway, traders said that availability of nungu has been declining every year with tough competition among seasonal traders to source quality fruits from  , Ramanathapuram, and   districts. While a dozen nungu cost 40 last year in Trichy, it is 50-60 this year.
 
 “We are sourcing the fruit from Tuticorin as we could not source nungu from Trichy or Pudukkottai districts, this also adds the burden of transportation cost. Besides the heavy demand in purchasing nungu, we were told that skilled labours are a rarity now to find in harvesting the fruit from tall trees,” K Sakthiraja, nungu seller in Ponmalai said.
 
 In Ponmalai market, a dozen pieces of nungu was sold at Rs 60 while in   it cost Rs 50 for the same quantity. “It would take more than 20 years for a palm tree to bear fruits. Despite being the state’s official tree, poor emphasise was given for promoting the acreage of palm trees through which a lot of value-added products could be derived,” K C Neelamegam, a city-based environmentalist said. Small-time traders selling nungu in Trichy said that the prices may rise further in end of the month.
