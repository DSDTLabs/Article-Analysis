Madurai: The organs of a 40-year-old woman, who was declared brain dead after she met were transplanted to patients in different hospitals on Tuesday.

 Aruna, 40, wife of Gandhimathinathan of Thirunagar, was going to a relativeâ€™s house when she fell off her scooter and suffered head injuries. She was first admitted to a hospital in the area and later brought to Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC), where she was declared brain dead.
 
 The counsellors of the hospital told her husband and family that her organs could give a new lease of life to at least four more persons and also help two more to see, with her eyes. Her husband and family members came forward to donate her organs.
 
 After getting necessary approvals, doctors in MMHRC harvested her organs in a five hour surgery. The liver and one kidney were transplanted in two patients in MMHRC. The other kidney was sent to Apollo Hospitals in Trichy, while the heart was sent to the Fortis Malar hospital in Chennai.
 
 Eyes were donated to Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai. The gesture of the family to provide for others in time of their grief was appreciated by the doctors at the hospital.
