LUCKNOW: Traffic continued to remain disrupted from Polytechnic crossing to Vikramaditya Marg from 12pm to 3pm due to arrival of BJP’s national president at Samtamulak crossing on Wednesday.

 A cascading effect was seen on Lohia Path and other stretches including   flyover and Cantonment Road for three hours.
 
 School vans, ambulances, buses and those commuting towards the airport or railway station remained stranded.
 
 Puja Rai, who was going to visit   hospital from  , said traffic at Samtamulak crossing delayed her massively.
 
 “It took me two hours to reach the hospital in Hazratganj. Usually, it takes 25 minutes,” said Rai.
 
 Vinay Kumar, driver of a school van, said he got stuck at Mall Avenue flyover for one hour. “There was no policeman to regulate traffic,” he said.
 
 “I was going to the airport from Lalbagh. As VS Marg is crowded, I took Mall Avenue route to Cantt. But it was chock-a-block,” said Yasmin.
 
 “If there is a   movement, then sufficient police personnel should be deployed,” said Ashwini Srivastava.
 
 ASP (traffic) RS Nim said the diversions were not planned because the   president had to stay for a few minutes only. “We had taken assistance of police and were able to regulate traffic,” said Nim.
