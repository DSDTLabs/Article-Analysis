GREATER NOIDA: A gang tried to escape with an ATM located just 50 metres from   police post on Monday morning. Though the men tried to uproot the ATM using a gas cutter, they abandoned the idea when they realised there was no cash in the machine.

 The miscreants, however, made some holes in the ATM using the gas cutter. Police said the robbery bid happened 2 am at the ATM of Axis Bank in   on  .
 
 Police sources said the thieves had pulled down the shutters of the ATM before trying to uproot it. The gas cutter was found abandoned at the spot. Rajpal Tomar, SHO of Dankaur, said a three-member forensic team visited the spot and collected evidence, including fingerprints, from the ATM. “We have asked the Noida branch of Axis Bank for CCTV footage. Only then we will be clear about the number of people involved,” he said.
 
 A spokesperson for Axis Bank said they will share footage with the police soon.
 
 The police, however, are yet to lodge an FIR since a formal complaint is yet to be filed by the bank.
