Ahmedabad: Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday began its probe against the founder of Vadodara-based Sumandeep Vidyapith, in an alleged case of offences under the   (PMLA).

 Shah and two aides were accused of demanding bribes from students for admissions and to pass them in the exams. Cheques were taken from the students that would be returned after they paid him in cash. He was nabbed by ACB after his two aides were caught accepting a bribe of Rs 20 lakh. Later, larges sums of cash and property documents were found at his office.
 
 Shah and the two others were booked by the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB), which later found cheques amounting to Rs 102 crore at his office, besides receipts of Rs 65 crore in fixed deposits.
 
 Sources in the ED said Shah was suspected to be involved in money laundering and hence a probe has been started against the founder of the deemed university. ED is likely to take custody of Shah, who is now in Vadodara jail, to interrogate him.
