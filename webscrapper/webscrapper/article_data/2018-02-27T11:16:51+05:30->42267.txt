VARANASI:   MLA from Bairia in Ballia district,   has stirred a controversy again by saying that “people who do not chant ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ are Pakistanis”.

  
  
 
 At a public event in Ballia on Sunday, Singh said, “ Mein spasht roop se kehta hun ki jo log   aur   kahne se perhez karte hain, wo Pakistan ke hain(I clearly say that those who have reservation in saying Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai belong to Pakistan).”
 
 “ Maine is baat ko UP ki   mein bhi kaha hai ki aise lok Bharat ke nahi hain(I also said this in UP Vidhan Sabha that such people do not belong to India),” Singh added.
 
 Singh also accused All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi and senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan of having such mindset.
 
 “Such people have no right to do politics. It is the weakness of democracy that such people are active in politics,” he said.
 
 Singh added that “the Constitution should have a provision to debar such people from contesting elections who call Bharat Mata a‘dayen’ (witch)”.
 
 Speaking on illegal mining, the MLA advised people “to give two slaps to the police (personnel)” if they are stopped by them for taking sand for their personal use.
 
 “If police can catch hold of a thief and humiliate him, people can also give the same treatment to the police,” Singh said.
 
 This is not the first time that Singh has courted a controversy. Earlier, he said within 2024 India would become a Hindu nation and once it becomes Hindurashtra, only those Muslims will stay in the country who assimilate into the Hindu culture.
