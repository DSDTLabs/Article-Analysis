LUCKNOW: Played once upon a time in the imperial court of Nawab  , the tunes of  , a bass   that gradually faded into oblivion will be heard in the city once again.

 Trained exponent Ashwin Dalvi from Jaipur who has been playing the rare   for the past 20 years will perform at Sangeet Natak Academy on Monday.
 
 Dalvi said he came to know from his gurus and other mucisians that the instrument has a strong connect with the city as it was shaped by musician Umrao Khan Beenkar here, in the year 1820. Umrao, who was an eminent rudra veena player in the Mughal court made the string-instrument for his beloved student Ghulam Mohammed Khan.
 
 “It is said rudra veena artists in those days were possessive about their art and made sure it does not go out of their family. Bound by the pact, Umrao created Surbahar for Ghulam,” said Dalvi.
 
 “Over 150cm long, the instrument is not only a lookalike of rudra veena, the manner of playing and the sound created by it was also similar.” Since then, Surbahar, was played in the royal courts of   and musicians who were trained to play it were found only in the city.
 
 In the 19th century, however, when Wajid Ali Shah left Lucknow, along with him went all court musicians and the city lost its very own musical instrument. Gradually, its place was taken by sitar as it was handier and could also produce fast paced music.
 
 Historian Yogesh Praveen said, “There are several tales about Surbahar being invented in Lucknow and it is also said it gained immense popularity during Mughal era. Some people believe the instrument came from Etawah Gharana.”
 
 Convenor of the musical event being held on the occasion of his mother’s death anniversary, Raghav Naresh said, “Patrons will not only witness the recital they would also get the chance to know tales associated with the origin and popularity of Surbahar in the bygone glorious Awadhi times.”
