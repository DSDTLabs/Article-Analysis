Mysuru: ‘Clean conscience-clean Mysuru’ is the new mantra proposed by former Indian cricketer   in the third TOI-led   campaign in Kuvempu Nagar, an upscale area in the city on Wednesday morning.

 The event was held at Vidyavardhaka School of Kuvempu Nagar. 
 
 Srinath in his speech invoked two values — conscience and right attitude — which can help students create awareness about a clean and green Mysuru among the general public.
 
 “First we need a clean conscience. Once we are able to achieve it, we can easily transform others. For example, if you find anyone spitting in open, please address them as uncle or aunty, they will understand what you are trying to communicate,” he said.
 
 “Just try to change at least five people in a month. Request them with folded hands. Your message would be loud and clear,” he said.
 
 “Students need to go an extra mile to complete their task. Please create awareness about the importance of waste segregation at source and try and make at least three neighbours each on both sides of your house to buy blue and green dustbins. If they do not buy in the first month, alert them in the second month. If every student does this, the whole city will become clean. This is a year-long process,” he said.
 
 “Service to others will lead to serious attitude change. It will always be positive. Nothing in life is greater than asking someone to be happy. We need to nurture good habits, good attitude, and commitment towards the society,” he said.
 
 “I have travelled across the country and Mysuru is one of the cleanest cities. But every day thousands of people visit this city. From villagers to tourists, every one come here. So, maintaining cleanliness must be a routine process,” he added.
