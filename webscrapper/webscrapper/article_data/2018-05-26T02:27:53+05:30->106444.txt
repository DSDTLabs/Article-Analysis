MUMBAI: The southwest   arrived in the south   on Friday and is likely to make an early entry into   coast in four days, the   said on Friday. Since the IMD weather models show a rapid monsoon progress after its arrival in Kerala, good rainfall activity is likely over parts of central India, which includes  , after May 31 till June 6 and probably, during the first half of June.

 Monsoon’s onset over Kerala marks the rain system’s arrival over the mainland. If IMD’s forecast holds, monsoon will have arrived this year three days ahead of its normal date.
 
 “All parameters indicate that the monsoon is likely to arrive over Kerala between May 27 and 29,” said M Mohapatra, director general (meteorology), IMD. This is in line with the IMD forecast on May 18, which said the system is likely to arrive over Kerala on May 29, with a model error of 4 days.
 
 The IMD weather models indicate that the monsoon is on course for rapid progress in the next two weeks. These models show that after Kerala, monsoon may stride into central, east and northeast India by June 14. Sources said these models are bias corrected, indicating a fairly precise picture up to two weeks from the initial forecast date. A play of four days, plus or minus, is taken into account.
