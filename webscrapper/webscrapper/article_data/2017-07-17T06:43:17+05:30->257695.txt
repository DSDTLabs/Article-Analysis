CHENNAI: Nearly 215 days after it was damaged, the   at the   on   started functioning from Saturday after new cables were laid for the signal. The signals were damaged in cyclone Vardah which hit the city last December.

 This is one among the 99 places in the city, where the Chennai city traffic police have installed new pillars and traffic signals replacing the old and worn out signal system. The   junction is one of the most important ones in the city, where at least 30,000 to 40,000 vehicles pass through on any given day.
 
 Moreover, due to the metrorail work on Anna Salai, traffic has been re-routed. Only vehicles from Anna flyover are allowed to reach the Spencer Plaza signal. With vehicles flooding in on both sides of the road on Anna Salai, police had a tough time handling the huge volume of traffic especially during the night.
 
 “If the signals are working, it will be easy for us to man the traffic. Sometimes, the vehicles may pass through very fast even after the traffic policeman signalled to stop the vehicles and allowed the other side to proceed further,” said a traffic head constable in the city traffic wing. He added that in the night, they block one lane by placing barricades to block vehicles from proceeding on one side of the road to restrict traffic.
 
 Chennai city traffic police have replaced the existing system with the new signal system. In spite of the state government sanctioning money to replace traffic signals damaged due to the Vardah cyclone, funds were not utilized properly and work was stalled, as officers had other pressing priorities.
 
 A senior police officer said, “After A K Viswanathan assumed charge as the new city police commissioner in May 13, this year, the traffic police officers informed about long-pending issue to replace the signals.” Things moved at a fast pace and sanctions were cleared to   in a flash, the officer added.
