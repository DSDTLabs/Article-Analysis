PATNA: Women MLAs from all political parties on Wednesday demanded 50% reservation for them in the   and state assembly. 

 The women lawmakers showed exemplary unity in their ranks omitting all the political differences, as they were making the demand on the occasion of International Women’s Day. They also shouted slogans on the issue and in support of their demand in the assembly.
 
 Earlier, when the House met for the pre-lunch session, Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary recalled the significance of the day. No sooner the house proceedings started, the women lawmakers stood on their seats and started demanding 50% reservation for them in the Lok Sabha and state assembly.
 
 The women lawmakers who shouted slogans with regard to their demand rather spiritedly included Ranju Geeta from the JD(U), Amita Bhushan from the Congress, Ajia Devi from the RJD and Asha Devi from the BJP. The other women lawmakers also shouted slogans like ‘Lok Sabha, Vidhan Sabha main, pachaas pratishat arakshan dena hoga’. There are 28 women MLAs in Bihar.
 
 Parliamentary affairs minister Shrawan Kumar said his party JD(U) favoured and supported their demand, but also asked the BJP members to request the NDA government at the Centre to get it passed in Parliament.
