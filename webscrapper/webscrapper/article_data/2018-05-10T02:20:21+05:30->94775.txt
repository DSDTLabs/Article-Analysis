GHAZIABAD: The private player roped in by the UP government for introducing battery-operated e-buses, conducted a traffic survey on Wednesday and chalked out possible routes. The project is in the nascent stage as   is yet to deduce a financial model that would be adopted for the project.

 According to Ritu Maheshwari, vice-chairperson, GDA, “ The genesis of introducing e-buses in the city could be traced to just concluded UP Investors Summit where Essel Infraprojects Ltd signed an MoU with the UP government, in which the company committed an investment of Rs 3,000 crore for rolling out e-buses in the state and the NCR. The company was asked to prepare a report to assess the feasibility of plying e-buses within the city’s limit and on Wednesday their representatives presented the report.”
 
 
  
 
 To start with, the company had conducted surveys on four possible routes — Dilshad Garden to Lal Kuan (Red Line),   to Morta (Blue line) Kaushambi to Lal Kuan (Green line) and Bhopura to Morta (Brown Line).
 
 “The routes have been selected keeping in mind the last-mile connectivity as is evident from the stopovers that have been proposed,” said an official from Essel Infraprojects. 
 
 “E-buses is the need of the hour, especially in   that has earned a dubious distinction of being the most polluted city in the country during last winter,” he added.
 
 But GDA vice chairperson Ritu Maheshwari sounded cautious before throwing her weight behind the project. 
 
 “ It is in a very initial phase and there are a lot of rough edges that need to be thrashed out and major one being a financial model that would be adopted,” she said.
