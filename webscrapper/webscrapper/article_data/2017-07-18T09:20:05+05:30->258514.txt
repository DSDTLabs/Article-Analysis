TRICHY: In a first-of-its-kind initiative in the city, an online   was inaugurated at a corporation middle school at   on Monday. 

 Children can now be exposed to the virtual learning environment-a web-based platform- which will enhance their learning experience. “The new facility will kindle curiosity and thinking ability among children,” said headmistress D  , who has borne the whole cost of Rs 1.83 lakh for setting up the facility.
 
 The school had just 56 students in the academic year 2015-16. However the numbers increased to 109 in the 2016-17 session after a smart classroom, an application-based learning technique, was introduced in the school using funds provided by the government.
 
 “We realised that parents wanted their children to learn new things. Parents opt for private schools due to the facilities available in them. After we introduced the smart classroom, we found the numbers increasing in our school,” said the headmistress.
 
 “As the number of students has risen to 165 this year, we decided to upgrade the facilities and introduced an online classroom this year,” she said. 
 
 The classroom has a smart board with a projector and speakers. With a computer attached to the facility, internet can be accessed to download relevant content. Besides, children can have live streaming of classes being taken in a government school at K Paramathi in  , she said. 
 
 “We have tied up with the school which has the same facility and the classes can be streamed live through Skype. The students will now get an opportunity to interact with students in other schools, sitting in their classrooms,” said Raja Rajeswari.
 
 The school has come up with its own blog highlighting its facilities. A data base has been created with the contact details of the parents of children studying in the school. “We will send regular alert messages to the parents on the performance of their children,” said the headmistress.
