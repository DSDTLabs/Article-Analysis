MUMBAI: In what has come as a pleasant surprise for thousands of pedestrians who walk along one of the city’s busiest commercial hubs at Senapati Bapat Marg in Lower Parel, a 2,700-square-metre stretch under the Ferguson flyover has been given a complete facelift.

 From LED lighting, pre- cast concrete benches and unique garbage bins to Rhapis palm planters that are known to absorb pollution, the erstwhile dingy space is a bright and welcome sight today.
 
 In the first phase, only the stretch outside   under the flyover was taken up for revamp.
 
 The flyover runs from   till Kamala Mills along Senapati Bapat Marg. “There are plans to revamp the entire space under the Ferguson flyover and also a portion of the Elphinstone flyover but all this would be done in a phased manner,” said Devendra Kumar Jain, assistant commissioner, G-South Ward.
 
 Civic officials told TOI that it was the   ( ) that first showed interest in revamping the space. The BMC thereafter carried out the revamp in partnership with it.
 
 MMRA is known to have included stakeholders from nearby areas, including residents’ associations, offices and developers in the project.
 
 Studio Pomegranate, architects who designed the space, said they had to study the locality in detail before deciding on what needed to be done.
 
 Shweta Chhatpar Shah, one of the architects, said that they kept the design minimalistic to ensure ease of pedestrian movement.
 
 “The area has been opened up in such a manner that it can be used for walking or sitting by anyone, from officer-goers to local residents from the neighbourhood chawls. Garbage bins with compartments for wet and dry garbage have been placed too,” she said.
 
 Pranav Naik, another architect, said a taxi bay has also been created on both sides of the road under the flyover and aU-turn relocation designed to ease traffic chaos.
 
 There are plans to position beat marshals along the space to keep vagrants away.
