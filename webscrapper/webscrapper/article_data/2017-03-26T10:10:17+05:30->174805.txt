PANAJI: Goa Government Employees Association (GGEA) has welcomed the voluntary retirement scheme ( ) for lethargic employees, but fears it could be misused.

 GGEA president   said there are apprehensions that “the scheme could be misused to harass sincere employees who are not falling in line to engage in illegal activities”. 
 
 The association said it will discuss the issue with chief minister   so that there is no misuse of the provisions.
 
 “Most government employees attend duties in time and if there are few who reach late or are found napping during work hours, the association will not support them and on the contrary, request them to work with sincerity and dedication, and provide a prompt and friendly service to the public, without any corrupt practices and without late attendance,” Nazareth said. 
 
 The association also thanked the new coalition government for accepting GGEA’s demand and announcing its decision to extend the   scheme to government employees, with an option to opt for the scheme or the existing medical re-imbursement scheme. 
 
 “The government servants who are not able to cope up with the expectations of the citizens and the government for various personal or work-related reasons will be given an opportunity to take voluntary retirement,” Parrikar said in his budget speech on Friday.
