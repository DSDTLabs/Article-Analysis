Chennai: A month after police registered an FIR against the crew of the film  , which is supposed to be based on the sensational   murder case in   railway station, the victim’s father has lodged a complaint with Chennai city police commissioner A K Vishwanathan on Monday.

 Director of the film, Ramesh Selvam, producer Subbiah and script writer Ravi had filed a plea for anticipatory bail before the high court after Swathi’s father Santhana Gopalakrishnan filed a complaint with the director general of police on May 31, two days after the trailer of the movie was released. Gopalakrishnan had sought action against the trio, saying the film’s release would lead to emotional trauma of his family.
 
 Based on the complaint, Central Crime Branch (CCB) police registered cases against the filmmakers. The court, while considering their plea, posted the matter for further hearing on 21 June. Until then, the trio are not to be arrested, the court ordered.
 
 In his complaint Gopalakrishnan had earlier said no one took consent from his family for making the movie. In the fresh complaint, he has requested the police commissioner to pursue the case further.
