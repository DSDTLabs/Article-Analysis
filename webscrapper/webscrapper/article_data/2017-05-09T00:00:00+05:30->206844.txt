Helix tattoos are delicate tattoos that curve up around the edge, or helix, of the ear, negating the need for any jewellery. The cool   became popular thanks to Seoul-based tattoo artist Zihee, whose   is filled with tattoos. Now other versions of the trend are emerging, with people tattooing their cartilage, and even lobes. The most common tattoos are leafy vines, floral climbers, classic double cuff and monogram, but hey, who said you cannot have your favourite cartoon tattooed there?
