LUCKNOW: Patrons wait for   eagerly every year but the arrangements this year have left many disappointed.

  (65) said, "I come to mahotsava every year. But I am disappointed this year. The distance between entrance and parking was too much for a heart patient like me. It took me around 45 minutes just to park my vehicle."
 
 "Mismanagement has spoiled my mahotsava mood. I couldn't find the way to parking because of barricading on both ends of Avadh Shilpgram. I took   extension cricket stadium route and when we reached here, a constable made me take turn again from Shaheed Path to reach parking," said  .
 
 There was too much rush at ticket counters which are 500 metres apart, said visitors.
 
 People also complained about lack of proper public amenities and drinking water arrangements.
 
 Even food-lovers said that Mughlai dishes were missing at food court. "I am a non-veg lover but I couldn't find any other dish except for 'biryani'. I was told that Lucknow Mahotsava is a one pit stop for foodies," said  .
 
 "I had come for a four-day vacation from Delhi. I was feeling lucky that I got to visit mahotsava this time. But there are no food stalls from Akbari Gate. I feel like I am roaming somewhere outside Lucknow," said Kartikeya Swami.
 
 Sameera Shah, a doctor, said, "It took me one hour to reach the venue from Hazratganj. There was so much dust near the venue that we could barely see the route. I spent one hour sitting in my car because of the chaos due to haphazardly parked vehicles near the entrance."
