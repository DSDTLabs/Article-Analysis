LUCKNOW: A 28-year-old labourer was found dead at the railway crossing near   in   on Saturday evening. 

 Scores of people gathered to see the body with injuries on head. 
 
 Some passers-by alerted police. A team of cops reached the spot and took the body in custody. SHO Gomtinagar PK   said that the body was identified as that of one Harith, a labourer who had been missing from his home in   since Friday night. "It seems he was hit on the head with some heavy object," said Jha.
 
 The probe was delayed due to confusion between   and Gomtinagar police teams about the jurisdiction.
