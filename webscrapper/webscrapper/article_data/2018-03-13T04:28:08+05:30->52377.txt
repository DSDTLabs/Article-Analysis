NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday indicted the previous government in   led by Congress’s   for a Rs 1,500-crore land acquisition fraud, and reversed the scrapping of acquisition of 688 acres of land in  , done only to help builders.

 On August 27, 2004, when Hooda was CM, the state industries department had issued a notification about the government’s decision to acquire land in Gurugram, triggering distress sales to builders who promptly stepped in to offer rates higher than what the farmers would have got as compensation. Shortly afterwards, however, the notification was withdrawn, allowing builders to amass a fortune. They managed to acquire 400 acres for Rs 100 crore, when the market price was Rs 1,600 crore.
 
 The CBI has already chargesheeted Hooda in the case, and the SC order will strengthen the charge.
 
 The bench of Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and U U Lalit ordered that the 688 acres of land is now deemed to have been acquired by the   (HSIDC) and Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). The builders will get interest-free refund from the government at the rate at which they had purchased the land from the farmers, and the amount they had invested to develop the land.
