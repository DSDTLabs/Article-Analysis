RAJPIPLA: The   service launched by police on Friday last will prove to be a boon for people living in the hilly and forest areas of   district where ambulance services have invariably failed to reach during medical emergencies because of poor road connectivity.

 Narmada district superintendent of police   told TNN, “Two motorcycle ambulances have been deployed for providing service to people in the accident-prone zones. If they prove beneficial, 10 more two-wheeler ambulances will be added to the fleet by  . These ambulances will be run by police. Motorcycles are more convenient to provide medical assistance in Narmada district through which Narmada river flows and has hills and forests and over 516 villages. This kind of initiative has been launched for the first time in the country.”
 
 Forest cover of Narmada district is 45% of its area, and expectedly this place has poor mobile network. This initiative by the police will help tribal people, he added. 
 
 The two-wheeler ambulance is equipped with primary medical kit, global positioning system, a trained para medical person and a wireless set which is connected with police headquarters. An injured person has enough space to lie in comfort in the two-wheeler ambulance. 
 
 Pradipsinh Jadeja, home minister of the state, complimented Narmada police for this unique initiative.
