CHANDIGARH: Former minister and SAD spokesman   on Tuesday said   finance minister   should try to improve the efficiency of the state bureaucracy by learning to do official work in Punjabi.

 Grewal said it was baffling as to why the finance minister was trying to improve the English skills of civil officers by raising this issue at the concluding function of the World Punjabi Conference. “If the finance minister had raised the issue of improving Punjabi writing skills of civil officers, many of whom are from other states, it would have been understandable,” said Grewal. But, he added, the finance minister is questioning the English writing skills of officers, even though they have passed the requisite test for the same before being inducted into the civil services. “This raises questions on the selection process of the UPSC, which has selected them,” he added. 
 
 The SAD leader further added that the finance minister could also disclose the names of the two officers who fit the bill as per his standards of English and ask them to conduct courses for the larger fraternity. In case the finance minister was still not satisfied, he could himself take on the responsibility of teaching civil servants the art of writing memorandums by taking their classes or bringing in teachers from whom he had learnt to write memorandums, said Grewal.
