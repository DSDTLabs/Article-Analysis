Filmmaker   is known for critically-acclaimed movies like ' ' (2008) and ' ' (2011). In 2013, he stepped out of the comfort zone and dabbled in comedy with ' ', but the film failed to impress the audience. Now, he’s back with  , which is based on some of the most high-profile income tax raids conducted in the 80s. When BT caught up with the director, he talked about why he is drawn to real narratives. Excerpts…

 
 The first three films I directed were in quick succession, but Raid took some time to materialise. Out of the three films, 'Ghanchakkar' garnered the most extreme reactions. People either hated it or loved it, but when it plays on television, I get calls and people tell me it’s a good film. 'Ghanchakkar' not doing well at the box office didn’t deter me. 
 
 
 Nobody knows much about the IT raid episode that forms the crux of 'Raid'. In my films, I look for that one element that makes the story unbelievable. As the saying goes, truth is stranger than fiction and that’s what draws me to stories that are based on reality. When the IT raid was conducted in the 1980s, social media was non-existent and hence very little is known about the case. That gave me a chance to dig deep into the subject, because there was an element of mystery around it.
 
 
 Today, films don’t have characters that are starkly black or white. A narrative like that of Raid, lends itself to characters that are layered. I always try to explore various aspects of human beings and their lives.
 
 
 As a filmmaker, I want to do my job responsibly. Of course, we fear backlash; what if someone says something against it. When that happens, one feels sad and disheartened, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to give up. The attempt is to tell the story in the most responsible way possible and the idea is not to offend people.
