HYDERABAD: The state cabinet, at its meeting on Tuesday, is all set to approve a new act related to the  , which will do away with the existing law on the funding for  . 

 In place of the old law, a new “Sub-Plan Act” will come into force under which the funding will be made under the ‘Special Development Fund’. Besides, the allocations to these communities is to be done based on the population figures without linking it to the regular development programmes.
 
 After the cabinet approval, the bill will be placed before the   and the   for enactment. Sources in the government said a key change in the new law will carry forward the unspent funds that are allocated year after year. In the previous law, a 10-year time limit was fixed for the implementation, whereas the new law has not put any limit. Nodal agencies will decide the priority schemes and projects for the welfare of SC/ST communities and on the basis of their recommendations, the government will release funds.
 
 “Provisions have been made to effectively utilise the funds allocated for the target communities based on the proportion of their population in the state within the budget year,” deputy chief minister Kadiam Srihari, who headed the committee on SC/ST sub-plan, told TOI.
 
 As per the law, a state-level committee headed by the chief minister will take a call on the quantum of allocations every year. At the district level, collectors will head the committee and district MLAs and MPs will be its members. In this manner, the government will provide separate funds exclusively for SC/ST development through the SDF.
 
 That the TRS regime was keen on revamping the SC/ST sub-plan became clear after chief minister   held a meeting with SC/ST legislators in January this year and sought their suggestions on the new sub-plan. Recently, the AP government also rechristened its SC/ST sub-plan as sustainable and inclusive development fund.
