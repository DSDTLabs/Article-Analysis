NEW DELHI: India buried a 64-year-old ghost when  's 90-minute goal helped them beat   on Myanmarese soil.

 Udanta Singh's pass from inside the box was calmly converted by Chhetri to silence the 20,000-strong   crowd and start the   Asian Cup UAE 2019 qualifier round on a winning note.
 
 India last beat Myanmar (Burma then) on their soil in 1953 ­ a 4-2 win in the Quadrangular tournament. Led by Sailen Manna, Wimko Thanngaraj (2), Ahmed Khan and T Venkatesh were the scorers for India. In 1971, India suffered a 9-1 defeat at the hands of Burma in the Merdeka Cup in Kuala Lumpur ­ largely considered by many as the major point from where India's slide in international football began.
 
 On Tuesday, India began on a cautious note and opted to hold the ball more than the hosts. Myanmar, ranked 172 in the Fifa standings, on the other hand, started on a high note.
 
 Just after the 15-minute mark, India looked in trouble when Thein Than Win and Si Thu Aung combined well and built up a blistering attack from the left flank but the cross was cleared by debutant goalkeeper Edathodika.
 
 At the stroke of half-time, Chhetri was tack led hard inside the penalty box but the referee didn't pay any heed to Indian players' claims for a penalty.
 
 Then, in the 70th minute, against the run of the play, Udanta Singh outpaced the Myanmar defender and was brought down inside the box. Once again, the referee negated the penalty shout. Just as the game seemed headed for a draw, Udanta Singh, on a counter-attack, broke into from the right to unleash an inch-perfect pass which Chhetri made no mistake with.
 
 India host Kyrgyz Republic next on June 12, 2017 in their second match of the AFC Asian Cup Qualifying campaign before taking on Lebanon in an International Friendly on June 06, 2017.
