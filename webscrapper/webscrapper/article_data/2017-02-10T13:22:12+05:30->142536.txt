PONDA: Technogen, a Mumbai-based consultant company, has suggested three different routes over   for the new  . The proposal to provide an alternative to the existing 30-year-old beleaguered bridge is in the preliminary stage and the company has conducted a study of possible routes for the third link spanning about 7 km from   to Angadi, Loutolim, in Salcete.

 PWD assistant engineer Shashikant Desai said that the consultant had submitted three different route suggestions at three points over River Zuari between Loutolim and Borim.
 
 The PWD has already allotted a work permit for a feasibility report to Technogen. The entire project on National Highway 17 is estimated to cost Rs 500 crore, but while the consultancy firm will be given six months to submit the report, the actual land acquisition and other procedures may take a few years.
 
 This bridge will be the third link. The first bridge, built during the Portuguese era, was closed for traffic in the 1980s after it was destabilized following the collision of a barge with one of its piers. The second bridge had been commissioned in 1986, but developed problems within a few years and is periodically closed to test load capacity and for maintenance.
 
 The bridge serves as the only link between Ponda and Salcete talukas. Presently the Borim bridge experiences over 30,000 passenger car units (PCUs), wherein a motorcycle is half a PCU, a bus is three PCUs and a truck is four PCUs.
 
 Admitting the receipt of suggestions, PWD executive engineer   said that they have asked the consultant to prepare about seven different reports for the ease of finalizing the best route. 
 
  Though PWD officials tried to dispel apprehensions among the public about the stability of the existing Borim bridge, stating that it is being rehabilitated, commuters express concern over the work.
