SRINAGAR: As many as 95 Kashmiri youth have joined militancy during the last one year, raising to 200 the total strength of terrorists active in the valley, a senior police official said here today.

 "There are over 200 terrorists active in Kashmir. 95 youth have joined the militant ranks in the past year," Inspector General of Police (Kashmir) S J M Gillani told reporters here.
 
 He said while 110 militants are locals, rest of them are foreigners.
 
 Gillani said that some students were instigated by outside elements to pelt stones by luring them with money. He appealed to the parents to counsel them. 
 
 
 Speaking on the recent spate of bank robberies in South Kashmir, he said that investigation revealed terrorists of Laskar-e-Taiba&Hizbul Mujahideen were involved in the incidents.
 
 On the social media ban imposed by the government, Gillani said impact of the ban will be assessed at the end of the one-month period.
 
 "After the one-month period (is over), the ban on social media will be reviewed," he said.
 
 The state government imposed a ban on 22 websites and social media applications last month as it believed that these platforms were being misused by inimical elements to stoke trouble in Kashmir.
