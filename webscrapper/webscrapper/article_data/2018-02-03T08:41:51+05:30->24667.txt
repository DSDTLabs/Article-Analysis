LUDHIANA: The   has decided to defer e-way bill system for interstate and intrastate transactions indefinitely. The system for interstate deals was schedule to come into effect on February 1. 

 The board took the decision in the wake of crashing of its online e-way bill system which left thousands of trucks and other means of goods transportation stranded on Thursday. 
 
 The development has businessmen smiling. 
 
  chairman   said, “It comes as a huge relief for the trade and industry. The government must now understand that e-way bill system requires much tweaking and cannot be imposed on us like this. The system should not be implemented for intra-state transactions. But if the government wants to bring it in, then the exemption limit should be hiked to a minimum of Rs 1,00,000.”
 
  president Jagbir Singh Sokhi said, “Despite our repeated representations, the board ignored our warnings about the system. Its tall claims fell flat on the first day itself. They should have checked its feasibility before imposing it.” 
 
  president   said, “Its deferment comes as a huge relief. The government should first hike the exemption limit and then bring it into force. The present limit of Rs 50,000 is quite low.   number of traders using the facility must have put much load on the system servers that led to their crash.” 
 
 The board has been receiving much backlash from businessmen on its Twitter handle @AskGST_GoI since it tweeted that mandatory e-way bill has been deferred and is optional until new date of full launch is announced. 
 
 The development comes days after the   excise and taxation department deferred the the intrastate e-way bill by two months.
