RANCHI: Ranchiites filled the stadium to the brim but still failed to inspire the   to victory against   at Birsa Munda Astroturf Hockey Stadium on Saturday. Unlike their first home match against Kalinga Lancers, Rays failed to sound the board even once and the match ended in a goalless draw. Rays were poor inside the D and as their skipper Ashley Jackson pointed out after the match, they did not have a clear plan once they had the ball with them.

 However, one should not take away anything from the Delhi defenders. They were brilliant and one needs to make special mention of  , who led the junior team to victory in the World Cup recently . He stood there like a rock as Rays attacked again and again. Jackson, Trent Mitton, Manpreet Singh and Christopher Ruhr all gave off their best but failed to get past him. He was well supported by Iain Lewers, Manuel Brunet, Austin Smith and Rupinder Pal Singh himself.
 
 However, Waveriders will rue not converting the two penalty corners they got after failing to convert any of the seven against Lancers in their opening encounter. Rays will now hope to put on a better show against   on Wednesday while Delhi will travel to Mumbai.
 
 Both teams began on a cautious note but two minutes into the match, Talwinder Singh had a good chance to put Delhi Waveriders in the lead but his reverse shot from the edge of the D was saved by Rays goalkeeper Tyler Lovell.
 
 After that early chance, the action was less restricted to the midfield for the next five minutes. Rays finally broke the monotony when Mitton charged down the left flank into the D. However, he failed to get past the defenders.
