KAPURTHALA: Water is now visible in a substantial part of  . The place was covered with water hyacinth in the peak winter season, which led to a drastic fall in the population of migratory birds. Almost 90% of the wetland has been overrun by weeds. 

 Work on clearing the weeds was started by environmentalist Baba Balbir Singh   after he came across a report of the Asian water-bird census, which warned of its dwindling numbers. 
 
  
  
 
 Government officials and departments have talked about developing the wetland as a tourist destination but this has not been translated into action. Plans to construct a restaurant in the previous tenure of Capt   failed to take off. 
 
 Water hyacinth was cleared from the wetland earlier, but it was not done regularly, due to which the population of migratory birds nosedived. "More than half the stretch has been cleared and work was stalled as a boat being used in the project developed a snag. Work will continue for a few more days. The state government should ensure regular maintenance of the wetland," Seechewal said, adding that it would have to be ensured that water remained visible before migratory birds started flying into the region. Services of a number of volunteers, an excavator and a motorised boat were used to clear the weeds.
 
 Kanjhli wetland is one of the 26 Ramsar sites in India and the smallest wetland out of three Ramsar sites in Punjab. Around 50% decline in total population of the birds at the site was reported during the recent census. Only 110 birds were spotted against 232 seen last year. In the 2016 census, 263 birds were spotted. This year, only three birds of a long distance migratory bird species were spotted as compared to five species spotted last year.
