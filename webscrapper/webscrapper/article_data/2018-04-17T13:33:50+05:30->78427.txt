A Hindu priest in Hyderabad carried a Dalit devotee into  's sanctum sanctorum on Monday to propagate equality of human beings. 

 Chilkur Balaji Temple   carried Aditya Parasri, a devotee hailing from the Hindu Dalit community, amid Annamayya’s famous chant “Brahmam Okkate Parabrahmam Okkate”, floral decorations, naadaswaram music and Vedic hymns.
 
  
  
  
 
 “This is the re-enactment of a 2,700-year-old incident which was called Muni Vahana Seva’ that originated in Tamil Nadu. It is being done to re-establish the greatness of Sanatana Dharma and to propagate equality among all sections of the society,” said Mr Rangarajan, adding that many vested interests are trying to disturb the peace and harmony in the country.
 
 
 
 
 Giving a reason as to what prompted him to do the 'seva', Rangarajan said, “In January, I was part of a round-table conference in Osmania University, which discussed how backward caste communities are denied entry into the temple. 
 
 The discussion inspired him to re-enact the old tradition.
