HYDERABAD: Alleging diversion of water by  , the   engineer-in-chief (ENC) on Tuesday dashed off a complaint to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) in which he charged that   has diverted water from Srisailam without informing it or the KRMB.Describing this as a serious breach of the agreement between the two Telugu states, Telangana ENC C Muralidhar urged the   to convene an immediate meeting of the concerned parties to address the issue.

 Telangana contested that while the water level at Nagarjunasagar stands at a pathetic 500.9 feet against the 510 feet of minimum draw level, Srisailam has over 100 TMC feet of water. According to Telangana, AP is exploiting the situation to further delay releases to Nagarjunasagar by releasing water through Pothireddypadu head regulator.The backwaters of Srisailam are being diverted to give water to the Rayalaseema region even as Nagarjunasagar is still struggling to provide drinking water to Hyderabad and other Telangana districts.
 
 The ENC in his letter insisted that the water should be replenished on a priority basis at Nagarjunasagar.
 
 Telangana officials said, the TRS government is unhappy that the board has failed to persuade the AP government to release Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir to Nagarjunasagar to meet the drinking water needs of the state.â€œ When Telangana sent an SOS to the KRMB to direct AP to release water to Nagarjunasagar so that drinking water can reach Hyderabad, the board ordered the release of a meagre 2 TMC feet. Even as of Tuesday , Telangana officials were pleading with the AP government to release the water even as inflows into Srisailam reservoir increased leading to the water level rising up to 859 feet.
 
 To ensure the state does not suffer a similar fate next year, Telangana wants KRMB to decide the water plan for 2017-18 by taking the available water in Srisailam without any delay and to stop the diversion of water. The response of KMRB is still awaited.
