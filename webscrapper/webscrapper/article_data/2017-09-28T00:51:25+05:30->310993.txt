Fans were waiting eagerly for a major film studio to finally adapt ' ' and when   finally came out, it turned out to be a complete dud.

  Now, two months after release, King has commented on why the film failed to live up to the source material's standards, reports suggest.
 
  While giving an interview to a website, King said, "The major challenge was to do a film based on a series of books that's really long, about 3,000 pages."
 
  Adding, "The other part of it was the decision to do a PG-13 feature adaptation of books that are extremely violent and deal with violent behaviour in a fairly graphic way. That was something that had to be overcome."
 
  The acclaimed author also said that screenwriter   did "a terrific job in taking a central part of the book and turning it into what I thought was a pretty good movie."
 
  But he said the fans don't have to be disappointed as a TV adaptation of 'The Dark Tower' has been announced.
 
  Speaking about the series, King noted, "It would be like a complete reboot, so we'll just have to see."
 
  Meanwhile, the adaptation of King's another novel 'It' is breaking records at Box-Office and a sequel has already been given a release date.
