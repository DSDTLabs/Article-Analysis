NEW DELHI: Delhi government is planning to   green cover in the capital with the help of plantations in the ‘O’ zone of river  , which falls in the floodplain. On Monday, Delhi environment minister Imran Hussain wrote to   vice-chairman, asking   to draft a proposal for the government which could utilise the floodplain as a site for plantation of trees — thus reducing pollution in the capital.

 Hussain said the government in review meetings had been considering plantation of trees on the banks of Yamuna, which fall under the ‘O’ zone where activity is prohibited. The letter further says that increasing   in the capital was essential to tackle air pollution and the trees will also help in preventing soil erosion, if planted.
 
 Hussain added that the ‘O’ zone reportedly has a length of 23km on either side of the river and was under the control of DDA. “I feel that plantation on this zone will not only improve greenery in Delhi but will also help in soil conservation and prevention of encroachment,” Hussain said in the letter.
 
 The letter adds that the government had earlier approached DDA many times to make sites falling in the ‘O’ zone available for plantation. However, the government is yet to receive a concrete proposal from DDA on this matter.
