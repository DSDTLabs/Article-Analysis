With less than a week to go for the XXI Commenwealth Games to kick-off in Australia, all eyes are on Hyderabadi shuttler   who is tipped to be one of the favourites to win a medal for the country. The 22-year-old knows that nothing less than a podium finish will satisfy the 
legions of fans back home who are rooting for her. “There’s a week to go for the event and the preparations are on in full swing. I’m extremely grateful to my fans for their support and for cheering me on throughout and I’ll take this strength with me to the  ,” said Sindhu on the sidelines of a charity event. 
 The ace shuttler, who lost a nail-biting encounter with Japan’s   in the semi-final of the All England Championship vows to bounce back hard in the upcoming Commonwealth Games. “Obviously, it was disappointing to lose but I gave it a 100 per cent and it was a close contest, so no regrets there. I will now try and come back stronger this time,” Sindhu expressed. 
 Sindhu, who recently had an injury scare, brushed it off as a minor sprain and said it hasn’t hampered her preparations for the event. “This event comes once in four years, so it’s a big thing and I want to give it my best shot. I’ve trained hard for it and I’m raring to go,” she said.
 Currently ranked third in the   ratings for Women’s singles, Sindhu, who won a bronze medal in the last edition of the Commonwealth Games, is hoping to make history once again. “It’s a prestigious event and I’m one of the flagbearers so it’s truly a proud moment to be representing the country at this level,” she adds with a smile. 
 Well, we hope she can keep the flag flying high for India at the Commonwealth Games, which start on April 5.
