PANAJI: With none of their long-term aspirations for a playground and other amenities finding place in the   manifestos, some villagers are contemplating using the   (NOTA) button on February 4.

 The government had realized the requirement for a playground 35 years ago. Then-chief minister Pratapsingh Rane had laid a foundation stone for it behind the Chimbel panchayat. “We voted and elected six MLAs. After 35 years, we can still see the foundation stone but no playground,” Tukaram Kunkalker, secretary,  , said.
 
 Villagers have also been petitioning authorities at various levels for a school and community hall, too. After perusing manifestos of the candidates, they have realized that these demands are not included. “This shows that these pending demands will be never fulfilled,” Kunkalker said.
 
 The village school,  , is being run on temporary-basis for more than 40 years in the Chimbel panchayat premises. “Huge parcels of land are easily available for private projects, multi-dwelling units and complexes in Chimbel, but there is no land for a school building and community hall,” he said.
 
 Chimbel Manch, the local NGO, is planning to canvas and urge people to opt for NOTA. “We will mobilise the voters, but if the parties assure us of redressing our grievances, we may change our mind,” Gurudas Shirodkar, vice-president of Chimbel Manch, said.
