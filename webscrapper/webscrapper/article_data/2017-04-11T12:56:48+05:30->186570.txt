They also asked him to take action against the unauthorized food vendors’ lobby. “These food vendors sell unhygienic food. Even when there is Janta Khana of IRCTC is available, the unscrupulous vendors are doing a brisk business,” said Tripathi.
 
 Banerjee was asked to look into the complaints about behaviour of rail employees. “Passengers even complained to us that the employees are rude to them. At ticket windows, they refuse to give them change and are pushed away if passengers argue,” said Tripathi. He said that the private contractors are paid lakhs of rupees per month yet they do not employ necessary number of workers. He alleged that against the required number of 70, only seven workers are currently working in a shift.
 
  (RPF) also got a earful from the committee. Some female passengers complained that RPF constables remain mute spectators on the platform despite seeing some male passengers staring and even pushing them. “We had expected a lot from Vadodara railway station but we are highly disappointed,” Tripathi told TOI.
