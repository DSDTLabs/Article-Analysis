Looks like the travel bug has bitten  . The actress has been globe-trotting over the last few weeks. After enjoying the spring in London with her children Samaira and Kiaan Raj and sister 
 , Karisma has now headed to the scenic locales of Italy. The 42-year-old actress took to   to share few pictures of her vacay and they are bound to make you jealous!
 
 One of the pictures sees Karisma, looking smart in a grey sweater, pair of denims and a leather jacket, taking in the serenity of her surroundings as the majestic mountains serve as the perfect backdrop. Her travel diaries also see her exploring the country as she takes a walk down the cobbled streets of Italy. And yes, while on holiday, the ‘Fiza’ actress has also ditched her diet – she has posted a picture that sees her gorging on a gelato and she has aptly captioned the picture, “#wheninitaly #eat #gelato #italiandiaries.” Don’t these pictures make you want to head out on that long-overdue vacay pronto?
