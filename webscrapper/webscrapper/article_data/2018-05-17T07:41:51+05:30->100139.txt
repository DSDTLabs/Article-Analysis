As access to feeder services is crucial in ensuring last-mile connectivity for commuters, Kochi   authorities have been working aggressively towards this. But responses from commuters received by TOI show that lack of adequate feeder services and difficulty in accessing Metro stations from interior regions of the city acts as a major deterrent for potential Metro users.

 “Kochi Metro should make sure that all feeder services including KSRTC buses stop at Metro stations,” said  , a regular Metro passenger. Citizens also insisted on extending   network to other places like Fort Kochi, Angamaly and Cial to improve connectivity.
 
 Readers also highlighted the need to provide feeder services from   Metro station to Aluva railway station and town KSRTC bus stand. They also pointed out the need to introduce similar feeder service connectivity between Maharajas Ground Metro station and transit spots like   South Railway Station, Vyttila hub and the Ernakulam KSRTC bus stand.
 
 Regular commuters also have issues with the Kochi 1 card, the prepaid smartcard introduced by KMRL.
