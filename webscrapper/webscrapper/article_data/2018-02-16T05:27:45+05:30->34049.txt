Playwright   says he was a little grumpy after being snubbed for Best Director at this year's   but is happy his friends have all been nominated.

 "It was a funny morning because we got, I think, more than we ever expected to because  , my lovely editor, got nominated.   for his fantastic score, Woody (Harrelson) got nominated and we weren't 100 per cent sure he would get in," McDonagh told deadline.com.
 
 He added: "We assumed Sam (Rockwell) and Francis (McDormand) would and even for Best Picture too so we got way more, my friends got way more attention.
 
 "And I was have a jog, a little grumperly, along the east river in New York thinking 'director, didn't get that' but my friends all did and we will all go together so that's a lovely thing."
 
 McDonagh thought his movie could have "easily slipped in and out as another indie film" due its dark subject matter.
