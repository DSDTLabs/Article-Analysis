NEW DELHI: With Haryana again reducing the raw water supply to Delhi through the  , many areas in the capital received water at low pressure on Tuesday. Although the situation isn’t yet a full-blown crisis even if the pond level at Wazirabad was 3.5 ft below the normal level, Delhi Jal Board intends to raise the matter in the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

 
 “Haryana had assured water supply as per their obligation till May 15, but there is fluctuation in the water supply and we are unable to meet the city’s requirements,” said Dinesh Mohaniya, Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman and MLA from  . “We hope the Supreme Court intervenes in the matter.”
 
 A   official said areas facing water problems on Wednesday and possibly more days include Moolchand, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Lodhi Road and Nizamuddin in south Delhi; India Gate, Connaught Place, Khan Market, Golf Links, Jor Bagh, Lodhi Colony, Pandara Road, Bapa Nagar, Tilak Marg, Pragati Maidan under NDMC; and Ramlila Ground, Subhash Park, Daryaganj, Walled City localities, Chandni Chowk, Jama Masjid and ITO in north and central Delhi.
 
 TOI received several complaints about low   on Tuesday. Ranjan Singh of Shalimar Bagh said owners of flats on the higher floors had to summon water tankers. “But how much water can we keep carrying up to our homes?” Singh said. 
 
 The water treatment plants at Wazirabad and Chandrawal have been affected and raw water is being diverted from the other plants to meet the shortfall at these two centres. The functioning of the plants at Haiderpur, Dwarka, Nangloi, Bawana and Okhla has also been impacted.
 
 Water has been a niggling problem this year. In January and February, the city received raw water with high ammonia content from Haryana, while the flow itself ebbed from the third month.
