New Delhi: There is confusion among parents on whether they are supposed to fill forms again for some schools that have included new criteria, or be evaluated on the basis of old forms, with several schools choosing to stick to government criteria alone. 

 Many have also complained about the lack of clarity from the schools on their plans ahead. Though some schools have invited parents to fill forms all over again, there are several queries on admissionsnursery.com by them seeking clarification. 
 
 An interim verdict by high court on January 13 allowed schools to include their own set of approved criteria in the admission form, along with the one prescribed by the government on the basis of distance. The court is to scrutinise the filled forms and decided on what basis admissions must be made, following a hearing on January 19. 
 
 The decision has hassled parents who now have to do double the work, knowing that the trial on January 19 can go either way. They have also reported schools that have only used their own criteria in the forms. According to the information displayed on the website of a school, the neighbourhood criteria has been manipulated to grant more points to those within 8km and less to those beyond it. While it can be taken as the school’s version of its admission criteria, the website makes no mention of the four distance brackets prescribed by the   (DoE) in its guidelines. 
 
 According to Kamal Gupta, the petitioner for private schools on public land that had approached the court against the DoE criteria, this is wrong. “Schools have been directed to use both government and own criteria in the admission form. They cannot just post their own criteria and ignore the one stipulated by the government,” he said. 
 
 Gupta added that schools also must bring out new forms in case they want to start the admission according to new verdict, or can choose to stick to the DoE guidelines and grant admission solely on its basis.
