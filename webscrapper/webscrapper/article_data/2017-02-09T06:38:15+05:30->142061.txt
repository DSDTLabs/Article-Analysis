HYDERABAD: Two weeks after 44-year-old   Mallesham Chinthakindi was conferred with the  , the   has decided to massively subsidise his innovation to enable   to buy the Laxmi Asu machine.

 The central subsidy , which is to be announced shortly under the `Hathkar Ka Samadhan Sahayata Yojna', is expected to meet a lion's share of the machine's cost of Rs 25,000. The subsidy will be given to handloom weavers, especially from the Padmashali community , under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode. “There is no limit on the number of beneficiaries who can claim the subsidy , to get the machine“ said a senior official representing a ministry-funded centre in the city.
 
 Ironically, Mallesham had failed to get subsidy from the Telangana government despite several representations as well as a showcase of the effortreducing machine before textiles minister K T Rama Rao.
 
 Lack of help and a desire to help poor weavers had made Mallesham opt for two rounds of crowdfunding via http:www.fueladream.com. “I went for the second round of crowdfunding as I wanted to help more wea vers. My target is to reach 600 more families. After the first round, I raised Rs 4 lakh. I have decided to help 28 weaver families in Bachhanapet mandal in Jangaon district. They will be given the machine at 50% subsidy,“ Mallesham said.
 
 As the machines are costly , he has only managed to sell about 850 units so far. With the second round of crowdfunding, he hopes to raise Rs 1.7 lakh to help 10 more families.
 
 The Centre's decision is expected to come as a boon to several more weaver families in Nalgonda, Warangal and Ranga Reddy districts producing the intricate Geographical Indication (GI) protected Pochampally Ikat sarees.
 
 “We installed 19 Laxmi Asu machines at Pochampally Handloom Park in 2008 and 320 artisans are using them,“ said Damoder Seetha, one of the directors of the park that was set up on 25 acres on the Vijayawada highway .
