BENGALURU: Traffic police in the city have moved rapidly to put safety front and centre for motorists, first by cracking down on halfhelmets, then by insisting children too wear helmets and now by announcing that it will penalize motorists wearing helmets without the ISI mark, a benchmark set by the Bureau of Indian Standards ( ), from February 1. The police though have moved so quickly that they have got themselves all tangled up.

 Only last week, the Bengaluru traffic police replied to a tweet saying people can use helmets that meet global standards set by agencies like the the United States’ DoT (department of transportation) and Europe’s   (  for Europe). These helmets are of superior quality to ISImarked helmets. However, R  , additional commissioner of police (traffic), told TOI: “We will not accept such helmets. We will only accept those with an ISI mark. Somebody operating the Twitter handle has erred. I’ll order the post to be removed.”
 
 This means a rider of a luxury bike such as a   or a  , who wears a helmet costing upwards of Rs 15,000, will now have to sport an ISI-marked helmet.
 
 
  
  
 
 The conflicting messages over the legality of helmets approved by foreign agencies has left professional riders and traders worried. Professional motorcyclist  , who is also associated with Motorcycle Travellers Meet (MTM), a forum for adventure motorcyclists, said: “It’s ridiculous. This law came into being to ensure people wear good-quality helmets and to ensure substandard ones are done away with. Now, if they are not going to allow the best and simply insist on only those with an ISI mark, it defeats the whole purpose.”
 
 Traders claim the sale of helmets that meet global standards has been increasing over the past six years thanks to increasing awareness on safety and the advent of luxury bikes. They argue that enforcing agencies must uphold the spirit of law and not blindly impose rules on people.
