The most awaited tv reality show, 'Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu' season 4 is back with a bang. While the previous seasons were hosted by Akkineni Nagarjuna, the fresh season, makers of the show had roped in megastar Chiranjeevi to grace the hot seat as a host. Chiranjeevi, who has kick started his second innings with 'Khaidi No 150' is all bucked up about his new role on small screen. This is the first time that the veteran is donning the role of a television host. The episodes of the new season are set to go on air from February 13 at 9.30 pm only on Maa Tv.
