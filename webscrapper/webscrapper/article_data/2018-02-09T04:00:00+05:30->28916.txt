Rajkot: About 40 lakh pilgrims are expected to visit a five-day extravaganza of Mahashivaratri fair which will begin at Bhavnath Mahadev Temple in the valley of Girnar in Junagadh from Friday. 

 Junagadh district administration has deployed 100 mini buses for the pilgrims going to the fair. “A total of 22 CCTV cameras have been installed and 900 police personnel deployed to maintain security at the fair. Five 108 emergency ambulances have been deputed at the fair to meet any eventuality,” said an official from Junagadh district administration. 
 
 The 108 emergency service has launched a mobile application to locate the place at the event to avoid stampede or other mishap during the fair. On the concluding day, February 13, chief minister Vijay Rupani is likely to be present. tnn
