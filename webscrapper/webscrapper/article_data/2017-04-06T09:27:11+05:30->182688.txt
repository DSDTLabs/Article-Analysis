 The PCB recently announced that it has written to the PMC, and its special purpose vehicle for the   programme, the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL), to find out the areas it can cooperate for the pan Pune projects.
 
 These are projects besides the core 1000 acre land encompassing Aundh-Baner-Balewadi that is selected for area development initiative of the Smart City plans being drafted by the PSCDCL.
 
 “We have written to the PMC to find out the areas of the pan-city Smart City projects that we can work jointly, particularly when the Centre has also nominated the Pune Cantonment as part of the Smart Cantonment project. This can be in regards to traffic management or PMPML buses which pass through Pune Cantonment. We are also looking at water supply and drainage systems, both of which need an overhaul in parts,” said DN Yadav, the chief executive officer of the PCB. “Water supply to the Cantonment is also the PMC’s responsibility. The pipelines have not been changed for many years, and are being corroded. So that is also an area we will be looking into for their cooperation, under Smart City or other plans,” he added.
