KOZHIKODE: With the recent government decision to reopen the closed bars and liquor vends along highways in panchayat areas coming under criticism, excise minister T P Ramakrishnan has said that he was ready to hold talks with the   and other disgruntled groups on the issue.

 Addressing a news conference here on Sunday, Ramakrishnan said the propaganda that   government was planning to allow free flow of liquor in the state under the cover of the Supreme Court order was baseless.
 
 “There seems to be some misunderstanding. I am not dismissing the concerns raised by the Church. If the Church is ready for talks, then I am ready for discussions with them and anyone else to allay their concerns,” Ramakrishnan added.
 
 The   ( ) had on Saturday warned that the LDF government will have to pay a heavy price if it went ahead with the controversial decision.
 
 The Supreme Court had last month granted the state governments the discretion to decide on whether to allow sale of liquor along national and state highways in areas that come under panchayat local self-government bodies. Following the order, the government had recently decided to reopen the closed outlets in panchayats with a population of 10,000 and above.
 
 “We will not allow the opening of new liquor outlets under the cover of the   order. The government order is applicable to only those outlets which were closed down following the SC order in December 2016. Three bar hotels, 171 beer and wine parlours, six retail liquor outlets, one club, three military canteens and 499 toddy shops could be reopened now,” the minister said.
