Actress   says she is 'very proud' of her family as well as the way her career has shaped up. 

 The 'Making History' actress doesn't talk about her daughter  , 19 months, or husband   very much because she would rather focus on her work without people's perceptions getting in the way. 
 
  
  
 "I don't talk about Arlo very much. I am very proud of that area of my life. But I'm also really proud of the show, and of the work I do. I think the perception is: you're an ingenue, or you're an icon, or you're a mom. There's no in between." she said
