New Delhi: A 26-year-old woman, who was preparing for the civil services exams, allegedly committed suicide by hanging from a ceiling fan at her rented flat in northwest Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar on Thursday morning. 

 A one-page suicide note found on her study table stated that no one was to be blamed for her death, said the police. Deveshwari Devangan stayed in the flat with two more women for the past four months. She had cleared the   preliminary examination on her first attempt but couldn’t clear the mains, police said.
 
 On Thursday morning, one of the flatmates informed the police about the death. When Deveshwari neither joined her flatmates for breakfast nor took their phone calls, one of them peeped into her room that was locked from inside and found her hanging from the ceiling fan. 
 
 Cops broke open the door and took her to hospital where doctors declared her brought dead.
