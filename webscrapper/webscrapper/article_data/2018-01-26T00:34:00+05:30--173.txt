Tirupur: Farmers from Udumalpet, who attended the grievance day meet conducted at the district collectorate on Thursday, demanded the public works department to release one thousand million cubic feet (tmc) water to the seven tank irrigation scheme in the region.

 The scheme covers seven tanks — Thinaikulam, Karisalkulam, Sengulam, Periyakulam, Ammapattikulam, Ottukulam, and Valaiyankulam in Thali and surrounding villages in Udumalpet taluk. Under the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP), water is released from Thirumurthy Reservoir for irrigating 3,500 acres of land, which depend on the seven tanks. Though a decent rainfall was recorded this year, the PWD decided to release only half of the 1tmc water, the farmers said. The quantum of water will not be sufficient for irrigation, the farmers told collector KS Palanisamy who attended the grievance day meet.
 
 “Most farmers in the region cultivate sugarcane, which requires abundant water. If sufficient water is not released, the cultivation will be affected badly,” said Venkata Ramini, a farmer.
 
 The farmers wanted PWD to release 450 million cubic feet litres of water allotted for the seven tanks regions immediately, before releasing the rest of the water. However, PWD officials said with the available quantum of water in Thirumurthy Reservoir and other main dams, it will not be easy to releaseso much water . 
 
 The collector will conduct a special meeting to sort out the issue.
