MUMBAI: A lot of talk in the lead up to the World Cup had revolved around whether or not wonder-boy and   sensation   would be included in the   squad.

 Vinicius, who has signed a 45 million euro transfer deal with European giants Real Madrid, that becomes effective from July 2018 when he turns 18, was finally included in Brazil's 21-man squad for the tournament.
 
 While Brazil are scheduled to play their Group D matches in Kochi, TOI can confirm that the three-time champions will train at the Mumbai Football Arena from September 26-October 2. They will play two warmup matches, one against   on September 28 and another against a local side on two days later. The entry for the matches will be free of cost.
 
 If that's not enough, TOI can further reveal that England too will be training in Mumbai and will play a practice match against New Zealand on October 1. England are placed in Group F and will play their matches in Kolkata.
 
 The Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA) will be hosting the teams, which includes arranging their war m-up matches and training sessions. MDFA president Aaditya Thackeray was instrumental in getting the teams to play in the city, and said it's a huge honour for Mumbai to host the teams.
 
 “The fact that these teams chose Mumbai over all other locations in the country speaks volumes about the facilities we're offering. Having a player like Vinicius play here is an amazing opportunity for the f ans.
 
 Three world-class teams are playing here and we' re not charging any entry fee. Hope people come in large numbers,” Thackeray said on Wednesday.
