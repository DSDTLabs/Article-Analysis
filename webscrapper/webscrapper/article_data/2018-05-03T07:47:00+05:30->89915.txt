Ambala: Of the 1.2 lakh people receiving benefits from the state government in Ambala district, 519 are yet to submit details of their   card to the social welfare department, failing to meet the April 30 deadline for filing this information.

 The 519 pensioners have not received any benefits since September last year. District social welfare officer Surjeet Kaur said there were around 7,400 such cases in Ambala district at the start, but most of them had been sorted out in the past eight months. “The details of some had mismatched, while others did not update us with their Aadhaar numbers,” she said.
 
 She said if any one of the beneficiaries approached them for linking Aadhaar, they would accept the case. “But the state department will give the final approval,” she said. “So far, the government has not issued any orders to extend the date for linking Aadhaar.”
 
 Surjeet said many pensioners in the 519 could have already died and that was why nobody came forward to furnish the information. “Our teams are working to check the exact number of death cases,” she said. “Before the April 30 deadline, we could have updated the information. But now only the state government has these powers.”
