Singer   has bought a home in   because he loved its vineyard. 

 The "Shape of You" singer revealed that he has splashed out on a property in Umbria, which was struck by a 6.6 magnitude   when he was visiting last year. 
 
  
  
 "I didn't want to buy in Tuscany because there are too many English people there. There is a vineyard and the moment I saw it I knew I had to buy that  . 
 
 "It's in Umbria. When the earthquake happened, I was there and I felt it, but I'm not that close to where it happened," Sheeran says.
