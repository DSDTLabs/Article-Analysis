Coimbatore: Owning a ferocious dog could mean a threat to the master’s life, a 37-year-old man learned the hard way on Wednesday. B Gunasekaran, a farmer at S Malaiyantipattinam near Pollachi, was the not-so-proud owner of a male German shepherd that barked at everything that moved. The dog particularly held a grudge against his neighbour Chinnu alias Nataraj, a labourer, for reasons unknown. On Tuesday evening, when Nataraj passed Gunasekaran’s house, the dog began to bark at him. An irritated Nataraj grabbed a stick and beat up the dog severely. According to some sources, he also abused Gunasekaran’s mother using foul language. On Wednesday, when Gunasekaran and his wife went to the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP) canal for washing clothes, the dog tagged along. There it spotted Nataraj, who was heavily drunk. The angry animal pounced on him and tried to bite him. But, Nataraj managed to ward it off using a stick. Meanwhile, a quarrel broke out between Gunasekaran and Nataraj. In a fit of rage, Nataraj flashed a knife and threatened Gunasekaran with dire consequences. He then stabbed Gunasekaran on the chest. The inured man was rushed to a private hospital in Pollachi, where he is undergoing treatment. Based on his complaint, Gomangalam police registered a case against Nataraj under Section 294 (b), 324 and 506 (ii) of the Indian Penal Code.  Sub-inspector Kuppusamy, who is investigating the case, said that Nataraj is absconding.
