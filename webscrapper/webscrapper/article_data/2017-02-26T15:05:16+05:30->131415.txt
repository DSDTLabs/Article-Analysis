  While Ram Charan will be bankrolling this venture, reports suggest that  , who delivered the hit film ‘Dhruva’ in December last year will be directing the film. Moreover, it is reported that Ram will have a more prominent role in this film, unlike his cameo in ‘Khaidi No 150’.
  
  As for the genre of the film, the makers have narrowed down on two scripts which they will finalise soon. It had been reported that one script that made the cut, revolved around the story of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy - one of the first freedom fighters in India.
