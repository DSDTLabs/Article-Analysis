KOCHI: The   has quashed a police case registered against a man for sending   to a 17-year-old boy as it invoked a penal provision applicable only to women victims. 

 A single bench quashed the case registered by Pathanamthitta police against Pramod Yesodharan of Agasthyacode near Anchal in Kollam on his petition (Crl MC No. 1536/2017). The case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the minor's father that Pramod had been sending obscene messages and pictures to his son through Facebook.
 
 Police had filed a final report after investigation, accusing Pramod of the offence under section 509 of Indian Penal Code that deals with word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman, which is punishable with imprisonment up to one year. "In order to attract the offence under Section 509 IPC, the victim must be a female. Therefore, if the person against whom the act is committed is not a female, the offence under Section 509 IPC will not be attracted," the judgment said.
