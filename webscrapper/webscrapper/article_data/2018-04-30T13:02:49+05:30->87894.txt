The energy of students and and the potential of our youths will take UP ahead,” he said. The government had adopted tough anti-copying measures this time.
 
 The CM said that his government had brought welfare schemes for every section of society, including farmers, women, youths, poor and students.
 
 “Earlier a large section of SC/ST students was deprived of scholarship, but today over 23 lakhs students belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are getting scholarship. Our government is also coming up with a scheme of residential schools for children of poor families.” CM said that the state government is ensuring that the benefits of Central schemes are reaching the people.
