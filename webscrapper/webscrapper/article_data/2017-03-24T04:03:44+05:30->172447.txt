NEW DELHI: A Delhi   on Thursday directed the Delhi Police’s Anti-Corruption Branch to file a report on its probe into alleged irregularities in PWD work against Delhi CM Arvind   by April 20.

 “It is clear that due to the indecisiveness of the Delhi police, the filing of action taken report has been delayed,” said metropolitan magistrate Abhilash Malhotra. 
 
 The court directed senior police officials to ensure that no further delay is caused in filing of the report. “The ACP is directed to look into the matter and ensure that no further delay is caused in filing of the action taken report. The report is to be filed positively on or before the next date of hearing,” noted the court.
 
 The court was hearing a criminal complaint filed against Kejriwal, his brother-in-law Surender Kumar Bansal, and a Public Works Department officer on charges of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. The complainants accused them of cheating and defrauding the treasury to the tune of over Rs 10 crore. TNN
