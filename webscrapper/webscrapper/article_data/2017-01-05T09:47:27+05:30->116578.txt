 Such incidents happening in a secure city like Bengaluru, where more cultured people live, is unfortunate. I strongly condemn such incidents.More than women , men should behave responsibly.It's our responsibility to protect our sisters and mothers.Such incidents definitely are not good for the image of our city. But I believe people have faith in the state administration, and we are confident of addressing any such concer ns during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
 
 
 
 
 Home minister G Parameshwara has already clarified that he has been misconstrued.Now, those who misconstrued his statement should take their words back.
