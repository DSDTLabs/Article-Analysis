But UP has seen through his lies.”
 
 The Congress vice president, who has been addressing three rallies a day in UP and carrying out a sustained attack on the PM and the  , also said that the SP and Congress had concrete development plans for UP’s youth and farm community that involved giving out soft loans to the youth and better prices for farm produce.
