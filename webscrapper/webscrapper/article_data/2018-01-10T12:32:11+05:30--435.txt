AJMER:   candidate   filed his nomination for   state assembly by-elections in the presence of senior Congress leaders on Tuesday. In a show of strength, former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, AICC general secretary C P Joshi and PCC chief  , along with  's AICC general secretary in-charge Avinash Pande, shared the platform to send across a message that Congress state unit was united. 

 BJP candidate Shiv Singh Hada will file his nomination on Wednesday.
 
 With a large gathering in Mandalgarh, Congress gave the message that the party is prepared to fight BJP. PCC chief Sachin Pilot said that people of Rajasthan are suffering because of the policies of Raje government and, therefore, with this by-election they want to give the message that enough is enough.
 
 41-year-old Dhakar was born in Manji Saheb ka Khera village and is in politics since nine years. He is a law graduate and in 2013 too, he was Congress candidate in state assembly elections but lost to late BJP MLA Kirti Kumari by 18,540 votes. Vivek is banking on 30,000 Dhakar votes in Mandalgarh and also has the support of large number of Dalits in the region. Mandalgarh is traditionally a Congress seat but last time BJP won the seat with huge votes. Now, Congress is trying to get back the seat. BJP candidate WShakti Singh Hada is the zila pramukh at present and has the support of around 20,000 Rajput voters in the constituency and also local support of zila parishad members and sarpanchs. BJP will play the sympathy card in this by-election and try to retain this seat.
