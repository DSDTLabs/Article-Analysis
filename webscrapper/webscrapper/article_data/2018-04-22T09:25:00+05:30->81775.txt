PANCHKULA: The police have recovered the body of a 38-year-old man from   near   on Saturday.

 Police believe that the deceased, who has been identified as Rakesh Bansal, died due to drowning in the river on Saturday.
 
 Chandimandir police sub-inspector   told TOI, “We have not ruled out foul play in the death, but prima facia it seems to be a case of death due to drowning. There is an injury mark on the deceased’s right eyebrow. Further analysis will be carried out after we obtain the autopsy report.”
 
 However, Rakesh’s family members suspect murder. His father Suhsil Bansal said that Rakesh had left from home around 8am and didn’t take his cellphone and wallet with him. He had told his father that he would be back in a few hours. He, however, didn’t.
 
 Some farmers working in their fields spotted a body floating on the water. Morni police post incharge sub-inspector Mangay Ram said that the man probably went to take a swim in the river while he must have slipped, got hurt and drowned. His clothes, slippers and a bottle of cold drink were found near the spot.
 
 Rakesh was unmarried and used to help his father at his cycle repair shop.
 
 His body has been kept in the mortuary of civil hospital Sector 6, Panchkula.
