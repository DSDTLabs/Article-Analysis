NAGPUR: Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N   squandered a golden opportunity to script history as they lost their mixed doubles semifinal in the   Super Series   tournament in Tokyo on Saturday. Qualifiers Takuro Hoki and Sayaka Hirota defeated them 14-21, 21-15, 21-19.

 V Diju and Jwala Gutta was the only Indian pair to reach the final of Super Series earlier. They had made it to the summit clash of 2009 Super Series Masters and the semis of the 2011 China Open Super Series. Chopra and Sikki, winners of three Grand Prix mixed doubles titles in 2016, looked in good touch and wrapped up the first game effortlessly. However, the world No.146 Japanese pair bounced back strongly and levelled the game-score 1-1 with an inspired display of power and accuracy.
 
 The world No. 19 pair of Chopra and Reddy put up a brave fight in the decider and was on the verge of making a historic entry to their maiden Super Series mixed doubles final. The Japanese will now take on   and Huang Dongping of China in the final. Sikki and Chopra were disappointed. 
 
 “We had an ideal start but could not pull out win despite our valiant efforts. We were in contention till the end. We saved one match point but that wasn’t enough,” Chopra told TOI. 
 
 Viktor Axelsen will face   in the men’s singles final, while Olympic champion Carolina Marin will battle it out against China’s He Bingjiao for the women’s title.
