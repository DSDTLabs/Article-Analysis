Karur: A class XII student attempted suicide by consuming a poisonous seed alleging that he was beaten by his headmaster near Uppidamangalam in Karur district on Thursday. The student was rushed to a private hospital in Puliyur, where he was treated and is currently out of danger, police said.

 The Uppidamangalam government higher secondary school student was allegedly beaten by his headmaster after he was found loitering around the campus instead of studying in the class for upcoming board examination. Allegedly his mother had also been scolding him for the past few days as he was said to be in love with a girl. 
 
 The student, who hailed from Jothivadam, had also reportedly written a letter in which he only blamed the headmaster for his decision. District chief education officer Ganesh Moorthy visited the student at the hospital. Further investigations are on.
