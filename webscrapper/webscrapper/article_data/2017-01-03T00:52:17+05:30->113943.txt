CHENNAI: The fog in Delhi, which has delayed train by more than 10 hours, has led to a spike in demand for flight tickets on the Chennai-Delhi route. A one-way ticket, booked two days in advance, is now in the Rs 8,000-Rs 20,000 range. It used to cost Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000.

 Fares are particularly high on morning flights on Tuesday and Wednesday. A one-way economy class ticket for Tuesday costs Rs 8,400-Rs Rs21,000, and Rs 8,423-Rs 10,200 for Wednesday. Fares are Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 for Thursday.
 
 Sources say those who have booked train tickets and cannoy put off their journeys are switching to flights, pushing up the demand.
 
 Railways has been rescheduling train services to Delhi on a day to day basis because the pairing trains are getting delayed. On Monday, the Chennai Central-Hazrat Nizamuddin Duronto express was delayed by 15 hours and departed only at 10pm.
 
 An official of an online ticketing portal said the fares are likely to go up further with just one or two seats left in the Rs 8,000-Rs 8,500 slabs.
 
 The best option will be to take flights reaching Delhi after midnight. Tickets on flights leaving Chennai after 10.30pm are in the Rs 3,000-Rs 3,500 range.
 
  of   said air fares on the route were in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 on a usual day. “The increase is because of the demand created by unreliable train services. Those who want to prefer emergency trips take the flight. The fares are not as high as they are during festivals when demand peaks,” he said
 
 Many airlines have started using wide-body aircraft on the Chennai-Delhi and the Chennai-Mumbai routes so that the demand for seats will not trigger an unusual increase in fares.
