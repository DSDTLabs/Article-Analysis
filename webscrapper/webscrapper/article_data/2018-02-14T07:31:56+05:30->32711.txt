LUCKNOW:  's   committee that investigated the allegations of   students about being ragged by seniors on February 4 found the juniors guilty of lodging a false complaint. 

 After the cell submitted its report on Tuesday, the university imposed a fine of 25% of the total fee on all the students involved and also barred them from hostel.
 
 BBA students accepted in writing that they had lodged a false complaint when seniors misbehaved with them after a cricket match. Following their written confession, the university also wrote to the   (UGC) about the false complaint. 
 
 "The committee found that the students had lodged a false complaint against their seniors. LU has also written to UGC, apologizing and informing it of the false complaint lodged by the students," said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh sharing the committee report.
 
 He said the committee interrogated 11 BBA students who had accused seniors of   and 11 MBA students who had lodged a cross-complaint against the juniors for pestering and threatening them.
 
 The committee found that the altercation began between the MBA and BBA students after a cricket match when after being defeated by the juniors, seniors had a verbal spat with them which led to a scuffle. Reacting to their misbehaviour, juniors lodged a false ragging complaint, he added.
 
 The V-C said as both the BBA and MBA students had disrupted the law and order of the university, they all were fined 25% of the total annual fee. They have also been directed to give an affidavit promising that they will not resort to any such activities in the future that may tarnish the university's image, he added.
 
 He also said the students had been served a warning that if they failed to follow the university's directions, they would not be allowed to continue their course. The students will also not be able to avail hostel facility till their course is completed.
