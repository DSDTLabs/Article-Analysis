PATNA: Minutes before PM   landed in   to attend a Champaran Satyagraha centenary function at Motihari on Tuesday, leader of opposition   Prasad Yadav taunted him for “not doing anything” for the state during the four years of   rule at the Centre.

 “Mr Prime Minister, you didn’t fulfil any of your promises (made to Bihar). You gave it neither the status of special state nor the Rs 1.25 lakh crore (announced by you at an election rally at   in August 2015). You did not even give employment to youths, nor any new project for the state. You also did not grant the status of central university to Patna University,” Tejashwi said in a statement.
 
 The former deputy CM also claimed development work in the state had come to a standstill since July last year when CM Nitish Kumar dumped the Grand Alliance and formed a new government with the  .
 
 Reminding people of the BJP’s claim of having a “double- engine” government in Bihar, Tejashwi asked Nitish to explain what benefits the state got from the Centre after he shook hands afresh with the BJP. 
 
 Reacting over Tejashwi’s taunt, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi sarcastically said leaders of the party that didn’t do any development work during its 15-year rule in the state were beating their chest on the PM’s visit. The BJP leader also claimed the PM inaugurated or laid stones of schemes worth over Rs 3,000 crore during his Motihari visit on Tuesday.
