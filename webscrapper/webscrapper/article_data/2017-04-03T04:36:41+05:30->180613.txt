New Delhi: The   has once again approached the Delhi   seeking to restrain students from staging “dharna” or sit in protests within 100 metres of the administrative block. In a fresh application before the court, the varsity argued that despite HC’s previous advisory, the students have not adhered to the 100 metre norm and continued with protests in the  .

 The plea is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, who had asked the students to ensure the decibel levels remain low during protests so that there is no disturbance in the functioning of the university.
 
 The court had on March 17 modified its order restraining students from   within 100 metres of the administrative block but directed that the protest, if any, should be held peacefully without blocking any roads.
 
 Claiming that the court’s clear cut directions were being disobeyed, despite assurance given by the students, JNU wants the court to take strong action against the violators and issue directions.
 
 It pleaded for “immediate indulgence of the court” while highlighting that on March 23, the students had staged a dharna, burnt the effigy of the VC right outside the administrative block and blocked entry and exit of university officials. While seeking direction to the police to provide adequate security as and when requested, the plea sought direction that “no dharna/demonstration/street plays should be allowed with or without noise making instruments within 100 metres of the administrative block.” The court fixed the plea for hearing on April 12.
 
 The court had earlier too acted on JNU’s plea against the blocking of its administrative department by the agitating students and suggested the JNU Students’ Union and the administration to have a meaningful dialogue among them to solve the problems.
