NEW DELHI: Although chairman of the committee of administrators (CoA)   has said that  's old guards can go ahead with the proposed   in the Capital on April 9, there are doubts whether the board's own rule book allows such a move.

 TOI understands that the SGM will be invalid if members who are above 70 years and also disqualified in terms of nine years each in the board and state units, attend it, according to the  's guidelines.
 
 The SGM is also invalid because an elected managing committee of BCCI is supposed to call such a meeting and with elections still to be held under the new constitution, holding the Delhi meeting could become a contentious point again in the days to come.
 
 "According to the   judgment and Lodha Committee's recommendations, the SGM will not be a valid one because there is no 'elected body' in the State Associations who have adopted the administrative reforms. Therefore, the representatives are all invalid ones and can't be officially holding an important meeting like the SGM," a source, who is a key member of BCCI's day-to-day affairs, told TOI on Saturday.
 
 However, it was made clear that the disqualified officials could meet 'unofficially' and there would be no bar on such a gathering.
