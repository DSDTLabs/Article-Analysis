NAGPUR:   rates have slipped to Rs80 to 85 a kg at retail counters. With the best quality fetching not more than Rs72 a kg in bulk markets, wholesalers say rates of the commodity have reached a three year low. A further slide of around Rs10 a kg is expected. 

 The common source of protein in the country tur dal was in news for  , in 2015. Traders say bulk imports of the commodity by government, coupled with stock limit on domestic traders has helped in easing the rates. However, at the same time farmers who had increased tur cultivation, are now fetching a rate below the minimum support price (MSP). Imposing stock limit has prevented hoarding and imports have ensured enough supply in the domestic markets. 
 
 Tur whole is processed in edible form as dal is now in the range of Rs35 to 47 a kg. Pratap Motwani the secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association said, the MSP for tur has been fixed at Rs5050 a quintal. However the local variety is fetching Rs4600 to 4700 a quintal. The African variety which has a lower grade is available for Rs3500 a quintal.
 
 Motwani said government should now consider the framersâ€™ loss. If the rates do not improve, farmers may not be interested in growing enough tur in next season. Allowing exports can help in increasing the rates. 
 
 Rates of chana dal which wad touched a high last year have come down to Rs95 a kg after having crossed 100. In select stores it is still in the range of Rs100 to 110.   dal is at Rs72 a with urad dal over Rs100 a kg.
