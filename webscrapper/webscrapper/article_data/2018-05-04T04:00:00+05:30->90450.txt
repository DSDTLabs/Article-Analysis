Surat: At last some light on compromise is in sight between affected land loser families and the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) in Umra. SMC is likely to allot land to these 22 families under special category to complete the Pal-Umra bridge at the earliest,   

 SMC commissioner M Thennarasan told TOI, “We have given the proposal of allotting land at one go to all families by way of a 1,200 sq metre plot nearby, where they can build their homes. The maximum allotment to one beneficiary will be 50 sq metre. If a beneficiary has lost more than 50 metre of land, he can get the compensation for remaining land chunk as per norms.” 
 
 SMC has 1,200 sq metre of plot nearby, and believes that all 22 land losers can build their homes on that plot. According to sources, at least eight to 10 of the affected families have accepted this offer and the rest are likely to follow them in the coming days. 
 
 The fate of this Rs 89.99 crore bridge hangs in balance due to 22 families not vacating their homes which came in the way of bridge construction. However, in 2016, after the authority was given to the municipal commissioner, negotiations with affected citizens started, and now it seems to be yielding some results. 
 
 After two years of legal battle in 2014-15 when the ball came back to SMC court, it suggested three options to the affected people. First, allotting more floor space index to the affected citizens, second being cash compensation to the affected citizens at jantri rate and third and last option being plot allotment of the same size at nearby spot. 
 
 The decision to build this bridge was taken in 2012 and after legal and other administrative hassles for six years, it is almost ready. If the compromise stays and affected 22 families accept the plot marked for them as special allotment, this bridge will be ready by June 25 and will give a big relief to the traffic moving from Pal to Athwa-Umra and vice-versa.
