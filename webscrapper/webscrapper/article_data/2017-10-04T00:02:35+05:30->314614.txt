Chennai: Several early risers at Neelankarai on East Coast Road were witness to an unusual sight on Tuesday morning. A team of police personnel led by a young IPS officer on bikes chased and nabbed two chain snatchers trying to flee.

 A court later sent the arrested men Siva Kandan Perumal, 20, of Thideer Nagar in Saidapet and Thangaraj Janakiraman, 20, of Vettuvankeni to jail.
 
 The officer who led the chase, deputy commissioner of police Rohit Nathan, said he was at the vehicle check point and monitoring the checking of vehicles when the two suspects broke throught the cordon and tried to speed away.
 
 “I immediately got on to a police vehicle and chased the suspects. I was followed by my men on separate bikes. After a brief chase, we managed to nab the suspects,” said Nathan, a graduate of Anna Univeristy. 
 
 A police officer at the vehicle check point said: “We suspected something was amiss when the two men refused to reveal their bike registration number. Later, we found that it was a fake registration number. When pressed further, they claimed the bike belonged to a friend and they slipped away under the pretext of reaching his friend on their mobile.”
 
 After they were nabbed, police recovered a two sovereign gold chain that the duo admitted they had snatched from a woman on Monday night. Preliminary inquiries revealed that Perumal and Janakiraman began snatching mobile phones from unsuspecting pedestrians before graduating to snatching gold chains from women on lonely stretches, police said.
