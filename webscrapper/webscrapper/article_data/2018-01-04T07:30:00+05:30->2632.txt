Mohali: A 30-year-old man shot himself under the influence of alcohol at his rented accommodation in Mataur in the early hours of Tuesday.

 Kiranjit Singh, who works at a call centre in Mohali, was admitted to a hospital. The bullet had got stuck in his neck, posing a threat of causing major damage.
 
 On Tuesday night, Kiranjit was consuming alcohol with his friends, who were sharing the accommodation with him. The victim was allegedly depressed following his mother’s death a few months ago. He pulled out her photographs and started crying, said his friends. While they went out of the room for some work, the victim found the licensed revolver of Gurwinder Pal Singh, one of his flatmates, and fired.
 
 His friends took him to the hospital. On Wednesday morning, police recorded Kiranjit’s statement. The victim told cops that he couldn’t control himself and was missing his late mother.
 
 Kiranjit’s friends said he was fine in the beginning and was talking to all the people. While after some time, he started talking about his mother, and got very emotional.
 
 Sub-inspector Ashwani Kumar, the investigation officer, said “The victim was referred to PGI for treatment. Kiranjit was under depression following his mother’s death. The weapon he used is a .32 calibre revolver.”
