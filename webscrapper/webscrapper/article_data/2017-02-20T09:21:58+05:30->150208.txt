ITANAGAR: Days after  's wife demanded a probe into the allegations made by the former chief minister in his 60-page note,  , before he committed suicide, the state cabinet has resolved to forward the original notes to the Union ministry of home affairs for further investigation by any agency, "as deemed fit". 

 After holding discussions about the alleged disclosure of 'Mere Vichaar', government spokespersons Bamang   and PD Sona said the cabinet has come to a consensus about forwarding the matter to a central agency for investigation. After Pul's notes were allegedly disclosed, his first wife Dangwimsai broke her silence on February 11, seeking a CBI inquiry into her husband's death.
 
 Clearly terming the allegations in the notes as "baseless, false and without any evidence", Felix said 'Mere Vichaar', as the title goes, contains only Pul's views and cannot be considered a suicide note. 
 
 On the repeated demand by Dangwimsai for the resignation of chief minister   and deputy chief minister Chowna Mein for a free and fair investigation into the death of her husband, Sona said, "Since there is no sign of foul play, it would not be reasonable for any minister or government official to step down."
