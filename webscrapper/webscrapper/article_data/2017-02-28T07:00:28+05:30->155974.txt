Only eight turned up for the function.  , one of the winners, had in fact scolded the municipal officer for wasting his time and even accused the officer of making prank calls for dubious contests. It took several minutes of convincing before Vaghela realized that the call was genuine. 
 
 “A housewife who had uploaded pictures of a dog carcass on the app and won the lucky draw did not need any convincing at all,” says a senior   official. Three of the 11 award winners did not turn up to collect their phone on Monday. AMC mayor   gave away the mobile phones to the winners.
