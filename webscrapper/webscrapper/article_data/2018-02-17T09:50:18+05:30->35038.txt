HYDERABAD: Former minister and leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council Mohd   on Friday said chief minister   “roars like a lion in   but behaves like a cat” in Delhi. He charged KCR with failing to get adequate funds for Telangana in the Union budget and not raising voice against Prime Minister   seeking more funding for projects.

 Shabbir Ali and   former secretary and deputy floor leader in the Council Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy said that while MPs from the neighbouring state were fighting in Parliament for special status and the assurances made in the AP Reorganisation Act, the TRS MPs have failed to even voice their protest despite getting only ?450 crore against the demand for ?42,000 crore.
 
 Shabbir also charged the TRS with failing to pursue the 12% Muslim reservation bill and ST reservation enhancement bill for ratification in Parliament months after the two resolutions were passed in the Telangana Assembly.
