INDORE: Alleged Rajput   members on Monday barged into   in MP’s Ratlam and went on the rampage, incensed that kindergarten students were dancing to the   from Padmavat.

 Witnesses say the toughs pushed some children off the stage. The violence triggered panic among children and parents and nearly led to a stampede in the rush to escape.
 
 School principal Devendra Munat told police that LKG children had prepared dances on Bollywood songs for the annual function of primary and pre-primary sections. A little child had prepared a medley of songs, he said. “One of the songs was a portion of Ghoomar. We stopped it and asked the child to continue with the performance without playing the song,” he said.
 
 Around 10.30am, 20-25 men barged into the school and started smashing the music system, speakers and furniture, and pushed children off the stage, the principal said. The goons broke chairs and threw them at the children and spectators, he alleged. The school’s cash office was ransacked and two notice boards broken to pieces by Karni Sena members, Munat told police. Thankfully, no one was hurt.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 As panic spread, Industrial Area Jaora police station in-charge MPS Parihar rushed with his men, forcing the attackers to flee. “We have arrested four persons who were trying to escape,” he told TOI.
 
 The suspects have been booked for trespass, assault, wrongful restraint, rioting with a deadly weapon and criminal intimidation, Parihar said.
 
 Police are going through the school’s CCTV footage to identify the attackers, the inspector added. News of the violence sparked outrage in the area. The Ashashikiya Shikshan Sangh — a body of private schools — submitted a memorandum to SDM Shirali Jain, seeking action against Rajput Karni Sena for ransacking the school and attacking children and parents. The Sena had earlier warned schools against playing the   song, claiming that it “lowers the dignity of Rajput women.”
