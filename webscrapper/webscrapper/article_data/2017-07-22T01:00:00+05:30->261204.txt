This six-member band sing out loud messages of love, peace and harmony through abhangas (poetries by saints) by saints like Eknath, Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram. Comprising Swapnil Tarphe (bass guitarist),   (drummer),   (percussionist),   (harmonium),   (vocalist) and   (acoustic guitarist), it was formed by Swapnil and Dushyant, both drummers in their college. Barely two years old, they have already crossed the 100-gig mark.

 
 
 Unsure of whether or not they will appeal to the masses, the members had their share of doubts. “We had an urge to raise social awareness and didn’t know how poetries by these saints would work with the crowd. However, our gig during   last year in Girgaon turned out to be the turning point of our career. Besides getting more shows and funding, we gathered a strong belief in our work and it boosted our morale. Post that, we were featured in a video that was shown on an entertainment channel, which brought a Marathi band straight to people’s home. The appreciation we received thereon was extremely overwhelming,” says Swapnil.
 
 
 
 Taking up popular verses like 'Amhi Bi Ghadalo', 'Chandanache Haath', 'Deh Dewache Mandir' for their songs, the band fuses these abhangas with jazz, rock, reggae, Indian classical, folk and other genres. Speaking about the band’s aim and name, Swapnil adds, “We want to disseminate the saints’ messages in a non-conventional fashion. Today’s youth needs to know about these poetries, so we decided to ‘post’ these verses in a form they like. That’s how the band’s name came along.” We wish Abhanga, which means indestructible, encourages people to live a peaceful life.”
