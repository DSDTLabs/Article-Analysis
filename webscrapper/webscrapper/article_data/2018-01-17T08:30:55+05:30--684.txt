GUWAHATI: Locals brought out a candlelight rally at   on Tuesday, demanding prompt police action in the alleged murder of city-based trader Bhupendar Singh. 

 Singh, the owner of a popular food joint in the city, was allegedly rammed by an SUV last week, succumbing to his injuries on Saturday night. The car which rammed Singh reportedly had three unidentified drunk youths, two of whom were women. A police officer said, "The deceased engaged in a heated altercation with the accused youths over a parking issue. The gang, members of which are believed to have been drunk, hit him and fled the spot."
 
 Locals blame city police for not investigating the case seriously. "Police are trying to cover it up as an accident case, whereas it is a murder case. Moreover, how can it be that the police are yet to arrest anybody or recover the SUV? Instead of taking statements of eyewitnesses seriously, the police have been threatening them," said a protester who took to the streets on Tuesday.
 
 Guwahati (East) police officials said a search has been initiated to nab the culprits and seize the vehicle. "It it known that the vehicle was a white SUV but even the eyewitness have not been able to provide us with any registration number. CCTV cameras could not capture the license plate either, making it difficult to find the vehicle," a source said. Police have been quizzing owners of vehicle showrooms and garages in search of leads.
