AHMEDABAD: With more Indian tourists going to Indonesia, there is ample scope for a direct air connection between the two countries, consul general of Indonesia, Saut   said. He was in Ahmedabad on Monday to promote tourism in Indonesia. In December the country’s national airline,  , introduced a direct flight between Mumbai and Djakarta. Gujarat accounts for the largest chunk of the 3.4 lakh Indian tourists who visited Indonesia last year.

 Further emphasizing direct connectivity, Siringoringo said, “There is ample scope for direct air connectivity between the two countries. Tourists from across Gujarat, even tier-II and tier-III cities such as Surat, Rajkot and Kutch apart from Ahmedabad and Vadodara have been travelling to Indonesia. Moreover, it is also a popular location for destination weddings.” “We hope that more flights will be introduced from Ahmedabad, Delhi and even Chennai. This along with free visa policy for Indian tourists will surely help boost tourism,” he added.
 
 About the challenges, Siringoringo said: “The majority of Indian tourists flock to Bali and don’t explore other destinations which are indeed worth visiting. It’s a big challenge to educate the industry stakeholders so people can explore more destinations.”
