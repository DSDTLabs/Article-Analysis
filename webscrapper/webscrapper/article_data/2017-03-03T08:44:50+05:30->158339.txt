BERHAMPUR: With Cuttack in the grip of jaundice, the fear of a similar outbreak of the   looms over Berhampur town as the water supply pipes in several areas here pass through drains. This apprehension was voiced by several corporators of the   (BMC) at a meeting on Thursday. 

 "We can't rule out the possibility of the breakout of a water-borne disease, particularly jaundice, if the sewerage water gets into the drinking water supply pipes," said  , a corporator. "Shortage of water supply and the rising day temperature may further aggravate the situation in the town," added corporator B Srinivas. Yet another corporator Surendra Moharana advised that the BMC should take up the matter with engineers of the public health engineering department (PHED) and replace the pipes which have been lying in the sewerage drains. 
 
 E  , the assistant health officer (AHO) of BMC, said they had already identified some areas where the water supply pipelines were laid inside the drains. "We will soon conduct a survey and write to the PHED asking them to shift those pipelines" he added. 
 
 Last year, the BMC had asked the PHED to shift the piped water supply lines from the drains when jaundice had spread to several towns. "Though some of these have been shifted, several pipes in different areas are still lying in the drains," said a BMC official. Since water-borne diseases usually raise their ugly head during this time, the PHED engineers should take necessary steps to shift the pipelines from the drains at the earliest, he explained. 
 
 BMC's AHO Patra, however, said there was no case of a water-borne disease had been reported from anywhere in the town so far. On being contacted, PHED's executive engineer  , said they had already shifted the pipelines from the drains to safer places in different areas. 'We have requested the corporators to bring them to our notice. We will take immediate steps for shifting of the pipes" he assured.
