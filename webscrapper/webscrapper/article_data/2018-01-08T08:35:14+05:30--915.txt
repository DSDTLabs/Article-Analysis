IMPHAL: A tremor measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale jolted   on Sunday afternoon at 12.17 pm. There have been no reports of human casualty or damage to structures, but the tremor triggered panic among people in the state's valley districts. 

 Seconds after the tremor was felt in the capital, people living in multi-storied buildings rushed out and grouped together far away from tall buildings. Traffic along the busy Thangal Bazzar, Paona Bazzar and BT Road was disrupted for a short time as people frantically ran out from their residences. Fearing aftershocks, parents herded out their small children to nearby open spaces.
 
 The epicentre of the quake is reported to be at the India-Myanmar border, about 100 km from Imphal, at a depth of 40 km.
