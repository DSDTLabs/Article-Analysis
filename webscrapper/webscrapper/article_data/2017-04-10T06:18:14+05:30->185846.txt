 Pilot too matched her by holding over 200 public meetings and spending over 18 days in the backward region as a win for   will be a big boost to the opposition party ahead of the state assembly polls later next year. 
 
 The Congress had suffered a rout in 2013 assembly polls and then complete decimation in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when it did not win a single seat out of 25, but is seen to have recovered some ground under Pilot who led the party to a good show in local elections.
