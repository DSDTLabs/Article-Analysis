PATNA: The Bihar government on Thursday submitted in the   a letter of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, saying the   at Shaguna Mor in Patna was being constructed without prior environment clearance.
 
  The mall is coming up on a plot owned by a firm run by the family of RJD president  .
  
  The Union ministry’s letter was attached with a counter affidavit filed by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board in reply to a PIL of advocate Manibhushan Pratap Sengar. The PIL has sought the court’s directive for an independent inquiry into the mall construction and alleged illegal sale of soil to the   by the mall developers.
  
  The state pollution board’s counter affidavit says absence of environment clearance is a violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The pollution board has also attached with its counter affidavit a copy its order to mall developer Abu Dozana to stop the construction work.
  
  Dozana is the MD of Meridian Construction (India) Limited, which is constructing the mall. The order to Dozana was issued on May 19, four days after the Union ministry on May 15 directed the state government to stop the construction work at the site.
  
  The Union ministry’s letter says any project with a built-up area of 20,000 square metre or more requires environment clearance. The mall’s built-up area is 71,214 square metre.
  
  “Now that it is officially on record that the mall was being constructed in violation of rules, the soil excavation for the project and the sale of soil to the zoo also become illegal,” Sengar told TOI on Thursday.
