AURANGABAD: The state government’s decision to restore licences of permit rooms and bars on national and state highways will benefit 343 such   in the district. 

 Alarmed by the large number of fatal accidents on highways, the   had directed that all liquor shops within 500 metre from the highways be closed. But, based on an opinion from attorney general   that the ban applies only to shops where liquor is sold in retail, the government has directed its officials to restore the licences of permit rooms and bars.
 
 State excise superintendent C B Rajput, however, told TOI, “There is no official communication about restoring licences of permit rooms and bars. Whatever we have learnt is through the reports carried by newspapers.”
 
 The officer said if the government restores the licences of permit rooms and bars, it will benefit 343 liquor serving set-ups. 
 
 For identifying liquor outlets and shops violating the 500m norm, committees comprising officials from the state excise department, PWD, national highway authority, revenue, land record and town planning, were formed and based on their findings, notices were served to 506 liquor set-ups.
