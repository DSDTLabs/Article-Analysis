NEW DELHI: After a series of developments which seemed to offset its stated India First policy, Maldivian foreign minister and President Abdulla Yameen’s special envoy Mohamed Asim will seek to allay some of the concerns of the Indian government during a three-day visit to India starting on Wednesday.

 As reported by TOI on December 26,   seemed to be reaching out to Delhi last month by discussing the possibility of a high-level bilateral visit to address some of the issues which have raised hackles in India. This includes Male’s decision to sign a free trade agreement with China without taking the Maldivian opposition into confidence.
 
 Male had recently suspended three local councillors for having an “unauthorised” meeting with Indian ambassador  . This was followed by an editorial in a pro-Yameen newspaper which, while describing India as an enemy, called for Male to find a new best friend in China.
 
 It also called PM   an extremist Hindu and anti-Muslim.
 
 Apart from meeting his counterpart  , Asim will call on Modi on Thursday. “This will be an opportunity to reset ties. We expect frank discussions,” an official here said.
 
 Earlier, reaching out, Yameen had earlier reiterated that his administration would never entertain negative sentiments towards India. He had further said his government was working towards a free trade agreement between the Maldives and India.
 
 After the China FTA, India had said it expected Male to be sensitive to its concerns. “We should look beyond these developments and we should have diplomatic discussions between the two sides to address any issue between the two countries,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.
