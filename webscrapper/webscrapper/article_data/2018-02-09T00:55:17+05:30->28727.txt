MUMBAI: A   national was deported from   and brought to Mumbai on Thursday in connection with an ATM skimmer racket busted at Dahisar East. This is the second Romanian national arrested in this case. The duo had been living at a suburban hotel with two others, police said. 

 “The first accused was caught red-handed while removing a skimmer he had attached to an unguarded ATM on Tuesday. He told us that he had arrived in Mumbai on January 24 on a three-month tourist visa. We scrutinised his cellphone and found a video clip that showed him staying at a hotel. On contacting the hotel, we learnt that three others were with him. We immediately issued lookout notices. One of these men had left for Paris. But due to the  , he was intercepted at Dubai airport and sent back to Mumbai. We have taken him into custody. He is in his mid-thirties," said an official from Dahisar police.
 
 Police have intimated the Romanian consulate. Police are, however, facing trouble communicating with the accused as they speak broken English. “We can't be sure if they genuinely don’t speak English well or are faking it so as to no cooperate with investigators,” an official said. tnn
