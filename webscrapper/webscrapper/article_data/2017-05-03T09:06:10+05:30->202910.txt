MADURAI: Stating that a Union government circular insisting on sale of pure   had not been properly implemented and the   ( ) had also failed to check their purity, a public interest petition has been filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. 

 S Alagujothi from Theni's Periyakulam filed the case. He said that the Union government had in 2008 issued a circular directing all the states that   jewellery with 22 carat (92% purity) only should be sold and the sale should be monitored by the state government. 
 
 But, the Tamil Nadu government did not follow the circular. Taking advantage of it, many shops were selling gold jewellery below 22 ct. In Madurai alone, there are 2,250 jewellery shops. 
 
 The Bureau of Standards (BIS) should inspect all the jewellery and make a BIS Hallmark seal in every jewel after satisfying that it is of 22 ct. But, many jewellery shop owners get BIS Hallmark seal to a certain quantity of jewellery and sell all of them as if they were of 22 ct.
 
 People in many districts, including Madurai had lodged complaints to the police. But, the police who were supposed to act on the complaints remained silent.
 
  Seeking proper inquiry and to take action against erring jewellery shops, a representation was sent to the state's home secretary, commercial tax commissioner, BIS and DGP on March 29, last year. But, there was no action on their part. 
 
 Hence, it was necessary to take action against the jewellery shop owners who sell impure gold jewellery in the state particularly in Madurai, Theni and   districts, the petitioner said. 
 
 When the case came up for admission, the court adjourned the case to July 18.
