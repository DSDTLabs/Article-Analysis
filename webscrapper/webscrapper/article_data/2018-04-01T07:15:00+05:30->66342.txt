Gurgaon:   has floated a fresh tender for the construction of a one-km long road in Sector 23A. The work on the road was suspended last year to make way for the replacement of a water pipeline.

 Residents told TOI that the old plastic pipeline was replaced as it was prone to frequent leakage. The asphalting work on the road could not take place before installation of the new pipeline.
 
 Two days ago, MCG floated the new tender. “This stretch is between house number 1004 to 1319,” said Malkhan Singh Yadav, president, RWA, Sector 23A. “Residents were using bad roads for a couple of years when last year MCG floated a tender of Rs 1 crore and 26 lakh. The work included laying of asphalt and bitumen. However, we had sought an exemption for this stretch because of the old pipelines.” 
 
 Harsh, another resident, said, “Water shortage was becoming a major issue in this area because of the faulty pipeline. We asked for replacement of the plastic pipes with cast iron ones and requested MCG to construct the road later.” MCG officials said that work on the road was likely to start by next week. “The tender is worth nearly Rs 40 lakh,” an official said.
