Luca Guadagnino, director of the Oscar-nominated movie  , has revealed that it might not be the last time we see   nominee   as his character  .

 
  
  According to a report, the 46-year-old filmmaker said that he plans to return for the sequel of the critically acclaimed movie. He also shared that sequel will pick up exactly where the first film left off.
 
  Guadagnino said, "In my opinion, 'Call Me' can be the first chapter of the chronicles of the life of these people that we met in this movie, and if the first one is a story of coming-of-age and becoming a young man, maybe the next chapter will be, what is the position of the young man in the world, what does he want - and what is left a few years later of such an emotional punch that made him who he is?"
  Guadagnino also revealed that he would like the sequel to tackle the   epidemic of the 1980s and '90s head on.
 
  The directors noted, "I think it's going to be a very relevant part of the story. I think Elio will be a cinephile, and I'd like him to be in a movie theatre watching  's 'Once More'."
 
  It should be noted that 'Call me by your Name' has been nominated for three Oscars, including Best Picture, a Best Actor nod for Timothee Chalament and Best Adapted Screenplay.
