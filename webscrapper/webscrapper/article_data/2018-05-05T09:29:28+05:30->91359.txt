BENGALURU: At least seven candidates contesting   have their roots in Kerala. A majority of them, including Bengaluru development minister K J George (Sarvagnanagar), food minister U T Khader (Mangaluru) and N A Haris (Shantinagar) are contesting on Congress tickets. All the three are sitting MLAs.

 
 With just a week left for elections, the Congress has roped in several leaders from Kerala to woo voters in areas that have a sizeable Malayali population.
 
 Spearheading the Congress campaign in Malayali pockets on Friday was former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy. Starting his two-day campaign in the city, Chandy attended meetings and conducted roadshows in areas like Dasarahalli, Rajarajeshwarinagar, Shanthinagar, C V Raman Nagar and Chamarajpet , which have a sizeable Malayali population.
 
 Addressing voters in Malayalam, Chandy urged them to vote for Congress candidates in the respective constituencies. In C V Raman Nagar, Chandy, who wore his signature smile, climbed on to a campaign vehicle with mayor R Sampath Raj and waved at the crowd.
 
 Another star campaigner from Kerala is Shashi Tharoor, MP from Thiruvananthapuram. Tharoor, who is also chairman of All India Professionals Congress, on Friday campaigned in Indiranagar and Mahadevapura areas, which has sizeable educated voters. In his speeches in English, he highlighted the misrule of NDA government and achievements of Karnataka government, particularly among the young voters.
 
 The Malayali population in the city is estimated to be over 10 lakh.
 
 Chandy will also attend rallies in Byatarayanapura, K R Puram, Sarvagnanagar, BTM Layout and Bommanahalli on Saturday.
