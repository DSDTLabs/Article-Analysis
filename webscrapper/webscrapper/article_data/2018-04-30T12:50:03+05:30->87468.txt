MUMBAI: In a move that will channel more funds from abroad into  , the   ( ) has allowed   ( ) to pick up short-term   by removing the residual maturity requirement. The central bank has also relaxed rules for external   (ECBs). The decision is expected to reduce yields and may support the   as well. 

 
 Over the weekend, the central bank announced a number of relaxations for investment by FPIs in government bonds. The RBI has allowed FPIs to purchase gilts that are about to mature. Additionally, it has done away with the auction mechanism for this segment of investors in G-secs. The RBI has also revised the ceiling for FPI investment in gilts to 30% of their portfolio from 20% earlier.
 
 For companies seeking to raise funds through ECBs, the RBI has harmonised the all-in-cost ceiling over the benchmark rate. Earlier, the ceiling used to range from 300 to 500 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) above the  , or US Libor. This has now been harmonised to 450bps. This will enable more companies to tap international markets for borrowing.
 
 According to bankers, the RBI decision to allow foreign investors in short-duration government securities is a major step. FPIs, who are typically investors in equity, look for short-term investment options to manage their liquidity. The RBI has been reluctant to allow FPIs into short-term bonds because their investments are seen as hot money and there are concerns that they might cause wide fluctuations in gilt yields.
 
 Another reason for caps on foreign investment in government bonds was the fear that it would cause the rupee to appreciate, which would cause an overvaluation. The current scenario is seen as conducive for relaxing investment ceilings as the rupee is weakening and yields are on the rise. Even if there is a surge in inflows, it will only stem the correction.
