SURAT: City police plan to launch a programme for the rehabilitation of minor and adult individuals who either had committed some crime in the past or have been victims. 

 The programme ‘Samarth’ will be launched by chief minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday.
 
 “Samarth is focused in rehabilitating those who have become victims of some crime, minor offenders and those facing social or psychological issues. We have already started taking steps to train minors to acquire some skills,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said. 
 
 Police recently trained 32 minors who had criminal history. They were trained by police and qualified trainers for seven days in different life skills and were given certificates too. The training was conducted at the police headquarters where minors were given food too. Police started with 80 minors but many of them dropped out.
 
 Those willing to participate in   can call police control room numbers 0261-2241301 or 2242302. The caller will be provided details about the programme and if selected, police will provide psychological help and other support to join the mainstream society.
 
 “As a part of the project, we are concentrating on minors who enter criminal world at an early age and continue committing crime due to its vicious circle. They never get an opportunity to become a civilized person,” Sharma added.
 
 “But police will help them get a fresh perspective about themselves for which we are taking help of psychologists. We will train them for employment and also ensure that they get job. With police help, they can get job easily. It is an opportunity for them to stay away from committing crime,” he added.
 
 Police are not targeting big numbers at initial level. Only after successful rehabilitation of first few will the police enroll more aspirants.
