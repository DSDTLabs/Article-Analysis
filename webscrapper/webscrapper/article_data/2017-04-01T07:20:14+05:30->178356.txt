LUCKNOW: Armed with favourable forensic reports, city police is all set to wrap up investigations into the   death case. The MBBS doctor and chest specialist was found dead on the terrace of his bungalow in sector C,   on February 2.

 As the two gunshots fired at Sircar’s skull were found 8cm apart, thorough probes were needed to put doubts to rest. Additional superintendent of trans-Gomti police Durgesh Kumar was supervising the investigation.
 
 “Medico-legal expert and joint director of Mahanagar forensic science laboratory G Khan stated in his report that Sircar’s death may have been suicidal. Handwriting analysis of suicide note recovered from the house also confirmed that Sircar was the one who wrote the note,” said Durgesh, who said entry in the general diary will be made to close the matter in a day or two.
 
 Police had initiated inquest proceedings under CrPC section 174 which empowers an officer to probe suicide case if there is any doubt regarding cause of death. According to sources, Khan in his report had attributed the tandem bullet shot theory. When two gunshots are fired from the barrel simultaneously, tandem shot injuries are caused on the person.
 
 “Instead of digging deep, Lucknow police relied on forensic reports which second its theory,” said head of forensic medicine department at private university Abhas Kumar Singh.
 
 The ballistic report, also prepared by Mahanagar forensic laboratory in the said case are not consistent with the suicide theory. The experts of ballistic division have mentioned clearly that the two shots were fired from close range and were not contact wounds as in suicide.
 
 The postmortem report also does not show burning on Joydeep’s skin. In suicide cases, person usually fires after holding the barrel against his skin and burning and charring is noticed around the entry wound. Durgesh, however, said all aspects had been checked and nothing to prove otherwise was found.
