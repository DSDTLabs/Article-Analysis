LUCKNOW: The absence of   from byelections in   and   has given a chance to its rivals to cut into  's votes. 

 In 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly polls, BSP had a share of around 20% votes in these two seats though it failed to win either of them. 
 
 BSP sources said Mayawati will not ask her cadres to get her vote bank transfer to other party. 
 
  "Party supporters have been left to decide on their own," a BSP leader told TOI. 
 
 "PM   and CM Adityanath Yogi favour politics of development and not caste-based politics. That is why people from all castes, including Dalits and MBCs, voted for BJP in 2014 and 2017 elections. They will continue to do so," said UP BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan.
 
 The   feels the growing resentment against the BJP government will tilt voters in its favour. SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said Mayawati's voters understand a close resemblance between the ideology of Ram Manohar Lohia and BR Ambedkar. "Voters of every caste will support SP to teach BJP a lesson in the bypolls," he told TOI.
 
 The   claims it has the backing of BSP voters. "When BSP does not contest, majority of its Dalit votes come to the Congress. Obviously there may be few exceptions. This time, Congress will surely receive a good support from all communities, including Dalits and MBCs," said Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh.
