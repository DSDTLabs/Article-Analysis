CHENNAI: Expressing hope that the Election Commission of India would announce a date for RK Nagar by-election at the earliest and conduct the election preferably before December 31, Madras high court has brought closed a PIL filed in that regard.

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M Sundar made the observation while disposing of a PIL moved by  . The petition sought a direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to conduct election to the assembly constituency, which fell vacant following the demise of   on December 5, 2016.
 
 A recent attempt made by the ECI to conduct the election on April 12 was cancelled following allegations of electoral malpractices, including largescale distribution of cash to voters.
 
 Noting that the ECI’s failure to conduct the election is against democracy and the Constitution, the petitioner said: “As per the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, if any constituency falls vacant due to the death of the sitting legislator, by-election should be conducted within six months. But contravening the mandate the ECI has not announced election for the RK Nagar constituency so far.”
