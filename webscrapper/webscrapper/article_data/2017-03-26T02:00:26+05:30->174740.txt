PATNA: New York University’s Prof Kanchan Chandra on Saturday outlined the implications of the decimation of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the just-concluded UP assembly election for the nation.   “The problem lies in the fact that the process of subalternisation is limited only to outward manifestation through legislation and there is no proper way to bring other subaltern groups from the society to prominent positions inside a party. The BSP and the SP, two powerful regional parties which are supposed to be led by so-called deprived castes, have failed to build a second line of leadership beyond Mayawati or Mulayam Singh Yadav and relatives,” said Chandra.    She was delivering her lecture on ‘Democracy from the Margins’ on the second day of an international conference on ‘Bihar and Jharkhand: Shared History to Shared Vision’, organised by Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) to mark its silver jubilee celebrations.    According to Chandra, an inclusive democracy is desirable in that it sends out a signal of empowerment and representation of the marginalised in the polity.    “Over the years, the Indian political scenario has moved towards subalternisation, but it is over-hyped as a data collected from the composition of Parliament in 2014 shows that 70% Backward Caste, 83% Scheduled Caste, 92% Scheduled Tribe and 50% Muslim MPs are from parties dominated by upper caste leaders like the Congress and the BJP, among others. The rise of Narendra Modi, who is vocal about his background, shows a changing scenario of political inclusion,” Chandra said.    Prof Vinita Damodaran of the University of Sussex delivered a lecture on ‘Adivasis and the Anthropocene: Towards an Environmental History of Eastern India’. Her lecture was based on her twin visits to Saranda forests in Jharkhand in 2005 and 2013.
