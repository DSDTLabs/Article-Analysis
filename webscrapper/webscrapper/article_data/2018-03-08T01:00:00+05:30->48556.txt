 Speaking about the film, producer Sajid Qureshi says, “Today, when everyone is talking about women empowerment, our film showcases the troubles, difficulties and dilemmas that women face in their day-to-day lives. Unfortunately, there are very few government helpline numbers that help women who want to end their lives. With this musical short, I urge the Government of India to take up women’s safety issues seriously and provide more suicide-prevention services.”
