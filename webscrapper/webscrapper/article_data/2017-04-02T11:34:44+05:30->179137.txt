VADODARA: A   on Friday claimed that a professor of   was recently caught red-handed watching   on his mobile phone. Demanding that the state government should take over the control of the university, the outfit – Yuva Sena Sangathan- which submitted a memorandum to the district officials – claimed that a professor of mechanical engineering department was watching inside a workshop of the department. “When students captured this act of the professor in their mobile, they were threatened of not making it viral while the professor was suspended,” claimed Lakhan Darbar. 

 The management, however, said that it is an old incident. “It was before two months that a staffer had informed me about a lab assistant in mechanical engineering department watching objectionable content on his cell phone. We had immediately terminated the lab assistant. The lab assistant no longer works with us,” said Parul University’s president
