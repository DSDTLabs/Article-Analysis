 In a shocking incident, an unidentified man with severe head injuries sustained after being hit by a train, had to fight for his life for more than 45 minutes in the absence of doctors and finally succumbed at Gurazala Government Hospital in Guntur district on Thursday.
 
 With the doctors not being present or unwilling to attend to him, sweepers at the hospital tried to save the injured. The man was injured after being hit by a train coming from Macherla to Nadikudi near Rentachintala around 2.10pm. Railway guards rushed him in the same train to Gurazala and he was finally shifted to Gurazala Government Hospital in an ambulance around 2.40pm.
 
 When the patient was admitted, four doctors were supposed to be on duty. However, only deputy civil surgeon Dr Vasu Deva   was present and opted not to attend to the patient. Of the remaining three doctors, one was on leave while the other two were absent. Ironically, even the nursing staff did not care to administer first aid to the patient. On the contrary, the medical staff admonished the ambulance driver for bringing the patient to Gurazala instead of Guntur, said sources.
 
 Left unattended on a stretcher in the verandah of the hospital and profusely bleeding, two sweepers, Mariamma and  , gave him first aid. Finally, about 45 minutes after the patient was wheeled in, Dr Naik declared him dead.
