PUNE: A truck driver, Latif Khajmiya   (52) of  , died after his truck collided against one of the cement pillars of the historic   bridge, near Khandala, on the   expressway. The accident took place late on Saturday night. 

 The truck blocked an entire lane and disrupted vehicular movement towards Mumbai for nearly 30 minutes. 
 
 According to   (City) police, the truck was headed for Mumbai from Pune. It was loaded with heavy (unspecified) material. The road has a gradient at the spot and the truck driver attempted to take a sharp turn beneath the Amrutanjan bridge, police said. 
 
 The police added that an attempt to take a right turn went horribly wrong as the truck hit the pillar. The consignment punched through the driverâ€™s cabin, crushing Shaikh under it.
 
 The Amrutanjan bridge section is infamous for traffic snarls. It was in the news earlier this year as state authorities sought to dismantle the bridge to make the road safer.
