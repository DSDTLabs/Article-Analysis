LUCKNOW: Confrontation between two long-time friends who have turned political rivals took the Uttar Pradesh   by surprise. “Yeh bhaade ki hatya karaate hain, apharan inka dhandha hai aur loot karaate hain (they execute contract killings and it is their business to kidnap and loot),” said law minister   in the Vidhan Sabha last week, referring to the family of erstwhile mafia don Hari Shankar Tewari, whose son Vinay Shankar was seated in the Assembly as a   MLA. Tewari did not react to the attack and sat speechless like other members of the House. 

 The friendship of Vinay Shankar and Brajesh Pathak goes back a long time to the 1980s when they were both students of Lucknow University and were mistaken by many to be brothers. Patahak would escort Hari Shanker who groomed him in politics. It’s well known that Tewari family supported Pathak to ensure his victory in the polls and becoming Lucknow University Students Union president. 
 
 Later, Pathak and Vinay Shanker joined the Bahujan Samaj Party together in the early 2000s and while the latter continued, Pathak quit and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party before recent assembly elections. As a BSP candidate, Tewari challenged Yogi in 2009 Lok Sabha elections in Gorakhpur. Interestingly, the present Delhi   chief Manoj Tiwari was pitted against the two as an SP candidate.
 
 “It was like being stabbed in the back by a brother,” said Vinay Shankar Tewari, adding that political differences apart, such a remark was unprovoked, against people who had never harmed Pathak personally or politically. 
 
 “May be, he said it to please Yogi, but such a below-the-belt attack on a friend as close as family is most undesirable,” said a Rajput Thakur leader of the BJP, who too rose in the ranks from being an LUSU office-bearer.
