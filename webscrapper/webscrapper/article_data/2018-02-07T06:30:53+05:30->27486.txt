LUCKNOW: The family of   communal violence victim   has demanded that ‘tiranga yatras’ be stopped immediately in order to maintain peace and harmony. “There should be an end to ‘tiranga yatra’ if it’s leading to violence and people continue to die like my brother,” Chandan’s sister Kirti told TOI here on Tuesday.

 Kirti and her aunt came to Lucknow to meet chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath.
 
 Although Yogi assured her that the security to the family would be provided, the chief minister remained non-committal on giving martyr status to Chandan, she said.
 
 She said the family had received threats from unknown people in the last few days. “We don’t step out of our home anymore. It’s the first time since Chandan’s death that we stepped out either from home. Two bikers threatened us, saying, ‘Panga lena sahi nahi hai (Don’t take risk)’.” “We are scared. I am not going to college,” the 22-year-old said, adding that the CM assured that security would be provided to the family. She, however, felt that saffron flags should not have drawn flak from anyone. “If you are a Hindu, what is the problem in sporting saffron colour? Even Yogiji sports it,” she said.
