DEHRADUN: Mercurial   leader and   MP Subramanian   who is currently on a visit to Dehradun said at a function in the city on Sunday that the ongoing Ram temple case in the Supreme Court would be over by November, and that the temple would be built in Ayodhya by next year.
 
  Earlier, in an exclusive interaction with   at his house in   on the outskirts of the city, Swamy said that he is gearing up for his next big fight, which is to approach the Supreme Court seeking equal rights for Muslim women in their father’s property. “Triple talaq is an unconstitutional and immoral thing, but so is the issue of denial to a Muslim woman the right to her father’s property. This is often denied to her by male members of the family.”
  
  Swamy also gave credit to the issue of triple talaq for unifying Muslim votes in favour of BJP. “Muslim women clearly understood that no party -- whether it is SP, BSP or the   can give them relief from triple talaq. Raising the issue helped BJP make inroads in many places along with the strategy of unifying Hindus.”
  
  He derided the Opposition for raking the EVM issue which he said he had also raised at one point, but was now convinced that the new EVM machines are fool-proof. “Opposition parties have miserably failed in their role, that is why, instead of looking inwards, they are finding fault with EVMs. I had also challenged the EVMs for their accuracy at one point but now, the upgraded EVMs that are used by the Election Commission are 99.9 % fool proof and there is no possibility of rigging,” said Swami.
