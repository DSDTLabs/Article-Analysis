AHMEDABAD: The   noted that the government allowed   to set up seven   even after objections by a central empowered committee.

 The CAG noted that the panel had rejected the scheme in 2013 on the grounds that the proposal was from a private enterprise for commercial exploitation of forest land and was not a site-specific project. The central panel recorded that 135 windmills were already functioning in the area and all were located outside the boundary of the wild ass sanctuary.
 
 CAG stated that subsequent to amendment in process of obtaining permission, the   for wildlife (PCCF-WL) gave sanction in December 2015 for establishment of these seven windmills in the sanctuary.
 
 It was recorded in the sanction that the member secretary, central empowered committee, directed telephonically in November 2015 to issue permissions. CAG stated that since there was no change in the orders of the CEC, the sanction without any recorded reasons for change in the ground position was not correct and tantamount to violation of the wildlife protection act.
