GURUGRAM: Strong   hit the city on Monday and brought down   and the pollution level. 

 Weather officials said the phenomenon was natural and generally associated with the months of February and March, adding that an anti-cyclonic circulation, currently under way in north-western parts of India might have also played a part. “Strong winds at this point of time are natural and arrest the abrupt rise of temperature,” said an official of regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC). The city’s maximum temperature dropped to 27 degrees Celsius and the minimum was at 14 on Monday. The pollution level also decreased as average concentration of   was recorded at 84.4 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Monday as compared to 115.5 µg/m3 on Sunday. The   on Monday was 215 which is categorised as “unhealthy” but is still better than the “poor” and “very poor” levels the city has seen recently.
 
 Officials said the strong winds were a result of wind diversion. “If you open a tap, its water hits the surface and droplets fly in every direction. A similar situation is happening with the winds. Wind diversion is caused by winds that hurtle down towards the Earth and scatter in all directions,” said an official. The wind speed in the city on Monday was recorded at 35 km/hr. 
 
 The official said that two subsequent   would hit Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and unleash rain in the three states. No precipitation is expected in NCR and Delhi. The temperature in the city would not rise in the next one or two days. “We witnessed pleasant weather today and this will continue on Tuesday. As always, western disturbances in the northern areas would be accompanied with increase in temperature in the plains. So, temperature will remain between 28 to 29 degrees Celsius in the next one or two days and then rise to 31 degrees Celsius because of the western disturbances, before winds from the northern region starts blowing in the city again.”
