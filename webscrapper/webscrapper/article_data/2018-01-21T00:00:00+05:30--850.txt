Every now and then, criticism arises against the Kannada film industry for the sheer number of projects that are remakes of movies from other languages. It is, then, a moment of pride when a reversal of sorts happens and a Kannada film piques the interest of makers in other industries. The latest, we hear, is that the team of   Arts’ film,  , is currently in talks with representatives from none other than Bollywood actor Aamir Khan’s production house for a Hindi version of the movie.
 “We are currently in talks with the team for the remake rights for a Hindi version. A representative from Aamir’s team saw the film over the weekend and they have expressed interest in acquiring the rights. While we are working out the nitty-gritties, the question remains whether Aamir will play Gurunandan’s character, Raju, or Sudeep’s role, which is pivotal to the narrative,” says producer KA Suresh.
