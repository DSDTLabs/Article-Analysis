LUCKNOW: Reacting to the bribery allegations against  , Art of Living (AoL) founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said on Thursday that the cleric made no such demand during his interaction with him.

 “Some people seem to be working to derail and discredit the dialogue process,” he said and added that he too would probe the genuineness of accusations levelled by   of Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Nirman Nyas.
 
 Speaking on behalf of Sri Sri, AoL director, Gautam Vig said they were not informed about any talks between Nadwi and Mishra on February 5 (the day bribe was allegedly demanded). In fact, Vig said that Mishra informed Sri Sri about the issue over phone only on February 14, after speaking to media.
 
 “We will probe the genuineness of his complaint. As far as our interaction with Maulana Nadwi is concerned, there were no such demands,” he said.
 
 Vig added that no team had been set up for settlement of Ayodhya dispute as claimed by Mishra.
 
 “It is an open forum. We have not formed any team. Gurudev directly speaks to the stake holders. And anyone and everyone who is willing to participate is welcome,” he said.
