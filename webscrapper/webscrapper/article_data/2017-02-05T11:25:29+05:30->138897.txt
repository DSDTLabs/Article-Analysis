COIMBATORE: The city police has started the renovation work on Friday at the 80-year-old building located inside the police commissioner's office premises. 

 Special police wings including economic offences wing (EOW) unit-II, district crime branch, city crime branch and special intelligence cell (SIC) and rural prohibition enforcement wing (PEW) were shifted to other buildings from the 80-year-old building. Police officials said that the renovation work will be completed within three months.
 
 EOW unit-II wing was shifted to the rural armed reserve police administrative office building located at the   (PRS) campus on Dr Balasundaram road. 
 
 The EOW wing will now function on the first floor of the building. The district police said that they cannot allot space for EOW at the new district police office (DPO) premises on SBI Road. After the renovation work is completed, the city police commissioner will decide on allocating space for EOW in the 80-year-old building. 
 
 Meanwhile, the district crime branch (DCB) and rural PEW offices were shifted to the new DPO. All their computers and case records were also shifted to the new building. But the   officials have been instructed not to receive any petitions or conduct any inquiry at the new building, as constructed building is still waiting for the inauguration ceremony.
 
 SIC and the city crime branch was shifted to the fourth floor of the city police commissioner office premises. After renovation work, both the wings will be shifted back to the old building. 
 
 Police said that the 80-year-old building was constructed by British police officials. As the building was not maintained well, city police commissioner A Amalraj has taken to steps to renovate the old building.
