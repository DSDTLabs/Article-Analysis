BENGALURU: The drivers, who have been protesting against cab aggregators   and   for the past four days, were denied permission by police to hold a demonstration and hunger strike at   on KG Road. The drivers, who have been staying off the roads, alleged that they were denied their right to protest with no valid reason. 

 On Sunday, small groups of drivers were seen standing at the MG Road-Brigade Road Junction, near   and other spots with placards and coin boxes seeking donation to fight their cause. 
 
 "First, we approached   seeking permission, but he asked us to get the  's nod as the Bannappa Park is under its control. When we returned to him with the required clearance, he asked us to meet his senior officer. So we met additional commissioner of police (east) Malini Krishnamurthy, who told us to meet DCP (Central) Chandragupta. But the DCP said no venue was free until March 3. When we informed him about the BBMP's approval, he said the venue is out of question and he can't grant permission," an office-bearer of the cab drivers' union said. 
 
  Following this, some drivers hit th e streets with placards. 
 
  The drivers, who are firm on continuing with the agitation, said they want the government and the cab aggregators to resolve the issues, incl uding getting rid of dynamic pricing models, fixing of tariff and reducing the number of trips to get incentives, at the earliest. "The cab aggregators must stop penaliz ing drivers for cancellation of trips or other petty reasons. We have reached a stage where depending on the government too seems to be of no use," he added.
