MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has said that the list of changes in assignments for benches put out on Saturday, that resulted in the appeals in the   fake encounter case being assigned to a new judge, was routine. 

 "It is a usual change in assignments. Every two or three months, roster is changed. The acting chief justice is not supposed to know of each and every individual matter. The high court note is very clear that parties can approach the acting chief justice to treat the matter as part-heard and it can then be delegated to the same bench that is hearing the case," registrar general Shrinivas Agrawal told TOI on Monday. 
 
  TOI had reported on the change in assignments on Sunday. As per the new list, Justice Revati Mohite-Dere, who was hearing appeals in the case, has been assigned to hear bail and anticipatory bail applications. Justice Nitin Sambre has now been assigned criminal writ petitions and criminal revision applications, given earlier to Justice Mohite-Dere. So, according to the list, Sambre is supposed to hear the Sohrabuddin case. The next date of hearing for the case has not yet been updated on the HC website. Mohite-Dere is on leave till March 1, as per a notice issued on Monday.
