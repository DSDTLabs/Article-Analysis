NELLORE: In a tragic incident, a second year BTech (Mining) student from   - Dara Jai Bheem Raju (19) - allegedly set himself ablaze and then jumped to death from the S Ramanujan Hostel building at IIT-BHU in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. He is said to have taken the extreme step as he had been suffering from bouts of depression due to poor academic performance. However, no suicide note was found at the scene of offence. 

 Raju's friends immediately shifted him to   in the city where he was declared brought dead. A native of   village under Naidupet mandal in Nellore district, Raju was a second year B Tech (Mining) engineering. Raju's father D V Krishnaiah, a train ticket collector, received a phone call from his friends around 5 pm on Tuesday who informed him that his son had committed suicide. While Raju's friends in the hostel say that he had committed suicide owing to parental pressure, his father alleged that somebody was behind his son's death. He pointed out that his son was not a coward and that a third person is behind the death. Krishnaiah went on to say that no official of the college had spoken to him though 24 hours have elapsed since his son's death.
 
 While Raju's parents are in a state of shock, his relatives left for Varanasi on Wednesday to collect the body.
