RAJKOT: Rajkot Municipal Corporation ( ) will set up a new sewage treatment plant (STP) with capacity of processing 80 million litre per day (MLD) at Madhapar. This will increase the civic body’s installed STP capacity to nearly 170 MLD in couple of years. 

 Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel will lay foundation stone for the Rs 45.7 crore project at Madhapar on Sunday. The central government has approved 80   under the   (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation). The Centre will contribute 33% towards the project, while state’s share will be 37% and rest will be borne by the RMC. The new plant, with latest technology, will work according to new guidelines of the  .
 
 According to RMC officials, the new STP will be operational in next two years and untreated sewage from various parts of the city will be treated at the new facility.
 
 “With addition of the new plant, there will be no release of untreated sewage into Nyari (2) and Aji (2) dam,” the official said.
 
 “RMC’s current capacity of treating sewage water is 95.5 MLD as against the 170 MLD sewage generation. Because of lower capacity, untreated sewage water is dumped into Aji (2) and Nyari (2) dams. These two water bodies are contaminated due to effluent being released into them,” said an official. There are two existing STPs in the city—one at Madhapar (44.5 MLD) and another at Raiya (51 MLD).
 
 “If everything goes according to plan, RMC will have 316 MLD STP capacity by the end of 2018 and it will be able to treat all the sewage generated in the city. Since the population is increasing as the city’s limit expands, we need to have more STPs. The increased capacity will be sufficient for next 30 years,” said a senior RMC official.
