AMRITSAR: Punjab minister   has red-flagged Punjab Pollution Control Board’s (PPCB’s) analysis report of the Tung Bala Nullah flowing through Amritsar, saying that the board undervalued effluent levels in the drain.

 Sidhu demanded an inquiry into the procedure used for preparing the analysis report and that officials behind it be held acccountable. “I will take up the issue in assembly and discuss it with the chief minister,” Sidhu said.
 
 Sidhu, who was speaking to journalists at his home in Amritsar on Saturday, said the central government-funded National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), after it signed a memorandum of understanding with Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company (PMIDC), was given the task of rejuvenating a 2.2km stretch of the drain. 
 
 He said the PPCB’s report claimed that only 12 industries were discharging treated water into the nullah and this was within permissible limits.
 
 Sidhu said   Limited (ASCL), however, noticed that there were some small-scale soap industries, apart from the 12 factories mentioned by PPCB, also discharging effluents into the drain and this could affect NEERI’s technology. “A letter was written to   but its reply was still awaited,” he said.
 
 He said NEERI also took samples from the drain and the results showed that effluent levels were much higher than those mentioned in PPCB’s report. “Under these circumstances, NEERI could, at most, achieve 50% reduction of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values,” he said. PMIDC and NEERI signed the agreement in February this year. It is aimed at water and wastewater treatment, water bodies’ rejuvenation, solid-waste management, sludge treatment, urban ecosystem design, and capacity building in environment planning for architects, engineers and planners.
