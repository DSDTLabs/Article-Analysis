Surat: An employee of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) fled with Rs87.20 lakh taken from a person for allotment of 80 EWS and 16 LIG houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to him and others.  Twenty-six-year-old Sandip Anghad in his complaint registered at Chowk Bazaar police station said that he had given Rs87,20,000 in a period of two years to Rohit Solanki, who works in the ward office of SMC at Panas, for allotment of 80 economically weaker section (EWS) and 16 low income group (LIG) houses from Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to him and others.  Solanki had promised Anghad that he would ensure that the flats are allotted to him and others in the draw and kept on taking money from him for the past two years. When the flats were not allotted in his name, Anghad realized that he has been cheated and demanded his money back. Solanki had threatened to commit suicide if a police complaint was lodged against him, but Anghad went ahead and submitted his complaint to police on May 4.  Police officials said the accused has fled the city but they would nab him soon. The accused has been booked under IPC sections 406, 420, 504 and 506(2).
