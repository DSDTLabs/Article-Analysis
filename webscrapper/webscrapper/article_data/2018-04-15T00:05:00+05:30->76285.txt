Few things in life call for absolutely no effort. Like the no-fuss-messy or straight-out-of-bed hairstyle. Or so you’d think. Getting the dishevelled look is not that easy. Too messy and you’ll look sloppy, too styled and it will beat the purpose. Here’s what to keep in mind...
 
 
  If you use the wet product, you’ll end up losing the out-of-bed nature of this style. Pick a matte clay/wax. To know what would suit you best, is to try and try, till you arrive upon the best. Apply the product roughly, not in a certain direction/way.
 
 
 No matter what length you’re going for, a trim every month will make your mop manageable.
 
 
 Messy manes behave and look their best after a quick towel-dry, as you can see their natural texture. To tame it a little, use a low heat setting on your dryer – and just use your fingers to comb it. 
 
 
 To turn up the volume, shorten your sides. Creating contrasts is a cheat-sheet to looking one’s best. With short hair on the side, play with the volume in the centre.
