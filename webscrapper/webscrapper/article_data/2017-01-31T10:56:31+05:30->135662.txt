GUWAHATI:   and now a  ,  , took over as the 20th   on Monday after being elected to the post unopposed. 

 Goswami, a legal expert and a warhorse in parliamentary affairs, said, "I will work independently to uphold democratic values. My aim will be to not adjourn the House when differences arise. I will use the discretionary power of the chair in such times." 
 
 Goswami (58) is representing the Jorhat constituency for the fourth time since he made his electoral debut in 1991 on an AGP ticket. He is the third legislator to from the prestigious constituency to assume the post of the assembly speaker, after Debeswar Sarmah (March 1946 to October 1947) and Kuladhar Chaliha (March 1952 to June 1957). The speaker's post had fallen vacant after Goswami's predecessor Ranjeet Kumar Dass, elected as the speaker at the beginning of the current assembly last June, quit after he was appointed president of BJP's state unit. The veteran choked while delivering his thanksgiving speech, referring to the two developments in his family as having taken place "according to the wishes of the almighty" - his elder brother Jitendra Nath Goswami being conferred the Padma Shri and his election as speaker of the assembly.
