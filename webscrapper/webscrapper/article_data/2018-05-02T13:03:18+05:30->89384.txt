HYDERABAD: The   on Tuesday issued notices to the state of AP, its endowments principal secretary, commissioner and the executive officer of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), asking them to explain the rationale behind their action in depositing 1,000 crore of TTD funds in IndusInd Bank, Tirupati. 

 The bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice K   was hearing a public interest petition filed by P Naveen Kumar Reddy, a resident of Tirupati, questioning the decision of the TTD EO in depositing the fund of the temple in a private bank. Jakkula Sridhar, the counsel for the petitioner, urged the bench to direct the state to frame certain guidelines to be followed by temples and other cash-surplus institutions while depositing cash in banks. He also brought to the notice of the court that the TTD had never made its deposits in private banks in the past. 
 
 As of now, under the available rules under the Endowments Act and its section 111, the funds have to be deposited only in nationalised banks. The whims and fancies of the EOs have no place in the scheme of the Act, he said. The bench also questioned the TTD counsel as to why the temple chose this particular private bank (IndusInd Bank). The bench also issued notice to Indus Ind Bank in Tirupati, seeking reply within four weeks. 
 
 The bench, in a separate development, closed the PIL that questioned the appointment of Putta Sudhakar as TTD chairman. It was brought to the notice of the bench that the petitioners, Omkar and two others, have filed another plea before the court with the same prayer. The bench closed this case and said it would take up that plea when it comes up for hearing.
