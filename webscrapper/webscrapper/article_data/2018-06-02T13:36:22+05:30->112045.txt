Musician  , who is coming back with the boy band -   - alongwith Karan Oberoi, Danny Fernandes and  , said the trend of remaking old songs is infuriating.

 Sherrin told in a statement: "  is currently trending on remakes of old songs in new movies so that the music labels who hold the rights to these songs can rely on the recall value of the song from yesteryear's airplay and hope that the new version with a new verse catches on without much marketing spend thereby drawing attention and generating box office revenue for the film."
 
  
  
 "This is an infuriating trend because most noteworthy music directors are being asked to do so by the producers of the film who in turn are being forced by rogue music labels to do so or leave the film. In my opinion this will pass as it's a matter of time before people need new material," he added. 
 
 Prior to the formation of 'A Band of Boys' in 2001, which at the time had Karan,  ,   and Chint2, Sherrin featured on a hit TV show. 
 
 He has also featured in Malayalam film   in 2015.
