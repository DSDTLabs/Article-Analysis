NEW DELHI: The Centre faulted the grant of recognition to 23 private medical colleges by the Supreme Court-appointed Justice R M Lodha oversight committee on Wednesday and sought its disbanding, saying the   Bill was in the offing to regulate the field. 

  Additional solicitor general Maninder Singh asked a bench of Justices J Chelameswar, R K Agrawal and Abdul Nazeer for disbanding the   on medical education. He cited the controversy relating to grant of recognition to 23 medical colleges despite the   rejecting their pleas due to deficiencies in infrastructure. 
 
  Singh said 34 medical colleges were under the scanner. But the oversight committee granted them conditional permission to admit students, a situation unknown in medical education, he said. In deference to the Lodha panel, the government granted conditional approval to the 34 medical colleges on their submitting a bank guarantee of Rs 2 crore each accompanied by an undertaking that they would rectify the deficiencies. 
 
  However, despite the undertakings, the inspectors found 32 of them had not rectified the deficiencies, Singh said. "The oversight committee still decided to grant permission to 23 of the 32 colleges." The bench referred the matter to the five-judge bench that set up the Lodha panel.
