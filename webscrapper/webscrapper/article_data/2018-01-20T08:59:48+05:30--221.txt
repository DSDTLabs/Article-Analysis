PUNE: The Akhil Bharat Krushi Goseva Sangh on Friday extended   to   who has been booked for instigation of violence at Koregaon Bhima on January 1. 

 Representatives of organizations working for the protection of cows said Ekbote has been falsely implicated and he has no role in the violence. Ekbote never entertained caste and community divide, they said.
 
 Ekbote, who heads Samasta Hindu Aghadi, and Sambhaji Bhinde of the  , have been booked by the Pune rural police for the January 1 violence. 
 
 The representatives claimed that Ekbote has been active in gau-raksha (protection of cows) for years and implicating him in the violence was a part of a political move by people opposed to his work. The government should not target Ekbote and Bhide, the organizations said.
 
 The sangh claimed Ekbote’s efforts led to the protection of over 25,000 cows and confiscation of beef. 
 
 Bhagvan   Maharaj of Maharashtra Warkari Sampraday said warkaris backed Ekbote and they would take a strong stand if his name was not cleared. 
 
 “We will not allow the chief minister to perform any puja during   procession if Ekbote faces charges,” Kokare said. Prithviraj Bothra of Pune Panjarpol Trust said Ekbote for many years and he cannot instigate violence.
 
 The women’s wing of Samasta Hindu Aghadi, recently submitted a letter to the rural police seeking a detailed inquiry into the January 1 violence. They demanded that no action be taken against Ekbote till the probe was complete.
