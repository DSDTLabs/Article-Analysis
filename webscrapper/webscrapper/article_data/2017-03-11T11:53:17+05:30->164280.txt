PALAKKAD: The   headed by N S Sojon, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Narcotic Cell, has arrested two more persons in connection with the   of two   on Friday taking the number of arrested in the case to four. 

 According to the police,   (27), a cousin of the victims and a neighbour --   (30) of Cherthala -- were arrested under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and other relevant sections of the criminal procedure code, the police said.
 
 They said that there is evidence regarding sexual abuse of girls by the accused persons. On Thursday, the police had arrested Madhu, another close relative of the deceased girls and Shibu, a close friend of the father of the deceased girls.
 
 The police team which initially investigated the case has been accused of wilfully suppressing findings in the post-mortem report which pointed towards evidence of unnatural sex and the possibility of the girls being raped. The police had tried to write off deaths of both the girls as suicide and this was a violation of the provisions of the IPC, the Cr.P.C and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.
 
 The surgeons who had conducted post-mortem examination in their note to the police had directed sending the samples for chemical examination.
 
 The note said that even if the chemical examination results were found negative the chances of rape cannot be ruled out because there was swelling and infection on the private part of the elder girl.
 
 There were also injuries found on her body. Yet in both the cases the police stood by the suicide theory.
 
 The statement by the mother that the girls were abused was also not considered by them.
