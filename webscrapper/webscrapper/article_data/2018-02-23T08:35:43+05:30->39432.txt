 UP CM Yogi Adityanath said, “I have seen Dudhwa myself. No other forest in the country is as rich. It is home to birds, deer, tigers. Animals can be sighted at every kilometre.”
 
 Officials said that the CM is convinced that the 100 km train ride would be a delight. The heritage train will run at a maximum speed of 15 km per hour to avert any possibility of fatal accidents involving wildlife. Tourists can stay in Rajasthanlike five star cottages to gather a lifetime experience.
