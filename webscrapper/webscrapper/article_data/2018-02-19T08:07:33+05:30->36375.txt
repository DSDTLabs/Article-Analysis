LUDHIANA: A scuffle broke out between workers of the   and the   (LIP) at a house in Model Town Extension here on Sunday, following which leaders on either side levelled allegations of intimidation and violence against each other. 

 Even as leaders of the two parties traded charges, police did not register a case and dismissed the entire incident as a "minor issue". While LIP leader and MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains said Congress workers entered the house of one Ashok Singla and threatened him and his leaders with firearms, Congress leader   said they had reached the house for a meeting which had been arranged earlier and Bains and his party workers pushed them out, and all they tried to do was defend themselves. 
 
 Bains said he was sitting in Singla's house when  , son of the Congress candidate from Ward 49, came there. "Singla asked Gogi to leave. But, after some time, Gogi and Congress's halqa in charge for Atam Nagar, Kanwaljeet Karwal, returned along with some workers. They were armed with a revolver," he said.
 
 When contacted, Karwal said they had a meeting fixed at Singla's house at 4pm. "But when we reached, Bains was already there. After we saw him, we came out. However, his party workers tried to push us out and we tried to save ourselves, as anyone would," Karwal said.
 
 Bains said Congress leaders and workers indulged in vandalism inside the drawing room and caught hold of his neck and manhandled him. On the other hand, the Congress claimed that the LIP leader tried to intimidate them. "We don't indulge in such stunts," Karwal said.
 
 Ludhiana police commissioner   said tthe house owner said it was a minor issue and he did not want to lodge a complaint.
