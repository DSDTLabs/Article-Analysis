NAGPUR: As the distance between home and   is getting longer, students are finding it difficult to reach the centres on time during exams. In some cases, the students are residing on the outskirts while in other the exam centre is outside city limits. Hence, the National Students’ Union India (NSUI) has demanded the exam centre should be only 2 km away from colleges.

 A   on Tuesday met vice chancellor SP Kane and pro-VC  . They apprised them about the difficulties students were facing during exams. 
 
 “The distance of exam centre and student’s college is getting as long as 8 to 10km. Students are facing different types of problems on their way and basic facilities too are lacking at such far off exam centres. Students are wasting at least two hours in travelling,” NSUI stated. 
 
 BE final year student of Anjuman College Ayushi Choudhary said, “We generally get exam centre on   or Koradi Road. I stay in Anant Nagar but many of our classmates are from Besa and east parts of the city. Katol Road is quite accident prone. We need to leave our homes two hours prior to the exam. This leaves us exhausted because of travelling. Both winter and summer seasons pose their own sets of problems and add to exam anxiety.”
 
 Besides, NSUI also wants the NU to start ‘book bank’ from the New Year.
