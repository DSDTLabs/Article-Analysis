She said, “My friend’s email account got hacked first. This guy was talking to me for many days. And then, he hacked my email account, which had scanned copies of important documents and also information regarding my bank accounts. I registered a complaint and though my email account was retrieved in a few days, my friend’s is yet to be retrieved. Fearing that the hacker might have access to my bank accounts, I had to take many precautionary measures. The police were very supportive, and we came to know later that the hacker was from Pakistan.”
