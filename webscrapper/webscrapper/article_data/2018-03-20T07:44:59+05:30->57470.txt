AHMEDABAD: What are the common distractions you encounter while driving your vehicle? Checking an update or instructing someone on your phone, frequently  ,   that passes by, listening to loud stereo or  . If you are more prone to these, then you should opt for a crash course on concentration as many like you are the real danger for innocent road users!

 A recent study on accidents on Ahmedabad roads between January and July last year has revealed that in almost 44% accidents a pedestrian or a two-wheeler rider was knocked down after the driver lost attention. In 27% of the cases the most likely victim was a pedestrian. In nearly 16% of the accidents, injuries could have been avoided if the driver had worn seat belts, while in 18% cases road injuries were reported after commuters or even pedestrians lost concentration and became victims. The study was conducted by JP Research India last year and the report has been submitted to Gujarat’s transport commissioner. The report also reveals that of the 850 accidents that were analysed nearly 26% involved cars.
 
 “Some prefer to ride on the fast lane at slower speeds. I have seen how drivers continue to talk on their phones while the light turns green, overspeeding of vehicles at intersections just when the lights are about to turn red. Many of us take road usage aptitude tests before procuring licences, but never adhere to it,” says a senior AMC official of the traffic department. The official also said that in places like Naroda, Isanpur, Vatva, Amraiwadi, Bapunagar, Sola and Gota areas most accidents occur due to overloading of vehicles.
