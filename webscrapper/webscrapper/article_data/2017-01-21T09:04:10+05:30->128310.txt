SHIMLA: For the first time, a film made in a Himachali dialect “Saanjh” gets international recognition by grabbing best feature film award at international Borrego Springs Film Festival held in California, US, on January 16, beating 750 other nominated films from across the globe. 

 Film director and producer Ajay Saklani hails from Mandi district. He told TOI that he is happy to receive such an honour. In spite of more than 100 years of the Indian cinema, Himachal Pradesh had failed to make its mark in film-making at both national as well as international levels. “Saanjh, a Himachali feature film finally breaks this jinx and has brought laurels to the state by bagging two international awards. The best film award was received at the festival by film’s co-producer Anil Chandel. Prior to this, the film also received award of merit at the Accolade Global Film Competition, California, US. The movie will now be screened at Bayou Film Festival, Louisiana, US, on January 26 and will be released in India soon.”
