VIENNA: Focused reforms unleashed by the   government in the last three years have halved the rate at which power prices rose every year and improved India's position in global 'ease of getting electricity' ranking.

 The compounded annual growth in power prices in the 2014-16 period stood at 3.27% against 5.94% through the last 10 years between 2004 and 2014.
 
 Simultaneously during the last two years, India has also moved up to the 26th spot in the World Bank's electricity accessibility ranking in 2017 from 99th spot in 2014, aided largely by the   government's rural   programme in the last three years since it came to power.
 
 Nowhere has the success of the government's policies become more visible than Wednesday's development where solar power tariff went below coal-fired power for a project at Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan. 
 
 Overall energy shortage too has come down to 0.7% at present from 4.2% in 2014.
 
 No wonder power, coal renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal spoke from a position of strength when he told the   Energy Forum, "Many problems had earlier set India back for many years but now the mood has changed."
 
 "India is taking rapid strides in terms of commitment and target for promoting energy conservation and efficiency," he said giving the world an insight into the PM's energy plan for the country.
 
 "Traditionally India's stand has been what the world was ready to do to help us go green. Finally, we are able to tell the world that we will do whatever it takes to improving our pollution levels to meet the challenges of climate change, irrespective of what the world does. We have finally been able to make solar tariff go below grid parity... India's leadership position in green energy will new benefit the world," he said.
 
 Total power capacity increased by nearly a third (31%) from 243GW in March 2014 to 320 GW in March 2017.
 
 In spite of the Modi government's plan to set up 175 GW geeen power capacity by 2022, conventional power generation capacity too has increased by 26% from 214 GW in March 2014 to 270 GW in March 2017.
