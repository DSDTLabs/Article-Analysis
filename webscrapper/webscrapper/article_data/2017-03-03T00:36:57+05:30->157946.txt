A squad of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the murder of Communist leader   in Kolhapur in February 2015, questioned  , the founder of ultra-right wing outfit Sanatan Sanstha, and his aides at the organization’s headquarters in Goa.

 The SIT squad has been camping in Goa since Tuesday as part of an ongoing search for wanted suspects Vinay Pawar and Sarang Akolkar. The two are also wanted in the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar in August 2013 in Pune. The Bombay high court is monitoring investigations by the SIT and the CBI in the two cases. State CID’s additional director-general of police Sanjay Kumar, who is heading the SIT, told TOI that an extensive search operation has been launched across Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka for tracing Pawar and Akolkar.
 
 He said, the questioning of Athavale and other ashram members was also for seeking more information about Sanatan Sanstha member Virendrasinh Tawde, the lone suspect arrested so far in Pansare as well as Dabholkar murder cases.
 
 “We quizzed Athavale, and others with regards to the whereabouts of Pawar and Akolkar, who have been identified as assailants in both the murder cases. The two wanted suspects are on the run for quite some time and we are taking every effort to arrest them,” Kumar said. Pawar and Akolkar are suspected of have fired at Pansare on the morning of February 20, 2015 while he was returning home from a morning walk along with his wife, Uma. “The two suspects are likely to be hiding in some ashram or religious place in Maharshtra or Goa or Karnataka and our efforts are focussed on these places. We are also not ruling out the possibility of these two suspects having altered their appearance and looks to evade the police,” Kumar said. 
 
 On Wednesday, the CBI had announced Rs 5 lakh reward each for anyone providing clues about Pawar and Akolkar.
