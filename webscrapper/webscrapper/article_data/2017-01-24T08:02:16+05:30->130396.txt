GURUGRAM: Monday was the last day for filing objections and suggestions on the delimitation of wards for the upcoming  . But the district administration said it has received only 46 objections and suggestions, and that too, mostly from RWAs claiming that development might get adversely affected. RWA of Sector 23A has, however, threatened to boycott the civic elections if their boundary is not redrawn.

 “In all, we have received 46 objections and suggestions during the 10-day period that was given to residents to file their feedback. We will address their complaints by January 30. We will try to include as many suggestions as we can. The ad hoc committee that redrew the boundaries seems to have done a good job due to which the complaints are few in number,” said  , additional deputy commissioner, Gurugram.
 
 Unhappy with delimitation process, Bhawani Shankar Tripathy, general secretary of Sector 23A RWA, said, “The way our ward (ward number 2) has been delimited, we strongly suspect vested political motivation. Sector 23&23A are integral parts of a single Huda sector with sequential house numbering that appears in both sectors, and thus both form one common area and should remain together. But Sector 23A has been proposed in ward 2, whereas Sector 23 in ward 3, thus dividing the sector into two parts.”
 
 “Also, there are many unauthorised colonies in ward 2. As a developed Huda sector, we strongly refuse to be included in the same ward with so many unauthorised colonies. Unless our objections are considered and the boundaries of ward 2 are redrawn, residents of Sector 23A will boycott the municipal elections,” he added.
 
 The Khattar government has been forced to expedite the MCG election process, following a order by the Punjab and   to hold the polls by mid-March. The election was supposed to be held in May last year.
