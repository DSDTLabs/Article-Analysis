PATNA: Apparently worried over reports of rampant smuggling of liquor, the Patna district administration on Friday announced cash rewards for information on liquor smuggling in the district.
 
  A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the district civil and police officials, chaired by DM  , at the district collectorate earlier in the day. Patna SSP   also attended the meeting.
  
  The reward amount has not been announced yet.
  
  The DM and the SSP directed the officials to pro-actively prevent smuggling of liquor at any cost. “The district officials’ meeting was a follow-up exercise after CM Nitish Kumar’s review meeting on the issue at his residence on Thursday,” said a district official.
  
  According to Patna district public relations officer  , ten raiding teams have been formed to conduct raids after receiving tip-offs and on suspicion. Also, a control room will remain functional round the clock, to which information about liquor smuggling can be given at phone number 0612-2219293 and WhatsApp number 94734 00608.
  
  All the station house officers of police stations in the district will have to give a fresh undertaking that liquor smuggling is not taking place under their jurisdiction, Sahay said.
