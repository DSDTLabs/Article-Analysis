HYDERABAD: In less than a decade, a US-educated man, who had declared an annual income of RS 3.2 lakh in 2009-10, has allegedly amassed properties worth hundreds of crores without any steady income. His meteoric rise is courtesy his brother-in-law, HMDA director, planning, K  , who was arrested in a disproportionate assets (DA) case.

 
 Like his brother-in-law, US-returned B  , the alleged benami of Purushottam Reddy, is non cooperative with ACB sleuths during interrogation. The sleuths, questioning Srinivas Reddy, said he is loyal to Purushottam Reddy and telling them that he was not a benami of the HMDA official. However, he was not able to explain how he managed to purchase assets worth hundreds of crores in his name. 
  
 
 Srinivas Reddy has been named accused in two cases registered by the ACB. Apart from the DA case registered against Purushottam Reddy, Srinivas has been named an accused in the criminal misconduct case registered against the HMDA director on March 3 for obtaining a flat in the residential apartments project built by   in Kondapur for lesser price by allegedly misusing the latter’s official position. ACB officials alleged that Srinivas Reddy was the main benamidar and during the interrogation, they have posed questions asking him to explain how he managed to purchase several assets, including a 3031-sft flat at Kondapur without any steady income source.
 
 Though Srinivas Reddy kept on reiterating that all the assets he ‘owns’ including the flat in Kondapur, villas in Manchirevula and a villa in Kokapet were his own, he did not explain about source of his income.
 
 “In 2009-10, Srinivas Reddy’s annual income was ?3.2 lakh and he could not explain how he managed to purchase all the assets in his name worth over ?7.5 crore as per documentary value,” said an ACB official. After questioning Srinivas Reddy for one more day, ACB sleuths would produce him in court on Tuesday.
