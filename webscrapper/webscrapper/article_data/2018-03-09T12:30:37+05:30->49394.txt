NAGPUR: In order to reduce power consumption in   stations and offices,   has decided to install highly efficient high volume low speed (HVLS) ceiling fans. This will save 2.31 lakh units of electricity per annum in every Metro station.

 A MahaMetro official said that to achieve similar type of velocity at each Metro rail platform with 8 HVLS fans having 10 feet diameter, the agency will require 144 wall-mounted fans, as one wall-mounted fan covers 150 sq.ft area. HVLS fans will thus save over 2 lakh units per annum.
 
 HVLS fans utilize a D-Drive next-generation DC motor that eliminates the need for a gearbox, which reduces noise and moving parts. They are 10 feet in diameter, with a variable speed of 0 to 93.5 revolutions per minute (RPM) and maximum displacement of up to 34,000 cubic feet per minute (CFM). One fan can serve an area up to 2,700 sq. ft, with very low sound level (up to 44 dba at 100% speed).
 
 These HVLS fans are very much energy efficient and each fan uses maximum power of up to 190 watts only. Its next-generation motor design eliminates gearbox, resulting in reduced noise, zero maintenance and easy installation. Hence, these fans can provide saving in capital, maintenance and energy costs too.
 
 HVLS fans shall enhance thermal comfort by reduction in effective air temperature by about 5.7 degree F. They will be wired into the buildingâ€™s fire suppression system so that the fans will automatically shut off maximum of 90 seconds after sprinklers are activated. Upon fire detection as described above, the fans shall coast to a stop as required by   guidelines.
