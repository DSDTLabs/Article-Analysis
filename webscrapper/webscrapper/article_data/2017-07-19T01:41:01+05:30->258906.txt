MUMBAI: Five passengers lost their bags and purses containing cellphones, cash and jewellery, on the New Delhi-Mumbai Central   Express recently.

  and his wife, who were among those who lost their belongings, have lodged an FIR. The incident took place on July 18 reportedly between Ratlam and Baroda. Ali, who was travelling with his wife in A-1 coach, said, “When we woke up near Surat around 5.40am, a bag that was with my wife was missing. She was sleeping on the lower berth number 21. Two mobiles, cash and jewellery, collectively worth Rs 1.93 lakh, were gone.”
 
 Sayyed, a member of the Hindi advisory committee of the railway board, informed the train superintendent about the theft and came to know that a couple of other passengers too had lodged complaints about finding their bags, containing cellphones, jewellery and cash, missing. The other passengers whose bags were stolen were MD Chaudhury, Shanta Datta, Priti Singh and Charu Lata.
 
 Sayed claimed that though they informed the train superintendent at 6am, their statements were recorded only at 9.30am. He said that when he tried to call up on his lost cellphone, it was ringing and alerted the superintendent. “The staff did not show any urgency in informing the police so that the phone’s location could be traced.”
 
 “Later, some of the empty purses were found near the shelf where pantry car operators keep food. The pantry car staff could have a role in the thefts,” he said. 
 
 CR’s chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, “Based on call records, the location of Sayyed’s handset was traced near Halol in Gujarat. The GRP in Vadodara has been asked to probe the theft cases.” Officials will also scan footage of CCTV cameras installed at stations on Rajdhani’s route.
 
 “Usually, my wife gets up couple of times in the night but on that day she did not. We suspect it to be an inside job. They must have spiked out food,” said Sayyed.
