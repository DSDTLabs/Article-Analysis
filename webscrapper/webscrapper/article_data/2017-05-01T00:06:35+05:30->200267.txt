New Delhi:   and children can now use washrooms of any hotel or restaurant located in south Delhi for free. The initiative, announced in February 2017, was delayed due to municipal elections.

 The restaurants association of India and hoteliers welcomed the decision, saying they stood for the dignity of women. Initially, the idea was to allow everybody to use these  , but the proposal was tweaked on the insistence of restaurateurs. 
 
 Commenting on the move, Riyaaz Amlani, president of Restaurants Association of India, said: “The lack of a sufficient number of public toilets at marketplaces inconveniences women, hence the move.” 
 
 There are around 35,000 restaurants and hotels in south Delhi. An SDMC official said: “We have renewed our commitment to PM’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The facility will be reviewed after feedback from all concerned,” the official said.
 
 The move comes following instructions from LG Anil Baijal to the civic body to give access to toilets of restaurants and hotels for free, keeping in view safety of women. A series of meetings between corporation officials and representatives of restaurants and hotels’ association ensued. 
 
 Restaurants will now display a notice outside their establishments that their toilets are available for free use by women and children. Sarika Agnihotry, a management professional, welcomed the move: “It is a great decision because public places have insufficient number of toilets.”
