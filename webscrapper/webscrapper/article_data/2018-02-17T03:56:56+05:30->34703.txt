GURUGRAM: A 26-year-old woman on Friday wrote an open letter to   chief minister   calling his pro-women initiatives a hoax, alleging inaction in a   complaint she had lodged earlier this month.

 The woman had on February 4 moved police against the owner and two other officials of hotel Bids Private Limited Company for mentally and sexually harassing her. The woman said the hotel manager, Sunil Bhardwaj, the owner, Inder Sharma, and another associate Rikki Sharma would make passes at her when she used to work at the hotel. 
 
 “I suspect cops are trying to help the accused to wriggle out. The slogan of Beti Bacahao-Beti Padhao is a myth in your state where women are harassed and cannot even hope for justice... If you can’t give me justice I will have to move to PM Narender Modi,” read her letter. The woman had told police that when she was working at the hotel, she had asked for a raise as her salary had not been hiked for a while, but in response she was asked by the accused what she could offer them in return for the hike. She had quit her job after they allegedly threatened to kill her when she rejected their advances. 
 
 “We are verifying the facts and the action will be taken as per the law,” said Poonam Hudda, SHO, Women police station, where the FIR had been lodged.
