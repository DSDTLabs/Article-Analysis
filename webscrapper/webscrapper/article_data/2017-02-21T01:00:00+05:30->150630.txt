Famous psychologist   once said, “The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the   soul, is ‘What does a   want?’” This is undoubtedly the one big perennial conundrum on most men’s minds. While there can be many answers to this as woman may want or need varied things through their lives — some chocolate, a tender hug, indulgent   or more, men would definitely like to stay ahead by knowing what’s on their better halves’ minds. Here are easy ways to seek inroads into her personal space…

 
 This one matters the most. By doing that, you’re showing her that you are definitely interested. She’s bound to let you in on her thoughts if she sees you interested.
 
 That’s right. Most men complain that their girlfriends aren’t saying enough about their feelings, but what if they’re the ones not really listening? It’s possible she’s saying more to you and you’re so busy looking at her hair, face or at a menu that her words or cues just slip by? Between 70-80 % of what we convey to each other is communicated non-verbally. 
 
 
 Ask if she’s more of a museum or long-drive-in-the-city person and do that on a date. Also, casually check with her about the kind of clothes she likes and use the tip to dress that way. Chances are, you will please her if you do and know what she likes. 
 
 
 Women do not need a man who can go on and on about an ex girlfriend, how much he was a party animal before she came along or talk about how much he depends on others. They want a man who can make his decisions and someone who is sensitive and steady.
 
 
 A woman wants space to make her own decisions. Yes, you may be in her life, but you cannot start to take over all aspects of it.
