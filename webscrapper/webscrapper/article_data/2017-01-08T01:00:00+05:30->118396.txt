'Ek ladka aur ek ladki kabhi dost nahi ho sakte' — guess this popular dialogue from the 90s hit ' ' continues to haunt our celebs. 
Rumours of   finding love again have been doing the rounds for quite sometime now. The actress is supposedly dating Delhi-based singer-turned-actor  , who is all set to make his television debut with the show 'Ek Vivah Aisa Bhi'. Rumours started when the two were 
 spotted together at the recent   concert in Mumbai and pictures of them hanging out with friends at Gauahar’s residence went viral.
 While   denied the link-up, calling it completely “baseless”, Gauahar is upset that the society can’t let a boy and girl be friends. She said, “It’s a joke… Can’t a girl and boy be friends? Boyfriend-girlfriend is not the only relationship in the world. Gossip bloggers need to get a life. Rupin is just a friend, we are not dating.” 
 Rupin added, “They linked us because we went to a concert together? Can’t friends be spotted together at a concert? She is my senior and a good friend. I am focusing on my career and looking forward to newer beginnings in my life.”
