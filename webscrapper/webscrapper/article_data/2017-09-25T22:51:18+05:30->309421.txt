DEHRADUN: In a faux pas that has left the state government red-faced, Union panchayati raj minister Narendra Singh Tomar recently wrote a letter to the state panchayati raj minister regarding the fortnight-long Swachhta campaign to commemo-rate the third anniversary of Swachh Bharat Mission on October 2.   However, he addressed it to Pritam Singh who handled the panchayati raj department during the previous Congress regime and is presently the state chief of the Congress party. Currently, the minister in charge of the panchayati raj department is BJP’s Arvind Pandey. It seems the Union minister had forgotten that his own party is now in power in the state.    The letter dated September 17, a copy of which is with TOI, has been duly signed by Tomar, who reiterates Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for sanitation and cleanliness and urges Singh’s department to “carry out efforts to make this campaign a success.” “You are requested to lead the campaign and keep villages clean through the support of NGOs, people and students.” the letter says.    The minister goes on to mention about the number of campaigns that are being run by the Centre for the welfare of villagers as well as “the pledge that has been taken to maintain cleanliness as per the vision of Mahatma Gandhi.” State govern-ment representatives could not be reached for their comments on the matter.
