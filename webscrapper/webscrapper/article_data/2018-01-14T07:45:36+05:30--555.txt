AHMEDABAD: One fails to comprehend if the   involve  , then why do our road designs and planning not factor in ways to reduce this conflict? A road safety research agency recently analysed threadbare cases of 137 registered accidents in the city to understand the situation of these accidents. The agency   found that collision between vehicles and pedestrians, contribute to 21% of all accidents and 22% of fatal or serious injury accidents.

 This is followed by accidents involving two wheelers and bicyclistswho either sustain injuries due to skidding and falling off the vehicles. Another set of accidents involve “collision between turning and crossing vehicles”, which together both contributed 19% of all accidents and 19% of fatal or seriousinjury accidents.
 
 The agency had analysed accidents for the period of January to December in 2016. A distribution by contributing factors like citizens, vehicles and infrastructure for 156 accidents showed that “human factors solely had an influence for 46% on the occurrence of accidents, followed by the combination of human and infrastructure factors which had an influence of 41% on the occurrence of accidents.”
  
  
 The report further added, “Human related factors solely or in combination had an influence of 92% in the accident occurrence while infrastructure factors were solely or in combination had an influence of 46% in the accident occurrence.”
 
 
 “Most roads in the city are designedfor particular speedlimits. Boardsinforming thespeed limits are mandatorily erected on road medians and even footpaths, but people do not obey them,” says  , a civil engineer with a private road construction firm. He adds, “Our national highways for instance are designed for a speed of 100 kmph and most have speed limit of 90 kmph. These are not followed and people hit 140-150 kmph while driving their SUVs. Being sensitive towards road minorities istheonly wayto reduce accidents,” says Sanjan.
