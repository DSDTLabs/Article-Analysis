Greater Noida: The   is all set to file a caveat at the National Company Law   demanding that it shall be heard first in   admitted before it. The caveat is likely to be filed next week.

 According to   officials, realtors of Greater Noida owe the Authority more than Rs 4,300 crore. Of the 102 projects termed “critical” in Greater Noida, 49 projects comprising approximately 50,000 units are those where builders have not only defaulted on payments to GNIDA but also on delivery of flats to homebuyers. The rest 53 projects have nearly one lakh residential units. Here the work is at a standstill even though the projects have been launched. With many builders in financial trouble, the future could see admittance of insolvency petitions before the NCLT, officials said.
 
 Besides, many banks could also approach the NCLT to recover their dues from defaulting builders. “Since Greater Noida Authority is the land owner of all properties in its area, the first right to recover dues is ours. Also, thousands of homebuyers have invested their hard-earned money in several projects. We need to protect the interest of homebuyers as well as recover dues,” said a GNIDA official. “Hence we’re thinking of filing a caveat before NCLT. 
 
 We’re seeking legal opinion in the matter and will soon take a decision,” he added.
