PATNA:   students boycotted the 91st foundation day celebrations of the college held on Monday to press for their demands, including hike in scholarship and stipend and removal of the dean.

 A second-year PG student claimed all the college students boycotted the function. To escape embarrassment, the college administration called 30 students from the Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Dairy Technology at Patna to attend the function, he alleged.
 
 A fourth-year under-graduate student said the college failed to fulfil even the basic necessities of students. “We have been protesting for months, but the dean never listens to our pleas. He rather threatened that he would stop our monthly stipend, which is a measly Rs 1,800. In other veterinary colleges of the country, under-graduate students get up to Rs 7,000 each and PG students Rs 10,000 each as stipend,” he said.
 
 Dean S  , however, denied the boycott. “Why shall we call students from outside to our college function?” he asked.
 
 On the demand for hike in scholarship and stipend, Samantray said it was not in his hand. “I submitted a proposal in this regard to the academic council of the university in 2017 and it was approved also by the board of management of the university. But its implementation will take time as it is done by the state government,” he said.
 
 The college, a constituent unit of  , turned 91 on April 2. On the occasion, it launched two teleservices – Kisan Call Centre (0162-2227258) and Animal Helpline Centre (0162-2227257). The college administration also felicitated Darbhanga-based dairy farmer   and ‘bater’ trader Jitendra Kumar of Bhojpur on the occasion.
