DEHRADUN: People of Uttarakhand should be ready to face the brunt of a high-magnitude earthquake, seismic experts warned on Friday while asserting that most parts of the hill state either lie in zone five or zone five seismic map of India.
 
  The hill state has been rocked by several low intensity tremors in the past few months. However, there was no report of any damage to property or to life.
  
  The revelation was made during a day-long workshop on earthquake risk assessment, organised by   (DMMC) at Dehradun on Friday. Several seismic experts from IIT Roorkee and other agencies took part in it.
  
  Addressing the participants, Kamal, who is a senior earth scientist at IIT Roorkee, said: “One should always be prepared for an earthquake as we can predict the seismic vulnerable places, but can never predict the time when quake would strike.”
  
  He further said: “We should lay emphasis on constructing earthquake-resilient buildings, choosing correct place for construction and have a family emergency plan in case an earthquake strikes.”
  
  While throwing light on the nature of earthquakes, ML Sharma of IIT Roorkee said that Himalayas are always prone to seismic activities. He also told about the policies and practices evolved in different parts of the world to mitigate the impact of earthquake.
  
  Deputy secretary in state disaster management department,  , stressed on better coordination between government departments and scientific institutions.
  
  He also shared experiences of managing the 2013 Kedarnath disaster.
  
  DMMC executive director,  , also spoke about the earthquakes which had hit Uttarakhand in the past and their impact on the property and population.
