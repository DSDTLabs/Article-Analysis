 Responding to supplementaries during question hour in Lok Sabha, finance minister   said the extradition process takes a lot of time, though some countries extend help in sending back such people fast by deporting them.
 
 In an effort to ensure that such people "cannot hide" in other countries, the government is working on having agreements with maximum number of nations, he said.
 
 When asked by TMC member Saugata Roy as to what steps the government has taken to bring back "IPL man" and "Kingfisher man", Jaitley, without taking names, said Rs 8,040 crore worth of their assets has already been attached by the Enforcement Directorate.
 
 Roy was asked by the chair not to take names in the House. 
 
 Jaitley said, "The relevant prosecuting agencies of the government are resorting to all remedies which are available to them under the law, both for deportation as also for extradition of persons who are trying to avoid the system." 
 
 "The government of India, through diplomatic channels, is also taking it up with their counterparts in the United Kingdom. In my visit two weeks ago to the UK, I also had an opportunity to discuss these very cases with my counterparts there". He said the finance ministry was examining whether a new law would be required or prevailing statutes will have to be amended to confiscate the properties of those who commit financial crimes in India and hide abroad.
