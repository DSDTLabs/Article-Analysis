KORAPUT: A   was found hanging in a hostel bathroom of the government-run residential high school which he attended, on Saturday night in Koraput district. 

 Fourteen-year-old   Majhi studied in Class VIII of Digapur High School, under the   limits. The school is managed by the state's SC and ST development department. 
 
 Majhi was reportedly absent at dinner on Saturday. When his classmates and the hostel-in-charge began searching for him, they found his body hanging in the hostel bathroom.
 
 "The boy was hanging from the bathroom ceiling with a towel. He was alive when he was discovered and hostel authorities rushed him to the Kundura health centre. He was declared dead after a few minutes," said Akhay Kumar Mallick, district welfare officer of Koraput. Mallick had been rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. 
 
 Following a preliminary inquiry, Mallick said Majhi had received an allowance of Rs 2,400 from the government to purchase a bicycle. The money had been deposited directly to his account. He had, however, withdrawn Rs 2,000 from it for his own use. 
 
 "On Friday, the student's father had asked him over telephone about the money. After learning that Bhagaban had spent Rs 2,000 from it, he scolded him and said he will visit his school on Saturday," said Mallick. 
 
 "Bhagaban's friends said the boy was scared that his father would arrive on Saturday and scold him for spending the money. Some think that this fear might have forced the student to take this extreme step," the officer added.
 
 A complaint has been registered at the Boipariguda police station. "An investigation will reveal the real reason behind his death," said Mallick.
