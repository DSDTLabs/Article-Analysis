AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday asked former minister and convict in the 2002 Naroda Patia massacre case  , if her plea seeking to summon witnesses including BJP national president Amit Shah is at all necessary.

 The bench of Justice H N Devani and Justice A S Supehia granted one day’s time to Kodnani’s advocate, to think and reply to the query. One of the judges pointed out that there were contradictions in the stands taken by the accused with regard to examining witnesses.
 
 The judge commented that the application to summon the witnesses at this stage could prove a “double edged sword” because it may have an effect another case as well — the Naroda Gam massacre case, which is pending before the special SIT court. During the hearing on Kodnani’s application, her lawyer did not insist on the earlier demand to summon Shah as a defence witness. Kodnani had requested the HC to summon eight witnesses for examination, on the grounds that the SIT had dropped them from the list of witnesses during the trial.
 
 The special investigation team (SIT), however, has opposed the demand on the grounds that this is not the proper stage for this application.
