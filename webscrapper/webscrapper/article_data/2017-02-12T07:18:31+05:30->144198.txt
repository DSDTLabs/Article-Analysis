HYDERABAD:   seems to have arrived at a new frontier of technology, with filmmakers looking at releases directly on the internet. A new 90-minute Hindi film has just been released on the web with a ticket price of 60. 

 "Mark my words, this is going to be the future of cinema. Not long from now, even big-budget films with a star cast will opt for a release on the internet and not necessarily in theatres," said  , president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India. 
 
 An internet release not only gives the advantage of bypassing the long-drawn process to get a theatrical release, but also gives scope for creative freedom. Some filmmakers are hoping to take advantage of the gaps in the censor rules for the web to get an audience for seemingly controversial movies.
 
 For instance, director   had announced last year that he would release his film, 'Single X', on the web. And from the 'first look' poster of the film, it seems like the director is out to avoid censors.
 
 "Releasing films on the web is not a bad idea, but one must bear in mind that they should have a censor certificate. Every film meant for public exhibition should have CBFC certification according to the rules," said Supran Sen, secretary general of Film Federation of India. However, the Hindi film released on Friday does not have a censor certificate.
