KOLKATA: The terminal at   is set to get livelier this year with curated music and chat shows filling up the clutter of boring flight announcements punctuated by periods of awkward silence and faint strains of instrumental music. 

 “Kolkata   will have a dedicated FM radio where contemporary and retro music will be played. There will also be interactive chat shows through phone-ins. Coupled with the retail experience that is set to get enhanced, the atmosphere in the terminal will become more exciting. We want it to be a happening place,” airport director   told TOI. 
 
 Airports Authority of India has already initiated discussions with all major FM stations and hope to invite letters of interest within a fortnight. The station will be given dedicated rights to air its channel at the airport and sell advertising slots on it. 
 
 At present, Delhi airport has an FM station of its own where   airs its programme Mirchi T3. 
 
 Dixit said a move was already underway to do away with announcements as it only caused cacophony. “Internationally, airport terminals are announcement free with airport operators and airlines switching to personalized SMS and app service to keep fliers updated,” said Dixit.
 
 Kolkata currently has around 200 departures a day. If four announcements are made for each flight in three languages — English, Hindi and Bengali — it would add up to 2,400 announcements. 
 
 “Instead of calling for the last passenger to board or announcing a departure, we want the particular fliers to be intimated. Fliers can also use our app to get the flight information. Airlines have been asked to ensure that all updates happen real-time. At our end, we are revising the signage tender to ensure that more comprehensive and easy-to-comprehend signs are installed to make negotiation in the terminal a lot easier,” Dixit said.
