KOLKATA: After four days, the mercury dipped sub-12 degree Celsius on Thursday. Met office says that the chill will stay. Though the days could be little warmer, nights will continue to be cold. Thanks to the steady inflow of northwesterly wind.

 
 “The fluctuation in mercury is normal as the variation is not that significant. For now, the minimum temperature will hover between 11-12°C, which is below the normal while the days will be a bit warmer is the absence of fog cover,” said   director (weather) at the  .
 
 Thursday saw the mercury dipping to 11.7°C from Wednesday’s 12.5°C. This is one of the longest cold spell Kolkata has experiencing in the recent past. The drop in the mercury began on January 5 when it plunged to 13.7°C from the previous day’s 15°C. It had plummeted as low as low as 10.5°C on January 8, making it the coldest day in five years.
 
 “Such long cold spell in Kolkata is not frequent. This has been due to the absence of any remarkable western disturbance system to block the path of the cold and dry northwesterly wind,” said Das.
 
 A western disturbance is a tropical storm originating from the   region bringing in sudden winter rain of snowfall in parts of   and Kashmir, Himachal and other Himalayan regions. The system blocks the path of the northwesterly wind. And once it triggers snowfall, there is a sudden drop in mercury in this region as the northwesterly wind begins to blow in with renewed speed. And the mercury begins to rise once another western disturbance begins to form. “That is why there has been no significant variation in the temperature resulting in consisted cold spell,” explained Das.
 
 Last year, the minimum temperature had risen to 14°C on January 18, while the maximum temperature was 27.2°C was compared to Thursday’s 26.5°C.
