Chandigarh: City’s municipal corporation is going through its worst financial crisis since it came into existence, but that hasn’t stopped it from splurging money on avoidable works which are not of urgent need.

 In the past 10 days, the civic body has floated tenders for different works of over Rs 1 crore. The works include installing musical fountains, artistic entrance gate, open-air gyms, playing equipment for children in various parks and landscaping of different green belts.
 
 The corporation plans to install musical hybrid fountain with 49 effects in Sector 15 Floral Garden for Rs 5.46 lakh, while Rs 2.05 lakh have been earmarked for operation and maintenance of a fountain in Industrial Area. The corporation has floated a tender for installing fitness equipment at open-air gyms in various green belts and parks in sectors 27, 28 and 30 for Rs 34.11 lakh. There is also a plan for fixing PCC tiles in Adarsh Colony and sectors 54 and 27 for Rs 12.33 lakh and Rs 43.72 lakh, respectively. For the development of the park in Sector 48, including installation of artistic entrance gate, a tender of Rs 21.14 lakh has been floated. MC also intends to spend over Rs 13 lakh on playing equipment for children in various parks in sectors 8 and 47.
 
 Due to shortage of funds, works such as re-carpeting of around 350 kms of road and building of community centres have been halted. 
 
 Despite repeated attempts, MC commissioner Jatinder Yadav and mayor Devesh Moudgil could not be contacted.
 
 Talking to the TOI, former MP Pawan Kumar Bansal said the corporation should spend judiciously as it was going through a tough time. “Development works are good for the city, but the cash-starved MC must prioritise. Besides, the administration should ensure that required funds are provided to the civic body,” he added.
 
 CONTRACTORS STOP WORK
 
 Contractors engaged for various works have stopped operation as the cash-strapped MC has not been able to clear their pending dues. The civic body has not cleared payments below Rs 25 lakh since February, while payments of over Rs 25 lakh are pending since December.
 
 FINANCIAL MESS
 
 Due to the corporation’s failure to take timely corrective measures, its fixed deposits (FD) have decreased from Rs 448 crore to below Rs 40 crore, and its revenue, too, has come down from Rs 169 crore to Rs 107 crore, from 2013-14 fiscal to 2017-18. MC has a monthly liability of Rs 45 crore and annual liability of Rs 540 crore against which it has annual income of only about Rs 154 crore.
 
 Against a demand for Rs 1,001 crore, the corporation got only Rs 317 crore from the Central government for the ongoing financial year. On February 26, MP Kirron Kher had appraised the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs of a shortfall of about Rs 682 crore in the allocation of funds to the corporation and feared that the civic body might not be able to even pay salaries to its employees after a few months.
