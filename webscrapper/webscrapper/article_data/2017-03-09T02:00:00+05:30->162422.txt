PATNA: The Matriculation examination conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) concluded on Wednesday. The exams had started on March 1.

 BSEB chairman Anand Kishor said 17.63 lakh students had filled up the registration form for the matriculation examination which was conducted at 1532 centres across the state.

 The BSEB chairman said the examinees could view the information filled online by colleges and schools on their behalf. “A 15-day time frame would be given to the students to get the wrong entries about subjects and other details rectified at the institution level,” he said, adding that students may visit the BSEB website for verifying the data. He said in future, admit cards would be available for download almost a month before commencement of examination.
 
 “A survey would be taken up by the board and arrangements of computers and operators on temporary basis would be made in future for the entire process.

 He also said a log of patrolling magistrates, zonal and super zonal magistrates were maintained along with mandatory submission of frisking certificate on every 25 examinees submitted by the observers to ensure free and fair examination.
