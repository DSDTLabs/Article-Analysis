PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The College of Engineering Pune ( ) will undertake a third party inspection of the water quality at 13 sewage treatment plants operated by the   as per the   norms. 

 Divisional commissioner   and municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had proposed that the college carry out the project under the Namami Chandrabhaga programme aimed at controlling pollution through industrial and sewage run-off. 
 
 The civic bodyâ€™s environment status report for 2016-17 had stated that Indrayani, Pavana and Mula rivers were being polluted because of the release of untreated domestic and industrial effluents from canals, garbage and ash from crematoriums. 
 
 The main canals include Mamurdi, SKF, Bopkhel, Sandvik, Garware, Kuki, Talwade, Chikhli, Sastewasti, and Wakad. Effluents released into the rivers fuel the growth of water hyacinth. Sewage treatment plants are a major contributor.
 
 While   supplies around 450 MLD (million litres per day) water every day, around 290 MLD sewage is generated. 
 
 The treatment capacity of the 13 STPs is around 333 MLD. However, only 240 MLD sewage water is treated every day and rest released into the rivers. Additional STPs at Charholi, Bopkhel, Chikhli, and Pimple Nilakh are on the anvil.
