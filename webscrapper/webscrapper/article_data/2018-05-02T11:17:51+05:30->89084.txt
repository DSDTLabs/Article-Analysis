ZIRAKPUR: With the Mohali district yet to come up with an official guide for property   after the building collapse incident at   in Peer Muchalla, Zirakpur residents have decided to volunteer and set up an online page to guide the new buyers about the documents they need to check while finalizing the purchase of a residential property in the area. 

  
  
 
 
 The guidance page will include among other things, a detailed list of the projects approved by RERA, the rejected projects with reasons, documents to seek from the builder before and after possession of a property.
 
 Navjit Singh Miglani, a social worker and a resident of VIP Road, will design the webpage. Initially, only basic information would be available for the buyers, but it would be open for experts to join hands on voluntary basis at a later stage.
 
 Manoj Das, a resident of Zirakpur, who is another volunteer working on the page, said there was no platform for the buyers to seek guidance. “This page will be like a hand-out guide for a buyer as there are many instances where the builders misguide buyers”.
 
 He said the page would come with a caution that it was offering basic guidance only and the buyers would need to take legal advice before finalizing a property.
 
 Manbir Gill, another local volunteer, said the authorities kept an eye on the project plans and approvals but checks were conducted after the completion of the project and they did not have a guidance desk for the buyers.
