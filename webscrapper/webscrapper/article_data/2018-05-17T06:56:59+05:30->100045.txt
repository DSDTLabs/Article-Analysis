PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) will start a separate helpline number for its late-night buses. 

 
  
 
 This comes in the wake of the humiliation and harassment of a family by the driver and conductor of a bus of the ‘Raat Rani’ fleet. The family had requested them to ensure that some male passengers vacate seats reserved for women. 
 
 PMPML had suspended the driver for his alleged misbehaviour with the family. The conductor was a daily wage worker. Police commissioner Rashmi Shukla had also ordered a probe against a sub-inspector with the Sahakarnagar police station, who neglected passenger’s complaint when he sought help.
 
 “The family had claimed that they had tried to call the PMPML helpline number, but there was no response. The helpline number (020-24545454) is functional from 6am until 10pm. The incident stressed the need for a dedicated helpline for passengers travelling on the night-time buses. We will soon announce the new helpline,” PMPML joint managing director Ajay Charthankar told TOI.
 
 “The number of passengers availing of these buses is decent. We are trying to soon introduce soft skills training for the drivers and conductors. The new helpline number will also be helpful for the passengers,” he said.
 
 “We have been receiving passengers’ complaints about many drivers and conductors not behaving properly. Complaints from the women are a major concern. Action is being taken on a case-to-case basis. But the need for training is also important,” another official said.
 
 Sumesh Waghmare, a resident of Kondhwa Gate area who has travelled on the ‘Raat Rani’ buses, said there was no reason why the conductors and drivers should be ill-mannered. “These drivers and conductors join duty at 10pm and shouldn’t be ill-tempered, as they are not working since morning,” he said.
