Visakhapatnam: The seven-member gang that robbed a house in the city recently by posing as cops was busted by the police on Saturday. 

 Those arrested were identified as Mohammed Ahmed (32), Vadamodula Sathish (32), Zuber Ahmed (25), Sella Srinu (25), Mohammed Roshan (34), Vadamodula Vijay Kumar (29) and Sheikh Allabakshu (27). The police recovered Rs 10,800 in cash, around 60 grams of gold ornaments and a knife from the gang.
 
 Disclosing details of the case, crime wing DCP T Ravi Kumar Murthy said four members of the gang, one posing as a police officer, forcibly entered fast food centre owner Chandrasekhar Raju’s house at Chaitanyanagar area near Maddilapalem between 1.30 am and 2.30 am on December 22. They threatened Raju and his mother with a knife and took away Rs 51,000 in cash, one gold wrist watch, a diamond ring and 200 grams of gold ornaments. While four members entered the house, three kept watch at the street corners. 
 
 Based on CCTV footage, the cops arrested the main accused Mohammed Ahmed, a mechanic at a scrap shop run by one Kishore, who is the nephew of Chandrasekhar Raju. 
 
 Kishore had confided in Ahmed that his uncle had around Rs 200 crore in cash, comprising old and new currency notes. Believing him, Ahmed hatched a plan with his friends and relatives to rob Raju to meet his requirements. Incidentally, Ahmed’s father is suffering from cancer and is undergoing treatment. 
 
 The DCP said on December 20, the gang had decamped with Rs 25,000 in cash from a locked house at Chaitanyanagar thinking it was Raju’s house. Later, the gang robbed Raju’s house on December 22. 
 
 Investigation also revealed that Raju had exaggerated the amount stolen by the gang. The accused robbed him of Rs 10,800 in cash and 60 grams in gold ornaments. Cops are now taking legal opinion on how to proceed against Chandrasekhar Raju.
