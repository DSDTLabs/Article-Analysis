CHANDIGARH: CM   met   president   in Delhi on Monday to discuss Gurdaspur   byelection with the party's state unit chief Sunil Jakhar being touted as the frontrunner for the contest.

 Party sources said party in charge of   affairs Asha Kumari is likely to meet   on Tuesday, before the party makes a formal announcement of candidate. Jakhar's name is believed to have been endorsed by   even though this would give AAP a chance to accuse the Congress of sending a parachute candidate.
 
 "Jakhar is the most acceptable candidate to the party's local leadership and after his initial reluctance, he has said that he is willing to take the plunge," said a party leader.
 
 The names of Jakhar and other probable candidates, including former   MP Partap Singh Bajwa and his wife and Qadian ex-MLA Charanjit Kaur Bajwa, had figured in the discussions held at a meeting between Kumari, CM and Jakhar in Delhi on Sunday.
 
 Meanwhile, in an interview Amarinder said the debate over local candidate made no sense when he himself had successfully contested the last Lok Sabha election from Amritsar. 
 
 He added that after the division of Punjab, it did not matter if a leader was from some other district.
 
 AICC secretary Harish Choudhary too is likely to submit his report, based on the feedback gathered from party leaders in the state, particularly the Gurdaspur area.Box:
 
 
 
 
 Congress leaders supporting Jakhar said they were in a dilemma whether to start campaigning in Gurdaspur or wait for the formal announcement, which could take a couple of more days, especially with AAP having already announced its candidate. "But in case of Congress, the party follows a procedure that includes taking feedback from all levels before taking a final decision," said a party leader.
