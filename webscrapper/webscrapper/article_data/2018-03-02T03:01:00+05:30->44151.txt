Mapusa/Saligao: Bardez will have two  , one at Mapusa and another at Porvorim, revenue minister Rohan Khaunte said on Thursday.

 “We are planning to have two revenue bhavans in Bardez, one at Mapusa to cater the population of Aldona, Mapusa, Tivim and Siolim and another in Porvorim to cater to the people of Calangute, Saligao and Porvorim,” Khaunte said on the sidelines of a grievances meeting held at Mapusa.
 
 Khaunte said that the number of people attending the taluka level revenue office in Mapusa is huge and government is planning two revenue bhavans similar on the lines of deputy superintendent of police jurisdiction. Bardez has two deputy superintendent of police offices, Mapusa I and Mapusa II.
 
 “Once we have two bhawans operational, then there will be accountability and delivery of timely and better services provided to the common man,” said Khaunte.
 
 Revenue offices including the mamlatdar’s office and deputy collector’s office for Bardez located at the government office complex at Morod, Mapusa, caters to one municipality and 19 panchayats within its jurisdiction.
 
 He said that land for both revenue bhavans has been identified. In Mapusa, the department has land available after the demolition of the old Asilo hospital. For Porvorim, land is being transferred from the housing board.
 
 “The work is in the stage for getting consultants and defining the structures and in the next three to four months, we will be able to finalize plans and we expect, by this year, building construction should be initiated,” Khaunte said.
 
 He said that once the infrastructure is ready, the revenue department can also invite the law department to open a sub-registrar’s office there.
 
 He said that the revenue department is planning to create a system which will randomly allocate cases to joint mamlatdars instead of the current system of handling cases area-wise.
