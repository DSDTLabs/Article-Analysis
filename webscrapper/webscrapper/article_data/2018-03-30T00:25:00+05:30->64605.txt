Jaisalmer: Annoyed over protest by a retired DSP and others over encroachment, district collector K C Meena left night chaupal in the middle of discussion. Two ASIs, who were asked by Meena to remove these protesters were later sent to lines by the SP, for derelictions of duty. As a result, many people left the chaupal disappointed.

 According to sources, retired DSP Chandan Singh Jam and others raised encroachment issue with Meena in the chaupal at Ramgarh. Not satisfied with Meena’s assurance, Jam continued his protest. Meena asked two ASIs, Shyam Singh and Ram Narayan to remove protesters. However, the cops didn’t take any action. Meena left the chaupal and later complained to SP about the cops. The SP sent both cops to lines.
