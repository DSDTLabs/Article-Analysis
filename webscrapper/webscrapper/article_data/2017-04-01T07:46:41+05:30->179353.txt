Navi Mumbai: The civic general body finally sanctioned a budget estimate of Rs 2,934 crore for 2017-18 on Wednesday. The current allocation is Rs 53 crore more than the estimated amount sanctioned earlier by the standing committee. While various developmental works proposed by the corporators led to the increase, two specific projects will be taken up by the civic administration in the next fiscal.

 A grand FOB will be built behind   in sector 17, Vashi, and a musical fountain will come up at the Nerul-based holding pond, also known as the ‘Jewel of Navi Mumbai’. “Shivaji Chowk is a popular city landmark and an ornamental FOB will add value to its identity. Similarly, the Nerul holding pond is now referred to as the ‘Jewel of Navi Mumbai’ and a musical fountain will enhance its image. Musical fountain is one attraction that is not found anywhere in the city and is sure to attract a lot of crowd,” said mayor  .
