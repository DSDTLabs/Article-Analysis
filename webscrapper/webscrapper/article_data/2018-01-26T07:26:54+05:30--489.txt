Pune: The Pune police are verifying the whereabouts and other details of an 18-year-old “missing” girl after a central intelligence agency and Kashmir police sounded an alert that she could be used as a suicide bomber “near or inside” the R-Day parade venue in the  . 

  A police source confirmed that about two years ago, the   (ATS) here had gathered information that the girl, pursuing a nursing course after clearing her Standard XII, was in touch with IS. 
 
 The ATS had then, along with experts, social NGOs and her parents, counselled and de-radicalised the girl, the source said. “There was no fresh information on the girl thereafter till the city police received a copy of the Kashmir police’s wireless message alert and also an alert from the central agency,” a police officer, who did not wish to be named, said. 
 
  said, “The city police received a copy of the wireless alert message sent by the office of the IGP-Kashmir zone, naming the girl as a possible suicide bomber from the state intelligence department (SID). The SID may have received this copy from Kashmir police and the central agency. As of now, we don’t know why the Kashmir police are suspecting the girl.” On Thursday, senior officers of the Pune police questioned the girl’s mother and aunt. They were later allowed to go home.
