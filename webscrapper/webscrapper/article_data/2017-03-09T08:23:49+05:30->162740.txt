NAVI MUMBAI: The   have arrested just 12 men from   for thrashing four   team cops, including a woman constable. The cops claimed that seven people were arrested on Tuesday night and five were arrested on Wednesday. The accused were arrested on the basis of eyewitness accounts and panchnama of the spot where the cops were beaten up by a mob of around 150 residents.

 A police office said that the villagers beat up the cops even after they showed their police identity cards. The mob armed with wooden sticks gheraoed them assuming that they were thieves. “The villagers could have nabbed the four, if they believed they were thieves, instead of assaulting them,” he added.
 
 The cop added that it seems like some miscreants in the mob incited others. “There have been several house break-ins there and the villagers have been alleging inaction by local police. This happened despite the NRI police detecting two recent burglaries in the village,” he added.
