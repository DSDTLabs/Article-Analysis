JAIPUR:   from Deeg-Kumher   has once again put his own party in the dock and called for declaring a   before the assembly elections.

 Arrived in the assembly to cast his vote, Singh mentioned that his party has failed to play its role of Opposition both inside and outside the assembly. “We as a party failed to play our role as aggressively as we should. The leadership must declare a face for the CM post,” he added.
 
 The legislator, who is known for throwing up controversies time and again, has once again stirred the hornets’ nest. Once loyal to PCC chief Sachin Pilot, Singh in a veiled attack questioned him and leader of opposition, Rameshwar Dudi leadership through his remarks. 
 
 In past too Singh has made similar demand and even cautioned Congress central leadership against 'dreaming' about returning to power in the state without declaring the chief ministerial candidate. 
 
 Last year, Singh raked the controversy in Congress state politics by asking Congressmen in a meeting to raise hands in support of PCC chief Sachin Pilot for the chief minister's post. Pilot and former chief minister Ashok Gehlot were present in the meeting held at PCC headquarters then.
 
 However, there has been a love lost between them in recent past as Pilot is believed to quelled Singh’s desire to become leader of opposition in the state assembly.
