NEW DELHI: Union housing minister   met Delhi chief minister   and his deputy Manish Sisodia on Friday afternoon, which is being seen as the advent of a thaw between the two leaders after their spats in public over issues relating to   of commercial establishments and expansion of the Metro rail networks.

 Delhi Lt Governor   was also present in the meeting. This was announced by Puri through his twitter post. “Invited @LtGovDelhi Delhi CM @ArvindKejriwal & Dy CM @msisodia for lunch. We discussed host of issues including the ones arising out of the sealing drive in Delhi on directive of Hon’ble SC,” Puri tweeted.
 
 Earlier this week, Puri had told TOI that though a meeting was planned on Monday, it could not happen as Lok Sabha Speaker had a lunch for all MPs on that day. He had also suggested to Kejriwal that they should discuss important pending issues including phase-IV of Delhi Metro project and rapid rail corridor connecting Delhi with Meerut.
 
 Officials did not divulge the details of Friday’s meeting. “It was a cordial meeting and all issues were discussed by the leaders,” said an official.
