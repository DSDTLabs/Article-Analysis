BELAGAVI:   MLA from   Rural   has said the assembly elections is not a fight for good roads, drains and drinking water but a war between Hindus and Muslims.

 
 Speaking at a campaign meeting in Sulebhavi village four days ago, Patil said those who want   and Tipu Jayanti can follow  , while those who want Shivaji can vote for the BJP. A video of Patil’s speech has gone viral on social media.
 
 Patil, who has often courted controversies for his rabble-rousing speeches, said, “India is a Hindu country and there must be a Ram Mandir. I am committed to the construction of the Ram Mandir. Let Congress candidate Laxmi Hebbalkar make clear her stand on Ram Mandir. If she tells she is committed to it, I too will vote for her. If you vote for the Congress, they will only build Babri Masjid,” Patil told the crowd.
 
 Congress candidate Laxmi Hebbalkar said it’s obvious that Sanjay Patil is playing the Hindutva card as he has nothing to say about development and has done nothing for the constituency for 10 years.
