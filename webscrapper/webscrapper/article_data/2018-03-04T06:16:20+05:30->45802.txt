Major gaps in the existing law is why most smugglers go scot-free, say experts. While there is a host of agencies that restrict the entry of exotic species into the country, wildlife of foreign origin is still not protected under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1992. "This makes it extremely difficult to handle cases of smuggling as the chief wildlife warden has no authority to deal with them, as per law," said A  , officer on special duty (wildlife),   adding that an amendment to the Act is before the  . "Once it is passed, the wildlife warden will have powers to regulate the trade and traders can be asked to enrol with the department," he said. 

 Shankaran confirmed that the department, over the last few years has been getting requests from dealers to import exotic species and giving them 'no objection' certification but we do not hive these certificates.
 
 The need of the hour, experts say, is coordination between Forest Department, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, State Police, Railway Police and Customs. "This is missing in most of the states and it goes undetected. In some states there is a Forest Cell in Police headed by a IG ranked officer, that looks after Forest and wildlife related offences. Unfortunately, it is missing in AP and Telangana," said   conservation scientist from WCS-India.
