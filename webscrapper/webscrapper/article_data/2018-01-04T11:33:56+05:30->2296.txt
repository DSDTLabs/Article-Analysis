BENGALURU: A loan of Rs 11.08 lakh and an affair resulted in the   Tara Prabhu, whose decomposed body was found at her mother’s house on January 1, police said on Wednesday. 

 Late on Tuesday night,   arrested a Gopinath alias Gopi, a resident of Horamavu. Police, who claim to have obtained a confession from Gopi, said he smothered Tara and also slit her throat. He was an animal trainer.
 
 Police said Gopi, 35, who is married and has children, was having an affair with Tara. The two first met through Tara’s husband, Prabhu, who trained Gopi as a dog and birds’ trainer in 2014 and 2015.
 
 “Gopi and Tara became friends and had an affair. In 2016, he borrowed Rs 11.08 lakh from Tara for his bird-rearing business, without the knowledge of her family,” police said. They began to have differences when Gopi couldn’t return the money on time, police said, adding that Tara wanted it immediately as she had pledged her jewellery to raise the money and couldn’t keep it a secret for too long. “I was about to pay but she insisted that I give the entire amount immediately and even threatened to file a false rape case against me,” police quoted Gopi to have said in his statement.
 
 According to police, the two had a fight on the evening of December 29, which ended in Tara’s murder. It was only three days later that Tara’s body was discovered in the bedroom of her mother’s house. The incident came to light when her mother Sarala returned from Hubballi. While Sarala was out of town, Tara had borrowed the house keys to live there.
