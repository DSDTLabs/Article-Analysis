MUMBAI: A 26-year-old fan’s dream to talk to actor   Kapoor-Khan has landed him behind bars as the cyber police on Monday arrested him for hacking into the star’s income tax account and filing her declaration. 

 The accused, Manish Tiwari, is a paramilitary   posted in Chhattisgarh. The police said that last August, while searching for the actor’s mobile number on the internet, Tiwari stumbled upon her  . He then hacked into the actor’s income tax account and uploaded her declaration form for 2016-17. 
 
 When Kareena’s chartered accountant (CA) Prakash Thakkar found out that she had already filed the declaration, he became suspicious. A team, led by joint commissioner of police (crime) Sanjay Saxena tracked down Tiwari to Chhattisgarh on Sunday and brought him to the city.
