 Some parents approached the school management on Monday over the issue of affiliation. They complained that the school management had promised the affiliation while granting admission to their kids in junior KG. However, the school has not obtained the affiliation with either of the boards even as the new academic year will start soon and their children will enter class 1. The school has been charging high fees accordingly, the parents complained.
 
 During the meeting on Monday, the school management had called police fearing that situation might escalate. The presence of police infuriated those who came for the meeting and objected to any intervention by cops in the matter. They have decided to meet the management once again on Tuesday to reiterate their demand. School’s managing trustee,   said, “I have not issued any threat. I am sure that we will get the affiliation in time.”
