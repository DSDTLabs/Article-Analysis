Instead of taking me to safety, they once again handed me over to another group of IS terrorists,” he claimed.
 
 The second group of IS terrorists quizzed him and asked about his nationality and religion. “I told them that my name is Ali, a Bangladeshi Muslim. They asked me whether I was Shia or Sunni. As I didn’t know the difference between the two, I told them I didn’t understand them and kept on saying that I believe in Allah,” he said.
 
 Masih claimed that he managed to fool them and after satisfying themselves that he was not lying, the IS men took him to a group of Bangladeshi nationals, with whom he left Iraq and reached  , from where he contacted the Indian embassy and returned to Delhi.
 
 However, external affairs minister   in her statement had said on Tuesday that Masih had cooked up his story that he was taken into a jungle with his compatriots where IS terrorists had shot them.
