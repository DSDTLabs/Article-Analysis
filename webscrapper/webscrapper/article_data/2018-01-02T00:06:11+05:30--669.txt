Tirupur: A 40-year-old businessman committed suicide after allegedly suffering a heavy loss in the knitwear garment manufacturing business in Uthiyur here on Sunday. V Manikandasamy of Sankaradampalayam in Dharapuram taluk was working for a garment manufacturing unit for seven years before acquiring the firm three years ago. “He had invested more than Rs 15 lakh in the unit at Samundipuram on Avinashi Road. It was dedicated to domestic garment buyers,” a police officer said. “He had borrowed heavily from private moneylenders to start the unit. The business was doing good for the first two years. However, after the demonetisation drive was launched, his company did not get orders. Its survival was further hindered when the Union government implemented GST,” Manikandasamy’s wife Sri Vidhya said. The businessman was struggling to repay the loans and had to sell the machines to pay to the lenders. He had closed the company three months ago, the woman said. “Since then, he was found depressed. We shifted from Tirupur to Sankaradampalayam, his native place. He again started searching for a job. But, he consumed poison at home on December 23. He was under treatment at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he died on Sunday,” she added. Manikandasamy is survived by his wife and a nine-year-old daughter. The businessman’s suicide is the second such incident reported from the city in the last two months.
