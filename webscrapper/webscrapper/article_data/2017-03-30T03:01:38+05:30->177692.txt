NEW DELHI: Reacting to LG Anil Baijal’s directions to the chief secretary, Delhi   chief Ajay Maken was quick to point out that it was on his petition that a three-member committee set up by the Centre had indicted the   government for allegedly violating the SC guidelines on advertisements last year. BJP demanded that in view of LG’s order, CM Arvind Kejriwal should resign. 

 “The 18-month battle in the Supreme Court has finally paid off as the amount recovered from AAP can now be used for various welfare projects in Delhi,” Maken said.
 
 He added that he and his team had approached the SC in July, 2015 against violation of apex court’s guidelines and the splurge of public money, allegedly by the Kejriwal government. “At this juncture, the Supreme Court referred Maken’s petition to   high court. Thereafter, the HC heard the matter on 24 occasions and decided to refer the matter to the committee constituted in keeping with Supreme Court directions to examine violation of Government Advertisement Guidelines,” Maken said.
 
 Thereafter, the three-member committee pronounced its order on September 9, 2016 holding the Kejriwal government guilty for wasting public money on political advertisements. The committee had also directed the chief secretary, Delhi government to recover the cost of illegal ads from AAP. This decision has today been implemented by the LG,” Maken said. “The Delhi Congress built constant public pressure through awareness and signature campaigns against the ad splurge of AAP, along with its legal battle in court.”
 
 BJP also welcomed the LG’s order. “While seeking support of people during assembly elections, Kejriwal spoke about clean politics and providing an alternative system of governance. It is unfortunate that he misused taxpayers’ money to expand his party’s political footprint...He should resign on moral grounds,” said Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.
