NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old girl who had left her home looking for a music teacher to pursue her passion for   was reunited with her parents after a few hours because of a video call she made to a relative.

 The incident was reported by the girl’s parents on Wednesday morning when girl went missing. A few hours after the incident, the girl had called a relative through a video calling software to ask whether her parents were looking for her and had disconnected the call. However, the relative had somehow managed to record the video call on another phone and approached the police.
 
 In the video, the police had noticed a motorbike parked behind her and traced it to a locality in   where they found the girl staying at the house of a music teacher whom she had met online. “We had registered a case of kidnapping at the Rajouri Garden Police Station when we received a complaint and launched a manhunt to locate the girl,” said Vijay Kumar, DCP, west.
 
 It was found that she had contacted the music teacher on a social networking site and had gone to meet her without informing her parents. The girl claimed that she wanted to join   and train with that particular teacher since she had seen the woman on television.
 
 When the woman had enquired whether she had told her parents about her visit, the girl had faked a call to a cousin who posed as her mother and spoke to the teacher saying that she had permitted her to join the classes. She even requested the music teacher to allow the girl to stay back at her home for a few hours as it would be difficult for her to return back home.
 
 When police reached the house, the woman too was shocked by the turn of events. “We are also questioning her for further details mentioned by the girl and handed her back to her parents,” said a police officer.
