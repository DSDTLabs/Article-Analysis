Greater Noida: A 23-year-old man hit by his elder brother with an iron rod in his sleep died on Tuesday at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital.

 Pushpendra Singh was sleeping in a room with his mother Shakuntala Devi when his elder brother entered the room and attacked them. The accused Ajit Singh, a 27-year-old MBA who helped people open accounts at an   branch in Noida, was apparently unhappy over demands by his brothers for division of property.
 
 While Shakuntala Devi died at Sarvodaya Hospital on Monday, Pushpendra had been shifted to the Delhi health facility after his condition deteriorated. Ajit had attacked another brother, Ratendra, who is recuperating at Sarvodaya Hospital.
 
 Sources said that after attacking his mother and two brothers early on Monday, Ajit wiped the blood stains off the floor, changed his clothes and left home in Rasulpur village of Jarcha in his car as neighbours gathered. He was arrested later in the evening. SP (rural) Greater Noida Suniti said Pushpendra had suffered critical injuries in the head. “His elder brother attacked him in sleep. The victim could not get time to defend himself,” she said.
 
 Jagdish Singh, the father of the three brothers, had retired from NTPC two years ago and mostly remained ill. Sources said Ajit, who managed the finances of the family, was averse to the idea of dividing the property despite repeated demands by his brother. The trouble apparently started among the three after Ratendra married in December last year. The family owns a 10-acre agricultural plot in their village. The land apparently was the bone of contention among the brothers. 
 
 “On Monday morning, Ajit first attacked his mother and youngest brother who were sleeping in a room. He then attacked Ratendra after he came out of the washroom,” a police officer said.
