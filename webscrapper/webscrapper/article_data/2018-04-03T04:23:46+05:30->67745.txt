MUMBAI: The new   may upset   in Ramzan for many this year. Ramzan (May 15-June 15) falls during vacation and many Muslims who spent the last year's holy month in   and Medina as Umrah pilgrims may not undertake the pilgrimage this year as they will have to pay 2,000 Saudi riyals (Rs 35,000) as the Umrah visa fee. While   is conducted annually, Umrah can be performed multiple times through the year. 

 Last year, the Saudi authorities kept the first Umrah visa free and charged 2,000 riyals for each subsequent visit. But this year the rule says that all those who performed Umrah last year and intend to perform it this year again will be considered "repeaters" and will have to pay 2,000 riyals. "There are families which have performed Umrah in Ramzan for many years. The new rule is discouraging them and the bookings for   is likely to reduce by 50%," said Imran Alvi of Alvi Tours and Travels. He added that Islamic months Ramzan and Rabilawwal (when the Prophet's birthday is celebrated) see huge rush for Umrah.
 
 A tour operator who is currently in Mecca told TOI on phone that he had to reduce the number of hotel rooms he had initially booked because of anticipation of reduced business since, from this year, the tour operators have to pay 5% VAT plus 2.5% municipal tax, which ultimately will spike the total travel cost. 
 
 Many blamed the Saudi government of treating Haj and Umrah as "religious tourism". "The Saudis are in financial difficulties and they are using the holy rituals as means to bankroll their lifestyle," said activist Shaddab Patel. Mazgaon resident Mustafa Masalawala, who wants to take his mother for Umrah, said that the Saudis, increasing the visa cost will harm the Saudi economy.
