It was a proud moment for every Malayali present when legendary writer   was felicitated in the city recently at an event titled Pranama Sandhya, organised by the Malayalam Cine Technicians Association (MACTA). The applause gained momentum as MT stepped on to the stage, with   doing the honours. In keeping with his habit of cracking jokes on stage, Mammootty said that two minutes would not be enough for him to speak about M T Vasudevan Nair. 'He is someone who has perfected Malayalam cinema with his works, capturing the beauty of villages and the tenderness of family relationships,' he said. 'Our literature today is a result of the efforts and works of people like him.'

 Directors Lal Jose, Sibi Malayil, Ranjith, Fazil, Balachandra Menon, Santhosh Varma and Joy Mathew were among the others felicitated at the event while producer Aroma Mani, stunt master Thyagarajan, art director Radhakrishnan and make-up artiste Padmanabhan ensured that the dignitaries were honoured well.
 
 Director Sibi Malayil said that the characters MT has given life to in his works has always evoked a sense of respect in him, and it continues the same way even now. 
  Namitha Pramod sported her new hairdo and tattoos on her arm while actors Kunchacko Boban,  , Jayasurya and Unni Mukundan looked equally dashing at the do, and flaunted style statements of their own. Prayaga Martin, Anusree and Jomol added to the glam quotient of the do.
