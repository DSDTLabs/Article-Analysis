BANGALURU: The demand to give legal sanctity to  , the annual buffalo race in coastal Karantaka, continues to gain momentum. 

 On Friday, several pro-Kannada organizations under the banner of Kannada Okkuta led by activist Vatal Nagaraj, called for a Karnataka   on February 18. Activists said they want an ordinance to lift the ban on kambala as well as speedy resolution of the Mahadayi and Kalasa-Banduri disputes.
 
 “The central government has ignored the interests of Karnataka on many fronts. In case of jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the CM of that state of complete support... However, when it comes to Karnataka, neither the PM nor the state MPs have been proactive,” said Vatal.
 
 As part of the bandh,   will gherao the offices of deputy commissioners in every district. “We can’t tolerate the Centre’s negligence towards Karnataka any more,” Vatal added.
 
 Peaceful march tomorrow
 
 On Sunday, kambala supporters will hold a peaceful march from Mysore Bank Circle to Freedom Park, urging the government to pass an ordinance for holding the buffalo race.
 
 Organizers Rajdhani Kambala Kriyasheelta Samithi and Tulu Koota said if the authorities don’t heed their demand, they will begin an agitation from February 1.
 
 “Kambala has got nothing to do with cruelty against any animal,” Tulu Koota Bengaluru president Jayaram Sooda told reporters on Friday. “We raise cattle like our own children. Kambala is a tradition for us. It is our right to stick to our cultural practices... We urge the government to act immediately and help us preserve our culture,” he added.
 
 Sandeep Kumar Shetty, member of Rajdhani Kambala Kriyasheelta Samithi, said: “People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA) is not adequately aware about kambala; they mistakenly think the practice involves animal cruelty. We care for our buffaloes. In fact, in our culture, cattle become our family members.”
