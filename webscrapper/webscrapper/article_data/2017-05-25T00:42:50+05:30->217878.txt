New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday put commercial establishments and eateries operating out of   Village under scanner.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rekha Palli asked the south corporation to file a status report explaining on what basis permission has been granted to the eateries to run in the extended Lal Dora area, which is meant for residential purpose.
 
 HC acted on a PIL filed by Pankaj Sharma in 2013 alleging that restaurants, pubs, fashion studios, bars serving liquor without licence, etc. are all operating illegally and posing a danger to everyone. Sharma alleged that there are over 120 restaurants and pubs running without building plan approval since the past 10 years.
 
 “The restaurants are violating the instructions of the Archaeological Survey of India barring any construction within 100m of its protected monuments,” the plea added.
 
 The court also heard another plea by a lawyer Anuja Kapur who said that such pubs and bars lack NOC from the authorities concerned, while the police ignore several illegal activities in the area, encouraging lawless behavior.
 
 On her plea, HC asked the police and the fire department to inspect the village and submit a report on how easy or difficult it is for an emergency vehicle to reach the spot in case of any eventuality.
 
 HC also asked concerned officials to carry out a survey and find the exact number of restaurants operating illegally.
