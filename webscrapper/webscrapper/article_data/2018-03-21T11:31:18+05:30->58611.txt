BHOPAL: Drought has dried up attendance in schools in the remote district of  , bordering Rajasthan.

 A large number of   have migrated from the district, accompanied by their children, in search of work in harvest season.
 
 This is also exam season, and in most schools, there are only a handful of kids left to appear in the tests. In primary and middle classes in Karhal block, about 450km from Bhopal, there are schools with less than 10 students appearing in exams, say sources. There are bizarre rumours that teachers are writing the exams for children to ensure that they pass. In  , only five out of 27 students appeared in the exam, and in a village called Doba, only three students of class V appeared in maths exam, officials said. Nonar Silpur primary school fared better, with 35 out of 70 writing their exam.
 
 There are as 242 primary schools in Karhal block with 15,271 students and 75 middle schools with 9,390 students. But good luck finding them in class.“The government wants good results but here the situation is different. We write exams for students and also take the help of some senior students to fill copies with answers,” a schoolteacher said, asking not to be named.
 
 Officials, however, deny this strongly. Block and   Pradeep Shrivastava said, “Absentee students will take their exam separately when they return. I don’t have reports of teachers writing the exams. In case I find any such instance, we will hold an inquiry.”
 
 Shrivastava is the education department official responsible for functioning of the schools. District collector   denied the migration of tribals from the district. “There are enough jobs and there is hardly any water crisis,” he said. In November last year, however, the state had included Sheopur among drought-affected districts. Sources said the tribal migration started early this year. Most of them have moved to neighbouring cities of Rajasthan in search of work. Some of them even migrate as far as Gujarat.
