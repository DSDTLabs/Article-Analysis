LUCKNOW: In another blow to the city’s dipping law and order situation, armed assailants robbed a jewellery store at gunpoint in the congested parts of Chowk market on Sunday evening.   items worth several crores of rupees were taken away. About Rs 1.20 crore in cash was also robbed, though detailed information was yet to be submitted to police.

 Around 8.40pm, owner of Mukund jewellers, Pravin Rastogi and his son Jitanshu were preparing to wind up for the day. The shop is located in Chowk bullion market, barely 400 metres away from local police station, inside Gol Darwaza.
