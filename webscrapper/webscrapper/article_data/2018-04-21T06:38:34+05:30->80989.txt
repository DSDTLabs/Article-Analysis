BENGALURU: Your travel time on   may get shorter once   gets necessary approval.

 BMRCL has sought the railway board’s permission for sanction of rolling stock to operate at a maximum of 80kmph on both lines, up from the current average speed of 35kmph.
 
 Officials said they can operate at 80kmphin stretcheswith nosharp curves. For instance, BMRCL cannot increase speed near   and Indiranagar stations, which have sharp curves. The railway safety commissioner will take a final call on the speed considering the safety of passengers.
 
 However, a senior BMRCL official said travel time may not reduce to a great extent. “The distance between two stations is about a kilometre and once the train accelerates at 70-80 kmph, it has to deaccelerate to a lesser speed within 25-30 seconds to enable the train to have a smooth stop at the next station,” he said “Speed is limited by some inherent factors of angle, frequency of the bends, gradient,etc.Dueto a stop every km, trains can not attain maximum speed in most sections. Therefore, it’s difficult to say by how much the journey time will be reduced,” he added.
