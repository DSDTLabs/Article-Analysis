JALANDHAR:   Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday threatened to throw state   in jail if Congress is voted to power in the state.

 Amarinder addressed three rallies in Shahkot, Nakodar and Kartarpur on Wednesday. During his earlier stint in power, he said he had jailed the present Shahkot MLA Kohar, who is now once again SAD candidate from the constituency. He said he would jail Kohar again since he was allegedly linked with sale of cannabis.
 
 Kohar, a four-time MLA who has never lost an election since 1997, has strongly denied the allegations in the past.
 
 Amarinder also alleged that   was responsible for bloodshed in Punjab and loss of 35,000 lives as the recent declassified report of CIA had exposed his role during terrorism.
 
 Referring to the SYL issue, the PCC leader reiterated his vow to prevent even a single drop of water from leaving the state, even if he had to go to jail for it.
 
 “Haryanvi“ Kejriwal would sell   to his native state if elected in Punjab, he said.
