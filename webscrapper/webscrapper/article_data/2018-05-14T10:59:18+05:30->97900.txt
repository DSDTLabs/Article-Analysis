JALANDHAR: Te recent incident of assault on Sikh preacher   of Chandigarh at a   gurdwara on May 8, in which his turban got removed, has made a group of prominent Sikh intellectuals to call upon Sikh institutions to guarantee the honour, dignity and safety of all Gursikhs, who visit their premises regardless of the views they hold. 

 “The Khalsa realises that all international acclaim that it has earned in recent past has been due to adherence to the Guru’s word and rehat (code of conduct). All goodwill, success and glory will be reduced to dust as soon as the Sikhs accept to adjust their thought and conduct according to the demands of vigilante groups and their mentors and those who remote control them,” said Sikh intellectuals Gurtej Singh, Prof Gurdrashan Singh Dhillon, Jaspal Singh Sidhu and Gurpreet Singh of Singh Sabha, Chandigarh, in a joint statement on Saturday. 
 
 “The institution heads are duty bound to protect even those Sikhs who live according to Guru’s word and interpret it according to the Guru  . The Sikhs must be respected even when they refuse to succumb to the intimidation, insults and abuse of goons and refuse to give up on the truth as they know it,” they said. 
 
 They said that the ultimate cause of hatred expressed in this manner was that the majority of the Sikhs are increasingly returning to the Guru’s original teachings and avoiding babas and dera heads.
