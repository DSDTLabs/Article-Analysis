MUMBAI: Even as the state government plans to move the apex court against the   on scrapping the   for postgraduate admissions on Tuesday, around 6,500 candidates are anxiously waiting for the results. The first merit-based selection list released on Sunday morning was scrapped by the afternoon following the HC order, adding to the admission chaos.

 While the HC asked the state to draw the merit list based on the earlier eligibility criteria, the state has decided to wait till the   decides on the matter. Pravin Shingare, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said that the government will decide on the next move after their appeal is heard. Of the 6,500 candidates, around 2,000 are from outside the state and were declared ineligible overnight after the state government’s resolution making the domicile certificate mandatory was issued on April 27. Though the HC ruled in their favour, students from the state were displaced in the merit list.
 
 Dr Punshi Parekh, a domicile candidate for the   seat, who got 162nd rank in Maharashtra and an all-India rank of 1,710 in NEET-PG, said, “In the list that was out on Sunday, I had managed to get a paediatric seat at Sion Hospital, which was my second preference. According to the all-India rank I will now get a seat in a college in Baroda. The reporting time in several rounds of admissions that is going on simultaneously will end in the next three to four days and if the decision is not clear by then, we will end up losing a better chance.”
 
 Another student also faced the same dilemma. “Though our preference would be to study in Mumbai, a lot will also depend on what students above us would choose in the All-India process. Hope there is some clarity on the issue by Tuesday,” said the student. Students from outside the state, however, also claim that the state should have made domicile mandatory in January or February, after NEET ranks were announced and not in the eleventh hour.
