SHIMLA: Expressing its displeasure over the attire of a female junior engineer while appearing in a case before it, the Himachal Pradesh high court has directed government officials to follow a dress code while attending court or office. 

 While appearing in a case related to misappropriation of funds in the irrigation and public health department under Lamblu panchayat in   district, junior engineer   worn a multi-coloured shirt and jeans, which the court said was not appropriate.
 
 “What is more appalling is when she informed the court that she even discharges her official duties wearing only these kinds of dresses,” observed the division bench of Justice   and Justice   in the order issued on Monday.
 
 “The dress should be worn in order to maintain the dignity and decorum of the court and, therefore, we see no reason why any litigant, more particularly government officers and officials, should be improperly or inappropriately dressed while appearing before the court,” the bench said.
 
 The court directed the chief secretary to issue necessary directions to all concerned and to submit a compliance report before the next date of hearing.
