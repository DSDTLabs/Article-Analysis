The   announcement has been receiving mixed reaction on social media from Friday afternoon. Many film lovers and critics expressed their displeasure over the jury turning a blind eye towards the work of a few artistes and technicians, who according to them, deserved the prestigious recognition. 

 Director AR   minced no words while speaking his mind. He took to Twitter to express the same. He posted, “#NationalAwards Can clearly witness the influence & partiality of people in jury, it’s biased.” Interestingly, many appreciated the filmmaker for voicing his opinion openly. Murugadoss, however, was unavailable for a comment. 
 
 Meanwhile, his yet-to-be titled film, starring Mahesh Babu, SJ Suryah, Rakul Preet, Bharath, among others, completed schedules in Vietnam and Chennai recently. Tentatively titled Spyder, the crew of this bilingual flick, according to a source, will head to Hyderabad to shoot further portions.
