PANAJI:   Manohar Parrikar again refused to clear the air regarding his post-poll return to Goa. “I have lost 4 kg in Delhi. I like Goan food more. Anything can be inferred from that,” Parrikar said after casting his vote on Saturday. “I am a party man, I will follow whatever decision the party decides to take,” he added, when asked about the speculation surrounding his return to the state. 

 He said the BJP is confident of a two-thirds majority, adding that the mandate will be a certification of the good work of the government.
 
 On missing the Union Budget, he said, “Goa is my home state and if I’m not breaking any law and abiding by the democratic process, there is nothing wrong.” He said he would also campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur . 
 
 On post-poll alliances, he said that as BJP is confident of a majority, there is no point in talking of alliances.
