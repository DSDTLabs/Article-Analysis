NEW DELHI: Ahead of plans to open seven city forests for the public, department of forest and wildlife conducted a bird and butterfly   last month at the Mitraon city forest. 

 The census revealed 39 different species, including rare sightings like the Indian jungle nightjar, long-tailed minivet and nine   species.
 
 The department has now plans to conduct several surveys at city forests like Garhi mandu,  ,  ,   and Alipur to determine the kind of habitat it has to attract birds.
 
 “We had a successful census at Mitraon where 10 acres has already been opened for the public. Now we will conduct a census next at Isapur. These will give us an indication of the habitat there so that we can prepare accordingly,” said a senior forest officer.
 
 Sohail Madan, centre manager, BNHS (Asola) said that the preliminary survey reports were very promising. “This urban forest holds a great diversity of birds and butterflies, which is a boon for the residents. The highlight of the survey was an Indian jungle nightjar, which is a nocturnal bird and is extremely elusive for Delhi. Apart from that, we have spotted small minivets and long-tailed minivets, which are endemic to this part of the city,” he added.
 
 The census also recorded a red-breasted flycatcher, a golden flameback woodpecker, two types of raptors, including a shikra and eight spotted owlets among others. The butterflies found included the cabbage butterfly and the common emigrant.
 
 Forest officials said that the next census might begin by the end of this month, with modifications made to the city forests based on the findings.
