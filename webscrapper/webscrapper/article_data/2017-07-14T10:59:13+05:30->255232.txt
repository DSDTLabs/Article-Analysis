PUNE: Green activists here want the   to take action against, what they termed, “illegal directives” of the Union and Maharashtra governments towards environmental regulations in the state.

 Addressing the media on Thursday, tree activist   said they were planning to move court against the Centre and state government’s recent orders that diluted the “independent regulations”.
 
 An order by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change on July 7 said projects in the Pune and Konkan divisions of Maharashtra, which are being constructed on an area less than 1.5 lakh square metres, will not have to seek a separate environment clearance for the final go ahead. 
 
 A state government directive on July 11 made an amendment to the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 and ruled that if the number of trees required to be felled is 25 or less, the municipal commissioner — or an equivalent officer in planning authorities and other civic bodies — has the discretion to approve the project without a consensus among the tree committee members.
 
 “The tree authority chair is there to protect the city’s green cover, while the municipal commissioner is there to promote development projects,” Jain said. 
 
 The activist said while his group was planning to approach the   or higher courts to nullify the orders, the Supreme Court should take action on its own.
