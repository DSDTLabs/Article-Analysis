THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   travellers have been promised faster journeys with the corporation deciding to launch   from next month. As the name suggests, these buses will have limited stops and will reach their destinations sooner compared to other  . The fares will be the same as that of the super-class services. 

 The corporation has already begun a trial run for 30 days in some of the major routes and has allotted six super deluxe buses. The routes in which the trial runs are being conducted are: Thiruvananthapuram-Sulliya via Kottayam, Thiruvananthapuram-Nilambur via Kottayam, Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode via Kottayam, Thiruvananthapuram-Palakkad via Kottayam, Kattapana-Thiruvananthapuram via Mundakkayam and Punalur-Palakkad via Pathanamthitta.
 
 Thiruvananthapuram-Sulliya will leave at 5pm to reach Sulliya at 8.05am the next day; Thiruvananthapuram-Nilambur bus leaves at 7.45pm to reach Nilambur at 4.20 am; Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode bus will depart at 9pm and arrive in Kozhikode at 5.40 am, Thiruvananthapuram-Palakkad bus leaves at 10pm to reach Palakkad at 5.50am, Kattappana-Thiruvananthapuram bus will leave at 5 am and reach Thiruvananthapuram by10.20am and Punalur-Palakkad bus leaves at 8.15pm to reach Palakkad at 2.30am, the next day.
 
 KSRTC chairman and managing director M G Rajamanickam said: “Even the super class services have more than ten stops. Minnal service has been aimed at people who want to reach their destination in a short time. Instead of increasing the speed, we have reduced the number of stops for these buses. These buses will have stops only at major bus stations, unlike the other super class services. We will be observing the passengers’ reception. If found viable, the services will be added to schedules in next month,” said Rajamanickam.
 
 KSRTC is also considering other routes such as Thiruvananthapuram-Amrita Hospital, Kochi and   to be included in Minnal service
