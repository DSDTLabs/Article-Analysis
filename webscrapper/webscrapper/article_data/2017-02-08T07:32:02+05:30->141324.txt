MUMBAI: Right To Information activist Jitendra Ghadge who had sought information on corrupt civic officials has alleged that the   is going soft on them accused and not taking strict action against them. According to   data, BMC is the fifth most corrupt department in the state. The revenue department is the most corrupt, followed by the police force, panchayat samiti and MSEB.

 According to the information re ceived by Ghadge from the chief officer (enquires), 2,067 civic employees are facing departmental probes in 241 pending enquiries and 34 officials are under suspension for criminal cases.Also, 38 civic employees are under suspension in other cases. In 2014-15, the civic body found only two officials guilty and removed them from service while letting off 566 employees with a warning or after paying a small fine. Of those who were let off, two officials were demoted, increments of 90 civic employees were withheld, 345 staffers were imposed with fines and 221 were given warnings.
 
 In 2015-16, three civic officials were dismissed for corruption cases and 304 employees were let off with a warning or penalty . A total of 104 Class A employees are facing inquiries, including 2 deputy municipal commissioners, three chief fire officers, 19 doctors and 44 executive engineers. “The BMC needs to crack down on corruption in its departments on its own. Letting off   with warnings encourages graft in the civic body . We can't blame corporators alone when it comes to scams and irregularities. BMC officials too are hand in glove,“ Ghadge said.
 
 “Almost all the citizens have had a bitter experience when it comes to dealing with civic officials. How long shall we suffer due to corrupt and irresponsible officials. People have lost lives due to potholes; are these officials responsible for it?“
