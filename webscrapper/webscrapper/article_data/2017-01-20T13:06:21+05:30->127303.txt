CALANGUTE: Calling Vijai Sardesai a ‘dalal’, the  , Agnelo Fernandes, on Wednesday rubbished the former’s claims that he was contesting for the Saligao seat to rain on   (GFP) candidate Jayesh Salgaocar’s parade and to facilitate the victory of tourism minister Dilip Parulekar.

 “He (Sardesai) is a ‘dalal’ and deal-maker. The Saligao seat was always for the Congress all through the discussions for an alliance. I had told Salgaocar to contest on the Congress ticket, but Sardesai misled him and made him contest as a GFP candidate despite the understanding that the Congress would field its candidate in Saligao,” Fernandes said at a press conference in Calangute on Wednesday. “He’s a BJP man,” he added.
 
 Fernandes said he was confident of winning the Saligao seat. “Half the constituency was part of Calangute constituency when I was MLA for 10 years, so I’m well-known and have a lot of supporters there,” he said.
