CHANDIGARH: Former   chief minister Bhupinder Singh   on Friday flayed the Manohar Lal Khattar-led, BJP-ruled state government for discontinuing scholarship extended to outstanding sportspersons from the Dalit community.

 Hooda said the government withheld a disbursal of Rs 7.68 crore to be paid to Dalit sportspersons. “This comes after the government withdrew itself from allotting 100-square-yards plots to people hailing from the Dalit community. It shows BJP has nothing to do with Dalits. They just use the names of Dalit personalities, like B R Ambedkar, to gain mileage in the community,” he said.
 
 The   leader asked the BJP government to resume the disbursal of scholarships to Dalit players.
