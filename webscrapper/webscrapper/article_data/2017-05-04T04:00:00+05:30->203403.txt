Vadodara: The sessions court on Wednesday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Jigisha Agnihotri, who cheated an elderly woman of Rs 48 lakh along with her husband Chirayu.

 The accused couple, residents of Srinagar Society in Akota, told complainant Sumitra Parmar that they are proprietors of Balaji Trading Company and would process her loan of Rs seven lakh which she needed so that she could get a house in Subhanpura. 
 
 She also needed the money to repair her ancestral house in the village.
 
 Police told the court that they made Parmar sign some papers at sub-registrar’s office in Akota and the loan papers at Sayajigunnj branch of Vijaya Bank. It was later known that they had made Parmar applied for loan of Rs 48 lakh and after paying Rs 7 lakh to her siphoned off remaining amount, police said.
 
 The detection of crime branch (DCB) had registered the case against the duo.
 
 The police requested the court to reject Agnihotri’s application since she is absconding and they also need to record her statement since she is the key accused in the offence. 
 
 Police also argued that there could be a possibility that Agnihotri would have conned several other persons with a similar modus operandi for which her custodial interrogation is also necessary.
