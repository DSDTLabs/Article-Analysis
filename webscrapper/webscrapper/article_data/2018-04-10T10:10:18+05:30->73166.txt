 LUDHIANA: Raikot based couple   and Mohinder Singh’s world came crashing down when both their sons died together in 2010. Their elder son got electrocuted and in a bid to save him the 2nd son was also grasped in the jaws of death. The children were aged 21 and 20 years respectively. To fill the gap created in their lives by the cruel hand of destiny the couple went to many doctors and religious places but to no avail. But finally after a gap of eight years their wish was fulfilled and twin girls were born to the couple at a local hospital after they opted for IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation).
 
 Sukhwinder, conceived in the very first cycle and the couple are now   of twin girls. “We both feel like our children have returned to our lives. We had lost all hope of having kids again in our life as we had been trying every kind of treatment anybody would recommend to us but all in vain” they said with the tears in their eyes. The duo thanked Dr   and the staff of Rana hospital for making their dreams come true
 
 Speaking to TOI about the case Dr. Vijaydeep Kaur, IVF specialist who successfully handled this case said, “It was a very challenging case considering the age of the couple and the fact that the female was post menopausal. Even the maintenance of twin pregnancy in this patient at this age was difficult because she developed pregnancy induced hypertension and was on bed rest for about a month. Due to meticulous care she was able to complete 8 months of pregnancy and gave birth to twin females,their birth weights were 2.3kg and 1.6 kg” She further added, “These kind of cases give you satisfaction as an IVF specialist that by the grace of god you can bring happiness back in someone’s life"
