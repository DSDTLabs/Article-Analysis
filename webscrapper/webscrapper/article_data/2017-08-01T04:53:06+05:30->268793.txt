GURUGRAM: Power woes returned to haunt parts of Gurgaon on Sunday and Monday, after feeder breakdowns tripped supply lines, leading to outages in areas, including sectors 3, 5, 6 and 56.

  2 residents complained of prolonged power cuts, and alleged the discom had failed to check outages in their area. “The problem seems systemic,” said Ranjan Kumar, a resident of Block C, Sushant Lok 2. 
 
 “We are without electricity for six hours, and yet, there’s no official word on where the problem had occurred or when it will be rectified. We asked the discom officials to share the details with us, so that we can prepare our schedule accordingly,” Kumar added.
 
 Residents of sectors 3, 5 and 6, on Monday, said they had to cope with an outage that lasted over eight hours. “We were hoping such outages won’t happen any more, since the discom said it’s carrying out maintenance to augment the system. But once again, the cuts have persisted,” said Dinesh Vashisht, president of the RWA covering sectors 3, 5 and 6.
 
 When TOI called the South City sub-divisional officer, Dharam Singh, for comment, he said there was a breakdown in the 66 kV sub-station in Sector 56. “It was rectified in two hours,” he said.
 
 Sub-divisional officer of New Palam Vihar, Manpal Dhool, however, denied that any prolonged outage had taken place in sectors 3, 5 or 6. “There was a one-and-a-half hour outage, because of rains. But we fixed the fault in two hours.”
 
 Dinesh, however, contested this version, saying almost 1,100 homes in these sectors faced   of up to seven hours on Monday.
