 is reportedly worried about her brother Blanket's living arrangements. The 19-year-old aspiring   is said to be upset with her late father  's sister Rebbie, as Paris feels she is trying to stop the 'Thriller' hitmaker's brood - also including 20-year-old Prince - from seeing their grandmother  .

  
  
 The 86-year-old matriarch is staying at Rebbie's leaving Blanket practically alone at his grandparent's Calabasas property. Katherine has been away from her home for months having been in London for two months in January before returning to Los Angeles. 
 
 This has sparked concern in Paris as Michael's choice of guardians in Katherine and 38-year-old cousin   are not looking after Blanket. 
 
 TJ Jackson and his spouse Frances Casey are said to be sharing the role as supervisory guardians of the teenager and check up on how he's getting on at his grandmother's, but Paris doesn't think they are doing enough.
