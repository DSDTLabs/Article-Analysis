AURANGABAD: The   rural police will establish two fuel stations on the   highway at   and   to supplement its welfare fund.

 “By setting up fuel stations, we intend to supplement the police welfare fund in a non-controversial manner,” said Aarti Singh, superintendent of police, Aurangabad rural.
 
 Singh has sought permission from the office of the director general of police to set up the fuel stations. She said the stations would start function in two to three months.
 
 Reckoning the flow of traffic on the highway, the two fuel stations together are expected to contribute around Rs 3 lakh per month to the welfare kitty.
 
 The infrastructure of the fuel stations would be developed by a petroleum company. The welfare department of rural police would deploy private staffers at the stations. “We will be sharing the profit with the petroleum company,” said Singh.
 
 The Aurangabad city police had set up a petrol pump beside the officie of the superintendent of police (rural) office in 2005.
 
 An officer privy to the development said, “The SP is of the view that taking   funds might bring some unwarranted requests from those giving the funds. And if the requests are not considered, it appears that the police are ungrateful.”
