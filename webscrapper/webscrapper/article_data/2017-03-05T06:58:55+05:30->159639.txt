KOLKATA: Going against the trend of increasing seats every year, the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST) will again reduce intake this year. The technology institute will go for a 10% seat cut for the 2017-2018 session, bringing down the number to seats to 585. Last year it had admitted 650 students.The proposal has been cleared by the its board of governors.

 In its earlier avatar as   , the institute had a total seat count of 484.
 
 The prestigious institute will reduce seats for the second year in a row to make up for the excess intake in 2014-15 and 2015-2016 academic sessions.
 
 Once it was upgraded to II EST in 2014-15, the technology school was asked by the Centre to admit 735 students, or 14% more than it could handle, to factor in the 27% OBC quota. But IIEST withdrew before the last round of counselling, finally admitting only 630. In the 2015-2016 session, too, the   wanted the institute to admit 735, but IIEST could only offer 620 seats. Finally , for 2016-2017, IIEST formally decided to cap the intake at to 650.
 
 “In both 2014 and 2015, we tried to accommodate more students following the MHRD directive. As a result we had to ask several outstation students to make their own living arrangements despite IIEST being a residential campus. It also had to convert old quarters into academic blocks. In order to improve infrastructure and offer better facilities to students, the institute recommended to its board of governors a cut in intake for both 2016 and this year,“ a senior IIEST official revealed. It was initially proposed that IIEST would implement the 27% OBC quota in a stagge red manner over three years. But the HRD ministry advised it to implement the quota at one go, putting enormous pressure on infrastructure.
 
 “Had we accommodated the prescribed strength of 735, the total student strength in the institute would have gone up to 4,000. But the MHRD while upgrading IIEST had limited the total student count to 3,500 including undergraduates, postgraduates and doctoral students. Now that we have introduced an exit route for fourth-year BTech students from 2017, we hope to accommodate the recommended intake from 2018,“ the official said.
 
 In 2012, the Centre had promised Rs 592 crore over the first five years for upgrading the institute.
 
 “Half the money was to be spent on building laboratories, classrooms, libraries, auditoriums, hostels and residential quarters. But till 2016, we received only around Rs 120 crore.As a result, adequate infrastructure could not be built. In 2017, we are likely to get almost Rs 99 crore, which we hope to spend on recurring and non-recurring expenditure. We require around Rs 300 crore for non-recurring expenditure to construct student hostels, academic space and laboratory development,“ the official said.
