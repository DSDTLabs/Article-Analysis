MUMBAI: Frequent instances of drug dealing and crimes involving drug addicts have pushed the   (GRP) to focus on   and form a 100-member patrolling team jointly with the city police force. The brief given to the team is to flush out peddlers and consumers from railway premises and ensure they are kept at bay. The team will comb the yard, loop lines and station areas at all times in the day.

 “The yard at Sandhurst Road had turned into a hub of sorts with peddlers squatting on the tracks, making deals. The large tract of space gives them an opportunity to meet customers in private as well as find a hiding place if cops come looking,” said DCP (GRP)  . This problem is not experienced at other railway stations.
 
 “Officers from the   GRP outpost and the CST GRP outpost have jurisdiction over harbour and main lines at Sandhurst Road. They have joined hands with Dongri police which has jurisdiction over the yard. Combing operations and patrolling began three days ago. The focus will be on nabbing African  ,” added Pawar. Six to seven different teams of policemen have been formed. Drug consumers won’t be spared either.
 
 
  
  
 
 In May 2016, Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel had caught a Nigerian national carrying narcotics from the railway tracks between Sandhurst Road and Masjid stations.   had to be chased by officers as he started to run on the tracks. Five Sim cards and some pills were recovered from him.
 
 “Addicts are involved in maximum instances of mugging and molestation on trains. In October 2017, a drug addict was arrested at CST for masturbating inside a local while staring at a woman in an adjacent coach,” said a railway police officer.
