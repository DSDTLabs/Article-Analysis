Salem: Have you ever heard of any water tap that has been working properly for 100 years without developing any issues? It was double delight for residents as two water taps on Soundamman Koil Street near Palapattarai Mariamman temple at Ammapet in the city completed 100 years on Thursday that too with a clean water running history. 

 “The taps were installed on May 10, 1918, by Gurusamy Chettiyar,” said Esan D Ezhilvizhiyan, a member of Salem Historical Researchers Association (SHRA), which recently came to know that the taps had a 100-year old history. According to him, Gurusamy Chettiyar laid the pipelines for the residents when they faced potable water scarcity and set up the taps at Soundamman Koil Street.
 
 One of the residents said the taps and pipelines were in good condition till date. “More than 500 residents are using the two taps,” said A T Mohan, a resident.
 
 SHRA members had recently repaired a portion of the wall in which the taps were fitted and repainted it. 
 
 The SHRA members also honoured the siblings of Gurusamy Chettiyar at a function organised on Thursday.
