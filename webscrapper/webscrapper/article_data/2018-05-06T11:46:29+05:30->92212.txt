CHANDIGARH: The resurfacing work at the Chandigarh airfield is going on at a fast pace. The process of resurfacing of the runway has been divided into three main phases. Spokesperson of the local air force station said the process should get over by May-end and is subject to changes in weather conditions and regular availability of raw material. 

 Phase I would see the improvement of 7200 feet of bitumen surface of the runway which involves laying of eight separate layers of Dense Asphaltic Concrete (DAC). The work related to phase-I will be undertaken on Sunday night. End of phase I will provide longer operating hours during day for flights operations.
 
 Phase II involves improvements and extension of runway ends to extend the runway from the existing 9,000 feet to 12,400 feet. During this phase while flight operations would continue during the day, the length of usable runway would be restricted to 7,200 to 8,000 feet. End of Phase-II (Approximately by end of 2018) would permit regular day operations on an extended length of the runway.
 
 Phase III involves installation of runway lights and other navigational aids. End of phase III will permit unrestricted day and night operations at Chandigarh airfields. Completion of phase III is expected by the first half of 2019.
 
 The process of resurfacing works at the runway of the Chandigarh airport, which is mainly controlled by the air force, has been undertaken by the first time after the airfield was established in Chandigarh in 1961 as a major air logistics node of Indian troops deployed in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 The second closure of runway for the flight operation from May 12 to 31 would see the laying of the top layers of the bitumen runway surface.
