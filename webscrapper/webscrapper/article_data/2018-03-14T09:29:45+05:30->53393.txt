The star war has got hotter in the state with   taking a dig at his tinsel town rival-turned political opponent  's 'silence on several issues'. 

 Rajinikanth, who is on a spiritual trip to the   to "realise oneself", on Tuesday shot back, "I have not become a full-time politician. I have not announced my party. I don't want to talk anything about politics (now)." He was speaking to reporters at the Dayanand Saraswati Ashram.
 
 The exchange between the actors is seen as an indication that they would not hesitate to pull punches to stake claim for the political pie. Fans of both actors though are cautious. "There's nothing much to read into   sir's statement. This shouldn't be blown out of proportion," said  , president of Sulazhum Suravali Rajnikanth Makkal Manram in Coimbatore.
 
 Responding to a query from reporters on Monday about Rajnikanth not commenting on the   issue, Kamal said in Coimbatore that the superstar maintains silence on several other issues too. "So it not correct to say that Rajni is silent on Cauvery issue alone," he said. The comment was widely seen as the first signs of political tension between the two.
 
 Politicial analysts say that in the coming days the   political equation would degenerate from the friendly criticisms to scathing attacks. "Kamal and Rajni cannot supplement each other. Sooner or later, when electoral victory becomes the priority, they have no choice but to take on each other. When that happens, fans cannot afford to be cordial with their rivals," said journalist 'Tharasu' Shyam.
