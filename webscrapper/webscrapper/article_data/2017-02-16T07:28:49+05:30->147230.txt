JUNAGADH: Scientists at Junagadh Agriculture University’s (JAU) wheat research station have successfully developed a new variety of wheat that is heat tolerant and suitable for growing in saline soil conditions. What’s more, the new variety would enhance the taste of chappatis and would be best suited for making breads!

 The discovery is expected to come as a boon for large number of farmers who have to take desperate steps to salvage their standing crop even when temperature rises by even few notches. Moreover, the new variety named GJW 463 also yields more wheat per hectare as compared to the exisiting varieties, scientists said. 
 
 Dr AR Pathak, vice chancellor, JAU told TOI: “Many farmers in Saurashtra sow wheat as early as last week of October to avoid the impact of unpredictable heat and drought periods on germination. They also want to take advantage of available irrigation water in the well or bores in the beginning of Rabi season. In later part of the season, these main water sources ar exhausted. Therefore, there was a need to have better yielding varieties with quality grains suitable for early as well as timely sowing conditions which can replace older varieties. We have successfully developed new   variety which is heat tolerance and can withstand salinity too.”
 
 Dr  , a scientist at the wheat research station, said, “Climate change has become a serious threat for agriculture and development of such variety was the need of the hour. The new variety gives more yield per hectare as compared to all popular wheat varieties in the state besides it is heat and salinity tolerance qualities.”
 
 “If this variety is sown in first week of November, farmers can get 55.75 quintal per hectare and during regular sowing season (November 15 to 25), they can harvest 50.91 quintal per hectare,” said Dabhi.
 
 The qualities of this new variety have been approved under All India Coordinated Research Project.
