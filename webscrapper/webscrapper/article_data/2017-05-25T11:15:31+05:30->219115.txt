SURAT: The   Youth Action Force (DYAF) has called off the Daman bandh on May 26 seeking the release of its chairman Umesh Patel, who is under police custody for last 15 days. 

 The DYAF had given the bandh call demanding the release of Patel, who was is placed under police custody for not signing a bond stating that he would not take out the rally and disturb the peace by the Daman’s sub-divisional magistrate Nilesh Gaurav. 
 
 Daman had observed bandh following Patel’s announcement on April 15 to protest the   high court’s suggestion to merge Daman with Gujarat. The high court had made the suggestion while refusing to quash FIRs against liquor shop owners of Daman. The Gujarat government had earlier told the court that 90% liquor smuggled into Gujarat comes from Daman. 
 
 However, Patel was detained by the Daman police for two days after of the Daman bandh till April 17. Daman’s sub-divisional magistrate Nilesh Gurav issued a notice to him and told him to sign a bond stating that he would not take out the rally and call off the bandh. He claimed that Patel’s campaign would disturb peace.
 
 Talking to TOI, Khurshid Manjra, who led the protest march in Daman on April 15 in the absence of Patel, said, “Patel has been placed under police custody for last 15 days following the orders of sub-divisional magistrate. Earlier, we had announced Daman bandh on May 26, which has been cancelled. Now, we will be knocking the doors of Gujarat high court for the unlawful arrest under IPC section 151.” 
 
 Manjra said, “Umesh has gone on indefinite hunger strike in the police custody since two days. It is time for the administrator of Daman and Diu, Praful Patel to take a lenient move and understand that we are not here to disturb the peace of our own people, but we are here to fight for the injustice and rights of the people.”
