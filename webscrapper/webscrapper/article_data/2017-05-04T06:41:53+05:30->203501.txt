MUMBAI: A 32-year-old   from Andheri was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly sexually abusing two minor girls, days after he was released on bail in a rape case. 

 The Sahar police booked the accused, Dinesh Panchal, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He has been remanded in police custody. 
 
 On Tuesday, Panchal targeted two girls, both aged six, in Sahar village, said a police officer. "He lured the two girls with chocolates to an isolated spot on MMRDA ground and sexually abused them," claimed the officer. When the mother of one of the girls spotted him and raised an alarm, he fled. The parents of the two girls then filed a complaint. 
 
 Locals have caught Panchal several times in the past trying to molest minor girls, claimed the Sahar police. tnn
