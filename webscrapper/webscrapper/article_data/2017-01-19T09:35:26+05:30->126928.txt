MANALI: Emergency flights that connect the remote   with   have not been able to fly even once this winter due to inclement weather.

 The first sortie was scheduled for January 15, but heavy snowfall and low visibility over the Pir Panjal range have not allowed choppers to take off from Kullu. Nearly 250 people are waiting in Kullu for the chopper to fly them to various parts of Lahaul, while a similar number is waiting in Lahaul. The chief minister's chopper is the only option for residents, government employees and workers to go to Lahaul or come out of the valley .
 
 The liaison officer for the chopper at Kullu, Yog Raj Dhiman, said they were hoping to start the sorties from Thursday if weather was good. “We have received the schedule for two sorties from Kullu. The first sortie is for Stingri helipad and the second is for Udaipur helipad. About 20 passengers per flight will be taken to both the helipads, and similar number will be brought back,“ he said.
 
 People in medical emergency are lifted on priority. According to Dhiman, about 250 people are in queue to get their pass to the flight and this number could cross 1,000 by the season's end. Lahaul and Spiti district administration has launched an online flight-booking facility for residents to book or cancel tickets, and check the status of their turn. As most of the flights get suspended due to inclement weather in the region, many people never get a chance to ride the chopper till May, when the road to Lahaul opens after snow clearance by   (BRO).
 
 Lahaul has 10 working helipads at Udaipur, Tindi, Stingri, Tingret, Baring, Chokhang, Rawa, Tandi, Jispa and Sissu.A helicopter is yet to land at Gondhla helipad. Depending on demand, the chopper from Kullu will conduct sorties to   and Bharmaur in Chamba district.
