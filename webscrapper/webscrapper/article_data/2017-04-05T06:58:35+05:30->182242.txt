HYDERABAD: The committee constituted by the Telangana government to regulate school fees has agreed to constitute district fee regulatory committees in the next academic year. All stakeholders, except members of the   (ISMA), have also agreed to have a common admission schedule for all schools. Members of   said a common schedule is not feasible for them as they have a lot of foreign students. 

 The committee met for the second time on Tuesday and discussed various clauses of the draft government order prepared by the school education department. In the two-hour long meeting member from the law department asked committee chairman Tirupathi Rao to ensure statutory status for district fee regulatory committees by passing a legislation in the Assembly. 
 
 The school associations agreed to put a limit of 5,000 for admission fee as per GO Ms No 1, 1994. But there was strong disagreement among school managements over fixing a percentage towards teacher salaries as per the GO, which says 50% of the fees collected by schools must be paid as salary to teachers. 
 
 While a majority of the clauses in the draft GO were agreed upon, a few points such as the criteria to be used by DFRC for fixing fees, percentage of   hike etc met with disagreements and each side placed their arguments. The next round of discussions by the committee on the remaining clauses of the draft GO will be held on April 6.
