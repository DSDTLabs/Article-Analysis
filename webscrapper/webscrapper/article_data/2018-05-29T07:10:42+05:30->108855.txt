VASCO: Nepal native  , 25, was arrested on Monday for stealing Rs 14 lakh from Karma Auto Park Petrol pump Chicalim. Kumari, a resident of Adarshnagar, Chicalim, worked as a cleaner in the first floor office of the pump. 

 Mormugao DySP Sunita Sawant said on Monday morning that when the staff arrived to open the office they realised that the window was broken and money was missing from the drawer. The owner was immediately informed and a complaint was made with the   police.
 
 Sawant said the accused broke the window to enter the office, then robbed cash from a drawer using a key and replaced the key. The CCTV camera shows a person wearing a cap taking away the cash. The police could not identify if the person was male or female. But they suspected the crime to be the work of one of the staff members. 
 
 While registering the statements of the staff, police noticed Kumariâ€™s hand was injured. She confessed to the crime during interrogation.
 
 She told the police that on Sunday she came to the office between 9.30pm and 10pm. She entered from the rear side of the building and used the staircase to get to the first floor. While she tried to remove the glass from the window but it broke and she was injured.
 
 Police recovered cash worth Rs 13,43,855 from her house. She had stitched the cash into a cushion for safekeeping. The cushion was placed in a suitcase. 
 
 The accused robbed the weekend collection of the petrol pump worth Rs 14,19,700. Police have collected her blood sample to match it with the stains in the office and those found near the suitcase. 
 
 Further investigations are under way.
