Indians are undoubtedly considered as one of the most efficient and hard working set of   in the entire world. But as per a latest study, commitment levels among   have declined sharply in comparison to the global average with Indians planning to leave their   in less than two years.

 According to the 2015 Michael Page India Employee Intentions report, 82 per cent or 4 out of 5 employees have confessed that they will switch their jobs in the next 12 months. Infact, 73 per cent of the surveyed employees actually admitted that they have appeared for various interviews during the last 12 months.
 
 On one hand, the employees must feel confident that the job market is so strong and healthy at a given time that everybody is sure about changing jobs. On the other hand, this must be saddening for the employers, who must have planned long-term with their star employees.
 
 A recce carried out by Randstad Workmonitor 2017, more than 30 per cent Indians changed jobs in the previous six months – that’s far higher than most other countries – though over 50 per cent worked with the same employers.
