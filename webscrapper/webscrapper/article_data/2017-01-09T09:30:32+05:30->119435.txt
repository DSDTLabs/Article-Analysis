PUNE: Happy Streets has proved to be a platform for entrepreneurs. A group of women residing in Kothrud have started food catering services inspired by the event.

 These homemakers, who visited the event last year, have now established their own brand `Tasty Treat'.
 
 “My daughter had come to the event last year. Since it was a first of its kind early morning road show, there were only a few food options for people.She could not get anything to eat after the event. This prompted my friends and me to put up a stall of homemade food at Happy Streets,“ said  , a group member.
 
 Harsha Korde, another group member said they got a good response.
 
 Inspired by it, they went professional with the food business. “We have been getting orders for different events now.We are really grateful to this event. It has boosted our confidence,“ said Korde. The group got support from their family and friends. They helped them set up the stall.
