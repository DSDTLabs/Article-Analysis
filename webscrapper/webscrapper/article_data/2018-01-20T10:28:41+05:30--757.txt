MUMBAI: When   prepares to run a marathon, she knows she can count on the support of her husband. Her father, though, is another matter. "He is not happy. He still insists I don't run," Genemo says with a smile. You wonder what could possibly be the reason. There is, after all, plenty of money to be made if you are good enough to compete with the best over 42kms. After all, Genemo's legendary compatriot   had told 
 last year, that an increasing number of runners in   and   were giving up long-distance running events in favour of the marathon mainly because of lack of money in the former.

 But Genemo explains why that fact is of no interest to her father. "His issue is running will damage my body. He tells me not to run because of that. The other things don't matter." Mumbai must bring back plesant memories for Genemo who won her first ever marathon here two years ago in a time of 2:27:50. But clearly, not everyone back home would have been celebrating her feat. Asked whether her husband's approval and assistance with training made him an unpopular figure with her father, Genemo, who also conquered the 2016 Vienna City Marathon, laughs. "Nothing like that. They are ok."
 
 Considering the couple live "far away" from Genemo's father back in Ethiopia, her marathon career seems safe for now.
