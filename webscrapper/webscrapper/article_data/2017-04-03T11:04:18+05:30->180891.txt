CHARMINAR: Activists are gearing up to spread awareness with regard to removing the role of an intermediary for zakaat funds ahead of  .

 In zakaat 2.5 per cent of one's annual savings is given to the poor. It is a form of charity which seeks to uplift those from the weaker sections so that they can improve their socio-economic conditions. Usually in Ramzan, tens of thousands of Muslims across the city calculate zakaat funds which they then hand out to those in need.
 
 “Several individuals charge large percentage of zakaat funds in the form of kaffaf. All we are saying is that instead of giving huge funds to such people for their institutions, give zakaat to your poor relatives. This is in accordance with the scriptures. It is important to help one's own relatives,“ said Mohammed Ilyas   from the  , an organisation which seeks to create awareness within the community on the issue. He clarified that the organisation is not against Muslims donating their zakaat to madrassas. However, the organisation has called for more accountability. “There were pe ople who said that they need to know how the funds that they have given to such institutions wre being used. That there is a need to bring about more transparency for the sake of the donor,“ Shamsi said.
 
 He also opined that some nazims of madrassas have been living a life of luxury. Teachers and students are not so fortunate.
 
 “While there are madrassas which work dedicatedly, there are other s where there is no uniformity. The teachers are paid a pittance whi le the nazim (principal) moves around in air-conditioned cars and live a more comfortable life,“ Shamsi said.
 
 Other activists like S Q   pointed out that zakaat funds should yield better results and that the money should be used to strengthen the community by using it for education.
 
 “We need to use the funds better instead of giving out doles. The community must come forward and spend them for education and healthcare, among other purposes.“
