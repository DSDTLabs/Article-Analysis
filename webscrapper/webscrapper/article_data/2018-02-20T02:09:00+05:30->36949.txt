Guntur: Municipal administration minister Dr P Narayana said that all the waste-to-energy plants, which have been planned in Guntur, Visakhapatnam and Tirupati cities, will be completed by December 2018. 

 He said they are setting up 10 mega waste-to-energy plants to cover 73 municipal towns in the state. The minister inspected the under-construction waste-to-energy   at Naidupet village on the outskirts of Guntur city on Monday.
 
 Narayana referred to the advanced countries like China and Japan, which have set up many   to energy plants to resolve the solid waste issue. 
 
 He said that Tokyo, the capital city of, Japan has nearly 22 such plants covering 23 divisions, while Singapore also has good number of waste to energy plants.
 
 “The waste to energy is a wonderful solution with twin benefits. While the plant consumes entire volume of solid waste being generated daily from the cities, it also generates money to the civic bodies,” said Narayana. He said that the management of solid waste had become a big headache for all the local bodies as there were no vacant lands to dispose of the garbage scientifically. 
 
 Although people are generating huge quantities of garbage, no one likes to have either a garbage bin or a dumping yard near their houses. 
 
 The minister said that scientific disposal of solid waste has also become an expensive proportion, which is eating into the money of civic bodies. 
 
 “The waste to energy plants once become successful in three major cities, it will be replicated across the state,” added Narayana.
