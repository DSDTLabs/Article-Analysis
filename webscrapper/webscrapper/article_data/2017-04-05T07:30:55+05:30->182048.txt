NAGPUR: Even though three months have passed since district court cleared way for   (NIT) to demolish the  , the civic agency is yet to undertake the exercise. NIT chairman   said that the anti-encroachment drive had not been undertaken in view of   and would be done now.

 There are 20 illegal restaurants on Futala lake waterfront. NIT plans to develop a musical fountain, light and multimedia show in the lake and 5,000 seating capacity gallery where these restaurants are situated at present, at the cost of Rs50 crore. It had earmarked a sum of Rs20 crore for this project as well as creating a sound and light show in Ambazari lake.
 
 NIT had leased out the premises to a local firm Sell Ads, which in turn leased out the space to these 20 restaurants. The project was controversial right from the beginning as Sell Ads had leased out land meant for parking. When this fact came to light the restaurant owners stopped paying rent to Sell Ads. The operator had allegedly used strong arm tactics in trying to evict them but was unsuccessful.
 
 NIT had signed an agreement with Sell Ads in August 2010. In September 2015, it gave an extension of one year to the operator with effect from August 2015. However, the operator challenged the extension order in urban development department (UDD) as it wanted an extension of 28 months. The one year extension granted by NIT came to an end in August 2016. However, in view of the pending appeal with UDD, no action was taken.
 
 The UDD finally in November 2016 decided the appeal in favour of NIT. However, by that time one of the restaurant owners — Shilpi Bagdi of Lake Side Grill — had moved the district court against her eviction from the premises. The court however, rejected the petition filed by Bagdi in December 2016. NIT should have immediately asked Sell Ads to vacate the premises but it did not do so for reasons best known to it. The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had also not given any relief to the shop owners.
