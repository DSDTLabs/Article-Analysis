AHMEDABAD: Union minister for petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra  , said that the prices of petrol and diesel will come down soon once the global scenario stabilizes. According to the Union minister, fuel prices have gone up due to a hurricane in the US.

 Addressing the media on the sidelines of the nationwide launch of LPG Panchayat, Pradhan said, "Prices of petrol and diesel have gone up recently due to the increase in international crude oil prices. This is primarily due to the hurricane in the USA due to which the production of refineries is severely hit."
 
 "As the prices go down in the international market, the prices will dip in India as well. Fuel prices in India have always been linked to the markets," he added.
 
 Pradhan said that the rates have already begun to drop in the past three days and will drop further in the days to come as the international scenario stabilizes. At the same time, Pradhan also said that there is likelihood of petroleum products being brought under the ambit of GST soon.
 
 When the minister was asked about the possibility of reduction in taxes on petroleum products to curb fuel prices, he said, "At present, taxes cannot be slashed as funds are required for development of infrastructure and proper implementation of welfare schemes."
 
 On Saturday, the Union minister launched ‘LPG Panchayat’ at Isanpur-Mota village in  , and handed over the ‘three croreth’ LPG connection to a villager. Side by side, Pradhan also mentioned of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Plus Scheme as part of which a corpus of funds will be created and used for providing new clean fuel connections in rural areas.
