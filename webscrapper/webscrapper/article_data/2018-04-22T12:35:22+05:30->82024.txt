Gone are the days when leading superstars enjoy the limelight while their wives are hidden away, and were said to be “protected” from fame, and a prying paparazzi. Buoyed by the success of his latest film ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’, Tollywood superstar   shared an image of him kissing his wife   on his Instagram page. 

 Unlike on the big screen, where Tollywood filmmakers are still reluctant to show kissing scenes, there was no filter or an object in-between or a sudden cut to the next scene. Mahesh uninhibitedly expressed his feeling of gratitude for his wife and didn’t mind sharing it with the world. 
 
 “Thankyou my love ❤ (sic),” the actor captioned the image, which has since gone viral on social media, with nearly 2 lakh likes within hours. 
 
 
  
 
 Mahesh’s sudden public display of affection for his wife comes after the spectacular success of his film  , in which he plays the role of the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister. The   directorial is raking in the moolah at the box-office, and is the fastest film to collect Rs 100 crore in Tollywood (excluding the Baahubali franchise). The film has also been a big success overseas, having collected $2 million in just two days. 
 Produced by DVV Danayya, the film also features   and Prakash Raj in important roles.
