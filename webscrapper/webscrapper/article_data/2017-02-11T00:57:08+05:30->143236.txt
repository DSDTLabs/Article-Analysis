MUMBAI: The   (BCAS) on Friday revoked the licence suspension of IndiGo Airline’s aviation   centre.

  A total of 1,400 flight attendants had passed security training exams fraudulently in the last eight months. They will take a refresher course and will appear for exams again. 
 
 Kumar Rajesh Chandra, BCAS chief, said IndiGo has given a written undertaking to correct all the wrongdoings at the centre. “The exams will henceforth be computer-based,”Chandra said.
 
  Last Friday, BCAS had suspended the licence after finding malpractices in the security training and exams the airline conducted for its flight attendants.
