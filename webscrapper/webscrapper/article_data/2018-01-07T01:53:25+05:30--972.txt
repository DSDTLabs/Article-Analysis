GHAZIABAD: A controversy has erupted over whether shots were fired in the air during a raid on an illegal soil mining unit in   on Thursday night, with senior administrative and police officials giving contradictory statements.

 While the sub-divisional magistrate of Loni claimed that a gang of illegal soil miners had fired in the air to escape the raid, the circle officer said it was the SDM’s bodyguard who fired from his gun when the miners challenged him. A senior police officer who was part of the raid has, however, ruled out any shots.
 
 The SDM’s bodyguard lodged a police complaint on Friday alleging that some members of the gang illegally extracting soil had fired in the air during the raid late on Thursday night. The police have, however, questioned the guard’s decision to lodge the complaint 18 hours after the incident.
 
 “The circle officer and I were sitting inside our car when four persons came in a vehicle and tried to stop my guard and other officials from carrying out the raid. Following an argument with my team, they fired in the air and fled,” said Induprakash Singh, the  . 
 
 Circle officer (Loni)   gave a conflicting version. 
 
 “There was no   from the other side. It was the SDM’s guard who fired shots in the air. He was some 300 metres away from us. It’s a serious matter. During the raid, there was no mention of lodging any complaint. After the operation, we went our ways,” Durgesh Kumar said.
 
 A senior police officer said the matter was being investigated. “The matter is suspect. If shots had indeed been fired, why did the official not approach the police immediately?” asked the officer.
