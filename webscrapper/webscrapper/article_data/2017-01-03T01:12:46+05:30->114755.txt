GURGAON: The   initiative to engage inmates of   in the production of cloth bags, as part of their   campaign, has come as a blessing in disguise for the 12 inmates under life imprisonment at the penitentiary. MCG, along with Red Cross, is using the proceeds from sale of the cloth bags to sponsor education of the children of these inmates. 

 According to Red Cross official Shyam Sunder, two students have already been sponsored under the initiative, and 10 more have been shortlisted. “We felt the children of these inmates deserve a better future. And what better way than to fund their education from the proceeds of this project,”he said. 
 
 He added the total cost of education per child is Rs 45,000 per year, of which the private school where the kids have been admitted, has agreed to give a rebate of Rs 15,000. As a result, MCG is funding Rs 30,000 per child. 
 
 The corporation launched the anti-polythene campaign, and later, started the project to produce cloth bags by inmates at Bhondsi jail. Since then, these cloth bags are being sold at a nominal price at major markets in the city, such as Sadar Bazar. Till now, the corporation has managed to sell or distribute around 1,20,000 cloth bags. 
 
 Making Gurgaon polythene-free is part of the bigger Swachh Gurgaon campaign. Though the corporation has undertaken several drives to impose the ban on plastic bags, the efforts have not met with much success so far. Plastic bags continue to be used widely by residents.
