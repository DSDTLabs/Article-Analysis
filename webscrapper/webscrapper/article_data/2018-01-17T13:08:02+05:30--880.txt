MARGAO: On the 51st anniversary of the historic Opinion Poll Day on Tuesday, TCP minister   said the GFP would adopt the objectives of the Opinion Poll movement as the standard narrative of the party’s ideology.

 “We (GFP) are the inheritors of the legacy of the stalwarts who fought for retaining Goa’s identity in the Opinion Poll movement...We are ready to go to war to take up the challenges facing Goa,” Sardesai said while highlighting the party’s “accomplishments” within less than a year of its inception. 
 
 He was addressing a public meeting “Asmitai Zagor” organized by his party at Lohia maidan,  . Earlier in the day, the party held a state-level event at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao.
 
 “The GFP has succeeded in bringing the Opinion Poll back into focus. And the focus is our identity — ‘Goem, Goenkar and Goenkarponn’,” he said. 
 
 Sardesai defined ‘Goenkarponn’ as the “marriage of Eastern and Western cultures”. “That is our Goan culture. And the Konkani language is the vehicle of that culture.” He, however, added that education in one’s mother tongue “doesn’t work”. “Don’t keep the people backward.”
 
 Minister for water resources, Vinod Palyekar, speaking on the occasion, pledged to protect the   river. 
 
 Minister for rural development   spoke on the need for affordable housing for Goans.
