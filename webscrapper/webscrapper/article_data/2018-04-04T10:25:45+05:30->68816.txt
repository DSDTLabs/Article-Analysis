HYDERABAD: Turning critical towards the   government for not filing a counter to the petition filed by the two   MLAs challenging their expulsions from the assembly, Justice B   of the Hyderabad High Court directed the government to file the same by April 6. The final hearing on the case will be held on April 9. The judge was hearing the plea filed by expelled Congress MLAs   and S A  . It may be recalled here that the judge had directed the authorities to furnish the video footage of the alleged assault on the council chairman on March 12 inside the Telangana Legislative Assembly.

 On Tuesday, when the case hearing resumed, Telangana additional advocate general   sought three more weeks time for filing the counter on behalf of the state. As far as the video footage is concerned, it cannot be furnished without a resolution from the   which now stands adjourned indefinitely.
 
 Though the state counsel termed the restraint order passed against the election commission asking it not to notify elections to the two assembly segments for the next six weeks as an order that will protect the interests of the expelled MLAs, the judge did not agree with it. “ I am bound by law. Where is the protection for the MLAs in that order? Anyway you file your counter by Friday”, the judge told the state counsel.
