 “The electrical wiring in the hospital is very old. The engineer who was assigned the work to look into the matter said similar incidents would happen if the wiring was not changed in the entire hospital. We have written to the health department as it will require Rs3 crore,” Dr Singh said. 
 
 He said the functioning in operation theatres of orthopaedic, ENT, eye and gynaecology departments had been affected due to smoke after the fire broke out on Tuesday evening. He also said the electrical connection to the OT of general surgery department was also snapped. A letter has been sent to the electricity department to restore power supply at the earliest. 
 
 Sources said although no operation was going on in the orthopaedic, ENT or eye OT at the time of fire, a caesarean section was being carried out in the gynaecology OT at that time. 
 
 HoD of gynaecology department, Dr Renu Rohatgi, said though the OT was functioning as usual, but the real problem arose when it was filled with smoke. “The doctors still completed the operation against all odds,” she said.
