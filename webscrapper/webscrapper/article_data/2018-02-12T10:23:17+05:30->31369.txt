JAIPUR: After tasting defeat on all three seats in recent bypolls, the under-pressure   government is all set to announce the chairpersons of working committees in   ( ). 

 As BJP government is sitting on the list of chairpersons, resentment in BJP councillors has increased manifold. According to sources, the government is likely to announce the names of 25 working committee chairpersons this week.
 
 "As the size of the city is increasing, the JMC has decided to constitute 25 committees that would run the municipal corporation. This time, three electrical committees would be put in place. For the first time, the JMC will also have a women uplifting committee. Similarly, a committee for sewerage maintenance and heritage conservation has also been proposed," said a source at JMC
 
 Last time, The JMC had constituted three sanitation committees for 91 wards of the city. The JMC might also constitute three electrical committees and three public lights committees. "The city has 91 wards and it is not possible for one committee to monitor the whole city. As three committees will be constituted, the work will be divided. One committee can easily monitor 30 wards," added the source. 
 
 As the BJP came with absolute majority, most of the councillors have started pushing their MLAs to become members and chairpersons of the committees. Many BJP councillors, who were not expecting their names in the committees, showed disappointment before the senior party leaders earlier.
 
 With only eight months remaining for the assembly elections, the BJP government is now planning to constitute governing committees of the (JMC).
