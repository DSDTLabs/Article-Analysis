PUNE: The Cyber crime cell of city police on Friday arrested 50-year-old Ravindra Kulkarni for allegedly duping seven women who were looking for life partners through matrimonial websites. His primary targets were divorcees and widows.

 Last year, Nashik police had arrested Kulkarni. “Kulkarni, however, had got bail. Before the Nashik police could get the bail order cancelled, he escaped,” said inspector Sunil Pawar.
 
 Assistant inspector   got a tip-off that Kulkarni had been staying at a plush residential complex in Dhayari since last two months.
 
 In 2015, Kulkarni approached a 44-year-old widow through a matrimonial website by posing as an NRI and working as associate vice-president Singapore firm. 
 
 He took Rs 15.69 lakh from her under various pretexts. However, the woman suspected his credibility after looking him up online. She learnt he had cheated several women in a similar manner. When she asked him to return her money and valuables Kulkarni threatened to kill her, following which, she lodged the complaint with   police station, Pawar said.
 
 Explaining Kulkarni’s modus, Pawar said, “All the women were economically sound. Posing as an NRI, he would gain their trust and demand money under various excuses. “Kulkarni has also been booked for rape too in one instance,” Pawar said.
