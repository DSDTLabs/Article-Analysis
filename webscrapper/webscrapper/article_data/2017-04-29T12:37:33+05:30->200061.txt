AMRITSAR: Former deputy chief minister   said on Friday that he was "disappointed on the state of development works initiated during the SAD-BJP government". He accused the incumbent   of playing with the sentiments of people. 

 Talking to   in Amritsar, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president said that he was "saddened after watching the development works which were carried out during his government being stalled". "The funds have been stopped, not a single brick has been laid ever since the Congress government came," he claimed.
 
 The former deputy CM said it appeared as if the government was taking some kind of revenge from the people of   who voted it to power. Reacting to the Congress's claims that the state coffers were empty, he said that it happened earlier as well but the SAD-BJP government never stopped the development works in the state. "It is the Congress's last term. The party is just not interested in doing any work," he alleged.
 
 Adding that there was no law and order in Punjab, Sukhbir said, "Every day Akali workers are being targeted. The present government has unleashed a drive against various unions in Punjab. Wheat lifting is not being done since new contractors have been given the lifting contracts. The Congress's liquor lobby has wrested control over liquor trade of Punjab. False cases were being slapped on Akali workers."
