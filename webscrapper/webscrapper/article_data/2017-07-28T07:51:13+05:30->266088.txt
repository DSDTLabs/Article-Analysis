KOLHAPUR: Raghunath Patil,   for a long time has asked the government to take a   on the loan waiver issue, if not, the farmers will not allow the ministers to enter their villages for the   on Independence day.

 Talking about the future course of action Patil said, “We expect the state government to waive of loans of the farmers instead of making new announcements everyday.”
 
 “If the government fails to take a step for the benefit of the farmers in the next two weeks, then we will start observing Chakka Jam agitation across the district starting from August 14,” he added.
 
 “We will not let any minister in the state attend the flag hoisting ceremony organised in the villages of respective districts,” he added.
 
 “We have appealed the farmers to not to fill up the loan waiver forms that the state government has been asking for. The state government and the concerned banks have details about the loan that farmers have taken so far. The authority should compile these information and based on this, they can disburse the funds for loan waiver instead of asking farmers to fill up the forms and submit it with the government,” Patil said.
 
 Talking about the additional burden and confusion the scheme will add Patil said that the state government should take information from the banks and clear their debts,” he added.
