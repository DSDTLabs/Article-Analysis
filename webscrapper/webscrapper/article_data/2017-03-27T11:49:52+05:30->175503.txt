KERI: A rock art site at  , in Quepem, with   as well as of wild animals, has come under threat from mining activity in laterite quarries.

 Carvings of four human figures and a wild animal have been discovered just 5km away from the rock carving site in Pansaimol, Sanguem, and three kilometres away from the Cazur rock carving site in Quepem. But, as no proper research has been carried out, nothing much is known about it. When Prakash Velip was minister of archaeology, archives and museum between 2000 and 2005, he visited this area. But, no steps were taken either to protect the site or notify it as a protected site.
 
 Vitthal Khandeparkar of Usagalimol, Pirla, who was instrumental in the discovery of the Pansaimol  , said, “According to villagers, the site is known as Bavaleachemol and they believe the figures carved on the laterite bed is of a husband, wife and their sons, since these human figures are in a row. There is no signboard to show directions to the site. Not much information is available with anybody about these carvings.”
 
 Ramdas Shetkar of Shiroli, Sattari, recently visited the site of the rock art at Pirla. He says, “Quarrying of laterite brick is going on in full swing and there is a possibility that mining activities, undertaken in a haphazard manner, may destroy these unique carvings forever.”
 
 Archaeologist, directorate of archaeology and archives, Varad Sabnis, said, “Figures of four human beings, four deers and one bull are carved on the Pirla site. This rock art is of a later period than the one at Pansaimol.”
 
 Director of archives and archaeology, Blossom Medeira, when contacted by TOI said, “We have to study these rock carvings. Our archaeologist, Sabnis, has visited the site and is studying about these carvings. After a detailed study has been conducted, the process of notifying it as a protected site can be initiated.”
