DARJEELING: An employee of   travelling on New Jalpaiguri-bound   was allegedly robbed of his luggage at Nimtita, some one and a half hour from  , around midnight on Saturday. 

  Jaydeep Mukherjee had planned a week-long sightseeing in Darjeeling with his family and friend Rittick Das. But, with his bag containing Rs 70,000 cash, three credit cards, a mobile phone, his voter identity card and return ticket gone, the Shibpur resident now wants to return home at the earliest. 
 
 "We had dinner around 10.30pm and went off to sleep. I woke up to a noise around midnight. Before I realized what was going on, a man ran away with my backpack. It was dark as we had switched off the lights. I could only see that he was wearing a cap," he said.
 
 Mukherjee dialled the Railway Security Helpline 182 and got down at Malda where he was advised to go to NJP station to lodge a complaint. "We came to know that robbers had struck in coaches S6 and S7 as well," said Mukherjee, who was in coach S5. - Deep Gazmer
