NEW DELHI:   leader   is often a soft target for trolls on social media, but the man brings it on himself. For example, do you believe the Congress vice president can't afford a new kurta, or at least have a torn one mended?
 
 No? Well, neither do the Twitterati.

  did him good and it appears he needs to keep his clothing-poverty analogies to a minimum for them to really have an effect.
 
 Or the Twitterati will lay into him like it did with his torn-kurta comment.

 Should people start a Rahul Gandhi kurta fund? They were generous.
 
 
  
  
 
 Nice rags, Rahul. Remember, don't play us for fools, they meant.
 
 
  
  
 
 Nice plane, Rahul.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Don't play kurta politics.
