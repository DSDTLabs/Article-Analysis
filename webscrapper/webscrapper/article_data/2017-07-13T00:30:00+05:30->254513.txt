Karwar: In a bid to help   stay abreast of its latest schemes, the   in Uttara Kannada has decided to leverage technology by using   to reach out to the peasants and farmers’ associations.

 Although the department is currently disseminating information about its schemes and programmes through advertisements or through the Raitha Samparka Kendras and its offices at the Hobli level, it has not been able to reach out to all the farmers. Communicating through instant messaging services such as WhatsApp is likely to fix this problem.
 
 Ramachandra Naik, a farmer in Kumta, said that the WhatsApp groups formed by the agriculture department helped them get solutions in real time. “The government is introducing a lot of schemes for the benefit of farmers, and it has to spend more money on advertising them. However, using  , they can reach all corners of the state. The WhatsApp groups also help us learn new farming methods,” Naik added.
 
 Joint director of agriculture department, Karwar, Honnappa Govinda Gowda said, “We have already formed 239 WhatsApp groups at the Hobli and gram panchayat(GP) levels in Uttara Kannada. We are creating new groups, and more farmers are being added to our network. We are able to keep the farmers updated about a variety of issues – new schemes, climate, crops that can be useful and information about the market. Officials of the Raitha Samparka Kendras, and assistant agriculture officers are the official group administrators for these WhatsApp groups.”
 
 Gowda said that the groups had become immensely popular among the farmers. “They are coming forward, and providing phone numbers, and want to be added in the group. This being done at no cost, and the government is not offering any financial assistance for it,” he added.
 
 The farmers, on the other hand, too are happy to receive information directly from an official source via WhatsApp as conveniently.
