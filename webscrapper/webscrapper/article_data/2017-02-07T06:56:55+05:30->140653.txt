CUTTACK: A court in Cuttack district rejected a plea by police to reopen a 2007 case in which stevedoring baron   was the prime suspect. The case pertained to assault on businessman   at his house at Jobra in Cuttack on September 16, 2007. 

 Though the judge   gave the order on January 20, the order copy reached the media on Monday. Last month, Malgodown police in Cuttack moved the court, seeking to probe suspected links of Mahimananda and his close aide Basant Bal in the alleged offence, whose final report was submitted by police towards the end of 2007. 
 
 Mahimananda, CMD of Odisha Stevedoring Limited (OSL) was arrested from Bangkok on December 25, 2016, for his alleged involvement in the murder of  , an executive of Seaways Shipping in Paradip in September. 
 
 Harihar Mishra had in 2007 alleged miscreants attacked him with sharp-edged weapons. 
 
 However, Mahimananda was not named in the FIR, police said. 
 
 In the order, copy of which is with TOI, the judge observed police cannot apply for reopening of the case. The investigating officer already filed the final report in 2007 clearly stating that they did not find any clue in the case and the same was accepted by court. "The fresh prayer by police after 10 years, seeking permission for re-investigation amounts to nothing but abuse of process of law," the order said.
 
 "We know police falsely implicated Mamihamanda in the Swain murder case. We also know the police are trying to harass him by digging out old cases, where police did not find any evidence against him," said an OSL functionary.
 
  In a related development, the   (Jagatsinghpur) on Monday rejected the bail application of Mahimananda Mishra.
