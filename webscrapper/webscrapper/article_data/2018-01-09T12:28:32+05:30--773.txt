KOLHAPUR: A female leopard was found dead at   village of   in Satara district on Monday.

 Rohan Bhate, honorary wildlife warden of Satara district, said that the leopard, around 4-year-old, might have died one day before it was spotted.
 
 “It (leopard) was spotted by a farmer,  , when he was on his way to graze animals on Monday morning. After he entered a sugarcane field, he spotted the leopard. He ran away and alerted the people. After villagers gathered, they found that leopard was not moving. When they approached the animal, they found that it was dead,” he said.
 
 “After the carcass was spotted, a panchnama was conducted followed by autopsy on the carcass and a chunk of meat — probably of a peacock — was found inside the stomach of the leopard. Internal bleeding was also spotted. Also, on the chin of the leopard, marks of   were observed. There is a possibility that a viper might have bitten that animal and that would have led to its death,” he added.
 
 According to forest officials, the samples of the animal's visceral organs have been collected and will be sent for forensic analysis to check whether the leopard was poisoned.
