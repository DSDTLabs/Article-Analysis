PUNE: The civic body would send tankers to the villages in the city’s periphery not getting water through the pipeline.

 The decision was taken at the general body meeting of the   (PMC) on Friday. The civic body provides water to these villages, but the water sources are contaminated because of garbage disposal.
 
 A group of elected members claimed that the move was not good for the citizens of Pune and the proposal should be scrapped. “The citizens of Pune are not getting water despite paying tax regularly, while the civic body is planning to provide water to the people (of the villages) avoiding the payment of tax. It will send a wrong message to the society,” said  .
 
 The corporators opposing the move said the payment of dues should be made mandatory for those people before starting the tanker service for the villages.
 
 BJP corporators supported the move, stressing the villagers were getting contaminated water. “The civic body’s duty is to provide water to the nearby villages. But water reaching through the pipeline is not worth using. So we have to find other modes of supplying water to them. The option of water supply via tanker is being explored,” said  , the leader of the House in the PMC.
 
 The civic body collectively lifts 14 to 16 TMC water from Khadakwasla, Varasgaon, Temghar and Panshet dams. The civic officials and elected representatives maintain that the city would require 19 TMC water a year, considering the impending merger of 34 fringe villages in the municipal limits.
 
 In 1984, the irrigation department had told the civic body to recycle treated sewage and supply it for irrigation. In 1997, water was allocated on the condition that the civic body would recycle 6.5 TMC of sewage and recycle it. The PMC has started the Mundhwa jackwell project, which releases 6.5 TMC treated sewage into the baby canal for agriculture.
