NEW DELHI: In a rare sight, JNU students who called a strike on Monday stopped everybody, including teachers, from entering various schools on the campus. While the agitators, affiliated to the groups like   and  , claimed the strike to be a success, several others said the coercive manner was against “the ethos of JNU”.

 The students were protesting against the UGC notification of May 2016 making interview the main criterion in the MPhil and PhD selection process. Nine students have already been suspended for “disrupting” the Academic Council meeting on December 26.
 
 “We had complete backing of the students belonging to the marginalised sections, several teachers and staff,” said  , a suspended student. 
 
 Earlier in the day, registrar Pramod Kumar tweeted that the “functioning of majority of students, staff and faculty of JNU is affected. Striking students should desist from this illegal activity”. Rahul Sonpimple, a BAPSA member, said, “If the regulation stays, hundreds of students won’t get admissions to JNU.”
 
 A tussle allegedly took place between protesters and School of Languages faculty member Makarand Pranjape, who claimed he was allowed entry only after holding “students’ feet to push them away”. 
 
 JNU Students’ Union will organise a referendum on Tuesday to gauge the students’ views on the regulations.
