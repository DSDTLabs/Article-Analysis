CHANDIGARH: The   government has managed to identify over four times more households liable to pay property tax in Ludhiana by using satellite imaging as part of a pilot project that will now be replicated in other major cities of the state. 

 The state government has tied up with Punjab Remote Sensing Centre ( ) for keeping a tab on illegal colonies in the state and also detecting tax evasion. For this, the centre has agreed to provide the service at a nominal price of Rs 1,100 per square km, which is actually the cost of imaging.
 
 Local bodies minister Navjot Singh   said his department was set to sign an MoU with the remote sensing centre to curb illegal construction in the state for a period of five years and also for better decision making, like realistic tax collection.
 
 In October 2017, the local bodies department had issued a notification giving a chance to residents to pay only principal amount of the property tax with 10% rebate and that, too, without any penalty or interest till January 15 if they hadn't paid any property tax.
 
 In 2016-17, Ludhiana MC had collected Rs 66 crore as property tax against the target of Rs 70 crore. Last month, against the target of Rs 100 crore, the MC had collected Rs 50 crore as property tax during the financial period of 2017-18.
 
 "With the application of this innovative technique no government official would be able to hide the real picture for personal gains and also that this technique would come in handy for taking effective decisions," said Sidhu.
 
 The facility will be used for satellite image-based mapping of unauthorised construction, updated property mapping of all corporations and development of spatial decision support system. The PRSC, an autonomous organization under the department of agriculture, government of Punjab, is the apex body in the state for all remote sensing, geographic information system and global positioning system related works.
