Lucknow: After issuing directives on ragging, APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University has now set up a sexual harassment committee to help students and staff subjected to any harassment in colleges. The seven-member committee is headed by Prof. Alka Tripathi, faculty from applied sciences department of Institute of Engineering and Technology, Lucknow. The other members of the committee are Seetha Lakshmi, faculty from IET’s electrical engineering department; Ritu Gulati from Faculty of Architecture; Suman Pandey, computer science faculty at Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology (KNIT), Sultanpur; Shahnaz Ayub, faculty from electronics engineering department of Bundelkhand Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET), Jhansi; Pragati Shukla from IET’s applied science and human rights department; and Arunima Verma from IET’s electrical engineering department.

 Dean, students’ welfare, Manish Gour, said “Anyone facing sexual harassment can report the incident to this committee. The name of the complainant will be kept confidential”.
 
 Earlier, the AKTU had issued directives to curb ragging and had asked all colleges to constitute anti-ragging squads. All students were asked to submit a self-declaration that disciplinary action will be taken against them if found guilty. Parents too will be held responsible for their kids’ misconduct.
 
 In accordance with the letter issued by joint director, technical education, the university said that if a case of ragging is reported from any institution, the director/ principal will be held responsible.
 
 The colleges were also directed to put up hoardings, posters and banners in prominent places on the campus to exhort students not to indulge in ragging.
