VADODARA:   witnessed ruckus in the wee hours of Friday morning when two groups clashed at the Manubhai Mehta Hall located inside the boys’ hostel main campus. 

 More than half a dozen bikes were damaged due to the clash but neither the hostel officials nor the police which had rushed to the spot have registered any complaint in connection to the violence at the hostel campus. Sources suggest that two groups of students including those hailing from Rajasthan and another hailing from Manipur clashed at the parking space of M M Hall after a couple of students from Manipur were allegedly subjected to racial slurs by the group hailing from Rajasthan. 
 
 Sources suggest that it was around 3 am on Friday morning that a group of youth having their domicile of Rajasthan hurled racial abuses against some students hailing from Manipur after which the clash started. 
 
 Pieces of damaged tubelights, liquor bottles were also captured in photographs but warden of the hall Sanjay Solanki said that the things were brought under control soon. 
 
 Solanki in fact claimed that the clash had nothing to do with racial comments and that two students from Manipur had entered into heated arguments and a group from Rajasthan was trying to calm them down. 
 
 Like always, the hostel officials have failed to take CCTV footage into consideration. “Since, it was dark, the CCTV cameras have not been able to capture the entire sequence of incidents,” said Solanki.
