TV actor   was robbed of belongings worth `4 lakhs, which included cash, a newly purchased mobile phone, his earnings and   jewellery on Sunday. The actor had recently set up a stall with his sister in an exhibition and had kept money for the rent in a bag, when one of the customers who visited the stall walked away with it.
He said, “My sister was at the counter. As we had to give the rent for the stall, we had withdrawn `5,0000 rupees from the bank. We had kept the money in the bag, which had some gold ornaments along with some earnings from the stall and a mobile phone. A group of four ladies visited our stall. One of the ladies then stole the bag, which was kept on the counter, while my sister was busy with the others. Thankfully, I got the   footage of the exit door. It was visible in the footage that one of the ladies, was carrying my sister’s bag . It’s really sad when someone steals our hard-earned money.”
 Meanwhile, a complaint was lodged at the   police station.
