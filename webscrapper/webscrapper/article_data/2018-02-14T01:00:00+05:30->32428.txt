In this age of social media and instant gratification, the charm of old-world romance is hard to come by. However, Onir’s upcoming directorial, ' ', promises to bring it back.

 The love story features debutante   as an RJ, who floors the audience with his poetry and baritone. Paired opposite him is National Award-winning actress  , who plays a meme artist — a modern, free-spirited girl, who is unafraid to follow her heart.
 
 The movie revolves around the two, who are trying to find love while dealing with their inhibitions and insecurities — something that the current generation will be able to relate to. They connect over a wrong number and then, their romance blossoms on social media. 
 
 The light-hearted film, the makers claim, is perfect for viewing with your special someone this Valentine’s week. Another highlight of the movie is that it features a recreated version of the evergreen   hit, 'Pehla Nasha'.
