GURUGRAM: The makeover of   into a   will take at least six more months to complete. Around 90% of the work is complete and  , which is executing the project, has got a   extension from   to complete the remaining work. This is the third extension of deadline.

 DLF says it is confident of completing the project within the next few months. “Work on the underpass and U-turn near Cyber Park, one of the major congestion points, is near completion and we will not need any further extension of the deadline,” a DLF spokesperson told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 The underpass, which is also a part of the expressway project, is a crucial link between NH-8 and Iffco Chowk as it will take traffic directly from Delhi to MG Road. Currently, commuters have to take a detour around Cyber City to get to MG Road, creating a huge bottleneck during peak hours. “We are expecting to complete the work on this underpass very soon and it will ease out traffic in Cyber Hub and nearby areas,” he said.
 
 The 16-lane expressway is an 8.3-km signal-free corridor linking NH-8 with Golf Course Road. Claiming some of the components of the project like the Phase-5 underpass, which was introduced later, as the main reasons for missing the December deadline, the DLF spokesperson said, “Work started late on this section, so this portion of the project was delayed. Remaining works are in very advanced stages.”
 
 According to the developer, re-laying water, sewerage and electricity lines was also a challenge as services had to be restored without disturbing the people living on Golf Course Road. “People should appreciate that such a big project was executed without disturbing the people living in the area,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said, “We had received request for extension of the deadline and we approved it.”
