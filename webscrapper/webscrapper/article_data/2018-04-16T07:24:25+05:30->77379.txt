PUNE: The Bombay high court has directed the   police to keep track of the wellbeing of a young couple (names withheld), who recently approached the court for protection, fearing a violent reprisal from the girl’s family for marrying against their wishes.

 A division bench of Justice R M   and   has posted the matter for next hearing on May 2 after directing the police to record the complaint of the petitioners. Police sub-inspector   from the Hadapsar police was present in the court during the hearing.
 
 The HC order stated on April 12, “The senior inspector of police, Hadapsar police station, Pune is directed to depute a head constable to visit the place where the petitioners are residing every second day at 10am and report the well-being of the petitioners. If the apprehension is expressed by the petitioners as regards their safety, security etc., then the senior inspector of police, Hadapsar police station, Pune may take appropriate precautionary/remedial measures.”
 
 Lawyer  , who is representing the couple, told TOI, “With incidences of honour killings getting reported frequently in the recent past, the woman had feared that her parents and her family members may resort to violence as she had married against their wishes. This had prompted the young couple to move a writ petition in the high court.”
