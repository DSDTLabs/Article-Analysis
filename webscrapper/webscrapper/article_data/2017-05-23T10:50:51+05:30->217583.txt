After winning over audience’s hearts as Byomkesh and Satyabati,   Chatterjee and   are pairing up again as a young married couple for Arindam Bhattacharya’s Flat No. 609. 
Giving us a peek into the mystery drama, the director who made his debut with Antarleen, said, “The couple (Abir-Sohini) seeks a broker’s help (Rudranil Ghosh) to find a rented house. Despite enthusiastically showing them several properties around the city, the broker is in a hurry to close the deal. After much quibbling and deliberation, the couple finally moves into a posh complex apartment in Rajarhat. While the husband, who works in a renowned IT company, is ambitious and career-driven, his wife is on a sabbatical and looking forward to settling down in their new flat. Soon enough, the couple gets acquainted with their new 
 neighbours.”
 However, the two of them gradually start observing something peculiar among the residents of the complex. Their otherwise happy relationship begins to fall apart. Both of them have a hunch that it has a lot to do with the weird atmosphere of their surroundings. “The film has a mind-twisting plot and the mystery is unravelled only towards the end,” informed the director who has himself penned the film’s story, screenplay and dialogues.
 Sohini, who loved Antarleen, is kicked about the mystery the script offers. “I like the fact that there are a lot of mind games involved in this psychological thriller. Its mysterious plot is bound to keep the audience glued to the screen. My character has lots of shades too. Besides, after appreciating us in a period drama, hopefully the audience will love to see Abirda and me together in an urban flick this time,” she said.
 Abir, on his part, added, “The script has a lot of potential and I am sure Arindamda will do a swell job with it.”
 The film, which also stars Soumitra Chatterjee, Mamata Shankar, Kharaj Mukherjee and Rudranil Ghosh, among others, will go on the floors from August 16.
