Union minister and   MP   got into a scuffle with police on Thursday after he was stopped from entering his constituency where prohibitory orders have been clamped. 

 Supriyo later filed a police complaint alleging assault by IPS officer Rupesh Kumar. His complaint was turned into an FIR, sources said. The police, too, filed two separate FIRs against Supriyo for violating Section 144 imposed in the area and allegedly attacking Kumar.
 
 Home minister Rajnath Singh later called up Supriyo to enquire about the developments. The MP apprised him of the dayâ€™s development and also claimed he had been hit by bri-cks thrown by miscreants.
