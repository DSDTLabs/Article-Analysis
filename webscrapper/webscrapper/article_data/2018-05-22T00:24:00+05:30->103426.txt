Erode: Following heavy rain and strong wind on Sunday evening, about 10 trees were uprooted along the Lower Bhavani Canal near Modakkuruchi and its surrounding villages. 

 Even some century-old trees could not withstand the rain that started around 5.30pm. Some trees fell across the canal while other on village roads affecting traffic between villages, including Modakkuruchi, Avalpoonthurai, Thottipalayam, Aiyyagoundanpalayam, Chinnasamypuram, Kovilpalayam, Kattur, Vadukanur and Unjalur.
 
 Residents urged the public works department (PWD) officials to clear the trees at the earliest. 
 
 Meanwhile, PWD officials said they had already sent a team along with woodcutters and an earthmover to remove the fallen trees within a day.
