NEW DELHI: The England cricket team is back in India, a spring in their step and with renewed hope of getting a so-far elusive win on board against the hosts (OK, so they won the first warm-up, but can you read much into it?) since the time that Alastair Cook’s Test squad landed here in the first week of November.

 Following a gap after the five Test matches, England flew home for Christmas and New Years and the limited-overs specialists are back for the upcoming series that begins in Pune on January 15 with the first of three ODIs.  , who opted out of the tour to Bangladesh in October, returns at the helm for England and he and his squad face not just the home favorites - now led by  , following MS Dhoni giving up the captaincy - but the weight of history. 
 
 England have only won one bilateral ODI series on Indian soil, which was back in 1984-85. Since then, two series have been drawn while India have won four in a row, dating back to 2006. Of 41 bilateral ODIs against India in India, England have won 14 and lost 27. It is not a record to look at with much optimism, especially when you isolate the last decade which features 13 defeats (two 0-5 whitewashes included), two victories and a tie. 
 
 Now returning as England seek a first ODI series win in India since 1984-85, Morgan drew optimism from the team’s excellent ODI form since a woeful 2015 World Cup, as well as their run to the final of the ICC World Twenty20 in India last year. Since exiting the 2015 World Cup, Morgan’s England have won 19 off 31 completed ODIs while losing 11 and playing out one tie. In this time, they have won series against Pakistan (home and away), New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh while losing to South Africa and Australia by identical 2-3 margins. 
 
 In these, Morgan the batsman has scored 1082 runs in 27 innings at an average of 45.08 and strike-rate of 96.7, with one century and nine fifties. In six ODIs in India, dating back to the 2011 World Cup, Morgan averages 20.20 with a best of 41.
 
 Of the aforementioned seven series since the World Cup, only two have been played in Asia - the 3-1 win over Pakistan in the UAE and 2-1 in Bangladesh last October. Across these seven ODIs, Jos Buttler scored the most runs (322 at 64.40) followed by Jason Roy (217 in six innings); the next closest to 200 runs was   (171 in four innings). Four England batsmen managed centuries - Buttler, Roy, Hales and Ben Stokes. With the ball, only two bowlers took at least 10 wickets - Adil Rashid (14) and Chris Woakes (10). 
 
 These are not wholly encouraging figures for England as they face India for this short three-ODI series, but Morgan has backed his team to succeed. "The side that we'd had over the past two years has done some very special things and they have not played ODI cricket in India together," he said after captaining the tourists to victory over India A in Mumbai this week. "Beating India would be a great achievement and it's a huge challenge, but I wouldn't write us off. They are not unbeatable, but we will have to play very, very well in order to beat them."
 
 India are ranked third in the ICC ODI Championship and England fifth. In T20Is, India are second and England sixth. England won a one-off T20I in 2011-12 and the last series, in 2012-13, was shared 1-1. 
 
 The ODIs will be played in Pune (January 15), Cuttack (January 19) and Kolkata (January 22). The T20Is will be held in Kanpur (January 26), Nagpur (January 29) and Bangalore (February 1). The Kanpur T20I is scheduled to start at 4:30pm IST owing to the possibility of fog in north India, and the other two games at customary 7pm.
