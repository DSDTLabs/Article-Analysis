Singer   got teary-eyed in the first   video after receiving over   in her face.

 According to a report, the video for   - Underwood's first single from her forthcoming sixth studio album - finds the star crying in the shower before making a triumphant return to the stage and handling the pressures of fame. This is the first music video that she has filmed since an accident in November left her with over 40 stitches to her face and a broken wrist.
 
 The clip features many close-ups of Underwood's face as she cries.
 
 "I apologise if you don't like what you see," Underwood sings in the emotional tune, adding: "But sometimes my emotions get the best of me/ And falling apart is as human as it gets/ You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is."
 
 Underwood debuted the song on   11 before singing it live for the first time during an emotional performance at an awards ceremony on April 15.
