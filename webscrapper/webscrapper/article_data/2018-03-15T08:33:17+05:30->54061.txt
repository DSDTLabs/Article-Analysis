 CHANDIGARH: The vehicle-free initiative of the Chandigarh administration entered its second week on Wednesday with officials claiming a slight rise in the number of employees who cycled to office. The civic body plans to provide bicycles on rent to its staff in the near future. 
 
 Of the 800 staff members, around 100, including women led by Commissioner  , chief engineer   and mayor   took out a cycle rally in Sector 17 to engender awareness about the green mode of transport.
 
 MC commissioner Jatinder Yadav said, “We are in the second week of our campaign and I can see a rise in the number of employees reaching office on bicycles. This will keep getting better. We are getting good feedback from employees. In future, we will provide   on rent to employees to come to office under the smart city scheme,” said Yadav.
 
 Chandigarh mayor Davesh Moudgil said, “I am very confident after seeing employees on bicycles. I hope city residents cycle to work once a week. I urge citizens to use public transport more often.”
 
 This time also, a few employees were dropped some distance away from the office, from where they walked to work. A few employees also came in their personal vehicles, which they parked near the office while family members dropped a few within walking distance. 
 
 A few employees also used public transport. More women turned up to work on cycles as compared to men.
