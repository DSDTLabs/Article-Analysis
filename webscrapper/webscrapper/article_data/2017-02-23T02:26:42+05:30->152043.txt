NEW DELHI: With civic elections only two months away, deputy chief minister   on Wednesday approved a loan of Rs 200 crore to the cash-strapped   solely for payment of salaries and pensions. The civic body had asked for financial assistance from the government to clear salaries and pensions till the month of March.

 A senior government official said, “Several meetings were held in January with the corporation and instead of going in to the details of their expenditure, it was decided to release a loan of Rs 200 crore for payment of salaries. A similar loan amount was sanctioned for   earlier this month.”
 
 But the   is not happy. Senior leaders claim though the loan amount will help clearing the salaries, but in the long run it is not going to help corporations fight the on-going fund crunch.
 
 “The Delhi government should release our dues under the third finance commission and implement fourth finance commission instead of giving loans. This is only adding burden on the civic body as we will have to pay back the loan amount with interest and our dues are not being cleared,” said Pravesh Wahi, standing committee chairman of the north civic body.
