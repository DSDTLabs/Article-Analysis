NEW DELHI: Despite the initial troubles with GST, Delhi has recorded a robust   of Rs 26,337 crore as the last fiscal closed. The amount, which includes both   and   collections, exceeded the target of Rs 26,000 crore set by the  . 

 Trade and taxes department officials say the figure also includes Rs 157 crore received as compensation from the Centre for four months as stipulated under the GST regime. The GST framework says states would be compensated for the months they fail to meet the target of 14% cumulative growth. 
 
 The target for the current fiscal is Rs 29,000 crore. And officials say there would be greater focus on ensuring compliance by registered dealers to file returns. “The transition to GST has happened, and now as the system stabilises, it will be important to step-up scrutiny of the returns being filed. Compliance is the key to better tax collections,” a senior official said, adding that there are no plans for any crackdown.
 
 There are now 6.5 lakh traders on the GST network. It’s hoped that the e-way bills framework that kicked in from April 1 would help in bolstering tax collections. The e-way bill is necessary for movement of goods valued over Rs 50,000. It stops tax evasion and ensures that the transported goods meet GST norms. 
 
 TOI had reported in February that while the monthly average tax collection had gone up since the transition to GST, the growth rate was lower than expected. Among many reasons, this was also because tax checks had taken a back seat due to the tax department focusing on helping traders move to the new system. 
 
 As things have now stabilised, it’s hoped collections would improve.
