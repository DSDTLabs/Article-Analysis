JAISALMER: Royals have lost their rule, princely states don’t exist anymore but the traditions of   times are still intact.

 The princely state traditions once again came alive when former ruler   Bhati passed away and on Tuesday his elder son Kunwar   was made the family head and coronation was held with all rituals and customs, declaring him the ‘king’.
 
 In a grand function organised at Jaisal Castle on Fort, Kunwar Dushyant Singh was throned and announced as king. Jaisalmer Maharawal Brajraj Singh carried out the rituals and ending the grief of Mahendra Singh’ death, Maharaja Vikram Singh adorned him with saffron turban.
 
 On this occasion, Maharawal Brajraj Singh, Maharaja Vikram Singh Nachana, UIT chairmen   and Jitendra Singh, Prince Chaitanya Singh and other royal family members of Jaisalmer were present.
 
 Local people witnessed royal traditions a long time after the Independence. 
 
 Maharaja Dushyant Singh was brought under traditional umbrella from his house to Dari Khana.
 
 Maharaja said he will try to do his best to fulfil on responsibilities entrusted to him by the public. He thanked all for being a part of the programme.
