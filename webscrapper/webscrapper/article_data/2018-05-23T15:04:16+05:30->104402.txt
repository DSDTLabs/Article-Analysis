Vadodara: An engineer from Surat was arrested by Harni police after a cartridge was found from his luggage at Vadodara airport during screening on Sunday.

 
 A police sub-inspector of central industrial security force (CISF) found the cartridge from the luggage of the accused   during its screening through x-ray machine.   was questioned by   personnel about the source of the cartridge and why he was carrying it in his luggage. When they did not get a satisfactory reply from Mahapankar, CISF officials informed Harni police station and registered a case against him.
 
 The local police registered a case of Arms Act against Mahapankar and arrested him. During interrogation, the accused told the police that he had found this cartridge in scrap. Police said that Mahapankar earlier lived in Thane and when he shifted to Surat, he started dealing into scrap. Mahapankar also admitted to the police that he wanted to make a talisman from the cartridge.
 
 While packing his luggage, he did not realize that the cartridge was already in the bag, he told the cops. According to police, Mahapankar, who works in a private company, was going to Amritsar with his wife and a colleague. But since he did not get train tickets, he booked flight tickets to New Delhi from Vadodara, the police said.
 
 A police official said that they have sent the cartridge to FSL to get more details.
