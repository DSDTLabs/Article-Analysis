DUMKA:   MP   has advised the state government to identify illegal   and follow Assam government's move to ensure communal peace in a few pockets which are frequently disturbed. 

 Dubey, who was in Dumka on Saturday, was referring to the recent incident of stone-pelting on police in Pakur by an organisation called   during a protest against lynching.
 
 "Pakur has turned out to be one of the most vulnerable districts in the state. This is so because illegal Bangladeshi migrants have dominated the place situated near the international border," Dubey said.
 
 Dubey added that the formation of Pakur, a separate district where the minorities form a dominant position, was a big mistake.
 
 Around half a dozen police personnel were injured in the stone pelting incident when they attempted to stop a rally of the Popular Front of India organised without administrative permission on July 6. 
 
 "Formation of separate administrative units - as in the case of East Punjab and West Punjab and further in the case of East and West Bengal - on the basis of the dominance of minorities, have always proved costly for national integration. The case in the point is the creation of Pakistan which further led to the creation of  ," 
 
 "Separate administrative units at district and sub-divisional levels should not be created as minorities can emerge as a dominating force," Dubey said, adding that he opposed the proposal for formation of Madhupur sub-division (Deoghar) as separate district even if it goes against the aspirations of a section of the BJP leadership because it was a minority dominated pocket.
