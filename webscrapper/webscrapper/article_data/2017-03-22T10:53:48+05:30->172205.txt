Kanika Maheshwari, who is best known for her bubbly character Meenakshi bahu from the popular Rajasthan-based TV show  , is busy shooting for the sequel  .
 
  But this time, she has an added responsibility ­ to teach Marwari to the new actors on board! Not that she is fluent in the language herself ­ Kanika was born in Aligarh and brought up in Delhi. But after playing a Rajasthani woman on TV for almost five years, Kanika says she feels like she belongs to the state.
  
  
 
  
  In the city recently to promote the show , Kanika says, “Although I'm Marwari, it has never been my spoken language. I was brought up in Delhi and have spoken in Hindi all my life. But after working for almost five years in the show, I picked up Marwari language pretty well. In fact, the makers especially requested me to help the new actors in getting the diction right. As per the makers, I have become a master in the language! So in between the shots or during rehearsals, I help other actors ­ especially Rhea Sharma, Mayank arora and Kabeer Kumar ­ in getting a particular dialogue right. I have been helping them with the pronunciation as well. It's not easy to get the dialect right.“
