Ghaziabad: Completely cut off from the media cacophony in the   case, Madhu (22) is mourning her husband’s tragic death with her three-year-old daughter Soumya, at her in-law’s house in Farrukhabad. She’s the wife of auto driver Sanjiv, who was among the four killed when a speeding Audi hit his auto last week.

 “My daughter is asking for her father. I don’t know what to say to her,” said Madhu, between sobs. “The other day, she started crying asking for her father, and only stopped when we asked her uncle Sudish to talk to her on the phone, posing as her father,” the seven-months-pregnant Madhu added. With another child due, the couple were planning to celebrate Soumya’s third birthday on March 11 with some fanfare, but destiny willed otherwise, sending the family into eternal mourning. 
 
 Unlike Madhu, Sanjiv’s cousin Sudish, who lives nearby in Khoda Colony is enraged. “We want justice, but what we’re getting to know through media is that attempts are being made to protect the guilty, and I have no qualms in saying the police is a party to it,” said Sudish. “The credentials of the driver, who owned up to the crime, are in question. Yet, cops are parroting their stock line: “investigation is in progress”. You tell me, what inference am I to draw from the developments that have taken place since the accident?” he asks, angrily.
 
 Talking to TOI from Kanpur, Narender Singh, uncle of cousins Vishal Singh (25) and Yajuvender Singh (40), both of whom were killed in the accident, said, “Had there been no media pressure, the guilty would have gone scot free. Vishal’s parents Mahender Singh and Sandhya are inconsolable. They are yet to come to terms with the tragedy.” He added, “Just a fortnight ago, they were busy making preparation for Vishal’s wedding. Now they are left grieving.”
