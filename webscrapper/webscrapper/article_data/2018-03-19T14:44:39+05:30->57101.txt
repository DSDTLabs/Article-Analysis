NEW DELHI: In a significant development in the   case, the Supreme Court on Monday admitted the plea filed by the widow of domestic help   challenging Rajesh and Nupur Talwarâ€™s acquittal by the Allahabad high court on October 12 last year.

 
 The high court had freed the Talwars on the ground that they could not be held guilty on the basis of the evidence on record.
 
 Hemraj's widow had in December last year approached the top court against the Allahabad high court verdict.
 
 On November 26, 2013, a CBI court in Ghaziabad sentenced the Talwars to life imprisonment in connection with the case.
 
 Before the high court's order on their acquittal, Rajesh and   were serving life sentences in Ghaziabad's Dasna jail.
 
 Fourteen-year-old Aarushi was found dead inside her room at the Talwars' Noida residence with her throat slit in May 2008. The needle of suspicion had initially pointed towards 45-year-old Hemraj, who had gone missing, but his body was recovered from the terrace of the house two days later.
 
 With the Uttar Pradesh Police drawing flak over a shoddy probe into the case which was making national headlines, the case was handed over to the CBI on a recommendation by the then UP chief minister Mayawati.
