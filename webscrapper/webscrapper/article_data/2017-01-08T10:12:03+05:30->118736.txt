BENGALURU: Kannadigas residing overseas will soon get government-issued Non-Resident Kannadiga (NRK) ID cards which can be used as proof of identity, akin to Aadhaar cards.

 After unveiling the new   on Friday, industries minister   announced that the government plans to issue ID cards to roughly about 4 lakh NRKs and   (PIOs) under the new policy . â€œIt will be given as a keepsake and matter of pride to create a strong and lasting bond with their motherland,'' he added.
 
 However, the minister did not make it known whether the NRK cards would have any benefits attached, as in Kerala for overseas  . The policy will grant special concessions for NRIs when they invest over Rs 250 crore in the state.
