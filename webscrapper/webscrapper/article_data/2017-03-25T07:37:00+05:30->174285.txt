KOLKATA: Overweight constables waddling clumsily with a stick in hand might be a funny sight, but   is not amused. The   can't be allowed to take their weight problem lightly, observed the court on Friday.

 Hearing a PIL, filed recently that questioned the `mental and physical fitness' of policemen, acting   and   observed that since they are entrusted with the important job of maintaining law and order, the state government should ensure our peacekeepers shed their flab.
 
 “Just look around and you will find so many policemen with big tum mies in the high court. Don't take the matter so lightly. This matter is so serious,“ said Justice Mhatre.
 
 Earlier, the court had asked the commissioner of Kolkata Police, DG and the chief secretary to file separate affidavits on steps being taken to improve policemen's fitness.
 
 Only the commissioner filed the affidavit, prompting the court to ask the other two to file theirs within the next two weeks. They have been asked to mention whether rules have been framed to assess fitness.
 
 In his affidavit, the CP mentioned that every policeman was made to undergo a health check-up once a year and that they have been brought under a health insurance scheme.
 
 Regular training and assessment stints were held to check their shooting skills as well. But these were too little, the court felt.
 
 “These measures are not enough.Your affidavits should mention if specific rules have been framed to evaluate the fitness levels of policemen,“ said Justice Mhatre.
