The recent fire at an outlet in  , which claimed five lives, has caused a lot of concern for safety in restaurants in Bengaluru. But the Bengaluru Bruhat Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is not going to react in a hasty fashion. The commissioner,  , spoke to us, saying that the   is going to react to this situation in a patient and orderly manner. We quizzed him about some of the rumours that were floating around yesterday and he answered them patiently. 

 “This is a fire incident and we are going to take into account what is recommended by the fire department. We will implement whatever changes or suggestions they give us. There is currently no reaction or release being issued from us,” says Manjunatha.
 
 Reacting to rumours that cafés and bars serving hookah will be asked to shut as they pose a fire threat, he says, “No such decision is being taken as of now by us.”
 As for the matter of notices issued to terrace cafés and lounges across the city earlier this month, he adds, “Those were for a different reason. Most of them were operating on terraces without proper permits. We are issued notices, asking the establishments to get their together and acquire relevant permissions.”
