NEW DELHI: In the midst of reports that Chinese troops had occupied parts of north  , the government reiterated Thursday that there was no change at the 2017 Sino-Indian face-off site in the region. 

  "Our attention has been drawn to some reports that question the accuracy of the position stated by the government in respect to the situation in Doklam. It may be recalled that last year, a face-off situation that had arisen in the Doklam region, was resolved following diplomatic discussions between India and China, based on which both sides arrived at an understanding for the disengagement of their border personnel at the face-off site," said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar. 
 
  "Subsequently, in response to repeated questions about any change in the status quo at the face-off site, the government stated that there was no basis for such imputations. Government would once again reiterate that the status quo at the face-off site has not been altered. Any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate and mischievous," he added. 
 
 However, unlike its reaction to similar stories in October, MEA restricted itself to saying face-off site and not face-off site and its vicinity.
 
  "On October 7, MEA said "no new developments at the face-off site and its vicinity." But MEA's latest statement drops the words "and its vicinity," given that satellite images indicate China has built military structures even close to the face-off site since the Aug. 28 disengagement," tweeted strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney. 
 
  Kumar's remarks come in the wake of media reports about China carrying out some infrastructure development in the disputed region . Indian and Chinese troops had been locked in a stand-off for over two months last year in the Doklam area before "disengaging" on August 28.
