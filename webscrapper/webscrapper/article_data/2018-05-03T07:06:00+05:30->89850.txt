Ludhiana: After cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and MLA Sanjay Talwar raised their voices against the decision of local bodies minister Navjot Sidhu for not allotting work to a contractor in case of  , now even Congress councillors are going to put an agenda in the upcoming MC general house meeting regarding the same. The councillors claimed that when the e-tendering process was being adopted by the department, then there was no reason to reject a contractor and float tenders again, as it delayed important development works.

 Fear of departmental action for handing over development works in case of single tenders is still haunting officials. Local bodies minister Navjot Sidhu had suspended two superintending engineers of the Building and Road department for allotting works on single tenders. It is after this that officials are not allotting work to any contractor, if this criteria is not fulfilled.
 
 For maintenance of swimming pool, MC officials received a single tender. Even for the biometric attendance system, which they wanted to get installed for Class IV employees, especially sweepers, to keep a check on their regular attendance, a single contractor came forward. Now, they will have to float the tenders again. However, in the coming days, tenders for chlorination of tubewells and other maintenance works would be floated, and in case they received a single applicant, they would have to repeat the process again, causing inconvenience to the public.
 
 A senior Congress councillor Dr Jai Parkash said they had talked about the issue with mayor Balkar Sandhu, and they would put up the matter in the MC house, so that they could send a resolution to the government. He said some works were of an urgent nature and required immediate action, but even at that time, officers refused to get it done, because there was a single bidder in the e-tenders. He said when there was tendering through an online system, then there was no requirement of delaying the services.
 
 Meanwhile, MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh did not speak much on the issue, but said single tenders had halted many development works, because they were not allowed to hand over the work to that contractor.
 
 FEAR IS THE KEY
 
 * Fear of departmental action is haunting officials, as Local Bodies minister Navjot Sidhu had suspended two engineers of MC.
 
 * MC officials received single tenders for maintenance of swimming pool as well as for biometric attendance.
 
 * In the coming days, tenders for chlorination of tubewells and other maintenance works would be floated.
 
 * Some works are of an urgent nature and require immediate action, but even here the bar on single contractors is hampering these works.
