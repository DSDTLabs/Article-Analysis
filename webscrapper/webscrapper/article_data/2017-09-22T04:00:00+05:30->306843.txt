 One-and-a-half months ago, Dhoraji police station officials had found the body of Rajanikant Manwar hanging from the ceiling of a room at Royal Girls’ School on Jetpur Road in Dhoraji. Police ascertained the victim’s identity on the basis of the cellphone found on him. 
 
 There was also a suicide note left by Manwar in which he had accused Vaju Patel, Dhiru Koradiya and Pradeep Koradiya of harassing him for recovery of the loan he had taken from them. 
 
 “On the basis of the suicide note and the complaint filed by the victim’s wife Varsha Manwar, we have booked the trio for abetment to suicide under sections 306, 504 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code and launched a manhunt for them,” said an official from Dhoraji police station.
