LUDHIANA: The world of a Raikot-based couple (  and  ) came crashing down when both their sons died together in 2010. Their elder son of 21 years got electrocuted, and in a bid to save him, the second son — just a year younger than him — was also caught in the jaws of death. To fill the gap created in their lives by the cruel hand of destiny, the couple went to many doctors and religious places, but to no avail. Finally, after a gap of eight years, their wish has been fulfilled, with twin girls being born to them at a local hospital after they opted for IVF (in-vitro fertilization).

 Sukhwinder conceived the twin girls in the very first cycle. “We both feel like our children have returned to our lives. We had lost all hope of having kids again in our life, as we had been trying every kind of treatment anybody would recommend to us, but all in vain,” they said with tears in their eyes. The duo thanked the doctor and staff of the private hospital for making their dreams come true.
 
 Speaking to TOI about the case, IVF specialist Dr   — who successfully handled the case — said: “It was a very challenging case, considering the age of the couple and the fact that the woman was post-menopausal. Even the maintenance of twin pregnancy in this patient at this age was difficult, because she developed pregnancy- induced hypertension, and was on bed rest for about a month. Due to meticulous care, she was able to complete eight months of pregnancy, and gave birth to twin females — with birth weights of 2.3kg and 1.6kg. These kind of cases give you satisfaction as an IVF specialist, that by the grace of god, you can bring happiness back in someone’s life.”
