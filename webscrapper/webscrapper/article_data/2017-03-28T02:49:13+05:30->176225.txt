NEW DELHI:   stepped up its campaign for the upcoming civic elections with a “Dilli ki baat, Dil Ke saath” interaction at Bharat Nagar on Monday with the public.   president  , as part of the “chaat pe charcha” programme, heard the problems of the people and assured that   would not make any excuses but instead find solutions to the problems troubling the corporations, after it comes to power.

 Maken had earlier held a live interaction with over 8,000 Facebook followers on March 24, taking over 2,000 questions in the hour-long session.
 
 Addressing the gathering in Bharat Nagar on Monday, Maken said that Congress did not believe in making charges and counter charges, but would do concrete work to take the corporations’ functioning to the highest level. He further said the party would regularise the ad-hoc safai karamcharis and clear their arrears to the tune of Rs 1,563 crores.
 
 “In the history of Delhi, it was for the first time that 407 innocent people died due to dengue last year. The Prime Minister of the country, Shri Narendra Modi started the Swatch Bharat Abhiyan from Delhi and he also stays in Delhi, but under his nose sanitation workers of Delhi had to go on strike five times to get their salaries,” Maken said, adding that only Congress VP   raised his voice in support of the sanitation workers. “The sanitation workforce protects people from diseases and the Congress party is committed to protect their interest and help them do their duty with dignity.”
