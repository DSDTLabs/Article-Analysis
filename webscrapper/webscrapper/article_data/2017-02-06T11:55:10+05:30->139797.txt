VISAKHAPATNAM: Even as   drew to a close on Sunday evening, the much-awaited helitourism project that was announced last January is yet to take wings in the port city. According to sources, the helitourism project is awaiting nod from the ministry of civil aviation to be taken up under the regional connectivity scheme. 

 Sources said while the helipad has already been constructed at the  , the helicopter service taking tourists from Vizag to Araku will only be able to take off once the civil aviation ministry gives its approvals.
 
 Vuda sources said  , which had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for beginning the service, had already submitted its applications to the ministry. “There are some technical queries related to the project and under the regional connectivity scheme. As soon as those are cleared, the service should take off,” a Vuda official said.
 
 “The state government has been stating that helitourism will be starting in the city from Dasara. But, already three months are over and still there is no trace of helitourism in the city. The Visakha Utsav would have been a good time to launch the service as a lot of people will be coming from neighbouring areas to the city,” observed a city hotelier. He said, “Even though the government is stating that they want to turn Vizag into an international destination, projects which can attract tourists are yet to start.”
 
 At the same time, the Seaplane services from Vijayawada are also expected to take only after the floating jetties are completed. While the floating jetty has been completed in Vijayawada, sources said the tourism department is likely to take up the next work for the floating jetty either in Kakinada or Bheemili.
