NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court asked the managing director and   of real estate giant   on Monday to be personally present before it on May 5 to explain how the company intended to deal with the grievances of flat buyers who had invested in its various projects but were neither handed over their homes nor were getting their money refunded.

 A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and A M Khanwilkar passed the order after the company failed to submit a comprehensive proposal to comply with various orders of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which had directed the company to refund money to the investors.
 
 The apex court had on February 27 granted the company one monthâ€™s time to frame proposal for addressing the grievances of the consumers who had approached the court to get possession of their flats. 
 
 Advocate M L Lahoty, appearing for some of the investors, alleged that the company was not serious in complying with the order as it had failed to come out with any proposal. He said there were more than 13,000 buyers in its 41 projects but all the projects were delayed and investors were suffering. He said the buyers had lost faith in the company and the new proposal was only a ploy to delay the proceedings.
 
 After a brief hearing, the apex court directed the top officials of the company to   before it and made it clear that it would not entertain any application for exemption of their appearance. The court directed the company to come up with a comprehensive plan to address the problem faced by the investors. Officials of the company were not available for comment despite repeated attempts.
