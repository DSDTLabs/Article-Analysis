NEW DELHI: Weeks before putting in his papers as Delhi lieutenant governor,   had referred to   seven alleged instances of corruption in Delhi government. The agency was asked to probe these after the Shunglu  , formed to examine 400 files related to the Delhi government, found anomalies in some of the decisions taken by the AAP government. 

 The agency has already registered two FIRs in two cases – one involving Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan as Delhi Waqf Board chairman and another related to appointment of OSD (Nikunj Aggarwal) of Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.
 
 The agency has also registered a preliminary enquiry in connection with the opening of the feedback unit under the directorate of vigilance without necessary approvals from the Lt Governor. Sources said about 20 people were employed in the division.
 
 The other four issues are being scrutinized by CBI, but officials refused to divulge the details citing confidentiality clause.
 
 Jung had formed a three-member committee, chaired by former Comptroller and Auditor General V K Shunglu, on August 30, 2016, whose other members were ex-chief election commissioner N Gopalaswami and ex-chief vigilance commissioner Pradeep Kumar.
 
 The Committee’s mandate was to examine “irregularities” and “infirmities” in over 400 files on decisions taken by the AAP government.
 
 Its tenure was to end on December 2. It had submitted its report to the LG on November 27.
 
 In August last year, the Delhi High Court had ordered that the Lt Governor was the administrator of the national capital rejecting several pleas challenging the LG's authority after which he had ordered examining of the files.
 
 CBI has already conducted raids on Nikunj Aggarwal and seized many documents. It has been found that his appointment as OSD of Jain was cleared against rules. Similarly, Amantullah Khan had been misusing funds of DWB for personal gains, CBI has alleged.
