When it comes to criticism, there are some artistes who won't take it lying down. These celebs’ rebuttals on social media have often made headlines. But Marathi actor   is one of the few who chose to handle the situation differently.

 Recently, a follower criticized Abhijeet on Twitter, citing that the plot of his daily serial   had become so boring that his mother had stopped watching the show. Keeping it plain and simple. Abhijeet replied to the tweet, ‘Plz convey my love to ur mom.’
 
 
  
  
 On the other hand the serial is being remade in   and will be broadcast on the Kannada channel next month.
