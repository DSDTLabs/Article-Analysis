THRISSUR: The vigilance court here on Saturday ordered a probe into the allegations of anomalies regarding the transfer of land for D   owned by actor Dileep.

  The order was issued by Thrissur vigilance inquiry commissioner and special judge A Haris on a petition filed by social activist P D  . Thrissur Vigilance DSP has been told to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations and submit a report before September 13. 
 
  According to the complaint by Joseph, D Cinemaas was constructed by encroaching on 83 cents of government land and 35 cents of 'puramboke' land. He also presented the report of the Land Revenue Commissioner that came out in 2015 at the court. “What I demand is to reclaim the government land and demolish the theatre complex,” said Joseph.
 
  In the petition, he has complained against former Thrissur district collector M S Jaya. He had also sought a probe into the allegations of financial dealings between the deceased actor   and Dileep.
