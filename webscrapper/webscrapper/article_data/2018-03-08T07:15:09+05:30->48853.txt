  announced to raise the matter before the privileges committee of assembly and hold a protest outside the deputy commissioner's office on Thursday. On the other hand,   said he would raise the issue before the Punjab assembly speaker.
 
 MLA Sandhwan and his followers also raised slogans against the ADC in his office while Hingonia was leaving in a huff. The AAP MLA said, "As the DC was not available, I approached the ADC who did not prefer to rise from his chair to receive the memorandum and we had heated exchanges."
 
 He alleged that the ADC did not know how to deal with public representatives. "I had to remind him that I am part of the government as like the chief minister. Now I will raise the matter before privileges committee of the assembly and will write to   academy at   to provide the IAS officer further training so that he may know how to deal with public representatives," Sandhwan said.
 
 ADC Hingonia said, "The MLA started misbehaving with me and only then I asked him to leave. He threatened me. I will write to the speaker of the state assembly about it."
