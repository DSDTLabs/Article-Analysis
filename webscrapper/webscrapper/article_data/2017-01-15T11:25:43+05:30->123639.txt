PANAJI: Goa RSS prant sanghachalak,   on Saturday said the hint given by Union minister for road transport and highway,   to bring back defence minister,   as the chief minister will be a disadvantage for the BJP in the February 4 assembly elections.

 Speaking to reporters, Velingkar said that Parrikar’s re-entry to state politics would be a disadvantage for BJP as his image has already taken a beating.
 
 Velingkar said that going by Gadkari’s statement, it appears that BJP does not have a capable candidate for chief minister’s post.
 
 He also said that the BJP is in damage control mode as it is facing a huge challenge from the Goa Suraksha Manch, Maharastrawadi Gomantak Party and Shiv Sena alliance. “If BJP is thinking that there would be a change in the situation if Parrikar comes back, then they are wrong,” he added. Gadkari made this statement out of frustration, he said.
 
 Gadkari had hinted on Thursday that Parrikar could be the next CM, if party MLAs decide so after the polls. “A leader in Delhi could be made the CM of Goa if the party MLAs decide,” Gadkari had stated in a press conference.
 
 Asked about Gadkari’s comment, Parrikar had said, “I will cross the bridge when I get there.’’
 
 BJP has not announced its chief ministerial candidate for assembly elections and decided to fight it under the leadership of Parsekar, Parrikar, Shripad Naik and BJP state unit chief, Vinay Tendulkar.
 
 Parrikar is the key campaigner for the BJP in the state where Congress is leading an alliance of regional outfits. MGP backed by the former RSS leader besides AAP are the other players in the fray.
