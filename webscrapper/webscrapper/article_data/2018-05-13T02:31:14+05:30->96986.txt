  : A 28-year-old teacher called up police control room on Saturday afternoon to report that as many as seven persons, who had landed at her residence in Nehru Nagar III, were 'anti-social elements', only to realise later that they were employees of a private company hired by   to conduct door-to-door survey for better house tax collection. 

 The police, who received the call, detained all the youths at   police station and released them only after a GMC official came there and stated that they were indeed employees of a private firm deputed as surveyors to conduct physical inspection of houses. 
 
 The teacher, Nishu Garg, mistook them as "anti-social elements" out to harass her. 
 
 Abhishek Garg, Nishu's brother, said: "The incident took place around 2.30pm. My sister got perturbed seeing seven persons congregating in front of our house and taking pictures of the residence. They did not give any answer when she came out of the house and enquired about the purpose. Instead, they started leaving the place on motorcycles. She subsequently sought police help." 
 
 All the men were around the age of 21 to 22 years and their behaviour was not at all right, he added. 
 
 The police immediately landed at the house and apprehended the men who claimed innocence.
 
  Later, the GMC office was called to verify their claims.
 
 Mubarak Hussain Siddiqui, an IT management and evaluation specialist at GMC said: "Following the incident, the department has directed the firm to impart training in soft-skills to surveyors who are conducting inspections in 10 wards of the city. Moreover, it has been asked not to deploy people who do not have prior experience in this sort of work." 
 
 Siddiqui said the matter has been sorted out amicably with the complainant, who finally agreed to take back the complaint.
 
 After some two hours, the seven persons were released from the police station.
