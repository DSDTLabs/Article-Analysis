 Staging a road blockade, NSUI activists shouted slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre and demanded a ban on the ABVP, the Sangh-affiliated student organization. An ABVP leader was allegedly arrested by police in Jharkhand over the incident.
 
 "Involvement of ABVP's name in the   question paper leak incident is unfortunate. We believe that the main culprits behind the leak are still at large. NSUI demands a CBI probe to unearth the truth," said president of the state unit of NSUI, Jyoti  .
 
 While demanding that the central government deliver justice to all board examinees affected by the question paper leak, the NSUI demanded resignation of the CBSE chairman for the 'negligence' practised in handling question papers. The students' body also urged the central board to allocate the highest mark obtained by a student in other papers or the average mark of other subjects if a student does not wish to appear in a re-examination.
 
 The CBSE, on the other hand, has instructed all exam centre observers to be alert against any mischievous plan of unscrupulous elements before the conclusion of the board exams.
 
 A source in the CBSE said top priority has been given to ensuring smooth conduct of the remaining papers, at a time when the board is considering reports of the central observers regarding lacunas found in the conduct of the previous papers as well.
