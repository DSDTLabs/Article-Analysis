Rajahmundry: The   of Virginia tobacco has crashed at the Thorredu tobacco auction centre near Rajahmundry. The farmers are expressing anguish due to lack of remunerative price and they are reluctant to bring tobacco bales to the auction centre. 

 Even though the auction commenced 22 days back, less than two lakh kilograms of tobacco has been sold so far. The target has been fixed to purchase 26 lakh kilograms of tobacco this year and only 1.74 lakh kilograms of tobacco has been purchased. Last year, it took 75 days for the auction of 28 lakh kilograms and farmers as well as the authorities are wondering how many more days it will take for the auction to end this year. 
 
 Auction has been done for 1,750 bales at Thorredu auction centre until now and only 1,306 bales have been purchased. However, the authorities are saying that farmers will get better price if they bring tobacco bales to the centre. 
 
 The tobacco which was purchased at Thorredu till now is valued about Rs 2.6 crore at an average of Rs 146 per kilogram against last yearâ€™s average price of Rs 169. Even though seven buying companies arrived this year, only five companies are purchasing the produce as the number of farmers approaching the auction centre has been very low this year. 
 
 The yield of tobacco has come down significantly this year too as the area of cultivation has dwindled. Even though many farmers had taken permission to cultivate tobacco this year, most of them opted for alternative crops. If the farmers are able to get good price in the coming days, the area of tobacco cultivation may increase next year. Otherwise, it may dip further.
