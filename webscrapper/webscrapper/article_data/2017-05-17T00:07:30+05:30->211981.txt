Hyderabad: Congress senior leader and former MP V Hanumantha Rao on Tuesday ridiculed the statement made by home minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy on the   incident.

 Referring to the statement that those who provoke will die, the AICC secretary wondered whether the home minister holds the portfolio to kill people. “Are you in the post to kill?” the Congress leader asked Nayani. 
 
 Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Hanumantha Rao said the Dharna Chowk incident reflected the dictatorial attitude of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. “KCR wants to crush the opposition and people’s voice and therefore resorted to such tactics. He should understand that all the political parties have found fault with the ruling TRS for its decision to relocate Dharna Chowk,” he said.
 
 The former MP also pointed out that several local residents came out and offered a helping hand to the workers of the opposition parties and claimed they were against the closure of Dharna Chowk. tnn
