Visakhapatnam:   official spokesman Jagabandhu has charged the AP and Odisha governments and police with hushing up the   of October 24 in which at least 31 Naxals were gunned down.

 In a press note released in Malkangiri in Odisha on Sunday, Jagabandhu said since it was a pre-planned elimination of unarmed Maoists, there will not be an encounter. “Instead of conducting an inquiry, the AP and Odisha governments are busy felicitating the security personnel,” he said.
 
 Jagabandhu also gave a call to the people to boycott the panchayat elections in Odisha scheduled to be held from January 11 to February 25. He said the leaders who have run away from the villages due to people’s anger are now trying to contest the elections with support from the government. Such leaders will face dire consequences if they contest the elections, the press note said. tnn
