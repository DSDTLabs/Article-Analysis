 The team spent around six hours to shoot a 10 minutes scene. While Dev roamed around the streets, utilising his break time to exlpore the city,Radhika spent most of her time inside the vanity van,parked a bit far from the shooting location. According to a source close to the unit,“Winterbottom who has already shot for Trishna in Jaipur loves the hullabaloo that is intrinsic to the city.That’s the reason why he added Jaipur in his shooting locations.” The team shot for a few scenes with bodydoubles of Dev and Radhika in Chaura Rasta on Friday and, according to the team’s shooting schedule, they left for Goa yesterday evening.
