Kolkata: The Bangladesh government has started biometric registration of   refugees to track them and prevent the humanitarian crisis from turning into a law and order situation in the country.

 Speaking to TOI, H T Imam, political adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, made it clear that while Bangladesh was open to giving refuge to Rohingyas fleeing persecution, it would not harbour Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents and had even proposed joint operations with Myanmar to foil any attempt by the terrorists from infiltrating the country. 
 
 “ARSA is a common threat to Bangladesh and Myanmar,” he said.
 
 Backing India’s stance against Rohingyas, he said: “India is taking proper steps as some Rohingya leaders have taken shelter in the country. If we learn about Rohingya militants, we will act against them.”
 
 The biometric registration at refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar began last week and is aimed at checking their movement and stopping terrorists from masquerading as refugees. The Hasina government hopes biometric registration will deter ARSA militants from infiltrating the camps. 
 
 Imam said the Bangladesh government’s sympathy for the refugees ste-ms from the fact that most of those crossing the border are women and children. There are elderly and wounded among them as well. “We are giving shelt-er to them for the time being. But we need to ensure no militants slip in with the refugees who are fleeing torture as the Bangladesh PM has zero tolerance on terrorism,” he said.
