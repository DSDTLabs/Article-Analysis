 Forest officials said that they cannot confirm the species of the dolphin before the postmortem. 
 
 According to TSA members, dolphins often come in Lucknow range from Ghagra river while chasing fishes. The Gangetic dolphins come along with rising river water which is released in canals. As canals are not their natural habitat, they are unable to turn. Only dolphins less than 2 metre long can turn in canals, said TSA members.
