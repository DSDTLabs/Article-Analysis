GUWAHATI:   over the horrific gang-rape and murder of a 21-year-old girl in   has continued to escalate. Various women's rights bodies have come down heavily on the Sarbananda Sonowal government for its failure to protect women in the state. 

 The incident occurred on Thursday morning, when the girl and a friend were returning from a Bihu cultural show. According to eye-witness accounts, miscreants physically assaulted them and separated them. "They took her away and beat up her male friend. He passed out. Next morning, locals found her body on a nearby hilltop. She was possibly strangulated," police sources said.
 
 Police have so far arrested four persons in connection to the case and launched a search to nab two others. They were identified as Farim Bey (30), Mahajan Semer (19), Joysing Kro (20) and Rupsing Phongso (19). Police have been relying on information from witnesses as the absconders are reportedly not using any electronic gadgets or mobile phone, making it difficult to track them. 
 
 Inaul Haq, SP,  , who are probing the case, told TOI, "Preliminary investigation revealed that the girl was possibly gang-raped and then murdered. The miscreants, who are from the same locality, might have killed her from fear of getting identified. The absconders have been identified and will be caught soon." The postmortem report is still awaited.
