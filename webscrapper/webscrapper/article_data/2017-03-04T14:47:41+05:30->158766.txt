PANAJI: A fire in a green area of Tolto,  , on Wednesday, has raised suspicions among the islanders, as they alleged that it might be more than just a grass fire, as speculated to be by some sources.

 The fire in a partly-agricultural and green area on the western side of Tolto island in the flood plain Mandovi river threw up clouds of smoke and alerted the islanders. But the fire and emergency services department was informed only late in the evening about it.
 
 The department personnel doused the fire and waited for some more time at the site, not far away from the   ferry point. “The cause of the fire is not known, but there is no property loss,” a department official said.
 
 But the villagers of St Estevam point out that this patch is a green area. “This has also been confirmed by the forest department in a query raised under Right to Information (RTI),” an islander said.
 
 During preparation of Regional Plan 2021, the village-level committee had suggested that the area in Tolto be earmarked as eco-sensitive zone 1. Tolto was an island but is now connected by a small bridge. “There are porcupines, crocodiles, other reptiles, birds and other biodiversity. Hence, it should be a no-development zone (NDZ) under CRZ 1,” Iver Ferreira, attorney, Jua comunidade, said.
 
 But islanders were disappointed after the town and country planning department showed it as a settlement in RP 2021.
 
 The fire, which the villagers suspect may have been systematically put for a couple of days, has burnt an area of about 2,000sqm. A project granted in principle approval by   (IPB) has been proposed in the area.
 
 Formerly, the land in the area belonged to Jua comunidade. “We are studying the matter for initiating legal action,” Ferreira said.
