HYDERABAD: While the Centre has taken up the issue of   seriously with a recent order asking states to utilise funds under the   (NHM) to create awareness on food safety, the city as well as the two Telugu states fare poorly on food safety norms. There are just 24 food inspectors to monitor various aspects of food safety including hygiene of street food in Telangana. The situation is worse in Andhra Pradesh with only 14 food inspectors. While an additional 30 might be added to the list of food inspectors in Telangana in the near future, the actual requirement may be hard to come by.

  (FSSAI) held a meeting of state health ministers recently to chart out plans to deal with the menace. It was decided that one food inspector for every mandal in rural areas whereas one food inspector for every 1000 Food Business Operators (FOB) which includes restaurants, shops, vendors and manufacturers will be the standard . Telangana’s requirement was pegged at over 400 food inspectors. However, given the acute shortage of food inspectors in most states, more focus will be on creating awareness among people about what they eat and in sellers and food operators about compliance with the norms.
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “ A request for adding 30 more food inspectors to the list is currently under process. The government approval is awaited for the same. While more inspectors might be asked for as per the norms of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, the focus will be more on raising awareness to bring in self-compliance,” said a senior official from the  .
 
 The issue of food safety was also dealt with few months back by the Hyderabad High Court . The court had directed the chief secretaries of Telangana and AP to consult experts and prepare a comprehensive plan to contain rampant food adulteration in the twin states.
