PANAJI:   received multiple tweets from irate passengers aboard the 12223/Mumbai LTT - Ernakulam AC Duronto Express alleging that they were not served food on the train that left   on Saturday night, until they paid for it.

 Ticket prices for the Duronto Express running on various routes are inclusive of breakfast, lunch and dinner charges.
 
 Passengers also filed a written complaint stating that despite repeated requests, catering staff refused to address the problem and said if passengers needed food, they would have to buy it.
 
 The railways responded to the tweets around 3am on the intervening night between Saturday and Sunday, saying they will look into the matter.
 
 But by then, passengers had already been compelled to purchase dinner paying an extra amount to catering staff on the train.
 
 Sunil Yadav, a software engineer and a regular traveller who tweeted to Prabhu, said, “The railways charge high fares on the AC train. Passengers are to be provided food free-of-cost.” 
 
 Stacy, another passenger, said, “We had to go without food until midnight. Then we bought food late at night after waiting endlessly..
 
 “We also complained to the TTE, who was sympathetic to our situation but could not help us. He said people complain about this issue every day.” 
 
 Vasudev Bai, a pharma professional, said, “I was travelling alone and had paid Rs 2,500 for a ticket which included the meal price. They had asked for our meal preferences while we booked the ticket.” Bai, who was travelling to Mangaluru, said they tried to call railway enquiry numbers 132 and 182 ,but to no avail.
 
 Narendra Patil, chief public relations officer of central railways, said, “We will look into the matter.”
