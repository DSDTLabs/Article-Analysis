SURAT :  ,  , are shuddering in fear after a Gray Langur monkey has gone berserk there.

 In just one-and-a-half-months, the monkey has attacked people 19 times, including one person who was mauled seven times. On Wednesday, after the monkey attacked another person, the forest department has started the process to cage the monkey. 
 
 So much is the fear that people of Supa check twice before coming out of their houses and alter their route if they spot a money in the streets. The langur is mostly attacking people on the road without any provocation. Bipin Mistry, a 47-year-old farmer, has been attacked monkey seven times. He was even bitten once on the back when he was going on his motorcycle. 
 
 “The first time I was attacked was early in the morning on the road tomilk collection cooperative. I was shocked and suffered minor injuries when the monkey came from behind and pushed me on road. Since then, I have been attacked seven times,” said Mistry, has been living under fear for the last several days.
 
 The monkey has been targeting the villagers mostly on the cooperative mandli road. A 65-year-old woman suffered serious injuries when she was pushed by the monkey on road with great force. 
 
 Vatsal Pandya, range forest officer of Supa range, said, “After receiving information, we have started efforts to cage the monkey. We are not sure that why the monkey is behaving in this manner. So far, it has attacked 19 times and some of the victims have been attacked multiple times.”
 
 The monkey keeps on moving between Supa and neighbouring   village in search of food. The villagers even tried offer it food in the past to stop it from attacking humans. But this also did not help.
