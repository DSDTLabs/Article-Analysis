GANDHINAGAR: The Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out that proper planning and coordination between the government of Gujarat and its   could have saved escalation of the Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation (SAUNI) project cost.

  The   states that work for the four links of the   and Goma Sujkhbhadar Lift Pipeline project (GSLPP) began without ensuring adequate water supply for the projects. The Narmada authority controls the Saurashtra, Morbi and Botad branch canals. However, the when the   approached the Narmada department to make 0.97 million acre feet of water available, SSNL declined.
 
 The water resources department again asked the Narmada authorities to increase the capacity of the Botad and Morbi branch canals. However, SSNL told it that most construction work was complete and it was not possible to increase the capacity. Hence, only 110 cubic metres per second (cusecs) was available. Despite this refusal by SSNNL, the water resources department awarded a work to a consultant to prepare a techno-economic feasibility report for the SAUNI project.
 
 The consultant prepared the DPR and estimated costs based on the availability of 0.97 MAF of water. The water resources department then started the tendering process for the project.
