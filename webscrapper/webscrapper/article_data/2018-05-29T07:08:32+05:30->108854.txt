PANAJI: Taking cognisance of several complaints, the Corporation of the City of   (CCP) has written to the Captain of Ports (CoP) asking whether permissions were granted to casino operator Golden Globe Hotels Pvt Ltd to enclose a part of the footpath near the CoP jetty.   commissioner Ajit Roy, who wrote the letter, clarified that the CCP had not issued any permission and that if the footpath had been enclosed without permission, it would remove the metal barriers.

 “We received a letter from the   asking if we had given permission for the  . The CCP has not issued any permission and so we wrote to the CoP asking if it had issued permissions,” Roy said. “If none of the government departments has issued permission, action will be taken. The encroachment will be removed.”
 
 Golden Globe Hotels, which operates an offshore casino aboard the vessel Maharaja, has occupied the revamped jetty and footpath for its ticketing counter and reception area. Due the erected barricades, pedestrians and tourists are forced to walk on the road. Huge queues are seen during the evenings, with some vehicles also being parked along the road, thus hampering traffic flow.
 
 “The sheets should be taken in and the footpath should be free so that people can walk,” city mayor Vithal Chopdekar said.
 
 Roy explained that the CoP had equal jurisdiction along the Mandovi river bank, and that if it had allowed the metal barricades to be erected, an intimation of the same should have been sent to the CCP.
 
 Captain of Ports James Braganza, when contacted by TOI, said he was yet to receive any correspondence from the CCP regarding the issue. 
 
 “The metal barricades were erected by the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation when Sanjit Rodrigues was MD. From what we have been informed, GSIDC will keep the barricades till the jetty terminal building is ready,” Braganza said, adding that no specific permission had been granted for the barricades to be erected.
