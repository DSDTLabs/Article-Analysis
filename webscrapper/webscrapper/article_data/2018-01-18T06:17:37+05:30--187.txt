MUMBAI: Eight friends, including three women, were allegedly assaulted by the staff of a lounge in   after the group asked them to change their table. The group has also alleged that cops made them sit at the   for six hours before recording their statements and lodging an FIR. 

  The incident took place on Saturday night but no action has been taken yet. On Wednesday when the victims tweeted about the matter and tagged  , cops asked them for X-ray reports to show they were assaulted. 
 
  The complainants, some of them are doctors and businessmen-said the incident took place when they cancelled their pizza order after the staff refused to change their table. They said the music volume was low in the area they were seated in and hence, wanted to change the table. "The staff assaulted us when we tried to video-record their behaviour. First, the manager, some staff and the bouncers assaulted one of us, when the others interfered, they too were beaten up. The women too were pushed around," one of the complainants told   on Wednesday. 
 
  "Towards the end of our dinner, we wanted to dance but the music volume was low in the area where we were seated. So we requested the waiter to bring our last order that had been pending since an hour and a half to the new table. He agreed but said we would have to clear the bill first. But after we paid the bill, they refused to let us move to the other side, despite the tables being empty," said the complainant. 
 
  "We called the manager who too denied us the table. So we decided to leave the place and asked him to cancel the last order. They denied this request too. So we told the manager, we will record this, to which he replied 'record it' and charged at us." When TOI called up  , the staffers said the newspaper did not the right to ask anything about the matter. The manager and three staffers have been booked.
