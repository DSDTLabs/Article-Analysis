VADODARA: In a new goof up that has surfaced at  , it has come to light that students of   will have to appear for two   of physics. 

 On Tuesday, a group of students had approached dean of Faculty of  , A C Sharma, complaining that even as one batch of second year students have already appeared for their practical exams of physics, they are being asked to appear again for the same exams. 
 
 Sources suggest that the goof up occurred despite Sharma issuing circular that the exams should be taken after March 26. 
 
 However, the circular did not reach some teachers of physics and chemistry department on time. 
 
 “As per rules, we have to complete 90 days of academic session before we conduct exams. We had already decided that the practicals should be held after the theory exams get over. But there was some miscommunication and one batch of students have already appeared for the practicals,” Sharma admitted. 
 
 He added that the faculty has decided that the practicals will be now voluntary for those students who have already appeared earlier. 
 
 “If the students think, they want to appear for the practicals again, they can do so. Those who haven’t appeared, will have to appear for the forthcoming exams,” he said.
