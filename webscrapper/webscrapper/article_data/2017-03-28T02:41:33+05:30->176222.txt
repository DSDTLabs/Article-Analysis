NEW DELHI:   may have decided to replace its entire lot of councillors with new faces to beat anti-incumbency in next month’s municipal polls, but the party has assured the sitting members that those who have done good work during their tenure would be suitably accommodated. 

 BJP’s other strategy to beat any possible anti-incumbency is to distribute tickets in accordance with demographic changes that Delhi has undergone over the last 15-20 years, particularly the decline in the pre-dominance of the Punjabi community. With more people from other states having migrated to Delhi, the representation of those linguistic and other communities has become critical to any calculation. This is being given a lot of attention as the exercise to decide on tickets is on, sources said. 
 
 Party chief   has entrusted four leaders, including two Union ministers, besides Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari with the task of working out the best strategy to win the polls, two years after AAP recorded a resounding victory in the assembly elections. 
 
 Union minister   and   along with party vice-president Shyam Jaju and Vinay Sahasrabuddhe are working on the plan. 
 
  The party is also ensuring that leaders from Delhi don’t feel left out in the run-up to the polls. It is involving the sitting councillors and city veterans in selecting new faces for the electoral battle in which AAP is being seen as the main rival.
