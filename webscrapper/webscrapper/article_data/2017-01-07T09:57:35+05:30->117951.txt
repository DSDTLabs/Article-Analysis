HYDERABAD: Even as a large section of cab drivers working with cab aggregator Ola have decided to stay off roads, city auto drivers working with the company have been making longer and more number of trips per day. 

 "Earlier, I used to get 10 or 12 bookings per day on the app. Since the strike began, I get and accept 20 or 22 bookings on the app. While auto drivers used to register with Ola to ensure that they could secure some trips in addition to the ones they get while on the road, they are now spending more time on completing the trips received through the app," said  , an auto driver working with Ola since June.
 
 Agreeing with him was  , who signed up with Ola one year ago. "While most auto drivers would earlier cancel auto bookings made on the app as soon as they spot a customer on the road, who is willing to pay the quoted fare, this is not the case anymore. People are booking autos for longer distances now and so, we are willing to accept the trips," said.
 
 While cab drivers working with Ola have been protesting against the management, auto drivers have fewer complaints. "We do not make a significant profit on trips completed through the  . It is simply a second source of income for us. We do not draw a monthly income from the company. This is why we are not affected by the management's actions, unlike cab drivers who solely depend on Ola for their monthly income," said an auto driver on condition of anonymity.
