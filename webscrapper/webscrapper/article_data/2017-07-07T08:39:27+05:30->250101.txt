CHENNAI: About three months after the legal fraternity across the nation erupted in anger and decried the Law Commission of India report recommending sweeping reforms and introduction of stringent disciplinary measures in the  , the   (BCI) has invited all lawyers associations in the country for a joint meeting in Delhi. 

 The meeting will be held in Delhi on July 8.
 
 S Prabakaran, co-chairman of BCI, said, “During the joint meeting, leaders of bar associations and office-bearers of state Bar Councils are requested to send their views and suggestions with regard to the proposed amendments to the Advocates Act, 1961. Some of the provisions in the Advocates Act are still ambiguous and there is no clarity,” he said, adding, “Hence, the BCI also feels that members of the Bar must send their views and suggestions to the Union ministry of law and justice, as well as the BCI, at the earliest.”
 
 In his separate letters to all top lawyers associations, Prabakaran referred to a letter from the Union ministry of law and justice, and said the joint meeting would deliberate upon the proposed amendment to the Advocates Act, 1961, to be recommended to the ministry, for consideration.
 
 After the joint meeting on July 8, two representatives each from state Bar councils would meet on July 9 for discussions and suggestions.
