Chennai: Commercial vehicles manufacturer Ashok Leyland missed street expectations for the third quarter (Q3) of the current financial year, reporting a 13% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in profit after taxes (PAT) to Rs. 185.88 crore. On a sequential (quarter-on-quarter) basis, PAT fell by 37%. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities estimated the company’s PAT to dip 4.6% to Rs 280.8 crore

 The company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) stood at Rs 454.28 crore, a 1.11% y-o-y improvement. EBITDA fell 15% on a q-o-q basis. Revenues increased 8.18% y-o-y to Rs. 4723.6 crore during the quarter. On a sequential basis, the company’s revenues dropped 3.8%. 
 
 Rising material costs, which jumped 30% compared to last year and 32% compared to the previous quarter weighed in on the profits of the company. The company saw a significant jump in losses incurred on account of foreign exchange fluctuations, from Rs 1.71 crore recorded in Q3 of 2015-16 to Rs 63.71 crore in Q3 of 2016-17.
 
 Vinod K. Dasari, MD and CEO, Ashok Leyland Limited, said, “Q3 has been quite challenging, for the industry, primarily due to the steep increase in material costs. Demonetisation had an impact but the Industry is recovering from it.”
 
 “Despite these challenges we have maintained healthy operating margins. Our recent introductions in the ICV segment — Guru (Truck) & Sunshine (Bus) and LCV segment — Partner (Truck) and MiTR (Bus) is expected to have a very positive impact on our volumes in the current quarter,” he said.
 
 Gopal Mahadevan, CFO, Ashok Leyland, added, “The prevailing challenges in the market notwithstanding, we continue to be focused on profitable growth. We have maintained double-digit EBIDTA despite absorbing the increased input costs. We hope to close this fiscal on a positive note.”
 
 Hinduja Foundries has turned EBITDA positive in recent months and we are hopeful of getting all necessary approvals by this year end.
