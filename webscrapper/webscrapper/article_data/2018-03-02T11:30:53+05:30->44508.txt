BHOPAL: After victory in Mungaoli and Kolaras bypolls, an enthused state   has decided to hold a ‘BJP Quit India’ protest here in the state capital on March 13. The protest is being planned under the leadership of AICC general secretary in-charge of state affairs  .

 Speaking to TOI, state Congress organisational general secretary   said, “The main protest will be outside the state assembly on March 13. Party workers will gather from all across the state. Top leaders are also expected to join the agitation.”
 
 During the protest, Congress will raise issues related to farmers’ suicides, failure of Bhavantar Bhugtan Scheme, inflation, unemployment, drinking water crisis in the rural areas, Vyapam irregularities, illegal mining, malnutrition of infants and increasing crimes against women. “All vital issues related to people’s welfare and BJP governance failure will be raised,” Dwivedi said. While the agitation will start in the state capital, Congress has plans to take the ‘Quit BJP Movement’ to the districts and blocks later this month.
