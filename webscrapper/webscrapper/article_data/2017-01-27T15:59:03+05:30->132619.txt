The recently concluded 14th edition of ‘Yamini’ — a 12-hour Indian classical   and dance extravaganza – was a spectacle to cherish. Held at the IIM Bangalore premises, the event featured artistes like Pandit Venkatesh Kumar, Ustad Shahid Pervez, Sujata Mohapatra, Sikkil Gurucharan and the Akkarai Sisters. This unique confluence of various artistes takes place on the Eve of Republic day every year.
