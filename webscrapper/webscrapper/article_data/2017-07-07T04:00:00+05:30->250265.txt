Vadodara: Medicines worth Rs 5.1 lakh were stolen from a transport godown in Dashrasth village near the city early on Wednesday. Thieves entered the godown by breaking the shutter.

 Police said that 16 boxes of medicines which were manufactured in Puducherry arrived in the godown late on June 4. 
 
 Suresh Damor, a labourer working at the godown, had closed it after keeping the boxes. Cops said that Damor was sleeping near-by when the incident took place.
 
 A police official said that apart from the stolen medicines, other goods worth more than Rs 50 lakh were also in the godown but they were not even touched by the thief. 
 
 “There is also another room in the godown where goods were stored but that also remained safe,” said the official.
 
 Police suspect that since no other goods stored in the godown except the medicine cartons were stolen, an insider might be involved in it. 
 
 Since the godown did not have any CCTV cameras, the police is relying on call detail records to crack the case.
 
 “We have asked for the call detail records of all persons from the sender to receiver and even the truck driver, once we go through the details, we will get some clarity,” the official added.
 
 The medicines were to be delivered in Waghodia.
