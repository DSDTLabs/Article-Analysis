VARANASI: In Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency, there is a strong chance of new candidates replacing the old leaders of the BJP on all eight assembly seats. Veteran MLAs Shyamdeo Roy Chaudhary alias Dada and   are not even making a bid for the party ticket.Both leaders are septuagenarians and said that in the past elections, they were always nominated without having to make any effort.

 Seven times MLA from City South Assembly seat Chaudhary he said, “Like in the past seven assembly polls, I have never asked the party high command to give me the ticket.“ MLA from   seat Jyotsna Srivastava too said the same thing.
 
 Sources in the party said BJP will have no alternative other than fielding Dada from this seat again in case a rival party decides to field a big name from the City South Assembly constituency . But if there is no competition, BJP may replace Dada with a new candidate.   `Dayalu', who was Dada's nearest rival contesting on a   ticket in 2012 Assembly election, joined BJP in 2013. He is being considered as the strongest contender for this seat.
 
 BJP is also waiting to see whether SP forms any alliance with the Congress before deciding its candidate for City North Assembly seat. BJP's Ravindra Jaiswal won this seat in 2012 by a narrow margin of about 2,200 votes.
