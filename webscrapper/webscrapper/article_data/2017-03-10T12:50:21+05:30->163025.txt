KOLHAPUR: The state government on Monday issued a   (GR) to form a separate cell to look after   of the   (MDM) scheme across the state.

 According to the GR, the state coordination officer will be the chief of the mid-day meal cell. “The duties of the 41 vacancies to be filled in the cell will be described later,” the GR added.
 
 “The coordination officer will be assisted by two deputy directors and four assistant directors of the cell. The cell will be functional from directorate of primary education in Pune office, wherein a separate room will be allotted to them,” said the GR.
 
 “The financial expenses of the 41 vacancies — to be hired for the cell — will be fulfilled by funds allotted by the Central government. Of these 41 vacancies, 24 are on contractual basis, and if in future the scheme is non-functional mode all these posts will be relived immediately,” it added.
 
 Sattappa Mohite, a city-based education activist, said there are many complaints associated with the MDM, and hopefully a separate cell will work effectively in order to lessen the burden on the schools.
 
 It should be noted that to stop the declining number of students in the state-run schools, the MDM scheme was introduced across Maharashtra in 1995. The earlier nature of the scheme was take home supplement, under which students were given 3 kg rice every month. In 2001, after the Supreme Court’s instruction, the scheme began providing cooked food.
 
 Earlier last year, in order to promote transparency in the mid-day meal scheme in the government-aided schools, the state government made keeping an online record of the ration used for the daily meals mandatory.
