ERODE: In a bid to curb the increasing practise of people making self-immolation bid at public places to draw the attention of both the authorities and the media, district collector S   on Thursday said such people would be booked under various sections of law.

 “Similarly, people instigating them to do so will be booked for abetting suicide,” he said.
 
 Pointing out that   who come to the collectorate and other government offices for submitting their grievances often make self-immolation attempt by dousing themselves with kerosene and petrol, Prabhakar said, “Though it is to draw the attention of the concerned officials and the media, chances of them sustaining burn injuries or losing lives are high due to accidental fire.”
 
 Considering this, the collector said, he has directed the police to book people involving in such acts under various sections of law, including suicide attempt case.
 
 “People making self-immolation bid will be booked under Section 133 (public nuisance) of the Code of   Procedure and Sections 309 (attempt to commit suicide), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 506 (2) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Those instigating them will be booked under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC,” the district collector further said.
