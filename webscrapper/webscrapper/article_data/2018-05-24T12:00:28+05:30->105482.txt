LUDHIANA: A day after issuing suspension orders of four officials of Ludhiana Central Jail, jail minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has revoked the suspension of a superintendent at Ludhiana Central Jail, Shamsher Singh Boparai on Wednesday. The suspension has been revoked considering the fact that the official was on leave the day two undertrial siblings escaped from jail.

 Importantly, on Tuesday, four jail officials — jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai, deputy superintendent Manjit Singh Tiwana, assistant superintendent Parwinder Singh, and head warder   — were suspended for being negligent on duty, which helped the accused escape from jail. Moreover, the inquiry report submitted by IG (Prisons) RK Arora said three out of the four had signed the rollcall of Sunday night, in which the undertrials were marked present, even as they had already escaped.
 
 On May 13, siblings   and Jasvir Singh — accused of a burglary at Andhra Bank in Rasulra branch of Khanna — had escaped from the jail. The police investigation found that they scaled the jail wall by using thick cables of CCTV cameras and wall clips fixed on the administrative block.
 
 ADGP-Prison IPS Sahota said: “The day two undertials escaped from Ludhiana jail, the superintendent was on leave. Therefore, suspending him would be injustice. I took up the matter with the jail minister, who has revoked the order today.”
 
 Further, Sahota added that Iqbal Singh, presently deployed at Kapurthala jail, had been ordered to join Ludhiana jail as a deputy superintendent. On the other side, local police had so far not been able to trace the absconding accused. ADCP-IV Rajveer Singh Boparai said: “The police have been tracing the accused. We are also in touch with Khanna cops who earlier arrested them. However, so far, the police have got no clue.”
