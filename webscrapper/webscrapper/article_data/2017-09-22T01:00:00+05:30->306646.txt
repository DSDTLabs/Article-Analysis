She may have been convincing as a seductress on her last TV show ' ', but   confesses that seduction is not an easy task. She says, “It’s not easy to seduce someone with 100 people staring at you. However, I did my homework for the role by watching a lot of movies. My inspiration was   in ' '.” 

 Not just onscreen seduction, Yashashri confesses to being bad at relationships as well. “I must confess that I am bad when it comes to relationships. Living up to someone’s expectation is not my cup of tea. I like to enjoy my freedom and live life on my own terms. I cannot be dictated or ruled over,” she says. 
 
 However, the actress says that she has had her share of relationships. “I am a hardcore romantic, but I have come to the conclusion that no man is honest enough to his girl; at least, I haven’t found one yet. I have been cheated on; there have also been guys who entered into a relationship with me when they already had a girlfriend. Such experiences crush your belief in a fairytale romance. Being there for someone all the time has never worked for me. You tend to be taken for granted,” she says. 
 
 Yashashri says that over the years, she has become averse to the idea of marriage. “While my parents want me to settle down, I don’t see the need. Also, marriage is a commitment and I am not ready for it yet. I am an independent woman and I don’t need anyone else’s name to define me. I am fine with the idea of staying single all my life.”
