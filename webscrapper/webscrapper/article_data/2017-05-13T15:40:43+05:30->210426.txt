PUNE: To cash in on the growing elevator market in India, German manufacturing company   completed its first elevator manufacturing plant at Chakan in Pune. 

 Built over 22 acres in 18 months, the plant can make about 6,000 elevators annually at the current installed capacity. The company said it can expand the capacity to manufacture 10,000 units per year.
 
 Thyssenkrupp said the cumulative investment in the plant so far is about Rs 360 crore.
 
 According to the company, it will consolidate its "small" elevator manufacturing and assembly operations in   and Delhi at the Chakan plant. Some of the employees from these centres will move there. The company has about 200 employees and the number will be increased to 350.
 
 The German   hopes to boost its share in the elevator market in the country. "The annual market for elevators (and escalators in India) is 55,000 units and our share is about 6.5% to 7%. Escalators comprise a very small portion of that - not more than 2,500 and it is project-based," said Bharat Vishnani, managing director,  .
 
 With the growth of India's  , the company sees the market demand to be 65,000 units by 2020. 
 
 It hopes to have a share of about 10,000 units by then in the Rs 8,000 crore (present value) market nationwide.
 
 The new Real Estate Regulation Act has the potential to limit new project launches, as also elongate project cycles in the housing sector. It is in this scenario that companies will have to compete to increase their market share. Earlier, the company had planned to scale the plant capacity to 10,000 units by 2019. However, Vishnani said the time limit will be difficult to predict.
 
 In the 12-month period ended September 2016, the company's turnover in India increased 4% to about Rs 3,700 crore. Its elevator business in the same period grew by about 10%,   CEO Ravi Kriplani said.
