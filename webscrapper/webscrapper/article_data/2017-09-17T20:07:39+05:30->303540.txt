KOLKATA:   face the challenge of   in their penultimate   ( ) Premier Division A clash at the club ground on Monday.

 The green and maroons take on   in the Kolkata Derby in Siliguri on September 24. And, before that Mohun Bagan can ill afford to drop points as that would immensely complicate their chances of reclaiming the local league title.
 
 Moreover, both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are on 19 points with two games left in their campaign and the latter placed above owing to superior goal difference. There lies the possibility of both teams finishing on equal number of points where goal difference would become the clinching factor. Thus, not only three points, the target of the Mohun Bagan players should be victory by a big margin.
 
 The team's coach Shankarlal Chakraborty stands guarded and is not ready to look beyond Monday's game. "I will respond to queries about East Bengal only after tomorrow's match. All we know right now is that we have two more hurdles to cross," said Chakraborty.
 
 But, there are certain aspects that Chakraborty has to address. Central defender Kingshuk Debnath is suspended while Azharuddin Mallick -the star of the win over Mohammedan Sporting - is doubtful with pain in his knee. Midfielder Shilton D'Silva has still not fully recovered. At the same time, three players - Kromah, Stephane Bayi Kamo and left-back Ricky Lallawmawma - risk missing the Derby as they are on one yellow card each.
