SURAT:   were buried after an   in   in   on Wednesday evening. 

 A team of fire-fighters from the fire and emergency department reached the spot and started the rescue operation. 
 
 Sources said labourers had just finished with the concrete slab at late evening. 
 
 Suddenly, the entire concrete slab collapsed, leaving around four labourers buried under the debris. Residents in the locality immediately reached the spot and started rescue operation, but could not get through due the heavy slab. 
 
 A resident of Adarsh Nagar society Ritesh Patel said, “I heard a loud noise of the collapse. When we reached at the site, which is few meters away, we found people shouting from beneath the slab. We could do nothing as the concrete structure was heavy. Luckily, other labourers were waiting outside for their contractor to arrive and pay them their daily wages.”
 
 A fireman at the spot said, “The concrete structure is very heavy and needs to be cut. We are trying everything possible to rescue the people buried inside. The worst thing is that we are unable to hear any noise from beneath the debris.”
 
 He added, “We gathered information from the co-workers standing out that there are four labourers who are missing.” 
 
 Fire sources said the operation is likely to continue in the night.
