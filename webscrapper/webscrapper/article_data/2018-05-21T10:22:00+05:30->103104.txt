JODHPUR: Displeased with the formation of a committee by the state government in pursuance of the demand of the advocates of Udaipur to set up a circuit bench of Rajasthan High Court there, the advocates of the principal seat at Jodhpur have announced a one-day boycott of work on Monday . They are up in arms against the step of the government.

 Two associations of the advocates in Jodhpur, the Rajasthan High Court Advocates’ Association and the Rajasthan High Court Lawyers’ Association have jointly passed a resolution to boycott the work in the court on Monday.
 
 “None of the advocates from any of the two associations would be appearing in the court on Monday,” said the president of the lawyers’ association Kuldeep Mathur citing the joint statement.
 
 Mathur further added that a memorandum would be submitted to the divisional commissioner of Jodhpur addressed to the President of India Ram Nath Kovind, prime minister   and the chief minister Vasundhara Raje demanding an immediate dissolution of the committee.
 
 “After the submission of the memorandum, we would decide our further course of action to protest the demand of new circuit bench at Udiapur,” said the president of the other association, Ranjeet Joshi.
 
 It may be recalled that acceding to the demand of the advocates of Udaipur for a circuit bench, the state government on Saturday had constituted a committee under the chairmanship of law minister  .
 
 A joint delegation of advocates also met the Union law minister P P Choudhary and minister of state for Agriculture and farmers’ welfare   and protested the demand of circuit bench at Udaipur.
 
 Joshi said that a circuit bench of the high court was opened in Jaipur about 40 years back and the advocates of Jodhpur have been opposing this decision since then by boycotting the courts on the last day of every month.
