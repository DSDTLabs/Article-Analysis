Nagpur: CBSE Std XII Commerce stream students met union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday morning seeking his help to cancel proposed re-examination of economics paper. Gadkari, while assuring them to do the needful, hinted that things may not go in the students’ favour.  According to students, Gadkari advised them to “expect the best and prepare for the worst.”  Akshat Handa, a student of Centre Point School said, “We were expecting some immediate or quick solution to our problem. We have other exams as well so it is virtually impossible for us to go to Delhi or put in more time and effort to follow this up." Mansi Kedia from Delhi Public School, Kamptee Road, opined, “It’s hard time for all CBSE and we blame the board for its irresponsible behaviour and also the people who were involved with paper leak.” Another student Drishti Joshi said, “We need media’s support so that we could raise or voices and make the people in power aware of the problems we all are facing being in a democratic nation. Those involved with the CBSE should resign from their positions.” Another student Ritik Gurbani said, “We are not satisfied the way this issue is being handled and we are running out of time. CBSE should have taken certain measures to take care of this.” Nishtha Sibal, a student from Centre Point School, said, “We appreciate that Gadkari tried to help us out of this mess. The next step would be to mail the HRD minister about our views and problems caused by the re-exam. Because of few unethical people, there are many who have to suffer.”
