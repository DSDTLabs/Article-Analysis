Chandigarh: Senior Congress leader and media in-charge of All India Congress Committee Randeep Singh Surjewala on Saturday said GST in its current structure was against national interest and would prove fatal for small businessmen. Addressing the ‘Vyapar Bachao, Dukaandar Bachao, Kheti Bachao Sammelan’ in the grain market of Assandh in Karnal district, Surjewala said the BJP government had failed the people of Haryana and the country.

 “People are so annoyed and angry with the BJP that they are desperately waiting to oust BJP from power,” he said. Flanked by former MLAs and Haryana Congress leaders, Surjewala also launched ‘Haq Maango Abhiyan,’ the protest meeting jointly organized by Haryana Krishak Samaj and Haryana Kisan Khet Mazdoor Congress.
 
 “The present GST system has been brought to serve the interests of multi-national companies (MNC). Common traders are a harried lot as they do not keep the army of accountants on the pattern of MNCs. Common people are also facing same problem as the government has implemented the GST in a hurried manner,” said the Kaithal MLA.
 
 Surjewala said the GST proposed by the previous UPA government was entirely different than the current tax regime. He said UPA’s GST was simple and pro-people in which maximum tax slab was of 18% whereas the current GST of the BJP-led NDA government was complicated and anti-people. 
 
 He said various services and items like hospitals, schools, colleges, clothes, footwear, houses, food, old vehicles and rental income have attracted higher taxes under GST. Surjewala said, “Compared to 2014, the international prices of di-ammonia phosphate (DAP), potassium and urea had come down by almost 50%. So, the market price of urea, DAP and potassium should have been reduced to half but that has not happened under the NDA government. Further, 5% GST has been imposed on fertilizers; 18% on pesticides, 12% on tractors and farm equipment and 28% on tractor tyres and engines.”
