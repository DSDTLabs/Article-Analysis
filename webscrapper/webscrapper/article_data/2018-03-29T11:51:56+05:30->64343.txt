BENGALURU: In a departure from convention, AICC president   will release the state Congress election manifesto in April. KPCC president G Parameshwara said the party’s national president is not known to release state manifestos. Karnataka will be the first, if Rahul releases it, indicating the importance the high command is attaching to the state.

 The KPCC manifesto committee headed by senior MP M Veerappa Moliy met on Wednesday to discuss programmes and assurances to be included in the manifesto. “We’ll announce programmes which are in sync with the party’s ‘Nava Karnataka’ slogan. The manifesto will take final shape in the next couple of days. In the last elections, we made 165 assurances and this time the number will be higher. Congress president Rahul Gandhi will release the manifesto,” Moily said. Meanwhile, with over a score of leaders seeking tickets for their kith and kin, the state Congress unit on Wednesday decided to leave the decision to the high command. At a meeting of district in-charge ministers and district Congress presidents, it was decided to leave the decision to the high command. Senior ministers Kagodu Thimmappa, Ramalinga Reddy, T B Jayachandra, A Manju, R Roshan Baig, senior party leader Margaret Alva and others have been trying for tickets for their sons and daughters.
 
 “The high command will decide about giving tickets to children of MLAs. We recommended considering winnability,” Jayachandra told reporters.
 
 Animal husbandry minister A Manju denied reports his son is trying for a ticket. “I’ll contest from Arakalagudu. I still have age on my side,” he added.
