 scarcity has always been a hot topic in our country and students of St Joseph’s College recently found a unique way to address and create awareness about the issue. Last week, members of the Wildlife Awareness and   Club (WACC) interacted with locals in Kothanur and worked with them on water conservation. “Incidentally, we had the meeting on water conservation inside a well, which is supposed to be filled with water, but is running dry” says Kiran Jeevan, PRO, SJC and Staff Coordinator of WACC.

 Members of the club interacted with locals, encouraging them to use millets, instead of genetically-modified crops, as it conserves water and were also taught ways in which they could do their bit towards water conservation. “Small things like turning the tap off while brushing teeth or washing utensils can go a long way towards the cause. Every year, the club focuses on one endangered species and throughout the year, we conduct events creating awareness about the same. This year, however, our focus is on water shortage and conservation,” adds Kiran.
 
 Speaking about the club — which is the only one in the state by a college — Kiran says, “We also organize a national-level photography competition every year. We have a campus calendar that features wildlife pictures clicked by students every month.”
