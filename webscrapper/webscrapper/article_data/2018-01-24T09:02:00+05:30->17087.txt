CHANDRAPUR: A case of brutal physical punishment given to KG II student has come to fore in   in Chandrapur.

 Although school administration has terminated the woman teacher involved in physical torture, police have registered offence against her following the complaint filed by the girl’s parents. 
 
 Five-year-old girl   (name changed) was brutally thrashed by her teacher in her class for not writing down something written on the board. The teacher,  , not only thrashed the girl, but also brutally shook her holding her hair, so much so that a bunch of hair got uprooted from her head. The matter came to light on Monday when Kiran’s mother took her daughter for bathing. She discovered that Kiran had severe pain in her scalp and had bunch of hair missing. 
 
 Kiran’s parents rushed to school and took the principal Sister   and teacher   to task. They insisted on seeing the CCTV footage of the classroom, which revealed the brutality of the class teacher. Many other girls in the class too were similarly thrashed.   claimed that they had immediately terminated the teacher from the school and had apologized to the parents, assuring them that no such thing will happen in future. 
 
 Parents of the victim girl, however, filed complaint with Ram Nagar police against the teacher on Tuesday.
