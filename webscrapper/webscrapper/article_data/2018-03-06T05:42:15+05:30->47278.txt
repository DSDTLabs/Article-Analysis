Actor  , who loves DJing, says at some point, he would like to make music.

 "I do DJing and I love DJing but at some point, I do want to make music. But I guess I'm a bit shy and nervous. I think that's a very British thing and we just don't do that, it will happen but it's just a case of when," Elba told dailystar.co.uk.
 
 He said he also helped pick the music for his new crime film 'Yardie'.
 
 Elba added: "I was involved in the music for that, not making it, but involved in it and that was great!"
