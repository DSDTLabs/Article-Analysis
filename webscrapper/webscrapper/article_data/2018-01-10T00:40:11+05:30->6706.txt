Tirupur: A 27-year-old alcohol addict kept the city police and the fire and rescue service on their toes for more than five hours after he climbed up a high-voltage electrical transmission tower at Amma Nagar on Tuesday.

 The man, a resident of Amman Nagar near Neruperichal, threatened to hang himself from the 120ft tower and tied a rope around his neck, police sources said. “He hails from Kollegal in Karnataka and had migrated to the dollar city a few years ago. He was a labourer and was recently working in a lathe workshop in the same locality. After his wife deserted him a few weeks after their marriage, he was living alone. Recently, his relatives had found an alliance for him, but as it was getting delayed, he was depressed,” a police officer said.
 
 The man was addicted to alcohol and used to start his day with it, a relative said.
 
 On Monday, he went on a drinking binge at a Tasmac shop in Amma Nagar and had a quarrel with the staff. “He then climbed up the transmission tower behind the shop around 5am. He refused to heed to the calls of his relatives and friends to get down. A fireman climbed up the tower and had a talk with the man. It took him hours to convince the man to climb down,” said Tirupur North Fire and Rescue Services Station officer K Sakthivel.
 
 The man was provided counselling before being set free.
