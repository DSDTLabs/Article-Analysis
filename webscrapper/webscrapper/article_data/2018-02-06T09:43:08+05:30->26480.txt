 Commissioner of municipal administration G Prakash has initiated a departmental probe into the corruption, allegedly committed by contractor  , a resident of Kuniyamuthur. Sources said that the probe was ordered only after the contractor fell out of favour with a local politician.
 
 Managing and running the company named P Senthil and Co, Raja had received several contracts for road laying, drainage construction and other civic amenities in the last three years worth Rs 80-100cr. “He was so influential that city corporation engineers used to approach him to get transfers to other wards and zones,” said a senior contractor working with the city corporation.
 
 While the irregularities were taking place for several years, corporation officials maintained that there were no audit oppositions raised against the contractor. They also said that the majority of the contracts that he received were for works to be carried out in the south zone of the corporation, which falls under the constituency of the rural and municipal administration minister, SP Velumani.
 
 All the contracts in the south zone went to Raja and as per official records, more than 200 works were allotted to the company P Senthil and Co. “For every project they carried out, they paid commissions to various officials, which resulted in low quality work. We even stopped bidding for corporation projects,” alleged a corporation contractor.
 
 Another source in the know-how said, “Though the corruption had been rampant for all these years, no probe was ordered. Only because he fell out of favour of a senior politician in the region, the issue has been raised. Several files from the engineering wing and the accounts department have been sent to the CMA office in Chennai. A vigilance enquiry will also be carried out.”
