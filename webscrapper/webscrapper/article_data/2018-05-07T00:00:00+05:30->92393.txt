Trolls be damned; the serial is fetching TRPs and that’s all that matters are director Ramji’s thoughts. A few months ago, his popular serial   saw the leading lady being pushed to her death from which she narrowly escapes, only to have a near fatal encounter with a tiger before she is rescued. While the episode was at the receiving end of trolls,   was thrilled with the response — “as long as the show grabs eyeballs, I’m successful,” he said at the time. Now the director is back to repeating his magic formula — kidnapping scenes and sylvan thrills.   is back in the forest, following another kidnapping episode by a villain and this time, she’s attacked by a cheetah. “If we film such sequences within four walls, there isn’t much scope for experimentation which is why we base it in a forest as we get to bring wild animals into the screenplay. It keeps audience hooked to their seats. As for trolls, I don’t care because they’re not even my audience,” says a nonchalant Ramji. 
Meanwhile, after her Bigg Boss stint,   seems to have become a busy bee. After signing a mega serial in which she plays a princess, the actor has now made a surprise entry into hit serial Radha Ramana. Ashita plays Raman’s sister   who has been long lost and is back into the family’s fold after 20 years. Phew! Anyway, all’s well that ends well, we’ll say. 
 
  
 Then there’s the story of the much-ambitious daily soap Manasa Sarovara which is a continuation of the Puttanna Kanagal classic. It continues with the life of Santosh and   with their two children Sunnidhi and Sharadhi. Sunnidhi is a psychiatrist who works at the same hospital where Dr Anand — who has gone insane after losing Vasanthi — is also being treated. 
 Sunnidhi starts treating Dr Anand and is determined to bring him back to normal. Will Sunnidhi find out that her mother is responsible for Dr Anand’s present condition? Interesting twist of story this is! 50 episodes already, too.
