AYODHYA: As the country waits for Supreme Court’s verdict on charges to be be framed against senior BJP leaders like  ,   and   in the Babri masjid demolition case on May 30, Ayodhya’s residents claim the leaders were innocent and they were being wrongly charged. 

 Some key eye witnesses to the 1992 demolition said these people opposed the demolition even as karsewaks climbed up the mosque to demolish it. The saint communities here have decided to write a letter to the PM and appeal to the court to take back the charges against these politicians. 
 
 Kuldeep Gupta, a trader, said, “LK Advani is being unfairly dragged in this matter. I saw him shouting at the karsewaks who were moving towards the mosque on December 6, 1992. Even Uma Bharti kept requesting the karsewaks to go back but nobody was willing to listen.”
 
 Mahant Nar Singh Das of Lashkari Temple said, “They were asked to pick just a handful of sand and drop it at Ramjanambhoomi as a gesture to re-emphasize their desire to build a temple there. However, they were so driven by that time that they decided to demolish the mosque and nobody could stop them. The charges will be proved wrong.”
 
 Mahant Suresh Das of Digambar Akhara recalls, “At that time, none of the leaders was aware about any such action. When Advani resisted the move, karsewaks started shouting, “We have not come here to drop a handful of sand at the site, we will now do the actual karsewa!”
 
 A key witness of CBI in the case, Vivek Achari told TOI that he was a teenager then and didn’t know what was happening. “I was sitting on a stone plaque when I saw karsewaks screaming Jai Shri Ram and heading towards the site. We had gone to hear leaders’ speeches. MM Joshi almost fainted at the podium after seeing such outrage. That he was shocked proves he didn’t know about any such plans,” he said.
