BENGALURU: Seeking to recover Rs 100 crore fine imposed by a trial court on   in an illegal wealth case, the   on Tuesday approached the   for a review of its February 14 verdict by which it abated the proceedings against the former   chief minister due to her death.

 “In the case of appeal against conviction, it is settled law that the appeal does not abate if the accused has been sentenced to pay fine either along with imprisonment or otherwise. This principle is equally applicable to the present case where the trial court has imposed a Rs 100-crore fine, along with imprisonment,“ the petition said.
 
 The Karnataka government said the apex court's finding that the criminal appeal filed by special leave pe tition under Article 136 of the Constitu tion has abated is “er roneous“ as there is no provision either in the Constitution or the Supreme Court Rules 2013 pertaining to the issue. Even though the question of Jayalalitaa undergoing further imprisonment does not arise, the sentence to pay fine is legally sustainable which has to be recovered, it said.
