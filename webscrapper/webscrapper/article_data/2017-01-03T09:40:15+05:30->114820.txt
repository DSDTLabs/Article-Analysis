NEW DELHI: Taking cognisance of increasing

  are reported to have faced at least some form of violence, estimates by the   shows. Following complaints from the medical fraternity, the government had set up 
  in 2015 to examine such issues and evaluate ways to ensure safety of those who save lives. 
 
 In its recommendations, the panel has suggested the health ministry initiate the process to bring a central act on the issue. The proposed law may have stringent provisions like making any act of violence against a doctor, medical professional or hospital authority a non-bailable offence, a source said. 
 
 Around 18 states across the country already have such laws in place. However, in the absence of efficient implementation doctors are often left to face the wrath of unhappy kin of a patient. The committee has asked the health ministry to frame the central act in line with existing laws in different states. 
 
 A nationwide study conducted by IMA earlier showed doctors face maximum violence when providing emergency services, with as many as 48.8% of such incidents reported from intensive care units (ICUs) or after a patient had undergone surgery. The main reason behind such violence is unnecessary investigations or delay in attending to a patient. 
 
 Violence against hospital authorities are often triggered from request of advance payments or withholding a deceased body until settlement of final billing. Data shows escorts of patients committed 68.33% of the violence. The proposed law may also put more responsibilities on the hospital authorities to ensure safety and security of doctors and paramedical staff.
