HUBBALLI: The   (a little drum) was once an integral part of several festivals, including Holi. However, increasing prices of the leather halage has seen people opting for the cheaper fiber variant of the drum. 

 Business has been brisk for those selling these   on the pavement. Most residents of Hubballi are opting for these fiber drums for the Holi celebrations, from March 12 to 16. 
 
 Manjunath Hegde, a resident of Vidya Nagar, said that he used the leather halage during Holi festivities for many years. "But these drums are not easily available now. Even if we do get them, they are very expensive. Now, I use the fiber drums, which is also user-friendly," he added.
 
 Basavaraj Jakkannavar, a resident of Lingraj Nagar, pointed out that the fiber drums were available in different sizes, which was not the case with the leather halage. Durgappa Harijan said that he quit making leather halages four years ago. "I used to sell 60 drums during Holi. After people started opting for fiber drums, I was forced to stop," he added.
 
 He also said that it was difficult to get his hands on good leather. "Also, leather is very expensive," he said.
 
 Naresh Moonglikar, who sells fiber drums near the Sangolli Rayanna Circle, offers a wide range. "I sold over 400 drums this year. The smaller drums are in huge demand this year," he said.
