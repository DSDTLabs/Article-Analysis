Chandigarh: With the Congress citing “financial mess” it inherited all through its first year in power, all eyes will be on its second budget to be presented by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal in state assembly on Saturday. Last year, Rs 1.18 lakh-crore budget was preceded by announcement of the farm debt waiver scheme by chief minister Amarinder Singh.

 Unpaid liability of welfare schemes, dearness allowance and power subsidy added to the fiscal woes of the state government. While farmers are expecting more allocation than the previous year’s Rs 1,500 crore for the loan relief, Manpreet has already promised to lay special emphasis on key areas of health and education.
 
 Opposition parties are already taking pot shots at the state government demanding that it should honour its promise of complete loan waiver of Rs 90,000 crore covering loans taken from cooperative and nationalized banks as well as private money lenders. However, the government has given loan waiver of Rs 167 crore only in its first year. It will be a test for the government with its salary and pensions bills rising consistently.
 
 The white paper brought out by the Congress government last year had revised the figure to outstanding debt at Rs 1.87 lakh crore. Fulfilling its commitments under the social welfare schemes will be another uphill task for Manpreet. Last year, an allocation of Rs 1,314 crore was made for social security pension, which was increased from Rs 500 to Rs 750. “There has been no disbursal by the state government under various welfare schemes, be it the ‘Shagun’ scheme or the post-matric scholarships,” said Akali MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu.
 
 Even though the Congress government had made an allocation of Rs 10 crore for free smartphones to the youth to encourage them to “use digital technology in day-to-day life”, the scheme is yet to be rolled out.
 
 During the course of the budget session, many legislators, including AAP MLA from Maur Jagdev Singh Zira, have sought higher allocation for heath so that recruitment of missing doctors in government hospitals could be made on priority.
 
 For the education sector, last year the state government had made an allocation of Rs 30 crore for free books to general category students of Classes IX and X and all students of Classes XI and XII. The last budget had also made an allocation of Rs 1,500 crore for development of infrastructure in rural areas.
