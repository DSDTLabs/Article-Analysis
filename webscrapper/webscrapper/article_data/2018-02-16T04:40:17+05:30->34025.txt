NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has cleared the way for the income tax (I-T) department to examine if profits made by a Delhi-based hospitality firm linked to   from land deals in   and Rajasthan escaped assessment. A bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and   refused to quash a notice issued to Sky Light Hospitality by the I-T department and asked it to join proceedings from February 19. 

 The firm had challenged the notice and order passed by the I-T department mainly on the ground that it was addressed to its earlier avatar,  , even though the firm was now alimited liability company. “There was no doubt and debate that the notice was meant for the petitioner and no one else. Legal error and mistake was made in addressing the notice. Noticeably, the appellant (Sky Light) having received the said notice had filed without prejudice reply/letter dated 11.04.2017. They had objected to the notice being issued in the name of the company, which had ceased to exist,” the bench said. 
 
 “The reading of the said letter indicates that they... were aware that the notice was for them... The fact that the notice was addressed to M/s Sky Light Hospitality Pvt Ltd, a company which had been dissolved, was an error... on the part of the respondent. No prejudice was caused,” it observed. 
 
 The HC also considered the tax evasion report filed by the department that red-flagged a 2008 land deal where Sky Light purchased agricultural land and converted it to non-agricultural use before selling it to private developer DLF. I-T authorities said “quick business profits” raked in by the deal escaped assessment earlier.
