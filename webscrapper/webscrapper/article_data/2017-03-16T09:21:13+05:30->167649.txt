CHENNAI: The ruling   announced on Wednesday their candidates for the crucial  , a day before filing of nomination were to begin. While the ruling camp fielded its party   and Sasikala's nephew,  , DMK chose a low-rung functionary, R K Nagar east division secretary  . 

 The nomination of Ganesh, 42, a practising lawyer, was announced a few minutes after the   decided to field Dinakaran. While the choice of Dinakaran is a bold gamble for AIADMK, DMK's decision reflects a new strategy to take on its rival and capitalise on a possible anti-Sasikala sentiment. 
 
 AIADMK party presidium chairman and school education minister K A Sengottaiyan announced that Dinakaran was an unanimous choice of the Parliamentary board led by V K Sasikala, serving a prison term in Bengaluru. 
 
 Dinakaran said he was proud to contest in the bypoll so that he could continue the welfare measures initiated by Jayalalithaa and the schemes she planned for R K Nagar. 
 
 On the prospects of winning the constituency against the backdrop of a split in AIADMK, Dinakaran said the party saw only DMK as its rival and not any individuals or group, referring to former chief minister O Pannerselvam and Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa Jayakumar. "MGR founded the party only to prevent Karunanidhi's DMK, the evil force, from gaining power. Amma followed his mentor and we will continue," he said.
