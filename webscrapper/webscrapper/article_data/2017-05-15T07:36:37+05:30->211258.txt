PUNE: The process of selecting members to the civic body’s   appears to be stuck in a jumble of muddled  . A prerequisite for the selection process is tied to a department that no longer exists in the state, bringing the entire process to a standstill for the moment.

 “Last month, the civic body placed an advert inviting applications for seven Tree Authority posts to be filled by subject experts from NGOs. It mentions that the organisation must be registered with the  . However, this department no longer exists,” explained activist   of city-based organisation Vruksham.
 
 Since April 1, the social forestry department has been integrated into the forest department. “The state government hasn’t announced an official gazette on the norms and regulations of the department as yet. In that case, how can an advertisement posted on April 20 require an NGO to be registered with it?” Jain questioned.
 
 Now, PMC has written to the department to clarify its powers in the process. “A letter from the   was sent to the secretary of revenue and forests, seeking to clarify the matter. Until we get a reply on the same, the selection of NGOs has been halted,” said a tree officer of the civic body.
