Sixty dancers from India qualified recently for the Dance World Cup, to be held in Spain later this year. The qualifiers, held for the first time in India, saw several dancers battle it out for a spot in the competition. Held in Bengaluru, the qualifiers saw participants from different parts of the country like Mumbai, Chennai, Pune Kolkata and more. Of the 60 participants, 36 dancers from Bengaluru will represent the country at the dance competition. Lourd Vijay, who helped organize the qualifiers in the city, says, “It is indeed a proud moment for us as 60 of them have qualified for the   finals. This is the first time that a qualifier was held in India. We have won medals in the past but the qualifier was never held in the country before.”

 Lourd says that now the focus will be on getting all things into place like accommodation, logistics and more. “We are looking for sponsors for the   and we need to make arrangements for their accommodation as well. In addition to this, our focus will be on getting the kids to train extensively,” says Lourd, adding, “Since the participants are from different parts of the country, we have to find ways to coordinate with them.” “We want to tap into the talent specially in the 2-tier cities as there is a pool of talent there,” Lourd sums up.
