Mumbai: Learning its lesson from last monsoon, the   has decided to   that have  , instead of doing a patch work by fixing the craters on by one. The civic body is focussing on 110 road stretches that altogether had 430 potholes last year, and is working to fix them by May 15.

 At his monthly meeting with ward officers on Saturday, civic chief   reviewed work on these chronic road patches and directed the officials to complete the remaining work on a priority. An officials said the civic chief is trying to minimize pothole-related problems this monsoon.
 
 To start with, civic engineers were earlier asked to identify spots that have several potholes. They identified these 110 road patches. Officials said these spots were found to have a large number of pothole during every monsoons for several years. Subsequently, the civic authority decided to repair the entire spot after resurfacing the road stretches, instead of repairing every pothole. Of these 110 patches, twelve are in the eastern side of Andheri-Jogeshwari belt, 11 in Kandivali (West) and 10 in Ghatkopar (West). Civic officials claimed that they had already repaired 80 % of the spots patches and remaining 20% work would be completed by May 15.
 
 Filmmaker and activist Ashoke Pandit said, “Entire city witnesses potholes during monsoon, so on what basis is BMC saying there are just 110 stretches? We see a huge number of potholes in our Juhu circle area every monsoon, as in the Western Express highway. The civic body should focus on all pothole patches instead of a few select ones.”
 
 Officials said they are hopeful of its success after their similar experiment with desilting work in drains last year. After the flooding in the city in July 2015, the civic chief had put desilting work on his officials’ priority list with several checks and balances. They claimed that it showed its result, and there were fewer cases of waterlogging in the city during 2016 monsoon.
