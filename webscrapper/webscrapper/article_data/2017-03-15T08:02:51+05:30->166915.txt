BENGALURU: For  , who comes from a small town in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, where internet didn't quite exist in abundance until recently, bagging admission for the one year Master of Law (LLM) programme at   is more than a dream comes true. A final year student at   versity (NLSIU), Bengaluru, the 22-year-old is one among the 24 students from across the world who are qualified for the course.

 Aradhya wishes to pursue internet law in connection with constitutional law. “Internet didn't exist when our Constitution was created. So the Cyber law requires alot of policy additions. My focus is on how to make India better in this area. Internet helped me get more exposure,“   added. Inspired by the digital boom in India and various developmental changes linked to it, he questions the issues of net neutrality and freedom of internet access.
 
 He presented his paper on Aadhaar system in September 2016 at the Oxford Internet Institute of the University of Oxford.
 
 While getting through the   programme itself is considered a challenge, Aradhya may well be the youngest to have made the achievement this year. “The LLM course is taken up by students even after other postgraduate degrees. I was told that Yale doesn't accept students who are fresh out of law schools. I'm happy that I will be sharing space with the people who envision change, “ said Aradhya.
 
 While he had got a positive response from the University of Oxford, Aradhya is planning to go to Yale in August.
