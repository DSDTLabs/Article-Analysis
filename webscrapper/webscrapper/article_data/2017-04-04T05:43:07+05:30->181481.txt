 The first liver transplant was conducted in February with the help of experts in liver transplant from ILBS. “We have developed the facility in the hospital for liver transplant which is available in very few hospitals in northern India,” SMS Hospital’s organ transplant convenor Dr Vinay Tomar said, adding that they are taking technical help from ILBS in liver transplant.
 
 He added that the first liver transplant patient of the hospital has already been discharged. Now, 15 days after being discharged from the hospital, he came for a follow-up.
 
 “He came to the hospital for a follow-up a day ago. He is fine now,” Dr Tomar said on Monday.
 
 The first 25 liver transplants, which will be conducted with the help of ILBS doctors, will guide the SMS Hospital doctors to learn about safety and other technical details of liver transplant. This will be done to prevent any complication when they will conduct liver transplant on their own.
 
 In the first liver transplant, ILBS had sent a 15-member team of doctors and other staff expert in liver and other organ transplant headed by liver transplant expert Dr Viniyendra Pamecha.
