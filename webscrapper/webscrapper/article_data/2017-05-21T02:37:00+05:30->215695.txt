MUMBAI: Vehicular movement on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway was disrupted for nearly two hours after oil leaked from two tankers and spilled on the speed lane in the Baur Ghat section near Amrutanjan Bridge on Saturday. 

 “We have registered complaints against the   drivers with the Khopoli police station. The tankers were overloaded and oil was spilling on the road, much to the risk of the highway users. The drivers told us that the tankers were overloaded at the directions of the owners in Mumbai,” a Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) officer said.
 
 He added that police will, from now on, file complaints against drivers and owners of trucks and tankers “if they cause nuisance on the highway that triggers   snarls”.
 
 HSP officials said the two oil tankers were headed for Pune around 8am. “The tankers were full and oil started leaking through the lids. Both the tankers continued to move towards Pune for nearly 2km from Baur ghat to Amrutanjan bridgebefore some motorists stopped them,” an official said.
 
 “At least four cars that were trailing the tankers lost control and skidded on the spilt oil. Fortunately, no accident occurred,” the officer said.
 
 Expressway authorities, HSP and local agencies rushed to the spot and stopped vehicular movement towards  . Sand trucks and water tankers reached the spot and the oil was washed out.
 
  Several vehicles were stuck in long queues that extended up to 2km towards Khopoli.
