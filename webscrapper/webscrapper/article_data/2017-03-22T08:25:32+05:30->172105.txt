HYDERABAD: The   work in the city has sprung up many such 'odd' constructions across Hyderabad that have thrown traffic out of gear. With staircases and stations standing bang in the middle of the road, at some places, the carriageway of arterial stretches have shrunk drastically. 

 The scene is particularly chaotic during peak hours when commuters complain of being held up in serpentine traffic snarls for hours together. "Negotiating the Begumpet area, in particular, has become a struggle. At times it takes up to 45 minutes to one hour to just get past this stretch," said S Santoshi, a resident of Trimulgherry.
 
 Though compassionate about the concerns of residents,  , state minister for municipal administration and urban development, assures that the problem is only temporary. "Projects like   Rail, during their construction period, do create traffic snarls but people should understand that it is for the betterment of the system," he said.
