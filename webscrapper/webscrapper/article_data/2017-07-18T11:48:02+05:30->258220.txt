PUNE:   of the   ( ) conducted a raid and drew   of a   from a wholesaler in   late on Monday evening following a citizen’s complaint alleging that the rice was made of ‘plastic’.

 Senior police inspector Mohan Shinde of Market Yard police station told TOI the raid was conducted after a complaint by advocate Rafiq Shaikh.
 
 Apparently, some of Shaikh’s friends ate the rice at a Chinese food joint near Market Yard and vomited immediately, fostering suspicion about its quality. “It is a basmati rice variety that is packed and processed at Karnal in Haryana and is marketed by a Delhi-based firm,” Sanjay Shinde, assistant commissioner (food), FDA, Pune, said.
 
 “We found only one sack weighing 25kg of the suspicious rice in the godown of the wholesaler during the raid. We drew 2kg in sample from the sack for testing. We will send it to government-designated laboratory for analysis,” Shinde said.
 
 When contacted, Shaikh said, “After my friends vomited, we approached the food stall operator who took us to the retailer who supplied him with the rice. The retailer in turn took us to the wholesaler in Market Yard on Monday afternoon,” he said. 
 
 The suspicion grew when the dealer who supplied the rice to the wholesaler didn't turn up throughout the day. “Following this, we brought the issue to the notice of the Market Yard Merchant Association. A sizeable number of merchants gathered outside the wholesaler’s shop and informed the police. Police took the sack in their custody around 4pm on Monday. Later, they informed the FDA officials around 7pm,” Shaikh said.
 
 He said the wholesaler may have shifted the stock of the plastic rice stocked at his godown as the police took about six hours to involve FDA into the case.
