CHENNAI: A 37-year-old   from Thiruninravur lodged a complaint with Chennai city police commissioner   on Tuesday, saying she had received death threats from a sand mining gang which she claimed was backed by the   tahsildar.

 
 In her complaint, Thanuja Diana said she had been charting out steps to prevent the smuggling of sand from river beds by a gang on March 5 as per the instructions of the revenue divisional officer (RDO), Tiruvallur. While these steps were being implemented, the tahsildar Madan Kuppuraj had warned her not to take any measures that would hinder  , she said. 
 
 In her complaint, Diana stated that the tahsildar told her that she would be mowed down by a truck if she refused to pay heed to his warning. She also claimed that he had been verbally abusing her over phone and in person since then and asked her not to use her official vehicle anymore.
 
 Subsequently, the tahsildar called her to his office and warned her of dire consequences if she persisted with her efforts, she said. Unable to bear the torture, Diana said she fell sick and swooned after suffering chest pain. She was later admitted at a nearby private hospital from where she was asked to shift to another hospital. Since then, she had to undergo treatment at a government hospital.
 
 Diana said she was resting at her motherâ€™s house at Villivakkam on Thursday when three unidentified men barged into the house and issued death threats to her and her family. In her complaint, she said that she feared for her safety and that of her family members who are under continuous threat.
 
 She sought police protection both at work and at home and also demanded action against the tahsildar as well as the sand mining gang.
 
 Meanwhile, officials said that a departmental probe has been ordered into the incident and the tahsildar has been transferred to Ambattur.
 
 Repeated efforts to contact the tahsildar proved futile.
