 KOLKATA: Thieves struck at a   on Saturday night when its owner was asleep and his relatives were out on an invitation. They decamped with jewellery worth Rs 50,000 and cash of Rs 27,000. The house owner, a senior citizen, came to know about the theft on Sunday morning. 
 
 Aditya Mohan Bhattacharya (70) has been living at his Mahesh Dutta Lane residence for decades. While he lives in one portion of the one-storied house, the other part is occupied by his niece   and her husband Pradeep. On Saturday evening, Bula went out to attend an invitation. "I went out around 9pm and returned after 40 minutes. I did not notice anything unusual. Uncle reported the theft in the morning," said Bula.
 
 When Bhattacharya woke up in the morning, he started looking for his mobile phone in another room. Soon, he noticed that the room was ransacked. When Bhattacharya looked around, he found the door of a cupboard broken. He looked inside and didn't find the locker. He later noticed it lying at one corner of the room. "There were some jewellery and cash in the locker which Bula had asked me to keep. All of them were missing. My mobile was missing too," he said. Cops have questioned the maid. Since the house is being renovated, cops are also not ruling out the involvement of masons.
