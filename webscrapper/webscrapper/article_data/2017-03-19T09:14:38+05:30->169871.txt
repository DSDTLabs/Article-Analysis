SECUNDERABAD: Various firms including government agencies have set their eyes on acquiring a parcel of land adjacent to   (near Jubilee bus station) in  . The plot, about 1.20 acres, is now used for trade fairs, exhibitions and circus. 

 Thanks to its prime location, a number of government and private bodies are vying to take possession of the site, which is classified as class 'C' (Cantonment) land. The applicants include city traffic police, for vehicle parking. There is also a proposal to set up a star hotel. The SCB has so far received over a dozen applications.
 
 About two years ago, the SCB proposed to construct a multi-storeyed commercial complex and to allot it on rental basis to mop up its revenue. SCB authorities also planned to collaborate with L&T-Hyderabad Metro Rail. The SCB at one stage considered a proposal to convert the vacant land into a mega park on the lines of the   near Hussainsagar. However, none of the proposals have materialised.
 
 "We are receiving many requisitions. We have not yet taken any decision. We will conduct a feasibility study before allotting the land to any agency," SCB chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar told STOI. 
 
 The SCB will take the approval in the SCB Board meeting and forward the proposal to the   for final approval.
