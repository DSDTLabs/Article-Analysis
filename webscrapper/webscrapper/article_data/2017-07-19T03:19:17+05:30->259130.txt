New Delhi: For over a month, they had protested against their plight. And to drive home their message, they had adopted extreme measures. Finally, they had left. Over two months hence, these   farmers are back in  . 

 They want economic security—higher prices for their produce, writing off of their loans by nationalised banks, individual crop insurance, pension of Rs 5,000 for those above 60, and the inter-linking of rivers. 
 
 “Big corporate loans are written off, but they don’t want to help farmers. We are called the backbone of the nation before an election, but we are slaves after the election,” said P Ayyakkannu, who leads the contingent.
 
 From March 14 to April 23 this year, these   had tried to attract the Modi government’s attention with strange forms of protest: from holding skulls of those who killed themselves in distress to holding dead snakes and rats in their mouths to running naked on streets. 
 
 Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan had promised help. “We went back to Tamil Nadu believing that commitment. But even 80 days later, nothing has changed, so we have no choice but to come back,” said Shanmugam (35) 
 
 On Sunday, the farmers had gone to the PM’s residence to place their demands, but were detained by the police. “We were not given any food or water the whole day; we got food only after 5pm when two of the old men fell sick,” said Shanmugam. 
 
 The farmers also claimed that the police threatened to lock them up and make sure they never returned to Tamil Nadu.
 
 They have now threatened to consume poison if their demands aren’t met within a hundred days.
