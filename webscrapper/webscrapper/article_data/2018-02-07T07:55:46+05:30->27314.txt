NEW DELHI: Underlining that PM   had personally inked the  , Congress president   dubbed the contract with France for the fighter jets a "scam". He alleged irregularities were the reason behind the Centre's refusal to provide the agreement's details. 

 Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Rajya Sabha on Monday that details of the deal could not be made public since inter-governmental agreements were classified information.
 
  Rahul told reporters, "For the first time, the defence minister is saying that we will not share details of money spent on buying the aircraft... I spoke during the Gujarat polls that there is a scam. Modiji has personally got the deal done." 
 
 Rahul added, "Modiji had personally gone to Paris. Personally the deal was changed. Entire India knows it. And the defence minister is saying she will not inform India, Indian martyrs and their relatives about the money spent on buying those aircraft. What does this mean? This only means there is some scam."
 
 Calling it "the great Rafale mystery", Rahul tweeted that the deal was negotiated by the PM and his "reliable" buddy.
 
  
  
  In a press conference, Congress said the purchase sought to promote the financial interests of the PM's "crony capitalist friends". It accused the government of flagrant violation of defence procurement procedure and of not taking clearance of the Cabinet Committee on Security. It claimed that the new cost of each jet was said to be around three times higher than the cost finalised by the   in 2012. Congress said Eurofighter Typhoon had offered to reduce its price by 20% but was ignored. tnn
