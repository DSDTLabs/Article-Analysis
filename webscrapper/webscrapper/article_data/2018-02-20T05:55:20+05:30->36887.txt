CHENNAI: The   issued notices to the Centre on a petition filed by S  , a life   in the   assassination case and India’s longest-serving woman prisoner, challenging the legality of Section 435 (1)(a) of CrPC, due to which she is ineligible for  .

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Abdul Quddhose passed the interim order and said the notice should be issued to the attorney general of India through the high court’s additional solicitor-general of India. Since the constitutional validity of the provision is challenged, the Centre has been directed to respond by March 19.
 
 
 Section 435 (1) (a) mandates that the state government consult the Centre on the remitting or commuting a sentence in any case where the sentence is for an offence investigated by any central agency.
 
 On February 1, the Tamil   government unveiled a scheme for the premature release of life convicts who had completed at least 10 years of imprisonment. But Nalini would not be eligible for the scheme, since the offence for which she was convicted was investigated by the CBI.
 
 Assailing it, Nalini said, “When the object of premature release is reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners, and when the convicts are released only on the basis of good conduct in prison, which can be assessed only by the respective state government, the law mandating the state to consult the Centre would be irrational.”
 
 She added that once convicts are confined in prison, all of them are required to be treated equally.
