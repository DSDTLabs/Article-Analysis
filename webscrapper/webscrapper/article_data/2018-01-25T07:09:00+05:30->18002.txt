BATHINDA: The   police have registered case against leaders of contractual and regular employees of Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant (GNDTP), Bathinda and supporting organizations for disrupting traffic on the   stretch of the national highway. Hundreds of employees and their family members had on Tuesday blocked the highway for nearly three hours near the Bathinda district administrative complex ( ).

 The case has been registered at the Bathinda Civil Lines police station under sections 283 (danger or obstruction in public way), 341 (wrongful restraint), 431 (mischief by injury to public road) of the IPC and Section 8B (punishment for mischief by injury to national highway) of the National Highway Act 1956.
 
 Those who have been booked include GNDTP contractual employees coordination committee convener   Singh Dhillon, co-convener Ashwani Ghudda, Iqbal Singh,  , Varinder Singh, PSEB employees joint forum convener Gusewak Singh Sandhu, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union (PKMU) general secretary   and activists of supporting organizations Didar Singh Mudki, Apaar Singh, Amritpal Singh, Parkash Passa and 150 others.
 
 However, the contractual and regular employee unions of the GNDTP have condemned the move and termed it a ploy to browbeat them.
 
 Undeterred by the registration of the case, they continued with their round-the-clock protest outside the DAC.
 
 “We are not afraid of the cases. The state can’t make us end our protest by slapping cases. We will get stronger with these cases and renew our protest with vigour. We will continue the protest till our demand of withdrawing the decision to shut down the thermal plant and regularizing our jobs is met,” said contractual employee coordination committee convener Rajinder.
 
 Meanwhile, many contractual employees said that their children and wives had fallen ill on Tuesday due as the protest in the rain. They continued to sit at the protest site on Wednesday after being given medicines.
