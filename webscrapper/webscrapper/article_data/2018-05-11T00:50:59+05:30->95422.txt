NEW DELHI: A   national, whose visa had expired, died on Wednesday night after he was taken to the foreigners’ registration office to begin deportation procedures.   had been accosted by the police after receiving reports that he was pelting stones at the public near the Zakhira flyover in west Delhi. Going through his documents, police discovered he was staying in India illegally after the expiry of his visa in July last year.

 Around 3pm on Wednesday, police responded to complaints that a foreigner was hurling stones at the public and had grown violent when some people tried to stop him. The 44-year-old Russian had hit his head on the ground a few times during the melee.
 
 When the cops asked Erin to accompany them to the police station, he refused and allegedly started behaving violently again. Police officers said he was finally subdued and taken to  , where he was treated for injuries on his head and arms. While going through his documents, the cops discovered his stay permit was no longer valid. 
 
 The Russian   was informed and the process to deport him through the FRRO was initiated. As the formalities were being completed, however, Erin, sitting in the police vehicle, reported feeling dizzy and was taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre. There he complained of chest pain and collapsed. The doctors administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and revived Erin, but he died later at night.
 
 Jatin Narwal, DCP (North), said that a magistrate was informed about the incident immediately. “An enquiry has been initiated,” Narwal said. The cops are going through CCTV and mobile phone footage to find out whether Erin was attacked by someone because of which he had been throwing stones. Erin, a Moscow resident, had arrived in India in January last year on a tourist visa.
