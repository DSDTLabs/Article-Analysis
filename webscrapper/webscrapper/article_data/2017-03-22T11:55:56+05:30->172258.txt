BENGALURU: Can't wait to savour sweet, succulent mangoes? This year, you needn't travel all the way to   to bring them home. Stalls will be set up in 35-40 locations across the city as part of the  , likely to be organized from May 1 to 31.

 The proposal has been floated by the Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Corporation. KSMDMC chairman L Gopalakrishna said the aim is to ensure that farmers get returns for their produce. “Earlier, customers had to go to Lalbagh to buy mangoes. This year, there can shop from stalls in their neighbourhood,“ he said.
 
 “The move will also benefit the sellers as not all of them can be accommodated in Lalbagh. They can pick the spots where they want to set up shop,“ Gopalakrishna added.
 
 The corporation is host ing an interactive session with mango cultivators from Kolar, Chikkaballapura, Ramanagara and other districts on Friday (March 24) to zero in on the he locations where the mela will be organized.
 
 Alphonsos scarce?
 
 With two cyclones affecting parts of the state in 2016, the mango production has dipped to about 10 lakh metric tonnes from last year's 14 lakh metric tonnes. Due to this, Alphonsos may seem scarce as the variety makes up for only 30% of the total mango production this time, said Kadire Gowda, managing director of KSMDMC. “About 30%-40% of the to tal area (nearly 2 lakh hectares) was damaged during the cyclones, and the groves in Kolar, Ramanagara and districts in   were the worst affected,“ Gowda said.
 
 However, the corporation has increased its export quan tity this year and will be shipping upto 10,000 metric tonnes of mangoes to countries like USA, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and those part of the  . Karnataka's mangoes will aso be sold in states like Goa, Kerala, Delhi and Gujarat, added Gowda.
