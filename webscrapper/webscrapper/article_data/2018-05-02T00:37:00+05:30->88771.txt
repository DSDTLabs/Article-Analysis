Amaravati: The AP government has withdrawn the   numbers of women beneficiaries under the nutritious supportive programme of the women and child welfare (WCW) department, following a report that appeared in these columns on April 30.

 It was found that the government had provided the Aadhaar numbers of 4.8 lakh women beneficiaries, both pregnant and lactating mothers, who have been receiving nutritious food from the Anganwadi centers across the state. The women visit the Anganwadi centers every day to receive the food supplements and also for primary health check-up.
 
 When the TOI reported this violation, IT minister Nara Lokesh instructed officials of his department and the women and child welfare department to remove the Aadhaar numbers of the beneficiaries from its website. Accordingly, the department has now removed the information. 
 
 The officials claimed that the Aadhaar number is recorded for effective monitoring of the scheme and not for any other purpose. However, the IT minister has now instructed all the departments concerned to drop the Aadhaar information from the lists of its beneficiaries under various schemes.
