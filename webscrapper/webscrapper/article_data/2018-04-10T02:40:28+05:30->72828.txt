MUMBAI: He is young, literate and unemployed. That's the average profile of a convict in a Maharashtra  . Data from the state prisons department shows that 32% more convicts in the 18-21 age group were admitted to jails in 2016-17 than in 2015-16. 

 It shows that most of them were unemployed, privately employed (mostly in menial jobs, according to experts) or engaged in farm labour (implying landlessness) before incarceration. Also, most of them come from the villages and, according to experts, belong to the backward castes or minority communities. Sociologists say the evidence calls for social reform and employment generation so that those who live on the margins are better integrated into mainstream. 
 
 
  
 Over 14,000 convicts were freshly admitted into prisons each in 2015-16 and 2016-17. The number of those aged 21-30 years increased by 9%. Criminologists say that the world over, criminals are a young population and Maharashtra's figures only reinforce a trend that has for long been observed, including in other parts of India. 
 
 “Crimes are committed during the active years of one's life. One has to be energetic and athletic to pull off a crime, particularly property offences like theft and robbery. Of course, one of the reasons why the population of younger convicts is on the rise in the state could be that given the nature of their offences, their trials have finished faster,” said an IPS officer.
