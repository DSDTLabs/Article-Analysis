MUMBAI:   has decided to provide sheds adjacent to foot-over bridges (FOBs) outside seven stations to ensure a stampede-like situation does not occur during heavy rain. TOI had reported earlier how civic chief   had instructed all 24 ward officers to construct temporary shelters outside railway stations. 

 
 This follows the   tragedy on September 29, 2017, when 23 people died. Commuters had gathered on the FOB and staircase to avoid getting wet. The crowd swelled as trains kept bringing in more passengers.   chief PRO   said the 215 sq ft sheds will be set up at seven stations. Sheds at Currey Road, Thane and Kanjurmarg are ready and work will be completed at Kurla, Kalwa, Nahur and Diva by May-end.
 
 
  In case of heavy rain, commuters can take shelter in the holding area. It will ensure there is no overcrowding on staircases or FOBs. CR has begun a queue system at Parel to ensure orderly movement of passengers entering the platform. It also plans to deploy additional security staff for crowd control
