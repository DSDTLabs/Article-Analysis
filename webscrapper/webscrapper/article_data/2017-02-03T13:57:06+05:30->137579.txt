PANAJI:  , on Thursday criticized the   (ECI) for putting out a notice to him on the   before serving it to him personally.

 On Wednesday, the ECI issued a notice to Parrikar for allegedly violating the model code of conduct by telling people gathered at an election meeting that they should accept money to attend   but should vote for the BJP.
 
 Speaking to reporters, the defence minister said, “Why should the ECI put out a notice on its website? It should be served to the individual. Posting it on their website is the wrong procedure.”
 
 Claiming to have got wind of the development only after receiving several calls and messages from journalists in Delhi, Parrikar said he then called the ECI and was served the notice on Wednesday night. “I have sent the notice to my lawyer and will reply,” he added, while ruling out chances of it impacting the looming assembly election in any way.
