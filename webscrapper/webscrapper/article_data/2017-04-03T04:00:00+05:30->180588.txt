Ahmedabad: This summer vacation, children in residential societies chose to be catalysts of change with the TOI-Times Foundation  . On Sunday morning, knocking every door in their neighbourhood, these children requested donations in the form of old newspapers for poor children. They were accompanied by their parents and society association members, lending a helping hand.

 More than 250kg of old newspapers was collected in two separate drives in Vejalpur and Chandkheda. The society members invited Pasti ki Masti team for the collection. “For parents, the Pasti ki Masti drive was an opportunity to expose children to the larger picture of life, beyond their immediate surroundings,” said Yamini Godse of Swagat Bungalows in Chandkheda. “So we encouraged our young to think of helping the less fortunate people by raising funds in such a noble way.” She said that children can learn to share and care for others when such activities involve them. “We will put together one more drive in the coming weeks,” said Godse.
 
 Gopal Panigrahi, the treasurer of Sanmukh Co-operative Housing Society in Vejalpur, had mobilized residents to participate in the Pasti drive. “We had 15 children voluntarily taking part in the drive, which was heartening and it encouraged residents to carry old newspaper piles to the collection point,” he said. “We will surely collect more. We loved being part of the drive.”
