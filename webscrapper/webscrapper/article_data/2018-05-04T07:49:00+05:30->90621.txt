Chandigarh: Stating that the goods and services tax (GST) on langar served at gurdwaras has hurt Sikh sentiments worldwide, Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the urgent need to waive off GST on ‘langar’.

 Harsimrat, who met the Prime Minister on Wednesday, said Modi had assured her that the issue would be addressed appropriately. Earlier, Harsimrat had on April 26 written to the P< explaining the concept and importance of langar and community kitchen started by Guru Nanak Dev in 1481. The community kitchen was started to propagate the principle of equality in society regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status. 
 
 The Union minister has also written to the Prime Minister about the mechanism to address concerns of the revenue department against misuse of GST exemption for langar at the gurdwaras. She had explained procurement of langar items like desi ghee, milk powder, oil, sugar and gas cylinders attracted GST of up to 18%. But Harsimrat added Harmandir Sahib was running world’s largest mega kitchen that was serving free meals throughout the year to lakhs of devotees. She added that donations for the langar came from devotees’ humble offerings and the committee managing the shrine should not be burdened with GST for the noble cause.
