BENGALURU: Barring a momentary smile he flashed while occupying the chief minister’s chair on Saturday morning, B S   remained glum throughout the marathon oath-taking session.

 So disturbed was he that he announced his resignation and walked out of the Karnataka assembly hall even before the national anthem was played.
 
 It’s been a hard three days for Yeddyurappa who desperately worked to up BJP’s tally from 104 to ensure his continuance as chief minister. He’d phoned a few Congress MLAs and requested them to bail him out during the crucial floor test, but in vain.
 
 “He refused to smile at anyone, including us. He was angry and sad,” a former   minister said. In his speech, the Lingayat strongman accused JD(S) and Congress of playing “opportunistic politics” by forming a post-poll alliance against the people’s mandate, and said he would not give up. “I am a fighter. I have never sat quiet. Today, it is a trial by fire (agniparikshe) and my whole political career has been this way,” he said. “They kept saying they wouldn’t let the other come to power. But after abusing each other and losing the polls, they have joined hands.” Terming the JDS-Congress coalition a setback to democracy, Yeddyurappa said several MLAs were too scared to support his party.
 
 This isn’t the first time Yeddyurappa has been checkmated by Kumaraswamy. In 2007, when it was Yeddyurappa’s turn to become CM in the JD(S)-BJP coalition, Kumaraswamy played spoilsport and BSY was CM for seven days.
 
 If there had been a floor test, it would have been Yeddyurappa’s fifth. His first floor test was in November 2007 when he was chief minister for seven days.
 
 He quit before moving the motion. In 2008, he faced the second test as CM after winning 110 seats and getting support from independents, and proving his majority in the house.
 
 The third time was in October 2010 when a few independent legislators withdrew support but Yeddyurappa won the trust motion under controversial circumstances.
