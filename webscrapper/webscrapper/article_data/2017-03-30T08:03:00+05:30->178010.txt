LUDHIANA : With the last date for disclosing   under the income tax department’s amnesty scheme, Pardhan Mantri   (PMGKY), drawing near, the department is trying to convince people, who had made huge unaccounted cash deposits in their accounts  , to either admit the tax evasion and pay tax or face the consequences. Sources in the central board of direct taxes (CBDT) said so far close to Rs 200 crore of black money has been surrendered from the   (NWR), which includes Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, J&K and Chandigarh. Of these, Rs 97 crore were unearthed by the department’s investigation wing. 

 “In Punjab, Amritsar tops the chart in disclosures from where Rs 18 crore were surrendered in March alone,” they added. 
 
 Post-demonetization, about 250 surveys were conducted in Ludhiana by the assessment wing. Investigation into several cases is still going on. So far, one of the biggest surrenders under the scheme was of Rs 75 lakh by the owner of a department store on Gill Road on whom I-T department range 4 had conducted a survey in last week of February. 
 
 A senior officer of the I-T department’s investigation wing said, “Under the scheme, the declarant is charged 50% total tax on his black money, besides 25% of his black money is kept in a lock-in period for four years. For those who fail to declare their black money or undisclosed assets under this scheme, penalties are very strict, which include charging tax up to 107%, penalty up to 300% and prosecution ranging up to 10 years. PMGKY is a golden opportunity to escape the penalties and is available up to March 31.”
