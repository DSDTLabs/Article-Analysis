TRICHY: Farmers and functionaries of various farmers' groups expressed hope that the draft submitted by the Centre at the   will safeguard the interest of the farmers in Tamil Nadu.

 
 However,they stressed that the scheme should have complete power. Irrespective of the nomenclature, it should be adequately empowered and independent in character, they said.
 
 There was no dispute in implementing Krishna Management Board, Narmadha Management Board and   in the country. If the Cauvery scheme would be similar to those existing boards, there would not be any problems, secretary of   District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai RVimalnathan said.
 
 “If the norms followed to implement those boards are also followed in Cauvery scheme, then there won’t be any problem. Moreover, the draft had stated that the control of important reservoirs will be under the states concerned. It will be a matter of concern. Because, the neighbouring states may take the same position as now, when it comes to release of water,” he said.
 
 Monitoring the cropping pattern of respective states, the area of irrigation, and amount of water used for industrial and domestic purposes by the authority is a welcome move, said S Prakash, a farmer from   in Thanjavur.
