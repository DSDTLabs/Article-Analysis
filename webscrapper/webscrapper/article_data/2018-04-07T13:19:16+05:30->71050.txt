SECUNDERABAD: Commuters from the city suburbs were left stranded or forced to squeeze into crowded buses due to disruption of MMTS services on the   route during peak office hours on Friday morning. The railways later announced cancellation of four trains on the route.

 A technical snag with the overhead wire at   station reportedly triggered the disruption. Railway sources said that an overhead equipment block happened during the rush hours, bringing the MMTS services, which ferry around 1.6 lakh passengers daily, to a standstill for a while. It led to huge crowds at the stations. Some people alleged that auto drivers charged extra to take advantage of the fiasco.
 
 After the railways announcedthecancellation of four trains, a commotion-like situation prevailed at the Secunderabad station. “After the announcement was made, there was a sort of commotion as the foot over bridges were congested with people who were getting late to reach their destinations,” said   who was going toMalakpet.
 
 Railway officials said that MMTS services returned to normal later in theday, but miffed commuters rued that the trains were running behind schedule after restoration.
