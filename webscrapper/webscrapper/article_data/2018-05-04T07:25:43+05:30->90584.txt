KOCHI: With the special investigation team arraigning North Paravur circle inspector   as accused in the custodial death of   S R of  , more police officers are likely to face charges. 

 The special investigation team has booked the circle inspector for manipulating the documents to wrongly record the arrest in the general diary as 9.30am on April 7 even though the youth was taken into custody at 10.30pm on April 6. 
 
 Sources said that officers who were handling the general diary at the station are also likely to be arraigned as accused under the same section soon. 
 
 According to sources, more police personnel are likely to be arraigned as accused in the case under IPC Section 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment). 
 
 "Policemen at Varapuzha police station also failed to react when the accused SI G S Deepak tortured the victim past midnight on the fateful day. This would also lead to more police officers getting booked," said sources. 
 
 Sreejith was taken into custody in connection with the house attack by three personnel of the now defunct rural tiger force directly commanded by the then police superintendent A V George. The investigation team is yet to question George in this regard.
