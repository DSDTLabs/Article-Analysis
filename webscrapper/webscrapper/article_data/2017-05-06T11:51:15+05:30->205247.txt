Popularly known as the Wireless Walking Violinist,   was in town recently for a performance. And the musician was bowled over by the city and its people. Although this was his fifth visit to  , Aneesh took time out of his schedule to explore the many wonders that the city has to offer.

 “Belagavi has the right mix of South Indian and North Indian culture, so I got to eat a lot of North Indianized South Indian food, and vice versa. I am a pure vegetarian and when I was here, I was treated to a huge thali that consisted of delicacies like Aam Ras, which my fans had prepared for me. I was also gifted two full boxes of mangoes,” says Aneesh, who was touched by the warmth that he received from the people of namma Belagavi. “The people here are very different. I have been to a lot of places, but I find that Belagaviites are very unique. They are very warm and go all-out to make you feel welcomed. And this holds true with everyone, not just celebrities,” says the violinist.
 
 An architect, Aneesh also visited the many tourist spots in the city and took in the culture and history. “I visited the Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, where I was told that Swami Vivekananda stayed for a while. Since I am an architect, I observed the thick walks there made of mortar. I also visited other touristy spots, such as the   and the Fort, and was impressed with the old-world charm of the Military  . I really enjoyed my visit,” Aneesh adds.
 
 And if everything works out, he will be back in the city for a performance in a few months.
