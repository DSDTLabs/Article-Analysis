 Bengaluru: Having proved himself time and again as the dependable trouble-shooter during all political crises, the Congress high command has once again restored its confidence in energy minister D K Shiva Kumar to bail out the party's candidate for the Rajya Sabha polls Ahmed Patel by ensuring the Gujarat Congress MLAs stay together.
 
 The 55-year-old Kanakapura MLA and Vokkaliga strongman has risen through the ranks of the Karnataka Congress and has carved out a space for himself in the national party circles. This time too, despite being away in Singapore on a holiday with his family, Kumar was asked to look after the Gujarat Congress MLAs till the Rajya Sabha polls on August 8. The KPCC president G Parameshwara is in London and his camp was not aware of the developments. 
 
 AICC general secretary (Karnataka in-charge) K C Venugopal was in Bengaluru on Friday to coordinate the MLAs’ stay before flying back to Kochi on Saturday. Kumar co-ordinated with his younger brother and Bangalore Rural MP D K Suresh to ensure that all arrangements were made to receive and whisk the Gujarat legislators to Eagleton resort which is located in Suresh’s constituency and barely an hour away from Kanakapura.
 
 Suresh asked their cousin and party MLC S Ravi to manage the facilities inside the resort for the  . They roped in a businessman and a close friend of Suresh to assist in the entire operation.
 
 Over the past three years since the Congress party was wiped out in the 2014 parliamentary elections, Kumar has been increasingly given national assignments. He was given a prominent role in the Assam elections and his astuteness and man-management are much in demand.
 
 In April this year, he was put in-charge of Gundlupet assembly bypoll, which the BJP riding on the premise of Lingayat support tried to wrest from the Congress. Kumar and his political strategem resulted in the party coasting to a victory.
