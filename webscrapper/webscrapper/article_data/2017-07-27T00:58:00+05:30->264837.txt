Coimbatore: A group of medical aspirants and their parents from the city on Wednesday demanded the State government to cease its ‘drama’ on quashing the national eligibility cum entrance test ( ) by creating a ‘wrong impression’ that   students will be affected.

 Supporting the common entrance exam for medicine, the students said that by attempting to quash NEET, the Tamil Nadu government was only helping the Namakkal rank factories. 
 
 “We have looked into some numbers. The percentage of rural students landing a medical seat is less in Tamil Nadu. And, on what basis is the State government saying that the rural students have not fared well in NEET?” asked S Bragadeeswaran.
 
 Despite the Supreme Court clarifying that Tamil Nadu was exempted from Neet only for 2016, the State government was trying to get permanent exemption from the exam, they said. “We had decided to appear for NEET this year. So we brushed up the basics from the class 11 syllabus of the State board and have passed the exam with good score,” Bragadeeswaran said. 
 
 The students said that the state government, instead of creating a false impressions about the exam among rural students, should focus on improvising its syllabus and examination system. “Most of us studied the State board syllabus and were able to crack the exam. We urge the Tamil Nadu government to provide more facilities to the government school students enabling them to clear the exam in the coming years,” Bragadeeswaran further said.
