NEW DELHI: In order to check ball tampering in international cricket, former leg spinner   says players should wear trousers without pockets. According to him, a pocketless trouser will ensure that the cricketers cannot carry any object or substance for tampering the ball.

 
 "I would like to see all cricketers wearing pants without pockets. Why do you need pockets for?" Siva, a former member of  's cricket committee between 2014 to 2016, told TOI on Saturday.
 
 "Today, the umpires are quite lenient and allow drinks and other stuff as and when the players need it. Therefore, why do you need to carry anything in your pocket when you get the basic needs through the 12th or 13 th man," Siva said while reacting to recent ball tampering episode involving the Australian captain Steve Smith and his deputy   along with Cameron Bancroft.
 
 Some others say it may not work as the players can hide things in their socks or underwear. However, taking something out of a pocket is far easier than socks or elsewhere. Siva was a part of the   committee when zippers on pockets were disallowed after it was found to alter the conditions of the ball. "We stopped it during my tenure in the ICC cricket committee," Siva recalled. 
 
 But one which is surprising for Siva is that the Australian bowlers didn’t see the condition of the ball being changes or did they assume that it was normal wear and tear of the ball? “The ICC’s cricket committee will address the issue and set a fine example for the future generation of cricketers," Siva added.
