Actor Suniel Shetty’s father   passed away at 1.30 am on Wednesday, at the age of 93. Virappa breathed his last at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai. According to reports, his last rites and cremation will take place tomorrow. Virappa Shetty, a self-made hotelier, is survived by his wife, actor son Suniel and daughter Sujata.

 It has been reported that Mr Shetty had suffered a massive paralytic stroke in 2013, after which an ICU was set up at his South Mumbai residence. It is also believed that Suniel let his acting career take a back seat during these trying times to tend to his ailing father. The actor has, however, picked up the reins from his father and continued their booming hotelier business. 
 
 Suniel’s daughter Athiya is currently out of the county shooting for her upcoming romantic-comedy ‘Mubarakan’.
 
 We offer our condolences to the Shetty family.
