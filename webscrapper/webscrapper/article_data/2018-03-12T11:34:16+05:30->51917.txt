Coming off a stupendous run after Angamaly Diaries, director   won his first Kerala   for the Best Director for his yet-to-be-released movie  .

 The filmmaker, who is currently dubbing for his cameo role in  , talks to us about his win:
 
 
 I don’t know if it’s any more special than the other achievements as I give the same importance for every accolade. But after shooting this film, I guess I was comparatively more satisfied than my other movies. I think that had to do with the things around – the performances and the kind of spirit the film had.
  
 
 It is a small film and frankly, I have never felt the burden of expectations. I think it’s when you unrealistically create an expectation, that’s when you become unable to do a good movie. The idea is to always do a good film; it doesn’t matter if it is big or small.
  
 
 That’s something I have strongly believed in and it’s what I will be carrying on even in the future.
