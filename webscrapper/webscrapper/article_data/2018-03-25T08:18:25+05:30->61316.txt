MAPUSA: Senior state BJP functionary and   MLA Francis D’Souza, on Saturday said formation of the three-member   (CAC) was better than having a single person assume leadership during chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s absence. He also said talk about leadership crisis within the BJP was mere perception.

 “All the major parties have representation in the CAC. As decisions are taken collectively by three members, no one person has to take the blame. There are also no problems in decision-making.
 
 
 This is better than a single person taking charge,” D’Souza said, while he and members of the newly appointed committee for the downtown planning scheme for Mapusa interacted with reporters at his residence.
 
 The Mapusa MLA also said discussion and speculation over the CM’s health was in bad taste and uncalled for.
 
 “We have to wait for two months. The CM’s health is his personal issue. We can only say he is unwell. We don’t have to discuss what has happened to him and what kind of treatment he is taking,” D’Souza said.
 
 He also maintained that presently, there was no question of a change in leadership. “If the CM wants a change in leadership, he should say it is not possible for him to continue, and the party will take a decision,” he said. Replying to a question pertaining to candidature for a new CM, D’Souza said, “All 40 members are eligible to become CM. What is wrong with that?”
