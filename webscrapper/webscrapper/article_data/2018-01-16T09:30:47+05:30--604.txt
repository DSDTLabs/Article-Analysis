 The NIA has evinced interest in this case -- it has similarities to the ‘love jihad’ Hadiya case currently being heard by the Supreme Court – and has informed the Kerala high court that it will probe the case if the court permits. 
 
 Riyaz, 26, and his father  , natives of Parimadam near Tellicherry in Kannur district, said the charges of forced conversion and the attempt to send his wife to Syria are baseless and are ready to face any investigation in the case. 
 
 Riyaz’s wife, hailing from Ranni in Pathanamthitta district and residing at Jam Nagar in Gujarat, had sought an NIA probe alleging that her ‘husband’ Muhammed Riyaz was planning to take her to Syria. According to her petition, she was studying animation at Bengaluru in 2013 and fell in love with Muhammed Riyaz, who was staying near her hostel. In November 2015, he invited her to his room and had sexual intercourse. He recorded a video of it and then subjected her to sex again by threatening her with it. She was then taken to a training centre and forcibly converted to Islam.
