GURGAON: Crisis across five   is likely to resume as “disinterest” by the government is triggering murmurs of discontent among temporary lecturers who feel “cheated”, alleging they had “walked into a trap” by calling off their strike last month following assurances from the department of   that all their demands would be met.

 Sumer Singh, spokesperson,  , Haryana told TOI that the association was mulling resumption of strike in a fortnight’s time, if the government doesn’t announce any action in the next few days. “This time we will abandon our duties as exam invigilators. We won’t submit student’s assessment sheets to the university based on which their result will be declared,” he said. 
 
 The strike had begun on February 13 after 250 extension lecturers took to streets and refused to take classes over an issue regarding their salaries. According to the lecturers, they are underpaid and government must implement the ruling of Punjab Haryana High Court on May 5, 2016 that recommended disbursement of salaries to extension lecturers as per the   (UCG) norms. Extension lecturers form over 50 per cent of staff in government colleges in Gurgaon.
 
 On March 4, lecturers had called off their strike following assurances from the director general higher education, A Sreenivasan. The lecturers had given seven days’ time to the government to fix the issue.“We have not been paid since July last year,” highlighted Singh.
 
 Lecturers alleged that the chief minister lied in the assembly recently about resolving the issue. “The chief minister told Congress leader Kiran Choudhary that he will resolve the matter soon. Where is the resolution?” a lecturer from Sector 14, Government College said. 
 
 When TOI called A Sreenivasan for comment, he said he was out of station and would react only once he was back in town.
