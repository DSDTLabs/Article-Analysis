MADURAI: Dismissing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against an alleged encroachment, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 on the petitioner for suppressing the fact in the case and wasting the precious hours of the court.

 One N Murugan from Trichy filed a case stating the one A   encroached the tank situated in V   in Manapparai, due to which availability of ground water has been affected and thus sought a direction to the Trichy collector and   tahsildar to remove it and restore the tank.
 
 When the case had come up for hearing recently, the division bench headed by justice M   ordered the officials and the alleged encroacher to file a counter to the case and adjourned hearing on it. 
 
 On Monday, when the case came up, Pitchamuthu filed a counter before the court. He said that the said land was not a tank.
 
 “The subject matter of the property belonged to the forefathers of the petitioner (Murugan). In 1986, the petitioner sold the said piece of land to him by way of sale deed. Besides, the same man last year filed a case before the high court bench stating that it was a water body (tank) and thus seeking to cancel the patta given to me and restore the tank (the sold land) to its original position. But, the court in July last year dismissed the petition by saying that he could get remedy by approaching the appropriate forum prescribed under Patta Pass Book Act. Suppressing the whole facts, he again filed the petition in the name of public interest,” Pitchamuthu said producing necessary documents. 
 
 Following it, the bench dismissed the petition and imposed Rs 10,000 cost on Murugan.
