HYDERABAD: Stressing the need for being more cautious on social media, cyber security expert   discouraged young students from sharing too many details on these platforms. "Do not send or click any   Even if you trust your best friend, you should never send your private picture or pictures of your private moments to any one. The other person can always misuse and threaten you," said Tandon as part of a lecture on Cyber safety for women and children he delivered at the Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology on Saturday. 

 He asked students to maintain strict private settings of social media applications like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc, while educating them about the threats of cyber crime. He also insisted that students follow a two-tier security system for their social media accounts, with a one time password system. "Sometimes people get messages with a weblink. When one opens the link, it displays the same format like that of Facebook. What people don't notice are the small anomalies (like wrong spelling etc). So once they log on, hackers get the ID and password. That is why it is better to have a two-factor authentication system, which is available on social media applications like Facebook," he added. 
 
 Jyotsna Angara, National Board member of YoDee and FICCI Ladies Organisation said, "Educated and uneducated women both today use fancy gadgets, but are still unaware of cyber safety aspects. We have been conducting several workshops across the country with students, so that they can teach others including their parents about it," said Angara.
