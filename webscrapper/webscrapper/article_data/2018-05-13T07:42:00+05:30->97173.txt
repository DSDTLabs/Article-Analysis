CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   has welcomed the SAD suggestion to the Election Commission of India for deployment of paramilitary forces for the Shahkot assembly byelection on May 28. He said it would deprive the opposition parties, especially the SAD, of the chance to accuse the state government of interference.

 The CM said foreseeing its defeat, SAD was indulging in frivolous allegations against the Punjab government about the misuse of official machinery.   said it was indeed ironical that though the   had abused all democratic systems during their own regime but were now using all possible tools to prevent the   from taking over the state’s reins. He added that SAD leaders were now running to the election commission, seeking paramilitary forces for peaceful polls. The chief minister said neither he, nor his government would oppose any decision taken by the election commission to deploy paramilitary forces.
 
 Pointing out that during the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll SAD had resorted to complaints of official machinery’s misuse, Amarinder said Akalis were in the habit of complaining of government’s interference and violation of the model code of conduct in every election. Stating that the Congress win in the   was definite, the chief minister said that SAD leaders were in a state of panic and were grabbing every opportunity to sway public sentiments in their favour. But he said SAD’s tactics would fail to mislead the people.
 
 The chief minister said it was SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal who was boldly supporting Mehatpur SHO Parminder Bajwa, who has now been found by the EC to be unfit for duty. Amarinder further added that it was part of the Akali campaign to malign the Congress leadership and government ahead of the polls.
