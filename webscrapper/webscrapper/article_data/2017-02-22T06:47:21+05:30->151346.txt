NAVI MUMBAI: A seven-foot   was rescued from   bridge in the nick of time by activists and released in the wild. 

 Plant & Animals Welfare Society ( ) Mumbai team received a call on Monday from a college student, Atharva Chavan, informing them that the python was seen on the bridge, apparently trying to cross the road.
 
 “We advised Chavan to try and stop the incoming traffic so that the snake was not run over. Fortunately, he managed to guide the python towards the roadside, so that it wouldn’t be injured by any passing vehicle. It must have somehow come on to the road from the neighbouring mangroves while chasing a prey,” said Sunish Subramanian of PAWS-Mumbai.
 
 He added that when they reached the spot, Chavan told them that the snake was safe. “We informed the forest officials and released it in the forest. Python is protected species under Schedule 1 of Wildlife Protection Act,” he said.
 
 Atharva Chavan said that he was heading home when he spotted the snake in the middle of the road. “I called up PAWS-Mumbai Helpline. I am very happy that the snake was rescued,” he added.
