Rather than staying put on ' ', which is set to take a 20-year leap with a reincarnation track, actress  , who plays the antagonist in it, has decided to quit the show. Reason: The actress is in no mood to age on screen. 

 Ridhi, currently seen as a mother of two daughters, would have to play a 50-year-old once the reincarnation track is introduced. The actress confirms, “I have informed the production team of my decision and there is no bad blood. It's an amicable decision. They told me that I will have a look that won’t make me look older but I was sceptical. It’s a risk and I am not ready to age on screen. Taking up a negative role was in itself a challenge for me. I don’t mind playing an older character on stage or in a film, as that’s for a short period, but TV is a different ball game. Fiction shows run indefinitely. I don’t want to be stereotyped. I don’t want to drag myself to the set cribbing and complaining every day about my role.”
 
 So, what will happen to her co-actors   and  ? "Well they will be reincarnated and will return to take revenge on Nisha (Ridhi's character)," informs a source associated with the project.
