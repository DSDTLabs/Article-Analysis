MARGAO: The   ( ) on Tuesday demanded that the state government scrap the laptop distribution scheme to students of Class XI and XII in the current form, on the grounds that it amounts to “unfair trade practices” and “stands to destroy the IT industry in Goa” 

 Edwin Vaz of the AAP told reporters that the scheme was “a scam of Rs 85.5 crore” as the “terms and conditions of the tender are fixed in a manner that favours cartels or a select few dealers in the state”.
 
 “Considering sale of around 7,000 laptops per annum, the tender accounts for an average of almost seven years of business value. As such, computer dealerships in Goa will no longer be sustainable and most dealers will have to shut shop,” Vaz said. 
 
 Pointing out that the tender’s conditions require that the whole lot of laptops be custom-made, which only a manufacturer is in a position to do, AAP questioned the need for dealers to be awarded the tender as opposed to awarding it directly to manufacturers. 
 
 Vaz also alleged that certain conditions in the tender go against the guidelines of the   (CVC). 
 
 “One option is to award the tender directly to the manufacturer while ensuring that the manufacturer has an established and impartial distribution network in the state,” Vaz said.
 
 He further reasoned that “students would benefit if given a fixed subsidy, instead of forcing such laptops onto them. This will do away with the tendering process itself”.
