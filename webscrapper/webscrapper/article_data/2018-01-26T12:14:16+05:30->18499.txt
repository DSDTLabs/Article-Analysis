NAGPUR: Passengers of Mumbai-bound   Express had a miraculous escape on Wednesday when the train hit a nilgai between Wardha and Timtala stations under  .

 As a result, Central Railway chief public relations officer (CPRO)   said, the train reached CSTM on Thursday at 12.50pm, five hours behind the schedule time. It forced many passengers to miss their scheduled appointments.
 
 “The mishap damaged the train guard and the power car. Besides, hose pipes of three coaches were also broken. This led to speed restrictions which caused the delay. There is hardly any margin for the Duronto to recover lost time,” said Udasi.
 
 According to SG Rao, the Central Railway spokesperson in Nagpur, one of the coaches had a “damaged spring”. “Therefore the speed had to be restricted to 50 kmph,” he said.
 
 The train had left Nagpur station at its scheduled time of 8.40pm on Wednesday. Somewhere after Wardha, passengers were woken up with a loud noise. “We were told that the train had run over an animal,” said DS Gaikwad, a Sion resident who was in the train. “It didn’t move for almost an hour.”
 
 “Later, the train moved in fits and starts. As most passengers were asleep, we didn’t realized the delay. It was only at Bhusaval in the morning that we realized that the train was five hours late,” said   who, along with  , were heading to Goa for a badminton tournament beginning on Friday.
 
 “We had a flight for Goa at 1.30pm but we missed it. We had to book another flight and it cost us Rs6,000 each. It was almost double the fare that we had paid earlier,” added Arora. 
 
 Another passenger, Biswajeet Manna, who was travelling in A3 coach, said, “I had to take leave from office as I would have reached office only by 4pm from my residence in Goregaon,” he said.
