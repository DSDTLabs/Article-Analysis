It has been six years since   launched   and   in 'Student Of The Year'. Since then, while the duo has maintained that they’re great friends and share a warm equation, they haven’t had a chance to collaborate on a project. The only time they made an exception was two years ago, when they were roped in for a dance-and-music tour with their mentor, for which they travelled together to various cities in the US. 

 While news is doing the rounds that   has replaced   as the hero in '  3', we hear that the two may soon reunite. However, it’s not for a film. Apparently, the actors will be seen endorsing a product, for which they’re expected to shoot an ad film. If all goes well, the ad will be released later this year. 
 
  We reached out to the actors and their respective teams. Sidharth’s manager didn’t confirm or deny the news and texted, “We are currently not in a position to comment on this.” On the other hand, Varun and his team didn’t revert to us till we went to press.
