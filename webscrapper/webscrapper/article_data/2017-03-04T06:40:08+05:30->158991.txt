SECUNDERABAD: People who encroach on   in   will now lose voting rights in cantonment elections. Their names will be struck off the voters' list for cantonment elections. However, they will continue to remain voters for assembly and parliament polls. 

  chief executive officer   Chandra Sekhar made this announcement at the board meeting held on Friday. He referred to the orders issued by the director-general of Defence Estates, Delhi, to the Secunderabad Cantonment to implement  's judgement delivered in September 2016. 
 
 The SCB has eight civilian wards for which elections are held. The election is scheduled for 2020. The SCB is now updating its electoral rolls to identify encroachers and remove their names from the voters' list.
 
 The SCB received instructions from DGDE, Delhi, on March 1. The CEO explained about the Supreme Court's judgement to the media. He said people residing in illegal/unauthorised properties constructed on government land will be de-franchised. The board will take up a detailed survey to identify encroachments. 
 
 The SC's order is likely to affect thousands of voters in Cantonment. It will also impact the winning chances of public representatives. In the last SCB polls held in 2015, a total of 1.68 lakh voters exercised their franchise. The electoral strength will come down if the SCB implements the apex court's order. However, the CEO clarified that judgement will not be applicable to the voters enrolled for general election.
