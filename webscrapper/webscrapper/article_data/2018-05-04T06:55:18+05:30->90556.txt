MUMBAI:   seems to be keen to take a leaf out of India's book in its bid to fight infectious diseases like   (TB). 

 A team from the healthcare ministry of the province of Western Cape in South   will visit   for clues on Friday to understand how Maharashtra plans to eradicate TB by 2020 and to take notes on how medical care is dispensed in Mumbai's slums.
 
 It was PM Narendra Modi's campaign to eradicate TB by 2020 that had prompted the delegation from South Africa-a nation that is grappling with HIV-derived TB-to make the trip to India recently. After visiting New Delhi and Kerala for cues on community healthcare models, the team arrived in Mumbai on Thursday where they met the state health minister Deepak Sawant and some representatives from the NGO SNEHA (Society of Nutrition, Education and Health Action) whose efforts in partnership with the state left them impressed.
 
 Given that the rising price of medicines in South Africa-where 80% of the population depends on the free public healthcare system-posed challenges for the government, the fact that "even the poor go to private hospitals in India where medicines are affordable compared to South Africa" surprised Nomafrench Mbombo, minister of health from Western Cape.
 
 While the India trip has infected them with ideas for improving access to blood-testing centres, imbibing ayurveda and improving software applications in healthcare, it also made them aware of a few things India could learn from South Africa. Unlike South African public hospitals, which boast of nurses who can diagnose and prescribe medicines, the healthcare system in India is "physician-driven" and turns out to be expensive affair, said Mbombo, who felt India should invest in its nurses. She also did not quite understand why the poor in public hospitals in India needed to pay for medicines-a completely free affair in her nation. "When you are ill you are already weak and should not be expected to think of buying medication," said Mbombo.
