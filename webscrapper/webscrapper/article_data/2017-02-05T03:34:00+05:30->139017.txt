Panaji: Seventy-seven-year-old retired government doctor Leslie Saldanha collapsed on Saturday morning, immediately after he entered the polling station, located inside Mary Immaculate High School at Mala, Panaji, where he was to cast his vote. The senior citizen was shifted by ambulance to a nearby private hospital, where he breathed his last, North Goa collector Neela Mohanan told TOI.

 Saldanha’s neighbours said he walked to the polling station from his residence, which is just a stone’s throw away. He used to run his private practice from the same residence post retirement.
 
 “On entering the polling station, the senior citizen was interacting with a neighbour. He collapsed soon after, before he could cast his vote. I believe he expired due to a diabetes-related ailment,” said an official at the polling station. 
 
 Onlookers said there was no queue at the booth.
 
 Saldanha, who had retired as medical officer in the directorate of health services nearly two decades ago, had not been keeping good health for a few years.
 
 “But, on Saturday, he was in a jovial mood and asked me why I was not going to vote,” a neighbour said. 
 
 Saldanha was a well-known figure in Panaji. His last posting was as medical officer in the urban health centre, Panaji.
