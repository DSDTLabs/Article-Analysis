PANAJI: A two-day coastal security exercise, ‘Sagar Kavach’, will be held in Goa on April 18 and 19 to assess the efficiency of the coastal security mechanism. As part of the mock drill, security agencies will be involved in staging a ‘militant attack’ on public spaces, hospitals, or industrial establishments and other public places.

 The biannual exercise will involve all the agencies concerned with the objective of creating a seamless seaward security cover along Goa’s coastline.
 
 “The exercise will assess the effectiveness of coastal fishing community in serving as ‘eyes and ears’ for early warning of seaward threat,” the state government said in a note. “In this exercise, the service of   lifeguards present at the beaches of Goa will be utilized.” 
 
 The coastal security exercise is being supervised by chief secretary   and is being conducted and coordinated by the Indian Coast Guard, District Headquarters, Goa.
 
 “There is a three- or four-layered security tier,” said an official associated with the exercise. “We check the status of each of these tiers and the interoperability of the layers.” 
 
 Agencies like the Indian Coast Guard, Indian Navy, Goa Coastal Police, intelligence agencies, ports administration department,  , and customs will participate. 
 
 “Intelligence and infiltration will be induced and the alertness and preparedness of the stakeholders, including the people of Goa, will be tested,” said an official. “This exercise provides all stakeholders an opportunity to fine-tune standard operating procedure and test new operation concepts for coastal security.”
