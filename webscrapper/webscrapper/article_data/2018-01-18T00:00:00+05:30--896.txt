Over the past couple of days, jackets and boots have found their way back into cupboards, thick blankets are being replaced by thinner ones, and fans are being turned on at night across the city. Winter is officially over, and   seems to have begun just a little too soon in 2018. With 39.5 degrees Celsius being the highest-recorded temperature in April 2017, should we be bracing for an equally hot summer? Yes, says the MET department.
“If not worse, the temperature during summer this year is likely to be as high as last year. The maximum temperature this time of year should be around 27 degrees, but two days ago, we recorded it as 30 degrees — so, it’s already three degrees above normal. The minimum temperature has been 17 degrees, while it should be 16 degrees. There is also 16% increase in humidity, which is why we are feeling uncomfortable. If the wind flow pattern changes, then we may see normal temperatures,” says  , director, MET department.
 
 But  , coordinator/trustee,  , says that we can’t blame it on the wind flow. The fact that the city’s green cover is on a speedy decline means that things are not going to get better any time soon; it will only get worse. “We have lost 95% of vegetation in the built-up area of city. This is a substantial reason why there will be increase in temperature as we go forward. It’s not just about this year,” he warns. Leo points to studies, in which data over the last 20 years has shown that the temperature across the city has gone by 2-4 degrees, and suggests some crucial remedial measures:
