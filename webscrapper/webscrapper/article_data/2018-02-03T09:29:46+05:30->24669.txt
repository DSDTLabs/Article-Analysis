LUDHIANA: Before the nomination process for MC polls kicks off, candidates have started approaching civic officials for ‘no objection certificates’ (NOCs). The department has also started issuing NOCs after verifying that the applicants have deposited their taxes. However, civic officials are eyeing revenue generation through these NOCs, because anybody who wants to contest elections will have to first deposit their dues with MC. Zonal commissioners have designated one zonal superintendent and clerk for this task. Applicants are coming to MC offices with their applications, and officials will check whether candidates have filed their property tax, water, and sewerage dues. Officials claimed that while issuing NOCs, they are checking the property number and matching it with their records, and if the person has paid all dues, they are issuing the   to him/her immediately. 

 MC commissioner   said he had passed instructions to his staff for ensuring NOCs to candidates within 24 hours, so that there was no delay on their part. This NOC is required for candidates, because when they file their nomination papers for elections, this document will be checked first. One official claimed that in case a candidate does not show any property to MC while claiming the NOC, he could be caught because when he files his nomination papers, he would have to show everything. 
 
 Meanwhile, MC offices wore a deserted look on Friday, as after the imposition of a code of conduct, many officials were not available on their seats. Moreover, a review meeting for all projects under the central government will take place in Chandigarh on Saturday, where   minister   will participate. A team of MoUD officials conducted the meeting with officials from various MCs of the state, and reviewed various projects like Smart City Mission, Amrut Mission, Housing For All, etc.
