 Sana Shaikh, who bowled us over with her powerful performance in ' ', celebrates her 25th birthday today. And the youngster rang in her birthday in style. Her on-screen sister and real-life BFF   Malhotra was right by her side as she cut her birthday cake at the stroke of midnight. 

 
  
 A few pics from the birthday bash surfaced on social media. What caught our attention was the 'Dangal'-themed cake, with a miniature figurine of Geeta Phogat (her character in the film) on it. Also, don't miss how Fatima is making a birthday wish before blowing the candles. Praying for another blockbuster, are we? Another picture has Sanya posing next to her while Fatima gorges on the cake. Check out the pictures.
