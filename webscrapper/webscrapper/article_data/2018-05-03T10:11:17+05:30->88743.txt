Around the same time, the men robbed a petrol pump manager of Rs 35 lakh in Kundli, Haryana, and followed this up by shooting and robbing a businessman in Sonipat.

His gang members included Deepak, who had killed a man in 2009 and Gurcharan, a former NGO worker who used his contacts in security agencies to tip off the gang. The others were Vikas, a taxi driver, and Mahabir, a graduate who had started a dairy near Bhushan’s house.
