PATIALA: The state   has arrested the manager of   Cooperative   Bank here while   of Rs 10,000 from local farmer. He had sought money for releasing the subsidy amount given by the state government against a loan.

 According to the vigilance bureau, bank manager Satwinder Singh had demanded money from Gurpiyar Singh, a resident of Hariao village in Patiala. Gurpiyar had taken a dairy loan of Rs 8,82,000 from the bank and was entitled to receive a subsidy of Rs 32,000 from the state government under a welfare scheme. In lieu of releasing the subsidy amount on his loan, Satwinder demanded a bribe of Rs 10,000.
 
 Instead of succumbing to the pressure, the farmer reported the matter to the vigilance bureau, which laid a trap and asked him to strike a deal with the manager. As Gurpiyar met Satwinder to hand over the cash, the vigilance team caught the manager red-handed. Vigilance inspector Paramjit Kumar said a case under Sections 7 and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered against the accused at the Patiala office of the bureau.
