GUWAHATI:   in the state, along with   (AAP) and  , have fielded a   for the ensuing   to take on Congress and BJP. 

 Social activist Jadu Hazarika of CPM filed his nomination papers for the Dhemaji bypolls on Monday. His bid has been supported by the Left-Democratic Manch, Assam, comprising 11 parties - CPM, NCP, AAP, CPI, CPI (ML), Janata Dal (Secular), Samajwadi Party, Asom Sangrami Mancha, Liberal Democratic Party, AIFB and RCBI. The joint front expects to play an important role in forming a force against both Congress and BJP. The byelection will be held on April 9.
 
 "Rampant corruption during the 15-year Congress rule in Assam paved the way for BJP's rise," said Deben Bhattacharyya, convener of the 11-party forum. "The key issues, however, remain unaddressed. While demonetisation has hit the common people hard, BJP appears oblivious. We are striving to unite the secular and democratic forces but the anti-Congress and anti-BJP stand of the Manch will remain intact. If NCP decides to go with Congress, they will have to leave our joint front," he added. This comes as Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi tries to rope in NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to float an anti-BJP front.
 
 While the decision to field a consensus candidate did not prove to be of much help for the front in the recent Lakhimpur bypolls, the constituent parties of the umbrella organization have faith the alternative will work in the future. The slogan the front has resorted to for the bypolls is that it will defeat 'communal' BJP and 'corrupt' Congress.
 
 Dhemaji has been on the boil since the vandalization of the Silapathar office of the all-powerful All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) by the Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samannay Samiti (NBBUSS) activists this month. The front said preventing a communal outbreak is the challenge as of now. The NBBUSS has been demanding citizenship for Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh.
