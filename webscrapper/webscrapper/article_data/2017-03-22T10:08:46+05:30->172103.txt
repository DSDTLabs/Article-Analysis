HYDERABAD: In a strange incident, a burglar set on fire a house in   after he failed to find anything of value in it in the early hours of Wednesday. 

 According to Marredpally police, an unidentified person entered the house around 1 am. "We presume that he came to the house in a bid to steal. But when he found nothing in the house, he burnt it down in a fit of rage. We are trying to ascertain the identity of the person," Marredpally sub-inspector K Laxmi Narsaiah said.
 
 The   fire response department said they received a call from one of the neighbours saying that a fire had broken out in Nehru Nagar. "We received a phone call from their neighbours around 1.55 am. They told us about a fire in the neighbouring building and reported a lot of smoke," regional fire officer V Papaiah said. A fire tender and a bike-borne fire-fighting unit from the fire station in   were rushed to the spot.
 
 According to preliminary estimates, property worth 2 lakh was gutted. "Since the fire was confined to four walls of the house, there was some property damage. We managed to save property worth 5 lakh," he said.
