HYDERABAD: On the last day of sale of BSIII vehicles, crowds swelled outside auto showrooms to cash in on mindboggling discounts ranging from 8,000 to 30,000 on two-wheelers and 45,000 on three-wheelers on Friday. So much was the demand, that by noon, a majority of automobile dealerships in Hyderabad hung "no stock" boards. This is the first time automobile shops have run out of vehicles in the city. 

 With the BSIV norm coming into force on April 1, about 20,000 vehicles were sold in Telangana on Friday. On Thursday about 10,000 vehicles were sold. "We will get the exact figures only on April 1 as the sales are still on. The temporary registrations continued till late in the night," said Major PT Choudary (Rtd), former chairman of AP Motor Vehicle Dealers' Association. He said most four-wheeler brands were BSIV compliant. He said it would take about three to four months for the manufacturers to come out with the BSIV compliant two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
 
 While it was a windfall for those purchasing two-wheelers, owners of automobile showrooms complained that a simple change in the emission norms would not solve pollution woes. Emissions depend on three factors - fuel, vehicle and driving habits. "Indian automobile fuel, particularly diesel, is of poor quality with a lot of sulphur. It does not meet   quality standards. The condition of roads should also be improved as the average vehicle speed in Hyderabad is hardly 14 kmph," said Major Choudary (Rtd).
 
 The   will accept applications for permanent registrations for all BSIII vehicles that had temporary registrations prior to April 1. While a few customers were lucky to get quick loans, others pooled up funds from relatives. "A discount of 20,000 on a motorcycle is unimaginable. I got 30% discount on a new vehicle," said Venkat Rao, who bought a vehicle at a showroom on Raj Bhavan Road.
