Mumbai: A   at Bandra’s   promenade turned out to be a nightmare for a   from  .

 Cardiologist  , a senior citizen, left home around 6.30am on Wednesday for his routine walk. The Bandra resident said he usually does four rounds of the promenade from Otters Club to the Khar Danda end. However, on Wednesday, he had completed two rounds when he tripped and fell owing to the uneven surface of the promenade where stones are haphazardly strewn around. “My hand and knee was injured and started to bleed. Thankfully, a good Samaritan, who teaches slum children on the promenade, had a first-aid kit. The promenade has been under repair for almost a year now inconveniencing hundreds of walkers and joggers,” said Dr Pahlajani.
 
 Citizen activist Anandini Thakoor said the doctor’s injuries could have been far worse considering the pathetic condition of the entire stretch. “His injury could have been much more serious. The promenade has been in a state of disrepair for months now and nobody seems to care about it,” she said.
 
 The   (MMB) was in the process of carrying out   and beautification of the promenade for a year now. Owing to the monsoon, the work was put on hold. 
 
 Local corporator Asif Zakaria pointed out that even before the onset of monsoon, the work was being carried out in a slip-shod manner. “There have been several complaints from locals that the rubble lying all over was hampering their walks,” said Zakaria. Area MLA Ashish Shelar said the contractor had been blacklisted for tardy and poor quality work and tenders had been floated for appointment of a new contractor.
 
 An MMB official said while work on the retaining wall work had been completed, tiling work had not even started. He said the repair works were to be completed by September 30, but with a change in contractor now, this deadline would be missed.
