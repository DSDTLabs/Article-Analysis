NEW DELHI/PAKISTAN: India flatly rejected on Friday Pakistan's accusation that four women and two men were killed and over 20 injured in "unprovoked" cross-border firing, stressing that the   had opened fire only to retaliate against ceasefire violations by   Rangers in the Jammu/Sialkot sector. 

 Director general of military operations (DGMO) Lt-General A K Bhatt also bluntly told his Pakistan counterpart Major General Sahir Shamshad Mirza over the hotline that the Indian forces "reserved the right to retaliate appropriately to any incident leading to loss of life".
 
  The Pakistan foreign office, on its part, summoned Indian high commissioner Gautam Bambawale in   to hand him a demarche to protest against "the killing of civilians in the unprovoked ceasefire violations by Indian troops at Charwa" along the international boundary (IB) on Thursday. 
 
 But when the Pakistan DGMO also got in touch with his Indian counterpart for unscheduled hotline talks on Friday to lodge a similar protest, Lt-Gen Bhatt clearly told him the BSF had "responded appropriately", without any deliberate targeting of Pakistani civilians, to firing initiated by the Pakistan Rangers.
 
  BSF troops have initiated firing in some other instances to thwart attempts by armed intruders to infiltrate from proximity of Pakistani posts along the border in Amritsar. Underlining that infiltration across the LoC with "active support" of Pakistan army's forward posts had shown no signs of abating, Lt-Gen Bhatt said this was adversely "impacting peace" along the border, as well as the internal security situation in J&K.
 
 "The DGMO said there were also continuing attempts to target our troops through sniping and other cross-border actions. He reiterated the   was sincere about efforts to maintain peace along the LoC provided there was a reciprocal effort," said a senior officer.
 
 The Indian Army has over the last few months repeatedly told the Pakistan army to desist from actively abetting cross-border terrorism and infiltration, warning that all misadventures would be met with retaliatory punitive fire assaults.
