CHENNAI: It was in September 2015 that the   government assured the Madras high court that tenders for meters with printers and GPS for autorickshaws had been called for, and that they would be installed in autorickshaws within six months after the tender is reopened. No much progress has happened since then, and no GPS has been fixed on autorickshaws.

 The issue has now found a mention in the CAG report which said though the   and GPS were meant to track vehicles and ensure that only approved fare was collected from passengers, the exercise was yet to see the light of day, the said.
 
 In September 2015, the Madras high court initiated contempt of court proceedings against officials saying they had wilfully disobeyed its October 30, 2014, order in which it had laid down eight directions, including revision of fares as per fuel price variation, creation of a toll-free number for lodging complaints and display of driver/owner details in the vehicle.
 
 The government, however, filed a counter-affidavit saying it would introduce GPS-based meters for autorickshaws within six months. The then first bench comprising the then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (since elevated to the   as judge) and Justice TS Sivagnanam, recorded the undertaking and said authorities "shall remain bound by the same."
 
 The PIL was filed by Coimbatore Consumer Voice.
