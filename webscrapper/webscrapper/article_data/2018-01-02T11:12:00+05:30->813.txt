UJJAIN:   of a   and her 8-year-old daughter were   in a   on the outskirts of Ujjain town on Monday morning.

 The woman had left the house for withdrawing money from a bank on December 26 and has been missing ever since, police said.
 
 The bodies of   (30) and her daughter Nisha, a student of Class III, were noticed by villagers in a canal that fed water to Sahebkhedi pond, following which they informed the   police. 
 
 The police immediately circulated their photograph following which their identities were ascertained. 
 
 Ghatia police station in-charge JR Chouhan said Subhash Shankar, brother of deceased identified the bodies and claimed that Shantabai had left the house to withdraw money from a bank branch in Indira Nagar. She and Nisha had not returned home.
 
 Shantabai’s husband, a resident of village Ralayata Bhoja, had died a few years ago. She was staying with her brother since then. 
 
 Chouhan said that their bodies were found half submerged in water. “The canal had scanty water. This rules out that they had drowned,” he said.
 
 A team of forensic experts examined the spot and claimed that the bodies were around six days old. “No signs of struggle were seen at the crime scene, indicating that the bodies were thrown by someone,” forensic expert   said.
 
 Investigators were told by Subhash that Shantabai had a mobile phone, which was switched off since her disappearance. The phone and footwear of the deceased were also not found on the spot, giving strength to the notion that the crime was committed elsewhere.
 
 “The exact cause of death will be known after a post-mortem examination,”   said.
 
 Police have registered a case of murder and further probe was on.
