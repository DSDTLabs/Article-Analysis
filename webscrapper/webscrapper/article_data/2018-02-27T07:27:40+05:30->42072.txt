PALANPUR: Over two years after a Patidar man died in police firing in Gadh village near Palanpur during quota stir violence, his 30-year-old nephew has threatened self-immolation if the government does not agree to his demands.

  Patel, nephew of Kanu Patel, was arrested in Palanpur on Sunday and released on bail later. Kanu and Mahesh died after police opened fire when a mob of Patidars had gheraoed the Gadh police station on August 26.
 
 Patel submitted the memorandum to   collector warning of immolation demanding government jobs to the kin of Patidars killed in police firing, stringent action against the policemen and withdrawal of cases against the Patidars. He threatened to immolate himself if the demands were not met by March 5.
 
 On Monday, large number of Patidars protested against Brijeshâ€™s arrest. 
 
 Bhavin Patel, the district convener of   (PAAS), said further course of agitation will be decided as per the guidance of quota stir leader Hardik Patel.
