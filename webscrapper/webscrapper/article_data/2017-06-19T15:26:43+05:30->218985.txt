 ' season 7 is all set to premiere in July and we have been waiting for it for too long.
 
    finally dropped an official trailer on Wednesday (May 24), teasing a 'Great War'.
  
  The new trailer shows Cersei Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen clashing while Jon Snow contends with the threat of White Walkers in the North. It also shows the date of Jaime, Arya and Jorah.
  
  
 
  
  In the trailer, Cersei intones that the Lannisters have “enemies to the East, enemies to the West, enemies to the South, [and] enemies to the North — whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it.”
  
  Also we see Littlefinger encouraging Jon’s half-sister Sansa to look for opportunities now that she is one of the last Starks still standing.
  
  
 
  
  And as Danenerys marches with her army towards Kings Landing, we can't miss the savage, massive dragons flying over all of them.
  
  Yes, the Great War is here!
