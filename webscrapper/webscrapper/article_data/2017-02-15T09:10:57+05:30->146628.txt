NEW DELHI: Sandeep Singh (30) has been driving an   for the past two years. He has been hit hard by the ongoing protests. These days, he sleeps on the back seat of his cab in order to save money on accommodation.

  Another driver joining him at the protests at Jantar Mantar — Mohammad Khalid (36) — has shifted to a shanty near RK Puram recently after he was unable to pay rent for the past two months. A majority of Ola and Uber   have similar stories to narrate.
 
 According to the drivers, the situation has gone from bad to worse in the past couple of months.
 
  “I have three children. Not only I have to pay their school fees, but also the instalments for my car. Earlier, I would earn Rs 3,000-4,000 per day, but now working 16 hours a day fetches me Rs 2,000 only,” said Khalid. “I bought this car because of the incentives and now, rules have changed completely. How will I repay the instalments and afford good education for my children?” 
 
 Jatin, an Uber driver, said he earned Rs 21,000 last month from the incentives, of which Rs 15,000 was spent on the car’s instalment. 
 
 “It has become very difficult for us to survive with the money we are getting,” added Jatin.
 
 Many drivers claim their earnings were around Rs 60,000 a month two years ago, which have come down to Rs 25,000 at present. They say the number of rides has gone down, forcing them to spend anywhere between 15 and 20 hours on the road. 
 
 “You are in the car for close to 16 hours a day but the money you earn has gone down considerably. Even in terms of rides, one gets only six or seven a day now,” said Nihal Singh, another driver.
