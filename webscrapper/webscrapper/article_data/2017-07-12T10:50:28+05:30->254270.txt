J.K. Rowling penned another fairy tale for children, but this time it would be sealed inside her closet.

  In an interview with CNN, the bestselling author of the   series revealed that she wrote the manuscript of a story for young readers on a party dress, where it might remain in perpetuity. Rowling revealed the fact in response to the question if the author was ready to give the world another fairy tale. 
 
  The Harry Potter creator confessed that on the occasion of her 50th birthday she hosted a party with a theme: “come as your own private nightmare.” Her costume for her own party was a lost manuscript for a “political” fairy tale for children. 
 
  Rowling said, “I wrote over a dress most of that book… So that book, I don’t know whether it will ever be published, but it’s actually hanging in a wardrobe currently.” Rowling did not provide any additional detail about the story. 
 
  The final book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," was released 10 years ago. Since then, J.K. Rowling has published several supplementary books, some print and some electronic, about Harry and   School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
