Jaipur: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday petitioned the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) seeking the disqualification of 10 parliamentary secretaries in Rajasthan.

 A representation to this effect was filed by P C Bhandari, party state coordinator, legal cell. The petition said the legally permissible size of the Rajasthan ministry was 30, which is 15% of the size of the assembly. But the present size of the ministry stood at 40, including 10 parliamentary secretaries. These secretaries have been given the same status as ministers of state.
 
 The petition said that parliamentary secretaries cannot be excluded from ministers. They were also given salary, staff, offices at both the secretariat and in the assembly, and luxury cars, etc. According to Section 164(I) of the Constitution, this is a violation.
 
 In the case of Assam, the Supreme Court had ruled that the state governments could not create the posts of parliamentary secretaries and had declared as unconstitutional the Assam Parliamentary Secretaries (Appointment, Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2004. The same applies in the case of Rajasthan, it was argued.
