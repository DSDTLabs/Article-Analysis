It is no news that there is little love lost between India and Pakistan, and generations on both sides of the border have failed miserably in finding a resolution to this deep-seeded enmity. ' ', a play starring   and  , which was staged in the capital recently, attempts to capture this helplessness. At a time when India-Pakistan relations are simmering, and when #BadlaLo is trending on social media, the   directed play raises pertinent questions about relations between the two countries. As the director puts it, "We are going back in our relation with each other rather than forward. At a time like that, I feel that there is a need for person to person contact."

  The play, which opened the first edition of Delhi Theatre Festival, is an Indian adaptation by   and Randeep Hooda of American playwright Lee Blessing's 'A Walk In The Woods'. It depicts a dialogue between Indian diplomat Ram Chinappa (Rajit Kapur) and his cynical Pakistani counterpart Jamaluddin Lutfullah (Naseeruddin Shah) over different meetings in six months, as they walk through the woods of Geneva, Switzerland. Naseeruddin Shah and Rajit Kapur have performed the play in different cities, including Lahore, and once even in front of LK Advani, too.
