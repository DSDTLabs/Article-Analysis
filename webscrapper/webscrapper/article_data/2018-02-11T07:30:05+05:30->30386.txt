SURAT:   ( ), a non-governmental organization, plans to file a petition in the   (NGT) for issuance of a directive to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to take necessary steps to increase flow of water from   for the maintenance of the ecosystem of river Narmada.

 NPNS trustee Jayesh Patel told TNN, “We together with   and other groups are in advance stage of filing a petition in the NGT. We will request for the issuance of a directive from NGT in the context of its recent order on river Ganga that minimum environmental flow of 20 per cent needs to be maintained for continuity of aquatic ecosystem. All states were directed to maintain a minimum environmental flow of 15 to 20 per cent of the average lean season course in their rivers. The same is applicable to river Narmada’s flow too.” 
 
 Bharuch Citizen Council president Jivraj Patel said, “We can’t close our eyes the way downstream is being treated. The decision of releasing water at the rate of 600 cusecs downstream was wrong as none had visualized its long-term impact on the river’s ecosystem. Technocrats should know that once seawater ingress reaches up to 60km inside the river basin, it will be impossible to check salinity.” 
 
 A Gandhian   said, “Over 75 per cent of Gujarat now is dependent on water supplied through canals for drinking, irrigation and industrial use. This will lead to a major disaster in future because we don’t have any alternative source. If things are not set right now, water riots cannot be ruled out in future in the state.”
