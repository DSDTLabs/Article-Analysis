CHANDIGARH: Continuing with their changes in the  , Punjab local bodies minister   on Wednesday removed all chairmen and members appointed by the SAD-BJP regime across several trusts in the state. He announced that the trusts would now be headed by IAS officers of the rank of DCs and SDMs appointed by the government.

 This is the second such key decision by the Congress government in the last 24 hours when they have countered Akali policies of appointing their men on key posts, the most recent being installing an IAS officer as PSPCL chairman.
 
 There are 28 trusts operating in the state with annual budget between Rs 100-500 crore to conceive, design and construct   in and outside the towns.
 
 “The politically appointed chairmen and trustees of the improvement trusts across Punjab have been relieved with immediate effect,” quipped Sidhu and added, “The decision has been taken to ensure greater transparency and efficiency in the working of these trusts.”
 
 Sidhu and several   in the last government, including their party chief Sukhbir Badal, had a long standing tiff over non-completion of urban development projects, including solid waste management plant, special economic zone, four-laning of big roads and CCTV camera installations in cities. It was their stand-off which had forced Sidhu to first lose bid to contest Amritsar Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and then lead to his ejection from the BJP last year before joining the Congress.
 
 Sidhu, however, issued directions to his department, saying that no ongoing development work would be stopped due to any political vendetta. The minister had directed the engineering wing of the department to conduct surprise inspections and get third party audit of these works carried out to ensure quality in the execution of these works.
