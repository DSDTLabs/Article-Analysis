ROURKELA:   and   once again expressed his displeasure at the inordinate delay in starting the construction of the second  , a promise made by none other than   

 Ray's remark against his party came a day after his tweet on construction of barrages over two rivers by   government would reduce water flow to five districts of Odisha. He also demanded convening a special assembly session to discuss the issue.
 
 Ray is not happy with the delay in construction work of the second Brahmani bridge, which was promised by Modi while addressing an election rally at Rourkela in the run-up to 2014 general elections. 
 
 Ray has been claiming that his priority is mati (soil) and then party. While speaking to a section of the media here on Sunday, Ray said he feels sorry about the delay. 
 
 Since Modi had announced the construction of the second Brahmani bridge twice here at Rourkela - one before the elections and again one year later while addressing the RSP modernization dedication programme - people of the city were optimistic. "But after three years, there is no sign of the project for which I feel ashamed," Ray said. When asked if he is going to take any strong step for that, he said, "I am considering that and will let you know as soon as I take a decision in that respect."
 
 Ray's statement came a day after his controversial tweet in which he said BJP-led Jharkhand government's move is detrimental to Odisha. In his tweet, Ray claimed that two barrages - one at Gumla over Shankha river and another at Karo over Koel river - has decreased water flow to Odisha.
