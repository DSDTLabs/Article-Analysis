 “There being no response in the matter, an application under Right to Information Act ( ) filed in August 2016 revealed that I was to take it up with the police,” Singh said in his complaint.
 
 The former MP said, after he received a reply to the RTI this year, he registered a complaint with the cops and requested them to scan through the CCTV footages of his office at the Parliament to check the person who had entered his room and put in the file containing the query. In his complaint, Singh named four people, including the editor of a media house as well.
 
 Singh claimed that the forged document and impersonation had damaged his reputation and career.
 
 Police said that a case has been registered under Section 468 IPC (forgery for purpose of cheating) and Section 471 IPC (using a forged document as genuine) has been registered. A probe would be conducted into the allegation, they said.
 
 Singh was an MP from Gwalior who was expelled from Parliament after a special committee of the Lok Sabha found him guilty and called for a motion for expulsion along with 11 others.
 
 He was accused of raising questions in the Parliament in lieu of cash.
