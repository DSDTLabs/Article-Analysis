NAGPUR: Expressing concern over lack of development in   revenue division, comprising five districts, former member of   ( )   has appealed to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to provide a special package in the upcoming state budget so as to kick-start several projects.

 In a letter to the CM,   said, “I expect the state to announce at least Rs20,000 crore for overall development of the division as part of a five-year plan. Development of proper irrigation infrastructure and road network is long overdue.”
 
 Khadakkar, also a former nominee of chancellor on Nagpur University’s Management Council, quoted data secured from VSDB and the state’s Economic Survey in his letter. According to this data, irrigation backlog in the division is 9.12 lakh hectares as on June 2014. When compared to the backlog in rest of Vidarbha at 10.33 lakh hectares the same year, Amravati division’s share stands at 88.30%.
 
 The figures also show that growth in irrigation capacity in the division was only 8.97% compared to growth in rest of the state at 55.30% between 1960 and 2014. Also, out of the division’s 3,137.60 hectares area under agriculture, only 904.57 hectares (28.83%) is under irrigation. The ratio of total agriculture land to irrigated land in Nagpur division is 65% and 57.91 %, respectively.
 
 Khadakkar also estimated an expense of Rs3,103.82 crore on agricultural pumps in the division to arrive at par with state’s average of 2,54,412 pumps.
 
 The target for expansion of road network in Amravati division is proportionally less compared to the rest of the state, which is part of the government’s 20-year programme since 2001, informs Khadakkar. This means that the division’s total area is 46,035 sqkm and the targeted length of roads is 42,340.58 kms bringing the ratio to 1:0.92, he said. In contrast, the total area of Western Maharashtra and   combined is 1,45,672 sqkm and targeted road length is 1,77,173.28 kms. The ratio here is 1:1.22. Similarly, the proportion for Vidarbha is 1:1 and for Nagpur it’s 1:1.08. So far, only 28,553 kms (67% of the target) of roads in the division have been built, Khadakkar said adding 92% of the target has been achieved in the entire state.
