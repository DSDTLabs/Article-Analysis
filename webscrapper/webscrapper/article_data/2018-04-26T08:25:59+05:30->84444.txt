CHENNAI: Almost a year after the city police launched an initiative to connect with the representatives of residents welfare associations on a real time basis through WhatsApp, groups created on the messaging app for several localities along the   remain dormant. Residents welfare associations complained that cops are not responding to any issue posted on the groups.

 Coordinator of Federation of OMR Residents Associations (FOMRRA) Harsha Koda said the WhatsApp platform was effective when it was created in April 2017. “Last year, when I posted about vehicles carrying employees of information technology companies encroaching upon a road at Sholinganallur, the police responded quickly to resolve the issue. One year down the line, the same stretch of public road has been taken over by private vans. There was no action though I am posting the grievance frequently (on the WhatsApp) group,” he added. Harsha Koda is part of two police WhatsApp groups falling under two police stations such as Chemmanchery and Kannagi Nagar. 
 
 However, an officer from Chemmanchery police station denied the allegations and said the police are acting on the grievances posted on the group.
 
 WhatsApp groups for every police station within greater Chennai are administered by the respective inspectors. A group was suppossed to be consisted of the deputy commissioner of police, a sub-inspector and members of wellfare associations. An inspector at North Chennai police station said the WhatsApp group was active till a month after it came into being and then it became defunct.
 
 When contacted, a senior police officer said police WhatsApp groups are active within the limits of Tiruvanmiyur and Kanathur police stations. The officer said some residents posted unrelatable complains like dumping of garbage, which do not fall under the responsibilities of the police.
