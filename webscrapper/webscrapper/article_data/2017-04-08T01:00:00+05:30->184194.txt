I feel like I have found a new family in these talented kids,” says  , who is currently busy hosting the   Season 1 on a popular channel. “It’s always fun to host these kind of reality shows as they leave you in splits with their counters, and sense of humour.” 

 The VJ also recalls one of the episodes of hers, which had actor Shiva as the judge. “It was fun to have him. He thoroughly enjoyed the show, and loved the concept.” All your TV shows are coming up with many seasons, do you think you are considered a lucky charm? “Starting from  , Naalaya Iyakunar,  , and now Junior Senior, all my shows have been received well by the audience and have come up with many seasons. I don’t think its because of my luck factor, rather I would say that I am lucky to be part of all innovative shows. I always believe that my work must talk for itself,” she says, adding, “I don’t want to do shows, which don’t impress me.” On foraying into big screen, she says, “Well, it may happen anytime if something really nice comes up. If at all I get to act with my hubby, Shanthnu, somewhere in future that would be the best thing in my life as we can all be ourselves. Acting may come naturally, then (laughs).”
