NEW DELHI:   lost to arch-rival Carolina Marin in the quarter-final of the   on Friday. The Spaniard exacted revenge for her loss at the final of the India Open earlier this month by a comprehensive 21-11, 21-15 win.

 Marin's swift movement across court and powerful smashes caught Sindhu off guard as the Indian looked out of her elements. The only period where Sindhu looked like mustering some offence was during the closing stage of the first game where she bagged four points on the trot. Otherwise, it was a clinical performance by Marin, who took a dominating lead of 16-9. A few unlucky points, when the shuttle deflected off the net, didn't help Sindhu either.
 
 Game two was no different. Marin raced to an 8-2 advantage before stretching it to 13-6 with some amazing court coverage and smashes targetted at Sindhu's body. The Indian succeeded with her challenge in Game 1 but couldn't quite in the second. Sindhu scored a few points to show some life, but by then the scoreline was already in Marin's favour at 19-13. Sindhu could take two more points before Marin sealed the game and sailed through to the semi-final.
