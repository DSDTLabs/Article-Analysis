NEW DELHI: Galloping crude took a pause on Thursday, with global benchmark Brent slipping nearly 1% on prospects of Opec winding down its two-year production deal to fill possible supply gaps from   and  . The fall, though marginal, reinforces the view in the government to wait for a market correction and use that time to find a long-term fix to deal with oil price volatility.

 
 Respite for consumers, however, will come only if the downturn in prices continue for some time. Pump prices rose for the 11
  straight day after state-run fuel retailers resumed daily price revisions after the May 12   assembly poll.
 
 Oil minister   in Bhubaneswar said the Centre is deliberating on an “immediate solution” to rising fuel prices “till petroleum products are brought under GST”. Law minister   had on Wednesday said the government is working on a “long-term solution”.
 
 The view in the government is that a market correction is ahead since the price rally is the handiwork of speculators and not based on market fundamentals. Under the circumstance it is better to wait before tinkering with the excise duty on fuels, which will eat into the government’s budget. Every Re 1 cut in excise costs Rs 13,000 crore annual revenue.
 
 Several options are being tossed around in the meantime. These include slapping windfall tax on oil produced by state-run ONGC and OIL. The tax may kick in beyond $70 per barrel price. But such a move will bring to question the government’s commitment to oil reforms and may not serve much purpose as just about 30% of oil comes from domestic fields.
 
 The political imperative for providing immediate relief too gone with the completion of Karnataka poll. Elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh are in November. There’s then ample time for the government to wait for oil price correction.
