PORVORIM: The government will present   and new schemes for employment generation, education and the social sector before March 31, CM Manohar   indicated on Thursday while outlining the broad focus for the coming financial year.

 Parrikar, who returned from Mumbai’s   barely hours earlier, refrained from presenting a full budget and instead sought a vote on account for five months to keep the government running. Among the sectors to get the most allocation are education, industry, information technology, and infrastructure.
 
 “My health has prevented me from preparing a detailed budget speech outlining the achievement, policies and new schemes of our government. However, by the end of financial year 2017-18, I will implement the new schemes as well as measures for revenue generation, which involve rationalisation and creation of fees, taxes and duties, so that they get implemented from the beginning of next year,” Parrikar said.
 
 The chief minister said he had already allocated the required funds to implement the outlined schemes. “I have made provisions for the inclusion of new schemes in the proposed budget,” he said.
 
 Parrikar has kept aside Rs 331.2 crore for information technology, a Rs 162.2-crore jump over the previous financial year’s allocation. Similarly for the department of industries, trade and commerce, Parrikar has allocated Rs 217.7 crore for 2018-19, a massive rise from the Rs 94.9 crore that was sanctioned in 2017-18.
 
 For PWD, water resources and other infrastructure projects, Parrikar has allocated Rs 2,922.4 crore for 2018-19, a Rs 143.4-crore rise compared to the funds sanctioned earlier.
 
 Sources suggest that Parrikar is expected to streamline social security schemes such as   and Griha Aadhaar to curb leakage of funds through non-deserving applicants.
 
 In the field of education, including medical education, Rs 2,445 crore has been budgeted. Parrikar is expected to outline how the funds will be spent before the year-end.
