NEW DELHI: Had Aparna Kalra not been a familiar face around Picnic Hut park, she would have been left unattended for hours. Locals knew that she was a journalist as she had defended the rights of women and inquired about civic problems from street vendors in the area.

 The 45-year-old freelance contributor to online news websites had earlier worked with mainstream publications, including TOI. Family members said that it was usual for her to go for an evening stroll at the park leaving her phone at home. “She usually took a few rounds along the walking track and often spoke to people on the way back, as most journalists would do,“ said a relative, H C Bhatia.
 
 Karla and her sister,  , a teacher with   , stay with their parents in B-Block of Ashok Vihar-III. Her father,  , retired as an economist from Indian Institute of Applied Economics and Research.
 
 Prachi said her sister often shared her experiences as a journalist and discussed stories before they were published. “If she had received any threats, she would have told me. Most of her stories were related to education and women's issues, which are unlikely to have attracted anyone's ire,“ she said.
 
 Also, the family didn't notice anything suspicious. “She always spoke against wrongdoings and talked about women's issues. We suspect that she might have protested against something she saw at the park. This may have led to an argument after which she must have been attacked,“ said Prachi.
 
 On Wednesday, Kalra gained consciousness for some time during which she mentioned that she was attacked. “We are waiting for her to recover so that she can give her statement to the cops,“ Prachi said.
