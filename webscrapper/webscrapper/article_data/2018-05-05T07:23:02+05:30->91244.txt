KOCHI: Economic empowerment is important for women, said former foreign secretary   on Friday. Inaugurating the   organized by Kerala Management Association here, Rao said that lack of economic empowerment denotes confinement for women. 

 Rao said that the situation of women in the world is like a many-hued rainbow in which there is a shade of darkness as well as areas of light.
 
 Regarding the   bilateral relationship, Rao said that informal summit between Prime Minister   and Chinese President Xi Jinping is a good move and added that such meetings would play a significant role in improving the relationship and bilateral ties shared between both countries.
 
 Rao also condemned the rape and murder of a minor in Kathua. 
 
 "I am deeply concerned and affected by the atrocities and inhuman treatment meted out to women and humanity. Such incidents should never happen again. We should collectively come forward to put an end to such heinous crimes," she said.
