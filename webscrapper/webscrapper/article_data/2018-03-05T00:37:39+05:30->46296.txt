Chennai: Despite eight months having passed since the Tamil Nadu   ( ) came into being, the state government is yet to appoint a full-fledged chairperson for the realty regulator. The secretary to the housing and urban development department is functioning as the interim   for the authority which aims to protect the interests of homebuyers.

 According to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, state governments must establish the real estate regulatory authority within a period of one year from the date of the act coming into force through a notification. The authority must consist of a chairperson and not less than two full-time members. 
 
 The state government had notified the Tamil Nadu Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017 on June 22, 2017. Former Madras high court judge Justice B Rajendran was nominated as the chairperson of the Tamil Nadu's real estate appellate tribunal. However, the chairman and members for the real estate authority are yet to be appointed.
 
 Ramaprabhu, honorary secretary of the  ' Association of India's Southern Centre, Chennai, said a full-time chairman and members were essential for smooth functioning of the authority. "Their presence is required for swift action and quick disposal of the grievances of homebuyers," he said.
 
 A top official with the union housing ministry said, "A full-fledged chairman is necessary because interim chairmen could be handling a variety of issues. We have urged eight major states to appoint a chairman at the earliest." State housing and urban development department secretary S Krishnan was not available for comment.
