The entertainment tax target was Rs 29 crore of which the administration could collect Rs 28.24 crore and the recovery from other cases was Rs 26.02 crore taking the total to Rs 54.26 crore,” the officer said.
 
 “The minor minerals target was Rs 89 crore, but the actual recovery has been Rs 96.88 crore — above nine per cent. The special measures included conducting raids on trucks carrying loads of sand illegally and also illegal excavation of sand and penalising them for the same,” the officer added.
 
 The collection of land revenue, however, was way below the target. The target for land revenue was Rs 91.42 crore and recovery was only Rs 63.91 core.
