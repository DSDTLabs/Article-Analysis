CHENNAI:   regretted skipping work on Tuesday. She and a few other women had been waiting by the roadside since 3 pm on   in New Washermenpet to wave at AIADMK (Amma) candidate   as he went past them in his campaign vehicle. 

 At 6 pm, and still no sign of Dhinakaran, Rajeswari broke her silence. "Do you want me to lie or speak the truth?" she replied, to a question whether she supported Dhinakaran. "We were promised 200 each if we showed up to wave at him. Those (women) who throw flower petals at him (Dhinakaran) have been promised 500 each. Those who take the arathi (a hindu welcoming custom) will get 100 each and the people who hold up the steel pot and coconut (given by the  ) to his jeep will be paid around 200 each and given a sari," she said. The households which received money, and whose doors Dhinakaran would knock and seek votes from during the campaign, had kolams laid out in their front as markers. 
 
 "Amma (Jayalalithaa) was never late during her campaign," said a woman in her 60s, identifying herself as Margaret. But they wouldn't leave the place before Dhinakaran arrived. "The party men are waiting at street corners to stop us from leaving," said Rajeswari.
 
 But there were others like  , who claimed to be an AIADMK party man from Coimbatore and said that he came down to RK Nagar to support Dhinakaran because of his "love and respect" for Sasikala. "People of RK Nagar need to vote for Dhinakaran," he said, standing just outside the DMK party office building on Cross Road.
 
 "TTV sir has the power. If he commands, even the chief minister has to obey. He leads the party and if he becomes the MLA, just imagine what it could do for RK Nagar's development," Ganesan said.
