HYDERABAD: A potential revolt is brewing in the   (TJAC) with its convener   and two others launching a broadside against its chairman   on Tuesday. In an open letter, the three senior functionaries of the organisation told Kodandaram that any status he enjoys in the society is a result of “all of us approving you to be the   chairman.” They further told Kodandaram: “You are not realising this fact.”

 In the letter, Ravinder, along with TJAC co-convener Tanveer Sultana and co-chairman Nallapu Prahlad also demanded an explanation from Kodandaram on “what sacrifices, if any, Kodandaram made during the prolonged agitation for a separate Telangana state.”
 
 In what is being viewed in political circles as a precursor to potential desertions from the TJAC, if not a split, the trio also accused Kodandaram of “feudal mentality” and that he had no clue of the sacrifices many like them in TJAC had made during the struggle for Telangana. 
 
 They also took objection to the TJAC morphing into a political entity despite its avowed stand to stay apolitical. “How can you speak of the need for a party on the lines of   in Telangana from the TJAC platform?” they asked.
 
 It may be recalled that ever since the February 22 crackdown by the government on TJAC proposed march by the unemployed and a public meeting in the city, Ravinder had been making his intentions of taking on Kodandaram clear questioning the decision to go ahead with the protest as planned and not following government advice on the location of the venue for the public meeting.
