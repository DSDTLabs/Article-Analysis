KOZHIKODE:   state president   has demanded a judicial inquiry into the alleged atrocities perpetrated against the tribal community in   and also into the lapses in the implementation of crores of rupees-worth central and state government development projects there in the past three decades.

 Addressing a news conference here on Sunday,   also demanded the resignation of tribal welfare minister A K Balan, taking the moral responsibility for the mob lynching of tribal youth Madhu in Attapadi .
 
 Kummanam said the killing was not a lone incident and there had been 63 cases of murders of tribespeople in Attapadi during the last 35 years. In four cases the victims were reportedly burnt to death.
 
 “Unfortunately the police have not made any headway in those cases. The BJP will collect details of those cases and will publish a report within in a week,” he added.
 
 Alleging that the Kerala government has not submitted utilization certificate for the Rs 500 crore central fund to Attappadi, the initial instalments of which had been allotted to the state, Kummanam asked the government to bring out a white paper on the utilization of central and state funds released for Attapadi.
 
 “Since all the development projects implemented in the tribal region have been a failure, the government should review them,” he said. He added that the failure to ensure the continuity of the   (AHADS) project had adversely affected the livelihoods of tribespeople in the area.
 
 The meeting of the state unit of the NDA scheduled to be held in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday would finalize the agitation to be launched raising the demands, he said.
