GURUGRAM: Three   working at a construction site suffocated to death on Friday after being buried under excavated earth while digging a sewage line in Sector 76. 

 
 The three men have been identified as Sajid (22), Aarif (21) and Naushad (22) — all residents of Ghaziabad. 
 
 Sources said they were working on the site since Friday morning. They were going further down as they excavated earth and mounted it on the side but the pile caved in on them. 
 
 The three were rescued by the other workers who were at the spot and rushed to the Park hospital in Sector 47. Two were declared brought dead and the third worker succumbed to his injuries later in the night. 
 
 The work was being undertaken by Huda through a third party contractor. When approached for a comment, cops said that they were investigating the matter. “We are trying to identify the contractor and an FIR will be registered once the families lodge a complaint,” said Dinesh Kumar, SHO, Kherki Daula police station. He added that the families of the three workers had been intimated about the incident. 
 
 Sources claimed the administration and cops didn’t know about the incident till late on Friday evening. 
 
 In a similar incident on March 26, two labourers working at a sewage construction site in Hailey Mandi, Pataudi, suffocated to death after a pile of debris fell on them. Bhola (23) and Attar Singh (22), both from Uttar Pradesh, were buried for nearly three hours before they were rescued and found dead.
 
 The lack of safety measures at construction sites often causes such incidents in the city but the government departments stay indifferent to the same. 
 
 Last week, a security guard fell into an open drain being constructed by Huda through a third party contractor and died. However, no action has been taken in the matter yet.
