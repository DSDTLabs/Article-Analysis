GURUGRAM: A city   on Monday directed CBI to file a supplementary   by   4 in murder of a Class II student at a Bhondsi school.

 While the agency already filed the chargesheet on February 5, accusing a Class XI student of slitting the throat of the seven-year-old boy of the same school, the supplementary chargesheet is likely to highlight the role of the school administration and Gurugram police, which investigated the case before it was handed over to CBI.
 
 In the day, CBI filed an application seeking another one and a half months to complete the investigation. Last month, the court had set May 14 as the   for the agency to file the final report in the case.
 
 Accepting the agency’s plea, additional sessions judge   reserved its order on a plea filed by the 16-year-old student, challenging the Juvenile Justice Board’s order on December 2017 to treat the Class XI student as an adult. The court said the hearing on the matter would begin on July 4.
 
 Advocate Sandeep Aneja, the accused’s counsel, argued the juvenile board had passed the order without waiting for probe agency to file chargesheet. He also argued the board declared the juvenile as adult on the basis of a social and psychological test of the child, without giving them an opportunity to challenge the report.
 
 However, advocate Sushil Tekriwal, lawyer appearing for the seven-year-old boy’s father, said the JJB’s order was ‘well-reasoned’ and there was ‘no fault’ or ‘illegal’ in the order. In the chargesheet containing total 29 volumes, the CBI had claimed to have found enough evidence against the Class XI student who was picked up by the agency in November last year for allegedly slitting the throat of the Class II student apparently to postpone exams and a parent-teacher meeting in September.
