NEW DELHI: “Your film would have run if your hero had not slept through the night. If your hero slept, why are you blaming me... why are you making me a villain?” highways minister   said on Friday, taking a swipe at Congress’s Goa in-charge ( ) for the party’s failure to form government in the state after the recent assembly elections.

 His remarks came in   in response to Congress member K C Venugopal’s allegation of BJP’s “anti-democratic” role in Goa.
 
 Venugopal, who otherwise praised Gadkari for doing a very good job as highways minister, raised the Goa issue during a discussion on the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill, 2016.
 
 “He (Gadkari) took a villain’s role in Goa for his party,” Venugopal said referring to the minister’s role in installing a   government in the state despite the party winning only 13 seats in the 40-member assembly.
 
 Gadkari’s response was directed at Digvijaya Singh who was the Congress’s Goa in-charge. During the debate, Congress members and other opposition MPs including TMC’s Dinesh Trivedi complimented Gadkari for his performance as the country’s highways minister.
 
 Congress member   too praised Gadkari but pointed to empty treasury benches, suggesting that there was perhaps not much appreciation for the minister’s work within his party. “He is performing well. He has extended roads, highways etc but see the support. 
 
 No members are there, there is no quorum. This is the mentality of our people. What is to be done? Why should we discuss?” Kharge said.
 
 Participating in the debate, Venugopal called some provisions of the bill “very very good” and said all roads in the country should be brought under the new law.
 
 He also suggested incorporation of certain provisions in the bill like ensuring parking space for heavy vehicles and to bring doctors and nurses to treat accident victims under the ambit of the Good Samaritan law.
