Ahmedabad: “Early Intervention, acceptance and awareness, are the keywords that parents and the society need to understand and implement for better results”, said Dr Nina Vaidya, a paediatrician and a teenage counsellor, at a special workshop on Saturday for teens and adults with Down syndrome. 

 The workshop was focused on effective management of the behavioural issues with special emphasis on sexuality with an aim to create awareness about the genetic disorder. It was organized by the Down Syndrome Welfare Club and conducted by eminent experts Dr Nina Vaidya and Dr Iti Shukla, a clinical psychologist in Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad.
 
 Children affected with Down syndrome undergo the same physical transformation as a normal adolescent does hence it becomes important to address their urge for physical intimacy. Their inability to express and lack of understanding on part of the parents and society often push them into depression.
 
 “We are trying to reach out to parents as early intervention is very important and most parents waste these years in search of a miracle. Down syndrome is a condition and not a disease and it can be addressed through constant training”, says Dr Vaidya.
