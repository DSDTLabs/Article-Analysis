MYSURU: A   committed suicide by consuming tablets at their house in Yadavagiri in the wee hours of Thursday. While the man died on spot, his wife died at government-run KR Hospital in the afternoon. 

 Police has identified the couple – Raju, a gardener, and Latha, a domestic help. The incident came to light after Latha alerted police through their relative about the suicide pact. Latha, unable to bear stomach ache after consuming a tablet, telephoned her aunt in KR Nagar and informed her about the incident. Her aunt in turn contacted city police through the control room. 
 
 VV Puram police inspector C V Ravi told TOI: “We rushed a team to the spot soon after being alerted. After finding the 30-year-old woman writhing in pain, the team rushed her to hospital. Raju was found dead at the house.” The couple had left their children – two daughters and a son -- at a relative’s house in the city on Wednesday evening.
 
 Before dying, Latha told police that they were disturbed after one of her woman employers threatened to lodge a police   for the   of a gold   that went missing from her house three years ago. She was recently sent to judicial custody for the theft of valuables from the house of another employer. Latha was booked for theft after police found the valuables at her house.
 
 After Latha was released on bail recently, the woman employer suspected her for the missing of the necklace. “Though she had not lodged any complaint in this regard, the employer started threatening her with a complaint if she does not return their valuable,” the inspector stated.
 
 The duo consumed the tablets used to keep pests away from ornamental plants. Latha hails from KR Nagar, while Raju is a native of Nanjangud. Both had tied the knot 14 years ago.
