NEW DELHI: An effort to eliminate diversion of kerosene to the black market and reduce pollution ended up ensuring the estrangement of fishing communities like the one in   and cost 
  

 A national green tribunal order that banned coastal sand-mining generated intense resentment as costs of building materials went up and failure of the state government was held out as a black mark against the  , costing the party more seats.
 
 Local revolts added up and reduced BJP’s winning margin, more than any wider pattern of urban-rural divides, the party’s internal assessments have concluded.
 
 The weaknesses were finally overcome by determined mobilisation and PM Narendra Modi’s campaign but point to a slack in governance after   moved to Delhi.
 
 The party is now gearing up to repairing the damage in the months leading to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and ensuring swifter government responses. In the fishing community case, the engines used on boats ran on a kerosene mix and while the fuel was withdrawn, the scheme for replacement diesel sets did not roll out in time.
 
 In the case of unhappiness of farmers over minimum support prices, the problem is seen as one of plenty as BJP functionaries point out that agriculturists are not complaining of debt. The higher production arrived at markets when the code of conduct for election had been enforced, tying the state government’s hands.
 
 The farm issue will need closer attention, admitted BJP leaders, who feel that expectations have risen despite strong support such as cheap power and credit at low interest rates.
 
 Another factor that BJP leaders are examining is the waning appeal of the party seniors in the state as there was a discernible preference among voters for younger faces in the polls.
 
 The older brigade in the party added to the incumbency of five terms in office and also blocked or slowed down the emergence of a new rank of leaders.
