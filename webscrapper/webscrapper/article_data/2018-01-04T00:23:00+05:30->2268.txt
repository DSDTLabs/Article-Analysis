Trichy: After failing in their efforts to curtail use of banned plastics in the city, authorities in Trichy have decided to try violators with iron fist by imposing penalty.

 But some of the educational institutions in the city have managed to remain plastic free including schools by strictly saying no to plastics.
 
 From January 26, traders should pursue alternative solutions to replace banned carry bags below 50 microns. Traders found violating the ban would face heavy penalties and even cancellation of license.
 
 Many of the city colleges St Joseph’s, Bishop Heber, Holy Cross, Srimad Andavar College turned into plastic free zones several years ago by fully curtailing its usage in the campus.
 
 The city-based environment organisations have also played a pivotal role in educating school and college children to sustain the momentum while some of the colleges are still struggling to fully avoid its usage during festivals and functions.
 
 Youth Exnora International, a voluntary organisation was instrumental in educating students from many colleges. Many other organisations like Thaneer contributed in the recent years in spreading the message.
 
 Founder of Youth Exnora International, P Mohan said that Ayyappan temple management was perhaps the first organisation in the city to be declared plastic free zone. Not leaving it with mere declaration, they could sustain it quite well all these years which was also an inspiration for us to take forward the message to students in schools and colleges,” he said.
 
 “It is indeed a challenging task to keep plastics away from the campus especially the banned plastics,” said principal of St Joseph’s College (SJC) Trichy, S Andrew. Half of the work was done by declaring canteens a plastic free zone. “But we still struggle to get rid of the flex banner that crop up often during events and festivals. However, we keep an eye on such things and ensure that they are removed at the earliest, “he said.
