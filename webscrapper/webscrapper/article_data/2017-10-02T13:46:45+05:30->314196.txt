BATHINDA: With prices of raw cotton hovering close to the   (MSP), the   (CCI), the state owned agency engaged in procurement of the crop, has not yet decided to start the procurement process in the state.

 The CCI makes the purchase of cotton through an online portal ‘national agriculture market’ (eNAM). As the Punjab government has not started the   process, the CCI’s Punjab branch has written a letter to the higher authorities for an approval to make purchase in Punjab without eNAM. However, in Haryana the eNAM process has started. Apart from it, the CCI also want to make purchases directly without any middleman whereas in Punjab as like other crops, the cotton is purchased through commission agents. This factor, as per sources, is also deterring the CCI from making purchases.
 
 Bathinda’s CCI branch manager Brajesh Kasana while speaking to TOI said that, “The CCI now makes purchases thorough eNAM but as Punjab has not registered with it we have written to higher authorities to give approval for making purchases without eNAM”. We are also taking it tough to make direct purchases as in Punjab there is wide network of commission agents and all purchases are made through them whereas we want to make direct purchases from farmers for their benefit and we are trying to resolve this issue as well.
 
 Punjab marketing board secretary Amit Dhaka when contacted said Punjab government has already given its consent to adopt the eNAM. Our proposal is pending with the union government. We had a meeting with officials of the union government and the CCI and soon all the district mandis will be linked with eNAM”.
