In the latest episode of  , everyone is seen shouting at   for driving away the vegetable vendor. He apologises and then the men decide to call up Abdul about the same.

 He tells them that there is a bungalow nearby which is always locked since the owner lives in America. He asks them to pluck lemons from that bungalow's garden. 
 
 Bhide says they should not steal lemons but   and Sodhi say they will have to get lemons to drink soda.
 
 Jethalal suggests that they should make a lemon bank with Abdul. 
 
 They finally reach the bungalow where the lemon tree is. Sodhi finally locates the tree and they all debate over the fact that who will go inside the bungalow to get lemons. 
 
 Bhide says it is wrong to go inside anyone's property without the owner's permission. And Dr Hathi seconds that.
 
 Mehta then suggests that if they jump the wall to get lemons then it will be stealing but if they keep the money there then it will not be stealing. 
 
 All of them get inside the bungalow to get the lemons while Dr Hathi waits outside. But a passerby calls Mumbai police and inform them about seeing a group of men breaking into a bungalow.
 
 Anjali calls Taarak asking about his whereabouts. Sodhi picks up Popatlal and they pluck 8 lemons and keep the money on the spot to make up for the forced entry. 
 
  
 Taarak keeps Rs 50 for the owner and then Bhide argues with him that they should only keep Rs 23 but Mehta decides to leave Rs 30. Bhide says they should leave a note for the owner.
 
 Police reaches the spot and they find Dr Hathi standing outside the bungalow. They say that the thieves will be arrested soon.
