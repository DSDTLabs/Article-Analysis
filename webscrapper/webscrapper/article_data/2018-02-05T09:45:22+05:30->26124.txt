HUBBALLI: Will non-executive chairman of Infosys and former UIDAI chairman Nandan Nilekani contest again? 

 Wife and philanthropist Rohini Nilekani hinted at this, saying "good people like Nandan have to keep trying to come into politics". The comment was made in the presence of Nilekani himself, at an 'Evening with Legends' session, held as part of the Development Dialogue by   on the Infosys campus here on Saturday evening.
 
 After successfully heading the Aadhaar authority that issued biometric identity to over 1 billion people, and unsuccessfully contesting the   polls from Bengaluru South in 2014, Nilekani kept many people guessing about his next venture. In the meantime, he was back to lead crisis-hit Infosys again.
 
 With assembly polls coming up, and Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Rohini's comments have led to much speculation whether Nilekani will contest.
 
 Replying to a query of Gururaj 'Desh' Deshpande, president and chairman of   and chairman of Tejas Networks, Nilekani said he has failed many times. "I failed in politics. I lost the election," Nilekani said. "I'm glad I lost the election. I dodged a bullet," he quipped. However, he did not explain why he is glad. 
 
 Sharing his experiences during the election campaign, Nilekani said it translated into three months of heavy activity. "There were multiple events from dawn to dusk, and it was quite tough. One should experience it. You learn about life and people," he said.
