CHANDIGARH: A team of representatives of 10 nationalised banks on Friday sealed nine industrial complexes of a rice and pulses export company in Rai industrial area of   as the firm had defaulted in repayment of around Rs 648.43 crore. The team was headed by State Bank of India’s Karol Bagh branch chief manager Shalini Sharma and accompanied by Sonipat deputy commissioner Hawa Singh.

 Banke Behari Exports, a company owned by Amar Chand Gupta, Ram Lal Gupta and Raj Kumar Gupta, residents of New Delhi and Sonipat, had five factories on nine plots of Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) Complex in Rai. The company stopped operations after demonetisation and the owners went into hiding.
 
 Banks initiated proceedings in the court of the Sonipat DC to recover dues and the premises were sealed as company directors did not respond to notices served two months ago. Bankers also pasted notices outside the plots saying the properties were attached with the banks and would be released only after repayment of debt. 
 
 The executive magistrate who supervised the proceedings, said the premises were sealed on the orders of the Sonipat DC while disposing of the complaint moved by bankers. “We completed the proceedings within two hours. The proceedings were videographed. We will submit a compliance report to the DC on Monday,” he said.
