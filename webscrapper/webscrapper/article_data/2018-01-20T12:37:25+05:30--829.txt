BENGALURU:  , commandant,   on Saturday said that the   will write to Chief Minister   about the repeated fires at   lake.

 Pointing out that the civic authorities are answerable for the fires being caused at the lake, which is in close proximity to the defence area, Gupta said: “We will certainly make a case and write to the Chief Minister. This is not the first time this is happening, it happened in February last year, and in 2016 and 2015 as well.”
 
 He said that more than 5,000 personnel at the   were pressed into service on Friday and that many of them worked through the night to keep the fire under control.
 
 “At any given point about 800 people were on the spot, while the remaining were preparing so that they could get into action when the team on the spot returned for reinforcement,” he said, adding that the civil fire tenders also reached and helped in a combined effort.
 
 The actual cause for the fire is yet to be determined, and the personnel remained unclear, if it was caused by chemicals, or if passersby dropped a cigarette bud, but Gupta said that the sentries remained alert and informed the ASC soon as they spotted the fire.
 
 “Several places continue to simmer and we are still on high alert. It is difficult to put out fire, especially when it keeps reappearing from multiple sources, which is why it took more than 4 hours yesterday. The civil authorities need to take responsibility, even as we do whatever it takes from our end,” Gupta said.
