CHENNAI: The district consumer redressal forum has directed a water purifier manufacturer to pay a compensation of 24,500 to a customer who was sold a defective Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant by the firm three years ago. 

 
 The petitioner, C Mathusuthanan of West Mambalam had purchased the water purifier from Aqua Pure Plus on August 25, 2015, at a cost of 9,500. Within 10 days, two complaints were raised and the unit was serviced by the manufacturer. During the second servicing, the technician found a major defect in the adapter. After which the adapter, a membrane and micron filter were replaced. "The purpose of purchasing a water purifier was defeated," Mathusuthanan stated in his complaint. Subsequently, three more service requests were raised in the next five months, by when the water stopped flowing. Mathusuthanan purchased another purifier in April 2016. 
 
 In their counter, the manufacturer claimed the adapter was not covered under warranty and that the defect with respect to the adapter was liable to be dismissed. 
 
 The forum bench ruling in favour of the petitioner said, "After servicing five times the company was unable to rectify the defects in the product. This establishes that the product had an inherent manufacturing defect." Apart from directing the company to refund the cost of the product, it also slapped a fine of 10,000 for deficiency in service and mental agony, and 5,000 toward litigation expenses.
