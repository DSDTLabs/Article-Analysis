Nagercoil: Criticising the state ministers for their contradicting statements on the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Congress whip S. Vijayadharani said that all ministers including former chief minister O. Panneerselvam should resign their posts on moral grounds and extend cooperation to a full-fledged probe into the highly controversial issue.

 “As demanded by various political parties, only a CBI probe can unearth the truth behind the death of Ms Jayalalithaa. They (ministers) have been making contradicting statements only to protect their positions. They are making such statements to again protect themselves from the intra-party confusions,” the MLA told reporters here on Wednesday.
 
 Welcoming the Madras high court direction asking the government not to bring school students to the MGR centenary celebrations organised by it across the state, she added that it was not right to harass students by making them wait in the sun for hours. Vijayadharani criticised the state government for organising the celebrations as a party event. TNN
