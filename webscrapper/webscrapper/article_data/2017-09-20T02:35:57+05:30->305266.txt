NAVI MUMBAI: A businessman from Mahape has lodged a complaint at   police station alleging that an Ahmedabad based finance company has cheated him to the tune of Rs 5.63 lakh under the pretext of offering him a business loan of Rs 15 lakh. Based on a complaint lodged by the victim,  , who owns a hardware company, an FIR has been registered against the MD and office executive of City Finance company and an estate agent.

 In 2014, Vaishnav had seen an advertisement of the company offering business loan and called them. He was asked to email documents. He was asked to deposit the processing fee in various bank accounts to avail the “sanctioned” loans. The firm then sent him a demand draft of Rs 7.5 lakh which turned out to be fake.
 
 After locating the firm’s officials for two years, Vaishnav filed an FIR. The accused trio are at large, said cops.
