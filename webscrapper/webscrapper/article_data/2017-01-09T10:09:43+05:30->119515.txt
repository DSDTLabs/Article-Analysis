CHENNAI: A gang which posed as police personnel and stole   jewellery from women by diverting their attention has now adopted a new modus operandi. They disguise themselves as priests and go on a stealing spree, targeting aged women.

 In three incidents at   and  , the gang members disguised as priests robbed the women of at least 10 sovereigns on Thursday.
 
 In one case, a man in saffron dress came to the house of 46-year-old   at Choolai. He said he needed the blessings of women to attain the next level. He told her that blessing him wearing jewellery would give negative results to her. Believing him, Rasika gave him 5.5 sovereigns of gold jewellery wrapped in a piece of paper. He took her blessings, and handed over the paper parcel. After he left, Rasika opened it and was shocked to see pebbles and sand inside. Near Periamet, the gang members targeted 73-year-old Premavathy who was walking alone. They sought her blessings in a similar manner and made away with five sovereigns gold jewellery.
 
 In another case,   from Periamet was robbed of her five sovereign gold jewellery.
 
 All the three complainants said they were cheated in the same manner. “Though the trick seems to be unbelievable, the gullible still fall prey to such things,“ said a police officer.
 
 “Since we have created awareness about old tricks, they now seemed to have adopted new ways to cheat people,“ he added.
