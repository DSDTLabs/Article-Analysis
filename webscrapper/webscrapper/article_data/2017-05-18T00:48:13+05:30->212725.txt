New Delhi: Acting on a TOI report, the Union water resources ministry on Wednesday directed the health department of the city government to set up an expert committee to conduct a detailed study on the health impact of the   operating in the   locality of northeast Delhi and extent of ground water contamination in the area, if any, due to these industrial units.

 Expecting the committee to submit its report within a month for proper action against those units, the ministry said any violation of the direction would attract coercive action under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. 
 
 The TOI on Wednesday reported about discharge of carcinogenic chemicals by cloth dyeing units and how the untreated effluents are contaminating ground water which is the main source of drinking water in the area. 
 
 "The expert committee, led by department of heath of Delhi government, will have representatives of state unit of the  , Delhi Pollution Control Board and department of industries of the Delhi government as members", said an office order of the ministry. 
 
 The direction to the Delhi government was issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act which empowers the Central Ground Water Board to take action against officials if they don't comply with its order. The secretary of the health department will have to comply with the direction, issued by the chairman of the Central Ground Water Authory, Akhil Kumar. 
 
 Flagging the issue, the TOI reported that the residents of the locality depend on borewells and it is quite likely that the acids, dyes and untreated effluents discharged into the drain eventually seep into the ground water. Even the local MLA voiced his concern on the issue and said he would raise it in the Delhi assembly.
