LUDHIANA: The   became a scene of violent bustle and commotion on Saturday after the   and   high court stayed the orders of   that restrained highway authorities from collecting the fee.

 Expressing ignorance about the stay, a number of commuters refused to pay the charge. As tempers frayed, commuters reportedly came to blows with the plaza staff and damaged the tollbooth property. 
 
 Dinesh Kumar Vats, deputy plaza manager, Panipat Jalandhar NH-1 Tollway Private Limited, which manages the toll, said, “Despite the stay ordered by the high court, most of the commuters declined to pay the toll and misbehaved with the staff. Some of them crashed past our boom barriers. We had to seek police help to control the situation.”
 
 Lok Insaaf Party supremo and Ludhiana MLA Simarjit Singh Bains, who since Wednesday has been protesting against the toll collection at Ladhowal, slammed the state government. “Ministers and officials of the state government are hand in glove with the toll mafia. Had this not been the case, the government would have sent its advocate general to the high court against the appeal of the toll company.”
