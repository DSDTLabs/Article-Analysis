CHANDIGARH: A lecture by Prof Apoorvanand of   at PU’s sociology department was interrupted by   members in the question-answer session. As he was speaking on “The last battle of Gandhi”, ABVP members asked him why he described JNU student Umar Khalid as his son in an article he wrote for an English daily.

 During the question-answer session at 4:30pm, Dinesh Chauhan of ABVP asked the professor, “how can an anti-national like Umar Khalid be your son?” Apoorvanand replied that there is no proof of him being anti-national. Meanwhile, ABVP members started raising slogans of “Bharat Mata ki Jai.” Prof Apoorvanand told the ABVP members that since the discussion was over, they could kill him. ABVP members replied that they were not there to kill anyone and didn’t want to make him a hero.
 
 “It was an interactive discussion and we were there to ask questions. We were just asking questions and nothing else and we did not go with an intention to harm anybody because it is our University. We just asked him when he can say Umar Khalid is his son, why can’t he say Hanumanthappa is his son?,” said Sourabh Kapoor, state secretary of ABVP, Punjab. Since Apoorvanand talked about how Gandhi’s murder was plannedin a room, the next question hurled at him was where Bhagat Singh’s killing was plotted. Police intervened but ABVP members said they would not do anything and were just asking questions. The argument continued for around 25 minutes.
 
  professors are rankled at the episode. “I have always believed that in a University, opinions may differ and differ vastly but then, here the opinions should be respected. It is one thing to say that I don’t agree with you but it’s another thing to say that I won’t let you speak ,” said   Brar, a professor at the political science department of PU.
