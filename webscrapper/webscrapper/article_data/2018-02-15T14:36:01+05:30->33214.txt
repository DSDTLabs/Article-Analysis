Panaji: Goa Forward Party on Wednesday said that it would ensure that a statue of Dr Jack   was erected in the Goa assembly complex, but that it was willing to wait till the next state elections. Reacting to reports that speaker Pramod Sawant had set aside resolutions in favour of the statue, GFP spokesperson Trajano D’Mello said that there are other means to erect statues. 

 “Nothing has officially been declared yet,” he said. “Let it come up on the floor of the house. Let us see what emerges.” 
 
 D’Mello also said that his party would listen to suggestions from different stakeholders, and would also engage with every person to ensure that the statue was erected. “We are in power for five years,” D’Mello said. “The party is willing to wait for the assembly elections.” 
 
 D’Mello also dismissed allegations by   leader Girish Chodankar that GFP had compromised on the issue in exchange for chairmanship of the Greater   Planning and Development Authority. “The Congress was in power for over a decade but never remembered or thought of honouring Sequeira, leave aside erecting his statue,” D’Mello said.
 
 Goa Forward also slammed its coalition partner, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) for creating confusion around the issue. “(These are) people who have brought in the resolution for statues of Ram Manohar Lohia and Shivaji,” he said. “What right do they have to bring in such a resolution? Their party was trying to merge Goa with Maharashtra.”
