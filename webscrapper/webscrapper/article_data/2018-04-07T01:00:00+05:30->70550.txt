There was a time when films were shot in multiple schedules, sometimes, even stretching over years. However, the scenario has changed today, and if you ask the actors, they’d tell you that it’s a change for the better. Earlier, they would work on four-five films simultaneously, but now, the profession demands more focus and it’s just one project at a time. 

 Taapsee Pannu, who recently completed work on two films — Anubhav Sinha’s '
 ' and Shaad Ali’s '
 ' — in a span of less than three months, says, “It helps when a film is completed in a short span, because I can snap out of the character for good. When films have long and multiple schedules, getting into the skin of the character after long gaps can get tiring for actors. It takes time to get into a character and sometimes, you even end up carrying it to your next film. It takes time to shed the nuances of one role and fit into another.” 
 
 She’s glad that modern movie schedules are designed to accommodate such factors. She reveals, “I finished ' ' in 27 days, start to finish. We shot for ' ' in three locations, including Punjab, Haryana and Serbia, yet we wrapped it up between mid-November and December. '
 ' will also be wrapped up in two months flat.”
 
 We are sure moviegoers, too, will appreciate this new way of filmmaking, as it means more films in lesser time!
