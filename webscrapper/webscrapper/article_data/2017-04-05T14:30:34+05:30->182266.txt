ROHTAK: With accused in the double   of Chautala village in Sirsa district still at large, villagers on Monday gheraoed the local police chowki and threatened to show black flags to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during his visit to the area. Khattar is scheduled to visit Sirsa on April 8.

 Two Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) workers   and   associated with Pardeep Godara, a close aide of Abhay Singh Chautala, were gunned down by some unidentified assailants at the kinnow waxing plant near Chautala on January 11. Protesters sat outside the police chowki and declared that they would not send their children to school for three days as a mark of their protest for the delay in arrest of the guilty.
 
 Congress leader K V Singh, who also hails from Chautala, alleged that even after three months since the double murder police had failed to make any progress in the case. He said on March 11, police had sought some time to solve the case after villagers protested. However, nothing had been done so far, he claimed.
 
 Former sarpanch of Chautala Krishan Bishnoi said police had mentioned the three names for murder conspiracy but residents suspect the role of more persons behind the episode. The protesters also demanded security for the victims’ family members.
 
 Ravinder Poonia, brother of deceased Satbir, said they had formed a 70-member committee and it had been decided that no family would send their children to the   for next three days.
 
 “If police fail to make some substantial progress till April 7, we would meet the CM Khattar on April 8. We would also show him black flags,” said Ravinder. The protesters also demanded the case to be probed by CBI and formed a committee to take up the issue before authorities.
 
 Sirsa Sadar police station in charge Vinod Kajla said they were making efforts to arrest the main accused, notorious criminal Chottu Bhat, and the shooters accompanying him by raiding their probable hideouts.
