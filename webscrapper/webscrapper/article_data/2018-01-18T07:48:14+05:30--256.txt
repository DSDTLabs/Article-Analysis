AURANGABAD: In a huge embarrassment for the   ( ), the hall tickets prepared for staffers giving a departmental examination in different centres across the state on Wednesday were found to have a common birth date for the aspirants - October 10, 1990.

 The examination was conducted to fill the Class III posts of clerk-cum-typist across all divisions of the MSRTC. As many as 434 employees took the online test in four designated centres in   district alone.
 
 When contacted, Mumbai-based MSRTC general manager (personnel)   admitted to the goof-up, but said the examination was nonetheless conducted. "We allowed the candidates to take the test on the basis of their MSRTC identity cards and other conventional identity proofs. We will find out what went wrong," he said. 
 
 Kale did not have information about the total number of candidates who gave the examination in the state. The number is believed to be large considering that the examination was held in 21 districts.
 
 A division-level MSRTC official said time constraints resulted in the error on the hall tickets. “Once it was realised that we could not use the hall tickets with the same date of birth, our headquarter-based authorities asked for another system to be put in place. Accordingly, we were asked to allow the candidate to sit for the examination after verifying his application ID and proof of identity,” he said. The 90-marks examination was held in two sessions — from 10 am to 11.30 am and from 3pm to 4.30 pm.
 
 Suresh Jadhav, leader of the employees’ union associated with the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), said mistakes in hall tickets was a major lapse. “The top management has reduced the MSRTC to a laughing stock over time. Strict action must be taken against those guilty, including top officials,” he said.
