 has been roped in to   the upcoming dance  , ' '. The show will not see celebrity participation but regular people dancing in jodis. This will include mother-daughter, father-son, husband-wife and teacher-student jodis among others, who are ready not just to take up the dancing challenge but to also prove their relationship dynamics.

 Lara says, “I am a family person and relationships hold a lot of importance in my life. I personally believe that when you attempt something with your loved one, you are bound to succeed. When I was approached for this show, I knew that I had to be a part of it because I could resonate with the concept. While I love dancing and I am trained in certain forms, I can tell you that I dance better with my daughter because we dance like there is no one watching us. That’s what I will be judging the contestants on — the beauty and 'tevar' of their relationship translating into their performance.”
