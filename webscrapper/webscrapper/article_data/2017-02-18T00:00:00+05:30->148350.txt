  While Tovino confirms that he is doing the film, he remains tight-lipped about the details, saying, “I am not at liberty to reveal anything about it till those behind the movie make the official announcement.”

 The movie’s director Vijayalakshmi had cranked the camera for several Tamil hits including Chinna Veedu and had also written the script for the Malayalam movie Daddy, which had Arvind Swamy in the lead. When we contacted her, the filmmaker wasn’t ready to reveal the details of the movie.
  However, a source from the production unit tells us that it’s a love story. “The film is based on a true incident that happened in Brazil. It’s an unusual love story and Tovino plays an intense character in the movie,” says the source, adding that the film also has a stellar cast apart from the actor.
 
  We hear that the movie’s shoot, which is currently on in Chennai, will be wrapped up by the end of this month and the film will hit theatres by mid-2017.
