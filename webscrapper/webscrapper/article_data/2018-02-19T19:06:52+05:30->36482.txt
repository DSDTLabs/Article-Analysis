AHMEDABAD: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was marching ahead in the Gujarat municipal polls as the   was under way on Monday. According to the state election commissioner, out of 75 muncipalities, the BJP has won 47, Congress 16, NCP 1, BSP 1 and independents 4, while in six constituencies, results were awaited. 

 
 The results will be declared for 75 Nagar Palikas (municipalities), two district panchayats, 17 talukas and 1400 village panchayats for which polls were held on Saturday. 
 
 Of 75 municipalities, BJP is in power in 47. Of the 17 taluka panchayats where elections were held, BJP is in power in 13. The two district panchayats going to the polls, Banaskantha and Kheda, are both with the BJP. Congress had won the last elections their elected members defected to the BJP, and the saffron party took control.
 
 Though gram panchayat (village panchayat) elections are not fought on party symbols, most gram panchayat have BJP-inclined sarpanches. Hence, to retain power in all these bodies and win more local bodies will be a big challenge for the party.
