PATNA:   geology teacher and JD(U) MLC   on Wednesday blamed   in West Bengal for heavy siltation in the lower reaches of the Ganga. He criticised BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi’s statements in favour of Farakka barrage as misleading. 

 Nandan said the barrage causes estimated over 20 lakh tonnes of silt per annum and diverts the flow of the Ganga water, resulting in the rise of its riverbed and floods in the state.
 
 Nandan said heavy siltation in the Ganga has considerably reduced its water carrying capacity in recent years. Other tributaries are also not able to discharge water properly into the Ganga, leading to further siltation at their mouth. All this causes deformity in the entire river network in Bihar, he said.
 
 The JD(U) functionary said recent studies showed that the average depth of the Ganga has reduced by almost 50 per cent from Patna to Farakka in Murshidabad district — a waterway distance of 460km downstream — in the four decades since the construction of the barrage. 
 
 The studies of satellite imageries carried out in 15 years show enhanced rate of silt deposits every year, indicating the severity of floods in future. Technical analysis of the river course also suggests that any obstruction in the main Ganga plays a catalytic role for accentuating the recurrence of floods. Therefore, the only required immediate action is decommissioning of Farakka barrage as has been suggested by chief minister Nitish Kumar, he said. 
 
 Nandan also said Modi should not create any political conflict on this issue without knowing the technical facts.
