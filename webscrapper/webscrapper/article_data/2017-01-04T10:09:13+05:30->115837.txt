Dev tells Ishwari that he knew about Sona's infertility issue before marriage and even she got to know about it yesterday. Ishwari is shocked. She tells him to go back to his wife and leave her alone.
 
  At Sona's house, Bejoy is furious about everything. Asha tries to explain him and tries to calm him down.
  
  Dev convinces Ishwari to come back with him. She tells him that she will come back home on one condition. She continues saying that if there are 7% chances of Sona to conceive then she should get treatments done and try their best. But she will have to agree to this.
  
  Dev rushes back home and tells Sonakshi the condition put by Ishwari. Sona gets upset. She tells him that she will be ready for all treatments but if still she is not able to get pregnant, will Ishwari accept her as the daughter-in-law.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  Dev goes to the temple and brings back Ishwari. She expects Sona to be around but Sona has already left for her parent's house.
  
  Sona's family is talking to her when Sourav comes and starts taking Dev's side. Out of anger Bejoy says that he is doing this because Dev gave him Rs. 5 crore for his business.
  
  Sona is shocked to hear this as she had no idea.
