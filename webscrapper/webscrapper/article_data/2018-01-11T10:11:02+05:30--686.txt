RAJKOT: A day after a   near Savarkundla, a   was found dead in a well in Sarkadia village of Amreliâ€™s Khambha taluka on Wednesday.

 The lion carcass was spotted by the villagers who informed the forest department. Earlier on Friday last week, a lioness had died after falling into an open well in   near Veraval. It is suspected that the lion fell into the well while chasing a prey. The death of three lions in less than week has angered the locals and wildlife conservationists who blame the forest department for negligence.
