BENGALURU:
 

 Eshwarappa is fixated on the idea of the Sangolli Rayanna Brigade and its state-level convention scheduled to be held at   on January 26. We have drawn the attention of party   to this at the just-concluded state executive committee meeting at Kalaburagi, and he will take a call on how to deal with it.

 There is not an iota of truth in this. I am taking decisions in consultation with all (district units) concerned and this can be seen in the manner in which district units of the party were recast in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi.The notion of me taking unilateral decisions is a creation of the media, and there is no truth in it.
 
 
 
 
 He will be part of the teams that will fan out across Karnataka in the second phase of assessment, once the budget session of the state legislature is over.

 National party president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have given us a clear mission. The party will discuss all issues (that are seen as potentially dangerous to this mission) internally and resolve them to achieve it. I have no individual prestige and am committed to delivering what the national leadership wants from the state unit. e The BJP seems to be no different from the Congress o when it comes to seeking supremacy and establishing control over it... We are bound by the Mission 150 given to us and will ensure that we deliver.
