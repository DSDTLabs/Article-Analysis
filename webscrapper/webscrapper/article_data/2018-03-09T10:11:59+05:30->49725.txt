NEW DELHI: On Friday, the equity markets witnessed a volatile spell in initial trading, followed by which, the benchmark indices seem to have settled in the green.

 30-share BSE   opened with a jump of 114.48 points at 33,465.05 but soon plunged into the red. At 9.50 am however, the index was up 103 points. The broader 50-share NSE   followed a similar pattern of trading and was up quarter a per cent.
 
 Yesterday, the markets had snapped a six-day losing streak with the BSE index closing with a jump of more than 300 points, the biggest single-day gain since February 23. The Street has been under pressure due to weak global cues in the wake of trade war fears and the murky state of affairs in the banking sector closer home.
 
 In Friday's early trading, the PSU bank sub-index was once again down almost a per cent but all other sectoral sub-indices were trading in the green with Nifty Pharma leading the rally.
