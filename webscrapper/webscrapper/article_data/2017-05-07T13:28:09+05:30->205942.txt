BARWANI: With their willingness to join mainstream of life, around 1000 Sikligar community’s youth, who are involved in illegal  , are likely to surrender with their weapons before police and administrative officials   to be held at Betma on May 13. 

 Several people of Sikligar community led by its president   submitted a memorandum to Barwani superintendent of police Prashant Khare on Saturday and told him that the community youths involved in illegal manufacturing and smuggling of weapons want to join mainstream. 
 
 “The youths are involved in the crime due to unemployment and negligence of government. They need a push to indulge their skills in tools manufacturing,” they told the SP. 
 
 The community members said that the Sikligar community people are basically revolutionists. They are involved in manufacturing quality arms for almost three centuries. “The mahapanchayat will be organised to discuss various issues like unemployment, defamation due to   construction etc. More than 10,000 Sikligar community people from several places will attend the mahapanchayat. Also, more than 1,000 people involved in illegal business will surrender if they will get rehabilitation package from the government,” said the community members.
 
 As per sources, SPs of the districts, where Sikligar community has its influence, have also been invited in the mahapanchayat. “It is up to Sikligars that how they coordinate with government schemes for their community’s welfare and progress. They should involve their youths in proper education and employment,” SP Khare told TOI
 
 Administration has made efforts to develop Sikligar community people for two decades in Barwani and Khargone districts. But it proved futile because it was unable to provide employment opportunities for the youths. In last 11 years police have registered 92 cases against them in Barwani district.
