LUCKNOW: To ensure its relevance in the state,   has directed all district units to ensure continuous engagement with people on local issues and to take up relevant matters like farmers' distress with the administration on war footing. 

 With just about a year left for the 2019   elections, the party's preparation has started with organization-building in UP. UPCC president   will hold a series of meetings at the divisional level with party workers from the end of this month. 
 
 "He will hold the first meeting in   on January 28. The idea is to meet with workers on the ground and understand reality of each area," said the party's UP spokesperson  .
 
 Directions have also been given to the party's 33 departments and frontal organisations to hold meetings in the first week of each month. 
 
 "  needs to compete with parties that are strong on the ground...BJP and SP are cadre-based parties. Every once in a while, a senior party leader will meet workers and communicate the party's strategy to them," said a senior party member.
 
 District units have also been told to take up local issues even if there are no directions from the central leadership.
 
 "Our information is that people are upset with the BJP in both the state and at the Centre. Our workers will reach out to them with the Congress's achievements," said a party source.
