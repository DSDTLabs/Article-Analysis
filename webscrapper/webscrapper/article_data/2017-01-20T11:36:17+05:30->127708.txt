KOLHAPUR: Over 2,000 primary and secondary schools in the city and district will be closed on Friday following a   associations to press their demands.

 The strike has gathered the support of the district education forum too. 
 
 “Despite assurances by the state government, our demands have not been addressed for many years. The government’s lethargic approach has forced us to go on a day-long agitation on Friday,” a member of the teachers’ association said. 
 
 The teachers of private and municipal schools and Kolhapur zilla parishad have also announced active support for Friday’s agitation. 
 
 A member of the teachers’ association said that the strike is the second phase of the agitation. On Wednesday, all the teachers had expressed their displeasure by sporting black ribbons to work.
 
 An office bearer of the Kolhapur district educational forum said, “Chief minister   had recently assured to resolve all the issues of the state government employees, but, unfortunately there was no mention about the government’s stand on teachers’ problems.

The major demands raised by the teachers’ association include revoking the stay on teachers’ recruitments, cancelling the notification issued to dissolve the education department in the revenue department and resolving issues pertaining to salaries of contract teachers.
