Chennai: This weekend, some of the country’s most patient men will gather on the shores of Kovalam for what could perhaps be described as one of the most still competitions ever to be held in the city.

 On January 20 and 21, the All India Game Fishing Association will host 100 anglers from across the country – from as far as Kashmir to as close as Koyambedu – in its first ever angling competition.
 
 “The idea is to promote sustainable sports fishing,” says Prasanna T, one of the organisers. “This is the first of its kind in TN. And we’re planning it as an annual event,” adds the 36-year-old, who started fishing when he was in school.
 
 The competition, says veteran angler Robert Gagarin, is all about ‘catch and release’, where fish caught is measured and immediately released. “We want to showcase this technique to the local fishermen because sometimes the fishing can be indiscriminate and disturb the ecosystem,” says the 64-year-old businessman, who does yearly jaunts to the Andamans to fish.
 
 “We are also giving every angler circle hooks, which do not harm the fish,” he says. 
 
 The avid anglers will be positioned around 20 feet from each other, along the shore from 6 am to 6 pm, so they can catch the four changing tides of the day.
 
 Recent game fishing competition prize-winner Vicky T has been practising hard for the last couple of weeks. “The surf at Kovalam has been aggressive but we’ve caught and released quite a number of fish. The waters have calmed down now,” says the 30-year-old TCS employee.
 
 As for the bit about patience, well, the saying among anglers, says Prasanna, is that if you’re looking for a patient partner for life, marry an angler. 
 
 “You cannot angle unless you master the art of patience, of sitting still for hours. Fishing is a form of meditation, you forget the whole world. I would say most anglers cast their worries out along with their bait,” says Prasanna.
