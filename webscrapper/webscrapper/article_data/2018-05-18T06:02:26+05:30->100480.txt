CHENNAI: With two recent accidents bringing safety in malls — or the lack of it — under the scanner, the Chennai district administration has given these commercial centres a two-week   to obtain a licence under the public buildings act. 

 While a 10-year-old boy died in April after his school bag snagged in the moving handrail of an escalator at the Express Avenue mall, throwing him off the second floor, a 23-year-old was injured when he jumped off the fourth floor at the Forum   last week.
 
 During a review meeting on safety in public buildings here on Thursday, district collector   told representatives of shopping malls and cinema halls to apply for the licence within the next two weeks. Officials said schools, colleges, hostels, libraries, clubs, lodging houses, boarding houses, hotels and buildings used for organising public meetings, marriages and parties must apply for the licence under the   (Licensing) Act, 1965.
 
 Noting that the act deals with safety norms in such public buildings, an official said several shopping malls in the city are ignorant of this requirement. “Many believe the structural stability certificate issued by the public works department is enough. But it is also mandatory to obtain this licence issued by the revenue divisional officer ( ) attached to the collectorate,” an official said. Running a public building without the licence would attract penal action including a jail term of six months for the owner, he added. The absence of such licences indicates that RDOs have not conducted inspections to verify if malls have obtained them. 
 
 Seven malls in the city have features such as multiplexes; there are also 10 large centres with outlets selling consumer goods.
