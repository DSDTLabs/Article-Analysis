MUMBAI: Municipal commissioner   on Thursday appeared before the Bombay high court and said he would verify the claims concerning cracks in the 130-year-old Bhatia Society on Princess Street. The high court then directed the   to also ascertain whether the cracks were being caused by ongoing redevelopment work in a plot behind Bhatia Society and to file an affidavit. 

 On May 22, Justice S J Kathawalla had summoned the BMC chief to court after civic officers failed to give a satisfactory explanation as to why the redevelopment work was not stopped. 
 
 On March 16, the tenants of Bhatia Society, including   (82), moved HC against   and three other landlords as well as the Mumbai Repair Board and complained about cracks in the building, also known as Sitaram Sadan, caused by illegal digging of the floor of a vacant ground-floor flat and damage to the plinth and iron beams of the structure, putting the lives and properties of 50 tenants at risk. The HC then appointed an independent architect to inspect the building, and directed the landlord to deposit money to ensure safety of the building and undo the damage caused.
 
 But after cracks re-appeared in the structure, Postwalla again moved court. 
 
  On Thursday, former additional solicitor general Kevic Setalvad, who appeared for the BMC, submitted that all steps for rectification were taken and that a stop-work notice was issued on May 22. Justice Kathawalla said he did not enjoy calling top bureaucrats to court, but pointed out that he was getting no proper response from the BMC earlier. "It is only after the HC passed the necessary orders that officials who were enjoying their deep slumber, swung into action," said Justice Kathawalla in his order. 
 
 The HC had directed the BMC and Mhada to take swift action to ensure no further damages is caused, but adequate action was not taken. Mehta, on Thursday, said normally work cannot be stopped on redevelopment without ascertaining facts.
