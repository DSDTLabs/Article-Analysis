TRICHY: It was not the usual cakewalk for   X1 students of state board schools as they appeared for the board exams for the first time on Wednesday. Besides the added stress factor of a board  , Tamil language paper 1 also seemed to give them a taste of things to come. 

 “I found it difficult to answer the 1-mark and 3-marks questions which used to be easier to score. It was a tough paper considering the twisted questions which could have been answered only if you were thorough with the subject,” said S  , a student who appeared for the exam. Another student, S   found the paper relatively easier than what she anticipated. She said that the paper would have been tough for those who relied only on question banks. “Most of the questions were new and asked from the book. I admit that the stress factor associated with board exam cannot be ruled out, but it is also an opportunity to strengthen our basics,” he said.
 
 Speaking on the same lines, a Tamil teacher of a government school in   termed the questions carrying 1, 3 and 10 marks relatively tough. He said these were twisted unlike what students had seen so far in class 11. However, he felt that if the students understood the question and then attempted it appropriately, scoring decent marks might not be difficult.
 
 While teachers agreed that class XI board exam would help students get their basics strong, they felt that it had added burden to the headmasters and PG teachers of higher secondary schools. “Teachers spend most of their summer vacation evaluating board examination papers. Now with class 11 papers also for evaluation, they will have to give up the few free days that were left for them during the vacation,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. “The worst affected are language teachers who have to evaluate more papers than the subject teachers. They have to evaluate double the number of papers since only Tamil and English have paper 1 and 2,” said the HM.
