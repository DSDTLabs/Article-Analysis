NEW DELHI: The   plans to carry out a market study to find out ways to increase its revenue by nearly Rs 30,000 crore in the 2018-19 financial year. The move follows the railways unveiling its plan in the 2018 budget to spend around Rs 1.5 lakh crore - the highest ever - on strengthening rail network and capacity expansion to bring the national transporter back on track.

 
 Railways has been increasing capital expenditure every year for the last three years since the   government came to power, but extra-budgetary resources have become the key source of railway capex over the last few years.
 
 As gross budgetary support (funds from central budget) to railways more or less stagnated, the transporter has to mostly depend on institutional financing (such as loans mobilised from   and the  ) and monetisation of assets.
 
 A senior railway official said, "The major concern is that around Rs 93,000 crore of the total capex spending (Rs 1.5 lakh crore) will come from borrowings." Despite tall claims, the budget figures were not very encouraging as railways' gross budgetary support (GBS) which was around Rs 55,000 crore last year has been revised to Rs 40,000 crore for 2017-18. This means the transporter failed to utilise funds, raising questions over execution of projects and its capacity to take up large-scale expansion.
 
 As a result, GBS for 2018-19 is Rs 53,060 crore only. Similarly, investments through   were pegged at Rs 24,000 crore for 2017-18 (revised estimate) and projected to be Rs 27,000 crore in 2018-19. This means even the transporter is not optimistic about PPP investments in projects. As private investments are not coming, the railways' top echelon is worried and decided to go for a market study to increase revenues by Rs 30,000 crore in next fiscal.
