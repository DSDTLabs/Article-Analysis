AURANGABAD: Perturbed by alleged   by a 19-year old boy, a   girl student attempted suicide by hanging herself at her house in the city on Wednesday afternoon.

 The 15-year-old girl, who studies in Class IX at a Marathi medium girls school, was rescued by her mother, police said. The girl stated in her complaint to the   police that she wanted to end her life as she was fed up with the frequent harassment by the teenager. “I was being harassed since Diwali,” she said.
 
 “The teenager chased her school bus, stopped her on the road and went to the extent of writing “I Love You” on the wall in her classroom several times,” the complaint states.
 
 The girl said that she also brought the matter to the notice of the school staff, but no action was taken against the culprit. Her mother blamed the school staff and management for not taking cognizance of her complaint against an outsider. 
 
 The school management, however, refuted the allegations and said it was only after the police reached their premises that they learned about the harassment.
 
 Police said the girl had almost hanged herself. “The woman soon rescued her daughter and took her to the  , where she was kept under observation for a while and discharged.” 
 
 Taking a serious cognizance of the incident, the police have registered a case of stalking against the suspect and also slapped him with several sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). Inspector   of the Kranti Chowk police said, “Police will investigate why the school failed to prevent the entry of an outsider.”
 
 The school principal denied that the matter was brought to her notice. She said that school is from 7am to noon for boys and from 12.20pm to 5.30pm for girls. “We will check if someone during the shift change wrote something on the wall.”
