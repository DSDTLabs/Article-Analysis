LUCKNOW: Amid   for the coveted post,   took over as the chairman of   

 This is a departure from the tradition as in previous governments it was the   who would hold the post, though former CM   assumed the chair during the last few months of his regime when the Yadav family feud was at its peak.
 
 Highly placed sources told TOI that not only ministers, but also senior officers were lobbying for this post which controls enormous budget and carries out developmental works in rural areas and for farmers. 
 
 However, the CM has refused to oblige anyone. Mandi Parishad controls majority of farmer welfare schemes all over the state and is the biggest body to work in rural areas. It also acts as a bridge between the cultivator and consumers.
