NEW DELHI: Arvind   on Monday opposed in the Delhi high court the second Rs 10 crore defamation suit against him by Union minister Arun   over the use of an objectionable word by the chief minister's former lawyer Ram  . 

 Kejriwal claimed before Justice   that he had never instructed his Jethmalani to use any scandalous words against Jaitley during recording of his evidence.
 
 Jaitley had filed the second defamation suit after Jethmalani allegedly "abused" him in the open court during the proceedings of the original defamation suit he had filed against the   chief and five other party functionaries. 
 
 The chief minister, however, maintained that apart from the ground of "absolute privilege, the present suit is also barred by Section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act".
 
 "The statement, upon which the suit is based on alleged defamatory imputations made by the senior advocate (without any oath), allegedly on the instructions of the defendant (Kejriwal), which he could not have disclosed," Kejriwal said in his written statement filed through advocate Anupam Srivastava in the high court. pti
