PANAJI: Vegetables at Goa state horticulture corporation limited (GSHCL) outlets have been arriving late for the past few days leaving impatient customers disappointed with the services. Attributing the reason for delay of supplies to climatic conditions, horticulture officials said timings will be restored post-summer.

 Prasad Halarnkar, who manages the GSHCL outlet at  , said, “I have residents, as well as government employees, purchasing supplies from this outlet. Most of them, especially, working clients, are in a hurry. It’s not a pleasant experience when I have to ask them to come later because the required supplies aren’t there.”
 
 Assuring that the issue will be resolved soon, horticulture managing director Madhav Kerkar said that due to summer, trucks sourcing vegetables from Ghataprabha, start the journey at nightfall when the atmosphere is cooler. Even   trucks start their journey later in the night. “We have to take such measures, else the vegetables supplied will not be as good. The timings will return to normal once the temperature comes down.” he said.
