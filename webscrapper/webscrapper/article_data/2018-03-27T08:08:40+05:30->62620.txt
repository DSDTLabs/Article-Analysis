AHMEDABAD: The state government has only received Rs 21 lakh as   for the project to recover population of the Great Indian Bustard.

 The government in its reply to the question of Surat West MLA Mukesh Patel has said that the Centre has in 2015 decided to give a grant of Rs 187 crore for the conservation of Great Indian Bustard but the Centre allocated only Rs 12 lakh in 2015 while the same in 2016 was Rs 9 lakh.
 
 Officials said that the government under the project has sanctioned a breeding centre in Gujarat,. But   had in 2016 pipped   as a Great Indian Bustard (GIB) breeding site. Following stiff opposition from the Rajasthan government the central government has removed Gujarat from the list of places that have breeding centres for the dwindling   population. 
 
 According to an informal census carried out by the state forest department, there are just six bustards left in Gujarat. Population of GIB has dropped to less than 300 in the country.
 
 Earlier, Gujarat had been identified as a breeding centre but following opposition from Rajasthan the Centre selected Rajasthan.
