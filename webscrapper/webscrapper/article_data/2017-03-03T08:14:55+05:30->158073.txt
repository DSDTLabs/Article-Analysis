NAGPUR: The   was a buzz of activity as six final year students, three from painting and the other three from sculpture, got busy displaying their art works at an exhibition titled ‘Hueva’ which opened on Thursday. “The title has been created by joining two words, Hues meaning colours and the two letters from yuva which means youth,” said Bhau Dandade, principal of Cisfa.

 Nine sculptures and 32 paintings have been put up by six students who will graduate this year. The exhibition was inaugurated by  , vice-chancellor of  . 
 
 Appreciating the efforts of students, Singh said, “These students have given four years to master the craft and have honed their skills with the use of numerous mediums. I am sure their hard work and training will get them positive results.”
 
 The six students in the two sections are Mansi Adatiya, Netan Kolte, Rintu Sil, Gauri Deshpande, Akash Matkar and Pratik Reddy.
 
 “This presentation means a lot to us as it helps us to observe reactions of people to our work. We were a very small class but then we could concentrate and learn better. But a larger class would have offered more competition and a wider exposure to works of fellow students of art,” said Pratik Reddy. But for Rintu Sil whose nine works of sculpture are on display, the class size was of no consequence. “I enjoy the freedom of expression that art as a medium gives us. Learning art has taught me a lot about life and if my work is good then I can express myself through it and also earn money.” 
 
 The exhibition will be open till March 4 and one of the applied arts will be held at the same venue from March 7.
