Vadodara: Days after the workers at the   plant in Halol decided to observe fast to protest against the management, the company has refuted allegations of injustice to the workers. Nearly 600 workers of the automobile giant had announced a week ago that they will work in the production unit but observe fast to protest against inadequate compensation. 

 GM India’s spokesperson said, “As said many times earlier, we are consolidating our manufacturing operations at the Talegaon plant.   is treating our impacted employees with the dignity and respect they deserve through this transition. We understand that relocating from one plant to the other is a significant change for some and movement from one region to another can be a crucial decision involving families of the concerned employees.”
 
 “Starting from the decision to move, to the employees settling we support them through the entire process. Beginning with a visit of the employees to the new location before transfer and other miscellaneous expenses are taken care of by the organization. Support required for adapting and assimilating into the new work environment is all taken very seriously as we are committed to ensure a smooth transition for all those employees who choose to relocate,” the spokesperson added. 
 
 GM had earlier announced that it will cease vehicle production at its Halol plant from April 28 this year. The company had also stated that it has given options of a ‘significantly enhanced separation package or continuity of employment at our Talegaon plant’. 
 
 The   (GMEU) has alleged that the workers were promised adequate compensation but the management offered them only Rs 10 lakh which is not enough as their livelihood was dependent on this plant. “The workers want compensation between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 40 lakh,”  , president of GMEU had said.
