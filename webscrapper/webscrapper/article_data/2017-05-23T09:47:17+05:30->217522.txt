PUNE: Seven years after she lost Rs 15 lakh to a  , a 24-year-old woman from   got him   on Sunday.

 The medical aspirant lost two years of her academic career due to the tout, who had taken her original marksheet and Rs 15 lakh in 2010. 
 
 “On Sunday, the student had gone to   for dinner and noticed the tout. She immediately contacted the police control room and got   (39) of Koregaon Park arrested,” said Sachin Dhumal, sub-inspector of the Market Yard police station.
 
 Dhumal said the suspect has been arrested under Section 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC. He was produced before court on Monday and has been remanded in police custody for three days. He is an MBA graduate from Indore.
 
 Dhumal said the woman came in contact with Kasaliwal in 2010. “He had told her he had good contacts in a prominent medical college in Dhankawdi and can ensure her admission,” Dhumal said.
 
 He said the suspect first took Rs 50,000 and the complainant’s original marksheet. He used various reasons, like paying the fees of the entire course in one go or bribing college authorities, and sought more money, the official said. While he took the money in cash sometimes, other times he asked for it to be transferred to a bank account.
 
 When the student realised she was being duped, she began demanding her money and certificates back. “However, the suspect stopped responding to her,” the officer said.
 
 In 2012, the suspect suddenly contacted her and returned her marksheet. “He had promised to return the money and also requested her to not contact the police,” the officer said.
 
 Believing him, the student did not lodge a complaint against him. “When the complainant started pursuing him for the money, the suspect again disappeared,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said that as the original documents were with the tout, the student lost two years and could not pursue MBBS. She is now studying a different medical course.
