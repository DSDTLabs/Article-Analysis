THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 45-year-old fisherman,  , succumbed to injuries he suffered in a stray dog attack at Pulluvila near here on Monday. Dogs had mauled a woman, Siluamma (65), to death in the area in August last year.

 Josklin was attacked by dogs at   near   around 11.30pm on Sunday and he succumbed to injuries at medical college hospital around 5.30am.
 
 Residents said he had slept on the beach overnight. “He was alone on the beach and was randomly attacked by dogs around 11.30pm. He was waiting for other fishermen to launch the fishing net. He was immediately taken to hospital but could not be saved,” ward councillor Vincent Sebastian said.
 
 Taddevus, a fisherman who tried to rescue Josklin from stray dogs, said they saw him being pursued by the pack. “At first we heard some loud barking. We then saw him being chased by dogs. By the time we reached the shore, he was lying unconscious and dogs ran away at the sight of flashlights,'' he said.
 
 Josklin was first taken to Neyyatinkara hospital, from where he was rushed to medical college hospital. Hospital authorities said the flesh on his arms, face and thighs was bitten off.
