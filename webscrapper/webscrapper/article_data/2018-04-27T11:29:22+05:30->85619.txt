 "We, the undersigned faculty members of IIM Bangalore, are writing to express our deep anguish, sorrow, anger and disappointment over the turn of events in Kathua and Unnao. After  , as a nation we vowed to make the country safer for everyone, especially for our women and girls. Your Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign and the need to nurture responsible sons brought hope for a brief period. But that hope has repeatedly been trampled upon. While violence of any kind against anyone is abhorrent, using a child as a political and communal tool reveals the level of depravity we have sunk to," reads the letter written by about 60 professors of the premier institute.
 
 Referring to the Kathua and Unnao crimes, the letter says, "In these specific cases as in several others, the law and order machinery has clearly failed the nation... To rebuild this lost faith, we join crores of Indians in demanding uncompromised justice for the victims... In the process, we need to ensure that justice is blind to politics, ideology, religion, caste, gender or any other form of identity of the parties involved.   has no meaning otherwise."
 
 Commenting on the punishment needed for those indulging in such crimes, the letter says, "The severity of punishment should be such that it acts as a deterrent to such abominable and horrific crimes." The letter has been sent to the President and the Union ministries concerned as well.
