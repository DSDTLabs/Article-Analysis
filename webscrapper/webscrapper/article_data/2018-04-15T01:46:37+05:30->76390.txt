 The professor, however, said, “She submitted her work on April 2 and wanted to get the papers signed on a back date, which I can’t do. I also told her one also needs 10-20 days to read the thesis.” 
 
 He added, “What she is doing is mental harassment as she is blackmailing me to get her thesis cleared as she has to travel abroad. I had given her time for a meeting next Wednesday. But on April 12 she came to my room with a professor from Denmark and the professor manhandled me.”
