AHMEDABAD: The   has ordered that the   “very seriously” the disappearance of a 16-yearold girl, who has been missing for four years. After being taken to task by the HC, the   had promised to make special efforts to   a few years ago.

 Justice J B Pardiwala ordered the CBI to immediately take charge of the investigation of the case of the missing girl — Jaladhi, from Ahmedabad. Considering the case history, the HC noted, “The case prima facie is one of human trafficking. The investigation should be taken up by the CBI very seriously. One does not know in what condition the daughter of the applicant must be as on date. One is not sure whether she is still alive or has been killed. She might have been forced into prostitution, etc.”
 
 Jaladhi has not been found despite the HC ordering the state CID to trace her. After nearly a two-year probe, when the CID told the court that it had made all efforts to trace the girl, Justice Pardiwala did not accept the claim.
 
 Jaladhi and her friend Neha went missing on October 4, 2014. Neha returned four days later, but did not reveal anything about Jaladhi. Jaladhi’s parents approached cops, and later the HC by filing a habeas corpus petition. The HC ordered the CID to probe the case, but the family did not notice any development for three years.
 
 The family moved the HC again and demanded a CBI probe on the grounds that the CID did nothing during all these years and did not support its efforts to trace the girl. The HC said, “This is something very serious and I am not satisfied with the report placed on record to show that all possible steps are being taken to find the missing girl.”
 
 For the petitioner’s family, advocate Roma Fidlis highlighted how Neha gave evasive replies about her friend and was never questioned by CID sleuths. The financial condition of Neha’s family improved suddenly after Jaladhi’s disappearance, she alleged.
