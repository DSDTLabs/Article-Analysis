Pune: Environment experts and activists have said that an initiative such as the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Environmental Status Report (ESR) should not just identify the issues of the city, but also execute plans to mitigate them. 

 They said the civic body should be more accountable in its approach to such problems, which impact all city residents.
 
 Biologist Sachin Punekar, of BioSpheres, said the PMC cannot take up all the issues without an inclusive approach. “Issues identified in the ESR are important and the civic body should approach them in tandem with various expert bodies, including the pollution control board, biodiversity board, and NGOs working in various fields. It should form a local consortium of all these experts and make the best use of available resources,” he said.
 
 Lt Col Suresh Patil (retd) of Green Thumb organisation said the PMC also needs to consider taking into account areas that are essential to the city. “We work towards de-silting of the Khadakwasla reservoir, which augments the water capacity. This added water supply can help aid the city’s water demands. However, whenever we have taken up the issue with the civic body, their response is that the water bodies do not fall under their jurisdiction. Are the reservoirs in the Sinhagad and Panshet valley not the main source of water for Pune?” he said.
 
 The PMC, meanwhile, responded that plans are in place for many issues but changes can’t happen overnight. 
 
 Environment officer Mangesh Dighe said, “The approach we have taken in most cases is long-term and so the change will not be seen overnight. Issues of mass transport — Metro and CNG buses —green fuel, reducing congestion, waste management and segregation are being taken up.”
