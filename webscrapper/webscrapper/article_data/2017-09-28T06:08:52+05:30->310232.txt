NEW DELHI: General and reserved category students left out of   this year now have hope.

 As many as 301 vacant seats for admission under these categories have opened up in   after Delhi high court on Wednesday ordered DU to follow its past practice of excluding   category students from the 2,310 overall seats.
 
 DU had for the 2016-17 year clubbed 2,310 seats with 301 seats meant for a third category in LLB course called supernumerary candidates meant for persons with disability/children and widows of armed forces/foreign nationals.
 
 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar found DU’s decision to include 310 supernumerary seats within 2,310 total seats as untenable and made it clear that DU will make required adjustments to ensure that 2,310 candidates are admitted over and above the supernumerary candidates.
 
 The court’s direction came when a group of students approached it pointing out that Delhi University was required to admit 301 candidates in the reserved categories as supernumeraries over and above 2,310 seats but it has clubbed both.   is hearing a PIL filed by a lawyer against reduction of seats for Law Faculty by Bar Council of India. The petition deals with the objections by BCI to the number of seats to which the students can be admitted to the LLB course of the Faculty of Law of the Delhi University.
 
 The court agreed and while ordering 301 supernumerary seats to be excluded from 2,310, the bench also told DU that its cutoff date of August 31, 2017 “shall not come in the way of these candidates being permitted to join the LLB course” who will get admission after DU excluded 301 seats from the 2,310 seats.
