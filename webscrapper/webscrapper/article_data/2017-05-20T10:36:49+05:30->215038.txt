COLVA: On May 6, Benaulim   Churchill Alemao gave out a clarion call to his constituents to vote for his panels at the panchayat elections on June 11 in the villages of Seraulim, Colva, Benaulim, Varca, Orlim, Carmona and Cavelossim.

 His contention was that if panchayat members are in sync with the MLA, development can take place rapidly.
 
 None of the other candidates who contested the assembly elections earlier this year, like former MLA Caetano Silva, AAP’s   and Congress’ Edwin Baretto, seem to share his view.
 
 Silva told TOI that if a candidate needs his help and approaches him then he will surely help, but he will not form panels of his supporters because he feels that villagers should take care of their villages and politicians and MLAs should not interfere in civic body elections.
 
 Fernandes and Baretto who are panchayat members said they are not in the fray for local body elections this time round. Infact, the former is not even in the country. Speaking via social media she said that she is of the opinion that local body elections should be left to the villagers to decide and not fought on party lines. At the same time she says that if AAP volunteers and supporters take the plunge at grassroots politics, “we will be bound to lend support”.
