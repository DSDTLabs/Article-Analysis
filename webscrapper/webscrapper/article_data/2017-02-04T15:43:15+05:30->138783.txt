With his popularity on the rise, the handsome actor   has crossed one million followers on Instagram. His fa following increased with the success of his shows ‘Naagin’ and ‘Pardes Mein Hai Mera Dil'. On being asked how he feels on crossing one million followers, he says, “I am extremely happy and overwhelmed with my Instagram followers reaching 1 million. I can’t be happier and just want to thank everyone for supporting me and giving me so much love and always standing by my side during all my ups and downs. I think ‘Naagin’ was an exceptional show and it did really well. Even now, the repeat is coming on different channels and is still doing very well. It has put me on a different platform. ‘Pardes’, too, is still being appreciated, I just can't thank my fans enough for making me what I am today. I would also like to thank   and   for believing in me and trusting me that I can pull off such tough characters". About his popularity and success being an example for other actors, he says, “Other people may think that I am very successful, but for me, honestly, I feel I have just started. I have lot more to do, many characters to play and explore new avenues, so I am going to keep working hard. The journey is more important than the success and I just want to have a fulfilling journey in this industry".
