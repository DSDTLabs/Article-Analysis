It’s a great time for Malayalam film industry with brilliant movies hitting theatres and also raking in the moolah at the box office. The latest film setting records in terms of collection is Mammootty’s   and the megastar took to his social networking page to thank the fans for the success.

 “I want to thank each and every one of you in making the Great Father such a huge success! It's broken the first day opening collection record, the fastest 20 crores collection to date and all of this with a relatively modest 6 crores budget and made by a first time director. This is a celebration and an eye opener to the size and power of the Malayalam audience like no other ! Here is wishing for our industry to continue growing bigger and better so we can make even better and bolder films!!,” he wrote.
 
  also has Ranjith’s Puthenpannam coming up next in which he plays millionaire named Nityanand Shenoy. If The Great Father is any sign, Mammootty could surely rule the box office this month.
