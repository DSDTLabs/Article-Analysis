BENGALURU: In a virtual acknowledgement of large-scale corruption and violations in Aadhaar enrolment, the Centre has asked   - one of the largest registrars under the   (UIDAI) - to stop the services. 

  "In view of the enormous number of complaints of corruption and enrolment process violations against Aadhaar enrolment/update centres under CSC e-Gov, it may not be possible to extend the MoU with CSC. CSC, is therefore requested to process its exit from the UIDAI system," said a letter from the communication and IT ministry addressed to  , CEO of CSC. A copy of the letter written on February 6, the details of which are emerging only now, is with TOI . 
 
  The letter, signed by  , assistant director general with the IT and electronics ministry, said a decision had been taken in a meeting at the Prime Minister's Office that enrolment centres would now work only out of government premises, banks and post offices. 
 
  CSC, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) under the IT and electronics ministry, which also oversees the functioning of UIDAI, has generated at least 18 crore Aadhaar numbers. It used to operate 11,280 permanent enrolment centres and 2,706 update centres. 
 
  "...The CSC is requested to process its exit from the UIDAI system...and close Aadhaar enrolment/update centres working under it in a phased manner without causing inconvenience to the public," the letter said, without elaborating on what action may be initiated on the complaints that have been already registered. There are reports that the shutdown of the centres would affect at least 38,000 jobs. 
 
  The 2012 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two agencies said CSC was being engaged, given its large presence across various states in the country. It also laid down stipulations to be followed while carrying out the enrolment. There are more than 20 such registrars under the UID.
