LUCKNOW: As politicians turn to deities and seers to seek blessings for electoral success, BSP chief   too has sought divine intervention. She sent her deputy and party national general secretary   to offer ‘chaadar’ at   Sharif and pray for her party’s success in the crucial assembly elections.

 BSP sources said Siddiqui and his son Afzal flew to Jaipur from where they would head to Ajmer on Wednesday when polling in 40 assembly constituencies of UP would be underway. A close associate of Siddiqui confirmed to TOI that the BSP leader will be offering a chaadar on the party’s behalf. A host of other BSP cadre workers are also expected to attend the prayers. Mayawati sending her party leaders to offer prayers at the world famous dargah comes close on Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting temples before launching a roadshow in Varanasi. 
 
 Mayawati is not known for her religious affiliations though she follows Buddhist practices. The elections year, however, saw the Dalit leader taking the religious routes off and on. She first got a special yatra organised for Hindu pilgrims during Kumbh and then another one for Ajmer Sharif last year. At the same time, she kept greeting people on all religious festivals, including Eid, Diwali and Christmas.
