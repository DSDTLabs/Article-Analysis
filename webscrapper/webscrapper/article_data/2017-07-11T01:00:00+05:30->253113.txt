KHAGARIA: The fate of proposed girls’ hostel at Mahila Mahavidyalaya, a constituent unit of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), hangs in balance even after approval and disbursement of funds almost a decade back.

 Sources said a proposal for construction of girls’ hostel with an estimated cost of Rs 1.1 crore was sent to the University Grants Commission (UGC), eastern regional office, Kolkata, during the 10th Five Year Plan by the then principal in-charge of the college in 2005.
 
 “The UGC, however, sanctioned Rs 80 lakh for the construction of the hostel and the first instalment of Rs 40 lakh was released to the college 10 years back. The foundation stone of the hostel was laid by the then TMBU vice-chancellor Prema Jha on October 26,2009. The construction work is, however, yet to start for the reason better known to the college, university as well as district administration officials,” said a source, adding a portion of the land meant for construction of hostel has been encroached by locals.
 
 “Principal in-charge Sanjeev Sharma has requested the district administration to get the land vacated. Once the land is made encroachment-free, construction work will start,” said a source.
