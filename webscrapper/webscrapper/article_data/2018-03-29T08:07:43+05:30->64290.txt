GURUGRAM:   of Sector 23A have complained that   has left stormwater   uncovered in the area for over a year now. Many of the slabs are damaged with iron rods jutting out, posing the risk of accidents, residents said. An elderly woman reportedly fell into an uncovered drain last week and suffered injuries.

 Residents said they took the issue up with MCG several times, but it is “dragging its feet.” “At least 40% of the drains across this sector are uncovered. This area was with   earlier, and MCG took it over in 2016. We tried to pursue the matter with both authorities, but nothing has been done so far,” said Malkhan Singh Yadav, president of Sector 23A  . 
 
 “An elderly woman fell into an uncovered stormwater drain last Saturday and she suffered a ligament rupture in her hands,” Rohit, another resident, said.
 
 Yadav said they had made repeated requests to the civil engineering department of MCG. “But MCG has not bothered to consider it critical,” he said.
 
 Residents also expressed concerns about the poor condition of the roads. “The   are broken and full of dust. It is difficult to walk on them, and many residents have ended up spraining their ankles,” Yadav said.
 
 Residents alleged that a tender to construct roads was announced in February this year, but has been languishing on the table of the chief engineer. “We have met all senior MCG officials, including the previous commissioner and joint commissioner, but the matter is still stuck,” Yadav said. MCG officials could not be reached for a comment.
