THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   Kaleeswaram Raj will represent   in his fight for justice for his brother Sreejeev, who died following alleged custodial torture, in the state high court. The members of Justice For Sreejith forum took the decision in this regard after holding talks with Raj over phone on Sunday.

 Shyam Thampanoor, one of the social activists, who had been supporting Sreejith’s cause for quite some time, told TOI that Raj was chosen from a list of names suggested by various persons.
 
 ‘’We all agreed on his name because he was not only an acclaimed lawyer but also known for his interventions outside courtrooms, in social issues’’, Shyam said. The members of the forum also consulted with lawyers in  , who turned up at the protest venue to offer their support, before taking the decision. The lawyers also helped them in drafting a petition to be filed before the high court seeking a CBI probe. Steps were taken to deliver the draft petition to Kaleeswaram Raj, who is in Kochi at present, by Monday.
 
 When contacted, advocate   said that he hoped to file the petition before the court without any delay.
 
 On Sunday, thousands of people, including youths, senior citizens and women, from across the state had turned up in front of the Secretariat, where Sreejith is engaged in an indefinite agitation for the last 765 days, to offer their solidarity to his cause.
 
 Former KPCC chief V M Sudheeran and actor Tovino Thomas too visited Sreejith and offered their support.
