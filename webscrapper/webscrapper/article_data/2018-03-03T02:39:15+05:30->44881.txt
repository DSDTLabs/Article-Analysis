MUMBAI: The high court on Thursday asked the railways if it had complied with directives to take measures to tackle overcrowding in trains and death on tracks. A division bench of Justices   and   asked the railways to file an affidavit about implementation of its suggestions including subways below platforms, walls to prevent access to tracks, patrolling of tracks and status of emergency medical rooms at stations. 

 The court was hearing a PIL by activist Samir Zaveri on the issue of track deaths. The court had asked the railways to set up EMRs at all stations in a phase-wise manner. Over 3,000 persons die every year on Mumbai's suburban railway network while crossing tracks, falling off crowded trains, falling into the gap between platform and train and electrocution. As per the court's orders, the railways had started setting up EMRs at stations. 
 
 Advocate Arif Doctor, counsel for the petitioner and advocate Jamshed Mistry, who was appointed as amicus curiae (friend of the court) told the high court that directions issued by the court in 2017 are yet to be implemented.
