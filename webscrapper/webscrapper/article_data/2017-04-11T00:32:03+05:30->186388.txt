  : In a major drive against matka activities in the state, Goa police on Monday raided around 100 illegal gambling dens and arrested more than 100 bookies, director general of police (DGP)   said.
  
  Chief minister   held a meeting with the DGP on Monday and directed the Goa police to crackdown on matka in the state in view of the case pending in high court. In 2015, social activist   had filed a public interest litigation before the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking action to stop matka in the state. The petitioners had alleged that the illegality thrived under the patronage of the police and politicians.
  
    held a meeting with police personnel later in the day and directed them to immediately start the crackdown.
  
  Police said that following the raids, matka activities have come to an halt in the state. All police stations and the crime branch will continue the raids.
  
  Goa police conduct a similar raid during the assembly election 2017 when all matka activities in the state were brought to a halt. However, post the polls, matka activities have resurfaced in the state.
