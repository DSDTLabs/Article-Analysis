Hyderabad: City-based   and Services Ltd on Wednesday announced the launch of its maiden product – Driverzz Mobile App – through which a customer can book a driver in the city on Wednesday. 

 The startup currently has 60 drivers on its platform and plans to take this number up to 350 by June this year. “We will be charging Rs 45 for every 30 minutes in the city and Rs 60 for every 30 minutes outside the city. The drivers will be on our rolls and will draw a fixed salary over and above the incentives,” Next Drive Transportation and Services Ltd chief executive officer and managing director Hitachandra Kanaparti said.
 
 The company, which has been conducting the pilot of its app since October 2016, has been clocking around 75-80 trips per day and has already serviced around 500 customers in the city.
 
 While this year we will be focussing on Hyderabad, by next year we will be driving into Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. By 2022, we plan to be in 45 cities, he added. Going ahead, the company also plans to launch products in the area of car parking and cleaning, among others. The company has raised over Rs 75 lakh from its family and friends and plans to raise another Rs 15 crore in the near-term to finance its growth plans, Kanaparti added.
