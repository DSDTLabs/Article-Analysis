CHARMINAR:  , a resident of Fatima Nagar, is used to making regular rounds of the Bhadurpura mandal office and Shamsheergunj Andhra bank branch, and every time she returns empty-handed. The 61-yearold widow has not received her monthly old-age   for the last four months.

 Fatima, whose needs to take medication for her many ailments, has not been able to buy them for the past four months. And none of the officials at the mandal or the bank are able to tell her why her pension has not been released. “I am is totally dependent on medicines. I used to buy my medication with the pension I received, but for the last four months, I have not received a single rupee. It has taken a toll on my health and the many visits to the bank and other offices have exhausted me further,” said Rahmat Bee, with tears running down her cheeks.
 
 Many residents of the Old City say they have not been receiving pensions on time. They said the Telangana government has changed the widow pension beneficiary rules and made them more complicated for the old people.
 
 Like her, dozens of people said that they have to make scores of visits to offices to collect the monthly pension of `1,000. “The official apathy towards my problems makes me feel quite hopeless,” said Fatima, another widow. “The officials are not willing to spend time explaining the new rules to us. We don’t know where to go,” she said. Bhadurpura tahsildar E Naveen said many people forget to provide a‘proof of life certificate’, which is necessary for pensioners. “If anyone fails to submit the annual verification certificate, the pension can be stopped,” he said.
 
 The tahsildar confirmed that the lack of knowledge about the annual verification certification and other processes is causing the problems. “We are currently carrying out awareness drives to help people understand the rules made.
