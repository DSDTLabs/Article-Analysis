Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has continued to neglect the dilapidated   despite an incident over a month ago. Chawls were declared dilapidated around 23 years ago.

 On August 12, a portion of one of the chawls caved in injuring Bhuru Sheikh and his daughter Sania. The two survived as the portion caved in on a tin roof. The NMC swung into action and decided to vacate the residents and demolish the chawls within 24 hours. But since then, the NMC has done nothing forcing people to reside in the 100-year-old chawls.
 
 An NMC official told TOI that a notice will be issued to developer P&P Associates and residents of chawls in the next couple of days. “Earlier, NMC had issued notices to National Textile Corporation (NTC) and chawl residents. The need is to issue notice to the developer. The developer and residents will be given seven days to vacate the area and demolish the dilapidated chawls. Action will be taken in case of non-compliance of notice,” he said.
 
 There were 13 chawls in the NTC’s 3.16-acre Model Mills land. The NMC had declared all 13 chawls dilapidated on July 25, 1994. Two chawls caved in and the remaining 11 are on the verge of collapse. A part of many of these 11 chawls also caved in. Still, around 1,000 people are residing there.
 
 As per Model MillsChawl Punvarsan Kruti Samiti, the residents will continue to live there until rehabilitated by the developer. “NTC had planned redevelopment project of Model Mill chawls on PPP model 10 years ago. NTC had appointed P&P Associates to redevelop 3.16 acres of Model Mills chawls. The plan was to demolish chawls and construct flat schemes as well as commercial complex,” said on the chawl residents.
 
 “Altogether 416 chawl residents were supposed to get flats free of cost, with the remaining to be sold by the operator to recover the project cost. NTC and PPP developer failed to turn up in the last ten years,” he said.
