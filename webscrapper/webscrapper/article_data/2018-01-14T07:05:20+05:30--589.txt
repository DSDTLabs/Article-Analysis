NEW DELHI: A day after the virtual revolt by four judges of the  , senior advocate   has alleged that Justice   — assigned to hear the judge   death case — has close relations with   and top politicians.

 News channel CNN News18 quoted Dave as having said, “Everyone knows Justice Arun Mishra has close relations with BJP and top politicians”. He also said, “Justice Arun Mishra shouldn’t hear the Loya case.”
 
 Meanwhile, in a further twist to the judges’ dissent, a petitioner in the case of the alleged mysterious death of Justice Loya has told Times Now, that Dave attempted to pressurise him to withdraw the case from the bench of Justice Arun Mishra.
 
  partisan  , the petitioner in the case, told Times Now that senior advocate Dave had tried to “bully” him into withdrawing the case from the SC bench.
 
 Dave had apparently tried to persuade Poonawalla by alleging that Justice Mishra was a “henchmen” of CJI Dipak Misra and hence the bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra was should not hear the case.
 
 Recounting the sequence of events, Poonawalla added Dave had initially agreed to his request to represent him in the court in the case but upon learning that it would be heard by Justice Mishra, suggested that the case be withdrawn from the SC and asked Poonawalla to approach the Bombay high court instead.
 
 When the Congress sympathiser, refused to act on his advice, an angry Dave reportedly walked off leaving him to fend for himself in the court.
 
 When the case was heard by the SC bench on Friday, Dave, who was apparently not representing anyone in the case, pleaded before the bench to let the matter be withdrawn, Poonawalla claimed.
 
 On Thursday, CJI-led bench had assigned the public interest litigation seeking a probe into the death of B H Loya, who as special CBI judge was hearing the case of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh’s ‘fake’ encounter to an ‘appropriate’ bench. On Friday, it was listed before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.
