NEW DELHI:   (BJD) leader Tathagata Satpathy made a controversial remark in the   on Friday, saying people who do not wear helmet while driving two-wheelers should be left to die.

 Participating in the discussion on the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill, Satpathy said, “If people violate helmet norms, let them die. We are already an overpopulated country.
 
 However, role of police in checking helmet violations should be done away with as it was for the safety of the people who themselves should be responsible.”
 
  lawmaker   objected to Satparthy’s observation. “Saying that helmets should be done away with is an obnoxious statement to make and should be expunged,” she demanded.
 
 Introducing the bill,   Minister   said the main aim of the proposed law is to “save human lives” and it would bring about the much needed reforms in the transport sector through “maximum governance with minimum government”.
 
 The bill received support from all political parties and members termed it as a move in the right direction to reduce road deaths. At least 1.46 lakh people died on Indian roads in 2015.
 
 “India is a country, where it is easiest in the world to get a driving licence. Here, one person gets licence from four states,” he said adding the new law will address these issues.
 
 A transparent online system for grant of licence will now be put in place under which everybody will have to undergo certain tests for getting it,” he added.
 
 Gadkari said, “Under the new system, everyone --from a political leader to a film actor and journalist --will have to go to the licence issuing authorities under a uniform procedure and if licence is not issued in three days, the RTO will have to face action.”
