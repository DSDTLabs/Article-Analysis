Amritsar: Seventeen-year-old  , a Class XII student from a village along the   border, has been selected for the prestigious   award for bravery for rescuing 15 children from a school bus that had plunged into a drain in September 2016. Karanbeer, who was in the bus with the children and was injured, showed great courage and helped other children to come out of the bus, which was fast filling with water.

 Speaking about how he overcame his fears,   told TOI, "I couldn't see my fellow students drown. "I jumped in the dirty water of the drain and one by one saved 15 students from drowning because I knew how to swim better than others." 
 
 
 
 
 A resident of Gaguwal village in Amritsar, Karanbeer Singh emerged as a hero when the school bus he was travelling in along with 37 other students, including his younger sister, fell into the drain from a bridge in Mahwa village. The kids were on their way to MKD DAV Public School. Seven students including three girls, all between the aged between seven and 14 years had died in the accident while 13 had sustained injuries. Had it not been for Karanbeer, the death toll would have been much higher.
 
 The award will be given to him and 17 other brave children from across the country. The awards, given by Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) are divided into five categories – Bharat Award, Geeta Chopra Award, Sanjay Chopra Award, Bapu Gaidhani Award, and General National Bravery Award, and will be given away by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 24.
 
 President Ramnath Kovind will host a reception for the children who will also participate in the Republic Day parade on January 26.
 
 Son of farmer Devinder Singh, Karanbeer who is currently in Delhi, said he was happy he had made his parents and his village proud. “In the future I aspire to be a police officer and help others,” he added.
