JAIPUR: Is   headed back to  ? If his Sunday’s tweet is to be considered a hint, that looks quite likely.

 
 “Looking forward to making an announcement to you guys this week which I’m very excited about & yes it involves the #IPL2018!,” Warne tweeted on Sunday morning. 
 
 Given that he led the Royals to victory in the inaugural edition of the   in 2008, the Jaipur-based team could well be his most-favoured destination. He could be back as a coach, mentor, consultant or any other capacity that suits his schedule. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Rajasthan Royals, returning to the IPL after a twoyear ban, so far haven’t appointed either a coach or a mentor. In fact, they are on the lookout for someone in that capacity and according to sources, Warne is very much in the picture.
 
 
 With former Mumbai batsman   returning as the chief of Royals’ cricketing operations, Warne has become a strong candidate. Bharucha was the director of cricket from 2008 to 2015. He is said to have enjoyed a very good working relationship with Warne. Even the Royals management had a comfortable working relationship with the Australian.
