TRICHY: The   (IRTSA) has demanded that the Union government fill up supervisors’ vacancies immediately. It also said that disciplinary appeal rules action should not be taken for system failures such as quality, out-turn and target-oriented matters except on disciplinary matters.

 Advisor of IRTSA, Golden Rock division, H  , said that various resolutions were passed at the annual general body meeting. They included demands to fill up all supervisor vacancies immediately. Another resolution stated that the annual performance appraisal report grading must be made without affecting modified accelerated career progression.
 
 The meeting also stressed the need for production control organisation (PCO) allowance to be granted as per 7th pay scale announced by the Union government.
 
 Baig said that annual overhauling and maintaining of locomotives are carried out in railway workshops and each loco would be delivered after completing maintenance work on a fortnight basis. However, authorities have not made arrangements for the required spare parts. So, technicians are forced to use worn-out parts or substandard materials, he claimed.
 
 “When using sub-standard spare materials, there is no guarantee that the loco would not develop snag. When a situation arises like this, employees should not be held accountable for the snag. However, authorities are purposely fixing the blame on supervisors or technicians concerned. That should not be done,” he said.
