THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Around 1,800 people including children gathered at Kerala State Science and Technology Museum and Priyadarsini Planetarium on Wednesday evening to witness a rarest of rare   in the sky which happened after 152 years. 

 A once in a lifetime spectacle, people made a beeline to watch  , a blue moon and   together. Initially, presence of clouds marred the easy viewing of the celestial event. But later the clouds cleared from the sky, much to the respite of the people who gathered at the venue. 
 
 “Earth’s shadow started passing over the moon by 7.37pm. The shadow finally passed the moon by 9.37pm,” said Arul Jerald Prakash, director of Priyadarsini Planetarium. “We arranged an open lecture and demonstration on this phenomenon. Against our expectation, around 450 people registered. So we have arranged lectures on the celestial phenomenon, which were delivered by IIST professor Anand Narayan and ISRO senior scientist Raj Shekhar,” he said
 
 The moon appeared in orange-red colour initially. However, it changed to normal colour when the eclipse began. 
 
 City resident Beena said that she was super excited to witness the triple treat. “From 5.30pm we are waiting here,” said Beena, who came along with her children to watch the event at planetarium.
 
 “Since this is hailed as rarest of rare event, we did not want to miss it. So when we heard planetarium is arranging an opportunity for people to witness we registered. Initially, we were little disappointed due to the cloudy weather,” said Karan, a media student.
 
 As the celestial phenomenon was visible to the naked eye, many more residents were able to witness it in different parts of the city.
