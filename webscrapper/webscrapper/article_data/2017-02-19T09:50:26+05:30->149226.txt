LUCKNOW: Unidentified miscreants stole a licensed revolver, Rs 30,000 in cash and important documents after breaking the window panes of a parked   in Vikas Nagar on Saturday.

 Kunwar Bhupendra Singh of Viram Khand 3 left for Vikas Nagar, where he had some work, in his SUV that was being driven by Ramlal. On the way, he stopped on Ring Road and sent Ramlal to purchase some sanitary hardware from a shop.
 
 While he waited in the car, Singh was approached by a youth who claimed some oil was leaking from the bonnet of the car. “I ignored him and we drove on once Ramlal came back after shopping. On the way, two youths came close to the car to tell us that some goods had fallen from the car’s boot.” 
 
 He said they continued, only to stop at a petrol pump where Ramlal parked the vehicle. “I left for some work while the vehicle was parked on service road. Ramlal left for Tata Motor Agency to meet someone. A little later, he returned to find the window panes broken and the bag containing the revolver, cash, PAN card, Adhaar card and other important documents missing,” he said.
 
 Police spokesperson Arun Kumar said a case of theft had been registered.
