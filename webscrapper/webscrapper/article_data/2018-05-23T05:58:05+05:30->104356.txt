AHMEDABAD:   leader and the independent   from Vadgam, Jignesh Mevani, who gained prominence after his agitations following the   flogging incident, will meet the family of   Vaniya, the Dalit man beaten to death near Shapar town in Rajkot district, on Wednesday.

 Mevani said, “I am in Vadgam for scheduled works for the people of my constituency. My team and I will meet the victim’s family on Wednesday. This incident is more horrific than Una, as a Dalit died after he was beaten by the five accused persons. The state government must ensure speedy justice and not just the lip service that was done during Una.”
