NAVI MUMBAI: The   has rolled out a Rs 50-crore drinking   project under the   that will get completed in March 2018. 

 The project involves buying 20 MLD water instead of the current supply of around 9 MLD from MJP. There is an attempt to store water in various parts of the township to ensure adequate pressure of water. 
 
 The project entails work on a 38.5km pipeline network, including replacement of old pipes and laying of new ones. Residents of the old township will soon get five elevated source reservoirs, taking the total number to 10. 
 
 The work started in October 2017 when municipal commissioner Sudhakar Shinde took charge. “The extra reservoirs will help in storing treated drinking water in the growing township and will ensure equitable distribution of water supply,” Shinde said.
 
 The current population of the old township has been pegged at around 1.50 lakh and is expected to increase to over 2 lakh by 2022. 
 
 The requirement of drinking water, which at present is 29 MLD, will also increase and   has already made arrangements with the MJP by augmenting supplies.
