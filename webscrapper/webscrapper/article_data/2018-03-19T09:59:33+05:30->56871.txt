HYDERABAD: Carbon dioxide emissions have come down by nearly 1,29,719 tons in the city after the   (GHMC) implemented the LED illumination project last year. Since the inception of the project last July, the civic authorities in tandem with the central government agency   (EESL), have replaced around 4 lakh streetlights with LED in the city.

 The replacement of conventional lights is not exerting pressure on the GHMC coffers as the civic body is not shelling out money for the project. “Rather, it is saving money by slashing electricity bills. The LED lights are of 18, 35, 17, 110 and 190 watt capacities and are brighter than the old lights,” said GHMC officials.
 
 There are 4.53 lakh streetlights within  , of which 4 lakh have been replaced with  . “The remaining lights are mostly in playgrounds, parks and residential areas. Works are on to replace them with LED by this month,” B Ashok, superintending engineer of the electrical department, GHMC told TOI.
 
 The use of LED lights has decreased electricity consumption by 162.15 million units worth ?115.13 crore per year. GHMC is saving nearly Rs 7 crore per month. “Earlier, GHMC had to spend Rs 15 crore per month for electricity, but after implementation of the LED project, the monthly electricity bill has come down to Rs 8.25 crore,” said Ashok.
 
 The corporation has installed 15,363 automatic switches in sync with sunrise and sunset timings. The existing 9,599 manual switches will also get the automatic system soon, GHMC officials said.
 
 Similar projects have been taken up in other cities. But while the GHMC introduced 4 lakh LED streetlights in one year, the   did only 2 lakh and Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation replaced 1 lakh lights during the same period.
