The two met on the set of the mythological show 'Ramayan', in which   played Sita and Neil essayed Lakshman. They started dating in 2011 and a couple of years later, Neil even said he would make a formal announcement about their relationship after their families approve of it. A source says, “They wanted to tie the knot, but realised they were having compatibility issues. Soon, the relationship hit a rough patch and they decided to part ways in 2016. They maintained a dignified silence after that.”
Neil says, “I don’t want to talk about the past. When you realise that you are not meant to be with a person, it is better to move on. Neha and I split almost a year ago and I don’t want to divulge the reason. I think we were not meant for each other; it happened for the best. I want to be with a girl who understands me. At the moment, I’m only focussing on my career.”
 Neha, who will be seen as   in the upcoming show ' ', says, “I am too busy preparing for my role to think about something that’s clearly in the past now.” Ask her if she is still in touch with Neil and she replies, “No. I believe when the time is right, you find the right person. There is no point crying over spilt milk. It’s a closed chapter. I’m busy with other things in life.”
