NEW DELHI: After mediation proceedings for six days in the  , tennis ace   and his estranged partner   failed to sort out their differences for an ‘out-of-court’ settlement.

 The mediation was done on the direction of the apex court, which had asked the couple to sit together to explore ways to come to an amicable resolution of their dispute. Both Paes and Pillai appeared before the Supreme Court’s mediation centre where six rounds of proceedings took place for over 18 hours.
 
 The couple is locked in a legal battle over maintenance and custody of their 11-year-old daughter since 2014 when Pillai had filed a case of domestic violence and harassment against Paes and his father in a magistrate’s court in Mumbai. She had sought maintenance but her plea was opposed by Paes who claimed that he was not married to Rhea.
 
 While hearing an appeal filed by Pillai challenging the order of  , which had refused to grant her relief in the matrimonial dispute, the apex court on January 13 asked the couple to go for mediation. 
 
 Both the parties agreed to give a try for mediation although they had earlier also went for mediation on the direction of the HC and failed to resolve their differences. The proceedings in the SC mediation centre started on January 31.
 
 Paes’s lawyer   and Pillai’s counsel Dipesh Mehta, who appeared in the mediation centre with their clients, said both parties participated in the proceedings with a positive approach and tried their best to come to a mutually acceptable solution but it could not fructify. “Six rounds of proceedings took place but unfortunately the mediation failed.” Mehta said.
 
 After seeking divorce from actor Sanjay Dutt, Rhea had moved in with Paes and was in a live-in relationship. In June last year, the HC had also asked the couple to sit down together and work out an amicable solution. However, they failed to arrive at a settlement.
