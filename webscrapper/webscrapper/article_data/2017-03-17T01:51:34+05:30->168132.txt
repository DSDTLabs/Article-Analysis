NEW DELHI: Swaraj India chief   said that the municipal   should focus on keeping Delhi   and give up works like management of   and hospitals to the state government.

 Speaking at the CII Delhi State Annual Session, Yadav — whose party will be contesting its first election ever on April 22 when polls are scheduled for the three municipal corporations — said that Delhi is among the dirtiest cities across the world. He said that nobody living in Delhi was doing so happily due to the massive pollution in the city.
 
 “An IIT Delhi study has shown that there were 49,000 additional deaths in Delhi last year due to pollution. Strangely, there is no discussion on municipal governance even though it is so crucial for the city. We need to fundamentally change the structure of municipal governance,” he said. Swaraj India’s plan to revamp the corporation, other than improve sanitation, includes measures for increasing revenue. Yadav said that 12% of overall taxes should be given to the corporation for its smooth running. 
 
 “At present, the Centre is harassing the state government, which in turn is harassing the corporation but the final victims of this mess are the people of the city. Other than a 12% share in taxes, the corporation should also increase taxes that it can impose for improved sanitation,” he said.
