LUCKNOW: The   the   visited   on Friday and secured footage from two cameras in which the killers’ movement had been captured. 

 Clips from a camera outside Shravan’s residence and another located within an ATM booth 250 metres from his residence were taken into possession and have been forwarded to an expert for processing.
 
 Giving a political twist to the case, a group of BJP leaders which included Union power minister Piyush Goyal and mayor Dinesh Sharma met the Sahu family on Friday evening. The group assured the family that they would push for CBI inquiry into the case.
 
 Earlier in the day, members of business and traders’ association met DGP Javeed Ahmad to press for CBI inquiry into the case. An elderly man, Shravan Sahu was gunned down by bike-borne assailants on Wednesday night outside his house.
 
 Shravan’s son Ayush was killed in October, 2013 allegedly by a history-sheeter   at a beer bar over a trivial argument. Shravan had been pursuing his son’s case. On January 12, Aqeel had allegedly threatened Shravan to lie low, but Shravan rebuked the accused. Aqeel is reportedly the prime suspect in Shravan’s murder case now. As police colluded with Aqeel to intimidate Shravan, the family had been demanding CBI probe in the matter.
 
 Ahmad said that the family’s application will be forwarded to the home department for further action. “We will forward the matter to the government recommending CBI inquiry. Policemen who had colluded with Aqeel or were found negligent in providing security to Shravan, will be dealt with strictly,” said Ahmad.
