Ludhiana: Asking officials not to bow down to political pressure while carrying out their duties, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu has told them to speed up the process to recover dues in order to improve MC’s financial condition.

 He said if officials face any trouble, they should instead report such matters to him.
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh has already fixed monthly collection targets for officials of the building branch (Rs 7 crore) and operations and maintenance cell (O&M) (Rs 16 crore).
 
 The mayor also claimed that there would be no House meeting unless there is money with MC. He only those contractors should come forward for development works who trust him and Congress party, knowing that they will get their payments.
 
 Sandhu said, “I have given a free hand to officers to collect pending dues from defaulters without caring for political leaders. In case anybody creates hindrance in their work, then they should complain to me. The councillors can create ruckus in the MC General House meetings and I will take care of that.”
 
 However, the process to recover dues is yet to gather pace. Officials of O&M cell have demanded help from officers of other branches like property tax and superintendents of other branches so that recovery could be fast. And the officials of building branch are relying on the policy for regularization of illegal colonies.
 
 Building branch officials claimed that they were hopeful of receiving applications from colonizers, therefore they would be able to meet their targets.
