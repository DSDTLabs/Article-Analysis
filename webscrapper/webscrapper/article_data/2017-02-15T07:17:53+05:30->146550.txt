NEW DELHI: As the   judgment threw   out of the chief ministerial race in Tamil Nadu,   asked the governor to call   for government formation, with a composite vote in case of two claimants to power.

 Congress spokesman   said, “BJP and Modi government should now stop fishing in troubled waters.
 
 Role of the governor, which has been circumspect in this entire episode, must now become clear and the Constitution must prevail. The governor must forthwith call a special session of the Tamil Nadu Vidhan Sabha to permit the ruling party, including more than one claimant if any, to prove their majority.”
 
  chief Thirunavukkarasar said, “There was 7-8 day delay in the earlier matter and whether right or wrong, there was some logic in it because the Supreme Court had said the judgment will be delivered this week. But with a new AIADMK leader, the governor has to call him for swearing-in without further delay.” 
 
 The remarks indicate a bid to roll back the criticism of governor   for sitting on Sasikala’s claim to chief ministership. Surjewala only called his role “circumspect” while the Tamil Nadu Congress chief accepted some merit in the delay.
 
 Congress appeared to concede that the SC judgment had vindicated the governor, whose delay in inviting Sasikala was also backed by senior party leader   against the party line. However, Congress believes there is little excuse for the governor to further drag his feet. Chidambaram said if there were two claimants, the governor should call a composite vote. 
 
 A leader said the fact that only around 10 MLAs had defected from the Sasikala camp in a week showed the official party faction had the majority support and rebel O Panneerselvam faced impossible odds in his bid to regain the CM’s chair.
