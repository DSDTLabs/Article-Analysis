Calangute: Calangute police on Sunday night rescued four minor girls who were found wandering on Baga beach without any guardian.  The rescued girls are in the age group of 11to 16 years, Calangute PI Jivba Dalvi said. The girls were rescued with the help of the NGO, Scan-India, and their statements recorded. After obtaining an order from the child welfare committee, the rescued girls were sent to the Apna Ghar in Merces. Earlier on Saturday night, four minor boys had been rescued in similar circumstances at Calangute. Calangute police recently launched a drive to rescue minor children who roam the beaches in the popular Baga-Calangute-Candolim belt, either begging or hawking wares. Shack owners on the beach stretch have welcomed this move. In a note to the tourism minister and the director of tourism, the Shack Owners Welfare Society, general secretary, John Lobo said that the IRB personnel deputed on the beach were doing a good job of rounding up these unaccompanied children.
