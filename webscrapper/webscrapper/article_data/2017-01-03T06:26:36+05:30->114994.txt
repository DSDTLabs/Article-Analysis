The   a child whose chortle sounds off the panels.   waiting outside don't as much as take a second look at the kid in the   whose chequered image keeps flitting in and out of the intricate  . For her it is a playhouse, for old-timers at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology and Government Ophthalmic Hospital in Egmore, the `box' evokes images of patients being shakily ferried to the wards above -a chore the elevator carried out for more than a century before falling into disuse.

 Few know when it was first installed. Some say it could be as old as the 19th century building that houses it, a handful believe it could be the oldest in Chennai. The make and the inscription on its iron counterweight - R Waygood& Co Ltd, London - are the only clues to its story.
 
 A search about the company reveals it was started by Richard Waygood in 1830 at a spot in London that later became elevator giant Otis' head office in the UK. Waygood was rechristened `R Waygood and Co Ltd' in 1897. The elevator could have been installed in the oldest eye hospital in south Asia around this time.
 
 “The elevator has been clearly modified over the years, but the art-deco influence is still evident in the carved wrought iron cage and wooden panels,“ says city-based architect Xavier Benedict. Such elevators, which most often had a bench to sit on, were quite popular in India between 1900 until the late 1930s, he adds.
 
 The elevator at the Egmore institute keeps cranking into action from time to time. “It was working till two months ago, but it's a struggle to maintain it,“ says director Dr K Sridhar director. A 79-year-old mechanic oils the pulley and the grilles. “But few use it as it takes time to rev to life,“ he says.
 
 On Monday, the child seemed the only life in the wooden box which blends into the building's history but remains an anachronism to the world outside.
