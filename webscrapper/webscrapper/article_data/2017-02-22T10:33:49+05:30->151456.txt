BHAGALPUR: JD(U) MLA from Tarapur and former   (BAU) vice-chancellor   has been booked for gross irregularities in the appointments at BAU during his tenure as VC. A case was lodged with   police station against him and others on Tuesday.
 
  Mewalal was the founder VC of BAU at Sabour ( ) and served the university till 2015 before contesting the assembly election from Tarapur in Munger district on a JD(U) ticket.
  
  Sabour SHO Neeraj Tiwary said the case (35/17) was lodged against Mewalal and others under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) on the basis of the complaint submitted by the BAU registrar. The BAU had submitted a 100-page complaint in a sealed envelope to Sabour police station on Monday in this regard.
  
  The BAU administration initiated legal action against Mewalal following the chancellor’s nod after a probe committee found that many appointments during his tenure were made by ignoring the candidates’ performance in written test and academic records. Those selected were given high marks in interview and PowerPoint presentation (PPT) by the screening committee, sources said, adding that even PhD degree holders and   qualified candidates were ignored for the assistant professor and junior scientist posts.
  
  According to BAU sources, the probe team found gross irregularities in the appointment of 161 assistant professors and junior scientists in 2012, beside others. The probe committee was headed by Justice (retd) Syed Mohammed Mahfooz Alam of the Patna high court. The panel was constituted by the chancellor after allegations of irregularities in the BAU appointments were made by several aggrieved applicants.
  
  Given the fact that the accused is a ruling party MLA, no BAU official was ready to discuss the topic.
