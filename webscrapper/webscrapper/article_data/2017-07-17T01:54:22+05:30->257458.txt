NEW DELHI: An 11-year-old   died mysteriously two days after complaining of pain in his throat and chest in   of   district. While his family members have alleged that he developed the complications after a group of boys tried to choke him at school, police said there were no external injury marks found on his body.

 The family members told TOI that they found the boy’s behaviour erratic after he returned from school on Friday. He went to play at a park near their house in the evening, but when he returned around 9pm, he started complaining about pain in the chest and throat to his mother. “His mother served him hot milk and put him to sleep,” said his father, Ram Babu.
 
 At 7am the next day, when Babu went to wake his son, the boy woke up crying with extreme pain in his throat and chest. He was unable to speak as well. When the worried father questioned the boy, he came to know that his son had been bullied by three unknown students at school.
 
 The boy was rushed to   and found with major complication while breathing. He was put on oxygen, but his pain still did not subside. He was then shifted to   where he died during treatment. The family then called the cops. The parents alleged that the boy had been poisoned after which his body was sent for autopsy.
 
 DCP (Rohini) Rishi Pal said the police will be questioning the school authorities to get a clearer picture about the incident.
