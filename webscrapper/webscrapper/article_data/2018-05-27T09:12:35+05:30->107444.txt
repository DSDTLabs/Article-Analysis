 LUCKNOW: Studying ‘rotation’ from his physics books for CBSE class XII exams was getting difficult to grasp for city topper Balbeer Yadav.
 
 
 It was when the student of   took to YouTube and visualized the concept through online lectures of Prof Walter Lewin of   of technology (MIT) along with his books, that he ultimately scored 97 marks in physics.
 
 “I was able to understand the concepts and get a clear picture through his 3-D visualizations that helped me analyse the subject deeply. Any student then can learn more through visual aid in comparison to other methods,” said the 17-year-old student who scored an overall 98.4% . An hour or two of these lectures were part of his daily study routine.
 
 Anukriti Singh, a commerce student who obtained 91%, was happy about the fact that time is not a factor in online studies now and she could clear her doubts whenever she wanted to and did not have to wait for the right time to consult her teachers.”
 
 “Learning apps and the online portal of the CBSE to get a feel of the exam scenario by practising sample papers available on the internet was a new way of studying I experimented with this year”, said  , who secured 93% in the science stream.
 
 A chemistry teacher,   also supported the study online concept, suggesting that first all the students should study from their teachers and then move onto the online exercises to be more thorough.
 
 “The general feeling is that internet and smartphones distract from studies, but now a number of students are scoring well by employing these unconventional ways. It has all got to do with a student’s focus,” said another teacher.
