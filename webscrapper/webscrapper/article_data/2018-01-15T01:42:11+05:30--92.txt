 A division bench of Justices Rajendra Savant and Sandeep Shinde considered the circumstances in the case and ordered the quashing of the FIR against the woman for attempt to murder her husband. 
 
 “Normally...we would have considered the request for quashing by consent with same circumspection. However, having regard to the peculiar facts of this case, wherein the couple is belonging to a strata of society which finds it difficult to make two ends meet, as also considering the fact that the woman is suffering from schizophrenia, we are of the view that continuing the prosecution would perpetuate the difficulties... of the couple,” said the judges. “We are, therefore, of the view that the interest of justice would be served if the request for quashing of the FIR is acceded to.” 
 
 In September 2017, the woman attacked her husband with a knife. A neighbour, who witnessed the incident, lodged the FIR and she was arrested. Recently, a petition was filed seeking to strike down the FIR claiming the couple had decided to settle the case. In the affidavit, the man said his wife was undergoing treatment for her ailment at the time. “During 15 years of married life, this is the only solitary incident,” he said in the affidavit. He informed the HC that he did not have any grudge against his wife and sought her release from prison so as to enable him “to take care of her and give her proper psychiatric treatment”.
