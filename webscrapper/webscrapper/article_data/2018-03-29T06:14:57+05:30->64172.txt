GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: A 60-year-old man, who assists   in managing vehicle movement through an underpass connecting Noida and   beneath NH-24, was allegedly beaten up by a man attempting to overtake others on Wednesday. The victim, Sanjeev Trehan, is a member of the   (CVF) formed by Ghaziabad police to assist cops in traffic management and various other drives in the city. Trehan lives in Shipra Sun City and has a catering business. He has been regulating traffic at the underpass for the past 10-odd years.

 According to Trehan, the crime took place at around 7.30 pm when he was regulating traffic at the underpass with the help of a constable. Trehan and the constable,  , had placed barricades at the underpass and were allowing vehicles to move in queue from both sides.
 
 “A man and a woman seated in an Alto overtook all other vehicles that had queued up in the direction of Indirapuram from Noida. The car driver wanted to pass through the underpass before everyone else. I tried to persuade him to get into the queue and signalled him to stop. But he got down the vehicle and began thrashing me. I sustained head injuries and an injury to my ear drum as well,” Trehan told TOI.
 
 Trehan voluntarily manages traffic at the underpass during peak hours every morning and evening. At the time of the crime, Trehan was standing on the Noida side of the underpass under the limits of Sector 58 police station. A PCR van that reached the spot took Trehan for medical examination to the district hospital, Noida.
 
 “The man who had thrashed Trehan has been identified as Ankit Tyagi. He has alleged that Trehan waved a staff at his car which hit the windshield thereby cracking it. Both of them have agreed to settle the matter among themselves,” SHO, Sector 58, Anil Pratap Singh told TOI.
