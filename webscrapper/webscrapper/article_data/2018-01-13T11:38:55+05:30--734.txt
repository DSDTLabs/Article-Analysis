 Sainudeen, the cinematographer of   and the upcoming   2, has now turned director with the bilingual Street Lights. The film stars   superstar  , who has also produced it. 

 “It’s an entertaining thriller, and the Tamil version is set in Chennai. We have cast a different set of actors for Tamil and Malayalam versions. Prithvi Pandirajan, Black Paandi, Sreeram (of Pasanga fame), Naan Kadavul Rajendran, Stunt Silva and Semmalar are acting in the Tamil version. Mammootty sir, who is the lead character, plays a gritty cop. Pandiarajan will be seen in a crucial role,” informs Shamdat, who reveals that   Haasan had a role in choosing this title.
 
 “I told him that I was making a film and that I was not able to find a title in Tamil for it. He was the one who suggested that I retain Street Lights as the title in the Tamil version, too. When I told him I was apprehensive about having an English title because they don’t give tax exemption here if the title is not in Tamil, he assured me and said that the rules were going to change soon, so I need not worry. In fact, he felt that an English title will help my film stand apart,” reveals the cinematographer, who claims to be a die-hard Kamal fan.
 
 But he says that he has not discussed the script with Kamal. “I have not told him the script, as I believe that only those associated with a film should know its script. In fact, I haven’t even discussed the script in entirety with my actors. Only Mammootty sir knows it, and that’s mainly because he is the producer,” he says.
