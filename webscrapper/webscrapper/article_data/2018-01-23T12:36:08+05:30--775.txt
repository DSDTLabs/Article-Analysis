 The court also rejected her application for seeking the call data records of  , the father of the accused and two other people. However while accepting her plea of calling for the Black Berry Messenger (BBM) messages which were allegedly exchanged between Jiah and Sooraj, the court held that they would be called, as and when required during the trial of the case.
 
 The actress was found hanging in her room on June 3, 2013, and Sooraj was arrested a week later for abetment to suicide.
