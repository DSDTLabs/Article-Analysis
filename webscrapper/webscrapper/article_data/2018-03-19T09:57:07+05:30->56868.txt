THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Following protest over serving nonvegetarian dishes at the canteen at   ( ) headquarters, devaswom minister   has directed to serve only vegetarian items hereafter.

 “A directive has been issued to devaswom board officials stating that the canteen should only serve vegetarian dishes. Apart from protests against including non-vegetarian dishes, there were also attempts to give a communal angle to the whole issue,” said the minister.
 
 The canteen was started on Wednesday following the demand from board employees.
 
 A few Hindu organizations came out against the canteen serving non-vegetarian dishes as it is situated adjacent to a temple. A campaign was launched on social media too.
 
 Since the canteen caters to outsiders other than devaswom staff members, the person who runs the canteen on contract basis started serving non-vegetarian items. Now, the protest has forced the minister to issue the directive.
