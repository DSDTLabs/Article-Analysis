CHENNAI: The   in the state have also unearthed a 135-acre private   owned by a minister and his family members in  . 

 A senior Income Tax official said, "Our preliminary assessment shows river sand at the yard is worth at least 50 crore. We will carry out a survey of the yard with experts, probably on Monday, to assess the quantity and its market value". 
 
  As per government norms, Public Work Department engages contractors for sand mining and loading on trucks. The contractor is to be paid 100 for every 100 cubic feet of sand sold at the quarry. Including the cost of sand, loading charges and value added tax, a truck of sand (400cft) should cost only 2,080 at the river bed, but that is never the case. 
 
 Contractors, with tacit understanding of Public Work Departmen officials, transport the sand to their private stock yards and sell it at rates ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 per truck load. The sand loot in the state is estimated at 15,000 crore per annum. The stock yard identified by the sleuths is a reminder of two such yards that thrived in Kancheepuram district till 2013. 
 
 In that year, the Madras high court came down heavily on the administration for allowing illegal stocking of more than 50,000 truckload of sand at Palayaseevaram and Kallapiranpuram in Kancheepuram district. Following the court order, the government took over the two yards.
