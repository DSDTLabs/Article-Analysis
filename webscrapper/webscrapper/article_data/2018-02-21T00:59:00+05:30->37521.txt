Trichy: The health ministry has asked Medical Council of India (MCI) to reconsider its decision to bar students of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) from appearing for the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) this year. This has given a flicker of hope to thousands of medical aspirants writing their plus 2 through the NIOS board who were to appear for NEET, the national entrance test for MBBS admissions across the country. 

 The ministry in its letter dated February 1 contended that CBSE had granted recognition to NIOS and considered it equivalent to other recognized boards. It also observed that excluding NIOS qualification for NEET would be unreasonable and unjust as around 1,500-2,000 students from NIOS board wrote the test every year.
