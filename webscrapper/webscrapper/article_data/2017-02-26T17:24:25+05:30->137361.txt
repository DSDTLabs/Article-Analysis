News had broken on Wednesday that  , second son of Sreenivasan, is getting married. 

 Sreenivasan himself has confirmed the news to us that Dhyan is indeed getting married, but no, not to Namitha Pramod as grapevine had suggested earlier, but to his long-time girlfriend  . 'The wedding will be held at Kannur, on April 7th. Arpita is from Trivandrum and she is working in Technopark,' says Sreenivasan. The engagement, he says, will be held on April 2, at Trivandrum. 
 
 How long has Dhyan known Arpita? 'I haven't asked that. There is no need to ask all that,' he says, laughing. And how does he and his wife view the fact that Dhyan is marrying from a different religion? 'It's their wish. And their wish is more important, right? There is no need for me to interfere,' says Sreenivasan, adding that he doesn't even know what exactly his gonna-be daughter-in-law works as! Meanwhile a source from the family says that 28-year-old Dhyan and Arpita have been in a relationship for a while now. 'They met through common friends in Trivandrum and Arpita was in Chennai as well. Sreenivasan and his wife are perfectly fine with Dhyan's choice.'
