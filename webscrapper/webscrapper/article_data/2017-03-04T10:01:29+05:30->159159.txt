Prithviraj   released the   poster of the highly-anticipated film   on his social networking page, and fans have been raving about it – thanks to its epic design and Prithvi’s look in the movie.

 The film, directed by Jiyen Krishnakumar, has Prithviraj playing Aslan Mohammed while   plays Pattabhiraman. 
 
  wrote, “When a nation talks about its today, it will have not just one but a thousand yesterdays. There would be the face of a hero who is the representation of a thousand forgotten, invisible faces. The one who searches for him is the aforementioned… When miracle meets man… Epics are born.”
 
 In a recent interview with us, the film’s scriptwriter   told us, “The movies will be reflective of our times. Though contemporary , the stories will also have resonance with history .Tiyaan is set and shot entirely outside Kerala. Yet it's about how a Malayali and his mindset figures in the socio-political scenario of India. It will have a few time periods that are used as references but the story is set and evolves in the current timeline.”
