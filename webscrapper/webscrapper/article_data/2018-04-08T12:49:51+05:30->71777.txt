ITANAGAR: Two tiger cubs, rescued in 2012 from   in   district in Arunachal Pradesh, have grown up in captivity and now can't be released them into the wild due to delay in procedures, forest officials said today.

 Male 'Ipra' and female 'Chipi' have been brought at the   here in September 2013 after they were rescued from Angrim.
 
 "The tigers are well settled now and they have gained weight and increased in size. The approximate weight of the male tiger now is around 300 kg while the female weighs more than 200 kg," park curator Raya Flago said.
 
 Fed on the stipulated diet of 10 kg beef each per day, Ipra and Chipi were supposed to be released in the wild but it is too late now as they have grown and might not cope well in the wild. Moreover, delay in certain official procedures has sealed their chance for releasing in the wild, he said.
 
 "During 2015 we have submitted a proposal to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for releasing Ipra and Chipi to the wild. However, due to delay in certain formalities it could not be materialised. There are certain protocols to be followed for releasing tiger in the wild," he said.
