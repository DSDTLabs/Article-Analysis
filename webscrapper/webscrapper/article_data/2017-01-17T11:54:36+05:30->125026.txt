LUCKNOW: Even as Jal Nigam’s plan to check sewage discharge into the Gomti failed to yield results, seven other drains on the city’s outskirts add to the pollution levels in the river. 

 Subsequently,   drew up a proposal to connect these drains to sewage treatment plant (STP) and it has been approved by the Union ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga conservation. The proposal was sent a year ago and the project would cost Rs 456 crore. The funds, expected to be disbursed to Jal Nigam shortly, would go towards upgrading the capacity of older drains, strengthening old pumping stations, tapping new drains and building new STPs. Jal Nigam has plans to upgrade the STP infrastructure by 2033, an official said.. 
 
 Lucknow has 33 drains. Among old drains, sewage flow from nine drains is diverted to the Daulatganj STP while that from the remaining drains is diverted to the Bharwara STP. Lucknow produces 675 MLD sewage daily. Of this, 401 MLD is diverted to STPs for treatment, while the remaining flows into the Gomti untreated. Of the untreated sewage, 100 MLD comes from the seven new drains on outskirts.
