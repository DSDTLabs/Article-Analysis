NEW DELHI: With an aim to make travelling by autorickshaws safer, particularly for women, Delhi government’s transport department is thinking about making it mandatory for autorickshaws to install   buttons. If the plan fructifies, all autorickshaws in Delhi will have panic buttons by mid-2018.

 “The idea of having a panic   in autorickshaws is to make travelling in them safer, particularly for women commuters,” said a transport department official. “The plan is at an initial stage now but we already have the technological capability in the backend to track such panic calls. We have to ensure that   drivers install panic buttons in their vehicles or activate buttons that already exist in new autorickshaws,” he said.
 
 The official said that the panic button would be connected with the GPS device of an autorickshaw and the moment a passenger presses the panic button, an ‘SOS’ icon would flash on the GPS tracking screens at the department’s control room. “We would be able to find out the precise location of the autorickshaw immediately and take necessary action. As we have the mobile numbers of all autorickshaw drivers in our records, we can contact them directly to warn them too,” he said.
 
 There are about 90,000 autorickshaws in Delhi and almost all of them have GPS devices, even though most are not functional currently. “First of all, we would have to ensure that the GPS devices in all autorickshaws are functional. We would be reaching out to autorickshaw owners and drivers soon to make them aware that a functional GPS device is part of the permit conditions and they have to ensure that these operate properly,” he said.
