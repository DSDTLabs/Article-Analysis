MUMBAI: Ten years ago, the Centre sanctioned the   at a cost of Rs5,300 crore and with 2015 as deadline. While there has been no dearth of funds, the railways is still struggling to complete the project that’s aimed at increasing the suburban network’s capacity. In the meantime, the project cost has gone up to Rs7,300 crore.

 MUTP II includes extension of   line up to  , laying the sixth line between   and  , and the fifth and sixth lines between   and Parel, besides many other works.
 
 Under the project, railways has been able to procure 72 rakes and converted traction system from 1500 V Direct Current to 25 KV AC current on Central Railway. However, the crucial work on augmentation is progressing very slowly. For instance, railways has completed only 10% work on Mumbai Central- Borivli six line while work is yet to begin on Kurla-Parel fifth and sixth lines. Work on extending the Harbour line till Goregaon from Andheri was held up because of encroachments, but it’s likely to open this month.
 
 The CAG had in its August 2016 report noted that “out of 43 (works) undertaken on the Mumbai suburban (network), there was time overrun in respect of 26 of them ranging from one month to 69 months as compared to the original target date of completion.” Six other works, the report said, were incomplete though the deadline had passed, taking the total number of projects delayed on CR to 32. On WR, it found "time and cost overrun in all the 21 projects" it examined.
