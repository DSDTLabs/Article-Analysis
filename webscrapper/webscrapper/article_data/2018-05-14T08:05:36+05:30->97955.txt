 Around 46000 personnel of West Bengal Police, 12000 of Kolkata Police were getting support from around 1500 security personnel from other states.
 
 It is notable that there was widespread violence between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and opposition parties during the nomination filing process that claimed lives of many people.
 
 While West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that 14 TMC supporters were killed in the violence, the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that its 52 supporters were killed.
 
 The run-up to the Panchayat Polls also saw a legal battle that reached up to the Supreme Court.
 
 On May 10, the apex court set aside Calcutta High Court order that asked West Bengal Election Commission (WBEC) to accept nominations for Panchayat polls through e-mail.
 
 The WBEC had challenged the order of the Calcutta High Court, which on May 8 had directed the WBEC to accept nominations of Communist Party of India- Marxist (CPI-M), which had reportedly filed around 800 nominations through email within the stipulated time before 3 p.m. on April 23.
 \ The nomination filing process had started from 2 to 9 April and then again on an extended date on April 23. The Supreme Court had also expressed disappointment over the "unopposed election" of the ruling TMC for 34 per cent seats.
