NOIDA:   protesting against the alleged “arbitrary fee hike” by  ,  , have written to the district inspector of   (DIOS), asking him to take action against the school. 

 They said if action was not taken they would approach the chief minister and the education department (Meerut) against him.
 
 In the “warning letter” to the DIOS dated December 21, 2016, parents of the school students have asked him to take action against the school according to the directions of the joint director (education), Meerut.
 
 “We met you on November 23, 2016, and requested you to kindly comply with the orders of the joint director (Meerut) but you did not do it. It seems that you are scared of the school and do not want to do anything,” the letter read.
 
 Ritu Lal, a parent, told TOI that they took the step because there has been no compliance from the DIOS despite two letters from the director’s side.
 
 “Following a series of letters and meetings with the parents, the joint director (Meerut) issued notices to the school twice. But there was no action from the DIOS in the matter,” she said. 
 
  DIOS Bheem Singh told TOI, “If it is proved that any school is indulging in wrongful collection of charges, action will be taken against the school.”
 
 Former DIOS Muneesh Kumar and Indira Kohli, principal, DPS Sector 132, did not respond to queries on the phone or to text messages.
