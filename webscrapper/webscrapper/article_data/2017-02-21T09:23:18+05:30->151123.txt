KOLHAPUR: The   (MSRTC) Kolhapur divisional controller   on Monday informed that three weeks after submitting the proposal to central office no decision has been taken on lowering of fare for the Pune-Kolhapur premium air-conditioned bus service Shivneri.

 The MSRTC’s air conditioned bus service on the Pune-Kolhapur route has been incurring losses owing to poor response. Therefore, the divisional controller office had sent a proposal of bringing down the fare.
 
 “I had submitted the proposal to cut down ticket fares three week ago. The passengers were demanding for reduction in ticket price. Therefore, we sent a proposal to the central office. But no decision has taken place on the proposal so far,” said Bhanap.
 
 An official from MSRTC’s Mumbai office, when contacted, said, “We have received the proposal, but the corporation has not taken this subject on board. It will take some time. The proposal may come for discussion in the next board meeting.”
 
 Another MSRTC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “The air conditioned bus service is a burden on the MSRTC. It has failed to attract passengers owing to the high ticket rate and inconvenient timing. The MSERTC has already shut down   service. The corporation should not waste its energy on such expensive services.”
