PATNA: Medicos “boycotting work” since Tuesday night decided to resume duty from Thursday midnight as principal secretary (health) R K   held talks with them and their four arrested colleagues were released earlier in the day.

  The agitating medicos’ demands included release of the four medicos, withdrawal of the FIR lodged against 20 medicos and action against the policemen responsible for the lathicharge.
  
  Patna SSP   said the medicos were released after a local court granted them bail.
  
  “As for the other demands, we have forwarded the same to the home department with a request for proper investigation into the matter,” Mahajan told TOI.
  
  Meanwhile, the death toll in the PMCH during the last two days rose to 15 with eight deaths being reported on Thursday. However, PMCH superintendent Dr Lakhindra Prasad denied any death due to the agitation.
  
  “Those who died were serious patients,” Dr Prasad said and added senior doctors and faculty members along with additional doctors requisitioned from the office of the civil surgeon were attending on the patients.
