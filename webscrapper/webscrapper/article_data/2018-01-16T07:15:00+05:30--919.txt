Gurgaon: A day after arresting four shooters of the infamous Manjeet Mahal gang, the newly reconstituted special task force (STF) has prepared a list of all small and big gangs operational in the state, and has put them under scanner to check the crime rate and end gang war.

 According to the STF head, IG Saurabh Singh, though the team has its headquarter in Gurgaon, it has the gangsters of all nearby districts on its radar. They have prepared a list of active and dormant gangsters along with their key indulgences. The force is also keeping a watch on the gang dynamics.
 
 “We don’t claim that the situation is like a tinderbox but yes frequent shootouts in Gurgaon and surrounding areas have surely given us a reason to focus on them. Enmity is brewing between many of them and new players are joining the game. We are taking stock of the ground situation to ensure nothing gets out of hand,” Singh said.
 
 “We have been constituted with specific goal and all resources will be aimed at same. We will go ahead with systematic elimination of the trigger-friendly culture brewing here. Our focus is on the ‘big fishes’,” Singh added. 
 
 It may be noted that the Haryana government recently reconstituted the STF with its headquarters in Gurgaon. IG Saurabh Singh has been appointed as its chief. Though the force has got into action, with the arrest on Sunday being their first big catch, it will be fully functional by the end of this month.
