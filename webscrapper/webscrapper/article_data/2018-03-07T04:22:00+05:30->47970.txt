Vadodara: A  , his son and daughter were booked for illegally occupying a house on Ajwa Road which was bought by a driver identified as Vitthal Tadvi. The accused Pradeepsinh Sarvaiya forged signature of the original owner Ashok Vala on power of attorney and started living in the house before Tadvi could move in.

 Tadvi bought the house from Vala for Rs 25 lakh on January 25. He paid the money to Vala in two instalments through RTGS and gave an advertisement in newspapers inviting any objection, if any. A week later when he got the clearance certificate from the lawyer when no objections came forward, he registered the sale deed on the same day.
 
 On February 6, when Tadvi went there with his son, the lock on the door was missing and it was locked from inside. Later, a woman opened the door, who was later identified as Sarvaiya’s daughter. When Tadvi enquired about her, Sarvaiya’s son who was present there asked Tadvi to leave from there saying that his father owns the house and threatened to beat him up. When Sarvaiya’s daughter made Tadvi talk to the accused, he said that he has a power of attorney of the house signed between him and Vala.
 
 Tadvi then questioned Vala about it, who said that Sarvaiya is a cheat and many similar complaints have been made against him in the past too. Vala assured Tadvi that there is no issue with the ownership and Sarvaiya has illegally occupied the house. 
 
 The police on the basis of Tadvi’s complaint and after verifying all documents against the trio, booked them on Monday.
