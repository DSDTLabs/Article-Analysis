TRICHY: DMK working president MK   has threatened that the party would join the striking farmers if   water was not released for Kuruvai cultivation on June 12. 

 The state should ensure the farmers’ concerns were addressed through a cordial relationship with Karnataka, Stalin said while attending a marriage in Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district on Sunday.
 
 “During the M   tenure as chief minister, he had ensured our rights to Cauvery water and that he achieved by forming a friendly tie with the neighboring state,” Stalin said.
 
  Cauvery water dispute did not die down as the regime changed. It went to the Supreme Court where the apex body had given its verdict. At this juncture, the Tamil Nadu government should act wisely, he added.
 
 "A new Congress-backed Janata Dal (U) government is going to assume power in Karnataka.
 
  “At this situation what the Tamil Nadu should do is to maintain a good relationship with the new government and try to get our due share of water through bilateral talks," Stalin added.
 
 “If the state would failed to get the due share of water to Tamil Nadu, the DMK will have no option but launch a massive protest with the farmers in delta districts,” Stalin warned.
 
  Stalin extended his gratitude to delta farmers taking part in various protests. 
 
 Their demands should be addressed with utmost importance, he argued.
