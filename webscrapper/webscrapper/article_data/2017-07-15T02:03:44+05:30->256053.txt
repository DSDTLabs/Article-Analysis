NEW DELHI: Non-resident Indians may be able to cast vote soon as the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union government to take a decision within a week to give voting rights to NRIs either by amending   or the Rules. 

  A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud noted that the   had set up a committee which had examined the issue and submitted a report in October 2014. It was informed that in January 2015, the Centre had, in principle, agreed with the recommendations of the committee. 
 
  The bench also recorded that the EC committee had wide-ranging consultations and recommended the modalities through which the NRIs could cast their vote in elections held in India. "The only question, that arises for consideration now is whether the Union of India needs to accept the proposals made in the October 2014 Report, which has already been accepted in principle, by way of an amendment of Sections 20 and 20A of the RP Act or alternatively, by a mere amendment to the Rules," it said. 
 
 "On the instant aspect, the Union of India had sought time on November 18, 2016. Further time is again being sought. We afford further opportunity to the Union of India to take a final decision, whether the proposals already accepted by it need to be implemented by way of amending RP Act or the Rules framed thereunder," the bench said.
 
 "The decision rendered by the government will be brought to the notice of this court on July 21,' the bench told additional solicitor general Atmaram Nadkarni.
