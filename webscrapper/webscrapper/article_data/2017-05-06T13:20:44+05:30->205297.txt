Before using any of your cosmetic products next time, spare a few seconds and take a look at its label. Apart from the regular stuff, you’ll notice a symbol of a small jar with a number written in it. Wondering what it indicates?! Well, it is one of the most important information that your   regimen demands.

 
  
  
 
 The symbol represents the number of months the particular product must be used once you have opened it. But wait, don’t confuse it with the expiry date. While the expiry date tells the exact time till the product is safe to use, the jar symbol represents the time duration between which the product must be used before reaching its expiry date. For instance, if your foundation’s expiry date is 24th May 2018 and the symbol indicates 6M (aka six months); it means the product can be used till the expiry date but its usage is only limited to six months from the time you have opened it. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 So, if you buy   and don’t open it for another two months, then start counting from the day you actually unseal and begin using it. And if you use beauty products past their expiration date, you are unintentionally inviting bacterial infections to pay you a visit (that’s not what cosmetics are made for!). This info is for keeps, fellas!
