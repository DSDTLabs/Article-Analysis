CHANDIGARH: Even a month after the deadline of filing the  , the cabinet sub-committee constituted to ascertain the possibility of extending the retirement age of government employees is yet to convene the first meeting. Headed by finance minister  , the panel was constituted on February 3 to study the possibility of increasing the retirement age of government employees to 60 years from 58. 

 Other members in the committee include health minister Anil Vij and social justice and empowerment minister Krishan Kumar Bedi. According to information, the panel was supposed to submit its report within a month, by March 4. 
 
 Till now, the committee could not even hold its first meeting to meet basic guidelines, especially the details of employees of all departments, boards and corporations. Employee unions have termed the delay on the part of sub-committee as the government’s ploy of prolonging the issue. “If doctors’ retirement age can be increased, why not of other employees? The government never had any intention of working for the employees,” said  , general secretary of Sarv Karamchari Sangh, Haryana.
 
 In November 2014, the Khattar government had withdrawn the notification of increasing the retirement age issued by the outgoing Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led   in Haryana. While withdrawing the previous government’s decision, Khattar had reasoned that increase in the retirement age would affect the career prospects of those unemployed in Haryana.
 
 As the recruitment process could not take-off in time and bowing to the pressure of employee unions, the government was forced to look into the issue of increasing the retirement age. Currently, there are 2.74 lakh government employees in Haryana, out of which 15,000 retire every year. The government departments have a backlog of 30,000 vacancies.
 
 Both Abhimanyu and Bedi remained inaccessible for their comments on the issue.
