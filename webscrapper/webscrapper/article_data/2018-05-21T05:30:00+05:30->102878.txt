Mysuru: “Instead of being turned into a tank or an amusement park,   should be left alone to sustain its unique natural beauty,” said naturalist Prof.   here on Sunday.

 Ravikumar, who delivered a brief talk on the history of the lake was participating in the ‘Kukkarahalli Lake Watch’ organised by a city-based group of conservationists, Wild Mysuru, touched upon the need to conserve the lake, which was part of the city’s ‘living heritage’.
 
 Pointing out that the lake had a cleaning mechanism of its own, Ravikumar said, “This is a lake admired by many. Not every city has such a beautiful ecosystem.”
 
 Botanist Sampath Kumar, who was also at the event, informed the participants about the flora at Kukkarahalli Lake. He suggested the employment of aeration methods, along with water purifying plants, for cleaning the lake.
 
 Tanuja, an avid bird watcher at the lake, said that the event had been very informative and had provided new insights into the waterbody, which was the pride of Mysuru. “Ravikumar also spoke to us about the history of the lake. When he was talking about a tiny duck called Dabchick, we could see it building a nest. One learns amore about nature at such an event,” she said.
 
 Around 40 individuals, cutting across various age groups, participated in the event. The stroll around the perimeter of the lake was dotted by discussions on various trees, birds, and flowers.
