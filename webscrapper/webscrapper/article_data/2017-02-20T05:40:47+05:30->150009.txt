KOLKATA: With the demise of noted singer   on Sunday morning, Bengal lost an artist who had created a niche without relying only on playback assignments in projects like Tapan Sinha’s ‘Harmonium’ and Yatrik’s ‘Chhinapatra’.

 Well known for songs like ‘Aaj bikeler daake’, ‘Chi chi chi’, ‘Amar onge jwale rongmashal’, ‘Moynamotir pother dhare’, ‘Dur akashe tomar sur’, ‘Andhakarke bhoy kori’, ‘Sundorboner sundori gaach’, the 73-year-old   had worked with greats like Sudhin Dasgupta, Nachiketa Ghosh, Salil Chowdhury, Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Abhijit Bandopadhyay, Prabir Mazumdar and Ajoy Das.
 
 Sengupta, who was born in Chinsurah, was undergoing treatment for lung infection at the SSKM hospital for some time. Soon after her death, chief minister   tweeted saying: “Deeply saddened at the passing of legendary singer Banashree Sengupta. My condolence to her family and fans.” Singer Indranil Sen, who is the minister of state for information and cultural affairs (I&CA), described her demise as a “great loss”.
 
 Veteran singer Haimanti Shukla, who rushed to Rabindra Sadan to pay respect to the departed singer, recounted how Sengupta had joined the Saraswati Puja celebrations at her residence on January 26. 
 
 Veteran singer Arati Mukherjee thanked the state government and the music fraternity of Bengal for taking care of Sengupta before she passed away.
