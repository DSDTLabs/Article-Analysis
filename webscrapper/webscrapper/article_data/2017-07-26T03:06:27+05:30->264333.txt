NEW DELHI:   of face value Rs 6.87 crore was seized across the country until July 14 this year, of which 47,700 fake   were in denomination of Rs 500 and 41,991 in denomination of Rs 1,000, as per NCRB data cited by home ministry. 

 The face value of total counterfeit currency seized in 2016 was Rs 14.16 crore and in 2015, Rs 14.81 crore. However, sources pointed out that as compared to high-value fake Indian currency notes seized prior to demonetisation on November 8, 2016, the   seized thereafter is of an inferior quality and easily discernible from the original currency due to the latterâ€™s added security features.
