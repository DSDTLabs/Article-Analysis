LUCKNOW: In an apparent bid to stay away from controversy, Union textile minister   skipped   assembly constituency, though she addressed meetings at Tiloi, Salon and Amethi constituencies on Saturday. At various rallies in the three constituencies, Irani attacked   vice-president Rahul Gandhi over the Karnataka bribegate diary. 

 At Gauriganj, there has been dispute over candidature of Uma Shanker Pandey, who is also the district president of BJP's Amethi unit. As a mark of protest, several booth and mandal committee members have resigned. To avoid any further controversy, Irani, who had been nurturing the   constituency supposedly for 2019 Lok Sabha election after losing to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi by over 1 lakh votes, gave Gauriganj the miss. 
 
 There have been reports about details of a secret diary allegedly owned by Karnataka Congress MLC K Govindaraju. As per reports, income tax slueths found the diary during raids at the homes of Congress leaders in Karnataka. Raju is also said to be parliamentary secretary to Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.
