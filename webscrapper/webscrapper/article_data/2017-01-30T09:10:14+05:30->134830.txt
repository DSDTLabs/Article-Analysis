GUWAHATI: The state cabinet's decision on Saturday night to merge the prestigious   with the   (CCSU) has caused tension among students of the former institute. 

 The   (CCUS), which is the elected students' union of Cotton College, has vehemently opposed the merger.
 
 In a news conference held on the Cotton campus on Sunday, union president   and general secretary Jintu Thakuria urged the cabinet to review its decision, which, they said, would make the future of Cottonians uncertain. They also said it would render useless the coveted A++ grade received by Cotton College from the   last year.
 
 "We are most concerned about this merger. Students believe that the value of the degree offered by the proposed Cotton State University will be less than that offered by Cotton College. The A++ status of Cotton College will also be wasted. It will lose its identity after the merger," Thakuria said.
 
 The union said a decision to merge the college with any other institution would diminish its heritage and glory. The Cotton College was established in 1901 and has educated several leading personalities of the state and the region.
 
 "The cabinet's decision to set up a new university by merging Cotton College and CCSU will make things more complicated. Our students are already sharing the college campus with those of the university," said Thakuria.
 
 The union described the merger decision as 'one-sided'. It said students, alumni, teachers and employees of the college had been kept in the dark. Dutta added that undergraduate classes would get less priority if the merger became a reality. "The proposed university is likely to put more emphasis on research. Students of undergraduate classes will be the losers," he said.
