CHENNAI:   can soon have access to three modes of  , metro and buses to travel into the city as the   are planning to bring a bus stop closer to suburban station’s subway and metro rail station in Chennai airport.

 A meeting was held with police, highways department and officials from other agencies last week to finalise plans which are part of the proposed changes in vehicle traffic pattern on the city side of the airport. This will be implemented along with proposed traffic pattern change for vehicles at the airport.
 
 A subway from Tirusulam railway station under the GST Road leads near the metro rail station but the bus stop for the   is currently located opposite the new international terminal. Sources said the   might also provide some space near the subway so that buses can drive in to pick up and drop passengers. 
 
 Airport director G Chandramouli said, “We had a meeting last week and have requested for some modifications like shifting of a high mast lamp or installing more lights at the main entrance of the airport. Lighting also will have to be installed near the subway. The new traffic pattern changes may take one and a half months as these additional modifications need to be carried out.”
 
 An official said the space for buses was identified a long time ago but the proposal was getting ready for implementation only now. When the new terminals were being constructed airports authorities drew up a plan to make the most of the multi-modal connectivity available for the airport.
 
 Based on the request,   spruced up and modernised Tirusulam railway station and also the subway that links the station with the airport campus. There was also a suggestion that the subway could be extended closer to the terminals. But the move was pursued because metrorail station was planned closer to the main road with easy and direct link to the terminals.
