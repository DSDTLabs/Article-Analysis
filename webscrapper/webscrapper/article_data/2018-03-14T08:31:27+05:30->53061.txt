SURAT: A   erupted in a   near   on   on Tuesday afternoon.

  The godown in an open space near Iccapore was full of tyre and other scrape. The reason for the fire was not unknown and even the ownership of the godown was unclear. Sources say that scrape belongs to a multinational company located on Hajira road. 
 
 After the fire broke out at around 2.30 pm on Tuesday, thick black smoke covered the sky which could be seen from areas like Vesu and Surat-Dumas road about 10km away. 
 
 “The godown had a pile of waste material like tyre scape and as a result huge black smoke was emanating from it. There was no loss of life or injury,” said Vasant Parikh, fire officer,   (SMC) fire department. 
 
 It took five hours to douse the fire. Two fire tenders form SMC, one from nearby KRIBHCO plant and one from Reliance are pressed into service. “We are finding it very difficult to douse the fire due to lack of water. There is no source of water nearby so water is being brought form KRIBHCO plant,” said Parikh. “The fire created a lot of air pollution for the people living in the area. Until tyres or material that is present there is burnt completely, it would continue to emanate black smoke,” said ST Dhobi, a fire official.
