PUNE: Summer’s here and the heat is oppressive. So can viral infections be far behind? Doctors across the city are seeing patients with complaints of heat-related muscle cramps, blinding headaches, dehydration and exhaustion.

  (IMD) has issued a forecast for the development of heat-wave conditions over the next 24 hours. Doctors want citizens to take utmost care to keep away from heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Heat cramps are the least serious, but painful, doctors added.
 
 “ People out in the sun for work or study compulsions are badly affected. I have seen people with heat exhaustion, muscle cramps, dehydration and severe headache cases,” senior physician   said. 
 
 “Fluid and electrolyte loss often contribute to heat cramps. Similarly, senior citizens who venture out without eating anything and stay in the sun during the afternoon complain of heat-related exhaustion that includes heavy sweating and weakness,” senior general practitioner   said.
 
 A parent on examination duty said she had to carry ice packs since her daughter suffered a nose bleed. 
 
 General practitioner Santaji   said, “I see almost seven to eight cases of heat related nose bleeds (epistaxis) in the children and adolescents every day. Besides, there are cases of heat-related fatigue in the elders and sudden headaches in youngsters as well.”
 
 One must consume liquids in summer. People tend to drink cold drinks when they are out in the sun. They get them from unhygienic roadside vendors and shopkeepers and end up vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration and low blood pressure, Kadam added.
 
 Senior paediatrician   said heat-related diarrhoea takes a toll on children’s health during summer. “Cold water should be avoided. Outside food should be avoided and only chlorine treated water should be consumed.”
