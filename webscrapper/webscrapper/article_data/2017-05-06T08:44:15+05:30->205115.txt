MARGAO: Irked by the ‘menace of   indiscipline in Margao,’ residents have petitioned the deputy superintendent of police (traffic) Prabodh Shirvoikar to ensure that the the   take tough measures.

 A delegation, led by Savio Coutinho, former Margao Municipal Council (MMC) chairperson, and convenor of the ‘shadow council’ of Margao (SCM) met Shirvoikar. They appreciated work done by the traffic police at important junctions and near schools, and also submitted a memorandum pointing out to ‘the gross traffic indiscipline under the complacent eyes of the enforcement authorities’.
 
 “While police regularly challan people for not wearing helmets or not having pollution certificates, they seem least bothered about zooming bikes, reckless driving, unscheduled stops of buses, unauthorised parking and other violations,” said Coutinho. 
 
 When contacted, Shirvoikar told TOI that he had forwarded the memorandum to the Margao traffic PI, Mohan Gawde, and that he had also written to the PWD and MMC to paint speed breakers and zebra crossings, as well as installing traffic signboards .
