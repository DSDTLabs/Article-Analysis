Accompanying them will be singer   — who was recently conferred the   State Award — and Radhika Babu George, a tabla and mridangam artiste from Kochi. “This is the first time that the   women will be going out of the country. Once there, the musicians representing India will do the vocals as well as show their percussion skills with tamte, dollu and kamsaley. We will be presenting the   made by the collaboration on a website, as well as a documentary on their entire journey,” says Subhash NH, co-founder of Treeonz, the organization that is facilitating the collaboration. When asked how the women would handle the language barrier, he said, “Last year, in India, they had collaborated with musicians from the US, Spain,   and Nepal. The language issue was there only on the first day. From then on, they spoke through the language of music,” says Arun Shiva Ganesh, another co-founder. The group, which will back in the country on August 13, is banking on crowdfunding and government support for the resources.
