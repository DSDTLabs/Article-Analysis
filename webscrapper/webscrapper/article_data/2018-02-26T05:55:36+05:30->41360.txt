CHENNAI: When 82-year-old Munniammal, a mother of three, was forced to leave an old age home in  , she did not find shelter at her son’s house but a government school in Vadakarai near  . Munniammal was trying to seek the help of passersby but she couldn’t attract anyone’s attention as her voice was too feeble. 

 She was   at the school by her son Dilli Babu late in the night and was desperately looking for a drop of water. Babu left his mother behind as the owner of the house he had rented refused to let the woman stay there, the police said. A disabled man, Babu, resides in Red Hills with his family. 
 
 On Sunday morning, passersby noticed the woman lying on the school’s verandah and alerted the Red Hills police, who rescued her. Muniammal allegedly told the police that her son brought her there in an auto and asked her to stay put. She added that she was not aware why he did so. She said she starved that night. Police quoting Babu said his mother received her husband’s pension. Babu’s father was a former Chennai Port Trust employee. “As they failed to pay the monthly fee to the home, the management sent the old woman back to her son’s house,” said an investigating officer.
 
 The house owner allegedly refused to let Muniammal live there claiming that there was too many people in the house, leading to increased water consumption. The Red Hills police gave Muniammal food and clothing. She was then sent to another home in Porur. The Red Hills police did not register any case.
