 The programme was attended by state social justice minister Rajkumar Badole and minister of state for social justice  . MLAs   and   were also present for the event.
 
 Addressing the gathering on removing social disparity between classes Patil said, “For an overall improvement of our society, financially stable people should not claim the benefits of reservation and let others benefit as well.”
 
 “The Dalits and the tribal people have been grabbing the benefits of reservation for more than 77 years but the situation of these communities has not improved much,” he added.
 
 While talking about the contribution of the society Patil said that if everyone starts following this path, people from not so privileged section of the society will grow and develop.
 
 “Despite spending funds for the welfare of the society, the upliftment issue remains to be a concern for us. There are social activists and organisations working in this sector have a big part in connecting with people and ensuring that the issue is addressed in the fullest potential. Also, the common people have to ensure that the privileged gives a chance to the non-privileged in the overall upliftment of the society,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile Badole said, “Though caste system has lost its rigidity in our country, we still have to fight for inter-caste marriages. Social justice is the right of citizens and we will put in all the efforts possible to remove social and barrier barriers between people.”
