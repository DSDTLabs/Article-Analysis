PATNA: Former vice-chancellor (VC) of   (BAU) and suspended JD (U)   Mewalal Chaudhary got a major relief on Friday when Patna high court directed police not to take any coercive action against him.
 
  Chaudhary, who represents the Tarapur assembly constituency of  , was booked in a case of gross irregularities in the appointments of 161 assistant professors and junior scientists at BAU during his tenure as VC. The FIR was lodged with Sabour police station in   under sections pertaining to forgery and manipulation of Indian Penal Code (IPC) on February 21 this year. He was later suspended by the party.
  
  A special investigation Team (SIT) was also formed in Bhagalpur which conducted several unsuccessful raids to arrest Chaudhary. The issue had also rocked the ongoing budget session of the assembly.
  
  Principal additional advocate general   said while hearing the anticipatory bail petition of Chaudhary, the bench of Justice   on Friday asked police not to take any coercive action against the former VC. “The court has also sought case diary from the police,” he added.
  
  Chaudhary, the founder VC of BAU, had made appointments of 161 assistant professors and junior scientists in 2011-12. However, the advertisement inviting application was for 281 vacancies. Chaudhary had allegedly favoured undeserving candidates by giving them high marks in interview and power-point presentation.
