THANE: While there has been a drop in the overall success rate in the Thane division, students of Thane city have scored better in HSC exam this year. 

 
 As many as 16,650 students of the 19,534 Class XII students, who appeared for their exams across all streams from the 93 colleges in the   (TMC) area cleared their exams, thus slightly lifting the city’s success rate from 85.05 per cent last year to 85.23 per cent this year.
 
 While female students in these schools pushed the city’s success rate up with their impressive 89.53 pass percentage, male students scored a success rate of 81.5 per cent.
 
 Just as the overall success rate of HSC colleges in the city has increased this year the number of those securing a cent percent result has also gone up from seven colleges last year to 10 this year, including Chitalsar’s St Xavier’s Junior College, Patlipada’s Shubham Raje Junior College and Kalwa’s Laxmi Vidyamandir.
 
 Parmeshwar Gatkal, founder and principal of Shubham Raje Junior College, said, “We arrange extra lectures, prepare 10-12 question paper sets and provide a proper guidance session to help our students thoroughly prepare for their exams. A special session on time management is also organised wherein we tell students how much time must be spent on every question so they are able to complete the paper.” 
 
 Many others who missed this ideal success rate with a margin of one to two per cent have already started planning to ensure their weaker students do well in the coming years.
 
 Dr Ekta Harshvardhan, principal of Pace Jr. Science College (Thane), which secured a 99.01 pass percentage this year, said, “This year, we missed the cent percent result by a slight margin. We will be providing special coaching and counselling for the students who failed. While we are afraid that some may not want to re-appear, we will do our best to convince them.”
