MUMBAI: A couple that was denied admission to a budget hotel in   when the staff found out the two were not married have been refunded the payment they had made. 

 The Indian woman and her South American boyfriend were in India on holiday last week. They had booked a room at Fab Hotel Panchvati Residency a couple of months before and made a payment online. But when they tried to check in on May 26, the staff said they had a 'no-couples policy' and the payment could not be refunded as the booking was treated as cancelled. TOI reported the incident. 
 
 "...We have initiated a refund...," the hotel said in a statement. The refund was initiated on May 27.
 
 The couple reached Mumbai on May 26. They produced their identification at the front-desk, but the staff pointed to a sign at the front desk that couples weren't allowed. When the woman and her boyfriend told the hotel staff they weren't aware of such a condition, they were given a customer care number. 
 
 "My boyfriend and I took turns to speak to the customer care executive for nearly 45 to 50 minutes. The executive said she would look for a room for us in another hotel from the same chain. We were okay with it. But after keeping me on hold for some time, she said she had found a stipulation on the Fab Hotel Panchvati Residency's webpage about not granting entry to couples," the woman had told TOI. 
 
 "We told them to refund our money so we could head to another hotel. But the staff said the booking was being treated as a cancellation..." The couple had to scout for another hotel, luggage in tow, and pay extra at another hotel.
