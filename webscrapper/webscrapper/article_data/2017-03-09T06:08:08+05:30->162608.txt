PATIALA: The fund-starved   will have to shell out Rs 417.4 crore to   to all the   in the state that continued to be without electricity on Wednesday.

 To help the department tide over the power problem, the state government had released Rs 150 crore to the water supply department on Wednesday. However, the department will have to arrange the remaining Rs 267.4 crore. Water supply department’s chief engineer (south), D K Bansal, said power supply would be back in a “few days”. He, however, did not give a timeframe in which things would normalize. 
 
 As part of its drive to recover dues, the   has gone into overdrive in recent past, snapping electricity supply to all private and government consumers who are yet to pay their bills. In the process, electricity supply to 560 waterworks, responsible for distributing water in nearly 1,000 villages, has been snapped too. “We have pooled in more than 1,300 employees and formed teams under senior officials of the department. We are sending them to villages across the state to coax village panchayats into paying their end of the power dues,” Bansal said.
 
 He said the department had more than 7,200 waterworks across Punjab. “Of them, 3,000 are operated either by the gram panchayats or special gram panchayat, and water sanitation committees, while 4,200 were with the department. Of all waterworks whose power supply has been discontinued, 397 are with us and the rest are operated by village panchayats under a formal agreement signed with the department,” Bansal added.
