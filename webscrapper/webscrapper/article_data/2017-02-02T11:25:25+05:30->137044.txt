BHOPAL: Teachers and students in state capital have welcomed the decision of the finance minister Arun Jaitley to entrust a separate agency with the responsibility of all entrance tests.   will conduct all the examinations in higher examination, freeing Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) and other agencies. Both students and teachers have unanimously said the initiative will help different agencies like CBSE, UGC, AICTE and others to focus on academics only.

 Students said presence of one test agency will remove the issues submitting forms to different boards. “When you know that there is one agency which is responsible for conducting exams then there will be no confusion. Students need not to run different boards in case of any issue,” said Vikrant Nema, a commerce student. CBSE conducts most of the examinations right now which include CBSE UGC National Eligibility Test to select Junior Research fellows and Lecturers, Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) and National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET UG).
