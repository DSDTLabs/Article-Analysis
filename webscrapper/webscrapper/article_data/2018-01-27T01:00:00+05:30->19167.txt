If there ever was a glam event in Chennai in the recent past, this has to be it. There was oodles of fun and laughter here, as the guests mingled and caught up. Most of them had kept to the dress code and come turned out in white, which was a relief, as one was getting a tad tired of black-clad dos.   Among those present here, we spotted Sonia Agarwal, looking uber chic in a short and lacy dress. Maanu had sported an off-shoulder dress and did she look good! Among the men, Karunâ€™s sheer shirt must get a mention. The rest mostly played it safe with a white shirt-blue jeans pairing.
