KOLKATA: A  , which was forced to shut down its   temporarily, has highlighted how   is being increasingly used as a guise to cover other problems, be it politics or factionalism. A   had alleged that the club was resorting to moral policing to deny little  , which resumed only on Friday. The club, however,denied the allegation.

 
 Experts, however, feel this isn’t the only example where moral policing was being used as a ploy to settle scores. Sudipto Chatterjee, former
 
 professor in cultural studies at Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, wouldn’t like to see this incident in isolation. “In the last two decades, Bengal has seen a paradigm shift in political and moral or ethical scenario. This kind of eruption is symptomatic of a larger malice in society,” he said.
 
 The Howrah Club, Bajeshibpur Yubak Samity, had even organised the Indian premiere of Iranian director Keywan Karimi’s banned film ‘Writing on the City’ in 2016. Film director Q shot portions of a documentary and screened it there too.
 
 This club is now facing intense factionalism. Actor Joyraj Bhattacharjee resigned as the club executive committee member on Wednesday alleging that moral guardians were trying to ride piggyback on dress code issues to fight a political battle. According to Bhattacharjee, he earned the wrath of detractors for getting involved in such “progressive cultural events”. On May 2, his detractors levelled obscenity charges against him.
 
 Club secretary Debasish Gonn dismissed this. “No moral policing charges were levelled. A school headmaster who had objected to Bhattacharjee’s attitude in the club faced death threats. They are making allegations of moral policing to save their skin,” Gonn said.
