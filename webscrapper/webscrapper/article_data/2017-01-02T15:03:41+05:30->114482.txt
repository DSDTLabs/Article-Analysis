The authorities must enforce traffic rules strictly .“
 
 Traffic police authorities said multi-pronged strategy was being used to check road accidents. “We have been very strict in enforcing traffic rules and are issuing around 700 challans daily . Of this, a substantial number is for speeding and rash driving, besides helmet-less driving. We have also started reflector drive and targeted around 25,000 vehicles in 2016. We have deployed more cops at the black spots and are making road users aware of traffic rules by holding regular awareness programmes,“ says additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic)  .
