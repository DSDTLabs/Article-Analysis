BENGALURU: The SSLC Board will remove the word ‘repeater’ from the markscards of students who’ve failed and are appearing for supplementary examinations. 

 Though the board started the initiative last year, the percentage of students who appeared for supplementary examinations was less, said V Sumangala, director (examinations), KSEEB.
 
 “We did not popularize the initiative enough last year, which is why the percentage of students who took supplementary examinations became less. We don’t want them to drop out from schools, but continue with higher education. This year, we have reissued the circular again. Their markscards will not mention that they are ‘repeaters’. They can continue to apply in colleges without feeling ashamed,” she said.
 
 As many as 1,62,943 students failed this year. Of 70,232 repeaters who appeared for SSLC in 2018, 20,489 (29.17%) passed. The last date for applying for supplementary examinations is May 19.
