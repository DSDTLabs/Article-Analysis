Actress   says she was not convinced she was suited to do action roles until she starred in ' '.According to reports, the 37-year-old starred as Psylocke in the 2016 superhero film, and Munn said the experience has given her a thirst for more action roles.

 "I really didn't realise how much I loved doing it until I actually was training for 'X-Men'," told Munn, when asked what attracts her to do action parts. 
 
 She added, "When I signed on for 'X-Men', I wasn't sure if I wanted to do it and I was talking to (screenwriter)  , and he was like, 'This is the introduction of the character, so it's going to be a smaller part and for this movie...'
 
 "And I said, 'Well, that's cool as long as you could just have a fight scene'. And to me, I grew up loving her so I know that they really didn't do her justice the first time that she was introduced. And I'd watched it and I was like, 'This is stupid'. The first time I saw it, I thought, 'You have to give her more.'"
 
 However, Munn said that she did not initially appreciate just how much hard work was needed to star in an action film.
