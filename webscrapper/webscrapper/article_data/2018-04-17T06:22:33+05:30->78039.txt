JAISALMER: Four days after the bodies of three teenagers — two girls and a boy — were found hanging from a tree in a village in Rajasthan’s   district, local police on Monday ruled out rape and murder as alleged by the girls’ families.

 Senior police officials said postmortem reports and circumstantial evidences suggested it was a case of suicides over a “failed love affair”.
 
 The girls, who were cousins and belonged to the Meghwal community, were in a relationship with the boy from a Sindhi-Muslim family of their village, police said. The trigger point for taking the extreme step was that the families of the boy and the elder girl had recently fixed their marriages with different persons, police added.
 
 The two girls, aged around 13 years and 12 years, and the boy ( ), aged about 17 years, were found hanging from a tree at a village under Binjrad police station of Barmer’s Chohatan tehsil on April 13 morning. Father of one of the girls lodged a police complaint the same day, accusing the deceased boy and one of his minor friends of rape and murder. Deputy SP (Chohatan circle)   told   on Monday, “The postmortem reports say that all three died of hanging and there were no injury marks on their bodies. The girls were neither raped nor were they pregnant,” he said adding that the three were in a ‘love relationship’ for over two years.
