NAGPUR: The   (FRA), Maharashtra, has threatened to go on strike from February 13 if the culprits behind the attack on forest officials taking on sand mafia are not arrested.

 In a memorandum to PCCF (head of forest force)   on Thursday, FRA president KV Bolke and secretary AR Deokar demanded a CID probe in the matter. Over 900 RFOs may join the strike and it would mean protection going haywire, they said.
 
 Ram Nagar police station in Chandrapur has registered an FIR against nine accused but only two have been arrested. The foresters have alleged that the others are not being arrested as they have political connections. “One of the accused,  , who beat up ACF  , is said to have close links to the BJP,” said sources.
 
 Five forest personnel, including three officers, were beaten up, robbed and abducted at gunpoint by sand smugglers, whom they had intercepted near Ajaypur on Mul Road around February 6 midnight.
 
 The assailants also snatched the service pistol of ACF Talmale and used it against the officials. The assailants made forest officials hold currency notes and clicked their photos, damaged their vehicle and forced them to sign a statement that they (foresters) had taken action out of their jurisdiction and sought bribe from attackers.
 
 In another development, Maharashtra State Gazetted Forest Officers Association, Nagpur, in a letter to state chief minister   has demanded a high level probe into the attack.
 
 They also demanded a stringent policy against sand mafia attacking foresters. Earlier, there have been incidents where even revenue department officials were targeted by the mafia.
