CHANDIGARH: The   and   high court has directed the principal secretary of Punjab department of rural development and panchayats to take a decision on entitlement of sarpanchs to honorarium with effect from July 2013.

 A division bench of the   comprising Justice   Mittal and Justice A S Grewal passed these orders on Monday while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by RTI activist Parvinder Singh Kittna of   district, seeking directions for the state to release the honorarium to sarpanchs with effect from July 2013 at the rate of Rs 1,200 per month.
 
 He said a number of sarpanchs in Punjab belonged to the scheduled castes (SC), and couldnâ€™t afford to discharge their functions, including entertaining government officers, without getting honorarium.
 
 The petitioner alleged that he had served a legal notice on the state government on January 15, 2016, in response to which the joint director of the panchayats department replied to the counsel that an amount of Rs 5.90 lakh had been sanctioned for the period from 2013-2016 for disbursement to sarpanchs in the Hoshiarpur district.
 
 However, the amount was not given to sarpanchs and had been diverted to some other purpose. The petitioner served another demand notice on the state authorities on July 7, 2017. The notice had neither been responded to yet nor had the amount been paid to sarpanchs.
 
 Hearing that, the bench issued directions to the principal secretary, department of rural development and panchayats, to decide legal notice regarding entitlement of sarpanches to honorarium with effect from July 2013, by passing a speaking order on the issue.
