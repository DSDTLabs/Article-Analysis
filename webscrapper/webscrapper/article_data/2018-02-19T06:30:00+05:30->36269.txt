Kolkata:   FC wanted to bring in   as soon as possible but the star striker is still awaiting the required paperwork to come back and play in India. “Chidi has agreed to all our terms and conditions and his contract is also ready but his visa hasn’t been approved yet,” said a source close to the team management.

 Not only the AFC Cup, the team management wanted the former East Bengal and Mohun Bagan star for the last few matches of the  , too, in the hope that he will help them finish in the fourth spot. But now it’s not certain as when he can join the team.
 
 Moreover, even if Chidi does arrive before their home match against Indian Arrows on Friday, there will not be much that he can do to help them finish fourth. That is because Bagan beat NEROCA FC on Sunday and are currently in the fourth spot with 24 points from 15 matches. Aizawl, on the other hand, are six points behind Bagan, having played a match less.
 
 According to the source, the team management has also decided to let go both Yugo Kabayashi and   within a few days’ time. Nurain did a good job for Aizawl FC in the centreback position, along with Masih Saighani, but he was badly injured during the match against NEROCA FC and has been out of the team since then.
 
 Meanwhile, Japan’s Kobayashi, who was brought into the team by their earlier coach Paulo Menezes, has been a huge flop for the northeast side, scoring only four goals from nine matches. While the midfield trio of Andrei Ionescu, David Lalrinmuana and Albert Zohmingmawia kept on creating chances, Kobayashi kept messing things up.
 
 The Japanese striker also picked up a knee injury recently and was not part of the team that played against Indian Arrows last Friday. He has also not travelled to Shillong with the team and will instead go back to Aizawl.
 
 While Chidi is coming as the fourth foreigner in place Nurain, the team scouts are still looking for an Aisan player in place of Kobayashi.
