 The  , who have been organising ramlila since last 12 years in the city, are organising the event on the Swachh Bharat theme this year. Organised at Site 4 Ground, Greater Noida, the stage has been decorated with a 30-feet high Gandhi chashma which has Swachh Bharat written on it. Two 35-feet high brooms are also placed on both sides of the stage. The ramlila that began on September 21 will conclude on September 30. Bijender Singh Arya, general secretary of the committee, says, "Keeping our surroundings clean is important and citizens should share this responsibility with the government. We thought the ramlila manch, where thousands of people gather every day, would be the best place to promote our initiative." Bijender adds, "The stage that we have set up is 250 feet high and it is beautifully decorated. The idea was to build a high stage so that people, who would stand in the back, could also see all the scenes clearly." Harinder Bhati, a resident of Greater Noida, says, "The theme of this year's ramlila is very relatable. Ramlila is the perfect way to spread the message of keeping our city clean. As citizens, we must follow our PM's Swachh Bharat initiative and must ensure that our surroundings remain clean."
