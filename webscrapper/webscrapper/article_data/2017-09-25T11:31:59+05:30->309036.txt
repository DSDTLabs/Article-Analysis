Actor   said she has had to "pull" her friend Cara   away from people on night-outs because of the model-turned-actor's fiery temper. 

  
  
 The 'Big Little Lies' star said loves hanging out with Delevingne but admits that her temper can get them into trouble. "Cara? That girl is the bomb. She's fiery, she might be more fiery than I am. I've had to pull her off people," said Kravitz. 
 
 The 28-year-old actor said she can also get a little angry, which sometimes offends fans. "I have a fiery side. I can be confrontational. Like, it's nice to meet you but if I'm having a bad day or I'm eating a burrito on my way back from the gym and you're not aware of my space and not treating me like a real person, then, 'No, I don't want a photo with you' doesn't mean I'm an a******," she said.
