MEERUT: When 12-year-old Chirag   is asked to multiply 42,225 by 645, it takes him about half a second to reply “2,72,35,125”. In mathematical prowess reminiscent of the famed Shakuntala Devi, this Class VIII prodigy from  , a remote village in UP’s   district, takes even less time to add numbers that run into lakhs and crores. Hailed as a “wonder kid” in the entire district, Chirag’s ability to add, subtract and multiply numbers, up to 20 crore so far, is only strengthening, his teachers claim.

 Sensing the “extraordinary gift” that this labourer’s son has been blessed with, Chirag’s school authorities have appointed a special mathematics teacher who is helping him cover the subject up to Class XII. Not surprisingly, the child has shown no signs of difficulty.  , principal of  , said that teachers first noticed Chirag’s special powers when he was in Class IV. “Even during that time, he was far ahead of his schoolmates and teachers,"   said.
 
  
  
 
 Since   comes from an underprivileged family with a father, Narender Rathi, who works as a labourer at a construction site and is the sole breadwinner for his family of four, school authorities have waived the young genius’s fees and have been providing free books to him. Asked how he is able to calculate so quickly, Chirag told TOI, "Numbers are fun. The answers just come to me naturally. My peers often accuse me of using a special technique or formula, but I don’t have any of that."
