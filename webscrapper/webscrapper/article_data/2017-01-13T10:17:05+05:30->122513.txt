  The father still runs a cycle repair shop in his native village of Fatehpur Rajputa in Sanaur. Mann is surprised to find how closely his father has been following AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s Punjab tour in newspapers. Mann told TOI, “The days of struggle are still not over for our family.

He has been repairing cycles for 45 years.”
