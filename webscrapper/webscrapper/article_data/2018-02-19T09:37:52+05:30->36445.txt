BHOPAL: The state public service exams continue to be bogged in controversies.

 This time it was the prelims of the Public Service Commission (PSC) exams when a candidate was allowed to appear for a paper at a centre which he was not assigned. Consequently, a show-cause notice has been issued to two invigilators.
 
 The incident took place when candidate  , who was assigned Sarojini Naidu Girls School as his centre, reached the   instead which is adjacent to the school. He was, however, allowed to write the paper.
 
 By the time the invigilators realised their mistake, Sharma had already finished his paper. They informed the centre in-charge and principal of the college. College principal Dr   informed the higher authorities in this regard.
 
 “The candidate was asked to go to Sarojini Naidu School for the second paper organised on the day. It is a big mistake done on the part of the invigilators. I have informed the PSC and other higher authorities,” said Dr Sharma.
 
 She added that since both invigilators were from her college, an explanation has also been sought from them.
 
 State civil service preliminary exam, conducted by Public Service Commission (PSC), were organised at 56 centres in   division. There were 660 centres across the state for the exam. Around 2.5 lakh candidates across the state appeared for the exam.
