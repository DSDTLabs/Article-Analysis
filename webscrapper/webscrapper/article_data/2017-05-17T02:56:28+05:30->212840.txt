GHAZIABAD: The UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Tuesday issued notices to several housing societies and market complexes in   areas asking them to raise the chimney heights of diesel-run gensets, so that toxic exhaust fumes do not directly enter houses or roads. Directions have also been issued to install acoustic enclosures around gensets to curb noise pollution.

 The notices contain guidelines for the use of heavy-duty gensets in the city. The majority of notices have been issued in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and  , where the UPPCB recently conducted a survey to ascertain if genset usage norms were being properly followed. “Those who do not follow the directions will be penalised,” UPPCB regional officer, Paras Nath, told TOI.
 
 Usage of gensets has gone up considerably in   over the past fortnight due to frequent power cuts.
