NEW DELHI: The Centre's fiscal deficit in the first quarter of the current financial year shot up to 80.8% of the full year target compared to 61.1% in the year-earlier period but economists said it was not alarming as the government had front-loaded spending.

 Separate data showed growth in the eight key infrastructure sectors slowed to a 19-month low, dragged down by contraction in coal, cement, refinery product and fertilizers. Data showed the core sector sector grew an annual 0.4% in June, below 7% recorded in June 2016 and lower than previous month's 4.1% expansion.Crude oil, natural gas, steel and electricity posted modest gains. The sector accounts for 40.3% of IIP. The June data does not augur well for the   data for the month, which will be released later in August.
 
 The government had advanced the budget date by a month to ensure that spending kicks off from April, the start of the financial year. Data released by the   on Monday showed the deficit stood at 4.42 lakh crore at the end of April-June quarter.
 
 "The sharp year-on-year rise in the government's fiscal and revenue deficits in Q1FY-18 is not a source of alarm, with up-fronting of budget presentation and expenditure pattern making the data incomparable," said  , principal economist at ratings agency  . "In particular, the robust 40% year-on-year expansion in the government's capital expenditure in Q1 FY-18 is encouraging," Nayar said. The government plans to rein in the deficit at 3.2% of GDP in the current fiscal, lower than previous year's 3.5%.
 
 Nayar said despite a modest tax revenue growth recorded in June, which was driven by year-on-year stagnation of excise duty receipts and mild dip in corporation tax inflows, the overall expansion of net tax revenues in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year was healthy.
