GHAZIABAD: The project to establish the first direct metro link between Noida and Ghaziabad seems to be fast gaining momentum.

 The detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed metro line from Noida Sector 62 to Vaishali via Indirapuram and Mohan Nagar is in the final stages and   Rail Corporation ( ) is expected to submit the DPR by January-end, officials said.
 
 “We are expecting the DPR, which is being prepared by the DMRC, will be submitted to the GDA by January 31,” V N Singh, chief engineer of Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 “As per initial information shared by the DMRC, there will be four stations from Noida Sector 62 to Mohan Nagar, which will bifurcate Indirapuram along CISF Road, and four stations between Vaishali and Mohan Nagar via Vasundhara,” he added.
 
 
  
 But instead of Mohan Nagar, Vasundhara will serve as transit point for the extended metro project. 
 
 Once the DPR is submitted and the tentative cost of the project becomes clear, it will be sent to the government for its approval, officials said.
 
 The total length of the corridor will be 9.5km with Vaishali to Mohan Nagar stretch being 5km long, while the stretch from Noida Sector 62 to Mohan Nagar via Vaishali will be 4.5km long. 
 
 A portion of land which is located near DPS Indirapuram school will serve as the yard station.
 
 The GDA board had given its approval for the project in April 2016 and sanctioned Rs 1.09 crore to the DMRC for preparation of DPR, out of which the development body has already paid Rs 32 lakh. 
 
 In the board meeting, it was decided that the Ghaziabad Development Authority will either get the fund for the project from its infrastructure fund or will take loan from NCR Planning board, but the final decision wrest with state government.
 
 This extended corridor would bring the trans-Hindon areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara under the metro route. 
 
 This will also enhance connectivity with Noida for commuters.
