Chandigarh: A   on the mouth of a bicycle track in Sector 11-B that goes towards the Sector 10 dividing road is broken for a few months now.

 The sign is falling to the right, uprooted partially from the base, somewhat leaning over the bicycle track. The people who use the bicycle track on a regular basis and even the nearby residents said the sign was a distraction and they had reported it to the municipal corporation. Anupama, one of the joggers from the area, said: “The sign is in the open and visible to everyone, including the MC. It looks ugly and awkward.”
 
 “I have observed it reclining to for a long time now but the civic body took no action to get it repaired,” said Robin Chandel, a passerby. “This should not be a very difficult job for the MC, and can be taken care of pretty easily. The sign looks embarrassingly out of place in the surroundings.”
 
 When TOI asked a number of other people, none recalled ever reporting it to the MC, although a few of them admitted to have tried to push it back to its original position.
