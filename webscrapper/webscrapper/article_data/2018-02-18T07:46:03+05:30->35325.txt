NEW DELHI:   may be faced with US sanctions but that did not come in the way of India looking to further ramp up its economic ties with Tehran with focus on connectivity, energy, trade and investment when PM   met Iranian President   here on Saturday. The two countries signed nine agreements, including a lease contract which will allow an Indian company to take over for 18 months operational control of facilities at Shahid Beheshti Port in Chabahar.

 
 Thanking Rouhani for   development, Modi said India will support construction of the Chabahar-Zahedan rail link in Iran to allow Chabahar gateway's potential to be fully utilised.
 
 We want to expand connectivity, cooperation in the energy sector and the centuries-old bilateral relationship, said Modi.
 
 The port project is important for India as it will allow it to bypass Pakistan in accessing not just Afghanistan but also central Asian countries. The agreement is also a message to the US that India remains committed to Chabahar despite the US threat to tighten sanctions on Iran.
 
 India and Iran also signed an agreement for avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion "with respect to taxes on income".
 
 Amid growing bonhomie with Israel, India is hoping that Rouhani's visit and also Modi's own recent visit to Palestine will help dispel the notion that its West Asia policy is no longer on an even keel. For trade and investment, the two leaders recognised the need to put in place an effective banking channel.
