COLVA: A 22-year-old jet-ski helper was pulled into the sea by strong currents after he fell into the water while manoeuvring his boat for rescue operation during a para-sailing activity at Colva, Friday afternoon.

 Engaged by   a fortnight ago, Anil Shankar Pawar, a native of Bijapur, was earlier employed with an operator in Calangute. His body was washed ashore at Varca late evening.
 
 His employer, Cosme   said, “I was helping tourists wear safety gears while Pawar was steering the boat for rescue operation, which is a standard operating procedure during para-sailing. Just then, a   lifeguard raised an alarm saying that Anil had fallen into the sea after being hit by a strong wave.”
 
 “Perhaps he must have lost his grip over the handlebar with the impact of the wave and the same must have hit his head, rendering him unconscious,” Fernandes said.
 
 “Without wasting time, with the help of Drishti lifeguards, we began search for him, but to no avail,” he added. Coastal police and   helicopters also joined the search operation, but could not trace the body.
 
 Following today’s mishap, tourism minister Manohar   sought a report within 24 hours on the incident from department officials and Drishti Lifeguard Services. He also warned of stern action against unauthorized watersports operators.
 
 Azgaonkar said that officials of the department of tourism should work with responsibility and accountability. The minister had recently convened a meeting at the tourism department seeking a report on the operation of all such activities under the Tourism Trade Act. He has proposed to re-convene an urgent meeting in this regard.
