If the unconfirmed cases are considered, over 70 patients have displayed the symptoms of swine flu and received treatment this year. The flu virus had last hit Gurgaon in 2014 and infected 34 people. This year, 239 people have been infected in the state till now, out of which nine lost their lives.
 
 The state health department has identified a gene mutation in H1N1 which is causing the outbreak earlier than usual. “Our biologists have noticed a gene mutation in H1N1 and suspect it is the Michigan strain. There are two types of strain — one for winter, California strain, which we had earlier and one for summer, Michigan strain,” said Dr  , director, state health department.
