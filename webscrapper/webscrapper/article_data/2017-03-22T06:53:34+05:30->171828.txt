PANAJI:   on Tuesday directed   to take stringent action against those involved in crime, especially the drug trade and atrocities against women.

 Parrikar on Tuesday held two meetings with the police to understand their requirements. While the BJP had attacked the previous Congress government of supporting the drug trade, from 2012-2017 the BJP-government came under severe criticism for not doing enough to weed out the drug mafia. 
 
 During the first meeting Parrikar met   (DGP) Muktesh Chander along with   (IGP) and   (DIGs). The second meeting saw Parrikar interact with DGP and   (SPs) to get firsthand information about the crime scenario in the state.
 
 After the meeting Parrikar told TOI, “I have told the police that they should not compromise on crime against women and there should be no crime and drugs in the state.”
 
 He also said that after presenting the budget, he will inititate police transfers. Parrikar is likely to transfer SPs next week.
 
 “The aim of the meeting was to refamiliarise myself with the police department and understand who is doing what,” he added.
 
 Parrikar inquired about the deputy superintendent (DySP) vacancies that need to be filled so that police inspectors are promoted to the rank of DySP.
 
 Former DySP Lavoo Mamledar told TOI that the first thing the government should do is direct the police department to register crimes. 
 
 Mamledar added that another task ahead of the government directing the police not to harass the complainant. If these two things are done on priority then people will have faith in the police.
 
 The Goa government has to immediately take steps to improve the functioning of the Goa police by providing additional vehicles for round-the-clock patrolling, provide the latest weapon to counter any terror attacks as the state is always on high alert.
 
 The main task before the government is to pass the Goa Police Reforms Bill which has been gathering dust for the last 10 years.
