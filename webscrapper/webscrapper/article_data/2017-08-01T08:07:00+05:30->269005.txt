JAIPUR: The   (JMC) officials have initiated the process of releasing second installment of funds for construction of toilets in  . The officials have approached the residents of the colony, a slum near Bani Park, in this regard.

 The action follows a TOI report ‘Swachh Bharat Mission yet to take off in city’ published on July 27.
 
 Officials have listed names of residents to process the installment of Rs 4,000 in their accounts. According to volunteers working in that area, JMC engineers visited their colony, collected necessary data and assured of transferring money in their bank accounts.
 
 At the Sootmill Colony, out of 450 households 350 have constructed toilets. Not a single household in the slum, however, has received the third and final instalment of the incentive/subsidy. Only 150 households have received the first instalment of Rs 4,000. The issue was reported by TOI after which civic body sprang into action.
 
 The toilet subsidy is transferred to the beneficiary in three installments of Rs 4,000 each. The first installment comes from the Central government, second from the state government and the third from the   (ULB). The third installment that is funded by the ULB has not been released to anyone in Jaipur.
 
 Along with it some 80 households that do not have individual toilets as they are tenants, for them JMC has installed four single seated community toilets. “Four have been installed while two more have been approved by JMC on July 28. There was demand for eight but for now even six are good. With community toilets in place, Sootmill Colony will become the   (ODF) slum,” said a volunteer.
 
 Residents themselves have taken up the responsibility to ensure that community toilet remain clean and are maintained properly. A group of women from the locality has vowed to confirm that only those households that do not have individual toilets will use the community toilets.
