GURUGRAM: Property dealer Rajkumar (47), who was   dead in Sector 69 on Monday night, had fired at his assailants in self-defence during the attack, before falling to the killers’ bullets, police investigation has revealed. The police have recovered Rajkumar’s licensed pistol from the spot.

 “The property dealer was carrying his licensed pistoled and had fired five rounds in self-defence,” DCP (south)   told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 Bakshi visited the spot in the day and questioned  , the owner of the house where Rajkumar had taken shelter. But he claimed that he and his family woke up only after hearing the gunshots and they did not know the victim or the assailants. Local people were also quizzed in the day in this regard.
 
 The police also suggested that Rajkumar could have managed to escape during the attack, had he not been drunk. 
 
 Four-five men, in a black car, had started following Rajkumar’s S-cross near   temple just ahead Badshapur around 11pm. When he sensed that some people were following him, he accelerated his car’s speed but rammed his car into a divider.
 
 Rajkumar, who had received a couple of bullets in the initial attack, managed to get out of the car and hide in an empty room at Ram’s house in Sector 69. But, he apparently forgot to lock the door of the room properly, said the police. And, the assailants hunted him down, following the bloodstains along the way.
 
 However, the police are yet to arrest any of the eight accused named in the FIR. Deepak Kumar (24), whose father   was murdered around 20 years ago, has been booked as the main accused in this case. Rajkumar, alias Raju, was allegedly involved in Brahma’s murder.
 
 “The accused are absconding but our teams are conducting raids. They will be arrested soon,” DCP Bakshi added.
