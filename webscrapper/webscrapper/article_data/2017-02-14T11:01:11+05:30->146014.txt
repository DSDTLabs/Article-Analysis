SURAT: Cops in   police station have had a change of heart towards the persons arrested on different charges. 

 Ever since an accused committed suicide in front of their eyes in the lockup in November 2016, policemen have been taking risk and keeping the accused outside of the lockup during night hours. 
 
 The cops don’t want another person to commit suicide in the lockup, but the accused’s heart has still not begin to overflow with love for the men in khakhi. Hence, they are trying to make the most of the changed scenario like an attempt to murder accused who escaped from the police station on Friday despite being in handcuff and tied to a writing table. 
 
 Guddu Pandey, an accused in an attempt to murder case, escaped from the police station after successfully removing the handcuff which was tied to his one hand and a leg of the table.
 
 The lockup of Pandesara police station is located in a corner and not visible to the police staff. Police officials say they will be in a better position to take action only when the lockup is clearly visible to them. 
 
 Pravin Indrajeet, 22, had tried many times during his 45 minute struggle to hang himself in the lockup before succeeding in the night of November 7, 2016. The incident was captured by CCTV cameras but the video was visible on the screen in an officer’s chamber who unfortunately was not present that time. 
 
 Police officials now say there is a need to install additional CCTV cameras to keep a watch on the accused inside and outside the lockups of the police station.
