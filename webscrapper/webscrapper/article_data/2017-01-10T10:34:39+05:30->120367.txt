JALALBAD: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   said there was no reason for Punjabis to believe in the Congress’s manifesto released on Monday because the party had never implemented any of its previous manifestos.

 Addressing public gatherings at Mandi Roraan Waali, Hauz Khas, Veroke and Chak Aria Wala in   constituency, from where he is contesting, Sukhbir said, “Congress has become a party of thugs who get together on election eve only to befool and loot Punjabis. Whatever has been announced today will be consigned to the dustbin tomorrow.”
 
 He claimed that Congress and its Punjab president,  , had never kept their word earlier too. “In the manifesto for 2002 elections too, Amarinder had promised to retain free power provided to farmers by my father and our CM, Parkash Singh Badal. He, however, discontinued it immediately after coming to power,” he said, adding that all such social welfare schemes had been stopped by Amarinder at that time. “He is promising to provide lakhs of jobs to youth, but had banned recruitment on becoming CM,” the deputy CM said
 
 Sukhbir also took on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann, who is contesting against him from Jalalabad. “He is a comedian who works for money. During my parliamentary campaign in Faridkot earlier, he took Rs 4 lakh from me to sing my praises before I reached the stage. Such comedians will lose their security deposit in Jalalabad,” he said.
