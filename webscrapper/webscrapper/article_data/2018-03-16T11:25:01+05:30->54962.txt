HYDERABAD: The state government’s allocation for priority sectors appears to be high, but the actual spending is low. The government had earmarked Rs 25,000 crore for the irrigation sector in the last budget, just like in the proposed budget for 2018-19, but it could not spend even half of it.

 According to statistics available with the irrigation department and finance department, against Rs 25,000 crore, till March first week, Rs 11,200 crore was spent. Of the expenditure, about 50 per cent funds were given to the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) while other irrigation projects were allocated any fund. The government wants to partially complete KLIP by June-end this year to release water in some areas.
 
 “In the previous budget, Rs 6,740 crore was allocated for Kaleshwaram project and the expenditure was Rs 4,300 crore. While the allocation for the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy project was Rs 4,000 crore, about Rs 1,600 crore was spent. Another major project, the Sripada Yellampally Irrigation Scheme, Rs 400 crore was earmarked but only Rs 120 crore was spent. Similarly, the   in Adilabad was given Rs 1,590 crore but only Rs 390 crore was spent,” sources in the government said.
 
 Opposition parties alleged that state government is not emphasising on the completion of projects started by the  . In the current budget, the state has earmarked Rs 2,160 crore for completing them but spent only Rs 1,300 crore till now.
 
 Officials said projects could not be completed due to land acquisition issues, court cases and permissions from the Centre or other departments.
