BHOPAL: Blaming opium smugglers and Congress workers for farmers’ protest, the state BJP leadership held a close-door meeting at the regional party office on Thursday to chalk out a strategy to pacify farmers ahead of the national president Amit Shah’s visit between August 18 and 20. 

 The closed-door meeting continued for three hours. It was presided over by state party chief   Chauhan, organisation general secretary   and other state office-bearers. “We have planned detailed programmes for party chief Amit Shah’s three-day tour and a day’s visit by NDA presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind on July 8. We have made elaborate arrangements for both the programmes, which are being kept secret,” said   Singh while talking to reporters after the meeting.
 
 Regarding Mandsaur violence and farmers’ unrest, the state BJP chief said that police have identified some opium smugglers involved in provoking violence in the district and names are likely to come out soon. He said names of two Congress MLAs involved in the farmers' agitation have also been disclosed.
 
 The BJP chief however, did not reveal names of the Congress MLAs, but claimed that what party leaders had anticipated came out to be true. Opium smugglers active in the region were involved in inciting violence while Congress MLAs added fuel to it, he said.
 
 On Kovind's visit, Nandkumar said that elaborate arrangements have been made to welcome NDA's presidential candidate Kovind on July 8. More than 5,000 workers and leaders would meet Kovind during his one-day visit, he said.
 
 “NDA presidential candidate Kovind is arriving on July 8 to appeal to MLAs and MPs to vote for him. We have extended full support to him and would organise a grand welcome for him”, said Nandkumar Singh.
