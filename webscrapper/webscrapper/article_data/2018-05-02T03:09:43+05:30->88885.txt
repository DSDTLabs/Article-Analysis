NEW DELHI: The   expressed concern on Tuesday over the lack of enthusiasm among governments to pursue cases of electoral malpractices registered by the   while conducting polls and sought answers from the Union government. 

 
 A bench of Justices N V   and S Abdul Nazeer said serious poll offences like huge seizures of cash and theft of EVM machines get registered by the EC during elections. But, as soon as a new government takes over, there is no mechanism for the EC to ensure prosecution of the alleged offenders in the absence of lack of enthusiasm from governments, it said Case in hand related to a seizure of Rs 20 lakh in cash, loose cheque leaves and other material allegedly for use during the 2014 Lok Sabha bypolls to Bellary (now Ballari). 
 
 Though the EC had registered a criminal case, the state government took no effective steps for prosecution and the accused moved the HC for quashing of the FIR citing lack of prosecution. The HC later quashed the FIR. Appearing for the   government, additional advocate general Devadatt Kamat said the issues raised by the   in its September 5 order last year had wider ramifications as these went to the root of the integrity of elections, which are vital for sustenance of democracy. 
 
 “In cases relating to theft of EVMs, the EC should play an important role in ensuring prosecution of offenders as EVMs are property of EC,” he said, suggesting that the EC could have a nodal officer to pursue such cases after electioneering is concluded. In last year’s September 5 order, the bench headed by Justice Ramana had said: “We are informed that numerous criminal cases relating to crimes committed during elections are not being pursued effectively as the prosecution is completely left for the state machinery... it would be appropriate that the Election Commission places before this court all the guidelines framed in this regard concerning the procedures to be followed by the flying squads, or similar authorities with respect to search, seizure and prosecution of other criminal matters involving elections.”
