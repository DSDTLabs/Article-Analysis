MUMBAI: Taking note of TOI's report of Thursday on how   is likely to face flooding yet again this monsoon, the opposition in the   criticised the administration and asked it to spell out the reason for delays in storm water drain (SWD) augmentation work in the area. 

 Civic officials blamed the delays on 66 large trees that have roots in the paths of the drains. They said the challenge is to make way for new pipes without harming the trees. "The delays are occurring because we are not cutting the roots, but realigning them," said an official.
 
 At a civic standing committee meeting on Friday, opposition leader Ravi Raja, referring to the TOI report 'Hindmata set to flood yet again despite BMC's 'best efforts'' questioned the administration on why it didn't take up the SWD augmentation project on priority. "First, the BMC kept saying that once built, the Britannia storm water pumping station would provide relief to Hindmata. Well, nothing happened even after the pumping station's construction. Now SWD discharge capacities are being increased. Why could this work not be taken up earlier?" asked Raja. The work started only in February. The BMC said on Thursday that only 200 metres of the planned 800 metre SWD work can be over before the rains start about a fortnight from now (according to forecasts).
 
 "We should be able to ensure that there is relief from waterlogging in the area next year. This time we would have to bear with it," said   from the BMC's SWD department. Reacting to it,   corporator   said the administration cannot make such casual statements. "Why are efforts not being made to ensure that waterlogging does not occur at all?" he said angrily.
