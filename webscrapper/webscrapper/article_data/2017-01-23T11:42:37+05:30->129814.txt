MUMBAI: Following an unfortunate incident in the gates, favourite Temerity had failed to put up the kind of performances that were expected of her in the Indian 1000 Guineas last month. Her performances had left her followers and her rider   hugely disappointed, but on Sunday, this   - trainee made up for that in style when she cruised to a comfortable victory in the Villoo Poonawalla   (Grade 1), the third Classic of the season.

 Neeraj had kept Temerity, third favourite (132) in third or fourth position not far away from leader Book Thief till the heads turned for home. Tracking her closely was   on favourite Mrs Patmore. When the field straightened up in the home stretch, Temerity simply moved with fabulous strides and landed an easy victory with Mrs Patmore finishing second 2-14 lengths behind.   finished creditable third. Winter Renaissance improved tremendously to finish fourth.
 
 “It was indeed disappointing in the 1000 Guineas as I was very confident but all that is history now and we are here enjoying our time under the sun,” said 30-year-old Rawal after claiming his first ever India Classic in 13-year-old career. “Once we were set out, I knew my filly is in great heart and never had any doubt about her ability,” added Neeraj, who is having a fantastic time this season by notching up wins in Hyderabad Oaks and Bangalore 1000 Guineas.
 
 Temerity is owned by RWITC managing committee member Shyam Ruia, a veteran owner and respected administrator. “I owe my success to Ruia sir who always encouraged me and stood by me all the time,” said Neeraj. 
 
 Berjis Desai is co-owner of the victorious filly.
