Panaji: A database of eco clubs operational in all schools across the state is being created by the Goa state council for science and technology. These clubs will be provided Rs 5,000 each to work and create awareness about solid waste management and other environment related activities.

 This month, three workshops are being held for one science subject teacher from each of the institutions across various talukas of the state, where they will be provided training on the activities to be carried out as part of the functioning of these eco clubs. 
 
 Once the database of eco clubs is created, it will be used to network between these clubs.
 
 “The state council is preparing a database for school eco clubs to facilitate the networking of all the school eco clubs together for coordinating activities and to bring out a small quarterly bulletin of the eco club activities,” schools have been told in a circular issued by the directorate of education (DoE).
 
 Eco clubs of each school will be asked to choose an area of its interest to focus on.
