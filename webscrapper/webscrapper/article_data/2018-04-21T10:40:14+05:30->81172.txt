LUCKNOW: Raw material for school uniforms which the government provides to students may soon come from UP Handloom. Cabinet minister   has said that he will soon be writing to chief minister  , recommending that the raw material for school uniforms for government school students be purchased from UP Handloom or Uttar Pradesh Industrial Cooperative Association Ltd (UPICA). 

 "I think this will be a good idea to boost handlooms and power looms in the state. We will be giving a proposal to the CM to consider purchasing material from these two corporations. We discussed this issue in the Board meeting held on Friday and I was told that there is sufficient supply to meet the demand for school uniforms," said Pachauri, minister for micro, small and medium industries.
 
 He added that the cloth purchased from the corporations may be a little expensive when compared with other outlets but in the long run it would help in boosting local industry within the state. In UP, the government issues tenders for uniform procurement. Claiming that no one organisation had the capacity to supply uniforms for students across the state due to their extremely large numbers, the education department had asked each district to issue their own tenders last year. New uniforms are given to new enrolments while other students are permitted a change after every three years.
 
 "We have been working hard to make the corporations profitable. Trade unions have had a terrible impact on the working within these organisations and since I have taken over, we have had to work systematically to cut out  . To a large extent we have succeeded and offered employees rewards if they performed well," he said.
