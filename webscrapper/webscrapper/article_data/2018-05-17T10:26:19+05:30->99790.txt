In a major embarrassment to Pune-based Maharashtra   ( ), certificates issued to over 5,000 candidates qualifying the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) 2017 have been recalled due to a technical error. 

 The certificates, printed with the help of a private agency, failed to mention the candidates’ optional subject. 
 
 MSCE commissioner Sukhdev Dere on Wednesday said that orders have been issued to educational officers from each district to issue fresh certificates to successful candidates in lieu of the old one. 
 
 “The paper II of TET had optional subjects in the form of Social Science and Mathematics-Science. However, the certificates issued do not mention the optional subject with which the candidate cleared the examination. It is blunder which needs to be corrected,” he said. 
 
 MSCE authorities said private agency concerned has to bear entire re-printing and re-distribution expenses. 
 
 “Candidates need to carry original and photocopy of TET application form, hall-ticket and DTed/B.Ed certificate along with TET certificate issued earlier and online statement of mark for collecting corrected certificates. They also need to carry caste certificate and caste-validity certificate, if applicable along with photo identity card,” MSCE authorities said. 
 
  The goof-up in TET certificates has evoked sharp reactions in academic circle with stakeholders blaming MSCE for alleged casual approach in conduct of the examination. Student activist Rahul Tayde of   recalled typos that had appeared in TET question paper during the examination that was held during July last year. 
 
  The state government had notified the TET through government resolution issued on August 23, 2013. It was made mandatory for teaching aspirants willing to serve in educational institutes of all managements and mediums. The test, which was introduced in the light of RTE Act 2009, aims to identify quality primary teachers.
