 was floored by the beauty of Rishikesh as he shot there recently for  's 'Kareeb Kareeb Single' for a nearly a week. 

  Irrfan, who was accompanied by wife   and elder son Babil, spent time soaking in the scenic beauty of the place and relishing the local cuisine in his free time. 
 
 "Irrfan ji thoroughly enjoyed shooting in Rishikesh," informs Rati Shankar Tripathi, who helped with the shooting of the film. "Shooting ke baad aksar woh apne parivar aur mitron ke saath ghat pe samay bitaate thay. Unke ek mitr guitar laaye thay toh shaam ko aksar gaane ki mehfil bhi jam jati thi," informs Tripathi, who has also been seen in films like Gangs of Wasseypur and Bullett Raja.

  Portions of the film, that also stars south Indian actor Parvathy, were shot at the Parmarth Niketan Ganga Ghat in Rishikesh. The film is a love story of two travellers who meet along the way, and is expected to release later this year.
