RAMPUR: Senior   leader and former UP minister   has said that UP's Muslims have suffered due to differences between SP patriarch   and his son and former chief minister  . 

 Responding to reporters' questions on Mulayam's recent statement on his son Akhilesh, Khan said, "He (Mulayam) had been talking about these things for the past few days. The father and the son have had differences, but it's Muslims of the state who have suffered much due their differences."
 
 The Muslim face of SP added, "Those sitting in Delhi are responsible for the differences between the two leaders because they wanted to harm the community and they have achieved success in their mission."
 
 On Saturday, SP patriarch had launched a scathing attack on his son saying that Akhilesh had "humiliated and betrayed him". Mulayam had further said that Akhilesh doesn't pay him the due respect. "When he (Akhilesh) doesn't respect his father (Mulayam), how will people respect him?" Mulayam asked.
