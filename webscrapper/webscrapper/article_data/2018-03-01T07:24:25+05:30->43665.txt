HYDERABAD: The government may have assured hassle-free Intermediate examination, but on the first day itself differently-abled students had to face problems while entering the examination halls.

 In  , two differently abled students were helped by their friends across the stairs to enter the hall. The girls were carried on their wheelchairs by fellow students in the absence of any help from officials at the centre.
 
 
  
 “There was no staff or any official outside the hall. The fellow students had to carry the students as they were unable to climb the stairs,” said a witness. 
 In SR Nagar, few students were seen trying to spot their centre even at the last moment. Few students eventually missed the exam as they reached the wrong centre, that too after 9am.
 
 Many students were also irked that at some centres there were not allowed to carry even their exam pads inside the hall. They questioned the need for banning them.
 
 Education minister   organized a review meeting and enquired about preparations for both intermediate and class 10 examinations. He asked different departments to coordinate and conduct the exams smoothly.
 
 It is very unfortunate that many Intermediate students had to face problems on the first day of the examination. The board should ensure assistance to the differently-abled and also have uniform riles in place
