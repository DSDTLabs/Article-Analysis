HYDERABAD: It took   four attempts to secure a PhD seat in his dream university â€” the   (JNU) in New Delhi. But, sadly, his stint there lasted only seven months. The 25-year-old committed suicide in the national capital on Monday evening. 

 The research scholar's death sent shock waves across the   (UoH) campus, where he completed his MA and was pursing his MPhil before the JNU offer came through. On Tuesday, students at UoH held a condolence meet and recalled Muthukrishnan's involvement in the 'justice for  ' movement. 
 
 "It was Muthukrishnan's dream to get into JNU. I still remember how happy he was when he finally made the cut. He even quit his MPhil course halfway to join JNU," said Ishwar Bonula, associate professor in department of history, who was the research scholar's guide for two semesters.
 
 Apart from being an active member of the recent movement, Muthukrishnan was also an enthusiastic and hard working student. "Since he was so actively involved in several student movements, he even wanted to pursue research in the same subject. After the anti-JNU agitation that unfolded in 2016, where students played a crucial role, Muthukrishnan wanted to trace the movement in his research paper. But I had advised him to first check if enough resources were available for him to do the same," said Bonula.
 
 But getting into JNU wasn't Muthukrishnan's only ambition. He also wanted to learn several foreign languages and going abroad to study. "He was a first generation learner from his family. I had never imagined that someone who had such a strong personality would ever take such an extreme step," said Bonula.
