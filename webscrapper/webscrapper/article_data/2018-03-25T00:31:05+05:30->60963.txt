Trichy: Cricketer Dinesh Karthik’s heroics in the finals of the recently-concluded T20 tri-series against Bangladesh were a perfect example for students on how to make use of the opportunities when provided, justice S Baskaran of the Madras high court said here on Saturday. He was delivering the chief guest’s address at the 99th annual graduation day of National College. Pointing out several real life examples to motivate the students, justice Baskaran said that students should cultivate perseverance as an attribute and added that Karthik was a good example for youngsters. “He (Karthik) has been in and out of the Indian team over the last 14 years. And when the team’s and nation’s hopes banked on him in the final T20 match against Bangladesh, he took it as an opportunity to exhibit his talent and came out in flying colours,” he said. Baskaran, who himself is an alumnus of National College, also spoke about late Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi as another great example for determination. “Even though the legendary cricketer suffered a permanent damage in his right eye, he still continued to play cricket relying on just one eye and brought laurels to the country,” he pointed out.  The justice also said that college students should develop a patriotic feeling apart from focusing on individual growth. “Patriotism and commitment to family and society are the most important principles the young generation must possess,” he said. Further, he urged students to focus on becoming multi-faceted and develop several skills and not restrict them to just one domain. A total of 882 graduates including UG, PG and M Phil degrees were conferred – which included 22 university ranks and two gold medals.
