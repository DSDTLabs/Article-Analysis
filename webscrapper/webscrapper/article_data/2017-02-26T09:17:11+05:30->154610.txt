KOCHI:   Ignatius   has removed   from all   of the church.

 Mor Eusebius has been the metropolitan of Kothamangalam zonal diocese of  .
 
 While a section of the church said the removal of the metropolitan was on grounds of misconduct, others said the development was based on Mor Eusebius's request.
 
 He would, however, continue as the metropolitan of the zonal diocese.
 
 A pastoral letter on the removal of the metropolitan and the circumstances that led to it was likely to be read out in parishes under the Jacobite Syrian Church this Sunday or next week.
 
 "Kuriakose Mor Eusebius had earlier served as the metropolitan of Thrissur diocese. Following complaints from the laity about the misconduct of the metropolitan, he was shifted to Kothamangalam three years ago," a source with the church said.
 
 "While he enjoyed independent charge of the Thrissur diocese, he was given the charge of Kothamangalam, which is one of the zones under Angamaly diocese which is under the direct jurisdiction of Catholicos Baselios Thomas -I, the head of the Jacobite Church in the country," sources said.
 
 "In Kothamangalam also, the laity raised similar complaints against the metropolitan. The case was forwarded to the Patriarch. A 14-member metropolitans team, which included Kuriakose Mor Eusebius also, went to visit Patriarch in Beirut last month. It was after hearing Kuriakose Mor Eusebius that the Patriarch ordered to remove his administrative powers," he said.
 
 According to those close to Mor Eusebius, it was the metropolitan himself who requested for exempting him from the charges of the diocese.
 "Kuriakose Mor Eusebius had made this request at a recently concluded synod. So, it can't be considered as punishment," an official with the Church said. The church had given administrative charges of the zonal diocese to another metropolitan.
