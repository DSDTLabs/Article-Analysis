JAIPUR: In two separate incidents, a husband and a wife were killed by their spouses following spats over liquor consumption at   and   localities, respectively.

 At   village under Kardhani police station, 55-year-old Santosh Kanwar, who was angry with her husband   (58) for coming home in an inebriated condition, stabbed him with a knife on Sunday evening.
 
 “Dhan Singh, a regular drunkard, came to the house in an inebriated condition and his wife refused to serve him dinner. He then started abusing his wife, who in a fit of rage stabbed him with a knife used to cut meat,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Ashok  .
 
 Later, Kanwar informed the police that her husband had locked himself in his room. “Circumstantial evidences proved that the woman was behind the murder. We took her for interrogation. Initially, she attempted to mislead us. Finally, she confessed to the crime,” said a senior officer with the Kardhani police station.
 
 Kanwar stated that her husband came home drunk and thrashed her regularly. “She also said that she had to raise the children on her own as her husband spent all the money on liquor. She has been arrested,” said Gupta.
 
 In another incident, a 28-year-old woman died after being thrashed by her husband, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, on Monday afternoon. “She was thrashed with batons. When the neighbours came to help her, they spotted her in an unconscious state and rushed her to the hospital. She succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. The husband, identified as Suresh (32), was rounded up. We have not yet received an official murder complaint. The brother of the deceased woman will file it on Tuesday,” said deputy commissioner of police (east) Kunwar Rastradeep.
