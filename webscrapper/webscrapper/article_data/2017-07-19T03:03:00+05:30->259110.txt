Keri: Heavy rainfall for most part of the day caused land slides in   Ghat and uprooting of trees, disrupting traffic on the busy Panaji-Belagavi highway for almost five hours.

 The torrential rain water on Tuesday was flowing on the road due lack of drainage. Besides seasonal waterfalls, many new waterfalls were seen flowing onto the zigzag and sloppy highway.
 
 The powerful flow of water caused soil erosion and triggered land slides, uprooting of trees as the area is hilly and in the lap of the Western Ghats. More than 200 vehicles were stranded on the highway. 
 
 Passengers from Goa and Karnataka travelling in buses faced hardship, as they were without without food and water in the forest areas. 
 
 On being informed, the station fire officer of Valpoi, Shripad Gawas, swung into action and deployed firemen and an earth moving machine to clear the debris. 
 
 M P Hudelgaddi, executive engineer of water resources department, Karapur, said, “Today, the catchment area of the Anjunem dam has received 129mm of rainfall and dam level reached 84.21m by evening.”
 
 Kalti and Valvonti rivers, along with other seasonal streams, were overflowing. The horticultural crops were damaged in Keri and surrounding areas. 
 
 “The forest department’s tree plantation drive of exotic trees, under the social forestry scheme, is responsible for repeated landslides every year. But this time, scores of waterfalls flowing with great force caused land slips,” a villager, Vithal Shelke, said.
