PANAJI: On Wednesday, chief minister   released his second   message in a month from the US, where he is undergoing treatment for a pancreas-related illness. While the first video, released on May 13, addressed only   workers, Wednesday’s 1.56 minute recording was his first address to the people of Goa. 

 
 The video was released to extend greetings to the people of Goa to mark the 31st Goa Statehood Day, observed on May 30. Parrikar said he hopes for continued cooperation from the people of the state for his government to be able to successfully complete the many ongoing developmental projects in Goa.
 
 “Goa has progressed a lot in the last 31 years and we want to continue the progress at the same pace. In this, your cooperation is extremely important. On this 31st year, we hope that you will provide this cooperation and that the state government will be able to complete its work successfully,” Parrikar said in the video.
 
 He added that the state government is presently striving to create employment opportunities for the youth in the IT and industrial sectors.
 
 “Under Narendra Modi’s leadership, developmental projects are on in full swing in the state. The new Mandovi bridge and   bridge projects are nearing completion and work on the new   is on at a high speed. Goa government has introduced various schemes in the social sector for the people and this has brought much progress in the social sector front,” Parrikar said.
