Team Dhadak, which chose some of the iconic places in the city on its five-day shoot, might be close to the finishing line, but it has already won hearts. A unit member said newcomers  , daughter of   and the late Sridevi, and Ishaan Khatter, brother of  , are director’s actors and followed Shashank Khaitan’s brief to the T. “Janhvi and Ishaan have zero demands. When they rest in between shots, they never ask for the umbrella or fan. They go back to their makeup vans to change, but otherwise are comfortable in this heat,” he said. 

 
  
 
 
 As part of a scene at Maidan on Saturday, an unmindful Janhvi had to stop ahead of a moving tram. “Her expressions were so real that the shot was okayed in no time,” said the unit member. Though Janhvi is a rank newcomer, Ishaan forayed into films with Majid Majidi’s Beyond the Clouds. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Kharaj Mukherjee, who plays a landlord in the film, said they are focused actors. “The director knows what he wants from his actors and team has managed to capture the beauty of Kolkata. Ishaan has almost become my friend and Janhvi is a very sweet and amiable girl. She smiles while talking to everyone. Since they are putting up at a hotel far from south Kolkata, I was telling them the other day how they are missing out on all the action. In fact, the unit is staying near   and there are a lot of markets around that locality. Since Ishaan hasn’t tasted Kolkata’s famous mishti, I gave him a lowdown on where to get them from. Janhvi also listened to it intently. I think Ishaan wants to take some sweets for home,” said Kharaj, who will also be travelling to Mumbai for another chapter of the shoot.
