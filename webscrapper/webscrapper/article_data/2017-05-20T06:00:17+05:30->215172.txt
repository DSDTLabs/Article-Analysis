BENGALURU: Just a year after the first flight of Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40), a basic trainer aircraft, had taken to the sky for the first time, the aircraft's second prototype completed its maiden flight here on Friday.

 “It flew for an hour in the evening and completed the flight without any glitches,“ a source said.
 
 The aircraft, which was flown by a   ( ) test pilot, had completed the highspeed taxi trials a few days ago.
 
 Confirming the developments, HAL chairman   said: “The first flight of protype two took place at HAL on Friday . The second prototype was readied within a year and flew for one hour, carrying out important manoeuvres.“
 
 Unlike projects like Light Combat Aircraft ( )   and others, which are dependent on advances from the government in the development stages, HAL has earmarked Rs 350 crore from its own funds for the HTT-40 project.
