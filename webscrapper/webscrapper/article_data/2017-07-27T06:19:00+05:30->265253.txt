Nagpur: Around 1,000   and balwadi employees and farmers protested against the non-implementation of fixed monthly pension for former employees and 50% minimum support price (MSP) and loan waiver for farmers. The protest took place in Ganeshpeth on Wednesday.

 The Maharashtra Rajya Anganwadi Balwadi Karmachaari Union, Maharashtra Kisan Sabha and city unit of the Communist Party of India (CPI) organized the agitation. The demonstration later turned into a ‘jail bharo andolan’ when the police stepped in and began rounding up protesters for blocking the traffic.
 
 General secretary of the union, Shyam Kale claimed that, during the general election campaigns in 2014, PM Modi assured fixed monthly pensions of Rs 3,000 to retired anganwadi and balwadi workers, which has not been implemented yet. “Government has not kept its promises,” he said. 
 
 The protest was also an attempt to pressure the state government into waiving agriculture loans as well as demand for the implementation of the recommendations of MS Swaminathan Commission. Kale said, “Despite several protests, the state government has not waived the debt of farmers nor has the centre implemented 50% MSP recommended in the commission’s report.”
 
 Joint secretary of CPI’s city unit Ajay Sahu said, “The central government should set-up a farmers’ relief fund of Rs1 lakh crore and pay Rs3,000 per month as pension to farmers above 60 years of age. The anganwadi and balwadi employees should also be given the same treatment as a standard government employee.”
 
 Sahu added, “Farming equipment like tractors and water pumps should be excluded from the ambit of Goods and Service Tax (GST).” Sahu informed the groups’ protest is a three day nationwide protest starting Wednesday.
