MANGALURU: In a significant message to the rich who don’t mind spending crores on the lavish weddings of their sons and daughters, an   from Sullia will get six   married the day his sixth daughter enters into a wedlock.

 For Ibrahim, a resident of Gundyadka Halegetu in Sullia, 88 km from here, helping poor girls get married has always been a dream. “I have married my five daughters with hardship. My dream to help economically backward girls get married will finally come true on the day my sixth daughter weds,” says 56-year-old Ibrahim, father of seven daughters and three sons.
 
 Ibrahim travelled across Sullia, Belthangadi and Puttur taluks in search of deserving brides and found six of them — two are orphans and four are from poor families. “I travelled in search of girls facing financial hardships in getting married,” he says.
 
 His daughter’s wedding will be held on February 5 at his house where the six girls will also enter into a wedlock. Ibrahim will give them gold, clothes and treat their families with delicacies. 
 
 “I’m doing all this because I believe I didn’t give anything to the world when I was born nor can I take anything when I die,” he says.
 
 In his early days, Ibrahim went to Gulf in search of job. After working there for two years, he returned to Sullia and started selling fish in a tempo. 
 
 He supplies fish in and around Puttur and Sullia taluks, and also in parts of Madikeri. “I know what it is to be a poor. My mother worked in paddy fields to raise me. We were so poor that we could not even go to school,” he says.
 
 “Apart from sponsoring poor girls, Ibrahim is involved in charitable activities. He has donated his earnings to trusts and other organizations,” says Riyaz Kattekar of Malenadu Charitable Trust.
