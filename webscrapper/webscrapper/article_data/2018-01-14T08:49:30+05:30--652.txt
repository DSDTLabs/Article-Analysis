CHENNAI: On the eve of Pongal,   president M  's   residence and surrounding areas were decked up with plantain trees and sugarcanes on Saturday. The   as Tamil New Year as well. 

 The party cadres and leaders are hopeful that Karunanidhi would meet them on Pongal day as had been the tradition for long.
 
 He would also give 10 each to all those who call on him on Pongal day. But last year Karunanidhi disappointed the cadres as he was ill. 
 
 "Arrangements have been made for cadres to meet Thalaivar from a distance. Whether he will meet them or not will depend on doctors' advice," said a senior DMK leader. The party leadership has asked visitors to Karunanidhi's residence to avoid carrying bouquets.
 
 Karunanidhi, of late, has been meeting many political leaders. "He is able to recognize people and at times, he lifts his hand to wave at the visitors," said a senior party leader.
