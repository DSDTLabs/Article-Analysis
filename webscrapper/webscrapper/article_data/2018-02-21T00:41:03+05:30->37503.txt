Coimbatore: After the state horticulture farm at Kannampalayam near Sulur was closed down in 2011, local farmers were forced to travel far and shell out a fortune to buy quality saplings. Now,  .

 “A month ago, a group of experts visited the facility and said it was well suited to resume operations. We expect that the operations would resume soon,” a horticulture department official told TOI.
 
 The facility, situated on the campus of the directorate of seed certification and belonging to the state horticulture department, used to supply saplings of mango, gooseberry, sapodilla, casuarina and coconut to the farmers at nominal rates.
 
 The facility was a boon to the local farmers, 45-year-old farmer K Velusamy of Kaniyur, who used to buy casuarina saplings from the farm, told TOI. “Agricultural officers used to recommend saplings from the farm. But, for the past seven years, we have been travelling far to get saplings or buying them at high rates from private outlets,” he said.
 
 Department officials said the operation of the farm was suspended due to water scarcity. “Ground water level in the area had gone down drastically. This caused the bore well water to turn brackish and made it unsuitable for cultivation of fruit saplings. Laying pipelines to bring water to the farm was not feasible,” he said.
