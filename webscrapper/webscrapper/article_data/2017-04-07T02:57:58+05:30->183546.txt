GURUGRAM: The district labour department has initiated a probe into the death of  , which his colleagues have attributed to the negligence of the company. 

  Sources told   prima facie it appeared that  , the auto parts manufacturing unit where the 37-year-old contractual worker was killed on duty, neglected the health and safety norms as prescribed under the Factories Act, 1948. 
 
 Prashad died after being caught up in a conveyor belt. The pulls caused jerks in his arm and the chest area, probably leading to a cardiac arrest, doctors suspect. However, sources said the tragedy could have been averted had the company installed a safety fence around the conveyor belt.
 
 Moreover, there is no clarity as to what led to the accident. This is because there were no CCTV cameras on the ground floor. Prashad was working alone in one corner of the floor and nobody noticed exactly how he was killed.
 
 Though sources said the management told police and labour officials that Prashad probably dozed off on the job, which led to the accident, his supervisor was not aware of his movements. "This shows there was no proper supervision at the time of the accident. Nor were there any fire hydrant," sources said.
 
 When contacted,  , assistant director (industrial safety), said, "We are conducting an investigation and will submit a report by this weekend. Only then we will be able to share details of the violations."
 
 However,  , HR manager of the company, brushed aside the allegations. "We are extremely careful about the workers' safety. Our biggest client is Maruti Suzuki which is very strict about such issues. A few days ago, too, their officials had visited our factory for safety audit. There is no compromise on it," he said.
