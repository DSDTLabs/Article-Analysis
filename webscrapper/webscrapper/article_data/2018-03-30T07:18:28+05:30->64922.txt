PUNE:  , the district guardian minister, on Thursday asked the civic administration to curtail daily   to 1,350 MLD to ensure adequate supply for the city till the arrival of monsoon. Officials, however, assured that there would be no immediate water cuts because of the curtailment.

 “Adequate water was supplied to the city over the last seven-eight months. The city will have to restrict its daily lifting of water to 1,350 MLD in view of the current storage levels in the dams. Also, the civic administration will have to take measures to avoid wastage. Controlled use of water will ensure adequate supply to the city and rural areas, Bapat said at the canal committee meeting on Thursday.
 
 The state irrigation department has claimed that in the past few months, the   (PMC) had lifted up to 1,650 MLD of water, which is in excess of its stipulated quota of 900 MLD. On Thursday, irrigation officials tabled the details of PMC’s water usage in the last three months. On an average, the city has been lifting around 1,600 MLD since January, the officials said. Bapat told mayor   and   authorities to stick to lifting just 1350 MLD of water till July, and chalk out a plan showing how this daily quota can be supplied in an effective way. “There is no point in making this a tussle between urban and rural areas. Every sector will get adequate water from the available quota. City’s water supply can be increased in case of a good monsoon. But as of now, the city will have to manage with 1350 MLD,” he said.
 
 Bapat pointed out that this year farmers were able to save 2.5 TMC of water in dams during the winter rotations because of better water management. Moreover, steps were being taken by the municipal corporations of Pune and   to restrict transportation losses, which are up to 40% in certain areas. Effective planning can save more water, he said.
