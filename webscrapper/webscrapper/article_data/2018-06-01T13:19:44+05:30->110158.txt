SURAT: The Salabatpura   arrested two thieves and recovered stolen textile products and a truck total worth Rs 86 lakh from Begampura area on Wednesday. 

 
 Police arrested a salesman Vishnu Gupta dealing in textile products and mastermind of the   Shivlal Jain. Police had earlier registered an offence after owner of Shah Patel Roadways Rajesh Patel lodged a complaint about theft of his truck from Juni Koyli Khadi on May 19 
 
 “Jain used to offer a sari to goddess after every successful theft. He did so after this theft too and one sari from the stock was found missing,” the police said.
 
 The truck was loaded with 181 bundles of textile product to be delivered in Ahmedabad and had left from Surat on May 18. When the consignment did not reach Ahmedabad, Patel lodged the complaint. 
 
 During investigation, the police found that driver Mohammad Idrish had sold the textile products to Gupta, who has a business in Punagam. Police nabbed Gupta with the textile products from Begampura and questioning led to Jain.
 
 Investigation revealed that Jain used to sell the stolen products and he is a member of a Mumbai-based gang that deals in stolen trucks loaded with different types of goods. After Idrish stole the truck, Jain found Gupta and sold him the textile products. However, before Gupta could sell them, the police arrested him. Police are yet to arrest Idrish and others involved in the theft.
