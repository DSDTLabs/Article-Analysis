PUNE: It has been two weeks since a fight broke out between two students' unions at the   ( ), but the security on the campus is yet to be beefed up despite assurance from the vice-chancellor. 

 After the clash on February 24, vice-chancellor Wasudev N Gade had promised to depute 60 security personnel on the campus in a week's time. However, nothing has been done, so far, students told TOI on Tuesday. 
 
 Richa Surve, student of the   department, said , "Besides the clash, a car was also vandalised on the campus. These incidents have definitely lowered our confidence to roam around on the campus even during the day time. We have raised these issues with the administration, but nothing concrete has happened till now."
 
 Ranjeet Damle, a psychology student, said, "A lot of student groups are seen going around the campus and it is unsafe as we do not quite know the identity of these students."
 
 One of the student representatives from SPPU, Sudama Deokate, said, "We often receive complaints from students about the lack of security. The strength of security personnel is low and the request to add more has just met with assurances but no action."
 
 Brigadier   (retd), director of security, SPPU, said, "The process of recruiting more security officers has started. It will take a minimum of eight days for the staff to be deployed. The security will definitely be tightened by March 20."
