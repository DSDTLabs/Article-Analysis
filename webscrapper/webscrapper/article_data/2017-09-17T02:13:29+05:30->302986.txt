GREATER NOIDA:   of 39 villages, whose land had been acquired for the   ( ), tried to stall the work of the   at two Greater Noida   on Saturday, seeking a higher compensation for their land. 

 Nearly 200 farmers, including women, arrived at the construction site in Samauddinpur village in the morning and forced the labourers to stop the work. Officials including Dadri SDM Amit Singh tried to convince the farmers against stalling the work. The farmers, however, asserted that gram panchayats are still operating in their villages and hence they should be paid compensation as per the market rate of the agricultural land. The farmers remained adamant and the officers left the spot around 5pm.
 
 In Jaganpur village, though the farmers tried to stall work for the second day, they were removed from the spot. Some farmers from Faridabad and Palwal too joined the protest. Nine persons have also been booked for stalling the work the previous day.
 
 Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to cancel the arms licence of farmer leader Sunil Fauji, who is at the forefront of the agitation. 
 
 The land for EPE was acquired in 2006 and again in 2017.
 
 According to the farmers, they are being paid Rs 3,500 per square metre as for the acquisition done in 2006. “The compensation amount for the 2006 acquisition was settled in 2016. However, now our land is worth 10,000 per sqm. How can we accept Rs 3,500 as compensation,” Naresh Singh, one of the farmers, told TOI. After the farmers objected to Rs 3,500 as compensation, DM BN Singh raised the amount to Rs 3,640. However, the farmers said that the same was too low.
 
 After the government acquired more land in March 2017 from 24 persons of the same villages for widening of EPE, the farmers demanded that they be given four times compensation under the 2013 Act.
