 In 2014, the UPA Government had approved North Sewage Disposal Scheme under JNNURM that now replaced with AMRUT by the NDA Government. However, the NDA government did not continue with the approval.
 
 Sewage collection, disposal and treatment works are necessary for the city as entire sewage generated from the city goes into Nag, Pili and Pora rivers polluting the water bodies and also groundwater table. There is no mechanism to collect sewage and take out of city followed by treatment and safe disposal.
