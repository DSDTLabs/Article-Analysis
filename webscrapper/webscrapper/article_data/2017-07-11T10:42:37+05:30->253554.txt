LUCKNOW: An   call by   in Patna on August 29 will trigger a   against the Narendra Modi government and stalwart leader Sharad Pawar will be the guiding force, said National Congress Party state president  .

 Speaking to TOI, Dixit said Pawar has already clarified that he was neither in the race for prime minister nor the face of Opposition, but he would knit together non-BJP parties to launch anti-Modi stir across the nation. Dixit said most of the   leaders including from the SP, BSP and the   would also attend the rally.
 
 Dixit said Presidential polls have already begun, uniting the Opposition as meetings were attended by the Samajwadi Party and the BSP and this is just beginning and post August 15 , Independence Day, Opposition unity would further shape up.
 
 The NCP chief said time has come for Opposition to unite and fight against the Modi government the way it once fought against Indira Gandhi and dislodged her in 1975. He said the nation was facing threat to fundamental principles of tolerance and communal unity. He added that chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi should rise above sectarian and communal politics and devote time and energy to the development of the state rather than raising the temple issue and whipping up communal sentiments.
 
 “People of UP have voted BJP to power to govern and rule,” said Dixit describing first three months of the Yogi government as disappointing and adding that the state was heading towards a crisis.
 
 Dixit also criticised the BJP government in the state for indulging in vendetta against the SP and BSP by ordering a series of inquiries into their development projects. “Why has Yogi not laid a single foundation for any new project in the 100 days,” he asked.
