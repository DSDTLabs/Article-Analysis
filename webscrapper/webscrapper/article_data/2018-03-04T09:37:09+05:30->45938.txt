 PM Narendra Modi's pre-eminence emphasised yet again. The results especially

 Saturday put a spanner in   party's efforts to project that it is on the recovery trail. The results underline its popularity deficit in vast stretches and the advantage BJP enjoys because of its hunger for victory, as well as a well-oiled party machine.

The Vajpayee government’s failure to secure their release upset the Sangh and caused it to campaign only halfheartedly in the 2004 polls. The formation of a saffron government in Tripura should lead an ecstatic Nagpur to put aside the grievances of its affiliates and throw its weight fully behind Modi’s 2019 Lok Sabha campaign
 
 
 
  The continued presence of a BJP-linked government in   should help implement the ‘framework’ agreement to resolve the country’s oldest insurgency, which was signed in 2015. The election results will encourage national security adviser A K Doval to accelerate efforts for an early closure on negotiations
 
 
 
  BJP may have to moderate its stand on wedge issues like cattle slaughter, or risk being at a disadvantage in Christian-majority states.
