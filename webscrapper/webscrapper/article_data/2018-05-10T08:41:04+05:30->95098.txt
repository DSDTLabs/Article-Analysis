We have seen kids of Bollywood celebs accompanying them on the sets of their shoot. From Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's daughter, Sanjay Dutt's kids to Riteish Deshmukh's son, there are many examples of the same.  

     


 Now, adding to this list was Shilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra's son Viaan. However, he not just joined her but also donned the director's hat for a while. Shilpa shared a BTS video of her ad shoot where we can see Viaan watching the screen and says "Roll camera, Action!" The caption of the video read, "Starting young 🤦🏻‍♀️my son Viaan-Raj on my shoot and takes over.. #callingtheshots! What’s new!? #nolongerlittle #growinguptoofast #son #instagood #love #happiness #onset #shootdiaries #swasthrahomastraho". Check out the video here: 
  
  
   






 It seems, Viaan has already decided his career and has also started taking steps to achieve success in the same.
