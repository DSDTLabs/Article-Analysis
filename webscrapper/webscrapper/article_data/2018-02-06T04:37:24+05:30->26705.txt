 We have to carry forward the development model envisioned by   as CM. Welfare of farmers and villagers and employment are areas we are working on. There are several initiatives, which need to be retained but our focus will be on development of coastal areas and encouraging women to opt for jobs as it will lead to gender parity.
 
 
 
 We have repeatedly challenged the opposition to come and have an open debate over Gujarat model. They should come with facts and figures about development in states they have ruled. Despite adversities, Gujarat has been a role model in terms of development.
 
 
 
 There is no denying that taking over from a competent and performing leader like Narendrabhai is a challenge. However, he remains our guiding force as PM. We had a hostile government at the Centre when Narendrabhai was CM. But today, we are working in cohesion with the Centre and results are there to see. Eighteen projects were stuck due to UPAâ€™s hostility but they were cleared in the last 3-4 years.
 
 
 
 See, assembly elections are different from general elections. Narendra   remains the most popular leader of the country and people will vote for him. Even in assembly polls, we won a full majority with higher vote share compared with previous state polls. In 2014, we had won all 26 LS seats and the feat will be repeated in 2019.
 
 
 
 Patidar agitation was a   sponsored campaign. People of the community have realised that   is a Congress agent.
 
 
 
 In a democratic party like ours, differences are bound to happen. However, we have done course correction and are now working as a team.
