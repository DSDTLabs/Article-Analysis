Madurai: The American College here has organised a lunar eclipse watch in the college premises on January 31, in view of the rare cosmic event on that day. Super Blue Blood Moon – a rarest of rare celestial phenomenon is set to occur after 150 years.  This cosmic event may be glimpsed in parts of western North America, Asia, the Middle East, Russia and Australia. The event is causing a buzz because it combines three unusual lunar events -an extra big super moon, a blue moon and a total lunar eclipse, according to college sources. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse can be viewed with the naked eye. There is a good chance that one can get a good view of the super blue blood moon from a tall building between 6.21 pm and 7.37 pm on January 31. Lunar eclipses are best seen through the naked eye. The rising moon, at 6.21 pm, will be slightly more reddish in colour than usual. The next total lunar eclipse visible from India will be on July 27, 2018, but it will not be a blue or a super moon. With the view of facilitating interested people to have a glimpse of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, American College is making arrangements to witness this event through some of the telescopes from college, Principal, M Davamani Christober said. “The lunar watch will be arranged on top of James Hall inside the college premises and interested public should be present in college premises by 6 pm on Wednesday,” he mentioned. In addition to the lunar watch, the college is also planning to give free one-day hands-on training in making 2 inch refractor telescopes during the third week of March 2018. This will be useful for students and amateur astronomers. Those who are interested should be ready to pay for raw materials that have to be procured from external suppliers. Further details could be obtained from the college office at phone number 0452- 2530070 or from Dr S S R Inbanathan, head of the department of applied science from the college.
