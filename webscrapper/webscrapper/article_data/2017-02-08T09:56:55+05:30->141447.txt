 Surjit Sardana, an applicant at   said, "Last week I went to apply for my brother's licence for a moped as he is still in school. We did not have the permission letter from school or parents either so we were sent out of the RTO premises. But there, the aides of the agents keep hovering around the application windows and one of them promised to get us the licence for a charge of Rs 2000."
