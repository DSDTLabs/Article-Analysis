 “The principal said that the kid was inattentive in maths class and was busy playing with his pencil and paper. I never questioned the school even if he got fewer marks and said that he would pick up when he comes to class five or so.

May be that's why they are playing up the incident,“ said George Chowdhary, correspondent of the school.
 
  Ramu and his wife approached Balala Hakula Sangham and filed a complaint under IPC section 323 and  .
