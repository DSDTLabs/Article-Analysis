 The actress, who had tied the knot with Mumbai-based Chartered Accountant, Mayur Padia in November 2015, was a busy bee with the shooting schedule throughout her pregnancy period.
 
 Disha was earlier quite undecided as to when she wanted to resume work as she wanted to spend some time with the little bundle of joy. 
 
 It seems her return is only going to bring joy to her fans, who can't wait for her to entertain them again on the small screen.
