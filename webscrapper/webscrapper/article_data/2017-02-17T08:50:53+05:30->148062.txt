NEW DELHI:  , who made a dream debut last season, are eager to roar again. And, to add meat to their coaching staff, the Lions have roped in former Indian cricketer   as the new assistant coach.

 He will work with team's head coach  . Kaif was excited about his new assignment and told TOI he would use his vast experience to help the team. “I have played with top players like Shane Warne, Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, Mahela Jayawardene and Virat Kohli and I am sure I will be able to help my team with my experience,” Kaif, who at 36 is one of the fittest players and an athletic fielder, said.
 
 Kaif also said that having a young owner like Keshav Bansal was a big advantage for Gujarat. “The presence of Keshav would make a lot of difference to the dressing room atmosphere,” he said.
 
 According to Bansal, Kaif 's induction will boost the side to perform better than last year. “Kaif has played a key role in many Indian victories. He has captained a couple of domestic teams for long and also played in the   for different sides over the years. Our team will certainly benefit from his presence in the dressing room,” Bansal said.
 
 “This year we are hoping to better our performance and Kaif's role would be important,” Bansal said. “We had a goal when we came in as a team for two years. We would love to continue our association with BCCI. We will take a call when the time is right.”
