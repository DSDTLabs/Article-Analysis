CHENNAI: The protests against   in   did not cease even after the exams concluded as more then 50 members of the   (SFI) attempted to lay siege to the CBSE’s regional office in   on Monday demanding that the exams be nullified. However, city police put out barricades and prevented the protesters from marching towards the office.

 Some protesters including two women suffered minor injuries after being manhandled by police and were treated at a hospital, said D  , SFI Chennai district president. “We told them (police) that we would not create any ruckus and we just wanted to register our protest against NEET. But they didn’t grant us permission and took us away,” he said. 
 
 
 
 The protestors said that the central government has not acted in the best interests of the students of Tamil Nadu, which already has a solid healthcare system. “The state government too did not raise any voice over the atrocities against its students for the second continuous year, which is baffling,” Chandru said.
 
 Police bundled the protesters into a van and detained them at a wedding hall in Padi Pudhur. They were released later in the evening. CBSE officials said they were only doing their mandated jobs. “The regional officer is currently out of town and hence no talks could be held with the protesters. While their demands can be heard, it is important to understand that any decision regarding NEET cannot be taken by the regional office. We are only carrying out our responsibility entrusted to us by the  ,” an official at the regional office said.
 
 NEET has been receiving stick from political parties in Tamil Nadu and the student community since 2017 and this year was no different. The protests gathered momentum last year after Ariyalur student Anitha killed herself, protesting against NEET.
