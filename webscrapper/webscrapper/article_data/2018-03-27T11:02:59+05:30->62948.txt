SECUNDERABAD: With the onset of summer, sale of spurious drinking water bottles is back at railway stations across the city.

 Many people buy these ‘purified water’ bottles to beat the heat, totally unaware that they are drinking contaminated water, warned health experts.
 
 This illegal trade is rampant during summer and police sources say the used plastic bottles, which are thrown by passengers in litter bins at stations or railway tracks, are picked up by teenagers, dodging the eyes of security guards posted at the entrance of the stations. They carry the bottles to nearby places where these are replenished with local tap water and sold for Rs 15-20 each.
 
 “Selling spurious water has been a booming business in the city and it mostly happens near railway stations, from where the maximum number of used bottles can be collected. Machines are also available to seal the bottles after refilling them. The errant traders prefer taking the bottles with original brand levels intact, so that people will not spare a thought on the purity of the water they drink,” a railway police officer told TOI.
 
 Cops said street vendors sell the unhealthy water in the city and sometimes at various tea or pan/cigarette stalls, close to the stations. “The vendors shy away from selling it in the stations like Secunderabad, Hyderabad or Kachiguda. People hardly crush the bottles after using and this makes way for the illegal business to thrive,” asserted a railway official.
 
 However, there has not been any stringent action from either the government railway police or the railway police force to clamp down on the illicit water business. “We shall launch an operation to bust the racket by raiding possible places in the city where they procure such fake water bottles,” said the officer, when quizzed why there has been no action.
