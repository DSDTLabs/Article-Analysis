HYDERABAD: To the discerning, the move was imminent. A year ago, there were quite a few nervous glances exchanged when   walked into the middle after the early dismissal of David Warner in the second over of their innings against Delhi Daredevils. But what transpired over the next 14 overs was sheer magic. The New Zealander realised 136 for the second wicket with   and his blinder (89; 51b, 4x6, 6x5) set up a comfortable win for the Sunrisers.

 
 
 
 
 With Warner now out of the mix given the circumstances he's roiled in, Williamson, the only foreign captain in the 11th edition of  , will need to play the role more often, be it in stabilising the innings or sustaining the thrust provided at the top by Dhawan and Alex Hales.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 In addressing the inadequacy of a middle order not matching up to expectations last year, the Sunrisers have assembled an explosive set of players capable of giving them the momentum when they begin their campaign against   at the Rajiv Gandhi international Stadium on Monday. "We've always done well at Uppal, but it's always important to start off on a winning note," said SRH mentor VVS Laxman. 
 
  
  
 
 
 The three new recruits who plied their trade for Kolkata Knight Riders before - Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan and Shakib Al Hasan - along with Wriddhiman Saha, Deepak Hooda and Carlos Brathwaite are all seasoned in the art of biffing the ball and how well they will be of service remains to be seen of a team that's relied a fair bit on Bhuvneshwar Kumar, their bowling supremo, and Afghan leggie  , for deliverance.
 
 The Royals find themselves in a similar boat, having lost Steve Smith before a ball was bowled in anger, but in   they have a man for all seasons.
