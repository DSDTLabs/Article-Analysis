MUMBAI: A special   court recently rejected an application by a 2008 Malegoan bomb blast accused seeking transfer of the case to another court. Retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay had filed an application to recuse the NIA court, saying he had no faith in this court and sought suo moto transfer of the case. 

 After receiving the application, the court called for the prosecution's reply. The prosecution resisted the application and prayed for its dismissal. The special public prosecutor submitted before the court that the application was not maintainable. S D Tekale, special judge, said the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the NIA Act also does not empower this court to transfer the case suo moto to any other court. 
 
 "In view of the position and as pointed out above, this court has no jurisdiction to transfer the case suo moto. The prayer made by the applicant cannot be granted," said Tekale.
