IMPHAL: The N Biren Singh government has appointed two officers to man the anti-corruption cell set up within the chief minister's office in Imphal. 

 Civil servant P   and Manipur Police officer   have been appointed as anti-corruption officers. They would be responsible for looking into complaints and maintaining a register containing the details of the complaint along with the name and contact details of the complainant, a statement issued by the state information and public relations department said.
 
 The cell will forward the complaint to the chief minister's secretary, who, in turn, will bring it to the chief minister's notice. The cell's dedicated phone number is 9402150000.
 
 Stating that the identity of the complainant would be kept confidential, the statement said each complaint would be screened. The meeting of the screening committee will be held on the 1st and 16th of every month and if the days happen to fall on a holiday, it will be held on the next working day.
 
 This is one of the major steps taken up by the BJP-led coalition government to bring about 'good governance' in Manipur. Before this, it had successfully brought to an end the over four-month long economic blockade of the state's national highways.
 
 Meanwhile, the Churachandpur-based  , which has been agitating against three 'anti-tribal' bills passed by the state government, is likely to hold talks with the government next week.
 
 "We hope the protracted agitation will be resolved once the two sides come to an understanding," agriculture minister  , who represents  , said.
