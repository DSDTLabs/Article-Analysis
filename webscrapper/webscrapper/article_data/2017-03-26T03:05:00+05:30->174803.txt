Nagpur: SSC students appeared for social science-II (geography) exam on Saturday, which evoked mixed reaction from them. Similar was the reaction from VP Dakhole, principal of Somalwar High School, Ramdaspeth, who said the paper was not as easy as history. “There were some questions which were tricky and confusing. In fact, 3-4 questions were from the internal section of the textbook. But again, it depends on the preparation of every student. For board exams, you should be ready to face questions from anywhere,” she said. However, she said that long questions were easy as compared to the short ones. “For observation, a pie chart was given for the first time. Also, there was a question to find out the location of a river in the map, which is not usually asked,” she added. Student Pallavi Tekale said, “I encountered some problem in the short questions; they were not straightforward. It was a medium kind of a paper for me. The graph was difficult, but at the same time, long questions were from the book and easy.” Similarly, Rahul Borkar said that some questions were very confusing and also not from the exercise. “I thought that this will be an easy paper like history. There was no problem regarding time and length of the paper, it was properly allotted,” he said. However, Shalen and Shirley Mohod had different reactions as compared to others. Shalen said right from short questions to the long ones as well as the timing, everything was balanced. “I prepared from the textbook and also from the internal sections. Hence, I was able to solve even the tricky questions. However, the map was a bit of a challenge. But at the end, I managed to solve it. Both of us are expecting good marks,” she added.
