Hair stylist   has now reacted to the hullabaloo around her lip lock with ex   contestant  , that surfaced on social media on March 27. In a Facebook post, the reality television star has clarified that it wasn't really a kiss but a snapshot of Boomerang that went viral. 

  
  
 In the same, Sapna also mentioned how love should not have a gender. Here's what she wrote, reposting the same video:
  
 "Just finished yoga and saw that Bani J and I are trending for a kiss which I wish was a kiss but really just a snapshot of a boomerang. India when will we move forward. Really! Sooooooooo Much attention for a KISS??? Dang people fighting for world peace don't trend so much!!! lol. Hope more women and men come out and kiss and show ya'll love does not have a gender. My life. My rules. Kisses to all. Men and Women and the Transgender."
  
 
 
  
 All the hype around their lip lock started with a Bommerang video clicked at a music fest over the weekend, where the two women were apparently seen kissing each other.
  
 Both Bani J and Sapna Bhavnani are feminists in their own right. And known for defying conventions. 
  
 While Sapna has been vocal about being bisexual, Bani is rumored to be dating television actor  , who shot to fame with a show on MTV India.
