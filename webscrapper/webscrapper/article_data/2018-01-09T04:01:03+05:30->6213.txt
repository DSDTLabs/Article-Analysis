NEW DELHI: The   is now instituting a screening mechanism to identify the pre-malignant stage of   in women in the next eight months. Even as India accounts for 1/4th of the cervical cancer burden with every 1 in 53 woman being at risk of the disease, the municipal health facilities — hospitals, maternity centres and MCW centres — which attend to a large number of patients with gynaecological problems from economically disadvantaged background, have no feasible mechanism to screen this form of cancer.

 The civic body operates five big hospitals, eight maternity centres and 79 mother and child welfare centres and records a footfall of over 50 lakh patients. The proposal has been made by north corporation mayor Preety Agarwal who said that the concept of safety for women can’t be complete without ensuring their health first. “Since most of the patients are from poor background, it is our duty to make these tests available,” she said.
