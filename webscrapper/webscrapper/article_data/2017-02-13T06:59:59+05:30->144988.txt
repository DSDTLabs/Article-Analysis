KOLKATA: The heart feels things the eyes cannot see, and knows what the mind cannot understand — barely a fortnight back   wrote these words on his Facebook wall. On Sunday morning, his heart stopped functioning on way to a south Kolkata nursing home after a fatal accident, but his eyes continued to see the world he left behind. Parents of the 30-year-old entrepreneur donated his eyes, setting an example for the society that supports   donation.

 Karan was returning home on Sunday morning with his friends after a night out when their car collided with a goods carrier in front of the Eliot Park. Karan and a co-passenger, Simarprit, were injured. While they were being rushed to a south Kolkata nursing home, Karan succumbed to his injuries. But his story did not end at that as his father Ajjay, the MD of  , decided to donate his eyes. “He was blessed with beautiful eyes. We always found him to be a gem of a person,” recounted Priyanka Ganatra, a friend of Karan. 
 
 On receiving a call from Ajjay, a team from Priyamvada Birla Arvind Eye Hospital reached the nursing home. The corneas were extracted after an hour-long procedure. Later, a team from Calcutta Medical College and Hospital took the corneas from them. None of Karan’s family members could be contacted.
