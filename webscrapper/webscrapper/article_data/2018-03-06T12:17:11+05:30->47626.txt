TRICHY:   seized nine motor pumps from residents after they were found to be using them to unlawfully draw in water from the pipelines laid out in the residential areas of   on Monday.

 The authorities also sent out a warning against the malpractice as that could seriously affect the drinking waters supply, adding they would discontinue supplying water to those who would be caught doing the same in future.
 
 While the residents were complaining of poor drinking water supply, a surprise visit from the officials found that many of the residents were using motor pumps to draw in water from the pipelines. 
 
 Such extraction of water is banned by the municipality as it will cause potential damage to the drinking water pipeline.
 
 Even as the residents alleged that the civic body has failed to ensure regular supply of drinking water over the past few weeks, the municipality asked them to use pipeline water only for drinking purpose.
 
 However, “Most of the residents have constructed huge tanks and use the water meant for drinking for all other purpose,” says J Subramanian, commissioner in charge of Pudukkottai Municipality.
 
 He said that 27 motor pumps were confiscated only a few days ago from Kamaraj puram area for similar misuse, he said steps would be taken to sensitize people on the ill-effects of the practice.
 
 Water is supplied on daily basis to 27 of the 42 wards, the remaining, however, get supply on alternate days. The increasing demand from 1.6 lakh residents is met through supply of 12 MLD water from combined drinking water scheme from   and 1 MLD from local sources, he said.
 
 Though he said that water supply has been maintained and there was no shortage at the moment, he added that 550 bore wells in the municipality were kept as standbys to meet the increasing demand.
