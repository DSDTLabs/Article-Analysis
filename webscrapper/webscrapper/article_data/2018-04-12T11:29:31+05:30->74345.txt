PANAJI: The plea of a rape accused who sought release on   on grounds that a DNA report had confirmed he was not the biological father of the child born to the survivor, was dismissed by a local court.

 The accused,  , who has been in judicial custody for over a year, had approached the additional sessions court at Panaji for bail. He is facing trial for committing rape in 2016.
 
 The lawyer of the accused pointed out that in a case decided by the high court of Bombay, the rape accused was released on bail after the DNA report stated that he was not the biological father of the child born to the survivor.
 
 The prosecution argued that though the paternity test of the accused was negative, the allegations of rape against him were serious in nature. The survivor is yet to be examined before the court and there is a possibility she may be threatened, public prosecutor  , said.
 
 Additional sessions judge   noted that as per the DNA report, it was observed prima facie that the accused was not the biological father of the child born to the survivor who complained that she was raped by the accused.
 
 Differentiating the case before the high court of Bombay and this case, Ambre said that in the high court case, the accused was in love with the survivor and had promised to marry her before entering into a physical relationship.
 
 “The fact of the present case is that the accused had committed rape on the prosecutrix by wrongfully restraining her and taking her to a jungle and even threatening her,” the judge noted.
 
 Regarding the prosecution’s argument, the judge also said that the evidence of the survivor could not be recorded as she had undergone an operation at the   and Hospital (GMC), Bambolim.
