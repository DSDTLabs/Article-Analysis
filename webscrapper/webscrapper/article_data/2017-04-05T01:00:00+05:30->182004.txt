BAGAHA: The   was elevated to   in 1974, but nothing has changed in the last 43 years. 

 Sources in the hospital said the situation is grim due to various reasons, including inadequate grants from the state government, short supply of medicines and staff shortage. There are only two doctors against the sanctioned posts for 31. All the important posts of doctors, including dental, ophthalmologist, gynaecologist, cardiologist, pathologist, orthopaedic, child specialist and   are lying vacant for years. The two doctors posted here are deputy superintendent Dr A K Tiwari and Dr SP Aggarwal. Both are physicians and attend outdoor patients only on alternate days.
 
 An employee said the hospital was supposed to have 100 beds, but it has only 40. The ICU is not functioning properly due to lack of doctors and trained paramedical staff. 
 
 “Patients in serious conditions are usually referred to Bettiah or Patna. People come to this hospital only to seek injury reports,” said a source. 
 
 Sources said apart from doctors, there is also acute shortage of nurses. There are only 12 Grade A nurses against the sanctioned posts for 51. At times these nurses, who have connections with private clinics and nursing homes, suggest pregnant patients not to get admitted in the hospital for delivery. “Instead, they refer them to private hospitals and get commission,” said a source, adding that on paper the delivery is done at the hospital so that the patient gets the benefit of government schemes. 
 
 Dr Tiwari admitted that there were some problems in the gynaecology department due to lack of lady doctor. “A gynaecologist was posted here recently, but she did not return after joining,” he said. 
 
 He also admitted that there was acute shortage of medicines in the hospital.
