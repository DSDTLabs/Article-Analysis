CHENNAI: A day after the   government set four months deadline to acquire late Tamil Nadu chief minister J  's residence,  , social activist Traffic KR Ramaswamy has moved the Madras high court seeking to stop the acquisition.

 The octogenarian activist, who filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on Thursday, wanted the court to restrain the state government from acquiring and converting the   residence in Chennai as a memorial using public funds.
 
 The plea, which is likely to be heard on Friday, claimed that the government should not be allowed to build a memorial for Jayalalithaa “who was declared a convict in the disproportionate assets case by the Supreme Court.”
 
 The recent move by the government to survey the property and complete the acquisition under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act has prompted the activist to approach the court.
 
 On August 17, 2017 chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced that his government would convert Veda Nilayam into a memorial. Following the announcement, Jayalalithaa's niece J Deepa moved the high court which disposed of the plea in October 23, 2017 with a direction to the state government to take a decision on her representation within four months.
