CHANDIGARH: Less deployment of women police personnel during night hours is a major cause of insecurity among women wanting to report cases related to sexual harassment, according to a study by the department of laws,  , on   in educational institutions.

 
  
 
 The data collected pointed out that a majority of women feel comfortable to discuss sexual harassment with women police personnel.
 
 “We have a woman desk in every police station to specifically address the grievances of the women and the desk works 24x7. We also have woman PCR vans running round the clock and have 1091 women helpline number. Moreover, our women and child support unit has trained more than 12,000 women last year and made women aware about all these aspects. Still, if girls feel hesitant, they can always go to the women police station in Sector 17,” said   SSP Nilambari Jagdale, adding that the Chandigarh police have the maximum percentage (18%) of women police personnel.
 
 Moreover, Jagdale said a pick-and-drop service is also available for women in distress.
 
 Interestingly, the study shows that a majority of female respondents have shown faith and trust on police for dropping them home during late night. It was found that if the women have to make a choice between taking a cab/auto-rickshaw or any other source of transportation and Chandigarh Police dropping them, they choose to get dropped by the Chandigarh police. The study also pointed out that there is not enough police patrolling at educational institutions.
 
 The study has suggested the courts should not follow the normal procedure of examining of victims and witnesses repeatedly in the court rooms and rather evidence be taken by way of affidavits. This would shorten the length of the procedure that follows after filing sexual harassment complaints, reducing mental harassment arising out of the cumbersome process.
