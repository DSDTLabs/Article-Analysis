We will consider whether to order complete stoppage of industrial activity in those cities where waterbodies have been critically polluted till the industries set up individual effluent treatment plants or common ETPs,” said a bench of Chief Justice   and justices D Y Chandrachud and  .
 
 Appearing for the NGO, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said the   (CPCB) had issued a report about 77 cities where waterbodies, including rivers, were polluted three to four times more than the safe level. “The groundwater is contaminated, inflicting serious adverse impact on health of citizens. Till date, not a single person has been jailed for polluting waterbodies,” he complained.
