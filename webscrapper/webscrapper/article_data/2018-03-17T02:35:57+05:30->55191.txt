NEW DELHI: A 42-year-old man died while trying to rescue his mother when a fire broke out at their shop and later spread to their house in northeast Delhi’s Maujpur on Friday. Police said the man, Harish Kumar, was on the first floor while his mother was on the ground floor when the fire started. Four others were seriously injured in the incident, police said. 

 The blaze started at 5am and two fire tenders and a police team were rushed to the spot. Speaking to TOI, family members said a fresh fire erupted an hour after the initial blaze was doused. The injured were identified as   (67), Kumar’s nephew, Ghanshyam (27), Ghanshyam’s wife, Neha (24), and their two sons, Abhinav (8) and Anant (5).
 
 “I got to know about the fire a few minutes after it broke out. I live just a few blocks away from my uncle’s house and had planned to have breakfast with him. My uncle’s body was charred beyond recognition,” said Kumar’s other nephew, Prince.
 
 Police said Kumar owned a beauty parlour and a mobile store on the ground floor of the building. In one of the rooms on the same floor, Devi stayed alone, whereas Kumar lived on the first floor with his wife and children. Ghanshyam resided on the second floor with his family. Police said the fire broke out from one of the two shops and was noticed by a neighbour, who alerted Kumar. The blaze was probably trigerred by a water motor, which was left switched on by Kumar’s wife who left for a morning walk.
 
 Kumar rang up Ghanshyam who was on the floor above his and asked him to take everyone to the terrace. He himself rushed downstairs to help his mother.
