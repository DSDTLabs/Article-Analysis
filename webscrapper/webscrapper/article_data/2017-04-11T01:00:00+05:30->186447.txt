PATNA: The tussle between the state government and home guard jawans refuses to end with the jawans announcing to go on indefinite strike again from Tuesday. 

 The jawans had gone on an indefinite strike from March 15, demanding equal pay for equal work. They had also deposited their arms and ammunition at their respective headquarters. However, the home guard jawans had called off the strike on April 5 after the intervention of governor Ram Nath Kovind.
 
 The call for fresh indefinite strike was given by the Bihar Home Guards’ Association after a meeting on Monday.
 
 The tussle took an ugly turn when, despite calling off the strike, the home guard jawans were not allotted any duty. Association president Arun Kumar Thakur claimed that DG (home guard) P N Rai had written to all the district commandants on April 5 not to allot any work to the jawans. 
 
 “We met DG (home guard) to discuss the matter and he assured everything would be normal within couple of days. But nothing such has happened till now,” said Thakur.
 
 Association general secretary Sudeshwar Prasad said the government should allot them duty with due respect, or else they would continue to stage peaceful protests outside their respective district offices.
