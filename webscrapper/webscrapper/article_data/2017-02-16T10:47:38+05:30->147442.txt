HUBBALLI: The devotees later met SP   and claimed that one of them was assaulted by the police. They demanded the SP to suspend the traffic constable. 

 However, the SP denied any kind of assault by the police. By this time, over 5,000 people gathered in front of   police station and started pelting stones. "Four cops were injured in the melee. Despite being injured, inspector Revanna cleared the traffic jam," officials said.
 
 "Eight persons have been detained and three different cases have been booked. Further investigation is on," said Bheemashankar.
 
 Local MLA DG Shanthanagowda, former  , ministers Lamani M Rudrappa and Jalaja Naik and Lambani Samaj leaders rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the devotees. "We had to use tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. The devotees withdrew only after we threatened to fire," the SP added. "We had a tough time in managing the traffic as motorists were stranded for almost two hours. The situation is now under control," the SP said.
