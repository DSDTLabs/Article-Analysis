KESPUR: A youth from Naradeul in West Midnapore’s Kespur, who went to Sydney, Australia for his MBA and later took up a job there, was found dead in his room under mysterious circumstances.

 The family of   Hazra (30), who received the news of his death on Wednesday, suspect foul play.
 
 Chiranjib last spoke to his parents over phone on Friday. His brother-in-law, a businessman, Anup Samanta said, “We couldn’t get through Chiranjib after Friday. Hence, I wrote an email to the company where he worked and the Indian mission in Sydney seeking information on him. On Wednesday morning, the Indian mission replied stating his body was found in his room. The email further said the Sydney police were investigating his death and the body was sent for an autopsy on Wednesday. They would be able to tell the reason behind his death once the reports are out. I requested that the body be sent to us after autopsy.”
 
 The family is expecting to receive Chiranjib’s body in two days.
 
 The youth’s father, Chittaranjan, is a homeopathty doctor-turned businessman. “I want a thorough investigation into my son’s death.” Chiranjib’s mother Malabika said, “My son came home during Durga Puja last year and left for Sydney on October 13. I last spoke to him on Friday.”
 
 One of his elder sisters,  , said, “My brother was a brilliant student. We can’t believe this happened to him.” His other sister   said, “We don’t know how he died. We spoke regularly but he never indicated having any enemies.”
 
 Chiranjib completed his schooling in Naradeul. He then pursued   in Bangalore and went to Sydney for his MBA three years ago. He joined a company in January last year.
