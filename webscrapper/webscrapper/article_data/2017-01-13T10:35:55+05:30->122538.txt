BHUBANESWAR: Perturbed over frequent media reports of bodies being carried from hospitals in undignified manners without the notice of the hospital staff, the health department on Thursday made death certificates a pre-condition for release of bodies from  .

 So far the pre-condition was not strictly implemented. Kin of deceased used to collect the certificates at ease whenever they wanted to, said a senior government officer.
 
 While issuing death certificates, the medical officer concerned will ensure that there is suitable transport provision for the body. The doctor will apprise the relatives of the provision of funds/vehicles for shifting of the body and take their informed consent on a form.
 
 If any relative wants to take the body on self-arranged vehicles, they will make an announcement in a designated form to this effect. Otherwise, the medical officer will arrange the   or make alternative arrangement using government funds.
 
 Every district will have WhatsApp group for constant exchange of information about any death and its transport related issues. 
 
 Ever since the August 24, 2016, night incident of   carrying his wife's body on his shoulders from Kalahandi district headquarters hospital, several similar incidents are being reported in different parts of the state. While some may be genuine, some others may not. With the new provisions, all such unsavoury episodes can be avoided, the officer said.
 
 A day after the Dana Majhi incident, the government launched Mahaprayana, an affordable hearse service. Around a month later, the state government had issued guidelines for dignified disposal of dead prohibiting transport of bodies in manners that compromise dignity such as on shoulders or on a pole. For needy families, the district administration would arrange funds up to Rs 2,000. For unclaimed bodies and medico-legal cases, the government would give money to police (Rs 1,000 for rural and Rs 1,500 for urban areas) for the disposal.
