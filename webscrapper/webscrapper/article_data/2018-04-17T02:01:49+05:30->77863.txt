NEW DELHI: To ensure   in cases related to   against women, the Delhi government on Monday directed the home department to ensure that all   related to crimes against   sent to the government’s   are   within a month.

 Home minister Satyendar Jain wrote to the principal secretary (home) Manoj Parida asking him to ensure that such cases are given top priority. In the wake of the national outrage over Kathua and Unnao rape cases, the government believes this step could be a significant move towards deterring people from committing crimes against women in the city.
 
 “Keeping in view the ever-increasing incidents of crimes against women, all such cases referred for forensic examination need to be attended urgently for earliest completion of prosecution. Accordingly, please ensure that such cases are given top priority and a forensic examination is completed within a month,” Jain said in the order. 
 
 Currently, the samples sent to the FSL are not examined within a limited time-frame, resulting in a delay in the trial. The Delhi government FSL receives a lot of requests from Delhi Police for various forensic examinations required to solve cases of crime. “Even in critical cases involving a serious crime against women, the lab reports in matters forwarded to the Delhi government’s FSL are delayed by months and sometimes even by around a year,” said a Delhi Police officer.
