Nagpur: A former murder accused was stabbed to death in full public view near Shitla Mata temple at Kanji House Square in Yashodhara Nagar on Wednesday. The murder of Pravin Lanjewar (22) took place over a seemingly trivial dispute over sitting in a garden. Two suspects, one juvenile and the other identified as Sheikh Sameer alias Babu (19), fled the spot after stabbing Lanjewar repeatedly. In a late night development, the duo was rounded up from Pachpaoli. While Babu was placed under arrest, the juvenile was handed over to his parents who have been asked to present him before police on Thursday morning.

 Police said that Lanjewar and the accused duo, who have previous offences registered against them, had been having a fight over who would get to sit in the garden. 
 
 Lanjewar, an accused in a murder case, was out on bail since April 11. Lanjewar, along with Shyam Kusre alias Babu and Akshay Mahure alias Montu, had attacked Ravi Satpaise (25) and his friend Govind Sahare (40) in a drunken brawl at a bar in Tandapeth on December 19 last year. Satpaise died in the attack while Sahare was left seriously injured. At the time, it had come to fore that Satpaise and Mahure were running two gangs and Saitpaise was eliminated due to the rivalry.
 
 Police said that Lanjewar, a resident of Fukat Nagar, was sitting near the temple along with his friend Chetan Suryawanshi. Just then, the juvenile and Babu reached there. On seeing them, Suryawanshi fled the spot and the duo caught hold of Lanjewar and attacked him. They stabbed him repeatedly and escaped from the spot.
 
 Crime branch DCP Sambhaji Kadam, who visited the crime scene, said that there could be other assailants as well. “We have recovered Lanjewar’s cell phone and would get call data records details. No CCTV footage was recovered from the vicinity,” said senior PI GM Mujawar of Yashodhara Nagar police station. An offence has been registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by Suryawanshi.
