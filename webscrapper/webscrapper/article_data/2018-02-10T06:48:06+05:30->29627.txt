KOLKATA: Harassment by auto drivers on the Garia-Tollygunge route was apparently nothing new, claimed daily   teacher Puloma Ghosh, who lived at Netaji Nagar. The experience was similarly harrowing for Bansdroni resident  

 “This problem has been faced by all of us at one point or another. Some of us have remained silent. But some others, like the 49-year-old breaveheart, spoke out. One needs courage to protest. We must respect that courage and support her. If the drivers think that shutting down the route will keep us silent, they are wrong. Let them suspend operations, we are ready to suffer for the cause,” said Ghosh. Das told TOI: “We had to walk to the   stations and even rickshaw-pullers made a fortune. But these are small prices we are ready to pay to ensure punishment for the accused,” she said.
 
 Media executive   is still traumatized by an ordeal two months ago. “The driver made such indecent moves that I was get down at Rani Kuthi,” she said.
 
 Even as the autos stayed off roads on Wednesday, commuters were forced to travel by overcrowded buses. This again led to harassment for some. College student Somdatta Chakraborty said, “One of my friends said some men on the jam-packed 80A bus tried to molest women standing near the gate.”
 
  Second-year student   said it was impossible for her 72-year-old mother to travel by bus. “I cannot let her travel alone. We want the auto drivers to resume work as their protest has no taker,” said Dasgupta.
