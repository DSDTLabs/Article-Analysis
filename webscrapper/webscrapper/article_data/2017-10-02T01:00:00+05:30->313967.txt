ARA: Political rivalry between an incumbent mukhiya and a former mukhiya took a bloody turn in Bhojpur district and two murders marred the Dussehra festivities in the district.

 Police sources said in the first incident, 35-year-old Manoj Thakur, son of Ramdev Thakur, the sitting mukhiya of Gaura panchayat under Bahoranpur police outpost of Shahpur block was shot at fatally near Gaura village on Friday when he was returning home at about 8 pm. Manoj was rushed to the sadar hospital at Ara where he succumbed to his injuries. 
 
 In an act of revenge, within 12 hours, at around 8 am on Saturday, about half-a-dozen armed miscreants stormed into the house of former mukhiya of Gaura panchayat Kedar Pandey at Paharpur village and killed Rajnarayan Pandey (80), the elder brother of Kedar, who was bed-ridden. “The octogenarian pleaded to the assailants that he had nothing to do with electoral rivalry but his pleadings fell on deaf ears,” said police.
 
 ASP Daya Shankar reached the spot to take stock of the situation and instructed the local police to be on alert. Bahoranpur outpost in charge Vijay Singh said while an FIR against five named accused has been lodged in the murder case of Manoj, an FIR against six persons has been lodged in Rajnarayan murder case.
