AHMEDABAD: The   has formed a three-member committee to   in colleges, the admissions and even suggest reforms in the examination system.

 A meeting of vice-chancellors, education officials and education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama was held on Saturday. It was decided to change the present system for the overall development of the students.
 
 Senior education department officials said the abolishing the semester system was not discussed. An official said, “UGC has made it mandatory for all universities to adopt the semester system. Abolishing the system would mean a reduction in   grants. One university in Saurashtra abolished the system and the UGC refused to give them grants. The department is simply following UGC guidelines. Instead of abolishing the system, we have to streamline the admission procedure and this will ensure that everything else falls in place.”
 
 One vice-chancellor said it was decided that all vice-chancellors will conduct meetings with students, teaching staff, parents and managements and will prepare a report on the recommendations tabled at the meeting. The recommendations will then be discussed at a meeting with the government. That meeting is scheduled to be held before February 15.
 
 The VC said that the issue was with the admission procedure, which continues till as late as September. This hardly leave any time for the first semester. He said that all VCs openly opposed the present system.
 
 It is worth recalling that the education department abolished the semester system in classes XI and XII. The education minister emphasised the need to improve the quality of doctoral research.
