NEW DELHI: Country's largest carmaker   on Friday hiked prices of its entire product range by up to Rs 8,014 with immediate effect.

 The price hike is in the range of Rs 1,500 to Rs 8,014 (ex-showroom Delhi) across models,   said in a statement.
 
 "The hike in car prices is because of increase in commodity, transportation and administrative costs," it added.
 
 The automaker sells a range of models starting from hatchback Alto 800 to premium crossover S-Cross, priced between Rs 2.45 lakh and Rs 12.03 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
 
 In August last year, Maruti had hiked the prices of its compact SUV Vitara Brezza by Rs 20,000 and that of premium hatchback Baleno by Rs 10,000. On a select range of models, the price hike was between Rs 1,500 and Rs 5,000.
 
 Last year, various car makers like   Motor India, Mahindra & Mahindra,  , Toyota, Renault,   India and Tata Motors had announced hikes in prices of their vehicles from January citing rise in input costs and adverse foreign exchange impact.
