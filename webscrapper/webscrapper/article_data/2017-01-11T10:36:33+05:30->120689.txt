PATNA: A joint team of Patna police and health department officials raided two medicine shops here on Tuesday and seized spurious drugs worth around Rs 20 lakh. Three persons – Sunil Kumar, Bablu Kumar and Mantu Kumar – have been arrested on the charge of selling spurious drugs.

 The police first raided   and Jai Agency on Ashok Rajpath and seized antibiotics, steroids, sedatives and other fake medicines worth around Rs 5 lakh from the two shops. A separate raid was conducted in a flat at Bahadurpur housing colony from where spurious drugs worth around Rs 15 lakh were seized. While Sunil and Bablu were arrested from the medicine shop on Ashok Rajpath, Mantu was arrested from the Bahadurpur flat. Police said the seized drugs would be sent to a government laboratory for chemical analysis. 
 
 The police swung into action and raided the medicine shops after receiving a complaint from a multinational pharmaceutical firm. Drug officials were also involved in the raids. Senior drug inspector Sachchidanand Prasad said employee of a pharmaceutical firm had purchased a drug from Nalanda Medico almost a month back and sent the sample to the firm for test.
 
 “The firm claimed that the drug sample of a particular batch was spurious after which law enforcement agency was contacted. We have seized drugs manufactured by at least six pharmaceutical firms and the samples would be sent to a government approved laboratory for chemical analysis,” Prasad said. 
 
 Police said the three arrested persons were being interrogated. “Sunil and Bablu have confessed that they had purchased the medicines from one Dilip Kumar,” the police added.
