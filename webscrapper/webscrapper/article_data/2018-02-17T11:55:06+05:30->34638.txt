PATNA: The decision of   ( ) to allow MEd degree holders to appear in the interview for appointment as   has come as a pleasant surprise for more than 1000 applicants.

 The BPSC in August 2017 had rejected without any reason the application of all candidates who had secured more than 55% marks in   and qualified the UGC-NET examination. 
 
 Experts claimed the BPSC had rejected the candidature in blatant violation of its own advertisement prescribing master’s degree in the subject with a minimum of 55% marks and NET qualified as the essential qualification for assistant professor. Only those who had passed MA in education examination from some institutions had been called for the interview.
 
 Even teachers working as assistant professors in central universities like Banaras Hindu University, Maulana Azad National Urdu University and Rajiv Gandhi Central University had not been found eligible for the post of assistant professor in the universities of Bihar. Earlier this year, the BPSC had itself found candidates with MEd degree suitable for appointment of lecturers in government teachers’ training colleges in the state.
 
 The BPSC reconsidered its earlier decision and included the names of all the qualified 1,183 MEd degree holders in the list of interviewees, following the agitation launched by the Indian Association of Teacher Educators and subsequent intervention of the authorities concerned.
 
 Patna University syndicate member and State BJP Teachers’ Cell convener   thanked the BPSC for reconsidering its earlier decision and saving hundreds of talented youths from unnecessary harassment.
