CHENNAI: In a major relief to the   government, the Madras high court on Friday dismissed pleas seeking disqualification of deputy chief minister   and 10 of his loyalist MLAs for having defied the AIADMK party whip during the confidence motion moved by   in February 2017. An adverse verdict would have made the EPS government vulnerable to a test of strength in the Assembly. 

 The first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Abdul Quddhose said the court cannot take over the functions of the speaker. 
 
 "Though the power of a constitutional court exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of judicial review of executive or legislative actions is wide, its powers are not unlimited, the court cannot take over the functions of the speaker of deciding a disqualification application by giving full opportunity of hearing to the MLAs sought to be disqualified," the bench said.
