Madurai international airport will soon sport a new look as the airport authorities have taken up decoration work in a major way. The plan is to decorate the walls with paintings and artefacts besides installing statues of famous gods of Madurai. To create a look which is authentic and reflecting the tradition and culture of the temple city, the work has been entrusted to Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited, better known as Poompuhar.

 The   work has already been started. A wall in the international passengers’ area has been decorated with painting and artefacts depicting   temple tower, its car, jallikattu, Lord Alagar’s visit to the city and his entry into the river Vaigai. 
 
 An official from the airport said that they have taken up the beautification following in the footsteps of Chennai airport, which had recently done it. 
 
  director V V Rao said that Poompuhar which has been awarded the contract has just started the work and only 10 per cent has been completed. It would take another three weeks to complete it and the new look would impress the passengers using the airport, he said. 
 
 The airport authorities are also planning to install statues of Meenakshi Amman along with a few other deities. The main statue of goddess Meenakshi will be kept at the entrance to the airport. The beautification is being done aesthetically and reflecting the rich tradition of Madurai. Already, it has started receiving appreciation from the passengers and the general public after the photo of the work’s progress ws released on Twitter, said another official.
