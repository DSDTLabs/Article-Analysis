AHMEDABAD: State-run   Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) has decided to procure 2,000MW of power on a short-term basis, to meet the higher demand for electricity during the  

 The state’s apex electricity company invited bids for procurement of 2,000MW power from April to June.
 
 Power sector players say GUVNL has been compelled to arrange power from other sources, as electricity demand is expected to rise in summer and GUVNL is not getting its contracted power supply from two private sector companies.
 
 “With the increase in demand during the summer months and no possibility of resumption of power supply by these two power giants (Adani Power and Essar Power), GUVNL has floated a request for proposal (RFP) to procure 2,000MW round-the-clock (RTC) power for April, May and June, to meet requirements under short-term power purchase agreements,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy expert.
 
 “At present, GUVNL is managing power supply to consumers with major contribution from the central sector. Moreover, GUVNL has to purchase 49 million units of power from the Indian Energy Exchange at an average cost of Rs 4.25 per unit on March 13,” he added. tnn
