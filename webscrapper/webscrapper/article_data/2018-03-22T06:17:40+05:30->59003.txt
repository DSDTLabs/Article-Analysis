MUMBAI: A day after a   was issued against   Jayant Mehta, the developer appeared before   on Wednesday and said he would deposit Rs 1.10 crore before April 11. 

 Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla cancelled the warrant following the undertaking. The amount was toward money payable as rent to around 40 tenants of a property taken up for redevelopment. The bench was hearing petitions filed by the   - a public charitable trust - which had entered into a development agreement with   run by Mehta to redevelop a property in Kandivli.
 
 Mehta, who appeared in court along with his wife and daughters, claimed they were being stalked online and offline by flat investors. The court asked the Kandivli police to take action if the developer or his family lodged a complaint.
 
 The court had, on Tuesday, issued the warrant after Mehta failed to appear despite court orders. "Prima facie, Jayant Mehta has cheated the petitioner Trust which is the owner of the property; the tenants staying in the 40 tenements; and the flat purchasers who have paid him. He has also indulged in double sale of flats. He has not paid the tenants compensation in lieu of temporary alternate accommodation because of which they are virtually on the streets," the judge had said.
