CHENNAI: An 11-line riddle-rhyme from actor   set twitterati ablaze late on Tuesday night, as it indicated his possible entry into politics.   deftly uses the Tamil word ‘Mudhalvar’ which means chief minister as well a leader. ‘If I decide, I am mudhalvar’, his says.

 The rough transliteration of his 11-line Tamil poem is:
 
 Let us criticise, none is king now. Let us spring up heartily, as we are not kings like them. If routed and dead, I am militant. If I decide, I am ‘mudhalvar’. Am I a slave coz I bow? Am I a loser if I shun the crown? Its an error to shoo them as fools. Paths can’t be seen unless searched. Come along with me, Comrade, one who sets out to smash absurdity will be a leader.”
 
 Kamal’s verse is preceded by a terse statement that English newspapers would carry a ‘message’ tomorrow.
 
 The actor is facing a barrage of criticism, bordering threats of legal action, from several ministers of the ruling   government for having given an interview stating that corruption is all-pervasive in all departments. Some of the criticism from ministers had touched upon Kamal’s personal life, too. The actor, however, has been braving criticism as justifying his Bigg Boss anchor role, too.
