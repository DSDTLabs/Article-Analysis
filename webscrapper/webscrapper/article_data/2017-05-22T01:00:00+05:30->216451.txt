When he was offered the role of a spiritually inclined character in TV show  ,   had expected it to be a soul-baring experience on many levels. What he didn’t know, however, was that it would be a   one as well. The actor has done   for a TV show, which is being made by Sooraj Barjatya’s banner. Akshay says, “I took it as a joke when Sooraj sir told me that I will have to go nude for a sequence. After all, they have never even shown a kiss between the lead pair in any of their shows or films. But when I realised that he was serious, I became quite nervous. I am shy by nature and won’t even remove my shirt to impress a girl, so this came as a shock. The scene is crucial to the storyline, so I decided to go ahead. Though I went nude only for a couple of shots, it was an extremely embarrassing experience. Nobody was allowed on the set apart from the DOP.” 

 Akshay did try to ‘cover up’ by trying stockings and skin-coloured shorts, but in vain. “We tried everything, but it looked fake. We had to show that my character, who is spiritually inclined, doesn’t care about his body anymore. I don’t know how much of it will be shown, but we have done our best to make it look aesthetic,” he sums up.
