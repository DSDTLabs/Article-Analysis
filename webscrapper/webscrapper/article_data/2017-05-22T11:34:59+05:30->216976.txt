NASHIK: The   on Sunday closed the pedestrian  , which was not being used by the people, citing security reasons.

 The   was opened for public in August 2013 to facilitate   to cross the four lanes of the highway and the service roads at Dwarka. However, most of the times the subway was found empty, while the five gates of the five wings occupied substantial space, causing more of an inconvenience to motorists and pedestrians.
 
 The subway connects five points on Dwarka junction -- the service road near Dwarka hotel, Hanuman temple, Dwarka police chowkie, Godavari hotel and the service road opposite Dwarka hotel.
 
 With very few people using e the subway, people’s representatives had suggested that smaller vehicles like two-wheelers and light four-wheelers can be diverted through the subway. However, the idea was ruled out as officials had said that no more construction could be taken up at the site as it would impact the pillars of the flyover over it.
 
 Commissioner of police Ravinder Kumar Singal said, “The empty subway is not solving the purpose for which it was constructed. Instead, alcoholics and mischief mongers are found inside the subway at times. Had the subway been used by a large number of people, there would have been no reason to close it. In the current situation, any kind of criminal activity can happen there.”
 
 Many citizens who happened to use the underpass were unhappy with the experience. Ravi Suryawanshi, a resident of Ramdas Swami Nagar, said, “Once I happened to use the subway, along with my wife, daughter and son. However, after seeing it nearly empty and some beggars staring at us, I decided never to use it. Had there been shops in the subway, like in Mumbai near Chhatrapati Shivaji Station, it could have been used by people.”
