BATHINDA: Moga police on Monday booked five persons for allegedly killing an employee of an oil mill at Bagha Purana town. Those booked include two co-owners of the mill, from where the body of victim  , a resident of Maur town in the district, was found on Sunday night. No arrest has been made so far.

 Raj (28) was working as manager at the mill for the last nearly two years. He was staying in a room in the factory, along with another employee Kuldeep Singh of Burj Dhilwan village. 
 
 His elder brother Bhushan Kumar said, “On Saturday morning, we got a call from the owners of the oil mill, who said that that Raj Kumar had gone missing. We went to Bagha Purana and tried to trace him but to no avail and returned. We again went to Bagha Purana on Sunday and informed the police about disappearance of my brother. While tracing Raj at many places in Bagha Purana, we again went to the oil mill in the evening, where the factory owners and employees did not cooperate with us. We got suspicious and on checking a water tank in the factory found the body floating in it.”
 
 He alleged that the factory owners escaped after Raj’’s body was found from the tank. “We lodged the complaint with the police against owners and others suspected to be involved in the killing of my brother,” Bhushan averred. 
 
 He said a suicide note was also recovered from the room of Raj in the factory, in which it was written that he was dying and nobody was responsible for it. He added that it was not his handwriting.
 
  said, “Oil mill owners   of Maur and Ankur Kumar of Bagha Purana and workers Kuldeep Singh, Harjit Singh of Bagha Purana and Shami of Sangrur have been booked for murder and unlawful assembly. We are sending the suicide note for forensic examination to know who has written it and further investigations are on.”
