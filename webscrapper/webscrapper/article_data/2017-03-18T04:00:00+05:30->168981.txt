Gandhinagar: Gujarat assembly speaker Ramanlal Vora apologized to Viramgam Congress MLA Tejashree Patel after he called her “over smart” in the house. The MLA broke down before her party MLAs who then rushed to the speaker’s cabin.

 On Friday morning, during a debate on the infrastructure development in Aravalli nagarpalika in question hour, the Congress MLA sought permission to ask the government a question, but speaker said it related to cities and not rural areas. Patel is the MLA from Viramgam constituency. However, when she pressed on, the speaker said she was getting “over smart”.
 
 Patel said: “I wanted to know from the government why MLAs were not invited for meetings of the nagarpalika. We have to seek votes from these areas and are answerable to the people of the nagarpalika. The speaker called me ‘over smart’. I did not like and broke down, after which we requested our chief whip Balwantsinh Rajput to raise the issue. Rajput called me out of the house and we decided to meet the speaker.”
 
 She said the speaker later apologized and said that he had no intention of hurting her. Patel said this was not the first such instance. In the past the speaker called her a firebrand and said that she “always gets up to speak in an attacking mood”. She said that she had taken those comments lightly but couldn’t control her emotions this time and broke down.
