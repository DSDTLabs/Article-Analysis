An unsavoury tussle between queue-breaking senior advocates and queue-stuck junior advocates broke out in the courtroom of Chief Justice of India on Tuesday during the chaotic first 20 minutes of the daily ritual of `mentioning' for out-of-turn listing of a petition. Petitions filed in the   get into a queue for listing before a bench when their turn comes.

 But the  , being administrative head, has the power to order out-of-turn listing of a petition if a lawyer convinces him in open court about the `grave urgency' requiring early hearing.
 
  20 minutes before the CJI and his companion judges assemble in courtroom No.1, the queue of advocates for mentioning for out-of-turn listing gradually builds up. When Justice J S Khehar was CJI, the queue was at its shortest, as he used to reject 90% of the requests. But the queue got longer with the benevolent and accommodative nature of CJI Dipak  .
 
 Senior advocates take advantage of this as they do not have to stand in queue like the juniors. Many a time, given the large number of cases that Justice Misra lists daily , the CJI would take requests for early listing for 20 minutes and abruptly end it saying “no more mentioning“. This abrupt ending saw many juniors come back the next day.
 
 On Tuesday , as soon as the CJI said no more mentioning, advocate P V   complained to the CJI that he had been standing in the queue for 30 minutes and his chance did not come to mention a petition for early listing.
 
 Dinesh said, “It was the tradition of the court that senior advocates should not mention petitions for early listing.“
 
 This rubbed the CJI the wrong way . He asked, “No one else knows the tradition? Only you know it? Everyone should learn from you?“ This exchange between the advocate and the CJI gave a fresh impetus to the junior advocates, to make fresh attempts to start the mentioning ritual afresh. But the CJI asked them to stop and promised to look into them to list the cases between October 3-10.
