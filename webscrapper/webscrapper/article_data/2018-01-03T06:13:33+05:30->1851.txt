LUDHIANA: The one-time settlement scheme to clear   dues has so far failed to attract tax defaulters.

 Though the 3-month deadline to avail 10% rebate will end on January 15, only 33,500 out of 1.8 lakh property owners have filed their returns.
 
 The officials claimed that people are expecting extension of deadline once again as the MC polls are round the corner.
 
 As per the officials, the department has received Rs 5.76 crore from 33,500 tax payers who filed their returns since October. Out of this amount, Rs 3.26 crore has been paid by tax payers of current financial year, while Rs 2.5 crore has been collected from defaulters of previous years.
 
 The superintendent of property tax branch (headquarter) said people did not come forward to avail the benefit of the scheme despite the fact that they were offered 10% rebate and there was no penalty and interest on the total amount.
 
 He said after January 15, this rebate will be over and after one month they will impose penalty on defaulters.
 
 The state government had announced 10% rebate and one-time settlement scheme for tax defaulters on October 17, 2017, and people had time till January 15 to avail the benefit.
 
 However, sources said even MC did not try to reach out to the masses on tax payment as they remained occupied in other works in these three months. The staff was occupied in doing the door-to-door survey for preparing the voters lists and verification of the pension and atta-dal scheme forms.
