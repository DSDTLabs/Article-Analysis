New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought the response of finance minister Arun   on chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea to expunge remarks against him by a trial court in a criminal defamation complaint filed by the BJP leader.

  issued notice to Jaitley seeking his reply on the AAP leader’s plea that the observations made by the trial court while dismissing one of his applications should be removed.
 
 Justice   issued notice to Jaitley for his reply and posted the matter for July 13. The trial court, while dismissing the application filed by   and the five Aam   leaders, had observed the plea was “bereft of any merit, malafide and filed solely with a view to stall” the proceedings and dismissed their application on January 30, 2017.
 
 Meanwhile, in a related development, CM Kejriwal also moved another application claiming that some of the alleged remarks attributed to him and other AAP leaders by Jaitley in his criminal defamation case cannot be termed defamatory.
