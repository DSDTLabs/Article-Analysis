NASHIK: Police have decided to tighten the noose around the private security agencies operating in the city, taking a note from the   at her office in Pune recently. 

 Police commissioner   said there are many private security agencies that are not adhering to the norms. The city police has prepared a list of documents to be furnished by the agencies to secure a licence under the Private Security Agency (Regulation) Act and Maharashtra Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Rules, 2007.
 
 “There are many things which security agencies have to fulfil. Those that do not fulfil these norms are running illegally. The companies concerned appoint less educated people as security guards and after taking a certain amount in lieu of the security service provided, only half the amount is paid as salary to the personnel,” he said.
 
 A security agency operator said the norms were very stringent like getting a no objection certificate from 22 police stations to prove that there was no criminal case registered against the applicant. 
 
 The police will be holding a meeting of the security agencies in the city, but insisted that it was planned much before the Pune incident. 
 
 In 2013, the city police had taken action against five security agencies for operating without licence. Their operations came to light when police asked a private security guard about his company and found that they did not have any record.
