PANAJI: A day after a delegation of state leaders shared their grievances to chief election commissioner Naseem Zaidi in New Delhi, the chief electoral officer for Goa, Kunal, on Tuesday, invited representatives of all the major political parties to resolve multiple issues. 

 The political delegation constituted representatives from Congress, BJP, AAP, MGP, NCP,Goa Forward, Goa Su-Raj and ShivSena. The confusion and controversy regarding the voting of the 17,000 government employees through postal ballots was the main focus. 
 
 “Our point of contention was of holding a special camp for government employees to cast their votes as it is no where mentioned in the guidelines,” Goa Forward’s Durgadas Kamat said, alleging that the ruling party had enjoyed undue access to information of the serial numbers of the postal ballots, which it used to its advantage. 
 
 Responding to the allegations, Kunal clarified, in the meeting, that the decision to organize a special camp was taken on Feb 18, three days after holding a meeting with political parties, wherein “the issue of government servants being threatened was raised - the reason why the camp was organized”.
 
 All the parties, except BJP, had demanded that votes cast through postal ballots be scrapped and a fresh polling for government employees be held through EVMs. 
 
 An inquiry was also initiated by the chief election officer on the complaint made by Goa Forward’s   that no information was shared to them in Margao and Fatorda about the time of sealing of the drop boxes for postal ballots. 
 
 The parties also sought clarification on enrollment of military personnel in the voters’ list in Navelim, Ponda, Vasco and Panaji, which went till as late as January 18, when candidates were filing their nomination. The district election officer,  , explained that the whole process was undertaken as per guidelines and Kunal said that since the matter is already subjudice, further comments are not justified.
