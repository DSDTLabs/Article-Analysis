LUCKNOW:   Ram Naik wrote to Speaker of the UP Assembly Hridaya Narain Dixit on Saturday that he was confident notification for Leader of Opposition by Speaker of the previous assembly would be reviewed in the light of new opinion. In a press release, Naik said he had sought the opinion of constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap on the issue of notification of the election for the Leader of Opposition Ram   by outgoing Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey. Naik said Kashyap was of the opinion that the election of the Leader of Opposition was in violation of the Constitution.

 Naik said past tradition in the Assembly for election of the Leader of Opposition or the Leader of House should be discontinued as it violated the Constitution. He also challenged that since 1952, election of the Leader of the Opposition in 14 assemblies was unconstitutional, except in years 1957, ’85 and ’97.
 
 On the last day of the Assembly,   referred the matter to a committee for final decision. Before the committee could decide, Naik came up with expert opinion and advised the committee to decide keeping it in view.
