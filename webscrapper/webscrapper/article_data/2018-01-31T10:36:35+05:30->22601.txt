CHANDIGARH: MC medical officer of health   left BJP leaders fuming in the civic body’s monthly meeting on Tuesday, after he said sacked employees of his department had been hired on “sifarish” (requests) by councillors.

 Bhatti made the statement “councillors ki sifarish per aadmi rakhte hain” (we hire people on requests made by councillors), after BJP councillors   and   had come down on him heavily for firing two employees of the health department. The statement sparked an angry, loud response from the two councillors, and mayor Davesh Moudgil and the municipal commissioner   had to calm them down.
 
 Bhatti had removed the two employees for not performing their duties properly. Both employees had been hired as drivers. 
 
 The councillors questoned the intention behind his using the word when he was asked to explain why the two employees were thrown out of the job.
 
 Earlier, while replying to a question on why both the employees were removed, Bhatti informed the House that the field inspector had sent him a report on the duo’s functioning and he had taken action against them based on the report and followed rules and regulations. “I am not the only one to remove the employee; there is a proper procedure. Action is taken on the basis of the report,” Bhatti said.
 
 Kalia then pressured the officers to rehire the two employees, saying that he would sit on a protest with their families, as they had been facing a lot of trouble period due to loss of job. 
 
 Though commissioner Yadav and additional municipal commissioner   showed sympathy and said they would consider regiring them, Yadav made it clear in the House that an employee would lose his job if an employee doesn’t perform his or her job properly. He said the senior officer of the department concerned had a right to take action as per norms.
