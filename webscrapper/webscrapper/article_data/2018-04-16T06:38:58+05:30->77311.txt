HYDERABAD: The latest crackdown on nursing homes and hospitals reveal that majority of health facilities do not maintain records related to abortions as mandated under the   (MTP) Act.

 Though these irregularities were found at 10 places during inspections, the numbers could be more, say health department officials. While MTP is legal, not maintaining records is violating norms. The officials claim many small centres in the city were blatantly violating norms.
  
  
 “Records are not maintained primarily because MTPs are not done as per law. MTP has become very common and a lot of centres do not even verify the age of the girl/woman. Many MTPs for girls under 18 years are carried out in a clandestine manner,” Indian Medical Association-Hyderabad chapter Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav said.
 
 “Since the girl is a minor, the   does not even come into the picture as it is only applicable to majors,” he added.
 
 Although inspections were supposed to take place following a recent  , the officials said in case of the   case, a whistle blower had informed authorities about female foeticide, infanticide and illegal abortions taking place there.
 
 “MTP is huge business. Tip-offs about violations come to light when there is animosity or agents do not get their commission. Though   Officer (DMHO) has the brief to carry out inspections regularly, there is lack of monitoring by authorities,” a senior health official said.
