INDORE: It was just after 11.30pm on Saturday. Dharmendra Galaase, who was buried under tonnes of concrete but was saved by an air pocket no bigger than his fist, looked up through hazy, blood-filled eyes and screamed, "Watch it, watch your shoes and tools. Don't hurt me any moreâ€¦"

 Galaase is one of only two survivors who made it out of the mound of rubble that was once MS Hotel. National Disaster Relief Force ( ) officers said there could have been more, had the rescue not been "botched up so badly".
 
 Sources said when the NDRF team arrived from Bhopal at 4am, one of the officers was shocked to see the JCB machines and other heavy equipment. Civic workers who demolish buildings were asked to save lives, another official said.
 
 BJP general secretary   on Sunday wrote to the divisional commissioner, stressing the "dire need" to train local emergency response teams.
 
 The initial responders were the locals and passers. About 20 minutes later, equally untrained   (IMC) officials arrived , said witnesses. Soon, State Disaster Emergency Response Force (SDERF) personnel joined them with JCB machines, bearing down on the ofmound of debris where victims may have been clinging into small pockets of air. Their crushing weight may have added to the death toll, said an NDRF officer.
 
 SDERF personnel flouted basic norms of emergency response, like searching with the help of dogs or using Victim Location Cameras (VLC), said an NDRF officer. SDERF blamed the nature of the material used for the construction of the hotel and the manner in which it fell. "Removing debris was not our priority, but saving lives was. The building collapsed like a pancake. In this situation, chances of survival are almost nil," SDERF commandant Rajesh Kumar Jain said.
