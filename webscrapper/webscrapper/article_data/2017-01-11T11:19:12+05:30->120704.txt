 “The entire city was spick and span during the Prakashotsava celebrations. We want the city to remain clean always. We also appeal to Patnaites to cooperate with us in this regard,” said Imam.
 
 The uniformed task force members will also check the use of polythene and diesel gensets without acoustic cover. To be headed by a supervisor each, the task force members will also be imparted training to do their job properly and efficiently.
