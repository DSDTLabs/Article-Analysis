BENGALURU: Former cricketer Anil Kumble’s wife   has filed a cheating case against a private watch company based in Mumbai and a person working at a store in Bengaluru for misusing her PAN card details to conduct fraudulent transactions without her knowledge.

 Chetana  , 49, filed an FIR with the Cubbon Park police station accusing The Time Keepers Boutique Private Limited, Mumbai and Sathya Vageeshwaran, employed with Zimson Watches in UB City of purchasing two watches worth Rs 32.96 lakh using her PAN card details in July 2016.
 
 According to the FIR, the incident came to light when Kumble’s auditor discovered that as per her form 26-AS, she was required to pay Rs 32,956 in tax for the purchase of two watches.
 
 Chetana went to Zimson Watches in July 2016 to purchase a Franck Muller watch costing approximately Rs 8 lakh. The watch was not in stock at the store and was ordered from the Time Keepers Boutique in Mumbai for her, and she furnished her PAN card information for it.
 
 It’s suspected that Vageeshwaran and the Mumbai firm colluded to reuse her PAN details to make other transactions. When STOI called Zimson Watches, a person claiming to be the store manager, said “Vageeshwaran is no longer with us.”
 
 On returning the call immediately, another person claimed the store manager was not at the store. The man, who refused to give his name and claimed to be a customer relations officer, said: “He is a former employee who resigned two and a half years ago.” According to the FIR, Kumble had met and transacted with Vageeshwaran in July 2016.
