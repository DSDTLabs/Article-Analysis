PUNE: A recruitment manager of an IT company in Baner was made to run from pillar to post to register her complaint in a   case.

 The  , however, denied her allegations claiming that she had misunderstood the authorities. Tapasvita Mali (29) from Undri on Wednesday received a call from a fraudster about lapsed reward points and an offer to encash them. She gave her personal details when the person told her he was calling from the bank’s call centre. Within minutes, four transactions amounting to Rs 4,785 each were made. 
 
 Mali told TOI that she got the card blocked, but they refused to stop the transaction even after a request and told her to register an FIR. She said, “I visited the Undri police chowkey, but they refused to accept my complaint and told me to approach the   cell.”
 
 On Friday, she said she visited the Kondhwa police station and met inspector Shrikant Shinde. But he too advised her to approach the cell. “I will file a complaint application at the cyber crime cell on Wednesday,” she added. 
 
 Inspector Shinde said, “It seems she has misunderstood us. She can file complaints here as well as at the cyber crime cell which can directly take up the issue with the bank to stop the transactions.”
