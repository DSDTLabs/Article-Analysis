UDAIPUR: Three people, including two kids who had gone to take a dip in the   at Bheneshwar Dham in Sabla of Dungarpur district, were   away suddenly by the water. The kids had a marginal escape, while a 20-year-old youth died of drowning. 

 The incident took place on Tuesday noon when Rekha (10) and her brother Eeshwar (13) had accompanied their neighbour Ajay Meena (20) to the river to find respite from the heat. Rekha didnâ€™t know to swim and so Ajay was teaching her when suddenly they were swept away in some waves. Eeshwar managed to swim and pulled his sister out from the deep water, however, Ajay drowned. Police arrived later and took out the body from the river which was taken to the community health centre for autopsy. According to sources, the river was flowing and the particular area where these kids were swimming is quite deep. As per a rough estimate, over 12 persons have drowned in the same area in past five years.
