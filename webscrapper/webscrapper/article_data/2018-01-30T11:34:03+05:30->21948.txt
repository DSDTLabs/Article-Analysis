KOCHI: Malayali women may be as literate as men and they may even be earning members in the family, yet spousal violence in case of married women is high at 14.3% in  .

  Family Health Survey report found that round 1.2% women had experienced violence during their pregnancy. The lowest figure was recorded in Sikkim (2.6%) while   topped the chart at 53.1%. In Kerala, almost everyone is literate; 98.7% men and 97.9% women. The percentage of women with 10 or more years of schooling stand at 72.2. Almost 92% married women usually participate in household decisions and 70.6% have bank or savings account they use independently. Nearly 20% women – who worked in the past 12 months – were paid in cash. Also 81% women have a mobile phone.
 
 
 “That is the present paradox. A highly educated and professionally-successful woman in Kerala still believes that it is okay to be beaten or verbally abused by her husband. I have seen that women – who are progressive and working for women’s rights – don’t know how to deal with marital violence in their life,” said woman activist advocate  .
 
 However, experts believe that it wouldn’t be fair to compare Kerala with other states as the rate of reporting in the state is much higher when compared to other Indian states.
 
 “Education is given to a woman to make her a better wife. Earlier, they were woman in the household; now they are a wife in the patriarchal nuclear household. Changes in family inheritance practices is a highly influential and determining factor in increasing patriarchal attitude. The rate of women, who inherit property in the state, has declined but no one ever talks about it today,” said director of the department of women’s studies at Calicut University Mini Sukumar.
