NEW DELHI: The opposition intensified discussions on Friday on amendments to be forced into the President’s joint address to  , moving a step closer to embarrassing the Centre on demonetisation.  , Left and Trinamool are forging common ground on changing the President’s address on three key points — regretting that there was no mention in the speech of over 100 deaths caused by the  , that there was no mention of black money recovered following demonetisation and that there was no reference to what was achieved by scrapping old notes.

 With   discussing the motion of thanks to the President for his joint address, the three opposition outfits have moved amendments. Sources said the parties are discussing which of the changes should be forced by vote. While the total amendments sought run into hundreds, the opposition bloc is likely to focus on those concerning demonetisation.
 
 Not only does the opposition believe that changes in the President’s address portraying demonetisation as a cause of misery to common man will bring negative publicity to the   government, it is confident that a renewed spotlight on the issue will hurt BJP in the ongoing polls. The optimism is reflected in how the alliance mascots of SP and Congress — Akhilesh Yadav and   — are hammering on demonetisation on the campaign trail in Uttar Pradesh. Substance apart, the very success in amending the President’s address is seen as embarrassing for the Centre since the convention is to pass the thanks motion unanimously. The Centre has watched helplessly as the opposition has successfully forced changes in the President’s address during its tenure.
