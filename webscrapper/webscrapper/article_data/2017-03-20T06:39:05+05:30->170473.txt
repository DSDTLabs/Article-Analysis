AGARTALA:   judge justice   said on Saturday that despite challenges, the rate of case disposal over the past three years has been remarkably good in the state. 

 Justice Gogoi was speaking at the foundation laying ceremony of the administrative block of the   high court. "The high court of Tripura has made a remarkable achievement in reducing pendency since its inception in March 2013 - from 6619 to 2883. The case disposal rate is good in the state even though the annual inflow of litigations in the high court and other courts in Tripura is on the rise," he said.
 
 Lauding the 'mega lok adalat' that the high court had organized, Gogoi said judiciary should be made accessible to all not just economically but also geographically. 
 
 Speaking at the same ceremony, law minister   said the state sanctioned Rs 19.17 crore for construction of the administrative block.
