 Coimbatore: Many farmers in   have sold their cows due to lack of  , this season. Chinnaiah Gounder, a farmer from Kunathur in Annur block, owned 40 cows until last year. But now he has only four. “I had no other choice but to sell them. They just reminded me of my inability to feed them. So I sold them off,” he said.
 
 Farmers say that they need a minimum of rs250 per day to feed each  . S Thangarasu, a farmer, said that last year he got 16 litres of milk from each cow. “But this year, it’s a struggle just to get 8 litres,” he said. Thangarasu had six cows of which he sold four. “I bought them for Rs40,000 each but was forced to sell them for just Rs20,000,” he said.
 
 R Ramasamy, another farmer, said 90% of the cows in the region were affected because of lack of fodder. “Even pregnancy patterns of cows have changed because of this. While normally it takes 270 days to give birth to a calf, this year almost all the cows took more than 309 days to deliver,” said Ramasamy.
 
 “We are providing only food waste, palm leaves, dried coconut leaves among other things as fodder. We are willing to even buy fodder from the government if they provide it to us at subsidized rates. But since there was no fodder in and around the village, most of us had to sell some of our cows,” said Saminathan, a farmer.
 
 The farmers warned that if steps were not taken to improve the situation, milk production would be hit. “This would create a huge milk crisis in the future. If Tamil Nadu farmers start selling their cows, the state will have no other choice but to purchase milk from other states at higher rates,” said selvaraj, another farmer.
