CHANDIGARH: Unidentified persons smashed window panes of an   belonging to a tutor in Sector 30 in the early hours of Sunday.

 Ishwar  , the SUV owner, alleged his neighbour resorted to the vandalism as he had lodged a complaint against him for playing music at a high volume around two months back.
 
 Singh said he had parked his Tata Safari near his house on March 24. The next morning he found its window panes damaged around 8 am.
 
 Singh said it was the second time somebody broke his vehicle’s window panes within three months. He alleged the first time   did not register an FIR and now again they were avoiding one. Police said they have registered a DDR (daily diary report) and were verifying the allegations. Singh said there were no CCTV cameras installed near where he had parked his vehicle. On March 17, miscreants set a motorcycle on fire in Ram Darbar’s Phase I in the early hours of March 17.
