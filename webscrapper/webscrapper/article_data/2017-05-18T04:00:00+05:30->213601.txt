Surat: At least 30 people were booked at Salabatpura police station for rioting during a marriage procession here on Tuesday. Members of two communities clashed after stones were pelted on a marriage procession in Rustampura locality by some people belonging to another group, police sources said.

 Police booked Raju Patel, Divyesh, Bhaglabhai, Abdul Razaq Salam, Nazeem Hajrat, Jafar Hazrat, Karim alias Chino and Rahim Hazrat, along with around 23 unidentified persons for rioting. Both the groups later arrived at a compromise but the police still registered an offence on a complaint by an assistant sub-inspector as a preventive measure.
 
 The procession was heading to the venue for the marriage of Raju Patelâ€™s daughter. People were dancing to the tune of Garba in the procession when it reached Rawantad in Rustampura. 
 
 Locals from another community asked the people to stop dance and music which led to an argument between them. It soon snowballed into a violent clash with stone pelting and some accused damaging motorcycles and an autorickshaw parked nearby. 
 
 Police immediately reached the spot and brought the situation under control. All those involved in rioting were taken to the police station but they refused to lodge complaints against each other. However, the police registered an offence and started action against the accused as a precaution.
