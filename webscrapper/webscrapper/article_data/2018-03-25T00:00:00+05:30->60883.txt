Nakul Mathur, MD,  , shares his work-life balance mantra...

 
  It’s often said that it’s wise to switch-off from work when you reach home but it’s easier said than done, especially for a workhorse like me. We have one brain and cannot leave a part of it at work. So, I stopped trying to switch-off. Rather, once home, I leave the phone somewhere and don’t pick it up to check missed calls. Delegating correctly — and not just to save time — can help strike a balance. 
 
 
 Spending quality time with family charges my batteries. Wriggling out of challenging situations with a brainstorming session gives me a high. 
 
 
  Stay grounded, keep calm. Every problem in the world has a solution. 
 
 
 I find it difficult to say NO even if I want to say NO from the bottom of my heart. But I am working on it.
 
 
 Nothing comes easy. I believe that fate and luck are for escapists. There is only hard work and perseverance.
