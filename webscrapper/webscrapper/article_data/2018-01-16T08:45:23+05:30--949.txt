MANSA: A former SAD member was appointed president of the   municipal council on Monday, two days after he switched over to the Congress.   Gora assumed the charge as   chief after he joined the   in the presence of Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal in Chandigarh.

 Former MLA Mangat Rai Bansal and his wife Manju Bansal, who contested the February 2017 election from Mansa assembly constituency as the Congress nominee, were present when Gora took over the president of the civic body. The post had been lying vacant for quite some time.
 
 Mansa MC had been mired in controversies for nearly two years with two factions of SAD trying to get the top post during the previous SAD-BJP government in Punjab. Once in May 2016, the two factions led by the then president, Balwinder Singh Kaka, and party member Gurmail Singh had an altercation at SAD chief Sukhbir Badal’s residence at Badal village, where Gora had sustained a minor injury. 
 
 Gora said, “I was feeling suffocated in the Akali Dal. Now, I will work as per the policies of the Congress government. All 17 councillors of Mansa are with me.”
 
 Meanwhile, Kaka said Gora had stabbed the party in the back to get the civic body’s top post. On the other hand, some Congress workers were feeling upset over a former Akali being made the Mansa MC president.
