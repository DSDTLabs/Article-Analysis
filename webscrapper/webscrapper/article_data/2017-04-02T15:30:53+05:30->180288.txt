Actor   writes songs to help cope with his anxiety and he has found penning his recent track 'Shaking' therapeutic. 

 The 58-year-old actor, who has been battling with the unsettling feeling ever since he suffered his first panic attack following the news his mother was diagnosed with cancer, says writing songs for his band   is the best way for him to address his emotions. 
 
 "I wrote a new song called 'Shaking'. It starts out being about earthquakes in  , but it's a metaphor about anxiety."
 
  
  
 "I find writing songs extremely therapeutic. It is like if my therapist goes on vacation. it's a good time to pick up a guitar and talk about what's going on. I take extremely personal subjects and put them in the songs," Bacon says. 
 
 However, the star believes he is not the only one suffering and has recognised everybody has worries.
