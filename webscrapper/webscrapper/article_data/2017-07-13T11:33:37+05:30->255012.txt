 "Salman and Shah Rukh will shoot together over three days. The number is being choreographed by Remo D'Souza, who has taken a break from the city tours of his reality show to focus on the lavishly mounted song for which a huge set has been erected. Rehearsals have already kicked off and it will be shot at a suburban studio," a source had told Mirror (July 3).
