Behind every successful man or woman is a family that supports his or her dream or vision unconditionally. While plenty is known about Sachin Tendulkar’s life on the pitch the knowledge about his life off it is only peripheral. The Master Blaster’s   'Sachin: A Billion Dreams', produced by Ravi Bhagchandka and Shrikant Bhasi, is eagerly awaited because it promises to take the audience into the Tendulkar home like never before.
Helmed by Emmy Award nominated director James Erskine, the movie, while encapsulating his professional highs and lows, also throws ample light on his personal life revealing aspects of it which have seldom been talked about before. Perceived to be a window into Sachin’s personal space, the film delves into the nature of his relationship with his parents Ramesh and Rajni, wife Anjali, siblings Ajit, Nitin and Savita, and kids   and Sara.
 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams', produced by 200 Not Out and Carnival Motion Pictures, releases on May 26.
