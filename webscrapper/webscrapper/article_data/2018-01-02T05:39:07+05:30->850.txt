GREATER NOIDA: Entrepreneurs can now choose land to set up industries in   from anywhere in the world just at the click of a button. In the race to become more business-friendly, YEIDA has decided to simplify compliance procedures, and ensure transparency in land allotment.

 On Monday, YEIDA launched a portal that has been developed using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping of 650 acres of industrial land in its area. It has also launched an official Twitter handle @YamunaAuthority to address grievances. Both of these IT tools were open for use by Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh in the presence of YEIDA chairperson and Meerut commissioner   and YEIDA CEO  .
 
 According to YEIDA officials, the portal will help entrepreneurs know about the land availability and available infrastructure at existing and proposed sites. “For the first time, we have put the YEIDA Master Plan and sector plan in the public domain,” Arun Vir Singh told TOI.
