JAIPUR: Rajasthan   (RPCC) president   alleged that the state government which has lost its credibility tried to influence the voters by launching Barmer refinery project by the Prime Minister   during the bypolls.

 Pilot said that despite knowing that bypolls are due in January, the state government scheduled the Prime Minister’s programme in a bid to influence the voters. He said, the same refinery project which the   government has been talking with disdain in the last four years has now been termed as landmark project. Pilot said the fact is that despite the project has been delayed for four years, no major changes were in the new MoU. But the project cost has escalated by Rs 6,000 crore. He said, it is very unfortunate that the PM compared drought and   as twins.
 
 Former chief minister   in a tweet said, “PM spent entire time in criticizing previous Congress govt…There is anger and dissatisfaction in public regarding BJP govt’s tenure of last four years. PM’s visit raised some hope in them that something positive will be said but PM didn’t put forward any roadmap. He missed a big opportunity!”.
