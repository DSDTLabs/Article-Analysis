The Swarathma frontman says that it is important for those of us who are aware to cast our precious   for all the right reasons.

 The first time I voted was in   as a 19 year old. I remember being really scared, because there were so many policemen and high security at the polling booth. Everyone was serious and the party people looked like gang members. Before voting, I was given some instructions, so that was intimidating as well. But I felt proud and empowered at the end of it, because I had the right to choose something important. 
 
 Over time, people seem to have lost faith in the system, because it seems that irrespective of who comes to power, the level of corruption is the same. If not corruption, then its communalism, or some other issue that we are left with. The type of problem might be different, but it feels like there is no one person who is honest and right about how they want to run the country. 
 
 The upcoming   election has become more about a particular person and how much caste and religious votes he/she can bring in. Now, we have to pick someone who is less corrupt, not who is not corrupt. There are many people who are not aware and get lured by parties with gifts. Those of us who are aware of such things should vote for all the right reasons. Make that one vote count.
