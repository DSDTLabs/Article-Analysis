 tied the knot with Delhi-based businessman, 
  on May 8. While the 'mehendi' and 'sangeet' ceremony was held on May 7, the wedding was a private affair with only family members and close friends in attendance. But the couple hosted a reception for Sonam's industry friends at a five-star hotel in the suburb on the evening of May 8. 

 
  
 
 While everyone from Sonam's family made it for all the functions, cousin   was missing from the events that were held between May 6-7. However, the actor did attend the wedding on May 8 and the reception subsequently. Ranveer even took to the stage on the wedding day and sang 'Masakali' for his newly-wed cousin, Sonam and her husband. They took numerous selfies which went viral on social media. 
 
 While everything seemed okay, a certain message from Sonam's husband, Anand, got people thinking if all is well between Ranveer and Anand. Anand took to social media to say how Ranveer was not very hapy with his choice of shoes for the wedding day. Anand's message read as, "@ranveersingh wasn't happy about my shoes but he gave me a pass since it was my wedding." 
 
  
  
 Anand chose to wear a cream-coloured Bandhgala sherwani and teamed his outfit with sports shoes which Ranveer did not quite approve of. However, we hope that everything is fine between Ranveer and Anand now. 
 
 Sonam and Anand's wedding reception was attended by almost everyone from the film fraternity. Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Rani Mukerji, Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, Varun Dhawan, Akshay Kumar, Twinkle Khanna, Katrina Kaif, Jacqueline Fernandez, Madhuri Dixit-Nene, Karan Johar and   were seen sporting their stylish best.
