LUDHIANA: It may  , but is true. People living in same houses in Ludhiana have been enrolled as voters of two different areas. In one such case,   of Gurmeet Nagar, his brothers Mukesh and Jugnu are enrolled as voters in Ward 31, while the trio's father,  , and mother have votes in Ward 30. All five have the same address. "It sounds funny, as some of our family members have votes in one ward, whereas others have votes in another ward. I think even the candidates would be confused who are their voters in the family," said Sehdev. 

 According to district electoral officer (DEO) Pradeep Kumar Aggarwal, the only one to blame for the situation were the voters. "The draft of voter list was released about one and half months ago, and the voters could get corrections made in case of errors within seven to eights days of that. The entire process was completed on February 3," he said.
 
 According to a source, a "technicality" could have led to the faux pas, but it refused to elaborate further.
 
 In another such case, half of the family of   resident Hari Om has votes in one ward, while the other half is enrolled to vote in another ward.
