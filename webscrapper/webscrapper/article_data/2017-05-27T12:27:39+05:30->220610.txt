The much-awaited concert of   which took place a few weeks back in   turned out to be a huge disappointment for both media and fans. People paid a whopping amount of Rs 75,000, just watch Bieber lip sync his songs on the big stage, which was a complete shocker.

 This was a clear sign of how Justin did not respect his audience and could think that he could just get away with such miserable on stage presence. A recent report suggested that not only did he mistreat his fans, but also paid absolutely no respect to the unofficial hostess during his stay in Mumbai.
 
 If sources are to be believed,   actress Jacqueline Fernanadez was the hostess and was maltreated by Bieber. According to a friend of the actress the Bieber experience was a “nightmare” for Jacqueline.

 It was quite a surprise for everyone when Bieber left India abruptly in the middle of the night without any intimation to any media houses or fans. After sharing a list of bizarre demands for his India visit, this International pop sensation could actually behave so unprofessionally and mistreat an Indian celebrity? 
 
 Well! This would definitely turn some of the ‘Beliebers’ into “Non-Beliebers”.
