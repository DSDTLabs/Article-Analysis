AMRITSAR: The “ill-conceived and half-baked” bus rapid transit system (BRTS) in Amritsar, as described by Punjab finance minister  , is nearing its competition. The buses for all of its three routes may start plying from end of April even as Manpreet said a group of ministers would find ways to make the venture economically viable.

 The state government had set up   to take up the BRTS and engaged   to carry out the design, tendering and project management for 31km BRTS corridor.
 
 According to the plan, the buses would ply on six, 12, six and 13km stretches on Attari road, Jalandhar road and Verka road respectively. Currently, the BRTS is operational only on two routes—Chheherta to railway station and railway station to Verka on the Attari road.
 
 The BRTS had earlier come under criticism for uprooting thousands of trees for widening of roads. Questions were raised on the success of project after the Delhi government dismantled its BRTS in 2016 but then deputy chief minister   ahead and inaugurated its first phase.
 
 The government had to close down the City Bus Service in Amritsar after suffering heavy financial losses. The government had procured 92 air-conditioned buses for the BRTS but only 12 are plying on two routes while the rest are gathering dust.
 
 Meanwhile, sources in the state public works department (PWD) said they hadn’t received any fresh instructions from the government for starting the project. “We are already working on it. Bhandari bridge is under construction and is likely to be completed in the next two weeks,” they said.
 
 When contacted, PWD executive engineer J S Sodhi said the BRTS was a successful project. “Once completed, there will be three-minute frequency of buses and people will certainly prefer air-conditioned buses for commuting,” he said.
