LUCKNOW: The Investors' Summit has brought back many entrepreneurs to the state who belong to   but have now made a life outside the country. 

 Sanhita Agnihotri moved to the US in 1992. Working as a professor in   before that, she says that vested interests forced her to leave and in sheer frustration, she left the country with the idea of never returning. However, she is back with the objective of setting up projects for solar power and water conversation in UP's villages. "I was born and brought up in Kanpur and want to give as much back to the city as I can. I have set up an NGO, the  , and have adopted a village in   where I have set up a washing powder factory named after my daughter Ena," she says.
 
 Agnihotri says that when she moved to the US, she first had to beg on the streets as she had no work. Then she started purchasing things in bulk and selling them in retail.
 
 “I opened an accounting firm and went on to become a mortgage broker and then an insurance agent. There is nothing I have not done to reach where I am at present,” she says.
 
 Rupesh Srivastava has a roaring business in Michigan. He moved to the US 25 years ago as an employee of Tata Steel and now owns two software companies and one electronics manufacturing company. Hoping for a change in UP after the new government, he is back with a proposal to set up an electronics company, preferably in Lucknow.
 
 “I have been trying to establish a business in UP but there has been a lack of proper infrastructure here. I was in UP in January when I heard about the summit and got excited to see if prospects have changed,” said Srivastava, CEO of Youngsoft Inc.
 
 Sanjay Mehrotra, who left for Japan some 30 years ago, says he never really left and his heart is still in India.
 
 “I went to study and now am a professor. I am keen to invest in UP in the field of electronics and technology but I am yet to finalise a project,” said Mehrotra, who hails from Varanasi.
