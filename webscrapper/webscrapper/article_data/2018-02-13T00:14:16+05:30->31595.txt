Vadodara: The Indian Naturopathy and Yoga Graduates’ Medical Association (INYGMA) inaugurated its Gujarat chapter in city on Monday to raise various issues before the state government which have been pending since many years. The association also elected office-bearers of the new chapter.

 Dr Rajesh Kumar Singh, general secretary of the association, said that Gujarat is the only state in country which does not have state regulation for yoga and naturopathy. “It is necessary that the health department officials of the state government is sensitized and made aware about the successful implementation of yoga and naturopathy into National Rural Health Mission and primary health centres,” Singh added. Singh also said that the government of Gujarat has not done much for getting All India Institute of Yoga and Naturopathy, Central Research Institute of Yoga and Naturopathy and Post-graduate Institute of Yoga and Naturopathy. “All these are central government institutes and are funded and run by Ministry of AYUSH. The state government only has to allot land for buildings of the institute,” he said.
 
 The association members also raised an important issue of nomenclature of degrees given by Morarji Desai Institute of Naturopathy and Yogic Science. 
 
 From 2005 to 2012 the institute conferred Bachelor of Yoga and Naturopathy Science and 2013 onwards the name was changed to Bachelor of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences which is same across the country. Since graduates of six batches have degrees with different names, they are not recognized even when the course taught was same earlier and now, the association has claimed.
