In the first round of assembly elections in five states on Saturday ,   and Goa recorded their highest-ever turnouts of 78.62% and 83% (as of 5pm, according to  ), respectively.

 Both states have traditionally seen bipolar contests, but this time, the entry of  's AAP as a potential third force could be a factor in determining the outcome. The previous highs for the two states were logged in the 2012 polls, with Punjab at 78.2% and Goa at 81.73%.
 
 A very high turnout in the   region, which has 69 of the total 117 seats in Punjab, could well be a decisive factor.EC figures show that nine out of 11districts in Malwa, where AAP is a strong force, saw turnout jump to over a record 80%. Malwa includes three pocket boroughs of the ruling Badal family . While SAD-BJP is fighting anti-incumbency in Punjab, defence minister  's prestige is at stake in Goa.
