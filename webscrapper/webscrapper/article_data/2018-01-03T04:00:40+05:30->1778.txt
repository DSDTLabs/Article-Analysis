KOLKATA: The state government on Tuesday initiated the process of getting rid of touts from Motor Vehicles (MV) offices across the state, including those at Beltala, Kasba and Salt Lake. Among a slew of measures taken are introduction of helpdesks, issuance of identity cards for officials and publication of a citizens’ charter for time-bound services. 

 “Motorists used to suffer a harrowing time at MV offices that are infested with touts. We are making these offices completely tout-free. From now on, there will be helpdesks to guide people. Each and every official will wear an identity card. You can always go to the higher-ups if any one refuses to help,” transport minister   said on Tuesday.
 
 The minister on Tuesday published the citizens’ charter that will help motorists to know the documents required, the requisite fees and time for delivery of services. “The same services will now be available across all MV offices in the state. We are ensuring that an applicant finds it easy to spot an MV officer and receive services without any hassle,” said additional chief secretary (transport)  .
 
 There are 50 MV offices – 23 regional transport offices (RTOs) and 27 assistant regional transport offices (ARTOs) – in  . 
 
 All RTOs and ARTOs will have ‘Citizens’ Charter’, which will have detailed information on various services related to vehicle registration, driving licence, fitness certificate, taxes, permits, forms and fees, on display.
