VISAKHAPATNAM:   such as khaini and gutkha are slowly making their way back into Vizag and other north   thanks to the concerned officials not implementing the ban properly. Vendors are now earning five times more than the original price as the demand is high in the region.

 Despite of regular vehicle checks and raids carried out by the city police, smugglers bring the products to Vizag from Odisha where there is no such ban. “There is no vigilance in Odisha and transporting the material from there to Vizag has become an easy task for smugglers. As per estimations, around Rs 50 lakh worth material comes from Odisha every week,” a circle inspector told TOI. 
 
 City Task Force (CTF) assistant commissioner of police I   said that around 70% of gutka and khaini are generally smuggled in trains. Most of the material comes from Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Berhampur and other bordering areas of Odisha. 
 
 The city cops seize the material at various locations every week. “We seize material worth minimum Rs 2 lakh from either a stock point or from vehicles transporting it. Despite regular raids, unauthorised stock or sale points continue to mushroom on the outskirts,” a senior police officer said.
 
 He further said that cops often arrest the same smugglers more than once, but they have no powers to punish them. The   and the seized material are handed over to food and safety officials, who just impose a meagre fine as per the norms.
