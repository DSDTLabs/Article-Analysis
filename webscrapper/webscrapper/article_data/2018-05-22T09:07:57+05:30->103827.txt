HYDERABAD: From conducting special classes for SSC students to setting a December 15 deadline for syllabus completion, the Hyderabad district   officials are doing all they can to improve the city's pass percentage in 2018-19. 

 In a recent meeting held with various teachers' unions, officials said these decisions were taken to improve Hyderabad district's ranking in Class 10 exams, that's usually restricted to bottom of the charts. In 2017-18, the district stood at 25th position (among 31 districts) with a pass percentage of 75.98.
 
 "It has been decided that special classes will be held in the evening for SSC students starting from August. Also, the syllabus will be completed by mid-December. The education department is also mulling providing snacks to students so they can concentrate better. This proposal is still pending for approval," said  , general secretary of Democratic Teachers' Federation.
 
 He added, "Officials have also decided to conduct a two-month programme for slow learners - from Classes 1 to 8 - so that their performance can improve eventually."
 
 During the meeting, it was also decided that headmasters of schools that secured 100% results this year, will be felicitated along with teachers who managed to achieve a similar feat (of all students securing 100 marks) in their respective subjects. Further, reshuffling of the staff will be taken up soon to ensure that one person is assigned only one charge.
 
 This move perhaps comes in the wake of a recent outburst by gazetted headmasters, who also hold full additional charge as deputy education officer or deputy inspection officer (DyEO/DyIOS). After the headmasters threatened to boycott their additional duties, on grounds of being overburdened, officials promised to bring them some relief, in phased manner, and urged them to continue in additional posts until then.
