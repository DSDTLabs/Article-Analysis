AHMEDABAD: Samarpan Towers, the government apartments allotted to senior officers of the IAS, IPS and other cadres at  , will get   coverage. Sources said city police has cleared Rs 25 lakh for the project. The decision was taken after the alleged delay by the road and buildings department (R and B) over the matter.

 According to sources close to the development, the homes of powerful government officers came on the radar two months ago, when a senior IPS officer’s daughter was assaulted at her home. The case, being probed by an ACP-level officer, has not seen the identification of the assailant or arrests.
 
 “Soon after the incident, a letter was written by city police to the R and B department, requesting installation of CCTV cameras for security of the campus which has 60-odd residences. However, as the project was delayed, police allotted funds for it. The installation may begin soon,” the source said.
 
 R J Savani, JCP (administration), was not available for comment.
 
 The incident took place in November when the IPS officer’s daughter was alone at home. A masked intruder had entered her room and had tried to strangle her. Police launched a major search and questioned staff and residents but did not find any clues.
 
 “Meanwhile, security has been tightened at the apartment complex, with both towers now getting   points in addition to the one at the entrance. Other security measures have also been taken to make sure such an incident doesn’t happen again,” a senior city police official said.
