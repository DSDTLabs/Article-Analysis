BHIWANDI: A 25-year-old woman working as an administrator at a three-star hotel here was seriously injured after two members allegedly belonging to the   gang fired at her on Wednesday afternoon to press their extortion demand. 

 The masked men threw a chit at the reception, where Swara Shirshath had come to check her email, shot her in the waist and fled in an autorickshaw, which they had parked near the hotel. Pujari’s name and his purported phone number were mentioned in the chit. 
 
 Swara looks after the banquet hall booking and other work at K N Park Hotel, near the   highway on the   road. 
 
 Police said she had come to the reception at 2.15pm as Priya Shinde was on leave. The two men entered when the security guard had gone out for a lunch break.
 
 Police said that on hearing the sound of the firing, other hotel staff rushed towards the reception counter and found the victim lying in a pool of blood. Staff rushed her to a nearby private hospital, where she is undergoing treatment.
 
 Sources said the hotel owner, Prakash Shetty, was receiving threat calls from Pujari for two years. He had last year filed a complaint with Hill Line police in Ulhasnagar, where he resides. An anti-extortion cell official said   had informed them about a threat call six months back. 
 
 The incident has shocked other businessman in Thane region as in three years, Pujari has allegedly made over 50 threatening calls to businessmen, demanding extortion money, and he had twice fired at two persons. Cable operator   in Ulhasnagar was killed for not paying Rs 5 crore as extortion money, while a builder’s office staff was injured in Ulhasnagar. 
 
 Thane police have formed six teams comprising local police, anti-extortion cell and   crime branch officials. DCP (zone II) Manoj Patil said Shetty had complained to Hill Line police.
