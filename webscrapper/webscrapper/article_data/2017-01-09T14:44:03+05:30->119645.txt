‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ was a visual delight and Anushka Sharma’s style in true sense was contemporary in the film. Speaking to Bombay Times, Anushka recently spoke about how important it is to have a strong   in a   film, “I guess he is the only one who takes care of it. Otherwise I think I am decently stylish but of course for Karan it’s very important. The way his characters look and the way they are it is very important and I think people even watch his films for that.”

 Anushka also spoke about how she enjoyed the entire process where people paid a lot of attention to her look in the film, “I really enjoyed it quite honestly. I have never done a film in which someone is so bothered about the way I am looking. I have always done films like ‘Band Baaja Baraat’ or even a ‘Sultan’ where you know your clothes don’t even matter. But here in Karan’s films usually your roles are character based.” 
 
 Anushka also spoke about how she doesn’t really mull over fashion and is a big fan of street shopping, “I am a big fan of street fashion. When I travel abroad, I look at people on the streets and observe what they are wearing because that’s where fashion comes from. Everyone in the business even the designers are taking it from there. So I am very observant of people and how they dress and I often say that, to me that’s ultimate fashion. I am not too deep into brands and labels.”
