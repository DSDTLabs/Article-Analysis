Panaji: A full-time nephrologist will be appointed to restart kidney transplants at Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim. Kidney transplants at GMC have come to a standstill since prof J P Tiwari, a senior nephrologist, attached to the hospital, went on a sabbatical in October, last year. Addressing a press conference on Friday afternoon, health minister Vishwajit Rane said Dr Shital Lengade, a nephrologist, will be appointed to work full time at GMC.  Though Lengade was appointed a while ago, the terms of his appointed were unclear, and no transplants have been conducted, even as four new cases for transplants are listed at GMC. Rane said four cardiologists will be appointed so that the department can carry out procedures in a time-bound manner.
