Thiruvananthapuram: The state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau gave a clean chit to former chief minister   and former   minister   in a petition pertaining to alleged irregularities in the spending of Karunya benevolent fund. 

 Vigilance, in its quick verification report submitted to the   here on Friday, said there was no proof against Chandy, Mani, additional chief secretary   and former lottery director. But, the VACB in its report expressed doubts of suspected siphoning of Karunya fund by middle men. The report also pointed out discrepancies in auditing as a major flaw.
 
 Though rules stipulated that only one percent of the fund should be used for administrative purposes, more money was spend for the purpose in 2012-13. Siphoning of money is suspected as the one time assistance was increased from Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000. Only further probe would reveal whether the irregularities took place at the panchayat level. Proper auditing was not carried out even for a single year.
 
 The vigilance special court had ordered the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to conduct a preliminary inquiry into a complaint filed by one Suresh Kumar, a native of Malappuram, who in his petition stated that though the lottery scheme yielded Rs 1,969 crore, the benefit did not reach beneficiaries.
 
 The Karunya scheme or the Karunya benevolent fund was devised by the government in which the proceeds from the lottery is provided to those who are suffering from serious ailments.
