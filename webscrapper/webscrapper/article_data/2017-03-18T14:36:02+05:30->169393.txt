Anil Kapoor, while shooting for his upcoming wedding comedy in a London gurudwara, bumped into 105-year-old Fauja Singh; the fitness enthusiasts chatted for a few hours.

 Anil Kapoor, who is in London for a 50-day schedule of Anees Bazmee's wedding romcom Mubarakan, which also features AK's nephew Arjun,   and  , had a curious encounter recently while shooting a scene in a gurudwara. The 60-year-old fitness enthusiast met British-Sikh centenarian  , a marathon runner. The duo chatted for a couple of hours in between shots.
 
 A source revealed, "Anil is a fitness freak himself and they bonded on that front. He spoke to Fauja Singh about how keeping himself a positive, happy and simple person while the marathoner shared views on running. Fauja Singh, who is also known as 'Turbaned Tornado', complimented Anil on his sardar look, adding that he likes to see lean and fit sardars on screen. The veteran athlete showered blessings on the movie as a parting shot."
 
  
  
 Anil told Mirror from the Queen's City, "I was pleasantly surprised to meet Fauja Singh. He is a delight to talk to and his story is an inspiration for all of us. I'm completely infected by his energy and charm."
 
 At the age of 100, Fauja Singh attempted eight world age group records at the special Ontario Masters Association Invitational Meet, held at the Birchmount Stadium in Toronto. He ran the 100 meters in 23.14 seconds, the 200 meters in 52.23 seconds, the 400 meters in 2:13.48 minutes, the 800 meters in 5:32.18, the 1500 meters in 11:27.81 minutes, the mile in 11:53.45 minutes, the 3000 meters in 24:52.47 minutes and the 5000 meters in 49:57.39 minutes, setting five world records for his age group in one day. Some events had no previous record holder, as nobody over age 100 had ever attempted the distance. Some of his marks are significantly superior to the listed world record in the M95 age group.
 
 Three days later, on October 16, he became the first 100-year-old to finish a marathon, completing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 8:11:06 minutes. The Guinness World Records has refused to acknowledge the record because he could not produce his birth certificate to prove his age as birth records were not kept in India in 1911. He was able to produce a passport listing his DOB as April 1, 1911, and a letter from Queen Elizabeth II congratulating him on his 100th birthday.
 
 In 2012, he carried the Olympic torch and three years later was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to sport and charity. When quizzed about the fitness tips the duo exchanged, Anil laughed, "It's amazing to see how a man his age has discovered an elusive fountain of youth. He shared his fitness insights with me which I plan to keep to myself."
