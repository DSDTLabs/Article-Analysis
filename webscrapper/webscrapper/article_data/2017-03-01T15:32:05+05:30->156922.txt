 and family including father   and cousin 
  attended the wedding of her cousin   in Abu Dhabi. While it was a family affair with lots of fun and nach-gana, the doting sister sat down to write a heartwarming message to the groom. 

  
  
 Sharing a lovely picture from the baaraat to her Instagram page, Sonam wrote, “Dear @akshaymarwah22 I love you bhai, you are a lucky soul to understand the meaning and need for a partner to share all your ups and downs of life with. Life is so much better when you have someone who loves you and who you can love in return. I'm so proud of you that you had the courage to choose that. I was moved to tears with the joy and expectation I saw on your face when the baraat moved towards the mandap. @aashitarelan16 is one lucky girl. I hope your journey forward is beautiful and filled with life! I love you both. #akmash #bhaikishaadi.”
