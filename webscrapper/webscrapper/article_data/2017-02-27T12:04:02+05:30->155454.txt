HYDERABAD: The   on health and family welfare for 2015-16 has revealed that the per capita expenditure on health in Andhra Pradesh and   together stood at a low Rs 731. This places the two states at the sixth rank among non-special category states.

 Telangana, whose health   for 2016-17 was Rs 5,967 crore, stands third among the southern states in health spending. Kerala is at top with Rs 1,057, followed by Tamil Nadu with Rs 839. 
 
 The report, however, said there has been a mild increase in   by state governments after the 10% increase in their share of central taxes as per the   recommendation. The central government had hiked the states’ share to 42% from 32%. Even after this, the per capita expenditure on health remains low.
 
 “It is noted that there have been considerable delays in transferring of funds from state treasury to state health society,” the report said. It also observed that as public health is a state subject, the implementation of approved plan under the   (NHM) depends upon the implementation capacities of the state/union territory. The implementation capacity of many states is low, particularly in respect of civil construction, procurement of drugs and equipment, engagement and management of human resources such as doctors & specialists, and coordination between urban local bodies and health department.
 
 The report urged all states to strengthen district hospitals, including developing them as training sites, scale up free drugs and diagnostics initiatives, turn sub-health centres as ‘first port of call’ and scale up new vaccines. 
 
 Currently, there is a 11.9% shortfall in allopathic doctors at PHCs. Specialist doctors at CHCs have increased from 3,550 in 2005 to 4,078 in 2015. However, there is still a shortfall of 83.4% surgeons, 76.3% obstetricians & gyneacologists, 83% physicians and 82.1% paediatricians.
