MUMBAI: P N Sreenivasan’s family realized something was wrong when he did not call them from his office.

 “He always calls home on reaching his workplace. Today, we did not receive any call. We realized that there could be some problem. Then the messages about a missing chopper with senior   employees on-board started pouring in,” said son Arjun   (29). This was around 12.30pm. The family resides in   in Bandra Reclamation.
 
 Fifty-eight-year-old Sreenivasan, deputy general manager with ONGC, was due to retire next year. His brother-inlaw Rajendran, who works with the revenue department in Thrissur, Kerala, said he got details of the mishap from TOI and was in a state of shock and disbelief. “I’m trying to fly to Mumbai tonight itself,’’ he said. The family is originally from Thrissur.
 
 Sreenivasan is survived by wife Jayashree, son Arjun who works for a bank and daughter  , who is pursuing her management studies from IIM-Ranchi. His father, P A Narayanan, said he learnt of the tragedy on television. “I came here in the afternoon from Andheri. He was my second son. My elder son lives in Kerala.” A family friend said his daughter was on her way home from Ranchi. “ONGC officials did ask me about a locket that he was wearing. I am not sure if they have yet identified him but I believe they have,” said Arjun. 
 
 Sreenivasan’s wife was attended to by a doctor late on Saturday. “While the family was hoping against hope for his safe return the entire day, Jayashree lost confidence at night,” said an ONGC employee.
