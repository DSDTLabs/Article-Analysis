DHARAMSHALA: In a new initiative,   police undergoing with a campaign against drugs in Kangra district has started a drive of rehabilitation efforts for drug addicts in the region which is helping them converting addicts into sources to catch the drug peddlers in the area.

 Drug addicts are counseled and interviewed about their tryst with drugs. Cops are also asking about the routine amount spent by them to buy drugs and about sources from where they use to get these drugs. The initiative was started this week.
 
 Many of them have told police that women are contributing to increase the customer base in drug trade. Peddlers use to give them drugs free of cost and later they got in habit of this practice. “It was one aged female that offered me drugs free of cost. But later I got addicted to it,” said a drug addict of   area. 
 
 A garment shop owner in   area have told police that he was earning rupees 1000 a day and he spent Rs 800 on procurement of a drug called as–Chita. “I suggest youths to never try this Chitta drug, I did it with my friends first. But later I got so habitual of it that I was unable to move out from my bed without having it,” he said.
 
 Sanjeev Gandhi, superintendent of police told that this initiative has been started with a view to eradicate the drug trade from roots. He said that police has got the information through many villagers of the region, particularly females, that school and colleges are being targeted to increase the customer base.
 
 “By this exercise these addicts are getting chance to make a u-turn in their lives. Many of them are young and are from good families. There are instances where they have fell in prey while getting professional education in other states,” he said.
