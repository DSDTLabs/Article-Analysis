KOLKATA: Bharatiya Janata Party president   is likely to reach Kolkata on April 7 during his two-day trip to West Bengal. Shah, who is visiting the state ahead of the panchayat polls in Bengal, is slated to start his tour from north Bengal. 

 "His tour itinerary has not been finalised, but he will meet   workers in at least three-four party delegates' programmes. We are expecting a large number of people to join BJP during his visit," said a BJP leader on Tuesday.
 
 Meanwhile, the state BJP has received a provisional permission from the department of youth services and sports to organise a programme at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on April 9. Earlier, BJP leaders had alleged that they were denied a permission to hold the meeting at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on April 9, in which Shah is scheduled to speak to party workers and supporters. In the provisional permission, issued a few days back, the department has said that a final permission to hold the meeting can only be given after the organisers get other permissions from different departments.
 
 Earlier in September last year Netaji Indoor Stadium had cancelled permission to Shah's event while Mahajati Sadan denied permission to a programme scheduled to be chaired by RSS chief  .
 
 "They have asked for a number of permissions from us and we have applied for those permissions. Let us see if they allow us to hold the meeting there," state BJP president   said on Tuesday.
