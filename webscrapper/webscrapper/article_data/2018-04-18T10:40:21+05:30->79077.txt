GUWAHATI: Police are yet to make any headway into the incident of suspected   of the 35-year-old woman who was found in a battered state in the city's   area on Monday. Even a day later, police are yet to discover the circumstances of the crime or the identity of the culprit. The victim's medical reports are still awaited and police are waiting for her full recovery before asking her to testify. 

 A senior police official said, "The woman's   is improving but she has not been able to tell police about the whole incident. Her recovery and testimony thereafter is vital to know the details of the case." The cop added that she had spoken to the police in hospital but she has not divulged anything specific about the incident yet.
 
 The woman went missing on Sunday night, when she was known to have gone with some friends to a Bihu programme. 
 
 The victim's 16-year-old son, who is the only other person in her house, asked police to find out the identity of the person she had gone to visit on Sunday before she went missing. He has told police his mother used to often visit an unidentified person at Gorchuk on Sundays for counselling.
 
 "Usually she returns by 10 pm. When she did not return on Sunday night, I tried calling her. But she could not be contacted. Her mobile phone and other items like ATM cards are also missing," the son said.
 
 Family members believe the culprit is someone who is close to the victim.
