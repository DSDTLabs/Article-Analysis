Rajkot: A 22-year-old man was killed over an issue of illicit relationship in Dihor village of Talaja taluka in Bhavnagar district on Sunday night. His body was found on Monday morning. 

 According to police, the body of Anil Baraiya (22), a resident of Dihor village, was found on Monday morning. “As his body bore deep cuts, we suspect that he was killed with sharp-edged weapons on Sunday night. The incident seems to have occurred while Baraiya, a farm labourer, was going to water the farm where he used to work,” said an investigating official from Talaja police station. 
 
 Meanwhile, Baraiya’s brother Kishor (24) has approached the police with a complaint. “In his complaint, Kishor has named Sunderji Dhandhala as suspect in the case. Dhandhala allegedly had an affair with the sister of the Baraiya brothers. When Baraiya came to know about it, Dhandhala decided to bump him off, alleged Kishor in his complaint,” added the official.
