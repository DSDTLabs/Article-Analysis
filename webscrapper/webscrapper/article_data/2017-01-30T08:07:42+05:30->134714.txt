MUMBAI: A trader from   who was flooded with coins of Rs 10 to the tune of Rs 19,000 received from customers after the November 8   move has been running from one bank to another to get them deposited, but without any success.

  (31) sells tailoring material like buttons, threads and laces. Since a week, he has been unsuccessful in depositing these coins at two nationalized banks with which he has accounts since four years.
 
 “I have been visiting the two banks with the coins weighing more than 14.5 kg but they are refusing to accept them, said Shaikh. The branches of both banks, he said, are located in Vasai (east). Deposit slips of banks usually have a column for coins and existing rules require them to accept coin deposits.
 
 According to Shaikh, the tailoring items that he sells cost anywhere between Rs 2 and Rs 20 due to which he ends up getting coins. Prior to demonetization, Shaikh said he used to receive nearly Rs 300 in coins from customers every day . “After demonetization, my daily collection of coins has increased. It has gone up to Rs 900,“ said Shaikh.
 
 He added that while coins of Re 1, Rs 2 and Rs 5 are returned to customers as change, his stock of Rs 10 coins has gone on multiplying.
 
 Even four days after the announcement of the plan to demonetize notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 was made, Shaikh had gone to deposit Rs 12,000 in coins, most of them in Rs 10.While the bank had refused even then, a customer who had received the then newly released Rs 2,000 notes willingly exchanged the new note for the coins.
 
 For now, Shaikh keeps requesting his customers not to give him coins for a while.
