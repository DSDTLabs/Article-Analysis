JAIPUR: The government proposal to increase the retirement age of doctors from 62 to 65 was met with serious opposition by the Senior Resident Doctors’ Association (SRDA).

 Senior resident doctors alleged that the state government has not been advertising posts of assistant professors in medical colleges. And now they are shutting the young doctors away from government jobs by increasing the retirement age of senior doctors.
 
 “We are completely against the proposal by the government to increase the age of retirement of doctors. The shortage of doctors in medical education department, medical and health services cannot be met by this decision. The government should increase the number of posts of assistant professors in medical colleges. Otherwise, after three years, the shortage of doctors will further increase,” said Dr  , president SRDA, SMS Medical College.
 
 He said that they have written to chief minister   urging her not to go ahead with the proposal. “We will meet the governor and key government officials to prevent the government from increasing the retirement age,” he said.
 
 According to the   (MCI), senior resident doctors are those who are doing residency after obtaining PG degree (MD/MS) and below 40 years of age.
