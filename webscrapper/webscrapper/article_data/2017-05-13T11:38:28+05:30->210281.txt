PUNE: The forest department will soon acquire 12 more cages for the   to ease the process of capture, treatment and release of the wild cats. 

 As per chief conservator of forests (CCF) – territorial for Pune, Vivek Khandekar, “The 34 existing cages at   have been running full. Owing to the sugar cane harvesting season, many leopards will be found in these farms. The new cages will come handy for the rescuers to carry on with their works.”
 
 As reported earlier, most of the holding capacity of the centre was being used to house leopards that have spent enough time in captivity to not be able to survive in the wild. Speaking to TOI, senior veterinarian at the rescue centre Ajay   said the forest department has sanctioned 10   and 2 cages specifically for cubs. 
 
 The process for building these should be over in the next two months. 
 
 “The current cages are already full. Because of this, when new leopards are captured, they are released immediately in the wild if are fit. Also at times, we have to get few of the older leopards in the same cage for about 10 days until the new animal is treated and released. In certain situations, we have to even keep the animal in a trap cage,” Deshmukh said.
