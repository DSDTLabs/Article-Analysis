SURAT:   has initiated   against a   in the city, claiming fraudulent use of   inclusion mapping technology and software.

 The legal proceedings have been initiated by company’s subsidiary Galatea following long-term discrepancy between weights of rough stones the Galaxy system was processing and those the manufacturer was reporting to the company during the monthly audit. 
 
 The company authorities in India, however, refused to comment on the legal proceedings. 
 
 Meanwhile, the US-based Rapaport group reported that Sarin’s client in Surat was consistently underplaying the technology. Rapaport further stated that an internal analysis by Galatea revealed that the manufacturer had managed to hack the Galaxy software to manipulate the weights it reported. 
 
 The news on Sarin’s legal proceedings against the diamond company has rocked the world’s leading diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat. This is first-ever case where Sarin has gone ahead with legal proceedings against the Surat company for infringement of its intellectual property rights (IPR). 
 
 Rapaport quoted the company’s CEO David Block saying, “The Sarin group is taking proactive and aggressive actions aimed at protecting our intellectual-property rights.” Sarin Technologies has been selling more than 85 per cent of its diamond-related equipment and advanced softwares in India, especially to diamond manufacturers in Surat. Last year in March, Sarin opened ‘Sarin House’ in the city’s A K Road spread over 55,000 square feet area and employs around 400 staff members.
