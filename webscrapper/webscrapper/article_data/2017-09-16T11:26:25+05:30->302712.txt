RANCHI: Second-placed   beat   39-28 to secure their eighth win of the season in a Zone 'A' clash of the Vivo Pro Kabaddi Season 5 clash, here, at the Harivansh Tana Bhagat Indoor Stadium.

 In a match played earlier in the evening, it was a sublime home debut at their new base for the   as the defending champions got off to a winning start with a thumping 46-30 victory over Telugu Titans. Mumbai outfit, who had started the evening with poise and purpose, appeared clueless halfway through against a stoic Fortunegiants team.
 
 Raider   put U Mumba ahead after Sachin opened the scoring for the Fortunegiants. While Adake held his own, his skipper   could hardly get going against a formidable Gujarat defence. While   and Adake kept the Fortunegiants at bay, the former champions clearly lacked the edge in the first half. With Sachin and   garnering points with regularity for the Gujarat outfit, Anup & Co's grasp over the match seemed to be slipping away.
 
 With the Fortunegiants slowly pulling away, Anup put his defensive skills to test against rival skipper Sukesh Hegde. Down to three men, Anup dished out a superb toehold to bring back the Mumbai team back into contention. Rajput and Sachin though gave little away as U Mumba continued to fire blank upfront. With Sachin pulling off a super raid in the dying minutes of the game, Mumba could only look back at the moments they had lost.
