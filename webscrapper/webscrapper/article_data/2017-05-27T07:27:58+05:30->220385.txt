SECUNDERABAD: No sooner had chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao made public his intentions of acquiring the   and Gymkhana Ground for housing the new Secretariat, that sleuths of the state intelligence wing got cracking on collecting details of the two grounds from the local defence authorities. 

 The intelligence wing sleuths have begun collecting details on the extent of the two grounds as well as the access infrastructure like road and rail links to the proposed new Secretariat site.
 
 Sources in the defence department said the intelligence cops are assessing the advantages and disadvantages of setting up the Secretariat on these grounds not only from the security perspective but also from the general public's point of view. The sleuths are also taking stock of the number of vehicles passing through the stretches adjacent to the two grounds.
 
 "We have given details of boundaries of the Bison Polo Grounds and Gymkhana Grounds to the intelligence wing cops," confirmed a defence department source.
 
 Once the state government gets clearance from the Union defence ministry about allotment of Bison Polo and Gymkhana grounds, the proposal can go ahead only after the   (SCB) passes a resolution to the effect. The   comprises of the president cantonment board (PCB), a brigadier rank official, elected members of all eight civilian wards as well as official of defence wings like military engineering services.
 
 The reason: both Bison Polo Ground located on GLR Sy No: 708 and Gymkhana Ground on GLR Sy No: 712, have been reclassified. Till 2015, the Bison Polo Ground fell under the 'A-1' Defence land category (under active occupation of the army) and Gymkhana Ground were under B-4 land category (defence land vacant).
 
 In 2016, both grounds were reclassified and transferred to SCB. The SCB then categorised them as class 'C' (Cantonment) land. According to SCB records, the extent of the Bison Polo Ground is 37.56 acres and Gymkhana Ground is 23.65 acre.
