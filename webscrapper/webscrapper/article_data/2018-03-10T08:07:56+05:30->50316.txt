MYSURU: A day after clearing the proposal to give   an independent flag, chief minister   on Friday said it’s different from the   flag. “The state   will be used during official events hosted by the state government,” he said.

 According to him, the Kannada flag will remain which pro-Kannada activists can continue to use. The Kannada flag has two colours, while the state flag has three with the state government emblem in the centre.
 
 
 “We’re proposing that the state flag will be used during official events like the Kannada Rajyotsava. The rules are being framed to ensure it gets due respect like the national flag,” he said, adding that it cannot be used everywhere. It’ll have a code for use, just like the national flag.
 
 In Bengaluru, BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa criticised the government for politicising the Kannada flag issue. “For four-and-ahalf years, what were they doing? With elections 40-50 days away, the government has suddenly woken up to Kannada pride and the flag. This is nothing but politicising the sentiments of Kannadigas,” he said.
