AHMEDABAD: A total of 2,301   (LRD) jawans participated in the   at Ahmedabad city police headquarters in Shahibaug on Thursday morning. The jawans were under training for past eight months with the city police. Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, MoS (home) Pradipsinh Jadeja, senior state   and police officials were present at the event.

 According to state police officials, this is the largest passing out parade for the state police. In 2017, the state police in its biggest recruitment drive had recruited18,000 personnel. A high number of LRDs inducted on Thursday possessed graduate degrees, said police officials.
 
 Vipul Aggarwal, additional CP (administration), said 1,000 LRDs will be allotted to city police’s traffic branch, almost doubling its strength. “The new recruits will be a shot in the arm for the force as they would be filling up most of the present vacancies. Traffic branch has been given the lion’s share due to its need for the manpower,” he said.
 
 Another 1,301 LRDs were evenly distributed across the city’s 50-odd police stations, averaging about 26 LRDs for each. The LRDs were given their posting from the city police headquarters late on Thursday evening.
