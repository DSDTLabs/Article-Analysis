NASHIK: A month has after the   awareness drive organised by the city police and the regional transport office, there is no major visible improvement in the driving sense of  . 

 This year till February 24, the police have registered 29 fatal accident cases — the same number during the corresponding period last year. Senior police officials said the main cause of the accidents was negligent driving by motorists.
 
 Nonetheless, the overall accidents have reduced as this year only 76 cases have been registered as against 104 that were registered last year from January 1 to February 24. 
 
 The police have taken various initiatives to ensure that people follow traffic rules so that the rate of accidents can come down. Considering the large number of deaths in road accidents, the city police have also made use of helmet compulsory for two wheeler riders.
 
 Though the response from two-wheeler riders is lukewarm, the police have decided to ensure that in the case of a fatal accident of a biker, they would be making a specific entry in their register mentioning if the deceased was wearing a helmet or not. 
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Jayant Bajbale said the aim was to ensure that two-wheeler riders start wearing helmets as if the police mention in their register that the deceased was not wearing the head gear at the time of the accident, the chances of getting the insurance claim would be nil. 
 
 But there’s still a large number of bikers seen riding their vehicles without using the safety gear. The traffic police said that they have also identified spots prone to fatal accidents for necessary preventive measures. 
 
 A couple of weeks ago, a truck rammed into a tree that was located right in the middle of the   in the jurisdiction of Mhasrool police station. 
 
 Senior police officials said they have noted down the problems of all the accident-prone spots and proposed necessary work to the civic administration.
