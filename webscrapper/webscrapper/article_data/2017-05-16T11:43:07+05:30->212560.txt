LUCKNOW: Most of the districts in UP are facing a cash crunch as the ATMs have gone dry.

 In Allahabad, people were in for a rude shock on Monday when most ATMs in the city were either shut or were out of cash. Public sector banks, which opened on Monday after the weekend, have put a cap on withdrawals ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 3,00 to meet 'emergency needs' of their customers. In many areas of the city where ATMs could not be refurbished with money over the weekend, the machines ran out of cash again by noon on Monday.
 
 In  , people were seen standing in long queues outside ATMs. Many rued that the situation was strangely similar to the period following demonetisation in November last year. Barring two to three ATMs, most ATMs in the district were unable to dispense cash. For instance, in areas like Engineering College,   Road, Alinagar and Jubilee Road, only a   near the public sector bank's main branch in Railway Colony was functional.Many people who had queued up at functional ATMs had to return empty-handed because of the scorching heat.
 
 In Jhansi, locals have been spending hours standing in long queues. Most ATMs in the city are either non-functional or are have run out of cash. Bank officials, meanwhile, blame the Reserve Bank of India for not supplying them with ample cash to meet the needs of customers.
 
 Manager of currency administration cell of State Bank of India, SK Singh, said, "Around 33 ATMs are functioning under the main branch of   and another 10 in the separate branches in the city. These ATMs are dealing with a cash crunch, as the RBI is not releasing enough cash. As a result we are managing with the limited supply which is being distributed in small quantity."
