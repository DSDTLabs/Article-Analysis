Ahmedabad: A technical glitch in allotment of seats for the postgraduate medical courses in all India quota left many students confused on Wednesday.

 A student, who was allotted a seat in all India quota, said that on Wednesday afternoon he got a message that he was allotted a seat in surgery department of the MP Shah Government Medical College. His joy was short-lived as at about 7pm, he got another message stating that earlier allotment was cancelled as there was a technical glitch. The Medical Counselling Committee immediately pulled down the merit list.
 
 On Thursday, a new merit list was displayed and students got SMSes of fresh allotments. All India first ranker Ruchir Agarwal, a student from Rajkot, has got admission in the BJ Medical College in general medicine department. Shikha Shah, who was ranked eighth in the country and second in Gujarat, has also taken admission in the BJ Medical College in MD dermatology department. Amay Banker, who was ranked 30th in the country, has secured admission in master of surgery in Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College, Mumbai.
