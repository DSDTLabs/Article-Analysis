 I was blown away this weekend! I have raced all over the world and I have worked with P1 Global across many races and produced races as well in addition to racing, but this weekend has been remarkable.
 
 Usually, a first time producer has a lot of hiccups with a lot of permits needed and getting process and systems in place while persuading people to buy into your vision. And, it is maybe, only in your tenth year of producing that it really gets smooth.
 
 But this race weekend has been like a race in its tenth year! The people who have put it together have done a miraculous job.
 
 From a racer's perspective, I love that you have people representing the country and I love when people from other racing disciplines come to become powerboat racers. I do hope that CS and Gill continue to race with us. Also, I think Santosh answered it right today, saying that he knew he wanted to grow up and race motorcycles, and I hope young Indians look at Santosh and Gill, and are inspired to race our boats.
 
 I also believe that CS and Gill's participation this year will help us build a series of multiple races across India in the future where we have the best “Indian” racer, racing against all the other international racers.
