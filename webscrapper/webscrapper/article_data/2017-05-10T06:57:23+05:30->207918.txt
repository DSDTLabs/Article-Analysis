Mumbai: There will be an elephant in the room when ‘Gajab Kahani’ is staged at   from next week. ‘Gajab Kahani’ is the second of the seven plays being staged at this season’s  ,   Group’s theatre initiative in association with The Times of India. Set in 1551, ‘Gajab Kahani’ is based on the novel ‘The Elephant Journey’ by Portuguese Nobel laureate late José de Sousa Saramago. It trails the journey of an elephant and his mahout from India to Europe.

 “It is a play about an Indian elephant in a foreign land. We didn’t need to adapt it to Indian sensibilities since the main character—the elephant—is from India. It is a story with warmth, a great deal of humour and insights into the workings of human beings personifying the literal elephant in the room,” says  , the play’s director.
 
 While ‘Gajab Kahani’ is one of the two Hindi plays at this edition of Aadyam, characters in the act speak different languages and dialects that differentiate their backgrounds and make them accessible. The supporting cast will speak an invented new language—a mix of gibberish tempered with Spanish language, which adds greatly to the comedy. 
 
 Like the inaugural play, ‘Gajab Kahani’ too will be performed in the black box format over ten shows from May 20, creating an immersive experience. Divya Bhatia, Aadyam’s artistic director, says, “The charm of ‘Gajab Kahani’ is that it shifts you from being a spectator and places you firmly in the drama. In the black box, the story grows on you..”
