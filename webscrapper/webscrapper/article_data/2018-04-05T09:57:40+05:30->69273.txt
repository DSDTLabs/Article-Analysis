IDUKKI: While the central government has taken several steps to promote yoga in the country, the Syro-Malabar Church’s doctrinal commission report has said that it was not a medium to attain divine experience.

 The report was prepared by the Pala diocese bishop  . It was approved by the   synod recently. However, a group of priests and laity members have opposed the report. 
 
 “Yoga is not a way to reach the God. It is not right to believe that it will be helpful to experience God or to have a personal encounter with the almighty. Yoga doesn’t bring about any improvement in any person,” said the report.
 
 “The RSS and other   are trying to promote yoga all over India. So, the laity should be more vigilant about the practice. Yoga has an important place in our culture. It is to be considered as a physical exercise or simply as postures to concentrate or to meditate,” the report adds.
 
 “The laity and   should take care to avoid paying attention to yoga and other spiritual movements, which are totally against the Catholic faith. The yoga and other anti-Christian practices do not encourage the official teachings of the Church,” it said. In order to address various health problems, several Christians have been attending yoga sessions. But these practices promote anti-Christian views and culture. Any sensible person should not encourage such practices, said the   report.
