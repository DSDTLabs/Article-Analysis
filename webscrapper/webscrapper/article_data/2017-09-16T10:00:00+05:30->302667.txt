 I am 34-year-old woman and my parents want me to get married. But I am not very comfortable with the idea of getting married and I do not even want to have children. I have a very low libido and I have not come across whom I can trust and have great compatibility. But on the other hand, I fear growing old alone and having no one by my side. I am holding back because of all these reasons. Could you please advise me what should I do?
 

 
 Thank you for sharing your concern. You stated that your parents want you to get married but you are not very comfortable with the idea of marriage and you are also okay if you don't have children. But you are also fearful of being alone. I would suggest that you reflect and understand the pros and cons of getting married and not getting married, and then prepare yourself as both the situations would have their own challenges. 
  
 You have also stated that your libido is low and you did not find anyone you can trust and feel compatible with. If this is the reason of not getting married then you should give it little time and keep the search on, you might find someone who is compatible. 
  
 I understand that you are fearful and scared but we are unaware about the future. We only know our present and we can be prepared for our future situations. You can consider meeting a professional for coping skills.
