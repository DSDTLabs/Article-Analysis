AHMEDABAD: A   has filed a complaint against three persons for theft of Rs 1.44 lakh cash from inside a bank premises earlier this month. Khadia police have converted the application of complaint into an FIR on March 24.

 According to investigators, Jayantilal Joshi, 68, a resident of Naiwada, Raipur, had been to Central Bank of India’s branch at Raipur on March 8. He converted a fixed deposit of Rs 5.7 lakh into a deposit in a joint account with his wife   and later filled up three receipts for withdrawal of the amount. He withdrew the amount in cash and began counting it at 3.45pm.

 Afterwards, when Joshi counted the currency notes again, he found 72 notes of Rs 2,000 amount to Rs 1.44 lakh missing. When he checked with the bank officials about the unidentified persons, the bank officials said no such persons work with the bank. Police have sought description of the accused and are looking for CCTV footage of the spot and nearby areas.
