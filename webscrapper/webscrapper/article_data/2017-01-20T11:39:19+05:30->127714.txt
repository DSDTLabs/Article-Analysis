KOLHAPUR: The civic body has planned to carry out a detailed survey of hawkers in the city and chalk out a plan for   policy without hampering their business.

 The survey — expected to be completed in the next few months — will help the   (KMC) to ensure presence of the “only authorised” hawkers in the designated areas on the city roads.
 
 A decision to conduct the survey was taken at a recently held joint meeting of civic administration and hawkers’ associations.
 
 The hawkers’ representatives, present in significant numbers at the meeting, alleged that hawkers were being targeted for no reason by civic authorities and action was being initiated even against authorised hawkers.
 
 The KMC recently initiated action against hawkers in city’s central parts. The action led to unrest among hawkers who claimed that many hawkers have applied for cards but did not receive it from the administration.
 
 The hawkers’ association also urged the administration to stop action and resolve the issue through dialogues. They also pointed that the administration should act against encroachments along the roads instead of targeting hawkers for no reason.
 
 Civic authorities clarified that illegal hawkers will continue to face action. “It is mandatory for every hawker to complete the registration process and he/she should obtain a biometric card. Those who have applied for biometric cards and have a legal receipt issued by administration will not face action,” the authorities said.
 
 Meanwhile, the administration has said that a committee comprising 20 members will be set up to look after the implementation of hawkers’ policy. About 8 members in the committee will represent the hawkers while three members will be selected from the civic organisations.
 
 Mayor  , who was present at the meeting, said the administration should avoid unnecessary action against hawkers and it should prepare a comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of hawkers.
