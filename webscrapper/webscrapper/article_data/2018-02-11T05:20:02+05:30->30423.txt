MUMBAI: While a plea for his remission could be considered by the state, Abu  , sentenced to life imprisonment in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case has lost no time in apprising the   (ECHR) about how the Portuguese authorities ought to expedite the hearing to ensure his return to Lisbon as the punishment violates a commitment made by the Indian government. 

 He wrote to the court last month and listed out all the punishment and convictions that a special court handed out to him in the blasts case, saying that they were in excess of what was agreed and authorised under the extradition order. He had been extradited from   in 2005 to be tried in several cases, including a murder and the blasts.
 
 Last year, months before his conviction in the blasts case, Salem had petitioned ECHR for his return to Portugal. He alleged his presence and trial in India are illegal following the termination of his extradition order as upheld in 2014 by the Court of Appeal of Portugal.
