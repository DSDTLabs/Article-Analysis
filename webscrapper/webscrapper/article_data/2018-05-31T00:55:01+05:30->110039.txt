Kolkata: In order to “achieve rationalization and optimize operational performance”, world’s largest bulk   producer   (India) on Wednesday said it is going to dispose of some of its own tea estates as the board felt the production in the company’s own gardens is “disproportionately heavier” compared to the output from the leaves purchased from the small tea growers and the gardens of its step-down overseas subsidiaries.

 The bulk tea major plans to utilize the sale proceeds in repayment of certain high interest-bearing debts and buying back shares at a price not exceeding Rs 210 per share up to an aggregate outgo of Rs 100 crore. With the rest of money, McLeod Russel is also planning to make investment for diversification into   business for which it has already agreed to join hands with   Industries India via a third entity.
 
 According to sources, the company has planned to sell at least five tea estates and started talking to the interested buyers.
 
 In a statement, the company said: “The tea estates in Africa are performing well and contributing significantly to the company’s bottomline...”
 
 In the regulatory filing, McLeod Russel said the maximum number of shares to be bought back is 47,61,904 or 4.35% of the total equity shares of the company. “Further details of the buyback will be announced soon,” it said.
 
 The company which produces 67 million kgs of tea form its own estates said that it has set up a committee to identify certain tea estates that would be hived off.
 
 Meanwhile, the tea major has posted a 120% jump in standalone net profit for 2017-18 at Rs 67.26 crore against Rs 30.53 crore in the year-ago period. The standalone operating EBIDTA rose 6% to Rs 32.52 crore for the whole fiscal. The company’s sales for the financial year jumped 49 lakh kg to 901 lakh kg.
 
 The McLeod Russel scrip on Wednesday closed at Rs 154, 1.15 per cent higher on BSE.
