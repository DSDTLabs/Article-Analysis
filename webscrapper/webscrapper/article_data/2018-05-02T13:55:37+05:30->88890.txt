MARGAO: The village level committee ( ) of Loutolim, constituted during formulation of Regional Plan 2021, has pointed out that survey No. 163/1 of   village, now owned by MLA Nilesh   was proposed as an orchard zone in the draft plan, but was shown as an industrial zone in the notified plan.

 In a press note issued on Tuesday, VLC member Franky   demanded to know how town and country planning ( ) minister   intends to rectify the entire plan for Loutolim village in RP 2021. Cabral is among 14 politicians named by voluntary organisation Goencho Avaaz, of having benefitted by changing large tracts of land into settlement zones in various parts of Goa, as reflected in RP-2021.
 
 “Loutolim villagers need to know who proposed the changes. Also several private lands near the industrial estate have been shown as general industries without any such proposal made,” Monteiro said.
