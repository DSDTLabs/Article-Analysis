CHANDIGARH: Even as   on Sunday tried to placate discontent among those upset over their non-inclusion in the nine additions to the council of ministers, leaders like Amritsar (West) MLA Raj Kumar Verka still expect course correction by the party.

 Verka told TOI that a section of the Dalit community feels that injustice had been done as they had not been given due representation in the cabinet. He said that he had raised the issue with both state leadership and the high command. “It’s a not a personal issue about me but pertains to the feelings of a community that is nearly 35 lakh of Punjab’s population. Since Independence, a fine balance has always been maintained among various communities. We have raised this issue at the party forum and the leadership will redress it,” he maintained.
 
 Verka, a prominent Dalit face of the party, was expecting a cabinet berth but failed to make it to the final list finalised by chief minister Amarinder Singh after two meetings with   president Rahul Gandhi. Apart from Verka, Indian Youth Congress president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Kuljit Singh Nagra too were expecting cabinet berths as young leaders of the party.
 
 Meanwhile, an attempt was made to pacify them at a meeting with Punjab Congress president  , party incharge of Punjab affairs Asha Kumari and co-incharge   in Chandigarh. Jakhar said that the party had many able leaders who might have been aspiring for a place in the cabinet and the issues would be resolved. “They are pillars of the party and have been contributing for the welfare of the state. Whatever issues they have will be take care of in due course,” he said.
 
 At least three party MLAs claimed to have resigned in protest after the list of new ministers was announced on Friday. Asha Kumari, however, said that no resignation had been received by the party. Sources said some of the disgruntled leaders had expressed grouse after the swearing-in ceremony on Sunday.
