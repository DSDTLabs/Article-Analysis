BENGALURU: The Indian Navy’s recent RFI for 57 naval fighter aircraft kickstarted the race for another major defence deal. For the Navy, unhappy with the performance of the naval version of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Boeing’s F-18s Super Hornet and Dassualt’s Gripen are forerunners for the spot. 

 However, US President’s Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policy has raised speculation about the American companies’ ability to adhere to Modi’s Make in India policies, especially shifting manufacturing to India. 
 
 Thom Breckenridge, vice-president, global sales - India, Boeing, however, said it was early for any speculation of policy changes. Although he didn't comment on the possible impact of the Boeing’s abilities to deliver as per Indian requirements, he said Boeing would work with the Indian government in a manner similar to their cooperation with the US government. 
 
 The latest variant of the aircraft was introduced in 2007 and the US Navy expects it to be operational till the 2040s. The Super Hornet is the largest operating naval fighter aircraft and has over 700 deliveries of Super Hornet across the world. “Cost per hour becomes an important issue for any Navy. US government public accountability office data shows the Super Hornet has the lowest cost per flight hour,” he said. 
 
 Boeing has 35 direct suppliers and 120 indirect suppliers of various components of Super Hornets. “With our scale and presence in India, we will be able to provide a compelling Make in India offer,” he said, despite speculation on the Trump regime’s policies.
 
 While Boeing is harping on their reliability, their competition Saab Gripen is promising a 6th-7th generation fighter planes. At the same time, many are still batting for the LCA naval version; recently, VK Saraswat, member of Niti Aayog and former DRDO chief, said the LCA Navy is as good as any aircraft and the Indian Navy should support the project.
