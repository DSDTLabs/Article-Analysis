On his visit to the city, former cricketer   visited 
  office yesterday. And in a relaxed conversation over coffee, he spoke about his debut as a singer and some assal Nagpuri delicacies before he made a startling statement regarding the Bharat Ratna…
A frequent visitor to Nagpur, Kambli now considers the city as his second home. He shared, “I have many friends in Nagpur, including Subroto Banerjee and Prashant Vaidya. So, the city is like a second home for me. The best part is I can’t leave Nagpur without buying santra barfi and Saoji mutton for my wife, Andrea. She is addicted to these goodies.”
 The cricketer who is making a debut as a singer, is candid enough to admit that it is a tough job, although he goes on to add, “I was the entertainer of the Indian cricket team at one time. And dancing is a passion for me. But when I said yes to recording a solo song Asa Mee, Mee Asa to lyricist Rahul Seth, I had to work for more than eight hours a day to get my notes and steps right. Song and dance routine is more difficult than scoring runs. But if my song clicks, my dream is to sing for Salman Khan.”

 Kambli admits that his hobby of being an entertainer does give a lot of pleasure to him but his heart is dedicated to the game of cricket. Baring his plans he said, “Now I want to give something back to the game of cricket taught to me by Achrekar guruji.   and I made a debut in this game because of guruji’s coaching and even registered our names together in the Guinness Book with our 664 runs partnership. I feel Achrekar guruji should have got the   before Sachin Tendulkar. He has given nine cricketers to the country.”
