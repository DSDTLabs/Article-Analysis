CHENDIGARH: Haryanaâ€™s department of archaeology and museums and the   will sign an memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore early Harappan culture at  , one of the earliest Harappan sites in the state.

 The MoU will be signed on February 28.
 
 An official of the state archaeology and museums department said the excavation at this site was first conducted by late J S   and M Acharya under   state archaeology department in 1985-86. The previous excavations have provided significant traits of early Harappan culture in our subcontinent for the very first time in the history of Harappan studies. He said that the new project has been initiated to bring out the earliest material culture of the site, where the core area of the settlement is three-four acres but the site expands to nine acres.
 
 Kunal has a great contribution in the early Harappan studies in Indian sub-continent and will definitely open new prospects in future researches on formation and antecedent stages of classical Harappans. The developed drainage system characterizes this site. This excavation is aimed at bringing out the earliest material culture of the site and may push the history of the civilization back by over a thousand years.
 
 Kunal is located on the bank of now dried up river course of Saraswati. This early Harappan time (3500-2500 BC) that is Period-I is divided by Period-IA (3500-2850 BC), Period-IB (2850-2600 BC) and Period-IC (2600-2500 BC) which is followed by Mature Harappan Period 11 (2500-1900 BC). Hence the Kunal excavations will provide us with a large number of new insights of early Harappan culture, he added.
