KOLKATA: When former footballer   was told that he had colon cancer, the world seemed to be crumbling around him. A chill went down his spine and his feet felt unsteady. But then Banerjee, who loves to call himself a fighter, raced his mind back to the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan IFA Shield final clash of 1964. Leading the red-and-gold brigade from the front against a formidable Bagan line-up that had the legendary Chuni Goswami in its ranks, Banerjee’s side managed to finish the game with honours even. If he could defy his opponents on the football ground, why couldn’t he confront cancer, he asked himself.

 “I never felt shaky after those first few moments. Over the last seven years, I have gone through five cycles of   and now am cured. I feel fine and lead a normal life just as I would before the disease had struck,” said the 82-year-old who hates to call himself a cancer survivor. “You don’t refer to a malaria patient as a survivor but it’s a killer ailment, too. Why single out cancer?” he asks.
 
 Around a dozen like Banerjee, who have refused to be cowed down by the terminal ailment and have come up trumps, gathered at the   on the occasion of   on Saturday. They shared their stories, egged each other on and urged everyone not to treat them differently. For many of them, life didn’t end with cancer, but, in fact, took a turn for the better.
 
 Take, for instance, former export consultant Om Chaddha who discovered marital bliss after being diagnosed with cancer in 1999. “Like any other patient, I, too, was devastated. But then, I chose to be rational and told myself that since I had been diagnosed early, I won’t die. After 30 cycles of chemotherapy, the cancerous cells were gone. It took a toll on my system, but my spirit didn’t flag. I started focusing on the positives and actually got married at 58. I wonder if I would be as happy now had the disease not struck,” said Chaddha.
