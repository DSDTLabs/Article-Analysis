HOSUR: Two and three-wheeler manufacturer TVS Motor Company has said it will increase prices of its vehicles by 1.5% to 2% in a graded manner as cost of manufacturing has risen due to changes in emission norms. Indian government has announced the migration from Bharat Stage (BS) III to BS IV effective April 1, 2017 in order to curtain vehicular pollution. TVS has started production of BS-IV standard vehicles from February. “The price impact because of this will be 1.5% to 2%. We will try and absorb as much as possible, but we may have to pass on part of the increase to the consumer,” said CEO of the company, K N Radhakrishnan. Terming the market conditions wobbly, as it is yet to fully recover from demonetisation shock, Radhakrishnan said that TVS Motor, would miss its self-imposed market share target of 15% for the current fiscal and achieve 14.3%. “We hope to exit at 14.2-14.3% market share in the current financial year. The objective is 18% over the next two years,” he said.  He said that plans are to launch a new motorcycle and scooter in the next fiscal in addition to various product upgrades.  TVS has earmarked a capex of Rs 350 crore for the next fiscal which will be met from internal accruals.
