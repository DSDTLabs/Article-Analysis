Porvorim: Revenue minister Rohan Khaunte told the Goa legislative Assembly on Thursday that Goa, Daman and Diu Land Revenue (record of rights and register of cultivators) Rules, 1969, would be   to clear mutation cases in 90 days. 

 Khaunte was responding to a question tabled by Nuvem MLA Wilfred D’Sa.
 
 The Congress MLA had asked how long would it take to clear 336 partition cases concerning his constituency, which have been pending since 2012.
 
 The revenue minister said that the task of simplification of these procedures has already begun. After the act was amended, as many as 7,000 cases of mutation were cleared in 90 days. “Similarly, the government will amend the land revenue code to clear partition cases within 90 days”.
 
 To a query raised by D’Sa, as well some other opposition members, Khaunte clarified that under the law, partition of land of less than 200 sq m is not permitted.
 
  The MLAs urged the revenue minister to consider this matter on a case-to-case basis.
