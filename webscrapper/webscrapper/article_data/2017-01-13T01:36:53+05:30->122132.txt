GURGAON: Ignoring strong rumours that the state government is dragging its feet over the draft Bill on   ( ), the state   on Thursday said the   route might be adopted to speed up the process. As reported by TOI on Tuesday, there has been no forward movement on the revised draft Bill, a month after it was submitted to the state government.

 Minister Rao Narbir Singh said the formalities should take another 10 days or so. “Things are on the right track and the formalities should take about another 10 days. Since the next assembly session is due only in March, we are likely to bring an ordinance and introduce the Bill in the assembly later on. With our full majority in the House, there won’t be any problem in getting the Bill passed,” said Narbir.
 
 “We are trying to expedite the process. The idea of setting up GMDA is to reduce Chandigarh’s control over Gurgaon, so that decisions can be taken here itself. I’m sure all approvals that are needed will be granted soon, and GMDA will start functioning at the earliest possible,” he said.
 
 However, due to the considerable delay in getting the draft approved, officials in Gurgaon are finding it hard to manage affairs, without a full-fledged budget, office space or manpower. Around 250 experts from various fields will be working in GMDA, for whom adequate space is required. Authorities said they can start hiring people only if they have enough office space available. At present, GMDA is operating from a small residential building in Civil Lines near  , which has been converted into an office.
