GURUGRAM: To conduct   of   carried out in the   in the last 26 years, the forest department has formed a three-member panel, sources told TOI. The state government has spent nearly Rs 500 crore in last six years to increase the green cover in the Aravalis. 

 The panel — comprising of chief conservator and two district forest officers — will review the plantation drives in areas including Gurgaon, Faridabad, Mahendergarh, Rewari and Bhiwadi.
 
 In December last year, additional chief secretary (Forest), RR Jowel, highlighted the need to conduct the audit of the Aravali Project. “The objective (of the project) was to make Aravali hills greener. Several plantation drives have been carried out in the last 26 years. The   (EU) also allocated a huge grant (Rs 175 crore) in the 1990s for the project. However, the green cover has not increased significantly. There is a need to determine how much work has been actually carried out,” he said.
 
 Despite hefty budgets allocated for plantation drives, the forest and tree cover in Haryana has increased by only 0.16 per cent of the total geographical area of the state between 2006 and 2011, as per 2012 CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) report. Currently, the forest cover in the state is less than 4 per cent of its total geographical area. 
 
 Meanwhile, experts gave mixed reactions about the formation of the panel to conduct audit. “I appreciate the move to conduct such an audit. With tree cover constantly depleting in Haryana, an assessment of what has been done so far is extremely important,” said Sanjay Kaushik, a city-based activist who runs NGO Uthaan. Some environmentalists, however, opined that the audit will only divert the attention from real issues.
