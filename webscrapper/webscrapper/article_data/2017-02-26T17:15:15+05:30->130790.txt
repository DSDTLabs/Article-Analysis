Actor   has always been vocal about his support for Jallikattu. After lauding the youth uprising to lift the ban on the sport in Chennai, the actor further bolstered his support on Tuesday. While taking a dig at the Tamil Nadu government for the way they handled the protest and the subsequent violence, he said that people would take to protest when things are forced on them. He even drew parallels to caparisoned elephants being allowed in Kerala. 'Several people have died and wide spread destruction are reported when elephants in musth attack people and property. But elephants are still part of the temple festivals in Kerala. They use elephants for festivals and make them stand in the scorching heat for several hours. They perform chenda melam and have fireworks in front of the elephants and the animals have been used to such things. So, why not allow   in Tamil Nadu?' he asked. 

 'More people die in road accidents than in Jallikattu. But no one bans vehicles. Same is the case with car races. Everyone knows they are dangerous and yet people participate and champions are honoured.'
 
 On ensuring the safety of the animals that used for jallikattu, Kamal said, 'The bulls that participate in Jallikattu are taken care of in the best manner by the people. They are looked after and fed well. Instead of banning Jallikattu, the government should make amends in the law and impose restrictions on how Jallikattu is conducted, so that there are no cruelties and death.'
