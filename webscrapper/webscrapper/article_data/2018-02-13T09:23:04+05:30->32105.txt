THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: On Monday, chief minister   reminded his cabinet colleagues to be present in the state capital at least for five days in a week. It was one suggestion made by Vijayan as soon as LDF assumed power.

 The reminder comes in the wake of absence of several ministers in the last cabinet meet scheduled on Friday. The meet was called off as only six of the 19-member cabinet showed up, falling short of quorum.
 
  
  
 
 According to sources, the CM put forth it as a suggestion rather than a strict order. The absent ministers had the prior permission of the CM to skip the meet.
 
 Meanwhile, a special cabinet meeting was convened to renew the ordinances which was about to expire. Around a dozen ordinances, including amendments to   and Paddy Land Wetland Conservation Acts were approved by the cabinet.
 
 However, the reports that the ministers were not happy with the instruction of the chief minister to be present for five days in the state capital has been termed baseless by   V S  .
 
 Agriculture minister  , meanwhile, rubbished the reports that the minister were not happy about the CM’s suggestion. “The instruction was given when the government came to power. The ministers had been following this and there were no criticism against it,” he said defending the ministers who gave Friday’s meet a miss. Only during certain occasions or unavoidable government functions that the minister go out of the state capital during week days. The ministers spend more time in their offices, he added.
