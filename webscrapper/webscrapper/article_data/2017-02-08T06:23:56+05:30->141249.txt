CHENNAI: "Oooh! Does baby want a cracker?" the visitor says. "Grrrrr!" the  's mother replies in no uncertain warning. 

 That exchange may never occur, given that its mother's milk will do just fine for now, before its more bloodthirsty proclivities take over, but the cub, that lioness Jhansi gave birth to on Monday, promises to soon be the star attraction at Vandalur's Arignar Anna  .
 
 But visitors would do well to keep a safe distance. Even   are currently too wary to approach mother or child because Jhansi is likely to be very possessive about her offspring and could get aggressive, an official said.
 
 With the cub, the zoo now has 15 lions. Zookeepers still have not established the sex of the cub that is yet to open its eyes, an official said. Lion cubs usually don't open their eyes until a week or so after birth. 
 
 They start to crawl a day or two after birth and walk when they are around three weeks old. Lions are all born blind, in litters of up to four - though Jhanvi's cub has no siblings to squabble with. The cub, as is common, was around 1 foot long and weighed close to a pound at birth.
 
 Jhansi was a motherless cub of sorts after she was born in 2011, with mother Kavitha rejecting her and zoo staff members subsequently separating them to prevent the lioness from killing her newborn.
 
 Former veterinarian Thirumurugan hand-reared Jhansi in his quarters at the zoo. A year later, Kavitha had three more cubs, which former chief minister J Jayalalithaa named Maya, Kala and Neela. Lion Raghav sired the three lionesses.
