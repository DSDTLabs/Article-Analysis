BENGALURU: With 96 assembly constituencies, North Karnataka region is vital for any party to come to power in the state. 

 Realising that his party is on a weak wicket in North Karnataka, former chief minister and JD(S) state president   had decided to focus on the region by renting a house at Hubballi three months ahead of polls. But things didn't go as planned because he suffered from health issues. 
 
 However, the discontent in the   and   ranks over allotment of tickets has helped Kumaraswamy gain a foothold in North Karnataka.
 
 The regional party is now hoping for a repeat of 2004 polls when it had won 58 seats - the highest since its inception. 
 
 As many as 15 of the 18 leaders who had defected from the Congress and BJP to the JD(S) prior to elections had secured tickets for themselves or for their kin. This helped the JD(S) form the government first with the Congress, followed by the BJP.
 
 Cut to 2018, about 17 prominent leaders have left the BJP and Congress to join the JD(S). The party offered them tickets on a platter, much to the chagrin of party members. 
 
 However, political observers consider this development favourable for the JD(S), especially in North Karnataka and Bengaluru where the party doesn't have a firm footing.
 
  They are of the view that giving tickets to the rebels might help them boost their tally significantly.
