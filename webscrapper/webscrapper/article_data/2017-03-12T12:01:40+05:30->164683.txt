PANAJI: Goa Forward Party ( ) with its election message, Goem, Goenkar and Goenkarponn, and the ‘Goa Song’ to back it seems to have struck a chord with the electorate, as three of its four candidates are set to enter the 40-member house.

 With Fatorda MLA and GFP mentor Vijai Sardesai spearheading operations, the party emerged as the most successful political outfit, achieving 75% success in terms of seats contested and won. While Sardesai, former Congress members Jayesh Salgaonkar in Saligao and Vinod Palyekar emerged victorious, only Velim nominee Anthony Rodrigues was defeated. 
 
 Barring the Nationalist Congress Party, which boasted of a lone success, other smaller outfits could not make much of a dent in the polls.
 
 NCP nominee Churchill Alemao’s win is considered more of a personal victory than that of the NCP, which had drawn a blank in the 2012 polls.
 
 Goa Su-Raj Party (GSRP) with former tourism minister Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco as its main candidate and two others; and United Goans Party with St Cruz MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate and Ramakant Borkar in Cortalim drew a blank.
 
 Goa Vikas Party failed to cut ice with voters. Bhaujan Mukta Party with three; Communist Party of India and Goa Praja Party, with two each, Samajwadi Janata Party and Niz Goenkar Revolutionary Front, among others, were small groups which could not catch the voters’ attention.
