On Thursday, over 100 students and teachers from various departments of   came together to pay tribute to actress   who passed away earlier this week. The college’s film society made a 30-minute long video, which was a compilation of some of her best scenes and dance clips from movies like ‘Chaalbaaz’, ‘Sadma’, ‘Mr. India’ and ‘Chandni’. Before the screening, the audience observed a two-minute silence in her remembrance. 

 
  
 Many movie enthusiasts claimed that the actress is a source of inspiration for them and laughed and sobbed all along during the event. “How charming was she! It is rather unfortunate that we won’t be able to see more of her on screen. She will stay with us through the numerous movies she has done,” said a student present at the event. 
 
 The college’s Principal, Dr   said, “She was an immensely versatile actor and in our own way, we tried paying homage to the legendary actress.”
