NEW DELHI. The BJP’s   yesterday couldn’t help but praise outgoing   chief minister and CPM stalwart  , who’s being widely hailed for his simple lifestyle and upstanding public conduct, ever since it came to light recently that he’s the country’s poorest CM.

 Setting aside ideological differences, Madhav went to personally invite Sarkar for the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, the BJP’s CM elect  . He also heaped praise on Sarkar on Twitter, for moving out of the official CM residence promptly and without fuss.
 
  “True to his character, he has shifted to the party office immediately after resigning as CM post the election. This is something that other leaders could emulate,” Madhav tweeted after he and Deb went to the CPM office to invite Sarkar.
 
 Interestingly, Madhav did not hold the same opinion about Sarkar as recently as until a month ago.
 
 In the run-up to the Tripura Assembly elections, Madhav often targeted 69-year Sarkar to score political points. He accused him of running a “corrupt” and “violent” government in Tripura and urged the state’s voters to render Sarkar unemployed.
 
 “Sarkar has given you poverty and unemployment. After this election, make sure only one man stays unemployed. Take away his job and vote for BJP,” Madhav had said.
 
 Still, Sarkar yesterday graciously accepted the BJP’s invitation, even though other Left leaders decided to boycott the swearing in ceremony in protest against post-poll “vandalism” in the state, most notably the razing of a   statue on Monday.
 
 CPM leaders have taken view of the fact that Madhav not only condoned the statue’s demolition but also tweeted his approval of this act of hooliganism.
