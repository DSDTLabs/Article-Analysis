CHENNAI: Differences had cropped up in the   unit of the   over the crucial floor test scheduled for Saturday that would decide the fate of the   government. Sections within the feud-ridden   have accused its president S Thirunavukkarasar, with his AIADMK past, of softening towards the V K Sasikala-led faction and possibly taking a decision to direct his party MLAs to abstain from voting during the floor test on Saturday .

 But, during his meeting with the party's eight MLAs on Friday evening, Thirunavukkarasar elicited their views and said the party high command would decide the party's stand.“We will meet again at 9am tomorrow for a final decision,“ Thirunavukkarasar told reporters. Many , including Congress legislature party leader K R Ramasamy , a P Chidambaram loyalist, appeared not to be inclined to do anything that may upset its ally DMK. It is in the interest of DMK that the two AIADMK factions fail to win confidence so an interim election may benefit it (DMK).
 
 Thirunavukkarasar declined to react to rumours that he was for abstaining from voting during the floor test. “We are in touch with our ally DMK working president M K Stalin,“ CLP leader K R Ramasamy said before the meeting of legislators. Former TNCC president   said AICC vice-president   was keen to toe DMK's stand on the matter. Late evening on Friday , Rahul Gandhi issued a directive to his party MLAs to vote against the Palaniswami government.
 
 Ally DMK, with a strong 89-member presence in the Tamil Nadu House, had awaited with nervous anticipation its ally's decision. T K S Elangovan said, “We hope Congress would take a good decision.The CLP leader and members are clear they will vote against the government.“
 
 The DMK and allies Congress and IUML (one member) have 98 members in all. Ailing DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi will not be present.
