From a urban collegian to a Haryanvi village guy, there's a major transformation one spots in Param's looks as well as role play. Excerpts from a chat with this telly hottie:
 
  
 
  
  While doing Sadda Haq, I used to keep mentioning in my interviews that I will not take up daily soaps on GECs. But Ghulaam was such an interesting con cept that I couldn't help taking this up. It is an amazing experience to work on this one as I am working on a new dialect, a totally different body language and look. It is regressive in some ways and many people thought that my role will be similar to that of Shah Rukh Khan's character in Koyla -but this is not true. Although, after taking up this daily soap it is appropriate to `never say never'. I keep saying no to reality shows as well but, now I think I shouldn't because who knows, tomorrow I may end up participating in one.
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  Travelling every few months has to be on my cards otherwise the monotony of routine gets to me. When I was in London for my studies, I used to go backpacking every now and then. Even trekking in the Himalayas is on my wish-list. Everytime I travel, I observe people around me and I think it helps me to be a better actor.
  
  
 
  
  Harshita (Gaur) and I bonded pretty well since our show Sadda Haq started. We have a special connection. But, whether it is love or not Â­ that is tough to tell. People keep on asking us but I feel it is too early to talk about it and both of us don't know what the future has in store for us. We are too young and have just started with our careers. Nothing except work will be in focus for the next 10 years, I guess. And if at all there is something more to our bond, I will definitely share or announce it to everyone on social networking site.
