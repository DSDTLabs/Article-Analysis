NAGPUR: With the announcement of three major   in the region, the coming days are going to be all about bird conservation.

 To engage people in documenting bird species, the Great Backyard Bird Count will be held on February 17. The count is organized globally by Cornell University and Audubon Society, US. “Surveys are usually done for water birds or rare species. But through this count, we will try to cover maximum species, no matter how common they are,” said Jayant Wadatkar, Vidarbha coordinator of the count.
 
 To involve students, the count will be organized at many college campuses too. Last year, over 80 bird species were reported at 11 spots in Vidarbha.
 
 To monitor the status of water birds and wetlands, the   (BNHS) is holding   with Wetlands International from January 17-22. The first phase of this was conducted in the region on January 15 in which over 10 water bodies were covered.
 
 Ornithologist Dr Anil Pimplapure, who is the state coordinator of the project, informed that the next phase of the Census will be held on January 22.said. Though last year’s census suggested an increase in the count of migratory birds in the region, the numbers seem low this time.
 
 According to observations made by volunteers, the water level was found low at many places including water bodies on Umred Road.
 
 The next round of the census will be on January 22.
 
 On the same day, a workshop is being organized for amateur birdwatchers ahead of the common bird monitoring programme. “Like house sparrows, there are many species of common urban birds which are facing a decline. It is important to collect data in a scientific manner,” said Dr  , founder of Wild-CER which is conducting the workshop in association with BNHS. The common bird monitoring programme will be held probably by first week of February.
