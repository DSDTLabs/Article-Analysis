Noida: A six-year-old boy was   by two men when he went to graze cattle in a nearby field in   in   on Saturday. The villagers, however, held a meeting and hushed up the matter after levying a 'fine' of Rs 1 lakh on each accused. The villagers decided that the accused would pay the money to victim's family and that the latter shall not report the matter to police. 

 "Two local youths aged 20 and 22 years lured the boy to a nearby wheat field and sodomised him. After the crime, the accused fled from the spot, leaving the victim in pain," said a villager.
 
 The boy's father, a labourer, started looking for him when he did not return home. The villagers soon found him in the field and crying in pain. The boy told his family members that two local youths had assaulted him.
 
  The villagers identified the two accused and held a panchayat. "The accused were also given a mild thrashing. The elderly men pronounced a 'judgment' that each accused pay Rs 1 lakh to the victim's family. In turn, the victim's family agreed not to report the matter to police. The matter was resolved," said a villager. The boy was sent to a local hospital and later discharged. 
 
 Dilip Singh, circle officer, Jewar, said the police have no information on the matter.
