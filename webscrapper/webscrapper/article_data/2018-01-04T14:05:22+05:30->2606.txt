GURGAON: A city court on Wednesday extended the judicial custody of the Class 11 student of  ,  , who is accused of murdering seven-year-old Pradhyumn   of the same school.

 The court of additional sessions judge sent the teenager back to the Faridabad-based observation home for another 14 days, accepting the request of the CBI that opposed the student’s bail plea, saying the investigation was still at a crucial stage.
 
 The court will hear arguments on the bail plea, filed in mid-December, on Saturday.
 
 “Hearing on the bail plea has been scheduled for January 6,” said Sanjdeep Aneja, counsel for the juvenile. Earlier, on December 22, the court had extended the juvenile’s judicial custody till January 3, when he was produced before it for the first time following the   Justice Board’s directive to try the teenager as an adult in connection with Pradhyumn’s murder. A brief hearing was held on the bail plea, when the CBI had opposed the plea as it had not recorded statements of some witnesses. It argued that the juvenile, if granted bail, could temper with evidence, influence and intimidate the witnesses.
 
 The counsel said the bailplea was submitted under the rule 10(5) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016. “As per the rules, the investigating agency should have completed the probe within one month of detention or arrest of the child, and submit the chargesheet. As the CBI has failed to complete it within the given time, the child should be given benefit of default bail,” he argued.
 
 But, the CBI claimed that they were not bound to file chargesheet within 30 days of the arrest.
 
 Aneja had filed two more applications — one to oppose the JJ Board’s order, allowing CBI to take fingerprint of the juvenile, and the second to challenge the legality of the child’s CBI custody between November 8 and 11.
