NEW DELHI: Delhi   students may no longer enjoy 50% reservation in the varsity’s post-graduate seats from the coming academic year. DU’s academic committee on Thursday decided to hold entrance exams for all   admissions, reports  . 

 The decision will now be sent to the VC for approval. Till now, 50% of PG seats were set aside for DU’s undergraduate students who were admitted on merit. Entrance tests were held for the rest of the seats, for which   students could also appear. 
 
 “Now the committee is planning to create a centralised platform for holding entrance exams for all 45 PG courses,” an official said.
