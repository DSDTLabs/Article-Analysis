BENGALURU: There was a silver lining to the hike in electricity charges with apartment dwellers set to benefit. The   (KERC) rolled out a   with   (STPs) by pairing  .

 Until now, all   operators paid flat commercial rates, but from April 1 (retrospective effect), apartments operating STPs will pay at domestic rates which are considerably lower.
 
 
 M K Shankarlinge Gowda, KERC chairperson, said the decision was based on several pleas made by apartment complexes and resident welfare association (RWAs). “If the STP is located in a residential apartment complex, the same LT charges (domestic rates) will apply,” he said.
 
 “If it is in a commercial complex, then it would attract commercial rates and in industries it would be industrial tariffs. This would encourage all apartments to set up STPs on their premises,” he added.
 
 The KERC, considering environmental and social benefits, said solid waste processing units across the city will be allowed to pay LT and HT industrial category tariff. “There have been demands to bring them under commercial tariffs as they sell compost. However, considering the environmental and social benefits we have kept them under industrial category,” Gowda said.
 
 The commission has also marginally increased charges by 15 paise per unit for water pumping and supply units both in urban and rural areas. It has also decided to continue the rebate being provided for solar water heaters.
 
 No charges for card payment
 
 The KERC revealed it has turned down Bescom’s application to pass on processing charges incurred when consumers make payments through credit and debit cards or netbanking. The commission, instead, has directed Bescom to bear the processing charge of consumers’ bills up to Rs 2,000. The power utility clarified that it has already put in place ‘Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS)’ since March 2018 and consumers will be reimbursed process charges.
