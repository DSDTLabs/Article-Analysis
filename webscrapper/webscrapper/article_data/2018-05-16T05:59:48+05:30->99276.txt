MUMBAI: The state environment department on Tuesday hiked fees for processing applications for  . 

 
  All applications are dealt with by the state experts' appraisal committee ( ) and state environment impact assessment authority ( ); both have a separate chairman and members. So far, the chairman was given Rs 15,000 for presiding over a meeting, while a member was given Rs 10,000. Now, it is Rs 20,000 for the chairman and Rs 15,000 for a member.
 
  In a two-page order, additional chief secretary (environment)   stated that due to massive cost-escalation as well as cost of establishment for management of the committees, there was no option. "Once applications are received for securing environment clearance, it is the responsibility of the environment department to put up all such applications on the website, organise meetings of SEAC and SEIAA, draft minutes of the meeting and circulate orders issued by the government. In addition, we are recruiting persons from outside for basic work. In view of additional cost incurred, it was decided to hike processing fees,'' Gavai stated.
 
  An environment department official said that on March 13, 2000, the Centre had informed the state about the levy of processing fees, while neighbouring Gujarat and TN are charging for granting permission for projects in coastal regulation zones and for environmental impact assessment.
