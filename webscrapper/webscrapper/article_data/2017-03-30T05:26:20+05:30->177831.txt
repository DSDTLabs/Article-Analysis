NASHIK: The residents of Panchavati area will no more have to travel to Nashik city to catch a bus for Pune, as the MSRTC has decided to launch a service from   to   (Pune) from April 15. 

 The state transport body's move will also help commuters travelling to Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli district as buses for these areas leave from Swargate. Buses from Nashik currently halt at Pune's Shivajinagar stand, which is far from Swargate.
 
 "We have decided to start buses from Nimani bus stand in Panchavati to Swargate to facilitate connectivity for Nashikites. These buses will ply every hour between the two cities," RD Jagtap, district transport officer, MSRTC, Nashik division, said.
 
 "To begin with, the MSRTC will ply ordinary buses on this route and plans to introduce semi-luxury buses later, depending upon the response to the new service," he said.
 
 Nashik city is growing on Panchavati side and commuters from the area find it difficult or time consuming to come to the Mela Stand or   stand for a bus to Pune. 
 
 At the same time, when they return to Nashik, they have to take additional mode of transport to reach home.
 
 Meanwhile, the MSRTC has also decided to start a service from Satpur to Dhule, Satana and Malegaon.
