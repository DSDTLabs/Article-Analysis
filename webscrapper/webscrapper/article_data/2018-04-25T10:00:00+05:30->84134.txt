Bengalis love to idolise a character who goes on to become their hero, their alter ego and eventually, their guiding father figure. With   and Yeti Obhijaan, they found Kakababu; with the   series, they found   aka Feluda; with the Byomkesh series, they found Satyaneshi Byomkesh Bakshi; with Chander Pahar and Amazon Obhijaan, they found Shankar. This time around, Dhrubo Banerjee’s   gives birth to a new character that is neither a detective nor a globetrotter. He’s a dashing, suave Oxford-return professor —   (Abir Chatterjee) — who takes us back in time to rediscover Bengal’s history. 
“There will be a new idol for history and cine lovers and a new dada for Bengalis,” said the director, adding, “Like Feluda, Sonada is the quintessential Bengali guy. He’s someone we can depend on. Sonada is not shown as a goyenda here, he’s a history professor at Oxford, who comes back to his roots and makes every Bengali feel proud about their Bangaliana. He will unearth a hidden treasure related to Bengal’s cultural heritage. It will be a privilege if the audience finds Feluda in Sonada.” 
 However, Abir feels that there are certain differences between Feluda and Sonada. He said, “Sonada is not a goyenda. He has a nose for adventure and after solving a lot of riddles, he finally gets the sandhan of a hidden treasure. Feluda is an iconic character. We should not compare the two. Feluda has always solved crimes and gone out of his way to find the motive behind a particular incident, but Sonada is intrigued to find a hidden treasure, there’s no crime involved. Sonada is a mix of an intellectual, learned and down-to-earth Bengali man.’Commenting on the film, Arindam Sil said, “Sonada is today’s icon. He is youthful, follows the current fashion trend and is open about everything. Feluda has his own charm in jeans and kurta but Sonada can well become an idol for today’s youth.”
