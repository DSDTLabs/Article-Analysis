JAIPUR: Fire broke out at a transformer close to hotel   in   locality in the city on blistering Saturday afternoon which also affected a parked car. Panic prevailed among the people who were passing through the fire engulfed area. The onlookers, rather than intimating the police and fire office, were seen capturing videos and pictures on their cell phones. However, a team of fire tenders reached and doused the fire. 

 Panic prevailed when people witnessed flames from a transformer. Some people screamed to enquire about a car that was parked near the transformer. The car's owner had gone somewhere and given the keys to someone who did not know how to drive. A person volunteered and while he was about to reverse the vehicle, people cautioned him that the flames were reaching the fuel tank which can lead to a blast.
 
 Some locals intimated the fire office. A team of fire officers rushed to the spot and started dousing the fire. "No loss of life or injury was reported as traffic from both the sides was stopped. A car was damaged in the fire," said an officer with the fire office.
 
  It took almost half-an-hour to douse the fire.
