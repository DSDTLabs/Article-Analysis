COIMBATORE: A day after Salem commissioner Sanjay Kumar ordered the detention of M  , a post graduate journalism student, under the  , human rights advocates such as  , Venmani, Shekar Annadurai, Raja and Louis met her at the Coimbatore central prison to collect the detention order.

 The activists said they grounds of detention were baseless and the detention was illegal.
 
 Bala Murugan told TOI that the police had mentioned six cases against Valarmathi, but all the charges that were pressed were bailable offences. “They have mentioned that since her charges are bailable, they wanted to detain her under Goondas Act. All the cases that were registered were only for protests such as the jallikattu protest at Neduvasal, the hydro-carbon protest in Salem and for distributing pamphlets,” Balamurgan said. 
 
 In the order, police alleged the pamphlets contained slogans harmful to the interest of the nation, but the pamphlets actually contained information about a nature protection group and support to the farmers. “The charges are baseless. We plan to file a   petition in the Madras high court and will approach the advisory committee before that. Generally the Goondas Act is invoked for serious offences such as bootlegging, trafficking, sand smuggling, land grabbing and other criminal offences. The act cannot be invoked just because someone voiced their dissent against the politicians or the government policy,” Bala Murugan said.
 
 The lawyers said the police department and the government were making this a trend in recent times. “Anyone who voices dissent is arrested.   is the highest in Tamil Nadu. This is not acceptable. Moreover, she is just a student,” he said.
