One would expect villages around the ‘lifeline’ of the state to have abundant water, but that doesn’t seem to be the case when it comes to villages to the north of the   main canal near Bodeli. These villages are not a part of the command area of the Narmada project, despite some falling within its stone’s throw.

 The villages are in the command area of Sukhi dam and water is scarce. Such is the desperation that many draw water from the canal though it is forbidden to use diesel pumps.  , who is among those displaced by the   project, was resettled at Morakhla. "We were promised land that would have irrigation sources," he said. "Our farms are in the command area of Sukhi dam project and not the Narmada project. There is hardly any water available from the Sukhi dam." Many in the village use diesel pumps to draw water from the main canal located around a kilometre from where they stay. Pipelines have been laid from locations near the canal to distant farms.
 
 One of Solanki’s relatives, Mangilal Kheda, rues the fact that they were among the first who agreed to let go of their villages in Madhya Pradesh and settle in Gujarat. "At that time there was resistance to resettlement, but we set an example," he said. "Instead of being the privileged ones, we are neglected."
 
 A few kilometres from Morakhla is the Vandarda village that has not seen water in canals for years. "We rely on handpumps for drinking water too. They say that our area is on a higher gradient and hence water from the Narmada canal cannot be provided here," said   from Vandarda. Insufficient income has forced many to take loans they are unable to repay.  , the sarpanch of the Khandiya village in the same area, points out that 15 to 20 persons from his village had taken loans from the Kuvarpura Sahakari Mandali cooperative society.
