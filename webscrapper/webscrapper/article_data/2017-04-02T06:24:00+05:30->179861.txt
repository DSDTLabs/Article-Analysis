Kolkata: Two schoolgoers — 14 years old and studying in Class-IX of a top English medium school of south Kolkata — were picked up by the   police for being involved in a   in the   area. The cops though, have been taken by surprise after realizing how the two friends — one from Kasba and another from   — had perfected the art of theft over one year. This despite the fact both are from upper middle-class backgrounds and do not really have a financial problem back home, claimed police.

 “It is a classic case of how lifestyle pressure from peers dictate your choices. The two boys in question wanted money to cover their daily expenses – eating out and using costly phones. When we apprehended them, we were taken aback when we found the duo had stolen electronic items from even their friends — including iPods and costly mobile phones,” said an investigating officer.
 
 It all started in the middle of March this year when  , a deputy director with the   primary education department, lodged a complaint of theft at his residence. The arrests were made following mobile surveillance, said sources.
 
 Sources said the boys had planned this particular theft for over six months. “They saw how their friend carried the keys of the house with him in his schoolbag. They got hold of this key and got a duplicate made. When they found that the friend was away on a vacation with his family, they sneaked inside the house,” an officer told TOI.
