PATNA: A day after   (TDP) parted ways with NDA, another ally of the ruling coalition, JD (U), on Saturday said its demand for special category status (SCS) to Bihar was still alive and that the party would continue its struggle for the cause.

 “JD (U) has been struggling for SCS to Bihar under the leadership of CM   for last several years. The party has time and again urged the Centre on this. A JD (U) delegation will submit a fresh petition to the 15th Finance Commission, seeking SCS for Bihar,” the party’s secretary general K C Tyagi told TOI on phone from Delhi.
 
 Tyagi, however, made it clear that unlike TDP, JD (U), which is running the government in Bihar in alliance with BJP, will not sever ties with NDA over the issue. “We will not support the YSR Congress-sponsored no-confidence motion against   government in Parliament,” he said. “Every party has its own way of mounting pressure on the Centre over its demands. We will keep pressurising the Centre for special status to Bihar. We also support TDP’s demand. Like Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, too, deserves SCS,” Tyagi said.
