Cutting short travel time by several minutes, the newly built underpass at Raheja Mind Space was inaugurated by IT Minister  . The underpass will be a much needed traffic breather between Biodiversity junction and Cyber towers, as now vehicles going in and out of mind space IT park will not be intercepted by vehicle going to and fro from biodiversity and cyber towers. The project was commissioned at a cost of Rs 26 crores in April 2016 under the strategic road development plan ( ) and took 2 years for completion. 

  
 The underpass is about 500 meter long and bi directional, it also bears a colorful look with abstract mosaic work. Though traffic officials and government say the project will ease traffic, many passers-by say the underpass wouldn't be of much use as the pass is just half a kilometer long and covers just one junction, leaving aside the the junction at Lemon Tree Hotel where traffic from major IT companies like Mahindra, Deloitte, Oracle and Dell come in. 
 
  
 After the inauguration, Minister KTR also promised timely completion of the other projects within their stipulated time frames. which includes the one of a kind cable wire bridge at   and LB nagar flyovers.
