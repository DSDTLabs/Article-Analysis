 is one of the fewest actors in the south cinema industry, who has her preferences and choices straight.

 
 Often, the actress is seen in roles that are author-backed and give an opportunity to showcase her acting prowess. Though it was rumoured that Nithya will be playing a key role in Nag Ashwin's 'Mahanati', a biopic on Savithri, the role simultaneously went to Samantha.
 
 In an interesting turn of events, the movie which was close to Samantha's heart, a thriller made in Kannada, 'U Turn' in which Samantha wanted to play the protagonist's role, now fell in the lap of Nithya Menen. Earlier, Samantha expressed her desire to work in the remake. However, reasons for Samantha walking out of the project remain unknown and Nithya Menen is an apt choice for the same, we must say.
 
 
 Sources say that the bubbly actress is game to do the remake of U Turn in Telugu and has signed on the dotted line already.
 
 
 The movie is in post-production phase and other details are awaited.
