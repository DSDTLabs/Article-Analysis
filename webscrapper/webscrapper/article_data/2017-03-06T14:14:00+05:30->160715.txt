Vishal Bhardwaj’s ambitious love saga, ‘Rangoon’, starring Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and   failed to rake in the expected moolah at the box-office. Now, looks like the talented filmmaker has already set his sights on his next venture.

 According to reports, Vishal is now thinking of adapting Shakespeare’s 17th century comedy ‘Twelfth Night’ for the big screen. A comedy will surely be a refreshing change considering the filmmaker has only helmed adaptations of typical Shakespearean tragedies so far. Be it ‘Maqbool’, ‘Omkara’ or ‘Haider’ – these movies have been adaptations of Shakespearean tragedies ‘Macbeth, ‘Othello’, and ‘Hamlet’ respectively. The ace director has tasted success with his adaptations of the Bard’s works in the past, with all of them being hailed as cinematic gems. So it is no surprise that the 51-year-old filmmaker is reportedly revisiting another of Shakespeare’s dramas.
