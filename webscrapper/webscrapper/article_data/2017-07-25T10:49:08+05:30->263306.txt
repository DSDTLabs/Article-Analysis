CHENNAI: DMK working president M K   on Monday demanded the resignation of   over allegation on the banned gutka and demanded a CBI inquiry into the scam, allegedly involving a minister and senior police officers.

 In a statement, the DMK leader expressed shock over reports of missing of I-T department’s letters to the state government last year, which detailed the bribes to a minister and police officers by gutka manufacturers. “It is a massive conspiracy,” the leader said, wondering about the fate of the communication from the Central agency to then chief secretary P Rama Mohana Rao. Rao, chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan and DGP T K Rajendran are fully responsible for the missing letters and action should be taken against them, Stalin said.
 
 The DMK leader accused the government of hiding the developments in the recently concluded assembly session and appointed Rajendran as DGP. “By his appointment, the chief minister has ruined the administration. He should be removed from service and an honest officer should be appointed,” he said. Terming the chief secretary’s endorsement of appointment of Rajendran as illegal, he said the move had 350 IAS officers hanging their heads in shame.
