HYDERABAD: A major   in   is to be undertaken by authorities soon.

 So far in 2017, there have already been 1,800 forest fires and these 'fire spots' were detected by satellites.
  
  
 From 2014-17, as many as 12,000 fires were reported in Telangana’s forests. With 2018 being declared as 'Fire free forest year', officials are using the latest technology, including information passed on from two satellites to prevent fires.
 
 It has been found in Telangana that all fires are man made. A casually thrown ‘beedi’ by villagers , or deliberately setting some portion of the forest area on fire has been seen as reasons for these fires.
 
 "A fire that spreads easily in the summer burns up 10 to 15 acres of forest area," PCCF, IT and Vigilance, Raghuveer, told TOI. On Monday, there was a forest fire in Yadadri where a huge chunk of forest area got burnt. Some school teachers and Dulapuram forest range staff were asked to put out the fire. There were forest fires in   too which were attended by forest staff beat, and another fire in   section.
 
 PCCF Raghuveer said the information of 'fire spots' is provided by satellites constantly and forest staff act on the alerts sent in the form of SMS.
 
 "Preventing a fire is the top priority," Raghuveer said. For this, forest staff and volunteers will be going to 440 villages which are located close to fire spots that were reported. For suppression of fires, the fire department uses blowers. Government staff is also being told that it is their responsibility to put out fires and not just wait for the forest department to act.
