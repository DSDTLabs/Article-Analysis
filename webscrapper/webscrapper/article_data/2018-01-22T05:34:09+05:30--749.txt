CHANDIGARH: Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader   on Sunday accused the Manohar Lal Khattar-led   government of making   the ‘most unsafe state’ for women and children in the wake of uncontrolled crime against women in the state.

 Choudhry, who chaired the Haryana Bachao rally in Narnaul categorically, said that Khattar’s failure in setting the house in order had resulted in system failure and making bureaucracy and policing out of control. “This government has failed to set even a single example which could act as a deterant for crime against women. Instead, those involved in such crimes have started resorting to brutalities. Now, even educationists are unsafe in schools,” she said.
 
 Choudhry alleged that “you name the department and you shall find some mafia operating there”. Later, she patted the back of her ex-MP daughter Shruti Choudhry for her efforts in getting a huge turnout of Congressmen and women. “It is only the failure of the government, which has led to this turnout. It is not just Bhiwani-Mahendergarh area, but entire Haryana has seen the governance of late Ch   and Surinder Singh. We shall live up to you expectations,” she further said.
 
 In a bid to strike a chord with farmers, both mother and daughter also enquired about the availability of canal water and problems being faced by farmers and poor.
