MUMBAI: A day after eleven resident doctors of state government-run   withdrew their   against dean T P Lahane and opthalmology head Dr Ragini Parekh, the Bombay high court-appointed Justice V C Daga committee said it would continue to look into the complaints made by resident doctors against the dean and Dr Parekh about the academic functioning of the opthalmology department.

 At an emergency meeting convened on Friday, Justice Daga-headed six-member committee also decided that that Dr Lahane and Dr Parekh should not be examiners of the students who had filed the complaint and the examination centre for them should be other than JJ hospital. The committee said the letter sent on Thursday by the 11 students would be investigated as to under what circumstances it was handed over. The Justice Daga committee also recommended that the guide of resident doctor Priyanka Singh, who was one of the main complainants last year, should be changed. 
 
 Incidentally, she is not a signatory to the withdrawal letter sent on Thursday.
 
 The committee requested Department of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to ensure compliance of its decisions. The committee’s decision have to be implemented through Maharashtra University of   Sciences (MUHS). 
 
 On Friday, DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said, “We called the students who said, in writing, that they were withdrawing their complaint against Dr Lahane. They said the committee should continue and they were not saying this under any undue pressure.”
 
 Advocate Rahul Totala, who appears for MARD in the high court, had earlier argued that a proper inquiry into the grievances raised by resident doctors at JJ Hospital was essential.
 
 Representatives of the MARD refused to comment on the matter.
