AGRA: Four policemen, including the SHO of  , were attached to Police Lines on Saturday for not registering an   of an injured man who had come to the police station in the morning.   Amit Pathak took this action after Hakim Singh, a vegetable vendor in Shahganj area, came to his office and narrated his ordeal. The complainant had an injury on his head.
 
  Instead of directing the Shahganj station in-charge to file an FIR, the SSP took Singh along with him to the police station.
  
  “The vegetable seller had come to the police station around 9am after he suffered a head injury in a scuffle with another man. SHO Vinay Mishra was not available at that time. The on-duty constable asked him to get a written complaint, which he eventually did, reportedly after paying Rs 200 to a man. However, even after receiving the written complaint, the constable turned him away,” said a source in the police department.
  
  After inquiring into the matter, the SSP found that Shahganj police station did not have a help desk to assist victims in filing a written complaint. “The SSP was surprised to know that the cops at the station hadn’t even paid heed to the other man involved in the scuffle even though he had been waiting there for over an hour,” said the source.
  
  Later, in an official press release, the   said that SHO Vinay Mishra and three other cops, including one sub-inspector and two constables, were sent to Police Lines for failing to follow to the SSP’s orders and refusing to file an FIR on a victim’s complaint.
  
  In another case, SSP   suspended one sub-inspector and a constable attached to Basai police outpost. An audio clip of SI Vijay Kant Sharma and constable Munesh Jadaun surfaced in which they were heard asking for bribe from bookies and using offensive language against the SSP.
