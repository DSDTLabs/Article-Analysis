MUMBAI: It was 15 minutes of complete panic and fear for commuters on board the first air-conditioned electrical multiple unit (EMU) rake on Tuesday as the doors failed to open at   station due to a technical snag. The train had travelled from Churchgate and Virar was the last stop. 

 The incident took place around 1.15pm. This is the first incident of a snag reported since the rake was first introduced on December 25.
 
 Admitting a technical problem, WR's divisional railway manager Mukul Jain said, "The software was reading the train was in motion, hence the doors were not opening."
 
 Usually, command of the door is with the guard, but his role is only limited to ensure its closure.
 
 Eyewitnesses said passengers stuck inside panicked. Sources said lack of announcement within the rake also added to confusion.
 
 According to one eyewitness, the air-conditioner too was not working because of which passengers felt suffocated. The passengers were able to exit after one of the technical staff managed to open one of the doors.
 
  The train left for Churchgate with a delay of 20 minutes. 
 
 A   said, "This is the first time the rake has faced a technical problem."
 
 In the event of a snag,   has no spare rake as this is the only one manufactured and delivered to Mumbai by the Integral coach factory in Chennai.
