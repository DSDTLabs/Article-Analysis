GUWAHATI: As many as six thermal power projects with a combined installed capacity of 992 MW are being set up by the state-owned power generation company in Assam. 

 Union minister of state for power  , in reply to a question by AIUDF MP  , informed the Lok Sabha that at present there is no hydroelectric power project from Assam under consideration for concurrence of the   (CEA).
 
 The minister stated that as per the information furnished by the CEA, the power projects proposed to be set up in the state are the 660-MW Margherita Project, 12-MW Golaghat Project, 70-MW Lakwa Replacement Project, 30-MW Cachar project, 100-MW Amguri Project and 120-MW Lower Kopili Project.

 According to  , it is now supplying power to the extent of 95% to 100% during off-peak hours and to 90% to 95% during peak (evening) hours.
 
 The APDCL website says that there has been a steep rise in the demand for power during the last three to four years in the state. "In Guwahati alone, there has been a three-fold increase in demand for power in the past five years. Until a couple of years ago, only 16% rural households were electrified which has now enhanced to about 50%. But as per the National Electricity Policy, steps have been undertaken to electrify every household of Assam by 2019. As such, there has been a great increase in demand for power in rural as well as urban areas in recent times," the website adds. 
 
 Official sources said the average peak demand for power in the state is 1400 MW, which is a two-fold jump over the demand five years ago. However, the total availability of power at present is around 1200 MW, which includes just 260 MW from the state's own generations. The state's primary source of power is hydro generation, which accounts for about 60% of the total existing power availability.
