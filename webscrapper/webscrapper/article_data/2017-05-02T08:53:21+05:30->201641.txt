Uma Shankar asks   to listen to him, but she refuses to listen and keeps sitting in the washroom. Kanak starts missing her brothers, who used to scare her when the lights went out.
 
  Uma brings a lantern and places it outside the washroom and sits on the floor outside. Both of them fall asleep sitting on the floor, one inside the washroom and the other outside. While asleep, Kanak falls inside the bath tub and then Uma Shankar hands her a towel, but she refuses to take it. Kanak then changes and wears Uma Shankar's shirt.
  
  In the morning Uma Shankar wakes up Kanak by knocking on the door and tells her that they have kept a pooja in the house and he also keeps her clothes ready in the room. As soon as he leaves from the room, Uma realises that he left the lantern burning and returns to put it off, but sees a happy Kanak doing it.
  
  
 
  
  Meanwhile,   comes to the Kanak sweet shop and asks Bhabho to make something sweet for him. He picks up a laddoo and eats it, then praises Bhabho and takes an entire box of sweets. Vansh goes outside and thinks that someday or the other the truth will be out and she would come to know that she doesn't prepare tasty sweets anymore.
  
  Masi sa asks Uma if everything is fine between him and Kanak, but the latter says that everything will get better with time. While everyone waits to see Kanak in the best of clothes and jewellery, she comes out in a dress.
