NEW DELHI: Call it the power of music or the power of The Beatles. Whatever it was, it recently brought   chief minister   and his political opponents together on stage quite harmoniously, as they belted out  ' classic track 'All My Loving'.

 During Sangma's daughter's wedding celebrations, the proud father took to the stage and began crooning The Beatles' love anthem. Soon, he was joined on stage by leader of the opposition  , the United Democratic Party ( ) president Paul Lyngdoh, and   minister Prestone Tynsong. 
 
 The quartet enthralled the audience with their performance, with minister Tynsong's lively moves deserving a special mention.
 
 
 
 
 This isn't the first time Sangma has performed in public. Part of a rock band in his college days, the chief minister thrilled people with his rendition of  's 'I Want to Break Free' at a NICT-Meghabytes event back in 2012. He again displayed his musical skills during the inauguration of Meghalaya House in Kolkata in 2015.
 
 UDP leader Lyngdoh also doubles as a recording artist, with several hit songs under his belt.
 
 With Shillong being the rock capital of India, it's small wonder that its leaders know how to get their people to groove.
