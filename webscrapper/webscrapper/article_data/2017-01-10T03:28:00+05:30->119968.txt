Panaji: A complaint has been filed with the Goa State   Commission on Monday over non-exemption of single parent (women) teachers from election duties.

 The respondents (the chief secretary and chief electoral officer) have failed to lay down guidelines mandating that whenever there is a single woman parent, she should not be requisitioned for election duties. 
 
 “The non-grant of such exemption from election duties is causing great hardship and suffering and tension to the single women parents who are, as a consequence of election duties, are unable to look after their families,” the complaint filed by advocate Satish Sonak said, besides adding that it amounts to violation of their human rights if they are unable to take personal care of their family including children due to election duties. 
 
 The human rights of their children and senior citizens in the families are also similarly violated, he added.
 
 “Employing teachers for election duties during school hours results in interruptions in their courses, high dropout rates, poor results and inability to complete in open examinations. There are no exceptional reasons as to why single women parent-teachers should be compelled to do election duties,” Sonak stated, requesting the commission to recommend the government of Goa and the chief electoral officer to place on record whether they have allotted election duties to any single woman parent teacher, lecturer or professor. 
 
 He has also prayed that the government lay down guidelines that no single woman parent, including those who are teachers, lecturers and professors, ever be forced to carry out election duties.
