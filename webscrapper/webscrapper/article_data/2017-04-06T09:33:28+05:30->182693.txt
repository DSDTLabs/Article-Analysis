PUNE: The civic body, along with state home department’s special cell for women and children, will conduct year-long   for municipal school students to avert child sexual abuse.

 “The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken the initiative, as it is the need of the hour. We have roped in NGOs for this. They are experts in the sector and create awareness about the sensitive issue,” Vasanti Kakade, chairperson of the PMC’s school education board, said on Wednesday.
 
 Vaishali Ranade, coordinator and counsellor of the special cell (Pune), said children mostly from the poor section of society are enrolled in civic schools. “It has been observed that parents of these students come from the working class and pay less attention towards them,” she told TOI.
 
 “Most parents are not educated or aware about child sexual abuse and its impact on the children. Such cases may result in traumas or can create psychological issues,” Ranade said, adding that child sexual abuse can be averted by imparting knowledge to the students.
 
 Ranade said that so far, she and other officers of the cell have conducted two workshops at two civic schools. “It was found that the children are intelligent, but there is hardly any communication between them and their parents. It was also observed there is an issue of alcohol abuse and domestic violance in the homes of these children. There is a need for raising awareness of sexual abuse among the children,” she added.
 
 “The children must know the difference between good touch and bad touch. We will educate them on how not to fall prey to allurements. Basically, the workshops will be educative and informative and will focus on preventive or precautionary measures,” she said.
 
 The special cell is being run across the state by the home department in coordination with   (TISS), Mumbai.
