LUDHIANA: A day after a woman accused three policemen of detaining her “illegally” in a lock-up for entire night, and thrashing and molesting her, a video has gone viral wherein she admits to have beaten up a woman cop in self-defence.

 “After the cops thrashed and molested me, a woman cop in civvies came to my lock-up and slapped me for no reason. In retaliation, I slapped her back,” she says in the video.
 
 On Monday, the woman had submitted a complaint to police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill against the three policemen of Salem Tabri. “No woman cop was present at the police station when I was locked up on April 7,” she had told the top cop. 
 
 Gill marked an inquiry to assistant commissioner of police (north) Lakhveer Singh Tiwana.
 
 In her complaint, the 35-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy alleged that she had taken Rs 1.5-lakh loan from a Jalandhar financier. When he came to collect the money on April 7, her brother-in-law reached there and called the police. She said her brother-in-law used his “influence” and asked the cops to take her and the financier to the police station.
 
 She did not mention what happened to the financier after that.
 
 The ACP, however, said, “The police, on the complaint of area residents, had detained all three after they came to blows. The trio was bailed out the next morning.”
 
 When asked about absence of women cops, the ACP said, “According to the attendance records, women cops were present at the police station.”
 
 The complainant told the TOI, “Between 4pm and 5pm, three cops thrashed me badly, tore my clothes and molested me. They then called a woman cop, who came in civvies and started slapping me. I thrashed her back in my defence.”
