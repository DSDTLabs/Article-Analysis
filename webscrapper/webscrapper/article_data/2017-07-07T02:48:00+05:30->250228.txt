MUMBAI: The BJP is raising a stink over the BEST committee’s decision to allot a portion of its depot plot in Shivajinagar to a   contractor for less than a third of the market rate for a casting yard without inviting tenders. 

 BJP corporator Kamlesh Yadav has written to civic chief Ajoy Mehta demanding an inquiry. 
 
 BJP group leader in the   Manoj Kotak said, “It is surprising that they allotted the plot just because the contractor had made a request. There was no tender invited, which is mandatory, and they allotted the plot at Rs 13 per ft although the market rate in the area is more than Rs 40 per ft.”
 
 It is stated that the road contractor is constructing a bridge in the area and according to the tender condition he needed to arrange all the work requirement without depending on the BMC. Politicians expressed surprised over the BEST committee’s move to bypass the process to allot the 26,029 sq m plot. “We are unaware of the contractor’s background except for the fact that he is involved with a road contract awarded by the BMC,” said BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya. The members in the panel however cleared the proposal through a majority vote. 
 
  BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said that the plot was being given on lease in accordance with the ready-reckoner rates. The plot will fetch the undertaking Rs 4.21 crore for over 2 years, sources said.
