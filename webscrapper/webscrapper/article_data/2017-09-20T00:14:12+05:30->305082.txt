Dindigul: In a gaffe by the civil supplies and consumer protection department, a family head from Dindigul has received a ‘smart’ card with the image of Indian flag wrongly embossed on it, instead of his own photo. 

 The recipient, who noticed the error, expressed fear that he may not be able to get his share in the public distribution system as a result. 
 
 While a complaint has been made with the authorities concerned, he was assured that the issue would be sorted out soon.
 
 The card with the pictorial error was issued to one Dhayalsultan Kadher Ravuthar from Ottar Street in Obulapuram near Ayakudi in Palani Circle. The mistake appears to be an isolated case, as all his neighbours have got their photos right.
 
 According to officials, the error happened in Chennai where its printing was done. 
 
 Minister for food and civil supplies R Kamaraj said the error was due to the upload through mobile phone application. He assured that this would not recur again.
 
 This blunder was similar to a few ones earlier reported from other parts of the state recently. A card-holder from Salem had got one which was embossed with the image of actress Kajal Aggarwal. In a couple of other such incidents, family heads from Tirupur and Dharmapuri districts got their smart cards with the pictures of Lord Vinayaka and slippers, respectively.
