PATNA: The JD(U) led by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar will not contest Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly election. The decision was taken at the party’s core committee meeting here, said party’s secretary general K C Tyagi on Wednesday. He also said Nitish would not campaign for any political party in  .

 The decision surprised many as Nitish himself was trying to increase the JD(U) footprint and addressed at least six public meetings in UP in the last few months. It was even in talks with some smaller parties to form an alliance and contest the polls. 
 
 Talking to newsmen, Tyagi said the decision was taken to prevent division of secular votes. “We wanted Bihar-like Mahagathbandhan in UP to ensure easy defeat of communal forces like BJP. We are pained that   and   (SP) ignored the plan. Unlike SP, which walked out of Bihar’s alliance and contested polls in 2015 assembly election, we are not going to join the fray. We hope our decision will prevent division of secular votes,” said Tyagi, who was flanked by state’s water resource minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and JD(U) general secretary Shyam Rajak. 
 
 JD(U), RJD and Congress had initially offered just three out of 243 seats to SP before Bihar assembly election last year. Later, RJD agreed to give two more seats from its quota of 101, but SP refused the offer and contested 85 seats, though could not open its account. 
 
 When asked whether Nitish or any other JD(U) leader will campaign for SP or Congress in UP, if invited, Lalan said, “The two parties did not consider us fit for any vote. There is no reason why anyone should seek our help. Even if any party requests us, no one (including Nitish) will campaign for any party in UP polls.” He, however, said, “We will pray that secular parties win UP election.”
 
 The JD(U) leaders said a Bihar-like alliance in UP could have ensured smooth sail for secular forces in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
