Vijayawada: Astrophiles in city who were gearing up for the triple lunar eclipse on Wednesday are now left disappointed thanks to the   Planetarium, which is closed for renovation works.

 “Gandhi Hill Planetarium is a major science centre. We used to spend a lot of time there to learn about space. In fact, eclipses could be viewed with powerful telescopes there. It was a great feeling,” says M. Harnath a science teacher in the city.
 
 The planetarium is currently in a pathetic condition as it has failed to technically upgrade itself. The projector and other scientific equipment were installed about forty years ago. They are not functioning properly. Gandhi Hill Foundation closed the observatory seven ago for renovation. “We closed it for renovation. The expert team inspected the planetarium. Hope it will be reopened soon,” said planetarium manager S Baig.
 
  in the city has been a major tourist attraction in the city since early 1970s. Around 200 to 300 children along with their parents used to visit the planetarium. School managements used to conduct study tours at the observatory. Special camps were held conducted during solar eclipse, lunar eclipse to educate students.
 
 “Science and technology should be given top priority. Motivating youth toward scientific education is important. Now, there is not a single place in Vijayawada to see the lunar eclipse. We should feel shamed about this,” said Jampa Krishna Kishore, functionary at Jana Vignana Vedika. The state government which is spending crores on science and technology should focus on developing Gandhi planetarium which has a history of five decades, he added.
