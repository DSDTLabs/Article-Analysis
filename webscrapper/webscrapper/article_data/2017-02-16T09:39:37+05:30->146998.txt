LUCKNOW: Calling BJP “Bharatiya Jumlonwali Party” and Modi a “Bewafaa pradhanmantri”, UP   president   here on Wednesday said in ‘SCAM’, S stands for Sangh, C for corporate, A for   and M for Modi. He accused the BJP leaders of fooling people in the name of fight against black money through demonetization. He was addressing a public meeting in Nishatganj while campaigning in favour of Congress candidate in Lucknow East assembly constituency Anurag Bhadauria.

 “Modi ordered demonetisation claiming it would curb black money but it only hit small businessmen, farmers and the poor,” said Babbar and accused Modi of ditching ‘Maa Ganga‘ by not fulfilling the promise to rejuvenate the river. He said in the two-and-a-half years of BJP rule there has only been plain talk. “So now, no more ‘Mann ki Baat‘, only ‘Kaam Ki Baat’,” said Babbar replacing Modi’s signature show with Akhilesh’s poll slogan.
