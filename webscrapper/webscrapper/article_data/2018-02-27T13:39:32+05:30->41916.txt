Ramanathapuram:   officials at the   (GoMMNP) recovered a whopping 1,489 turtle eggs from 13 nesting sites along Ramanathapuram coast on Monday morning. According to official sources, this is the first time they have collected so many eggs in a single day, higher than Sunday, when they collected 1,304 eggs from 11 nesting sites.

 “We have collected 13,000 more eggs along Ramanathapuram coast in the previous season, a record number for nesting season along the coast. Even then, the highest recovery on a day was more than 600 eggs. This is first time, the daily recovery started crossing 1,000 mark,” forest ranger officer of   range, S  .
 
 After turtle nesting season started this year, based on instructions from wildlife warden, T K  , officials started gathering the eggs from nests, securing them in a hatchery at Mukuntharayarchathiram. A 15-member-team consisting of local fishermen and anti-poaching watchers are keeping vigil on the seashore along the national park, looking for possible nesting sites, and gathering the eggs to hatchery upon spotting one.
 
 Collective efforts paid rich dividends last year, as 12,000 out of 13,000 turtle eggs hatched and officials are speculating that the number of eggs will cross last year’s figure this time. The total number of eggs collected is 10,458 eggs from 89 nesting sites so far. The season is expected to last till March end or mid-April like it happened in previous year. “We released 12,000 hatchlings in the sea last year, which was rewarding to all our conservative measures,” Sathish said.
