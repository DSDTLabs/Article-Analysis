 Some 537 students of Cept varsity who completed their courses in 2016-17 received their graduation degrees at the convocation on Saturday. These include 25 students who were awarded doctorate degrees in addition to some 326 students who got their post-graduate degrees and 186 who were conferred with undergraduate degrees.
 
 Prof Bertaud encouraged urban planners to keep in mind the larger purpose of bringing about a change in the city. 
 
 “Urban planners are often in despair,” he said. “They produce plans which are not implemented. After this they cease to take responsibility for lack of implementation. Their job is not only to come up with good ideas but convince stakeholders to implement them about improving the way cities are developed,” Bertaud said.
 
 “If we mess up urbanization by missing our goals, it will lead to disaster. Hence it’s your responsibility to bring about change on the ground,” Bertaud said
