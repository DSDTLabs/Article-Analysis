BHAGALPUR: A newly married woman in Bhagalpur district left her husband’s home the very next day for lack of   there. She returned to her in-laws’ place only after her husband promised to get a toilet constructed within two days. 

 Twenty-year-old Kanchan of   village under Rupauli block of   district was married to Rudal Sharma of ward number 1 of Milki Tola under the Dholbajja police station area in Naugachia subdivision of Bhagalpur district on Thursday last. When she reached her husband’s home on Friday, she had to go out in the field after sunset to answer the call of nature. She left for her parents’ home next morning.
 
 The information about Kanchan leaving her husband’s home for   in the house spread like a wildfire in the village. Not only the relatives and neighbours but the entire village turned up at Rudal’s house and reprimanded him and his family for bringing shame to them.
 
 Soon, the elders of the village called a community meeting where Rudal’s father Yogendra Mistri promised to construct a toilet within a week. Accompanied by a few village seniors, he went to Kanchan’s maternal home and persuaded her to return to her in- law’s place with a promise that toilet would be constructed within two days.
