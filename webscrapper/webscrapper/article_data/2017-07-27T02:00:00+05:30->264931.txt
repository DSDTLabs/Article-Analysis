PATNA: The  , shut since March 28, is set to reopen for public on the Gandhi Jayanti day on October 2.

 The museum was scheduled to reopen on April 8, but sources said it would take at least five more months to rectify the construction snags and fulfil maintenance needs. As of now, 102 original artefacts have been transferred from the Patna Museum to Bihar Museum.
 
 CM Nitish Kumar inaugurated the museum on August 7, 2015 with a vision to extravagantly represent Bihar’s history and heritage. It was, however, shut after detection of structural and fabrication snags coming in way of its “high international standards”. 
 
 Project contractor Larsen & Toubro Limited has been carrying out the rectification work ever since. 
 
 The museum had opened with two functional galleries. The children’s gallery offered a peep into Bihar’s history and natural history through experiential learning zones. The orientation gallery provided archaeological insights. 
 
 Owing allegedly to frequent conflicts between the architectural consultant Maki & Associates and L&T, several local factors were not taken into consideration during the construction of the six-storey, low-slung building spread over 5.6 hectares.
 
 After the rectification work is complete, eight additional galleries will be opened focusing on regional art, contemporary art, Bihari diaspora, historical art and visible storage, among others.
 
 The colossal structure also houses exhibition spaces, providing chronological narrative of Indian history represented through diverse interiors and exteriors.
