 Chugh was speaking on the sidelines of a bank event to kick off its second digital innovation summit. 
 
 The summit is a contest for fintech companies to win an opportunity to partner with the bank for developing technology. For the second summit, the bank has sought entries on Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), block chain and rural fin-tech.
 
 The bank has also unveiled its mobile humanoid IRA which is an acronym for Intelligent Robotic Assistant, which will assist customers at branches using artificial intelligence.
 
 “We chose to build a humanoid which was designed and built in India rather than importing a mass-produced machine,” said Chugh. IRA will be unveiled in one of HDFC Bank’s branches in a fortnight.
