HYDERABAD: There may be a thaw in the offing between the government and residents of Vemulaghat village that has been the epicentre of resistance to government efforts to acquire land for the   project. It may be recalled that for more than a year, Vemulaghat has been the focus of protest against the government plan to acquire land, with many villagers resisting every offer made by the government to part with their land.

 On Saturday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao sat with nearly a 100 residents of Vemulaghat and explained why giving up their land in the village for the project is absolutely vital for development of the region comprising Ranga Reddy, Medak, Nizamabad, Warangal and   districts. KCR met with the villagers at his farm house in Erravelli village on Saturday and spent time answering questions from the villagers and explaining that those giving their land for the project will be the ones breathing life, providing the heartbeat for development and upliftment of not just their own lives but those of others as well.
 
 Vemulaghat had proved a tough nut to crack so far for the government that promised several incentives as per GO 123 in a bid to acquire land for the project. On Saturday, it was learnt that the CM explained all the benefits each family will receive, including a two-bedroom house that will be built by the government. The government had already prom ised a compensation of Rs 7 lakh an acre of land with a borewell and Rs 5.8 lakh for an acre without a borewell. Even those without land in the village have been promised compensation by the government. It is now hoped that with the chief minister interacting with the villagers, it may not be very long before the government is able to move ahead with land acquisition in Vemulaghat for the   project.
 
 The 50 TMCft capacity Mallannasagar reservoir, part of the Rs 9,800 PranahitaKandi project, requires acquisition of about 16,000 acres in   and   mandals.
