 Talking about the importance of sports in today's time, Rijiju, said, "Gone are those days when only studies could make you successful. Sports are as important as studies. We should do away with the age-old proverb, 'Padhoge, likhoge toh banoge nawab, kheloge, koodoge toh hoge kharaab.' We should rather encourage, 'Padhoge, kheloge, koodoge toh banoge nawab.'"
