DHARWAD:   of  , who having been staging protests since the past two years demanding the linking of   river with  , have now sought the President’s permission for euthanasia in the event their demand is not fulfilled. They submitted a memorandum, addressed to the President, at the deputy commissioner’s office in   on Wednesday.

 The protesters took out a rally before staging a sit-in protest in front of the deputy commissioner’s office. They stated that the government and   companies have been indifferent to their problems, making the life of farmers miserable.
 
 Due to drought in the   and rabi seasons, Navalgund taluk recorded 100% crop loss and all the investments made by farmers were wasted, the memorandum said. Insurance companies have not paid compensation in a scientific manner, the memorandum said. Uniform crop compensation pattern has caused more loss to genuine crop losers, the protesters said.
 
 A large number of crops were damaged due to floods in Bennihall and the government is yet to release the compensation despite conducting a survey.
 
 Some farmers, who managed to grow green gram and onion, were in for a tough time when there was a drastic dip in their prices. After repeated appeals, the government announced a minimum support price for green gram and onion. 
 
 However, there is an inordinate delay in releasing the amount to the farmers. 
 
 Even after two months of purchase of the produce, there is still no information from the government on the release of money, the protesters said.
 
 They also demanded withdrawal of cases against the farmers booked for protest in Navalgund.
