LUCKNOW: The   leadership on Friday went into an overdrive and summoned its UP president   to New Delhi, triggering speculation about changes in the party as well as in the state cabinet headed by chief minister  . 

 The move came a day after the party was defeated by the joint opposition in Kairana and Noorpur by-elections.
 
 The development came amid Yogi chalking out plans to visit   strongholds and hold meetings with government officials and party functionaries. Yogi, who visited   on Friday, will reach Hardoi, the home turf of SP turncoat  , on Saturday and then to Bhadohi on Sunday. He is also scheduled to meet BJP MPs, MLAs, district-level presidents and RSS functionaries in Kanpur, Awadh and Varanasi.
 
 Soon after the bypoll results were announced on Thursday, Pandey called a meeting of party functionaries, including organisational secretary Sunil Bansal, late Thursday night, sources said, adding Pandey and Bansal prepared a report to be submitted before BJP national chief Amit Shah. On Friday, Pandey rushed to Delhi.
 
 "The party has been grappling with charges of corruption at the government level and the failure of public delivery mechanism," said a senior BJP leader. "It is not until corrective measures are taken at the organisation as well as the government level, things would improve," he added. The development came amid the party's falling vote share vis-a-vis united opposition in the by-elections. BJP's vote share in Kairana dropped from around 52% in 2014 to around 47%, even though poll percentage was low. BJP has been seeking to increase its vote share by at least 50% to counter a united opposition, comprising mainly SP, BSP and Congress.
