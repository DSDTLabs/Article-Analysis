It was a special night for over 10,000 Hyderabadis as they danced to the music of the EDM icon   on Saturday night at the HITEX Convention Centre. We hear that the gig was attended by quite a few celebrities like  ,  ,   and Nithiin also. But the highlight of the event was when David wished everyone ‘Happy Sankranthi’, as the crowd raised their David Guetta autographed kites in the air. What followed was a dance fest complete with lasers and pyrotechnics as David played a host of his popular songs like This One’s For You, Shed A Light and No Worries.
