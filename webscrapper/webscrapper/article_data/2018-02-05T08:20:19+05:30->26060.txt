 The incident took place around 6.50pm and the trio managed to exit the lift half-an-hour later, when passersby heard their shouts and contacted the BBMP. “The government has spent so much money on skywalks, but the lifts don’t even work properly. There was no attendant monitoring the lift area either. Basically, there was no way to seek help. They must ensure all lifts work properly,” said one of the men on exiting the lift. The identities of those trapped in the lift couldn’t be ascertained.

 “Once the BBMP got the call, we immediately informed the company, which sent a mechanic to fix the lift. On Sunday, the lift was inspected and declared to be working properly. The commissioner has asked the company to submit a report on the incident,” he said.
