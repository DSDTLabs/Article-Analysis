JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court on Friday disposed of the contempt petition against state BJP president   after he tendered an unconditional apology. The court let off   by warning him of not to repeat the mistake in future.

 The division bench of   and V K Vyas gave the order on a contempt petition by lawyer PC Bhandari. Parnami was personally present in the court during the hearing.
 
 Parnami was accused of allowing construction of parking lot in a public park in his constituency despite a court ban.
 
 Filing an unconditional apology, he said that he meant no disrespect to the court. Besides, he said, the alleged statement was carried only on a single newspaper. The paper carried only a part of his statement and if the full statement is read that do not amount to contempt of the court. Tendering an unconditional apology, he pleaded for letting him off of the charge of contempt.
 
 A video had gone viral in which the residents of Sector IV of Jawahar Nagar, part of his Adarsh Nagar constituency, were seen requesting Parnami to allow them to park their vehicles in a park due to lack of space on the roads. Parnami reportedly said, “Government cannot allow this as there is a court stay, but you do it and we will keep our eyes shut.”
