NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) government will do away with property tax on residential units “with immediate effect” if it wins the April 23 municipal polls, CM   announced here on Saturday.

 Going flat out to woo voters, he promised to write off all residential property tax arrears. However, taxes on commercial and industrial property will remain.
 
 His promise drew sharp reactions from rivals. BJP called it “shameful”, Congress said that AAP only made “tall promises”.
 
 The city has nearly 10.3 lakh residential property tax payers. In the current fiscal, ending March 31, all three civic bodies have collected Rs 1,330 crore in property tax.
 
 This includes levies from commercial and industrial units. Roughly 30% of total eligible properties pay house tax. Large-scale evasion remains a major problem.
 
 “We are making this promise after a thorough study and planning,” Kejriwal said.
