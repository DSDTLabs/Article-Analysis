VIJAYAWADA: Showing little remorse over the fact that 10 people had died in an accident involving a Volvo bus belonging to his  , Diwakar Travels owner and ruling  , who is brother of  , claimed that it was his fate that there was no higher wall at the culvert where the bus crashed. "Despite my son-in-law (Dinesh Reddy) getting a seat (MLC seat), I am not happy because of this tragedy. I would like to think it is my ill-fate that the incident had happened," Prabhakar said addressing reporters surrounding him in Anantapur.

 While deputy   E Meera Prasad said the vehicle was cruising at 120 kmph, Diwakar Reddy surprisingly claimed that the vehicle was going at 70-75 kmph speed. "It is unfortunate that the incident happened but the vehicle was maintaining t a stable speed," Diwakar said, shocking the senses of the injured. While Penuganchiprolu police filed a case against Diwakar Travels under sections 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of IPC, the police are also waiting for the post-mortem report of the driver to ascertain whether he was under the influence of alcohol.
 
 It wasn't the ill-fate of Prabhakar as the Volvo bus (AP 02 TC 7146) had a history of violating traffic rules and was fined Rs 2,000 for rash driving last month at Kathipudi checkpost in East Godavari. The fine did not deter the vehicle from travelling at super speed on the highways. Last year, Diwakar Travels was mired in a controversy after TRS legislator V Srinivas Goud accused TDP MP Diwakar and his family of running 'illicit' operations. Fortyfive passengers had died after their bus was gutted in an accident in Mahbubnagar district.
 
 Meanwhile, AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu directed the officials to use GPS to keep vigil on overspeeding vehicles. Ironically, Prabhakar in the morning claimed that the bus had GPS. Naidu also directed the officials to act tough on drunken driving cases.
