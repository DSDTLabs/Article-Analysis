JAIPUR: The state   has made Aadhaar card compulsory for students applying for admission in private schools under the 25% Right to Education (RTE) quota.

 As the decision was taken days before the expected RTE notification for admissions, the government will take an undertaking from parents of submitting the Aadhaar card of their wards before September 31, 2017.
 
 Officials reasoned that this card would help these students receive scholarship amount directly. The state has over 2.5 lakh seats under the RTE quota.
 
 Interestingly, several   (SC) orders had made Aadhaar not compulsory for government schemes.
 
 “This move is being done to transfer benefits of all Central and state government scholarships directly into the account of students. Also this would help to stop the duplication of RTE applications as many cases in which a child has been enrolled both in government and private schools have been reported,” said a government official.
 
 The unique ID card will have to be submitted before physical verification, and those students who fail to submit the same may lose admissions.
 
 Officials have also hinted that they would soon make Aadhaar compulsory for all school students. Considering the fact that opening accounts would be difficult for RTE students as they belong to economically disadvantaged and socially backward communities, the state has also planned to hold special account camps in schools.
 
 Officials have said that the notification was expected in 3-4 days and the first list may be published by March-end. The state has asked the HRD ministry about the legalities of reducing the existing income limit of Rs 2.5 lakh. If officials are to be believed, the state is keen to reduce the income limit to Rs 1.5 lakh. “The whole idea is to provide the benefits of this Act to real beneficiaries,” an official said.
