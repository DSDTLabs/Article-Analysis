PANAJI: Goa   of Secondary and Higher Secondary   recently issued an ultimatum to all higher secondary schools in the state to make basic facilities like   and separate toilets for girls and boys available to students within the next three years. The decision, announced on May 5, came after some city-based higher secondary schools were found to be lacking the said facilities during routine inspections.

 Earlier in 2016, the directorate of education had made a declaration to the Union human resources development ministry that all schools under it offering classes I to X provide separate toilets for girls and boys.
 
 Board officials also observed that several higher secondary schools are being headed by in-charges in the absence of fulltime principals.
 
 Following these observations, it was decided to set a time frame for the institutes to meet the necessary requirements. A circular was issued to schools last week.
 
 “It is informed that every higher secondary school should have regular principal, access to playground, separate toilets for boys and girls and the schools should not function in commercial premises / residential flats. Schools which do not comply with these conditions should initiate steps to comply with the same within three years,” reads the circular.
