Nagpur: The plan of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) to get the dome of Deekshabhoomi stupa repaired is unable to take off as properly qualified contractors are not available. It is a specialized work and expertise in this field is required. 

 All the bidders in two tenders were disqualified. NIT has now called the tender the third time and is ready to accept the bid even if one contractor participates in the tender, according to chairman Dipak Mhaisekar. The repair work is expected to take at least a year.
 
 When Union social justice minister Thawar Chand Gehlot visited the site in February 2016, the office-bearers of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Smarak Samiti told him about the damaged dome. Gehlot sanctioned Rs 9 crore for its repair.
 
 Structural engineer Dilip Mase had surveyed the dome and suggested chemical treatment to extend its life. This work requires special steel centering for treatment. The Samiti office-bearers insisted on involvement of a government agency in the repair work and roped in state PWD.
 
 PWD surveyed the dome and revised the estimate of repair work to Rs 9.46 crore. However, the department refused to undertake the work as it did not have the required expertise. Then, NIT was asked to do the job by guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule using central funds.
 
 NIT along with experts of VNIT did a joint survey of the dome. Experts suggested use of poly urea material for filling of the gap and chemical treatment. They also suggested micro-concrete layer, stone layer from outside and copper layer inside the dome. NITâ€™s estimate for the job was Rs 7.35 crore.
 
 Deekshabhoomi holds special significance for the Dalit community as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar had converted to Buddhism here in 1956.
