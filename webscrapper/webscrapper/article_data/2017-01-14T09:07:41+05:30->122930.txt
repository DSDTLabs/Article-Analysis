NAGPUR: “Parents or guardian only want   for their children. They often mistake that quality education is to study in   school. But, quality of education does not depend on language. They put their students in the English medium schools not worrying whether they are after all able to grasp the language,” said  , a noted education expert. 

 Speaking at the DV Fadnavis lecture series organized by Stree Shikshan Prasarak Mandal at Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Nandanvan, Kulkarni said, “I think that the state of Marathi medium schools should be improved along with a mandatory report check of English medium schools.” 
 
 “Mostly, adivasis are in a dilemma whether to invest in child’s education or make him do what his family has been doing. The latter always remains the easiest option. Due to this, the dropout ratio in schools is increasing,” he said.
 
 About ashram schools in Vidarbha, he said that 480 children died due to food poisoning or some other reason.
 
  “If it was even one student from a renowned school who would have died, the news would have spread all over. We find it easy to digest the death of poverty stricken children,” he pointed out.
