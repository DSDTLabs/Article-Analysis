HYDERABAD: Chief minister   expressed 'strong displeasure' over the initial lackadaisical investigation by the police and forest departments into the March 19 Spotted   in   district that allowed the disappearance of Akbar Khan, a local TRS strongman and a prime accused in the case. 

 The chief minister is learnt to have told officials that the probe into the poaching must progress rapidly and taken to a logical end at the soonest. The chief minister, sources said, was of the opinion that the dragging on of the probe, especially with TRS leaders being involved in the case, will result in damage to the ruling party that must be contained to a manageable level. 
 
 Finally with a go ahead coming right from the top, police officials have intensified their searches and sources said one more of the accused, N Gattaiah, a 'mandal level' TRS leader from   has been taken into custody after tracing him out over the past few days. "The rest of the accused will also be arrested soon," a police officer said. The police have so far identified nine persons as accused with three of them, including the father of a police officer, in custody. Five more accused, including Akbar Khan are still on the loose.
 
 Meanwhile, forest department is learnt to have received day custody of the three men to have been arrested first - Nallavelu Sathyanarayana alias 'Shikari Sattenna', Khaleemulla Khan, and   - and take them to the   forest area to find out the locations where they hunted the Spotted Deer, the state animal. 
 
 This is expected to help officials recreate the events of March 19 night, when the animals were poached using high powered 'sporting rifles'.
