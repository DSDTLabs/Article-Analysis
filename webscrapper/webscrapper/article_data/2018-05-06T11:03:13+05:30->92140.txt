 and   Alex Orbison said he cried after watching a   of his late father performing on stage.

 "At that point, that's when I started crying just because of being so proud of what my dad was and now is and always will be I guess - and also because I didn't screw it up," Orbison.
 
 He added, "The profound thing to me was the solidness of the hologram ... this looks like a guy standing on stage."
 
 According to a report, he went on to reveal that the appearance of the hologram was so life-like that it caused an argument between a couple in the audience at a show in Cardiff.
 
 He said, "After the first show there was an argument between a guy and his wife that drew in a crowd of people to try and straighten it out because he felt that we had just had a real person on stage.
 
 "He felt that he had been ripped off, he said 'I thought I was going to see a hologram.'"
 
 However, he explained that the process of putting together the shows did not come without difficulties, saying that the "bar was set high".
