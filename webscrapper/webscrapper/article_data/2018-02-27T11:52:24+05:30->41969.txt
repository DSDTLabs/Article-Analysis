PATNA: CPI (ML) general secretary   Bhattacharya has said his party will mull further ways to unite all Left parties at the ML’s 10th party congress slated to be held from March 23 to 28 at   in  .

 “We will also deliberate on how to strengthen our crusade against fascism and crony capitalism and our struggle for the rights of common people, youth and farmers,” Dipankar told a press conference in Patna on Monday.
 
 Dalit leader and   besides Left leaders from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the UK are also expected to attend the ML meet at Mansa. A rally will be held on March 23, which will be followed by open sessions from March 24 to 28.
 
 Dipankar expressed grief over the death of at least nine schoolchildren after a BJP leader allegedly hit them with his SUV in Muzaffarpur on Saturday. “Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has always used schoolchildren for his political propaganda. He made them stand under the sun to form human chains. But he did not fulfil the demand of villagers to construct a school in their village so that their kids would not need to cross the highway to go to school,” the ML leader said.
 
 On the PNB scam, Dipankar said common people’s money is deducted for not maintaining minimum balance in bank accounts, while the likes of   and Mehul Choksi are looting the country of thousands of crores each. “The government may try to make such scams a ground to privatise the banking sector, but we will never let that happen,” he said.
