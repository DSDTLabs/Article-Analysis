SHIMLA: To ensure the equal   of water throughout Shimla town, entire Shimla has been divided into three zones where water would be supplied after every three days. Chief minister   said this while presiding over the second meeting in a day to review the arrangements for providing adequate water to the residents of Shimla. 

 On Tuesday, water would be supplied in two shifts in Kasumpati, Panthaghati, Chhota Shimla, Vikasnagar, Patyog, Kangna Dhar, New Shimla, Khalini and other peripheral areas of these regions. 
 
 In Chhota Shimla, Vikasnagar and Khalini water would be supplied in the evening and in Kasumpti, Panthaghati, Patyog, Kangna Dhar, New Shimla and other peripheral areas of these regions water would be given in the morning.
 
 Similarly, schedule for providing water to other zones has also been fixed. Adequate number of tankers have also been deployed to ensure at least one tanker in each ward of Shimla Municipal Corporation.
 
 Thakur said that tankers would be pressed into service in those areas which were worst affected by the water scarcity. Besides, management of irrigation needs being fulfilled from Giri and Gumma rivers have also been rationalized which might result in a increase to the tune of 2-3 MLDs by Tuesday. 
 
 He said that water distribution should be regulated effectively and a foolproof mechanism should be evolved for equal distribution of water through tankers so that people do not face inconvenience for getting the water. He said that four control rooms have also been established in Municipal Corporation for smooth supply of water.
