CHENNAI: Sixteen   companies which bid for 1,500MW in TN have accepted Rs 3.47 as tariff per unit. When the price bids were opened on June 30, the lowest bid was from Bengaluru-based   at Rs 3.47 per unit. On Thursday, other companies which had bid at higher tariffs accepted to set up projects at Rs 3.47 per unit.

 “Many companies had bid between Rs 3.47 and Rs 3.97 per unit. We asked other solar   to match the lowest tariff and on Thursday 15 companies, apart from Raasi Green, accepted the request,” said a senior Tangedco official.
 
 NLC alone had bid for the entire capacity for the year 2017-18 at Rs 3.97 per unit. “But on June 30 itself, after the price bids were opened, NLC offered to carry out the project at Raasi’s rate. Other companies also came around later. We have given clearance for 1,500MW to 16 companies,” said the official.
 
 As per the final list made available to TOI, NLC has got 700MW. “Five companies have been allocated 100MW each and the remaining capacity has been given to other companies. M/s Sunlight and M/s Dev International were allotted 1MW each. M/s Dynamize Solar was allotted 5MW,” said the official.
 
 GRT Thanga Maligai group has been accorded clearance for 30MW.
 
 “Companies which have been allocated 100MW or less will have to complete their projects this financial year,” said the official. Companies which have been allocated more than 100MW each will be given two year time for installation, he said.
 
 Tamil Nadu has so far commissioned 1,600MW of solar power projects. About 800MW is being evacuated during peak time, the official said.
 
 “Since there are many tariffs for solar power producers, we evacuate cheap power first, and go on to buy power from costlier sources only when the demand is high,” the official said.
