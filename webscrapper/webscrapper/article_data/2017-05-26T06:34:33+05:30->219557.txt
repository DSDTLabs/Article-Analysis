KOCHI: The student, who complained that  's former principal P Lekshmi   had abused him by calling caste name, has withdrawn his case.

 Vivek, a fourth year LLB student of the law college, had alleged in his complaint that he was ridiculed by the principal while he was standing in front of the principal's office, along with four friends on January 21 last year.
 
 Based on the complaint, police had filed an   under provisions of Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Later, police had informed the high court that the allegation was found to be prima facie true during the investigation.
 
 Seeking a court directive to transfer the case to a senior police officer,   had alleged in the petition to the high court that he was questioned by the investigating officer twice, but the accu sed was not even questioned once. There is a move to scuttle the investigation and a probe by a senior officer is required, he had said.
 
 However, when the case came up for hearing on Thursday, Vivek's counsel informed the court that his client's disputes with Nair have been settled and he does not intend to press the matter, any further. The petitioner's demand was that Nair should be removed from the post of the principal and as she had demitted the post, he intends to withdraw the case.
 
 At this stage, Nair's counsel demanded that the FIR registered against his client and further proceedings should be quashed in view of the fact that the complainant does not intend to proceed with the matter. However, the court said such a demand cannot be allowed on the present petition and issued an order to file an amended petition. The case is now posted for further hearing on Friday.
