BATHINDA: The chief of the special task force (STF) formed to tackle drug trade in Punjab, additional director general of police (ADGP) Harpreet Singh  , held a meeting with police officers of three districts under   range on Friday, directing them to adopt zero tolerance towards drug peddlers. Among those who attended the meeting were officers of Bathinda, Mansa and Muktsar districts.

 Sidhu asked the police officers not to spare anyone in drug peddling irrespective of their stature or influence. He said the authorities concerned had been asked to speed up the process for attachment of the properties of drug lords. “The state government has given the STF a specific target and we are going to wipe out the drug menace from the society in a timely manner. For that, directions have been given to authorities concerned to speed up the process of attaching the properties of the guilty to send out a message to all those involved in this illegal trade,” he told the officers.
 
 Talking to media later,   said, “Police have been instructed to work on three factors of prevention, enforcement and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Anyone who is found spoiling the society through drugs is the enemy of police and we are here to catch him.”
 
 He added that STF was a supporting body as the district police had to catch the culprits and they had to provide logistics and unearth the modus operandi of drug rackets operated in Punjab or outside. He, however, declined to elaborate on the arrests made so far under the anti-drug campaign.
