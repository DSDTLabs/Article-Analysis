HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akther of the Hyderabad High Court sought to know the stand of Enforcement Directorate (ED) on a plea filed by India Cements chairman N Srinivasan, seeking exemption from court appearances in YS   disproportionate assets case. Former BCCI president   is facing charges of money laundering in the India Cements episode of   assets case. 

 Appearing for Srinivasan, senior counsel T   told the court that the cement company chief has to monitor other affairs pertaining to various other companies and efforts. His lawyer would represent him at the trial court, he said. The counsel said an exemption to the septuagenarian from regular court appearances would not affect the progress of the case in any way. 
 
  
 The counsel said the basis for the ED case is a CBI chargesheet in the case and the High Court had already quashed the CBI case against Srinivasan in this case. Refuting these claims, ED counsel K Manmadha Rao told the court though ED depends on CBI case for the main offence, but later it proceeds entirely on a different course. "Our job is to track the laundering of the proceeds of crime and we are on the job," ED counsel K Manmadha Rao said.
 
 The judge sought to know from the ED counsel whether such pleas are maintainable before a sessions judge court. The judge posted the case to February 27 for further hearing.
