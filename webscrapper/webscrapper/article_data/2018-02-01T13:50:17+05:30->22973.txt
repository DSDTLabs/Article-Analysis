 All the sculptures are more than 10 feet in height and depict a story either of Surat, Indian history or Indian contemporary and abstract art form. 
 
 As a recognition for their work, all foreign sculptures would be paid an honorarium of Rs 2 lakh and Indian sculptures would be given Rs 1 lakh for their work. “We can’t pay an artist. It is just an honorarium to recognize their work,” deputy commissioner, SMC, Rajesh Pandya said. 
 
 Municipal commissioner   said, “This is a part of the project to beautify the city. These sculptures would provide an area milestone where they would be placed. More so, it would help Surtis develop a taste for art.”
 
 Recently, SMC had got 10 murals made of iron waste and scrap displayed at different spots in the city. A senior SMC official said Surat has been lacking in sense of artistic developmental aspects. Now, when city is on its way to become a metro, it is time to turn attention to aesthetic developmental aspects of the city.
