PUNE: An   and his two accomplices allegedly assaulted and robbed a 25-year-old   of cash and his   on B T Kawade Road in the early hours of Saturday.

 The victim  , a resident of Gurudatta Colony in Bhekrainagar, sustained minor cuts on his hand while resisting the robbers, B S Dhavale, assistant inspector of the Mundhwa police, said. The police have booked the trio under section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Dhavale told TOI that in the early hours of Saturday, Mandavkar returned from Mumbai by train and walked out of Pune station to take an autorickshaw to go home. “After waiting for about 15 minutes, an autorickshaw driver agreed to take him. Two passengers were already sitting in the vehicle,” Dhavale said.
 
 After travelling some distance, one of the passengers asked the driver to go via Kawade Road as he had some work there. “When the vehicle reached near Kalashankarnagar in Ghorpadi, one of the passengers threatened Mandavkar with a knife and ordered him to handover his valuables to him,” Dhavale said.
 
 Another suspect held Mandavkar’s hands and snatched Rs 1,100 and his cell phone worth Rs 8,000. “The duo then threw Mandavkar out of the autorickshaw. He raised an alarm, following which the suspects fled the spot,” Dhavale said.
 
 Manhunt for suspects
 
 Dhavale said, Mandavkar was unable to notice the registration number of the autorickshaw. The CCTV cameras in the area too proved useless in identifying the vehicle. “He, however, gave us the description of the suspects and told us the firing of the autorickshaw was different than others,” Dhavale said.
 
 The police are now trying to track the suspects and are checking autorickshaws with peculiar firing near Pune Railway station. “We will soon nab them,” Dhavale said.
