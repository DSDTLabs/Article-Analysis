THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health minister   has urged private hospital nurses to withdraw from the indefinite strike called from Monday after the high court directed the government to impose ESMA (Essential Services Maintenance Act) against the striking nurses. The minister warned that the government will be forced to act based on the court order.

 Administrative reforms commission chairman  , meanwhile, came to the aid of the nurses and said that the government should ensure the implementation of the minimum wages as suggested by the SC-appointed committee. Had the private hospital managements implemented the minimum wages in accordance with the committee's recommendations, the nurses would not have gone for the strike, he said.
 
  leader   has sought the intervention of the chief minister to resolve the issue. The government should try to avoid imposing ESMA by calling both the hospital managements and the nurses for discussions, he added.
