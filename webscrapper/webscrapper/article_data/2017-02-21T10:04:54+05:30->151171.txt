INDORE: In the sensational   murder trial, the high court on Monday gave the victim’s father liberty to move the application seeking to increase charges against the accused before the trial court where the charge sheet has now been filed by the police. With this order, the petition which was filed by Shilpu’s father,   Bhadoriya, was withdrawn by him.

 Justice Ved Prakash Sharma passed this judgment in the petition filed by advocate   on behalf of Shilpu’s father. The petition had been filed seeking to book the three accused Shailendra Saraswat, Ashutosh Johare and Neeraj Dandotiya for Shilpu’s rape and murder.
 
 “In the trial going on at the session court, the prosecution will present its witnesses on the next date of hearing which has been fixed for March 3, 2017. We will move the application to book the accused for rape before the sessions court now,” Mohan Singh Chandel, Bhadoriya’s lawyer said.
 
 The petition at the high court had been moved on September 7, 2016, a month after the death of 23-year old private firm employee   Bhadoriya, who had died after falling from the balcony of the fourth floor of   hotel. The police had arrested Shilpu’s boyfriend Ashutosh Johare along with Neeraj Dandotiya and Shailendra Saraswat, who were present in the room with Shilpu when the incident occurred.
 
 The police had earlier booked the three for abetment to suicide as the possibility of suicide was being considered by the police. However, in the charge sheet which was filed before the trial court by the police on February 11, the police charged the three with murder, causing disappearance of evidence of offence and giving false information.
