Nashik: Four years after it was originally proposed to be set up a   at an unused school in the premises of Gadge Maharaj Dharamshala, the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( ) has identified a new location for the home for the destitute. 

 Civic chief Abhishek Krishna said the local corporator and residents had opposed the setting up of the night shelter at the school and they could not go ahead with the original proposal. “We will have to construct a shelter and it is also mentioned in the development plan,” he said.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner Rohidas Dorkulkar, who is in-charge of the project, said that as per the guidelines it has to be a shelter for the homeless instead of only a night shelter. “We have already submitted development project report for a shelter at Pushtadham on Aurangabad Road, Panchavati, a fortnight back. The state government and the general body have approved it. The state government will give us 40% funds in advance and 60% on the completion of work,” he said. 
 
 He added they will have to find out the destitute and allot places to them. “Different dormitories will be made for men, women and the disabled. All amenities like community kitchen, bath, toilet and independent rooms for families will be provided,” said Dorkulkar. 
 
 In the meantime, the temporary night shelter at an unused hall below Gadge Maharaj Bridge is being managed by NGO Manav Utthan Manch from January 10. 
 
 “We have been able to shift 20 people to the shelter and are looking for more. We are also trying to have full time security and make a partition for men and women. At present, NMC security takes two rounds of the place,” said Jagbir Singh of the NGO said. 
 
 In 2013, the NMC planned to convert the school at Gadge Maharaj Dharamshala in Panchavati into a night shelter but it failed to materialise.
