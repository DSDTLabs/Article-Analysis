MUMBAI: Almost two years after being accused of killing her alleged married  , a sessions court on Friday framed charges against hotel receptionist   (27) for  , destruction of evidence and common intention under Indian Penal Code sections. The court also framed charges against alleged accomplice Sukhpal Singh. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges. “Perusal record prima facie case is made by prosecution,” said Judge V S Padalkar. 

 This will now pave way for the trial to commence in the case. Last month, the court has rejected Pascal’s plea for discharge in the case. The matter will now come up for hearing on May 28.
 
 It is the prosecution’s case that Pascal had killed   Tilakraj Rajput (43) after he forbade her from ending their five-year affair. On the intervening night of August 25-26, 2016, a beat marshal from   police station found Rajput in his car on SV Road. He was taken to Cooper Hospital where doctors declared him dead. The victim’s call records led the cops to Pascal. Police alleged the couple got into a fight as Rajput was pestering her to continue their relationship. They claimed Rajput was drunk and the couple drove around the western suburbs. However, the verbal feud turned violent and they assaulted each other before Pascal used her dupatta to strangle the drunken man.
 
 In February last year, the court had granted bail to Pascal. Singh, arrested for destruction of evidence, was granted bail in 2016.
 
 During the bail hearing, the prosecution had submitted that though the investigation discloses that there is no direct evidence, the circumstances on record clearly pointed out to the involvement of the accused. It added that the probe discloses that there was a love affair between Pascal and Rajput and her fingerprints on the vehicle shows her presence at the spot. The prosecution also claimed that call data records showed the connection between Pascal with the commission of the offence.
