GHAZIABAD: Twelve people have been arrested for extorting money from auto-rickshaw drivers in the city. Moreover, police identified six persons including a retired traffic sub-inspector,  , as the ring leaders of these extortion gangs operating from various parts of the city. Cops are on the lookout for them.

 The city police recently distributed pamphlets among   asking them to follow traffic rules as well as report problems concerning their jobs.
 
 Police said they have subsequently received numerous complaints from auto-rickshaw drivers about the extortion by some strongmen for “allowing” them to ply on city roads. “A refusal to bend to their wills meant beating and harassment by their goons. Acting on the complaints, a concerted drive was conducted in the city on Monday and 12 persons were caught red-handed extorting money from auto rickshaw drivers,” SSP Vaibhav Krishna said.
 
 Auto-rickshaw drivers told the SSP that on daily basis they were forced pay Rs 20 at the beginning of the day, besides Rs 20-25 for each trip.
 
 “Altogether, a rickshaw driver was coughing up Rs 200-Rs 250 per day to goons for carrying out their legitimate business. This malpractice, in turn, forced them to take a risk and overload their vehicles and conduct as many trips as possible to compensate for the losses. The drive will continue in coming days and we hope to arrest more people,” the SSP added. 
 
 The drive was conducted at four autorickshaw stands under the supervision of CO (Sahibabad) RK Mishra. The spots are Mahrajpur border,   border,   and Old bus stand. All the 12 have been booked under section 384 (extortion) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC.
