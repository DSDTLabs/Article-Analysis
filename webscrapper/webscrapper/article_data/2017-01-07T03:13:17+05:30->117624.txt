NEW DELHI: The   on Friday approved a ‘good Samaritan policy’ under which anyone extending help to an accident victim will be awarded Rs 2,000 and a certificate of appreciation.

 As per government data, 8,085 accidents had taken place in the capital in 2015.
 
 Announcing the policy, deputy chief minister   said the scheme was intended to encourage people to take accident victims in emergency situation to hospitals so that someone’s life could be saved.
 
 The government had mooted a proposal in August last year after an accident victim bled to death in west Delhi’s   because no one helped him. Sisodia said people were unwilling to help mainly because they were scared that they would land in trouble or be harassed. In some cases, doctors say a victim could have been saved if he or she were brought to hospital on time. 
 
 In April last year, the   government had decided to provide basic life support training to all auto-rickshaw drivers in the city so that they can help accident victims.
