GANDHINAGAR: Shankersinh Vaghela,   and former leader of the opposition in   — who quit the Congress recently — is likely to announce his formal association with the   on Tuesday. The forum was launched by his supporters, with hoardings and an online media campaign. Vaghela is also likely to announce the launch of a political forum akin to the third front on Dussehra (September 30). Though Jan Vikalp has claimed to be against both the BJP and the Congress, considering Vaghela’s open support to the BJP in the Rajya Sabha and Presidential elections, the forum and the third front may end up advantaging the BJP and damaging the prospects of the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections. 

 Eleven MLAs who support Vaghela have joined the BJP and his son Mahendrasinh Vaghela and another former MLA are set to join the party during Navratri. “People associated with the Jan Vikalp were insistent in seeking my support, so I decided to support them,” Vaghela said. “There will be several major political programmes in the coming days, which I will declare on Tuesday.”
 
 The Jan Vikalp campaign states that people want to have options other than the BJP and the Congress in the state. A line in the campaign asks: “Why should the BJP or the Congress be the only options?” The Jan Vikalp website says that over the past 70 years neither the BJP nor the Congress has given “anything except atrocities, exploitation, poverty, fear, hunger and corruption.” 
 
 The campaign promises solve problems that the industry and traders are facing because of the GST. It also assures freedom from costly education and freedom from costly health services. The plank also includes giving employment, reviving small-scale industries, and solving grievances of fixed-pay and Asha workers. All these issues were raised by Vaghela on his birthday in July after he left the Congress.
