ALLAHABAD: While most of the city was done with   by Monday evening, and even the enthusiastic ones had packed their pichkaris and put away their leftover colours by Tuesday, those of Thatheri Bazar locality and Naini bazar played Holi on Wednesday. 

 Be they traders, shopkeepers or employees of government or private firms, people came out on streets with a predominance of colours as traditionally Holi is played in these localities on the third day of the festival. 
 
 In fact, people from other localities also visited their acquaintances in  ,   and Naini. With faces smeared with a myriad of colours, they wished each other. Interestingly, this year people used herbal colours more. People were seen relishing sweets, namkins and traditional khoya products as well as thandai. Organisers had made special arrangements to drench the outsiders. Although Holi is played only in a narrow lane of this locality of Chowk, locals had made arrangement of a tanker and a specially designed shower to drench people. These two localities are located in busy business areas but Holi is restricted to the by-lane, so as not to disturb the adjoining areas.
