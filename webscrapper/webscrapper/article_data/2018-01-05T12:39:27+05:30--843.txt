VISAKHAPATNAM: The   in the city would be extensively modernised at a budget of Rs 40 crore, human resources development minister   said while addressing a large gathering at the   during the fifth phase of the Janmabhoomi programme on Thursday.

 The modernisation proposals of the existing fishing harbour in the city were gathering momentum as the departments concerned had sent a detailed project report (DPR) to the shipping ministry.
 
 According to sources, Cyclone Hudhud had damaged several facilities at the fishing harbour. For modernisation of the harbour, the   (MPEDA) had prepared a DPR to create facilities such as export cubicles, drainages, roads and jetties. The Rs 40 crore project would be taken up by the Central and state governments on a 50-50 sharing basis, officials said.
 
 Though there is vast scope for developing the seafood business, especially exports, the lack of facilities and infrastructure is dogging the harbour, said V Danayya, a fisherman. Unhygienic conditions due to poor sanitation, and lack of proper streetlights is taking a toll on exports, it was felt.
 
 Fisheries department joint director told TOI that the DPR was already sent to the shipping ministry for inclusion under the Sagarmala project. The modernisation of the harbour would be at a cost of Rs 40 crore, of which proposals worth Rs 20 crore are under the Sagarmala project or Trade for Infrastructure Scheme.
 
 The fishing harbour was commissioned for operations in 1976 on an area of 26 acres of land with 11 jetties. Around 200 boats with motors started their operations and the number of the mechanised boats increased to around 700 now.
