INDORE: Comparatively  ,   and advanced cleaning mechanism for streets have made Indore's air more breathable and livable. Air pollutants in   city have dropped by over 15 per cent in 2017 as against a year ago, thanks to cleanliness drive initiated as part of Swachh Bharat Mission that kept streets much cleaner, according to Regional Pollution Control Board. 

 Data from the board showed that air pollutants particulate matter 2.5 and particulate matter 10 dropped in the commercial, residential and industrial areas of the city. 
 
 Dr DK Waghela, chief chemist and lab head at the regional pollution control board said, "The study of air pollutants in 2017 revealed a drop in air pollution in the city. The major reason for the drop in air pollution is that roads are much cleaner these days unlike before and garbage is also disposed of responsibly at the disposal site rather than anywhere at the corner of the street."
 
 Experts said that the main causes of air pollution in the city are dust, emission from vehicles, burning of garbage and construction and demolition sites. 
 
 Highest drop in pollution levels were seen in the residential areas where levels of air pollutants dropped by over 16 per cent followed by Sanwer road, the data showed. These data were collected from the three manual air pollution monitoring stations at Sanwer road, Kothari market and Vijay Nagar. 
 
 The board has set its first continuous ambient   monitoring station at polo ground which tracks and displays the leading air pollutants in the air live round the clock. 
 
 Waghela said, "For more accurate study of air pollution in the city we are soon going to install another live monitoring station at Regal square that will be followed by another installation at Khandwa road."
