CHANDRAPUR: The citizens here were in for a pleasant surprise on Sunday when Prime Minister   made a proud mention of the five tribal ashram school students conquering the Mount   in his Mann ki Baat programme.

 The students, four boys and a girl, were part of a 10-student team sent to scale the highest mountain in the world under ‘Mission Shourya’. It was a joint initiative of Chandrapur collectorate and tribal development department, under which 50 students were shortlisted from three tribal ashram schools in the district. These students underwent extensive training at different institutions and top 10 were selected for the mission.
 
 The PM took pride in mentioning the names of Manisha Dhurve, Parmesh Aale, Kavidas Katemode, Umakant Madavi and Vikas Soyam as brave tribal students from Chandrapur who scaled the Everest on May 16. He said, “Mount Everest has been throwing a challenge to the mankind for centuries and the bravehearts have been responding to it.”
 
 The PM detailed how the students began training since August 2017 and underwent extensive mountaineering preparations at Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh etc before being dispatched on the ultimate mission. “They (students) stood up to the name of mission and bravely scaled the Mount Everest to bring glory to the nation. He congratulated the students and those who took efforts for the success of the mission.
 
 State finance minister and guardian minister of Chandrapur, Sudhir Mungantiwar, thanked prime minister for acknowledging the Chandrapur students’ feat in his address to the nation. The students are on their way back home and are likely to meet   at Delhi before returning to Chandrapur. It is second instance when PM Modi has mentioned Chandrapur in the Mann ki Baat. Earlier, the extensive fort cleaning drive of NGO Eco-Pro had found a mention in PM Modi’s Mann ki Baat.
