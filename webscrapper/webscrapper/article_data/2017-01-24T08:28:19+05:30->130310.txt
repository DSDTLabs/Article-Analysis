NOIDA: The Rs 60-crore   near   in Sector 60 will keep you waiting at least six more months before you can hope to get a signal-free ride. 

 It was supposed to be inaugurated by December 2016, but now it appears the facility will be readied only by June 2017. However, to provide relief to commuters, a new diversion on the road is slated to open in the next fortnight, while the existing diversion will be removed by March this year.
 
 Once complete, the 650m-long flyover with three lanes on each carriageway,is expected to provide signal-free connectivity between Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.
 
 According to  , work on the facility is currently about 65% complete. “We faced a delay of about a month, when the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stopped all construction work to rein in air pollution post Diwali,” said P K Garg, project engineer, Noida Authority. “Other hindrances being faced include the under-construction Metro track extention between City Center in Sector 32 and Sector 62, near NH-24. A Ganga Jal water line also had to be shifted from the area, causing further deferment,” he explained.
 
 Garg further told TOI that as the viaduct for the Metro line has to be raised, the underpass project is unlikely to be completed before June 2017. “To reduce congestion, we plan to remove the diversion near Mamura crossing,” Garg said. “This barricading at the centre of Mamura Chowk has added to the commuters’ woes but will be removed within the next 15-20 days. To further smooth traffic in the area, we will allow traffic to move in all four directions at the crossing by March,” he promised.
 
 Once everything is in place, commute on the 15-km route from Ashram in Delhi via Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway, Atta underpass and towards Chijarsi link to NH-24 will be a breeze. Along with this, a 6.5km elevated road, starting from Sector 28 and ending at Sector 61 near Uflex intersection, is already under construction.
