CHENNAI: Newly-appointed   skipper   is confident that his team is "well prepared" to take on rivals Karnataka in their opening match of the   at the   on Saturday.

 It was Tamil Nadu who had defeated Karnataka in the quarter-finals of the Ranji Trophy last month. Vijay said that there is no pressure on his team ahead of the key clash.
 
 "There is no pressure as such on us. The side is playing good cricket. We are not thinking about the opposition. Anything can happen in T20s. It's about adapting to different situations. We just want to enjoy our cricket and that's what we did against Karnataka when we played the quarterfinals," Vijay said.
 
 Talking about the preparations, Vijay said: "We have been preparing well. Though we couldn't play a couple of practice games, which we wanted to, before the tournament, I think we had two or three quality practice sessions. I feel it will help us adapt quickly to the format."
 
 Tamil Nadu have in the ranks a lot of allrounders such as veteran R Sathish, S  , R  ,   and the skipper himself a medium-pace allrounder.
 
 Vijay felt that he has a lot of bowling options to rotate during the middle and death overs. "We have a lot of allrounders in the side. It's important to rotate them well in the middle phase. We have a few quality spinners such as   and M Ashwin. We have options and anyone can come in and deliver when needed," he added.
 
 The 26-year-old allrounder, who was named in the India A squad for the warm-up match against Bangladesh starting February 5, mentioned that he has been working on improving his bowling.
 
 "I worked on the release (wrist position) in the four-day format. It helped me during the Ranji semifinals as I was able to move the ball. This is completely different format and I have to adapt quickly as a bowler and give the best for my team," he added.
