NEW DELHI:   Bar Association president Vikas Singh on Wednesday condemned the allegations levelled by lawyer   against Chief Justice Dipak Misra in the medical scam case and demanded initiation of criminal contempt against him. 

 A day after Bhushan said he had sent a complaint to the five seniormost judges after the CJI, Singh pointed out "certain factual inaccuracies" in the complaint by way of a letter to the same judges.
 
 "The entire complaint revolves on this falsehood that if the facts were to be put in perspective, there could be no question of any wrongdoing in the matter and the complaint by   and Reforms (CJAR) is an attempt to scandalise the judiciary and hence the complainant needs to be charged with criminal contempt," Singh's letter addressed to Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur, Kurian Joseph and A K Sikri said.
 
 Sent in his personal capacity as a senior advocate, Singh's letter underlined that he appeared for the   in the   matter, adding that he was "quite confident that there was no wrongdoing by the Supreme Court while dealing with the said matter".
 
 Referring to the proceedings of September 18 - CJAR has questioned if the order that day was dictated in open court or was kept pending and dictated later following CBI raids - Singh clarified that "on that date, there were in all 10 matters of medical colleges listed before the court presided over by the CJI and in five matters, similar orders were passed denying permission to the college for the current year and directing that the college could be considered for the next year and also the order in all the cases were dictated in open court". 
 
 He said CJAR's insinuation that the order may have been changed later was "a direct assault to cast serious aspersions not only on the CJI but also on members of the bench, Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, who heard the matters along with the CJI on September 18".
 
 The senior advocate slammed CJAR and said the alleged conversations between middlemen could not in any manner "attribute any wrongdoing on the part of the judges hearing the matter". Singh also annexed details of the five orders passed on the same day as Prasad Education Trust matter with details of case particulars and date on which order was uploaded on the SC website.
