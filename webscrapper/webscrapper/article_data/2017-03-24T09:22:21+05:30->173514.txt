MUMBAI:   status of resident doctors prevailed till late on Thursday despite the   ( ) saying that it had appealed to the 3,400 striking doctors across the state to resume work. The development came after a Bombay HC direction and an appeal from the chief minister.
“It is not clear how many resident doctors will report to work on Friday . MARD had not called for the strike, it was individual resident doctors who chose to shun dutyin protest against workplace violence,“ a MARD member said.
 
 Termination letters, too, could not deter the striking doctors, who now face the likelihood of cancellation of their registrations and hostel accommodation. Earlier in the day , the court had directed the state and BMC not to take any punitive action against the resident doctors who have been on mass leave since Monday, if they resumed work immediately . The court also asked the doctors to get back to work as the government had promised to deploy 1,100 armed security personnel in April, with 500 of them in place as early as next week.
 
 In what could worsen services at the already hard-hit public colleges in the city , the Municipal Medical Teachers' Association (MMTA) with its 1,200 strong workforce of professors, associate professors and lecturers, have given the state an ultimatum of 48 hours to fulfil the demands of resident doctors.
