THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Just a fortnight ago, the   said that pensions are rightful entitlement and not subsidy thus delinking disbursal of pensions from mandatory possession of Aadhaar, but Kerala’s  , which swears by the working class, has denied pensions to around 3 lakh beneficiaries in the state – bulk of them blue collar workers -- simply because they are yet to seed or link their   card.
 
  
 The CPM and other Left parties have also been vocal in their opposition to Aadhaar, considering it an insidious tool in the service of the surveillance state and Big Data, though the finance department, which disburses the pensions, claimed that it is insisting on Aadhaar due to its efficacy in establishing identity. ``We have come across instances where the same person avails pension from more than one welfare fund board. 
 
 Aadhaar is the only way we can trace unique identification number to find out such persons. Aadhaar is being used as part of ongoing data deduplication process,'' said a senior official with the finance department. Manoj Joshi, principal secretary, finance department confirmed this. ``We need to know how many pensions one person is getting and that is verified using Aadhar,'' he told TOI.
