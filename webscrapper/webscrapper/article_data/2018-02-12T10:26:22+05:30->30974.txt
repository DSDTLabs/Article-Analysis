NEW DELHI: The issue of selection of assistant professors in Delhi University’s   reached the Delhi high court after six teachers filed a writ petition, alleging that the appointment process was a “scam”. 

 The joining of teachers has been put on hold till the court comes out with a verdict. In the petition, the teachers alleged that names of the selected candidates were revealed right after the final round of interviews concluded on September 29, 2017. Usually, the names are kept in a sealed envelope till the executive council meeting.
 
 They added that selected candidates had joined even before the results were declared on the university website or on any other public forum. “This is in violation of the university bylaws and established practice...it is also in contravention with the UGC guidelines, which say that the selected names are to be kept in a sealed cover on the day of the last interview”.
 
 Accepting the writ petition,   directed the university to file an affidavit and also show the criteria adopted for selection. “The university has not revealed shortlisted names or their final score...,” said petitioner Huma Khan.
