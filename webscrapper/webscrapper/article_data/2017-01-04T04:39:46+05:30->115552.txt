MUMBAI: Terraces of   buildings in the city will now be allowed ornamental projections and architectural features, according to a new ‘Crown Policy’ to be introduced by the  .

 For the first time, developers will be permitted to connect their towers with a steel beam to create recreational space for the residents. Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands has a   connecting the rooftops of its three skyscrapers, which has a large infinity pool.
 
 The BMC had received a proposal from Mumbai-based Runwal Group, which sought permission for a “terrace-level projection’’ to connect its three towers at Lokhandwala in Andheri.
 
 The developer plans to create 40,000 sq ft of recreational area with a jogging track connecting the three towers, each 30-storeys high behind Infinity Mall in Andheri (west). “Architects and   have been urging us to allow these features which the current rules don’t,’’ said municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta.
 
 “Connecting terrace on three wings is an excellent idea. However, there is nothing in the development control rules to allow such constructions at present. Necessary changes can be made in the draft development control rules (2034) to allow merit architectural features,’’ he said.
 
 The revision cell preparing the new DC rules did not include these features because of the fear that allowing terrace connectivity having large width may obstruct light and ventilation of the flats below.
 
 The BMC has now decided that terraces can be connected provided measures are taken for light and ventilation, structural and fire safety. “Architects will have to submit complete details about steps taken for safety measures, details about ensuring light and ventilation in writing while putting up such proposals,’’ said the new policy.
 
 The BMC has prohibited any structure on the terrace which can be misused. “This area shall be kept vacant and maintained open to sky and not be allowed for any purpose. The chief fire officer will have to give a no-objection certificate before plans are approved,’’ it said.
