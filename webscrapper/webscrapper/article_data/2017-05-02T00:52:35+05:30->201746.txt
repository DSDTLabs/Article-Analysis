NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court refused on Monday to entertain a PIL filed by real estate developer   Ltd for recovery of Rs 165 crore from Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, saying it could not entertain a plea of a defaulter which had failed to comply with its order to refund money to home buyers.

 A bench of Justices Dipak Misra, M Khanwilkar and M M Shantanagoudar dismissed the plea of Unitech that said recovery of Rs 165 crore would help the company deposit the amount as directed by the court. 
 
 The apex court had directed the company to deposit before it the interest component on the investment by 39 home buyers in its residential project in Gurugram but the company failed to comply with its order. The court had then set a deadline of May 8 for the company to deposit the amount and threatened attachment of the property if it failed to abide by its order. 
 
 Referring to Unitech’s conduct in not complying with its order, the bench said, “We cannot entertain a defaulter’s plea or grant him indulgence. You better move the HC for relief.” 
 
 Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the company, urged the court not to dismiss its plea and told the bench that approaching the HC would delay the matter and it would be difficult for the company to meet the deadline fixed by   to deposit the money. 
 
 The bench, however, refused to entertain the PIL.
