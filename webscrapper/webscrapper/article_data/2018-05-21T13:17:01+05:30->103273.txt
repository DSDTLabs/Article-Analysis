MARGAO: Seven years after the tribes of Goa led an agitation on May 25, 2011 at Balli, demanding fulfillment of their 12 main demands, the United   Associations Alliance (UTAA) says while most of their demands have been met, three still lie unfulfilled.

 The unfulfilled demands include 12% political reservation for Scheduled Tribes in the legislative assembly, declaration of ‘scheduled areas’, and formation of a   (TAC). Significantly, while all three lie in the domain of the central government, the last two pertain to Schedule V of the Constitution. While UTAA’s demand for 12% reservation in the legislative assembly stems from the fact that the tribes constitute 12% of Goa’s population, sources pointed out that the issue lies within the purview of the   which is unlikely to be formed before 2020. 
 
 Speaking to TOI recently, tribal welfare minister Govind Gaude had said that the state would soon write to the Centre seeking relaxation in criteria in the central Acts for declaring predominantly tribal-inhabited hamlets as ‘scheduled areas’. Declaration of such hamlets as scheduled areas facilitates the state to carry out infrastructural development works. As most of such villages are located in forest areas, prevailing rules prohibit any sort of development works like road construction, etc, in these villages. 
 
 “The criteria pertaining to declaration of scheduled areas has turned out to be a hindrance in providing basic infrastructural facilities, including construction of roads, to some villages lying in forest areas. We will now follow up with the Centre to bring in the required amendments to the Central Acts. Effective implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act will then lead to infrastructural development of the scheduled areas as provided in the statute,” Gaude had said.
