HYDERABAD: Fifty percent of litigants in courts do not want speedy justice and fear that such instant justice would defeat their purpose of coming to courts, said Justice   of the  . 

 The senior judge of the HC was addressing a Young Indians (YI) seminar here on Tuesday. Referring to the subject of the seminar that pondered over whether the   was a boon or a burden, the judge said that the legal system has the sanction of 50%of litigants that see delay as a means of solution to their problems. Inaugurating the seminar along with another colleague Justice Challa Kodanda Ram, he said that Indian judiciary has been functioning with less number of judges compared to the West. 
 
 In the west, for every one million people there are 140 judges. Whereas, in India, we have only one judge for every 61,865 people, Justice Ramasubramanian said. In terms of judge, population ratio, they are ten times better than us. Worse still, our Indian courts have less number of judges and half of them are never filled. This is raising the number of pending cases despite the existing judges resolving record number of cases every day, every year, the judge said. However the judge agreed that those genuine people who come to the court seeking instant justice are also suffering on account of the legal delays.
