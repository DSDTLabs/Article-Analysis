AlWAR: The   government on Sunday invited Gujjar leader   for talks at the state’s secretariat on Monday ahead of the threats by Gujjars to revive the agitation for reservation to the community.

 Bainsla has announced a sit-in on Tuesday at   near Bayana in Bharatpur district of the state for their demand of five-per-cent reservation within the Other Backward Class ( ) quota.
 
 The district collector, Bharatpur Sandesh Nayak on Sunday had written a letter inviting Bainsla and the Gujjar leaders to have talks with the group of ministers at Jaipur on Monday at 5.30 pm. Mobile Internet services remained discontinued since Saturday night to prevent rumours. Also section 144 of CrPC has been imposed in the whole Bharatpur district. District SP,   and the collector had already communicated with the Gujjars to comply with high court directions relating to any of their future protests. 
 
 A spokesperson of the Gurjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti,  , however said they have called a meeting at 10 am Monday morning to decide whether to accept or decline the government's invitation for the talks. 
 
 A faction of the community has opposed Bainsla, alleging that he keeps the community people misguided all the time and it has become a ‘habit’ for him to announce the revival of the agitation every summer.
