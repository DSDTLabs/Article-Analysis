GUWAHATI:  , the chairperson of   (SBI) who was in Assam on Thursday, said   will be established in the market by the end of February this year. 

 Bhattacharya, who formally inaugurated an ATM in a tea garden in Morigaon district, said there is around Rs 4 lakh crore money remaining in the system which is expected to come back in one and half months' time. 
 
 "Much of the money that was in system has come back. About Rs 15.44 lakh crore was in the system of which some amount was n the banks. About Rs 13 lakh crore was out the system out of which Rs 9 lakh core is already back. So, there is only Rs 4 lakh crore that will flow back in the system in one and half months' time. Economic activity has picked up and lot of positive things are happening. Full liquidity will be established in the market by the end of February," she told reporters.
 
 Bhattacharya said tea garden workers did not suffer much during the post-demonetization period. "I don't think there was much impact as utmost care was taken. Tea garden workers received wages in cash. Post demonetization, we have sent cash vans to tea estates to meet the cash requirement of tea workers. However, banks also decided to open accounts of tea garden workers. Accordingly, we started opening accounts in tea estates," she added.
 
 The chairperson said this move will bring financial inclusion in the tea estates and this will enable the bank to offer loans.
 
 "Workers used to spend whatever they get. As the money will come into the account of workers now, we will be able to offer them personal loans, housing loans and salary advances. The bank now knows how much a worker gets monthly. This programme is very enabling for the workers," said Bhattacharya.
