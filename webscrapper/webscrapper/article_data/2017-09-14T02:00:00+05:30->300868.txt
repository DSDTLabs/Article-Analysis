PATNA: The district administration has decided to resume the popular   at Gandhi ghat from October 7, Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor said on Wednesday after a meeting with the officials and departments concerned. The aarti had been stopped since the boat tragedy opposite NIT Ghat on Makar Sankranti day.

 Like earlier, the aarti will be done on every Saturdays and Sundays at 6pm. The administration has also decided to decorate the ghat with colourful lights to add to the aura of the event. “There will also be two giant screens to show the aarti,” Kishor said.
 
 Taking into account the safety of the visitors, he instructed the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation Limited (BSTDC) officials to ensure steel barricading on the ghat. A proposal to have police picket near the venue was also discussed. Apart from regular deployment of forces at the ghat, there would be two magistrates, two police officers with 15 additional policemen on the aarti day.
 
 It was also decided to install sufficient number of CCTV cameras with high resolution there. Two divers would be on duty during the event, Kishor said and added that ten life jackets with manpower would be in the control room at the ghat.
 
 No private boat will be allowed to ply in the Ganga on the aarti day, except the one run by BSTDC. Boats plying from Chhapra side will be also not allowed during the Ganga aarti. Kishor said no one would be allowed to move towards Gandhi ghat after 10pm any day.
 
 He instructed the traffic police department to chalk out a plan so that no vehicle is be allowed beyond the Golakpur trijunction on the aarti day. He also formed a six-member Ganga aarti managing committee consisting of additional district magistrate (disaster management), SP, traffic SP, PESU assistant engineer, a Patna Municipal Corporation official and a representative of the agency selected for organizing the aarti.
