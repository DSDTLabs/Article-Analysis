 Cosplayer Sameer Bundela from Mumbai, who was dressed as Malavestros from Court Of The Dead, won the Fan Favourite Award, thanks to maximum online votes.
 Though there was only one winner, the effort put in by all the finalists was quite visible. Pracheta Banerjee, who came as Death Prophet from Dota 2, told us, "It took me five-six months to make this costume when I was preparing for the Mumbai Comic Con. It takes me about four hours to get ready. I am an artist professionally, and cosplaying is my hobby. These costumes are quite heavy and expensive. This one cost me over Rs. 40,000, and is made of foam, latex, rexine and worbla, which is one of the most expensive materials used in cosplaying. My costume weighs about 15kg."

 Akshay Churi, who was dressed as   from Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn, said "This costume weighs about 40 kg. The toughest part was to harness the wings. The whole weight of the costume is on my back. I had to work out to carry this!" He added, "I chose to be Sinanju despite the size of the costume, because I love the fact that though itâ€™s a negative character, it still has principals, and is better than the hero."

 Even though the cosplayers attempted to keep the costumes lightweight, they were all in the 15-45kg range. Sana Khan, who was channeling Sarah Kerrigan from StarCraft 2, said, "I have made the wings with PVC pipes, paper and bandages to keep the weight in control. Even then, three people are needed to carry it. Travelling with the costume is challenging. I have to dismantle the wings and tape them again every time I perform. They have motors fitted in to fold and unfold them as well." She added, "I knew while making the wings that they will be heavy and difficult to carry, but I am fan of the character, and the discomfort and hassle is a a part of cosplaying."
 Shahbaz Ahmad, who came as Terrorblade from Dota 2, said, "I took me about a month to make the first structure, then and another two months to finish the modifications. It weighs about 40kg and takes me two hours to put on."
