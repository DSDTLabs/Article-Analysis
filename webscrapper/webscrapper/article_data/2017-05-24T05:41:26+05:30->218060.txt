LUCKNOW:   in most parts of   might make you want to zoom your vehicle in  . But in  , a ride on roads in other parts of the city will wear you down and strain your back. 

 A reality check by TOI of the condition of roads and   in several areas of the city on Tuesday showed that roads in and around Gomtinagar were better than those in the rest of the city. 
 
 Resident of Vikrant Khand Saurabh Singh said, “The roads here are generally good and are maintained on a regular basis which is a great sign.”
 
 Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has imposed an internal deadline on itself to make Lucknow free of potholes by May 30, as against the promise by chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi to do so the same by June 15 across the state. However, chances of LMC meeting its self-declared deadline seem to be bleak.
 
 Meanwhile, the well-maintained roads do not extend to Gomtinagar Extension, where potholes are aplenty repair work is incomplete. 
 
 Roads in localities of Indiranagar, Hazratganj, Faizabad Road, Mahanagar and the Old City are a picture of negligence. 
 
 Ghazi Kidwai, a student in Bhootnath, said, “These roads are not built to last. They are built overnight and last for only a month. It makes these areas prone to numerous accidents.” 
 
 Monsoon makes matters worse in these areas and travelling on two-wheelers becomes difficult. 
 
 Yashi Chaturvedi of Narhi, said, “They construct and reconstruct only the main roads, rarely paying any attention to the interiors. Only areas which have residents of government officials are given importance.”
