CHANDIGARH: Punjabâ€™s state election commission on Friday told the Punjab and   high court that proposal to hold the panchayat elections through electronic voting machines (EVMs) was under active consideration.

 While stating this, the commission said there are around 13,200 gram panchayats and around 1,27,000 EVMs would be required for conducted panchayat elections in the state on a single day. The court was told that the task would be gigantic but the issue was under their active consideration.
 
 The matter is pending before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by agriculture master   and three other staff member of the government senior secondary school at   in  .
 
 The petitioners have demanded that voting in forthcoming panchayat elections, which are likely to be held in July, 2018, should be conducted through EVMs instead of ballot papers, and counting of votes should be done at block level, instead of conducting counting in the concerned villages.
 
 The petitioners have stated that voting through ballot papers leads to large number of disputes and filing of election petitions, arising out of situations when a voter marks the sign between two election symbols, and at the time of counting of votes, the rival candidates claim the vote to have been cast in their favour.
 
 It has also been contended that huge expenses are made by the state government for making arrangements for counting in every village.
