 This is D Imman’s 100th album and the man has left no stone unturned to ensure it sounds zesty, peppy and yet, retains his mark of melody. The album opens with the title track, which has everything going for it — powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics and a foot-tapping orchestration. With tik tik tik constantly echoing in the background,   and Sunitha Sarathy deliver their punch with a lot of intensity. Add to that Yogi B’s stylish rap and what you have in hand is a formidable number like this.   has once again given us newer Tamil words to mull on — Evvathin nudhigaana yaatru maedhum evvaaru ingae pizhai, pavvathin thulimondu maaganjeyyaadhu vvaanil engae mazhai is just a sample.
 
  Imman follows this up with a beautiful melody,  , a new-age lullaby. The song has a father’s version and a mother’s version, and both are genuinely different, with varying soundscapes and even portions of lyrics, not just the voices. The Father’s Love is sung by Sid Sriram and is more classically inclined, with violin synth strings merging beautifully with intermittent whistling. Mirthula Siva is pitch-perfect in the Mother’s Love version and her fresh voice, westernised rendition and synth-heavy background score gives this number a newer sound. A huge shout out to Karky, for, he’s making us fall in love with Tamil all over again. 
 
 Next in line is the inspirational Vinveera, and surprisingly for the genre, the energy level in the track sees a dip.   and Sri Rascol (rap) have rendered the number with all their heart and though it isn’t an ear sore, it somehow doesn’t strike a chord with us. The album has two themes — Race Against Time is crisp, bassy and reflects the mood of the film, while Far Beyond Earth is a little longer and slower. There are karaoke versions of both Tik Tik Tik and Kurumba, and with the lead singers’ voices missing, the two serve their purpose well. In short, Imman’s composition for this space film is quite out of the world.
