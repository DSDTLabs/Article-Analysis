 A 75 year woman from Tanzania complained of chest discomfort. She underwent a coronary angiography showing 80-90% blocks in all three major arteries of the heart. She had been advised   in Tanzania and   with three stents in Dubai. In India, we decided to do a test called FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) and IFR (Instantaneous wave free ratio). The results were negative, which showed that she did not need anything for her blocks and was treated with medicines. 

 Does every block need treatment? Does it cause symptoms or decreased blood flow to the heart muscle? FFR and IFR are tests which measure pressure across the block with the help of a pressure sensor placed in the heart arteries. The American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology has ranked FFR as Class IA level of indication. It is a gold standard method of treatment for patients with heart disease. Only if there is a drop in pressure, the patient needs angioplasty/ bypass surgery for that block.
 
 Will the patient benefit by doing bypass surgery or angioplasty? Multiple studies like DEFER, FAME, FAME 2, etc. were carried out worldwide. The risk of heart attack was <1% in FFR negative patients treated with medications. FFR guided angioplasty had better outcomes than angiography based procedures. In one study it was seen that of all the patients having blocks in three vessels and referred for bypass surgery, when FFR was performed, only 14% had three vessel disease, 43% had two vessel disease, 34% had single vessel disease and 9% had no disease. So a significant number of patients who were actually advised bypass surgery could be treated by angioplasty or medicines; of course at a reduced cost.
