PATNA: The G V   roundabout, which went up in flames on Saturday, had not procured the mandatory occupancy certificate from the state  .

 Lodipur fire station officer Arvind Prasad said after the completion of the five-storey commercial building, which came up more than five years back, the developer never approached the fire department for the occupancy certificate.
 
 “Fire services department passes map of every building after giving certain safety guidelines to the developers. Once the building construction completes, the developer or the owner is supposed to approach the department for an inspection to get occupancy certificate. However, most of the builders do not abide by the guidelines,” Prasad added.
 
 Prasad, quoting provisions of Bihar Building Bylaws, 2014 and National Building Code of India, 2005, said any building rising above 15 metres height or having built-up area of more than 500 square metres, would have to install fire safety and fire fighting equipment at the time of construction.
 
 “People lack awareness about fire safety measures in a building. Such equipment have proven to be life saver several times. Only few developers of the city approach the fire department for regular inspection,” he said.
 
 “The situation is such that the department has to write letters to developers to procure occupancy certificate,” he added.
 
 Prasad said fire extinguishers require annual replenishment. However, at the G V Mall, they were not replenished since 2013. “It will take two to three days to send report to headquarters on Saturday’s incident,” the officer added.
 
 Surprisingly, a day after the major fire, a shop of a reputed food joint at the mall and a few other shops were thrown open for visitors.
