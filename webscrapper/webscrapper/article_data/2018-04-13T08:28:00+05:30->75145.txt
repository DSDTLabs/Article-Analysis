NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old woman is battling for her life after being stabbed at least a dozen times by a man who owed her Rs 5 lakh she had lent him for investment. The incident happened on Wednesday evening, after the suspect, Anwar, had called her to resolve the monetary dispute and stabbed her during an argument.

 DCP (southeast)   said that Anwar was nabbed on Thursday and has been detained for questioning.
 
 The woman, Neetu Sharma, is a resident of Greater Noida and had met Anwar at a cousin’s wedding. He had claimed to be a share broker and had offered to double her money in a few years. Sharma’s brother Anshu said that she had given Rs 5 lakh to Anwar but did not receive any returns due to which she had several heated arguments with him.
 
 “Anwar had called her for a meeting near the   building in Sarita Vihar. Eyewitnesses have told us that he had suddenly pulled out a knife and stabbed her several times. He fled after he spotted a policeman,” said Anshu.
 
 The policeman had rushed Sharma to Apollo hospital and had also managed to note down the registration number of the scooter on which Anwar had fled. She was identified by the ID cards in her purse.
 
 Family members say that Sharma used to work at a private company in Delhi, but had quit her job one-and-a-half-years ago when she got married to a businessman. “She had trusted Anwar’s scheme since he was known to our cousin,” said Anshu.
 
 Doctors have told her family that Sharma has suffered injuries to her internal organs due to the attack and has been kept under observation. Her statement would be recorded once she regains consciousness.
 
 Meanwhile, the police tracked down Anwar to his house in Jasola and are questioning him regarding the motive of the attack. A case under sections of attempt to murder (307 IPC) has been registered against him.
