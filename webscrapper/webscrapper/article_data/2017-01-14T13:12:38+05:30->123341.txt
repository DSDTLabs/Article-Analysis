With the Mollywood film strike coming to a close, actor  's efforts have been lauded, especially for heading a new organisation of theatre owners,   and distributors that would seek to ensure that theatres would never be closed down again.

 The actor, before the meeting for forming a new organisation, said, "We are forming this association with a good intention. 
 I can guarantee that this organisation will be important because producers, distributors and theatre owners are part of the movie. Federation is an union and I am not someone to create a rift between theatre owners. It's unjust to close theatres for needless arguments. This organisation has been formed to combat such extreme, unwanted measures." 
 
 Dileep stressed that no theatre should be closed down. "Cinema is for the viewers. A lot of people work hard to bring a movie to theatres. So, when they say they won't play it, it affects the ones involved. Theatres should never be shut. This was a time when people welcomed films with arms wide open. So, this decision was unfair. My request is never to shut theatres as a solution for any problem," he said.
 
 On accusations that the actor is bent on creating a split in the   federation, he says, "I can't do anything. It's an accusation, right? I respect a lot of people in the Kerala Film Exhibitors Federation. I am a producer, distributor and a theatre owner. So, I know what goes through the mind of each person involved."
