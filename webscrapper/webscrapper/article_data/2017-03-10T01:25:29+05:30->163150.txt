LUCKNOW/BHOPAL: A former   (IAF) airman was among two persons caught by the UP anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on Thursday in connection with the blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight. Police said Ghouse Mohammad Khan, who served in   for 15 years, was a “hardcore member of the terror module” which was allegedly responsible for the blast on Tuesday.

 While five members of the module radicalised by the so-called Islamic State (IS) have been arrested from UP, three others have been arrested from Madhya Pradesh. Another member of the module, Saifullah, was killed in a house on the outskirts of Lucknow early on Wednesday in a 12-hour operation by ATS commandos. The UP police claimed that with the arrests on Thursday, all members of the module are in its custody.
 
 Describing Khan as a “technical” hand, additional director general of UP police, Daljit Singh Chawdhary, said that he was the “main accused and mastermind”. The second suspect arrested on Thursday, Azhar, was the main supplier of arms in the module.
 
 IG (ATS) Asim Arun said Khan had joined IAF in 1978 and took voluntary retirement as a corporal in 1993. Subsequently, he set up a business in leather goods in Kanpur. Khan’s family stayed in the Maqdoom Nagar colony in Kanpur’s Jajmau locality, which is barely 150 metres from Saifullah’s ancestral house.
