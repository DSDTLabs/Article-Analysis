KANPUR:   in   of   are facing threat as major portions of   are parched, with temperature touching 44 degrees. 

 Wildlife experts and environmentalists claim that around 100 birds have been sighted this year and blame the extreme hot condition that have turned away the state birds from Sarsai Nawar wetland.

 Of the total 1,500 to 2,000, about 100-200 Sarus birds are a regular feature in Sarsai Nawar wetland. But the count has gone down drastically with the rise in temperature in the past few days, said forest officials. 
 
 Environmentalist Rajiv Chauhan said that due to excess heat, the sarus bird count has gone down considerably. Till date, around 100 birds have been sighted in Sarsai Nawar wetland this year. After courtship, which will last till May, these birds will fly back to their territory.
 
 They will start building nests with the onset of rainy season from July. 
 
 "We have started supplying water to Sarsai Nawar wetland through Sarsai Bumba drain. Sarus birds have migrated to nearby areas and we are sure that once again, the birds will start coming at the wetland with the arrangement of water," Etawah divisional forest officer Kanhaiya Patel said.
