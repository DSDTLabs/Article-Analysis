Trichy: V K Divaharan, brother of jailed AIADMK leader V K Sasikala, dropped a bombshell on Wednesday when he claimed that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had passed away on December 4, 2016 itself. However, the administration of Apollo Hospital, where she was treated, announced her death only the next day fearing for the safety of the hospital, he alleged at a public meeting at Mannargudi in Tiruvarur.

 He said, ‘Amma’ had passed away exactly at 5.15 pm on December 4, 2016. Upon getting the information, he had reached the hospital that night itself. “Even then, Amma was being kept on ventilation. When I enquired with Reddy, he asked me to ensure the safety and security of the hospital. Only then could he declare (her death)”, Divaharan claimed. The meeting was organised on the occasion of AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran’s birth centenary celebrations.
 
 On floating a new party, Divaharan said that there was no need for it. “However, until we retrieve the two leaves symbol from the rival group, it is necessary for us to be identified as a separate group, at least for a brief period. Recovering the symbol is our primary aim,” he added.
 
 He said that Makkal Paniyagam, the movement launched by his son Jeyanandh, was not a political party. It was a forum to unite like-minded people to serve the general public and had no electoral ambitions. Divaharan also alleged that food minister R Kamaraj had struck a secret deal with DMK to win the assembly election in Nannilam constituency.
