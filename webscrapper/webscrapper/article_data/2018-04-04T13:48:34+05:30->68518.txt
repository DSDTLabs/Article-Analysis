PANAJI: With the process of creating area-wise   registers across the state picking up pace, the   is being flooded with requests from several village panchayats seeking to record the biodiversity within their respective jurisdictions. 

 The substantial bump in numbers has led to a shortage of technical hands at the state biodiversity board that could assist local self-governing bodies with the process. To bridge the gap, the board has begun engaging more scientific institutes, universities and voluntary organisations that have knowledge of the field. It has also called for expressions of interest from “scientific institutions, universities, registered and reputed NGOs, and community-based organisations having knowledge and experience of bio-resources, biodiversity and related areas for the constitution of technical support groups (TSGs)”.
 
 TSGs are aimed at providing on-field support to biodiversity management committees for the preparation of people’s biodiversity registers and collection of reliable secondary data.
 
 “So far, we have nine technical people with us. One such person can assist a maximum of two panchayats at a time. We have received funds for 75 panchayats and want to start work on biodiversity registers for all these,” the board’s member secretary, Pradip Sarmokadam, said. He also said each panchayat would be allocated Rs 1 lakh. Of this, Rs 75,000 could be utilised by the technical support group and the rest for capacity-building in creating biodiversity registers.
 
 A biodiversity register is essentially a record of bio-wealth and traditional knowledge associated with the biodiversity of a particular region.Only a handful of panchayats had begun the process of creating their own biodiversity registers over the past few years.
