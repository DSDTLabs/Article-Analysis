  Another startling fact from the CAG report was that 96 of the 159 nagarpalikas had no sewerage connections, which meant that waste water from homes were directed into soakpits and open drains, leading to soil and water pollution. None of the nagarpalikas had functional sewerage treatment facilities. 
 
 In Valsad, two sewage treatment plants (STPs) were non-operational, while only five of the eight municipal corporations had sewage treatment facilities, the CAG report notes.

This January, when the CAG sought information on the status of the STP plant, the   (VMC) did not respond.
