MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday questioned the BMC if it would wait for the structural audit report of Lalbaug flyover before carrying out repairs. 

 A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai expressed its displeasure with the BMC affidavit on the issue and asked for a response from the municipal commissioner or a designated officer by Tuesday, when it has scheduled the next hearing of the case. 
 
 The court was hearing a public interest litigation that had referred to reports of cracks being noticed on the bridge. At the last hearing, the court had asked the BMC chief to take a decision on whether a structural audit was necessary before carrying our the planned resurfacing work. 
 
 In an affidavit, the corporation said that a structural audit had been ordered and the report would be submitted on January 31. The court observed that there was no clarity on whether the work would start before that date. 
 
 The 2.48km flyover between ITC Hotel in Parel and Jijamata Udyan in Byculla was inaugurated in June 2011. The flyover eased one of the most congested stretches on the eastern corridor of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Road, between Sion and Byculla. 
 
 The PIL cited the various incidents since the construction of the bridge. In 2010, a cantilever of the under- construction bridge collapsed; a year later, days after the bridge was thrown open, potholes were observed on the bridge surface and in April 2012, a block fell down.
