THRISSUR: This year too,   was plagued by delays but that did not dampen the local support for the event as venues remained jam-packed even at 4am on Tuesday. Though performers were tied down by gruelling and unexpected delays, they were not disappointed by the turn out at the events.

 Sunil Kumar, a teacher from SNMHSS, Ernakulam who rushed out at 10:30pm to get refreshments for his students before their group dance event, said: “The programme was scheduled at 3pm and now it is 10:30pm and the first performance of the event has not begun. It is a surprise that despite the hour and delays, people are still here in large numbers to see the performance though it is a working day tomorrow.” The programme concluded at around 6am on Tuesday morning.
 
 “This is where Thrissur Pooram happens, we are always ready for a festival,” said Saji K, who came here with his family to witness the group dance event. Another Thrissur resident,   said that ever since Kalolsavam began on Saturday, he and his family have been enjoying the performance at various events.
 
 General secretary of   P Krishnakumar said that Kalolsavam, despite its short span, reminded the district of its lost nightlife.
 
 “Thrissur used to have a very vibrant nightlife years ago as people used to gather around   ground in the evening and would only leave the place at night. There would be many events on the ground, people selling food in makeshift stalls and all this would all go on till late into the night. All of this started to disappear with modernizations, new forms of entertainment and the indifference from the police. Only during Kalolsavam people get an opportunity to spend some time outside,” he added.
