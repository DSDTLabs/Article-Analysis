THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP former state president and party national executive member V Muraleedharan on Monday filed his nomination for the March 23 biennial elections for the vacant   seats from Maharashtra, in Mumbai on Monday.

 
 He submitted two sets of nomination papers to Maharashtra legislative assembly secretary Vilas Athvale by 1.30 pm. Maharasthra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra education minister Vinod Tawde, BJP’s Maharashtra state president Rao Saheb Patil, Maharashtra parliamentary affairs minister   and Muraleedharan’s wife   accompanied him.
 
 The candidature of Muraleedharan is seen as part of a larger game plan being spread out by the BJP central leadership in view of the upcoming Chengannur by-election and the general elections that follows in a year. He is also likely to be included in the   cabinet, soon after the election.
 
 
 Meanwhile, LDF independent candidate M P   and UDF candidate B Babuprasad submitted their nominations to Rajya Sabha, from the state. Given the political strength of the UDF and LDF in the state assembly, Veerendrakumar stands the chance to win. The nomination of UDF candidate would only ensure that Veerendrakumar, who recently severed his political links with UDF, doesn’t go unopposed to the upper house.
