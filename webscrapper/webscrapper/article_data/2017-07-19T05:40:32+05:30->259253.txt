KOLKATA: Ever since   and his brother Swarup were arrested on Monday, their family members are having a tough time handling the kids in the household. They are fumbling for words to answer one question raised by them: “Did the two really threaten  ?”

 Shami has a huge fan-following in the Sarkar household. All four kids follow him closely. In fact, Swarup’s son — a Kolkata fan in the IPL — decided to switch loyalty to Delhi after the latter picked up Shami in the auction. “We are trying to tell them that it was a mistake to turn up at Shami’s residence, a very costly mistake,” said  , the brother of Jayanta and Swarup.
 
 Though the family is filled with remorse, they are now squarely blaming the third accused – Mathurapur resident Shiva Pramanik, who initially picked up the argument while Shami was parking his car.
 
 “On Saturday night,Shiva came and told us that he was threatened by a man in a red car. He could not identify Md Shami. Swarup went along with him. He came back and asked Dada (Jayanta) to join him,” said Suman.
 
 But then why did the brothers barge in knowing well that Shami resided there? Suman claimed he had no clue. “Ever since police arrested my two brothers and they were bailed out, we have not been able to speak much,” he said.
 
 According to locals, Swarup had a humble beginning but gradually became a name to reckon with in the locality, flaunting his closeness to a Trinamool councillor. “Swarup leads a group of men whom he would protect to get his job done. Shiva was inducted in his group a couple of months ago. On an earlier occasion, both of them were involved in another incident when Swarup had slapped a trader on Sukantu Setu,” recalled a Trinamool insider. Police officers confirmed that Swarup was indeed under watch for the past few weeks.
 
 “They might be out on bail but we have evidence against them. Key witnesses have been asked to record their statements,” said a police officer.
