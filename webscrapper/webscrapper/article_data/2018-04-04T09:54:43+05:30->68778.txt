AHMEDABAD: It provides anonymity, has no government control and can be used across the world. Investors, post-demonetization, had many reasons to be attracted to   such as bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies provide an avenue for parking large sums of money generated from industries where large cash transactions are common.

 Sunny Vaghela, an Ahmedabad-based cyber security expert, said that investments in cryptocurrencies are conservatively estimated to be worth around Rs 3,000 crore in  . “Cities like Surat and Ahmedabad saw a number of companies involved in initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the last two or three years. These private exchanges offered cryptocurrencies to investors,” he said.
 
 While lots of bona fide investors were attracted to bitcoins due to its exponential growth, many saw an opportunity to rake in the moolah. An industry expert said that many people have also been fleeced by such ‘private exchanges.’ “The exchanges offered good returns with interest offered being as high as 10% per day, for a lock-in period of 180 days. At the end of the period, the investor would have two digital wallets, one with the principal and another with the interest. Investors could see the value of their investment grow, but it was only virtual. Before the six months were over, the exchange operator would wind up the business and flee with the hard cash. A few cases like this have been registered,” said the expert, adding that most investors are not properly acquainted with or even interested in concepts such as blockchain technology.
 
 Has the government of India’s official stance on cryptocurrencies changed the scenario? Experts said investments are currently high, but new entries have slowed. The volume involved, however, will sustain the field for some time, as   is still as good as money for some.
