With absolute majority in the state,   workers were in no mood to let the moment go away that easily throughout Saturday.

 While early in the morning different media crews were flocking to it, by 10am saffron colour pervaded the compound of the office that is located opposite Vidhan Sabha Bhawan in Hazratganj. As trends started pouring in, crowd and noise in the office kept growing.
 
 Having bagged the lion’s share of seats, celebrations continued at the BJP party office in Hazratganj till late evening. “It does not look like it’s Holi on Monday. BJP workers have been playing with gulal and rang. I just want to reach home quickly,” said Avinash Tripathi, a commuter stuck in the mayhem outside the office.
 
 The usual song and dance routine, which relies heavily on dhol, nagade, laddoo, crackers, sloganeering, abeer and gulal, went on. Resident of Rakabganj Kundri, Deepandra Dubey, a young worker, said, “The party got revived after almost two decades due to the Modi factor. And we all have come to celebrate together.” Many, like Dubey who is into grocery business, shut their shops to participate in the festivities.
 
 A party leader arrived with hundreds of balloons stacked together as lotus, the party symbol. The most popular slogans which kept echoing in the office were – ‘Ek Hi Naara Ek Hi Naam, Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram; Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi; Gaye Gaye Gaye Gaye Gaye Akhilesh, Gaye Akhilesh Gaye Akhilesh.”
 
 Unable to control the crowd which wanted to spend time with party workers and click selfies, security guards deployed in the office locked the gate to regulate public entry on the first floor where state president Keshav Prasad Maurya, state in-charge Om Prakash Mathur and Sunil Bansal sat.
 
 For some, the massive victory opened up opportunities. Vendor Ashish, who sells pans inside the office, said, “My business has skyrocketed today. Upbeat with the results, people have been paying extra as tip.”
