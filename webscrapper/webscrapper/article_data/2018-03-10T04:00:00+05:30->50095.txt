This spells good luck for air conditioner companies. Companies such as Blue Star are bullish about their growth hitting 15% this summer. “The weather forecast has predicted a hot summer and good monsoons, which translates into good times for the room air conditioner space,” said B Thiagarajan, joint managing director, Blue Star. “We expect better growth from the tier-3 and tier-4 markets. The company is forecasting a growth of 12.5% this fiscal. Last year was difficult owing to GST uncertainty,” he said. Since the penetration of air conditioners is low at 5%-6%, there is further potential to grow, analysts said. Duggad said that 50% of the growth would come from urban pockets.
