Theeram, starring Pranav Ratheesh in the lead, has three melodies by Afzal Yusuff and a fast number by Sankar Sharma. 

 While some of them are wonderfully crafted, others leave us wishing for more.
 Njaanum Neeyum by Shreya Ghoshal and Quincy Chettupally, the first song, is a mellow romantic track and the singers breeze through the dreamy music by Afzal, wonderfully and confidently. Their velvety vocals also help the duo do an amazing job of executing a track, which is like a romantic fantasy in slow motion.
 
 Bollywood singer Anweshaa steps into Mollywood through this film, singing the duet Minnaminungu with Najim Arshad. Another romantic track by Afzal with a slow flowing tempo, the song is quite captivating. Anweshaa handles the Malayalam lyrics well enough to let the listeners focus on the melody, rather than the words. 
 
 In the third song Njan Varumee Paadhayil Bollywood singer Armaan Malik and Tabitha are behind the mike and it’s yet another beautiful track. Armaan’s rendition reminds one of songs by Udit Narayan in Malayalam. His satin-soft voice does the track a world of good. Listeners might be distracted by the adorably mispronunced words coming up in the song at times, but overall it’s a likable number. 
 
 Poru Nirayum, the last song by Niraj Suresh and Sanoop Kumar, is composed by Sankar Sharma and has lyrics by Siby Padiyara. It’s fast-paced and has a kind of energy to it but the overall product is just passable. You won’t feel like following the flighty tune to its farcical finale.
