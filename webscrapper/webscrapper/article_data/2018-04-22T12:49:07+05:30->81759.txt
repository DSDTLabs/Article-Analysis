CHANDIGARH: Even though   fund under the “poor students’ welfare fund” at   increased by 29%, the number of scholarship applications for the 2017-18 session reduced by one-fourth as compared to last year. While only 134 students will get scholarships, the fund available for financial aid of students is around Rs 24 lakh. 

 “We have increased the scholarship amount by around Rs 7 lakh and want maximum students to avail financial assistance. We will try to cover as many students as possible next year as well. All we want is students to come forward and avail this scholarship,” said dean, student welfare ( ) Prof Emanual Nahar.
 
 This year, the DSW office received 150 applications for the 2017-18 session from hostellers. Of these 150 applications, 134 were found eligible. Of these, 92 belong to families whose annual income is up to Rs 1 lakh and 33 belong to families with an annual income of Rs 2 lakh. There are nine applicants whose family income is up to Rs 3 lakh.
 
 As for the limited number of applications, experts say in many cases, students are not aware of the scholarships available. Also, since scholarships are awarded on the basis of income categories, experts say many students are not eligible for financial assistance under the categories specified. 
 
 Since there are few applicants, out of the Rs 24 lakh meant for scholarships, only Rs 7 lakh will be disbursed. Last year, scholarships worth only Rs 5 lakh were disbursed since there were not many takers. 
 
 A committee constituted by Panjab University vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover, in a meeting held in March, decided that students who require more financial support due to certain circumstances will be considered and given support. The committee has also decided to earmark some amount for such students. 
 
 Under the “poor students’ welfare fund” disbursed by the DSW office, there are three categories eligible for scholarship. These include those with income of up to Rs 1 lakh per annum, income from Rs 1,00,001 to Rs 2 lakh per annum and income from Rs 2,00,001 to Rs 3 lakh per annum. Students whose family income is upto Rs 1 lakh per annum will get an amount of Rs 5,800, those with income between Rs 1,00,001 and Rs 2 lakh per annum will get Rs 5,000 and those with income from Rs 2,00,001 to Rs 3 lakh per annum will get Rs 3,600 per annum.
