BHUBANESWAR: The   (BMC) on Tuesday kicked off the   among people to participate in   ( ) that the Centre will start from Wednesday. 

 The Centre has been doing cleanliness survey from last year to rate cities in terms of maintaining sanitation. The ministry of urban development (MoUD) has developed an app called Swachhta for the people. By using the app, people can post their opinions on the city's cleanliness. The survey will be done in 500 cities across the country. The BMC sources said this year they will start the awareness drive from educational institutions. "We will cover around 50 educational institutions including schools, colleges and universities. Many people, including students, are not aware of how to use the app and post their opinions," said a BMC spokesperson. The BMC will compete with other cities and try for the top rank, he added. 
 
 Official sources said the grievance posting through the app is one of the parameters to judge a city's cleanliness status. The postings in app will give a fair idea to the surveyors as what the people's complaints are and which problem most of the citizens complain about. The MoUD will scan the contents of the app and see how many have downloaded the app in a city. 
 
 Although last year, the smartest city registered top rank for cleanliness in eastern India and received the Swachh Sarvekshan award, it missed out on the top-10 all- India ranking. The survey to identify cleanest city is based on comparative analysis in terms of methods adopted in garbage collection, segregating of garbage and making the roads clean by removing solid waste every morning. The survey also takes into account   observation by a team of surveyors delegated by the Centre.
