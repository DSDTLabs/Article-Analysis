What makes director  's debut film interesting is that the film travels across three different timelines. The film titled,  , stars   and   in the lead roles. Talking about the film, Sathya says, 'The story travels across three   -1980s, 1990s and 2017. The film revolves around friends, who come across a girl of their dreams. What follows forms the crux. We shot the film primarily in Chennai, Ooty, Kadalur, Virudhachalam and Perambalur, among other places. 

 ' Since it involves three timelines, the team was particular about makeup and costumes. 'We didn't want to overdo it. We kept it believable and took pains to get the look right. Both the actors were professional and played their parts well. Sivasenapathy, who is also the producer of the film, plays an important role in the film. We are looking for a summer release,' says the director.
