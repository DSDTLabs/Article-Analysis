 Along with sharing the lovely memories Pt Tayade shared with Pt Bhimsen Joshi, he also presented few of the special Bandish, Abhangs and devotional songs made popular by the maestro. “Pt Bhimsen Joshi enthralled generations of connoisseurs with his renditions of Hindustani classical music. Through his absorption of the soul of various gayaki styles, Panditji created a unique blend with his own introspective sense of presentation. We learned to accept music beyond the Gharana barrios,” said Tayade.
