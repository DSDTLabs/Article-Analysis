 author   is known as much for her feminism and conversational novels as for her conventional approach. And now, 200 years after her death, we come to know about her 'mischievous' side that was hardly known before.
 
 Jane Austen, who never married anyone, created fake entries in a marriage register linking herself with two separate men, reported Bbc.com. Buzz is that   made two fake handwritten entries of her marriage in the record book as a teenager in Hampshire during the late 18th Century. How? Austen had access to the book as her father   was the rector of the parish, according to  .
  
 While not much is known about the fictitious entries, one of them includes an entry for the publication of banns of marriage between Henry Frederic Howard Fitzwilliam of London and Jane Austen of Steventon. The other has the marriage details of Edmund Arthur William Mortimer of Liverpool and Jane Austen of Steventon. But whether Fitzwilliam or Mortimer really existed, is not yet known.
  
 It's noted that in the late 18th century, women married early mainly for financial security. While Austen remained single throughout her life, she made marriage a central subject in many of her books. ‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,’ reads a line in her book 'Pride and Prejudice'.
  
 According to Bbc.com, Hampshire County Council’s culture spokesman Andrew Gibson said, "In the year when we celebrate 200 years since her death, this unique document uncovers another side to Jane Austen’s character... Jane would have been in her teens when she wrote these fake marriage entries, and some could say it reveals a mischievous side during her younger years."
  
 These documents would be displayed as a part of the   exhibition at Winchester’s Discovery Centre in May this year. 2017 also marks 200 years since Austen's death at 41.
