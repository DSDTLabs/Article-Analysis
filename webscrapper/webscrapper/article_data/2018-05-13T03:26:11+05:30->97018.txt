THANE: Residents of Ghodbunder Road and neighbouring areas have been witnessing   since the last couple of days, forcing them to rely on the thriving tanker water. While the administration has been imposing water cuts every week to ensure there is adequate water to last till mid-July, the sudden water crisis which has been imposed in parts of Thane has taken residents by surprise.

 Areas like Kharkar Ali, Mahagiri, Pokhran Road, parts of Ghodbunder Road, to name a few have been facing water crisis for the last few days. A resident of   said that they have been facing water shortage since the last few days and they had to opt for tanker water, which is a costly affair. 
 
 “We had to spend a considerable amount on purchasing water for drinking and non-potable use over the last few days as there was no supply for two consecutive days,” said Vidya Joshi, a resident. The situation at Manpada was no different as residents claimed that water supply was inadequate and they had to rely on tankers.
 
 Sanjeev Datta, a resident of Kharkar Aali in old Thane, said that they have been receiving water for hardly 20 minutes since the last few days. “We do not have water in our home since Wednesday. The supply resumed only on Thursday, but hardly lasted for 20 minutes. Residents of Mahagiri and Koliwada are also facing similar problems. Repeated complaints to the authorities have gone in vain,” Datta said. 
 
 When contacted, officials from the TMC admitted that certain parts of the city faced water cuts since Wednesday due to an emergency shutdown to carry out pre-monsoon work. Over 300mld water coming from STEM and TMC was not available over the last two days, causing problems, said officials. 
 
 “Usually, the shut down is for 12 hours, but we had to undertake a 24-hour closure on Wednesday which is causing scarcity in some areas. The shutdown was to carry out pre-monsoon work. Supply will be normalized in the next few days,” said a TMC official.
