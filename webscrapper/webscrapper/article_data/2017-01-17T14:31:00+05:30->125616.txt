Benny, who was in Kanpur for a concert on Saturday evening, had to fly to Delhi from Lucknow on Sunday morning. "It was only after my concert wrapped up late at night when I found out that the   has been shut down due to a technical snag. We were also informed that the problem could take few more days to be rectified. Since we were not sure when the airport would be operational again, I immediately asked my support staff to hire taxis to Delhi so that we could reach the city by road in time for our concert," says Benny, adding, "We left Kanpur at 4 am, as we did not want to risk missing the concert, which was held on Sunday. The snag did cause us some trouble, but since we had a professional commitment, we all decided to travel by road. We’re happy we didn’t disappoint music lovers in the capital."

  After the cancellation of flights on Saturday afternoon, airport technicians, with the help of Kanpur and Delhi units, were able to make flights operational by Sunday, 12.30am. However, the chaos forced a lot of travellers from Lucknow and Kanpur to make last moment changes in their travel plans. Mohit Agarwal, a software engineer from Lucknow, who was travelling to Delhi, says, "As soon as I came to know about the radar problem, I booked a tatkal railway ticket from Delhi to Lucknow as a backup option. Thankfully, the problem was resolved in time."
 
  Sunil Chadha, a businessman from the city, who was going to Lucknow to attend a family function, says, "I found out about the   at the airport, and as the trains were also running late because of the fog, we were looking for ways in which to travel to Lucknow. But the technicians solved the problem in time."
