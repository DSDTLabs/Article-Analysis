CHENNAI: The tsunami of 2004 had rocked   girl Indumathi’s life - she lost quite a few of her relatives and friends. Growing up, she found solace in football, and now on Valentine’s Day, it’s the beautiful game that presented her with the best gift of her life.

 
 Indumathi, now 24, scored one goal and set up another to help the   girls win their first-ever football nationals title beating   2-1 in the final in Cuttack. She was also the highest scorer and the player of the tournament, scoring 10 of Tamil Nadu’s 25 goals.
 
 “Football became a way of life when we were trying to start our lives all over again after the tsunami. I used to see the boys in our school playing football and having fun. It interested me and I would go and play with them. Our physical education teacher saw talent in me and I started training under him. Since I lost a few close relatives, my parents also supported me in whatever I did,”   told TOI from Cuttack.
 
 Indumathi, along with two other Cuddalore girls Vineeta and  , had switched allegiance to Tamil Nadu from Pondicherry this season after getting a job with Tamil Nadu police. “I was playing for Pondicherry earlier. I shifted only after getting the job. Now I have a sense of responsibility towards TN. I want to keep on playing for TN and inspire a lot others to take up football,” said the sub-inspector.
