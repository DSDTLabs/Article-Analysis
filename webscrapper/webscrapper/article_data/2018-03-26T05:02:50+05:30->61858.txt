NEW DELHI: While providing a platform to people to connect directly with the Prime Minister, the   app doesn’t store data to be used by third parties and users can access only their own data, official sources said on Sunday. 

 
 The   is ‘one of its kind’ which enables unprecedented engagement and interactivity and is way different from the standard ‘one-way’ flow of apps belonging to political leaders and parties. 
 
 On the reports citing concerns expressed by some, including a French cyber security researcher, a source said data “exposed by the French Twitter user is the data entered by the user on his own device. This is not a security breach. The person does not have access to any data apart from his own data”. “The app does not ask for blanket permissions,” the source said. 
 
 The app has numerous features which comprise the best from social media, sources said. Users can create their own profiles, earn points and win special awards for their activity levels. They can also connect with MPs, MLAs of their constituency and interact with them. Sources said the app acts as a work-flow management platform for lakhs of party workers. Even a booth worker can connect to the party president and PM. The app has enabled numerous engagements between sections of people and the PM, sources said, citing the ‘exam warriors’ module in which students from across the country have formed a community and write to the PM. For the Swachh Bharat campaign, people shared photos of their cleanliness activities.
