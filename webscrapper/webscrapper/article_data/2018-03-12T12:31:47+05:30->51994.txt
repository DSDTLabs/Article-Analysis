BIJNOR: Family members of some inmates lodged in Bijnor jail protested outside the prison on Sunday claiming that their kin were mercilessly assaulted by the jail authorities last month. The protesters demanded transfer of the jail superintendent and said that on February 22 the prison staff thrashed their kin and that they have come to know about it today. The agitators also accused the jail administration of extortion.
 
  Ruksana from Delhi, whose brother is lodged in the jail, said, “My brother  , a resident of Bijnor, was jailed in 2016. When I met him, he told me that the guards deployed inside the prison thrashed him and many others at the behest of superintendent  . He also told me that jail officials had demanded money from him.”
  
  Similarly, Bijnor-based Shabiya and   said, “Our relative   was also beaten up on that day after he failed to give money to jail officials.”
  
  Later in the day, families of prisoners met district magistrate   and demanded strict action against the jail administration.
  
  Meanwhile, refuting charges made against him, jail superintendent RK Mishra said, “These allegations are baseless. We were checking all barracks to ensure that no prisoner is using a mobile phone or other prohibited items. During checking, a few inmates created ruckus and we had to call extra force to control the situation. No one was beaten up.”
