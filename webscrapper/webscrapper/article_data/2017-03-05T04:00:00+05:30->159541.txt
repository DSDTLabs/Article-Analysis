Ahmedabad: Students of   and BA in Gujarat University tend to suffer big time with poor results and increasing backlogs, thanks to the carry-forward system implemented by the varsity. The results of BCom semester-3 were declared two days ago wherein a whopping 28,000 students failed with a meagre 33% pass rate. Similar was the case with BCom Semester 5 results where 23,000 students failed. Sources predict that Arts faculty will also have a pass rate of not more than 40%-50%.

 Experts have laid the blame of poor results at the door of the carry-forward system implemented in the varsity, wherein a student failing in any number of subjects in the current semester can enrol for the subsequent semester. 
 
 However, as the students keep moving onto subsequent semesters, their backlog subjects to be cleared keep piling up thus resulting in poor results. tnn
