JALANDHAR: Leaders of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) — the BJP’s youth wing — and their supporters have been booked for allegedly posting objectionable comments on social media against a young woman who had filed a complaint against Punjab BJP president Vijay Sampla’s nephew Ashu Sampla. Sheetal  , Deepak Luthra, and their supporters have been booked under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act by the   police.

 It is the second case in the episode, as a Special Investigation Team (SIT) is probing the complaint against Ashu. The women had lodged a complaint with the police that Angural and others indulged in her character assassination on social media, and called her names after she lodged a complaint against Ashu.
 
 Earlier, Angural and other BJP activists were booked earlier for blocking a road in support of Ashu outside the office of Jalandhar commissioner of police. A drama also took place on Friday when   threatened to block the   on the national highway. However, police blocked and made arrangements were made to ensure there was no obstruction at the busy intersection.
