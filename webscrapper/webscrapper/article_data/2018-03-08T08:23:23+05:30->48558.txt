As a trained chef, food does play a major role in the life of actress  . "Feeding others might be more important than eating but yes, food is important,” she tells us while visiting the   to promote her upcoming film  . So as a  , it is a shame that Masumeh has only heard stories about Delhi’s yummy food but never tasted it. “I have heard so much about the food here but sadly, in all my visits here, I have never had a chance to go out and eat,” she laments. And the reason behind her being deprived of feasting on Delhi’s culinary delights has been the capital’s infamous traffic. She explains, “The one thing I don’t like about Delhi is the   here. I come to Delhi often. Either for film promotions or for my work (she runs a content creation company) but on each visit, I have to go from one meeting to another and then to another. Because of this traffic, what should take five minutes takes 25 and I’m left with no time to explore the city or eat anything."
