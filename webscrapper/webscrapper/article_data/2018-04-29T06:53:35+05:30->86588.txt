JAIPUR: Following a The Times of India report of April 5 on the shoddy quality of work being undertaken at the   in Nohar tehsil of Hanumangarh district, a three-member team of the Rajasthan State Road Development and Construction Corporation conducted a two-day inspection of the site on April 5 and 6. 

 In its inquiry report, which the probe team explains was conducted after the news item appeared, the following problems were found: Shuttering being used in RCC was of poor quality, leaving a “very poor RCC surface” that had traces of gunny bags and pieces of shuttering remaining even after it was removed. (Shuttering is the mould into which concrete is poured before it solidifies). The team observed cracks in the plaster and columns, domes of temple were fixed without a care for whether the slabs used would remain intact; gap between stones along the expansion joints was uneven. There were also, as the earlier report pointed out, discrepancies in the quality of stone used.
 
 Joint secretary KS Gothwal said, “There will be technocrats now looking to how to address the problems that have been listed.”
