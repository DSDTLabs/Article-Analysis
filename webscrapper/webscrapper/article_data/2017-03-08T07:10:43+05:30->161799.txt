SURAT: Have you ever thought of sparing some time to educate underprivileged slum? Most of us haven’t had the time or opportunity to make a difference in the lives of less fortunate slum kids.

 Beena Rao, a lecturer at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), has given her life to educating slum children, especially from the backward  .
 
 Inspired by her father, who taught the violin to blind students, Beena took up teaching slum kids in 2006. With help from her husband, Beena started with just two or three kids and in the last decade has taught more than 10,000 kids from slums in the  .
 
 In 2009, she introduced the idea of ‘ Prayas free coaching classes’ to teach the slum kids. Some 800 kids are presently being taught in the evening hours at Prayas, at 10 different locations in the city. The kids are taught on pavements or in the open, by a team of young college students who volunteer to give free classes in the evenings.
 
 The emphasis of the free tuition classes under Prayas is basically to bring about the holistic development of children while inculcating morals and values in them. The motive is not only to educate the children but to work on enhancing their lifestyles, aspirations, mannerisms, etiquette, self-esteem and confidence. This has resulted in many slum kids giving up rowdy language and the use of slang. 
 
 That is why Rao organizes workshops for children in diverses areas like science, yoga, sports, art and craft, physical science. To give the kids a better understanding and to motivate their parents, she also invites police officers and doctors as guest lecturers.
 
 Speaking to TOI,   said, “This Women’s Day, we are going to start a mobile library and have movie screenings in 10 villages near Surat. In the summer vacation, we will start free coaching classes in these villages. We have a target to cover 1,000 children from the backward Halpati community.”
