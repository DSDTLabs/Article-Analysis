 “India is our third largest market and we are committed to growth on our home ground. When we started scaling in the mid-market industry, we realised that the data centre is an important requirement for customers especially in the health and financial industries,” said S T S Prasad, senior vice-president of engineering, Freshworks. 
 
 “The release will help local users have faster data transfers, lower latencies, and faster business performance,” he added.

 Freshworks CEO Girish Mathrubootham said the new Mumbai data centre is testament to India’s growth potential. “The time when everyone believed that Indian customers won’t pay for good business software is long gone. Indian businesses are now adopting software on a par with other global companies, and SaaS spend is a good chunk of it. With the new data centre, we are well placed to serve our Indian customers, especially in the enterprise space,” he said.
