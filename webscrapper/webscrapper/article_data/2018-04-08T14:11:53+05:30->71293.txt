VIJAYAWADA: City doctors successfully performed a bariatric surgery on a three-year-old girl who was suffering from obesity.   (3), a native of Jharkhand gained weight due to leptin receptor deficiency.

 She weighed 35 kilograms in August 2017 and was unable to walk properly due to her ailment. Her parents,   and Parveen due to their financial issues appealed for help through social media. It was during this time that Vijayawada-based bariatric surgeon Dr Kongara   came forward to perform surgery free of cost which was later carried out in November 2017 
 
 “Her sister had passed away with same leptin receptor deficiency at the age of 2. It was one of the most challenging cases for us and she was kept in the ICU for almost 3 months after the surgery,” Dr Ravikanth said. 
 
 “We performed the surgery for free with the support of a few donors and Alia has now lost 12 kgs and now can walk without support,” he added.
