NEW DELHI: More than 90% of the pickpockets apprehended by   at   stations in 2017 were  , according to data released recently. 

 Of the 1,311 people apprehended for pickpocketing, 1,222 (93.3%) were women. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials said that they have formed anti-theft squads to catch them, but the number of cases is not going down as not many arrests are being made. 
 
  
  “CISF does not have the power to file a case. We hand them over to the police, but if someone does not want to register a case against the  , then he/she is allowed to go...and then they return to a different metro station after some days. We have caught the same gang multiple times as well,” said a senior CISF official.
 
 CISF officials said that pickpockets mainly target interchange stations and stations that see a lot of rush, which include Rajiv Chowk, Central Secretariat, Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazar, New Delhi, among others. The women work in groups, often carrying children with them to distract commuters. Officials said that while one member pickpockets, others surround or stand near the target commuter to block the view of other passengers. The items found with them include laptops, phones, jewellery, wallets, purses and other accessories.
 
 CISF is tasked with the security of Delhi Metro and its complexes, and special teams often take rides on the train with other commuters. In 2017, a total of 1,941 men were deboarded and fined by CISF for entering the women’s coach, according to the latest data. In the same year, CISF also provided help in 248 cases of women in distress at metro stations and handed over 153 missing children back to their parents.
