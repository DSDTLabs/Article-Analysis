Madurai: H Raja met the Madurai city police commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal and demanded a fair investigation into the fire incident which took place at the Meenakshi Amman temple on Friday. The fire damaged 7,000 sq feet of the Veera Vasantharaja Mandapam near the Eastern Tower.

 The national secretary of the BJP visited the temple and heard the account of the temple officials before meeting the commissioner. Talking to media persons outside the temple premises he said the incident should be thoroughly investigated. 
 
 He also took a jibe at the Dravidian parties and said that their party cadres hold licenses for the shops inside the temple and have sublet them. Clearly the presence of the shops has taken its toll on the historical temple, he added.
 
 He said that non-Hindus were not be allowed inside the temple after a certain limit, but that it is being violated. He alleged that the fire accident was man-made and done with an ulterior motive. Police should scrutinise the video footage and take appropriate action against the suspects, he said.
