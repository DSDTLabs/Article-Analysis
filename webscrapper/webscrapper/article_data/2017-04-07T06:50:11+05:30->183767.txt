VIJAYAWADA: Nearly 15 lakh people in the state are suffering from depression or other  , according to psychiatrist  . 

 Pointing out that not a single programme has been launched by the government on the burning issue, he said the government and celebrities must do their bit in creating awareness on depression. Dr Indla said: "It is about time to talk openly about depression and the government should take the lead by chalking out public health programme and work towards breaking the social stigma associated with depression which is the underlying cause of almost every suicide."
 
 Speaking to TOI on 'Depression-let's talk', this year's theme of the   (WHO) on the eve of the   here on Thursday, he said 40 to 50 per cent cases of depression go without being diagnosed. 
 
 A patient is considered   if he has been suffering from severe depression for two or more weeks and its diagnosis in India is particularly difficult given the lack of awareness among the public and in the medical community. "In India, most of the patients suffering from depression visit a doctor with bodily symptoms like pains or headache and most of them lead to misdiagnosis. A general physician will not be able to diagnose this problem as the medical curriculum doesn't give due priority to psychiatry," said Dr Indla.
