However, only the centre superintendent can have a cellphone with him to be in contact with the authorities, it added.
 
 The council has suggested the centre superintendent to create a cloak room to keep cellphones of the staff members, if required. "Mobile phones are a big nuisance.

To ensure no leak of question through cellphones or any other means a new set of guidelines will be issued soon," said  , deputy controller of examinations, CHSE. 
 
 Gate check and body frisking of all candidates will be done before the start of the examination and students must take their seats 15 minutes before the scheduled time. 
 
 Groups of people or large crowd will not be allowed to gather around the examination centres. Strict vigil should be kept around the examination centre so that question papers do not go out of the examination halls during the hours of examination by any means. Besides, several other steps have also been asked to do to check malpractice.
