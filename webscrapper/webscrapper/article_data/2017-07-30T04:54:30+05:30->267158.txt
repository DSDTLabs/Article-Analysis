NOIDA: A one-month-old girl was abandoned by her mother at   on July 20. The infant, currently admitted to the hospital under the care of representatives from FXB IndiaSuraksha-Childline, is waiting for her parents to return as she cannot be sent for adoption to the child welfare committee (CWC), Mathura, as her parents’ identity is known from the details shared by the mother at the hospital.

 ESIC Hospital director Dr Neelima filed a complaint with the police at 2.26pm on July 27 after which a police response vehicle (PRV) arrived at the hospital and took cognisance of the case.
 
 The police subsequently called Childline and handed over the baby in the care of two members of the NGO.
 
 According to the hospital, the child was born to a Salarpur resident, whose Aadhaar number and phone number are available in the hospital’s records.
 
 “After the delivery on July 2, the mother disappeared on July 20 without any intimation. The phone number is functional but no one is answering calls at the contact number,” the complaint filed by Dr Neelima said. 
 
 Sources said that since the time of the mother’s admission, no one from the family turned up to look after her even once, either to see the child or the mother.
 
 “We have approached the police to trace the mother as all the details about her are available. We cannot take the child to   as her parents’ identity is known. If the child has to be sent for adoption, that requires legal permission from the parents. If they are unable to look after the child, we can initiate the adoption proceedings,” Satya Prakash, manager, FXB Suraksha-Childline told TOI.
