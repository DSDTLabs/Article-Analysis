NEW DELHI:   came   after   at different runways of   earlier this week, with the foreign airliner allegedly exiting the runway from a taxiway — it was not supposed to be on — where the other plane which had landed at another runway was present. The two found themselves in front of each other. Luckily since the plane was   at slow speed, it stopped in time before getting dangerously close to the other one.

 This latest episode happened on Wednesday, after SpiceJet’s flight SG 012 came from Dubai and an Aeroflot plane flew in from Moscow. “The SpiceJet flight landed on Runway 29 at IGI airport. After landing it vacated active runway by taxiway Z6 and was instructed by the air traffic control (ATC) to taxi via taxiways CW2, S, R5 to the allocated parking stand A12L. While taxiing on CW2, the crew were asked to hold before taxiway S, to give way to a Jet Airways flight,” SpiceJet said in a statement.
 
 “Meanwhile Aeroflot flight landed on Runway 28 and was instructed by ATC to taxi via taxiway N, S and CW1. Aeroflot flight wrongly entered CW2. The SpiceJet crew apprised ATC of the situation and ATC asked the Aeroflot aircraft to stop. The aircraft was pushed back. SpiceJet crew then taxied to the allocated parking stand A12L. Both aircraft were at a safe distance from each other and at no point safety was compromised,” SpiceJet added.
 
 The DGCA is examining this latest scare at IGI airport. In December 2016 also a SpiceJet and an IndiGo aircraft had come nose-to-nose at IGI airport. A DGCA probe found this had happened due to the lack of a designated VIP “follow me jeep” — which drive right in front of aircraft to show them the way while taxing in dense fog.
