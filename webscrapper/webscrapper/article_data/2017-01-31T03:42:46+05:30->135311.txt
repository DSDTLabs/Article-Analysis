New Delhi: A Delhi court on Monday summoned chief minister   and suspended BJP MP Kirti   in a   filed by the Delhi and District Cricket Association ( ) and its vice-president Chetan Chauhan.

 The court said that prima facie   had made “defamatory imputation” that may harm the reputation of DDCA and its officials and Azad had made “disparaging allegation” against the cricketing body. The two leaders had alleged financial irregularities and major wrong-doings in the cricketing body, including a sex racket. “Kejriwal had alleged that sexual favour is sought by DDCA members for selecting a player,” stressed the complainants.
 
 “Under the aegis of DDCA, hundreds of players are playing cricket. Such a drastic statement and that too from the chief minister may have a negative impact and leave an adverse impression on the mind of cricketers, officials and public at large, impacting reputation of the body, its organisational functioning and transparency of the selection process,” the court observed.
 
 The complainants alleged that Kejriwal had made “scandalous” remarks against them on national television and these were endorsed and repeated by Azad. Metropolitan magistrate Abhilash Malhotra said that a person, especially holding a constitutional post, is expected to exercise sensitivity while making discourses that may tarnish the reputation of an institution working in public domain.
