KOCHI / MALAPPURAM: The day after   C Raveendranath revealed in the assembly that around 1.25 lakh school students had refused to divulge their caste and religion –the government tom-tomming it as a sign of progressive thinking – during admissions, Al Hidayath English Medium School at   near Kondotty contested the findings.

 According to the report submitted by the school authorities to assistant educational officer ( ), of 1,120 students admitted to the school during the period in question, 1,118 students have revealed that they are Muslims while one student declared that he is a Christian. Another declared that he belongs to SC community. Vice-principal of the school, T P  , said that the data disclosed by the minister was misleading and incorrect. “We had properly uploaded the details of caste and religion of all students of the school and we don’t know how the error occurred”, he said.
 
 “The caste column is often not filled unless the student is eligible for any special benefits. The information is based on the data available on Sampoorna software. There is no question of suppressing or distorting the facts,” said  , general secretary, KSTA.
