NEW DELHI: A 10-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by an elderly man in southwest Delhi’s Palam on Monday when she had gone to purchase stationary items from a   near her house.

 Police said that they received a call about the incident at 9 pm on Monday, whereas the incident had taken place a day before. They said that the girl had informed her teacher before informing her parents.
 
 The girl’s parents told the police that she had gone out to buy stationary items from the shop. She was, however, forced inside the shop by the owner. The man later shut his shop for some time and warned the girl that he would sexually assault her again if she told anyone about the incident.
 
 The girl did not inform anyone in her family. She went to school on Monday and told her teacher about the incident.
 
 “We registered a case at the Palam police station. A team was constituted to nab the accused, who is at large. His shop remains closed,” said a police official.
