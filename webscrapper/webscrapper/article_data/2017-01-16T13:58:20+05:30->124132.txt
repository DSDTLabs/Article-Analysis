NASHIK: The wait for getting reports of food samples sent by the   (FDA) officials is likely to be over in a couple of years, as the FDA has sent a proposal of constructing a food and drug laboratory on the outskirts of the city.

 Senior   informed that their department had a plot measuring 2 acre in the   — around 15 km from the city. “Since the cabinet has approved the proposal for upgrading the FDA, funds for the laboratory in Nashik would soon be available and the entire process of sending food samples to Pune would be over,” said an official.
 
 “Between April and November last year, we sent 893 food samples to the concerned laboratories, which meant over 100 samples were sent from Nashik every month. This does not include the samples sent by the drugs department of the FDA. However, since the load on the concerned lab was more, it took nearly a month for the arrival of the report, when according to provisions under the Act, the test reports should be available within 14 days.”
 
 US Vanjari, joint commissioner of FDA (Food) Nashik Division, said the laboratory for Nashik would be only for the division which has five district under it — Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar. This would ensure the test reports would be arriving on time for necessary action.
 
 An official said the government should also approve necessary staff for the lab as in some parts of the state, the labs are there but not functioning due to the lack of staff.
 
 Meanwhile, the FDA official said the premises of the lab would also have a godown for keeping collected food and drug samples. Currently, most of the samples that are collected are kept at the FDA office at Udyog Bhavan on Trimbak Road.
