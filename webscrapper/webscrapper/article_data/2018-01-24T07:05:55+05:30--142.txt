CHINSURAH/MIDNAPORE: A pall of gloom descended in   on Tuesday when the news of   arrived at his home.
 
 While Samaresh’s mother Namita shut herself inside a room, his father Anil — a vegetable seller — just sat and cried. Their neighbours couldn’t believe such a brilliant youth took his life. The victim’s sister, Rita Biswas, said, “Samaresh was depressed after he ‘married’ his minor student. They were staying at the girl’s parental home in a colony adjoining Rabindranagar. The girl was trying to separate him from us. “The girl’s family would torture my son, who was taking sleeping pills to overcome depression,” said Anil.
 
 Samaresh tried to bring the two families together. Last year on August 22, he brought his ‘wife’ home but it didn’t go well. The girl left swearing she would never come back,” a relative said.
 
 The girl, daughter of a rickshaw-puller, said, “Samaresh forced me into the marriage against my family’s will. I continued to live at my own house and had no contact with Samaresh for the last five months. I can’t comment on his death.”
 
 The victim’s elder brother Amalesh said, “Our family is poor and we educated Samaresh with great difficulty. He tutored a girl in Rabindranagar. He sat for the state civil service exam in 2015 and got selected. That’s when the girl and her mother began pressurising him to separate from us. He attempted suicide twice before and was under psychiatric treatment.”
