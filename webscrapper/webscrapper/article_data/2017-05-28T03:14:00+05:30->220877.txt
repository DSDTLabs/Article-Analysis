Saligao: In a bid to control the spread of plastic waste in the state, chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday announced that a fine of Rs 10,000 would be imposed on those caught littering public places with plastic waste. “We are banning the use of plastic and plastic bottles,” Parrikar said. As a further incentive to cut down on use of plastic the CM said that the government would provide incentives to kiosk owners to buy glass bottles and would work out a way to buy back the bottles, but after panchayat elections. “Plastic carry bags will also be banned,” Parrikar said speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the ‘Sound of Joy’ concert, the closing event for the eco-art installation ‘Carpet of Joy’ by artist Subodh Kerkar. Parrikar also said the Saligao panchayat would be provided with 200 garbage bins, a truck, and some personnel to ensure that the village is plastic- and garbage-free.  While presenting his budget for the 2017-18 fiscal, the chief minister had announced his aim of ridding the entire state of garbage by 2020 and had set aside Rs 11.6 lakh for a comprehensive waste management programme.
