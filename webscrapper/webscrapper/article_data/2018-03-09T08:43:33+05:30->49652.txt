KOCHI: Some of the engineering colleges in the city are teaching foreign languages to give graduates a global marketplace edge. However, at the moment just about 10 to 15 % of the students have shown interest to learn a foreign language, with in some colleges the enrolment in such courses as low as 1%.

 But placement officers of these engineering colleges admit that they can no longer assume that English will continue to be the language of global business and industry in the years to come. And without doubt, learning a new language is a smart move for any young engineer or technologist bidding to work on the world stage.
 
 What is interesting is that some of the colleges have signed MoU with universities in  . In many cases ,this is converted to job. Our students have an option to study Japanese and German and we have an MoU with universities in these countries,” said  , placement officer,   and Technology. They have 15 students studying Japanese and 20 students studying German. Japanese is especially popular with mechanical engineering students. “However, mere knowledge of the foreign language is not enough. They need to have advanced knowledge of the language to get a job in a foreign country. Japanese companies have shown interest to hire BTech students who know Japanese from our campus,” said  , faculty in-charge, placement of engineering students at  .
