PANAJI: The ferry service between Vasco and Panaji which started a few months ago has received a lukewarm response so far.  , who operates the service for   (MPT), expects it to gain momentum in another two seasons.

 
 The company is keen to add two more routes next season—Baga, Sinquerim, Old Goa and Mobor, Palolem. Drishti Marine’s chief executive officer Ravi Shankar, who foresees great potential in Goa’s waters, says it will take them two-three tourist seasons to gain popularity.
 
 “It takes time for any kind of service to stabilise,” he says, adding that they plan to expand their service and more vessels will be added once they get permission to ply ferries along other routes.
 
 Shankar said that it has taken longer than expected to get permissions from various authorities.
 
 In fact, Drishti Marine plans to connect all major tourist destinations and beaches in Goa with jetties. It expects to open up opportunitites for tourists, boat owners and commuters to move between any two destinations using inland waterways.
 
 The inland ferry service is not only an addition of a premium service for tourists and local residents, but as envisioned by the state department, it adds to the range of offerings in terms of ‘things to do’ in Goa for the thousands of tourists who visit the state, Shankar says.
