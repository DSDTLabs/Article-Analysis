Surat: In coming three months, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) would be richer by at least Rs 80 crore. This amount is due from various mobile tower companies for last few years. They had approached high court, to interpret Supreme Court order that stated that these companies have to pay municipal property taxes to the local bodies where towers are erected.  However, high court on March 7, refused to admit these petitions of different tower owner companies and as a result SMC will now start recovery of dues from these mobile tower companies.  In Surat municipal limits, there are 1,400 such mobile towers of seven different telecom companies. These mobile companies have not paid tax since four years. The total dues amount to more than Rs 80 crore.  “We have already served them bills, notices in past and have been doing it regularly. If they don’t pay up in coming few days, SMC would be compelled to take strict action to recover money,” said Sharad Mehta, deputy commissioner (finance), SMC .
