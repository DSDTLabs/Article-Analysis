KHARGONE: Three persons were arrested with five country made pistols from a bus near Bhikangaon in   district.

 Based on tip off, cops intercepted a Khargone-Khandwa bus and arrested Tope Singh Sikligar, Anil and Kamesh Choukse. Tope and Anil are residents of Dhakalgaon, said Bhikangaon SDOP PS Ranawat.
 
 During questioning, cops learnt that Rs 17,000 was deposited in bank account of Tope and the trio was heading towards   to supply the weapons.
 
 They were presented before court, which sent Tope Singh to police remand till May 30.
 
 Ranawat said that police had launched a drive in January and February to make Sikligars join mainstream, but in vain. Tope Singh is a big shot in this business, while Anil and Kamesh were used as carrier.
