Chandigarh: With 42 journalists sacrificing their lives in the line of duty in 25 years and three of them dying in a month alone in the past one year, India needs a new law to protect the freedom of press from violence and intimidation.

 This was the message sent out during a protest attended by more than 100 journalists at the Chandigarh   on Monday. The agitation was organized in response to a nationwide call given by the Federation of Press Clubs of India.
 
 Over 100 journalists, covering Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, from print and electronic, participated in the protest. At the protest, journalists formed a human chain, and discussed a wide array of issues, ranging from the importance of press in a democracy to the role of the government, state and Centre, in ensuring their safety.
 
 They said that in the absence of a government protocol for protecting journalistsÂ¸ it vital for people entering the profession to be able to guard themselves. They said that journalism was a respected profession until two decades ago, but that had changed now and even a single story could lead to an attack.
