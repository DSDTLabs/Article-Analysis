CHANDIGARH: Business may have been a trifle slow at Haryana's most popular animal fair at   this time, but a tall, dark and handsome male remained the virtual showstopper of the three-day event, making many a female participant miss a heart beat or two. 

 Sonu, who is 55 inches tall, drew many appreciative glances and buyers, but  , the owner of this three-and-a half-year-old  , is not willing to part with him even for Rs 5 lakh. Sonu stands a hand or two above the other donkeys, whose height is generally 20-30 inches.
 
 The animal is vital for Kumar's business. Charging Rs 5000-8000 per mating session with the donkey, the latter earns around Rs 2 lakh in a season, especially during summer.
 
 When asked what led him to bring the animal to the fair if he didn't want to sell it, Kumar said he saw the fair as the right stage to showcase his prized animal. Kumar, who is from Naya Bans village, near Ganaur, in  , made most of the occasion, giving out visiting cards to people. "Sonu was born at our house and is like my child. I spend around Rs 17,000 a month on his diet and maintenance," Kumar told TOI over phone on Tuesday.
