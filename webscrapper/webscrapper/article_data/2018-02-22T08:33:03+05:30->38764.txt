  The government issued a notification on January 6, 2018 amending an earlier notification by including solid waste management under ESMA. "No fundamental rights have been violated by introducing the Karnataka State Essential Service Maintenance Act 2013. It is enforceable since essential services which are primary need of citizens should not be halted by protests. It is in the best interest of the citizens that the Act has been brought into force," BBMP claimed. 
 
 It said the direct payment of wages is in consonance with the August 7, 2017 directive of the state government asking urban local bodies to make payments that way. "The aim is avoid middlemen and ensure the workers get their wages fully. BBMP is implementing the government's orders," it added.
 
 The court will take up the matter on March 7.
