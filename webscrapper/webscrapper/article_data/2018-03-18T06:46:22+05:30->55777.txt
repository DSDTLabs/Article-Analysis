KOCHI: Speaking at a seminar on ‘The challenges faced by democracy’ here on Saturday, former   Cyriac Joseph highlighted the case of Justice KM Joseph, chief justice of Uttarakhand, who was not elevated to the SC allegedly because he had quashed President’s Rule in the state and thus antagonised the powers-that-be. "The message that the Union government is trying to convey is that they would object to anybody who opposes the political ideology propagated by them," Justice   said.

 He also referred to the case of justice Jayant Patel, who quit as judge of   high court following his transfer to Allahabad high court, when he was tipped for elevation, a transfer that would have reduced him to a puisne (junior) judge in the Allahabad HC. Justice Patel had directed a CBI investigation into the   fake encounter case when he was acting chief justice of Gujarat high court. Senior SC advocate Prasanth Bhushan, in his keynote address, said that all four pillars of democracy were affected with corruption.
