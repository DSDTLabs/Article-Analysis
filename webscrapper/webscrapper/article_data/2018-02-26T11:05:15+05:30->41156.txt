The runway expansion of   is expected to boost the development of the airport as well as the economy of the region. While the domestic passenger traffic through the airport is growing by leaps and bounds, the longer runway will help the airport grow faster in the international passenger sector as well.

 The expansion of the runway from the current 7,500 feet to 12,500 feet will enable wide body aircraft to use the airport. At present, the airport is handling only narrow body aircraft. Once the acquisition is completed, there would be more space for the   ( ) to think of many developmental activities. Airport enthusiasts say that the expansion of apron, construction of new terminal and new cargo building can be carried out.
 
 Senior president of   (TNCCI) S   said that once the runway is expanded, it will enhance the international flight connectivity. Apart from the development of the airport, it will also help the development of economy of the region.
 
 He said that the Chennai airport is choking at night as there is space crunch for the parking of the flights. Once Madurai airport gets more space, aircraft can use Madurai airport for parking. This will result in bringing down the ticket fare, as the flights coming for parking would offer tickets at throwaway price.
 
 Aviation enthusiast Mohammed Mustafa said as the airport is expected to grow fast, terminal building expansion and apron expansion are immediate needs. "Round-the-clock operation should be introduced. Services such as Delhi-Madurai-Singapore and Cochin-Madurai-Singapore got nod only after a lot of difficulties due to the shortage of manpower," he said.
 
 He also said that Madurai airport needs a parallel taxiway, which will help aircraft turnaround quickly. At present, there is no exit in the middle of the runway. The small aircraft, which use only half of the runway, have to go till the end because of the absence of the exit.
