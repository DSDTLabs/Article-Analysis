KOLKATA: A 28-year-old   by an   that held him   for hours before finally releasing him late at night. Worse, some cops, who secured his release, allegedly forced  ,  , to cough up around Rs 95,000 even as he recuperated at SSKM Hospital after being beaten up.

 The police, however, claimed Sahu was involved in a financial dispute with some men near Navina cinema and that there was no complaint from him, alleging either extortion or kidnapping.
 
 According to Sahu, who had taken to trading after resigning from a top-notch BPO, he had stepped out of his home around 2.30pm on Saturday, when three persons, led by criminals of the Hudda Raju gang, bundled him into an auto. They kept roaming around Navina and then Golf Green before forcing him into a parlour at Jadavpur, he said. The accused initially demanded Rs 5 lakh from him but settled for Rs 2.5 lakh, Sahu alleged, adding they made him sign on a blank stamp paper.
 
 “Around 5.30pm, I finally managed to call up a friend but he could not register a complaint wither at the Charu Market or the Jadavpur police station, as the cops claimed the crime was committed outside their area. My relatives got in touch with the detective department following which, the Charu Market cops rescued me from near the Lords crossing. But an officer alleged I was cheating as I had not paid up Rs 2.5 lakh to my captors. I was finally released after paying them Rs 95,000,” he claimed.
 
 The cops called the account a figment of Sahu’s imagination. “He has come up with such a story. He never spoke to us about any abduction. We are still awaiting a formal complaint,” said an officer from the Charu Market police station. Sources at detective department though claimed at least three persons had been detained.
