NEW DELHI: There will be respite from the biting cold over the next few days as both maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover just above normal with clear skies persisting in the region.

 Delhi’s maximum temperature was recorded at 22.7 degrees Celsius — three notches above normal for the season. The minimum temperature, too, remained high on Thursday, recorded at 8 degrees Celsius – one degree above normal.
 
 Officials from Regional   Forecasting Centre in Delhi said the capital is unlikely to see a sharp drop in temperature over the next 4-5 days, owing to clear skies. The minimum temperature, which had fallen to 4.2 degrees on Tuesday, has shown a spike once again and was recorded above normal on Thursday. Forecast for Friday shows a maximum and minimum temperature of 24 and 8 degrees Celsius, respectively.
 
 “We have clear skies, which has caused a rise in temperatures again. Delhi is unlikely to see a drop anytime soon,” said a RWFC official.
