AHMEDABAD: After a   in December 2017 when   were significant,   significantly declined in January 2018. 

 Data provided by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex indicates that imports of gold in the state declined by 79.86% in January 2018 and fell to 2.656 metric tonnes (MT) against inports in December 2017. In December 2017, gold imports stood at 13.18 MT.
 
 Experts attribute the decline in gold imports to fear of reduction in basic customs duty on the yellow metal in the run-up to the Union budget. This had made investors refrain from investing in gold. 
 
 “Industry and investors expected a fall in the basic customs duty on gold which currently stands at 10%. Investors therefore waited for the announcement of the Union Budget and refrained from investments,” said Shanti Patel, president, Gems and Jewellery Trade Council.
 
 Gold prices on Friday stood at Rs 31,650 per 10 gram, including Goods and Services Tax (GST). It may be recalled that gold prices had gone up at January-end by at least Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per 10 gram. 
 
 “Gold prices went up in anticipation of weakening of the rupee. Investors were expecting a hike in the US federal rate and in oil prices in the past one week,” said Surendra Mehta, secretary,   (IBJA).
 
 Despite industry expectations, there was no cut on the basic customs duty of 10% which is levied on import of gold. However, the announcements on classifying gold as an asset class and revamping gold monetization scheme to make it consumer-friendly, were well received.
 
 It may be recalled that gold imports in January 2018 had declined marginally by 10.57% against the corresponding period in January 2017 when 2.97 MT gold was imported into the state. Even as the gold imports have declined, the demand for jewellery has remained fairly high, said jewellers. 
 
 “Demand for jewellery has been fairly good. After Uttarayan, as the Kamurta period ended, jewellery demand has been good because of the wedding season,” said Manoj Soni, a jeweller based in Ahmedabad. Kamurta is considered inauspicious for gold purchase.
