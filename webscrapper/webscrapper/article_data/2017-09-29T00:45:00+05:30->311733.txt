Udhagamandalam: The district administration has finally commenced the cleaning/desilting of Kodappamund channel, which runs through the heart of Ooty town,  .

 The channel, meant for collecting spring and natural resource water, is the main source of water for Ooty Lake. It, however, had been filled with sewage water for the past several years.
 
 The district administration, in association with Ooty municipality, started the cleaning drive on Thursday with the participation of more than 100 municipal and town panchayat workers, and volunteers from various NGOs.
 
 The Kodappamund channel, activists said, had over the years become a “dump yard” for several merchants, residents and tourists. “The channel needs to be desilted as it is filled with overgrown weeds and other waste,” they said.
 
 According to the activists, several establishments and residences discharge sewage water directly into the channel. “As a result, the Ooty Lake has become one of the most polluted water bodies in the country,” they said.
 
 Though the public works department (PWD) had recently undertaken the cleaning of the channel, its condition hasn’t improved much.
 
 “As instructed by the district collector, we have formed five teams, involving municipal and town panchayat workers and NGOs to clean/desilt the Kodammund channel. It is a huge task and involvement of the public is the need of the hour,” Dr Murali Shankar, Ooty Municipal health officer, told TOI.
 
 “In some places JCBs (earth movers) were used to remove the silt and other garbage. “The work will continue and we will soon see a clean channel,” the officer added.
 
 Ten volunteers from Delightz Inn was also part of the drive. “It is part of our social responsibility. We will always support causes such as this,” R Arun, executive director, DelightZ Inn told TOI. 
 
 The cleaning drive also saw participation of over 10 volunteers from Make Ooty Beautiful, which had taken out a rally to save Kodappamund channel last June.
