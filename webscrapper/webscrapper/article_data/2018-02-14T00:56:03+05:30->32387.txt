Tirupur: Even after three days, the relatives of staff nurse R Manimala, who allegedly committed suicide due to torture from two doctors, were refusing to receive her body and continued their sit-in at the Kangeyam Government hospital.

 On the other hand, the Tirupur rural police were conducting inquiries with staff members of Vellakoil primary health centre to find whether allegations against the doctors were true. 
 
 Manimala of Panruti in Cuddalore district was working under Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) scheme in Vellakoil block for the last two years. The 26-year-old unmarried nurse was staying in the government quarters along with another nurse. On Saturday evening, Manimala was found hanging in her room.
 
 More than 100 people including her relatives and government hospital staff members were continuing the sit-in at the hospital where Manimala’s body was kept. The eight round of peace talks between protesters and state government officials have failed to yield any result. 
 
 “We have suspicion over Manimala’s death as she was not the girl who would give up easily. The two doctors, Vellakoil Block medical officer and RBSK team doctor, tortured her amid their personal quarrels,” said S Dhevanathan, Manimala’s uncle.
 
 “We demand the police to register a case against the doctors. We are protesting intensively as we wanted to ensure that such situation should never come to other staff nurses. Manimala’s parents have dedicated their lives to their three children but now they have lost the dearest one,” Dhevanathan added.
 
 S Jayanthi, deputy director of health services (Tirupur), told TOI, “We were trying to pacify the protesters but we could not as of now. Only after completion of departmental inquiry, we could know whether the doctors had any role in the nurse’s death.”
