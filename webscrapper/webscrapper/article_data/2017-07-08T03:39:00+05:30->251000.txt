Nagpur: Rainfall has taken a back seat in the city since the beginning of this month. In last seven days, the city has not even received 30% of the rainfall as expected. The situation is more or less the same across Vidarbha. Even for the coming six days, there isn’t much hope for decent rainfall, according to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Nonetheless, if the season’s rainfall till June 1 is considered, the city continues to be in the list of districts receiving normal rain. By the end of June, IMD had predicted 100% rainfall for July. But since the beginning of July, the city received rainfall only on two days — July 1 (41.7mm) and July 2 (24.6mm). There have been only traces of rainfall on the remaining days so far. Cumulatively, the city has received only 71.3mm rainfall since July 1. The expected rainfall was 223.9mm during the period. “The low rainfall is because of the western disturbance with upper air cyclonic circulation over Jammu % Kashmir and neighbourhood between 3.1km and 5.8km above mean sea level,” IMD has stated. The situation may persist in the coming days. However, according to the seasonal rain activities since June 1 till date, the rainfall departure of the city stands at -17%. A rainfall departure anywhere between -19% and +19% is considered normal. As far as the region is concerned, Amravati (-34%), Bhandara (-27%), Gondia (-33%), Chandrapur (-28%) and Gadchiroli (-23%) have proved to be rainfall deficit districts. On the other hand, districts such as Wardha (9%), Yavatmal (-9%), Washim (1%), Akola (-15%) and Buldhana (8) have been receiving normal rainfall. As per the latest data recorded by IMD between 8am on Thursday and 8am on Friday, no rainfall was recorded in all the districts of the region. The skies will remain mostly clear till July 13, according to IMD. There is no rainfall warning for the next six days in the region. Instead, the city may witness partly cloudy skies with a haze for the next two days.
