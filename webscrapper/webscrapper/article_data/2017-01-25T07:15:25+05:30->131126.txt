TIRUMALA: The   (TTD) hopes to have abundant   by 2025 as its plantations on 250 acres would have fully grown by then.

 With 25 kg of paste from a tree, officials estimate that 1,250 tonne of paste would be available in the next 10 years.TTD uses about 80kg a day and it's even planning to provide the excess paste to other shrines under it. In the next two decades, sandalwood is expected to cost `1lakh for a kg. Sandalwood is applied to the main as well as procession deity in the sanctum sanctorum at the time of changing jewellery and during other Arjita sevas.It's also used in sacred `theertham' of the lord.
 
 TTD has about 17 tonne reserves, enough to last next 1015 years. But after that availability of sandalwood has been a big question mark even from neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. In 2008, TTD had spent `57 lakh per tonne for 20 tonne of sandalwood from Satyamangalam in TN. Anticipating future shortage of paste, TTD forest department in 2013 zeroed in on   to cultivate sandalwood. TTD then sourced about 16,000 saplings from Bangalore-based Institute of   .The sandalwood is stored in   at Tirupati where it has a cold storage to retain its wetness.TTD is also equipped with technology that triggers a shower to keep logs safe from fire.
 
 Ninety per cent of sandalwood reserves are in Kuppam, Palamaneru, Punganur, Madanapalli, all in Chittoor, Kolar, Hospet in Karnataka and Sayamangalam forest in TN.But massive demand in the Gulf has led to rampant smuggling. Even though Seshachalam range has abundant sandalwood saplings, forest department too stopped growing them due to the the smuggling menace.
