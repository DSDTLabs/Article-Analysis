BHOPAL: At least 28 people commit suicide on an average day in  , says shocking data from the   (NCRB) report released on December 30, 2016. 

 What's more, Bhopal saw the highest rise in suicides, from 40 in 2014 to 378 in 2015 - a bone-chilling spurt of 945% in a year.
 
 Already the rape capital of the country, MP may now find itself on top of the suicide chart too. The state accounts for 7.7% of suicides reported in India in 2015. With 10,293 suicides, this is the first time MP figures among the worst five states in this category after Maharashtra (16,970),   (15,777),   (14,602) and Karnataka (10,786). Love affairs accounted for 3.3% of these and the most common methods were poison (as seen in Thursday's suicide pact) and jumping into a well. The four metros - Chennai (2,274), Bengaluru (1,855), Delhi (1,553) and Mumbai (1,122) - reported the highest number of suicides. Bhopal is way behind them but what's alarming is the spurt. MP also reported maximum cases of mass/family suicides (17), followed by Andhra Pradesh (15), Maharashtra (11) and Rajasthan (10). 
 
  HoD -psychiatry Dr R N Sahu said, "The young and the elderly are more vulnerable to suicide, which is becoming a leading cause of death these days. The way people suffer from liver, kidney and heart ailments, they also suffer from mental diseases, which mostly goes unrecognised and leads to suicide. Poor mental health awareness and non-availability of qualified mental health professionals is also one of the reasons. It is high time that society develops right perspective towards mental diseases and patients."
