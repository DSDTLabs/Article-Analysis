Coimbatore: Several large hoardings wishing late chief minister J Jayalalithaa on her 70th birth anniversary have come up along the pavements and roads at prominent areas in the city,  .

 Apart from political hoardings and flex boards, advertisements for real estate projects were also seen in areas such as Selvapuram. Some were placed blocking walkways, causing hardship to the public and particularly, school children, who were forced to walk on the roads. 
 
 Social activists say the trend highlights the negligent attitude of authorities, even after hoardings cost the life of K Raghupathy, a city youth, last year. 
 
 K Kathirmathiyon of the Coimbatore Consumer Cause said recently, the Madras high court had pulled up officials for hoardings placed in violation of rules. “The chief justice of Madras high court said she had seen hoarding placed violating rules along a road she was passing through. But, there is no high court in Coimbatore and no one to take up the issue,” he said.
 
 Kathirmathiyon said erecting hoardings at traffic junctions and pavements were a clear violation of the rules. “The reason why such political hoardings continue to come up might be due to the apathy of officials. Either there might be political pressure on the officials or they are wilfully silent fearing repercussions,” he said.
 
 When contacted, a city corporation official, however, said they do not allow people to erect hoardings or flex boards without permission. “We make sure that they get the necessary permission before installing hoardings,” an official said.
 
 However, DMK members alleged that the hoardings placed on the birth anniversary of Jayalalithaa were erected without getting the approval. “Even if they had obtained permission, such hoardings can be placed for only three days before and after a particular event. But, they are still seen around the city,” said SM Samy, a former DMK corporation councillor.
