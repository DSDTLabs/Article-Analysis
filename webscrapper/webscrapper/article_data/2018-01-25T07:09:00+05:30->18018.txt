AMRITSAR: Hoisted last on August 15, 2017, the tricolour flew high on the country’s tallest flagpole at 360 feet at Attari along the Pakistan border again on Wednesday, two days ahead of India’s Republic Day.

 The Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT), which had a difficult time in maintaining the flag due to its wear and tear and was forced to bring it down on several occasions, hoisted the tricolour at the border.
 
 Interestingly, even the Pakistani authorities also put the country’s largest flag (measuring 120 feet by 80 feet, on the 400 feet tall flagpole) back at Wagah on Wednesday evening, a day after it was brought down following some damage due to the inclement weather. 
 
 Pakistan authorities had installed their flag following a game of one-upmanship as India had put up a flag measuring 72 feet by 120 feet on a 360-foot tall flagpole, tallest in the country, at Attari on March 5, 2017.
 
 Punjab’s former cabinet minister Anil Joshi had hoisted the flag at Attari. However, his decision to hoist the tallest tricolour at Attari, which was also dubbed to make every Indian swell with pride as it was visible from Lahore in Pakistan, proved to be a damp squib.
 
 Having failed to stay aloft for various reasons, the decision to hoist tricolour of a mammoth size atop the 360-foot flagpole not only came under criticism but has also triggered a debate whether those in power could make decisions on the issues of national pride on political grounds, without any prior technical and feasibility studies.
 
 Though the AIT authorities had downsized the Attari flag to 60 feet by 90 feet, but there was no change in its wear and tear.
