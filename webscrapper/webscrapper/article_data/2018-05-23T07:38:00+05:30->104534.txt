Dharamshala: Families of the 24 children killed in the April 9 school-bus accident in Nurpur, Kangra, said on Tuesday that they would move the Himachal Pradesh high court against government officials who allowed the “unfit” bus to operate in the district.

 The parents said they were dissatisfied with the inquiry report and met Kangra superintendent of police on May 18 to present their report on the bus and some other facts. They demanded serious action on points mentioned by them. “We have recorded evidences after talking to children injured in the accident. We will write to the high court, as we had given a five-day ultimatum to the government,” said Vikram Pathania who lost his daughter.
 
 On Tuesday, senior police officials visited the spot, but parents said there had been no action for four days. They said police officials arrived on the scene on Tuesday to hush up the matter as it was the fifth day after they made the request. “A senior officer, Dinesh Kumar, gave us an assurance of examining the case from all angles mentioned in our report,” said Ajay Pathania, another parent.
 
 Parents have been asking the state government not to blame the deceased driver of the bus for the accident and demanded that it fixes responsibility in the state machinery for laxity.
 
 Parents have been blaming the public works department and transport department for the accident. They said there were trees at the accident spot which were cut down and a retaining wall was erected, but it eroded within a few days due to poor quality.
 
 They have blamed the transport department, claiming that the chassis number had been tampered with and the school was the third owner of the bus.
