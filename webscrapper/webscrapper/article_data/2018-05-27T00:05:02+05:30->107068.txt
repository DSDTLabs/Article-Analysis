KALYAN: A six-year-old girl   in a   inside the clubhouse of Casa Bella apartment situated in the   township of   (East) on Friday evening. 

 While blaming the pool management for negligence, the child’s father alleged there was no   around and the pool area was poorly lit, which made it difficult for them to see the girl,  , enter the water. Police sources said the incident took place between 7.30pm and 8pm after Tanya visited the club with her mother Geeta and two-year-old sister. 
 
 
  
 Cops said both Tanya and her sister entered the children’s pool while their mother was speaking on the phone. After some time, her sister returned without Tanya. Their mother raised an alarm and the swimming instructors who were busy training others in the large pool beside the one for children, too, began to look for her.
 
 The Gupta family said around 8pm, the pool staff noticed Tanya’s body floating in the large pool. They lifted her out and performed an emergency cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and then rushed her to a hospital where the doctor declared her as brought dead.
 
 Tanya’s father Ashok and her relatives blamed “inadequate safety measures at the pool” for the death. Relative Rohit Gupta said, “As there was insufficient lighting, no one saw Tanya enter the big pool.” Her father also alleged, “Our family was barred by security staff from seeing the CCTV footage of the pool area to find when Tanya entered it.”
 
 In a statement,   said, “This is an extremely unfortunate incident. Our deepest condolences to the family for their loss. The clubhouse and the buildings around have been operational for more than five years now. All our pools are less than or equal to four feet in depth and have clear safety signage, following international standards. The residents have entrusted PCMA to run the operations on their behalf and the team has always adhered to policies and educated residents on the same.”
