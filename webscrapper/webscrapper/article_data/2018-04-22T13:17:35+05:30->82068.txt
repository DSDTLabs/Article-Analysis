KOCHI: New institutions that have been added as centres for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test ( ) scheduled for May 6 will either have to borrow or hire metal detectors from security agencies or the police. If not, they will have to buy the device by paying Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000. The circular informed that   will reimburse Rs 100 for each detector. 

 The circular states that NEET is the 'highest sensitive examination' and hence it was important for centres to ensure that students do not engage in unfair practices using modern communication devices.
 
 Earlier this year, Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar said that there would be 43 new centres for the medical entrance exam. Five of them are in Kerala and they are Alappuzha, Kollam, Kottayam, Malappuram, and  .
 
 "As candidates hide communication devices in their clothes, CBSE has sought the use of metal detectors. However, this year many new cities have been added to conduct NEET-UG 2018. These cities will not be having metal detectors with them," read the circular issued by CBSE on April 18. So, new centres were told to hire metal detectors from a local security agency or local police. Schools were told to consider buying as it would serve as a one-time investment that would be useful in future.
 
 According to CBSE norms, there must be one metal detector for 100 candidates. A school where 600 students write the exam would hence need to spend at least Rs 6,000 for a metal detector while the CBSE refund would be only Rs 600.
 
 President of Kerala CBSE   TPM   said that though some schools might find it difficult to follow the circular, he had instructed them to procure the detector to protect the sanctity of the exam.
 
 He said that the addition of new centres would help reduce the travel problems faced by students from across the state who had to travel to Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Kannur, Thrissur and Trivandrum to give the examination.
