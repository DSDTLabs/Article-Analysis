LUCKNOW: Rush for food from bhandaras on the second Bada   led to massive traffic jams on several busy stretches and in markets such as Bhootnath, Aliganj, Patrakarpuram and Hanuman Setu.

 While prasad stalls and temples saw long queues of people and illegally parked vehicles disrupting traffic, poor monitoring by   also led to severe littering. 
 
 Hanuman Setu, the most revered Hanuman temple, sees traffic jams frequently due to Metro construction. On Bada Mangal, the situation got more chaotic as queues of people formed. 
 
 The area saw many people throwing plastic waste on the ground instead of in dustbins.

 As a rule, LMC has mandated all stall organisers to place dustbins at distribution points. However, many organisers do not bother to install dustbins. At most places, all plastic waste and food waste was dumped on roads. 
 
  Kapoorthala junction was full of disposable glasses. Haphazardly parked vehicles were causing traffic jams. An organizer said, "We usually hire sweepers for Rs 50 to clean up. LMC sweepers only come in the evening or the next morning. Water is also managed by us. The temple nearby let us use its water tank." 
 
 The rule also says that all organisers need to register with LMC in advance so that it can coordinate with them for waste management. However, due to poor monitoring by LMC, only a few organisers register with it. Despite registration, many of them do not have dustbins. 
 
 On Rana Pratap Marg, lack of dustbins was evident as the entire area was littered. Disposable plates and glasses scattered around because of the winds. A stall organiser in Aminabad pointed out that even if they get dustbins, they get full very quickly due to such a large number of people. 
 
 "LMC workers don't clean round the clock, so, dustbins remain full and people throw garbage on the roads," he said.
