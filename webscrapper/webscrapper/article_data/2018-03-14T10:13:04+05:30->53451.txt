HYDERABAD: In a significant development that is likely to heighten the political heat in Andhra Pradesh, the Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday issued notices to 22 turncoat MLAs who were elected on the YSRCP ticket and switched loyalties to the TDP without relinquishing their MLA posts.

 Interestingly, four of these legislators are currently ministers in the Chandrababu Naidu cabinet. The Bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi gave these notices before admitting a public interest petition filed by former MLA Anna   of   in Prakasam district, who was seeking disqualification of all the turncoat legislators under the provisions of the anti-defection law.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The Bench also gave notices to the secretaries of AP Assembly secretariat and law department. Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel CV   told the court that the defectors were mocking at the system as it was not acting against them. He said that the system should not remain silent when opposition party MLAs become ministers in the ruling party. He also raised a grievance saying that scores of pleas against these defectors are lying unattended by the AP Assembly Speaker and the courts too were not coming to the rescue of the system.
 
 The   said that the high court is beset with huge pendency of 3.25 lakh cases and, in addition to this, every day 5,000 new cases are getting added to the list. However, it sought to know from Mohan Reddy, who had earlier worked as APâ€™s advocate general, whether he was seeing these defections and the consequent brazen behaviours happening for the first time. The former   said that he was fortunate enough that he never came across an embarrassing situation where as the AG he was forced to defend a minister-cum-defector. The case was posted to two weeks.
