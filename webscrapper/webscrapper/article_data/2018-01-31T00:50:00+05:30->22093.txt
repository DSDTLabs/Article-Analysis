Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday directed the Tamil Nadu government to file a status report before it on February 16 in a case relating to the recovery of unlicensed pistols from Chennai and Trichy recently.

 The court also directed both the central and state governments to be very vigilant in the issue by saying that movements of pistols will create havoc in the country. Advocate K Karmegam filed a public interest litigation which came up for admission before the division bench headed by justice N Kirubakaran.
 
 The petitioner said that recently police arrested two people and recovered unlicensed pistols from them in Chennai and Trichy. Police investigation revealed that they sold many unlicensed arms to some people including politicians, businessmen and advocates in Chennai, Coimbatore and Tirupur districts and were involved in the trade for the past few years. Besides, some police constables were involved in it. However, police did not disclose the names of people who purchased the illegal arms.
 
 Besides, the recovery showed that sale of illegal arms is taking place in the country. The state police could not make an impartial and full-fledged investigation in the issue.
