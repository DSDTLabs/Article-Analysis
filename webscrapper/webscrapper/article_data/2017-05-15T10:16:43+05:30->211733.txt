KOLHAPUR: The civic body has issued a show-cause notice to the   firm of Kalammawadi Direct   Project, seeking detailed response over several allegations levelled by the corporators.

 The notice was issued on Saturday and the consultancy firm,  , has been given seven days to reply. The   (KMC) has decided to re-work the estimates of the Rs 488 crore project after the corporators pointed out flaws in the DPR and tender documents.
 
 A senior official of the KMC, requesting anonymity, said, “Based on the reply of the consultant, the liability of the mistake taken place will be fixed. Also another report will be drafted that will be submitted to the state government for further enquiry. We have already decided to re-work the cost of each work proposed in the project. At present, works of Rs 170 crore has been completed and the bills issued for the same will also be scrutinised.”
 
 Mahesh Pathak, director of the consultancy firm, recently accepted that mistake has happened. The corporators had alleged that the bills worth Rs 2.2 crore have been issued for the work which costs not more than Rs 25 lakh.
 
 The consultant had claimed that the bills in lump sum amount were released by the KMC. The civic authorities have now decided to issue separate bills for each work mention in the project. The cost of the project was Rs 424 crore when it was sanctioned by the Central government. After re-working the estimates in 2015, the cost went up to Rs 488 crore.
 
 “We have ruled out the fear of escalating cost of the project after re-working the estimates. We will ensure that faulty estimation of the works included in the project will be corrected and in such situation the cost of the project may come down,” said the official.
