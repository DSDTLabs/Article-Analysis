PATNA: Faced with the opposition charge that all’s not well in the ruling grand alliance, CM   on Monday held first ‘Karyakarta darbar mein mantriparishad’ (full cabinet in workers’ durbar) programme at the CM residence.
 
  Besides the cabinet ministers, all grand alliance leaders, including   president  , former JD (U) president   and state   president Ashok Choudhary, attended the event at which the CM and his cabinet colleagues heard the grievances of district presidents of JD (U), RJD and Congress for several hours.
  
  Most of them complained about their neglect by government officials. Complaints regarding people’s problems are not taken up seriously by them, the CM was told.
  
  Some others sought formation of different committees at the district and block levels and accommodation of active workers in these committees.
  
  “It is an initiative to ensure coordination among the workers of three parties at district and lower levels. Block and panchayat level workers will be given similar opportunity in next meetings,” Lalu later told reporters.
  
  He said a darbar for the workers would be held on every fourth Monday.
