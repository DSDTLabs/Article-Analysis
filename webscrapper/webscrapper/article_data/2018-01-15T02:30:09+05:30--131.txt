MUMBAI: Where are our roads and footpaths? A question probably every Mumbaikar is asking today. But some   residents decided to go around their area, documenting the condition of every road, including internal ones in JVPD Scheme. Not surprisingly, each road had some flaw.

 After noticing a steady decline in the condition of roads in their area,   documented the situation at every road where they noticed some crater, bumpy patch or corrosion. Architect Samarth Das, who went around documenting them, said they covered arterial roads like S V Road and C D  , and internal roads. “It’s frustrating to see how every road is uneven when one is driving through. Over time, we have started becoming increasingly passive towards road conditions in Mumbai. Most roads documented do not look like they even belong to a city. These are certain basic amenities one expects from a city like Mumbai,” said Das.
 
 The   has also written to the civic authorities demanding that they work towards their suggestions. Group chairman   said, “We want other resident groups to take up similar initiatives so that tomorrow, when the authorities tell us that a road is in good condition, we can show them how pictures speak another story.” Group members pointed out how it had become a standard practice that well-made roads are constantly dug up, albeit for necessary reasons, and then left in a shoddy state as the excavated material and debris are dumped back. They also pointed to innumerable accidents due to the sub-standard and unacceptable condition of roads.
 
 Architect   said the documentation, through pictures, brings out how every road is damaged even when there is no question of a shortage of funds for the civic authorities.
