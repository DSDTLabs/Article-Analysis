PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A few days ago, Bopkhel resident Vikas Takalkar (26) passed away after suffering a heart attack even as he was being rushed to Vishrantwadi. The youth’s death has turned into a bitter reminder of the missing bridge over Mula river that used to be a convenient connection to Khadki until a year ago.

 The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) continues to await a permission to begin constructing a permanent bridge. The civic body has forwarded a   of the bridge to the Southern Command, which approved it and sent to the ministry of defence for its go-ahead.
 
 Meanwhile, Takalkar isn’t the only casualty of the long wait. In January, 48-year-old   died when he suffered a heart attack and could not reach the hospital in time. In November 2016, Yogesh Dalvi (32) died when he could not be taken to the hospital for treatment after he too suffered a similar fate. Bopkhel resident Santosh Ghule, who was to start a hunger strike at   in Pimpri on Friday, said, “If the temporary bridge had been in place, we could have taken these youths to Khadki for treatment within 10 to 15 minutes. It would have saved their lives.” 
 
 Ghule had gone on a hunger strike in November last year as well. He said, “We met the civic chief Shravan Hardikar two days ago. He said he would need a week to find a solution to the problem.” 
 
 For now, the residents have agreed to hold back on Hardikar’s request. “We will wait till Wednesday. If no solution is found until then, we will start the hunger strike on Friday.”
 
 A civic official said, “The Southern Command has okayed the design for the permanent bridge and sent it for final approval to the  .”
