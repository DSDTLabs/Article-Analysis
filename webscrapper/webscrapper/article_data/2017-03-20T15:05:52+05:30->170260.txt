Vidya Balan, who is known for her heavy duty roles, will stun us with her upcoming film ' ', where she will be seeing handling loaded ammo like a pro. The actress, who essays the title role played by   in the original Bengali film, 'Rajkahini', transformed herself to play a brothel madam in director  's Hindi adaptation that releases next month. 

 The feisty actress pulled all stops to play the badass head of the brothel, located bang in the middle of the newly-designated line of control between India and Pakistan in the post-Independence era. Vidya not only made herself comfortable with mouthing cuss words, but also learnt to use hefty rifles and ride a horse for the action sequences in the climax. A room was allocated at Vishesh Films’ office for the women to learn to load, unload and handle the gun while they practiced firing with fake bullets on the set in Jharkhand. 
 
 Srijit recalls, “Vidya and the other girls had to fire those old rifles for the climax sequence. They had to run and even ride horses while armed. So, all of them had to appear comfortable while wielding the guns. They were heavy but the ladies, especially Vidya, did a great a job handling them. All this with just 10 days of prep work. Normally, a workshop doesn’t entail such heavy duty physical tasks but when I told Vidya that she had to get familiar with a gun, she was totally game for it.”
