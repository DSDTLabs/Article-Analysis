KOCHI: Showrooms selling imported bicycles and other stores ushered in the culture of bicycle rallies and marathons in the state, according to a club official here.

 
 “The store and showroom owners started short-distance cycle rallies. People were initially persuaded into participating in such events, which later led to serious group cycling and marathons in the state,” Shagzil Khan, president of   ( ), said.
 
 Later, as the number of cyclists increased, clubs were formed, bringing cyclists together, and planning and mapping the routes.
 
 “Till a few years ago, there were around eight clubs in the country, which now have gone up to 48. The distances covered, too, have increased. Many clubs are now affiliated to Paris-based  , and its Indian arm Audax India Randonneurs, conducting 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1,000-km rides. Those successfully completing the marathon win the Super Randonneur status,” Rajith Rathiyappan, who heads To & Fro Bicycles Club in Kochi, said.
 
 Mapping and charting of roads for marathons are one of the primary tasks of the clubs, apart from preparing the participants.
 
 “We are also planning a training class for women to provide them the knowhow to fix punctures and make technical corrections as well as to build confidence,” Khan said.
 
 CBC on Sunday—the WorldBicycleDay.—organized a 50-km ride in the city. The event saw the participation of Kerala Tourism, India Tourism and Kerala Police.
