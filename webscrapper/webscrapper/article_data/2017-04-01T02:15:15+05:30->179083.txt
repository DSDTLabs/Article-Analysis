MUMBAI: Inspired by the campaign to give up LPG subsidy, a Class XI student from the city is urging girl students to give up their junior college fee concession. 

 Her campaign won appreciation from human resource development minister   and school education minister Vinod Tawde on Friday.
 
 Uurja Bharatiya, an FYJC student at  , has started a Facebook page to urge her classmates to not avail of a concession if they can afford to pay the full fee. 
 
 “The fees is only Rs 500 for the year. We get a concession and need to pay only about Rs 200,” she said. The student had written to her college last year, expressing her desire to forego the concession. “But, the year was already through. I want to pay full fees from next year. The government might be able to put the money to better use,” said the   resident.
 
 Jawadekar tweeted on Friday: “Appreciate the gesture of  , @RuiaCollege student for giving up girls’ concession as her family can afford full fee.#GiveItUp.”
