If you are a sportsman and waiting to score some brownie points or two in a love match, here are some athletic lines to help you floor your love interest. If they sound cheesy, so be it. It’s Valentine’s Day, after all…

 
 Footballers are toughies, who have a reputation to live up to. So, take the girl aside, look deep into her eyes and say in that bass tone — ‘You are the reason for my self-goal.’
 
 
 If you are a Viswanathan Anand in the making, try testing the waters with a mysteriously whispered aside, ‘I love to chase the queen.’ If that seems to work, ‘It’s 
 checkmate’ may just set the mood for things to come. 
 
 
 Tennis players are nothing if not supple and immensely suave. So, after a rigorous set, take that love interest out for an energy drink. Wear your most innocent charm as you tilt your head and ask, ‘Is it a love all?’
 
 
 
 Toughest of punches can’t come to your defence when Cupid strikes. So, boxer boy, just remove your gloves and confess — ‘I’m knocked out!’ It never fails. 
 
 
 
 Even the heavyweight champs have been known to fall for the charms of petite damsels. And if you are still thinking how to voice your feelings, just stand in front of her like a Lion King and say, ‘How about a freestyle bout between your heart and mine?’
 
 
 
 Cricketers have it easy. Usually, ‘I’m the man in your gully’ would break the ice. If the girl smiles, no harm in getting bold and whispering — ‘I’m stumped’ in her ears. And let the music play.
