Actress Anna   says she and her husband   live a normal and simple life like anyone else in this world. The couple, who have a four-year-old son   together, prefer to lead a very low-key life away from the spotlight.

  
  
 "Chris loves to work in the garage and I love to do laundry and watch reality television. Just normal people," Faris said. However, the actress admits it can be 'tricky' to find a balance between being part of a famous couple and trying to lead a quiet family life. 
 
 "I don't think that's something, when you're an actor, that you're prepared for. There are two different roles that you play -- the one on-camera and the one in public. That's the tricky part," she said.
