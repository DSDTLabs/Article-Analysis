LUCKNOW: A day after he administered an oath of cleanliness to the staff of   (UPPCL), energy minister   wielded a broom and got down to ‘work’ on Friday afternoon. Sharma swept a section of the building’s corridor, piling up a heap of garbage even as UPPCL top brass, including principal secretary (energy)  , looked on in utter embarrassment.

 Even before the officials could react, Sharma picked up the garbage with bare hands and lobbed it in a bin. The minister then walked into a record room, pulled out a cloth and started wiping some of the dust-laden files. “Aap sab safai ka dhyan rakhein...main 15 din baad phir dekhunga (You must be careful about cleanliness, I will check again in 15 days),” warned the Mathura MLA and   national spokesperson as the UPPCL staff nodded in dismay.
 
 By the time the staff could understand what was happening around them, Sharma walked out briskly and summoned the officers to a meeting room. A discussion around energy supply and its distribution followed. 
 
 “We need to ensure separate feeders so that power load is addressed and there is no tripping,” Sharma thundered.
 
 He directed the energy department to ensure that the state becomes a signatory for the Centre’s ambitious ‘power for all’ project by April 15.
