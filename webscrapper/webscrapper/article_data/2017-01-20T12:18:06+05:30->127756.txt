Experiencing   is not uncommon. Sometimes touching a doorknob, a chair or another person may give us a light electric jerk. But why do we feel this electric discharge? Let’s uncover this mystery. 

 
 
 
 Everything you see around is made up of the defining structure of elements called  . They cannot be seen through the naked eyes and contain positively charged protons, negatively charged   and neutral neutrons. Most of the time, an atom remains neutral, that means same number of protons and electrons. But when an atom has   in odd numbers, electrons get excited. Protons and neutrons don’t move around, and mostly it is the electrons that tend to bounce. So, when a person or any object has extra electrons, it creates a negative charge. These electrons thus get attracted to positive electrons (as opposite attracts) of another object or person and vice versa. The shock that we feel sometimes is the result of the quick movement of these electrons. 
 
 
 
 
 Yes, electric charge are formed most commonly in winters or when the climate around us is dry. The air becomes dry and electrons easily develop on the surface of our skin. During summer, the air moisture eradicates the negatively charged electrons and we rarely feel electric charge. 
 
 
 
 
 The electrons don’t stick around, rather as soon as they get a way out, they escape. For instance, if electrons in our body are too high in number, as soon as we come in contact with positively charged object, electrons get their way out leaving us in trap. In this process, we are so highly charged that even when we are inch apart, it breaks down the air particles and causes sudden shock. 
 
 The spark causes pain as it is hot and feels like a needle drilling into the skin.
