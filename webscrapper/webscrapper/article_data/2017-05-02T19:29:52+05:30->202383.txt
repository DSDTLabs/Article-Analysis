JAIPUR: The poor   of Sanwada gram panchayat’s Dhuan village have to walk a long way to fetch water these days. 

 There are six handpumps in the village, but only two of them yield water. 
 
 What water can be got from these handpumps is not sufficient for all the villagers, and many are forced to trudge in hot sun for about a km to fetch water.
 
 Dhanji, a villager, said it is hard enough to find water for people – how will they get enough water for cattle? Although villagers have approached the sarpanch and asked him to find a solution to their water troubles, nothing has yet been done. 
 
 Development officer of the area Dinesh Kumar Mishra said tankers would be arranged for the villagers as an interim measure, until handpumps are repaired.
