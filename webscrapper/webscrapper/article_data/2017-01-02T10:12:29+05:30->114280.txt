RAJKOT: Figures can sometimes paint a completely different picture. In the ongoing   season, Mumbai pacer   had only 17 wickets in eight innings to show for his efforts before heading into Mumbai's semi-final clash against Tamil Nadu. On Day One, he picked up the important wickets of   (64) and   (16) to bring Mumbai right back in the match and take his season's tally to 19. 

 For an India hopeful, who has also toured the West Indies and has played India 'A' games in Australia, these figures cut a sorry picture. He is not even in the list of top wicket takers. But everyone who has seen him bowl will swear by his commitment and the effort he has put in. He has steamed in and bent his back each time he has played. Most of the times, he has bowled on flat tracks. In the absence of  , Thakur has done the job of spearheading Mumbai's attack admirably.
 
 "I wouldn't say that I am totally happy with how it's turned out for me this season but my efforts are there. I am happy that I have given it my all. I try and express myself and try to win games. I feel results are always byproducts of your efforts," he said after the day's play on Sunday.
 
 When wickets don't come despite bowling well, players often tend to change things needlessly or try too hard. Thakur is doing nothing of that sort. "If I look back at previous games, we played places like Mysore and Hubli which were dull pitches. Even there, I had my chances but there were a few decisions which could have gone either way. I got a couple of wickets at the top and I didn't really bowl to the tail, so if you look at the wickets column, it's always going to be one-two-or three wickets.
 
 "The important thing is that I haven't changed anything going into the season. After three good seasons there would be a season where I may not pick up as many wickets as before. But I keep bowling in the channel day in and day out. That's what matters," he said.
