NAVI MUMBAI: The   ( ) has decided to start a mass movement in rural areas to restart  . Animal rights groups are opposing the move on the grounds of animal cruelty. 

 The Supreme Court had banned bullock-cart racing in Maharashtra in 2014.
 
 On Tuesday, PWP leader Jayant Patil told TOI: “Bullock-cart racing is an inherent part of our state culture. That is why the members of my party recently met to start a people’s movement and pressure the state government to resume these traditional races.” 
 
 He added that they will initiate the mass movement in Raigad district, where there are around 12,000 bulls fit enough to run the races.
 
 When informed that animal rights groups, including PETA India, is opposed to their move seeking to lift the ban on bullock-cart racing in the state, Patil argued, “With that logic, animal activists must also ban horse racing at Malalaxmi Race Course.”
 
 Activist Manilal Valliyate of PETA India said any ‘so-called culture’ that involves cruelty to living beings must be abolished. “PETA India has documented that bulls race because their handlers hit them with nail-studded sticks and push beyond the point of exhaustion, which is in violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960.” 
 
 Raigad-based political observers feel that the timing of PWP seeking to restart bullock-cart races may be to gain popularity among the rural masses and get an advantage in the forthcoming polls.
 
 Taking cue from the mounting protests in Tamil Nadu in support of Jallikattu, last week, the Shiv Sena unit in Pune had demanded that chief minister Devendra Fadnavis seek a President’s ordinance to lift the   on bullock-cart racing in Maharashtra.
