A 41-year-old man from Rajkot killed his six-yearold nephew to garner   from whom he had borrowed Rs 3.60 lakh to set up his business.   Makwana smothered   to death on the terrace of their house by pressing the boy’s nose and mouth with a handkerchief. The incident took place 11 days ago and was detected on Sunday after the accused’s fingerprint matched with those on the surfaces examined by the investigating cops.
 
  
 
  
 According to police sources, Jignesh, his wife, son, and daughter (9) lived with his brother  , 35, wife Dimple and their only son, Rohan at   on Nana Mahuva Road. Jignesh did not succeed in his business while his younger brother did and was earning well for the family. On March 20, Rohan went suddenly missing. 
 
 After the family’s searched for the boy did not yield any result, they informed   police about it. Interestingly though, it was Jignesh who sounded most concerned about his nephew gone missing. A few hours after the incident, Rohan’s mother heard their dog barking at the terrace. When she went upstairs she found Rohan lying unconscious. However, when taken to a hospital nearby, the doctors declared that he had died a couple of hours ago.
  
  
 
  
 The needle of suspicion pointed towards Jignesh because he suddenly went quiet, said sources. After he was grilled by the cops for two days, he confessed to having murdered Rohan. He decided to carry out the cruel act after he received a call on his cellphone from a moneylender, asking him to return the money borrowed.
 
 When he was attending that call, Rohan came up to the terrace to feed biscuits to their dog. Jignesh thought that if he killed the boy, he would get some sympathy from the moneylenders. So, he smothered Rohan to death and pretended he had no clue where the boy was. He even joined the family in the search for the boy and also had dinner with them. Police Inspector   of Malaviya Nagar police station said murder charges have been registered against Jignesh.
