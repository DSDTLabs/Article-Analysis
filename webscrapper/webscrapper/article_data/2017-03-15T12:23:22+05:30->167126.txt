Vasu tells Dhruv about the truth behind Shraddha and Sankara. Dhruv is high on bhaang and laughs it off. Vasu thinks Dhruv is drunk and it is a good time to unite Bihaan and Thapki.
 
  Sankara goes to Thapki and asks her to apply color on her. Thapki does the same. She hugs Thapki and tears her clothes. Thapki is shocked.
  
  Everyone is playing Holi when Shraddha throws black color on Sankara's face. Kids laugh at her.
  
  Bihaan is washing his face when he gets flashes of Thapki. Thapki is still stuck in pool when Bihaan comes and saver her. They apply color on each other.
  
  Sankara comes home happily telling everyone that pandit ji has taken out the date for her and Bihaan's marriage.
