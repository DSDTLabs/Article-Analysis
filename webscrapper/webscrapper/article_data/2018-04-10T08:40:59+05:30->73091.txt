BENGALURU: Wildlife activists have demanded that forest department personnel and vehicles be exempted from election work, fearing that lack of patrol vehicles and field staff would only expose tigers and other endangered species to poachers.

 In a letter to the chief electoral officer, Karnataka, Praveen Bhargav, a former member of  , has said that withdrawal of staffers and/ or patrolling vehicles would weaken the already stretched protection infrastructure and deplete field formations.
 
 “You may be aware that the   (ECI) has repeatedly issued orders exempting vehicles and staffers of national parks, sanctuaries and tiger reserves across the country from election duties. The same needs to be followed. This is important since tigers and other endangered species are under serious threat of being hunted by organized criminal networks,” reads the letter, a copy of which is with TOI.
 
 Bhargav, who is also the managing trustee of Wildlife First, an NGO, said during summer, forests need to be protected from arsonists who set off forest fires and destroy wildlife habitat. “Also, the forest department needs to continuously carry out patrolling and maintain anti-poaching camps in inaccessible interior forest areas,” he added.
 
 The letter also cited the compendium of instructions on conduct of elections issued by the ECI in 1999, which clearly states that vehicles and staffers of wildlife sanctuaries and national sanctuaries should not be requisitioned for election duty.
