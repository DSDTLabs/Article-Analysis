MIDNAPORE: A city doctor has been found guilty of  , leading to the death of a patient in  . A district consumer forum on Wednesday ordered gynaecologist Arup Laha to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the victim’s husband.

 “I will move a higher forum, challenging the order. The operation was successful. I left the hospital satisfied with the patient’s health. How am I responsible for the post-operative complications as I did not treat her thereafter?” asked Laha.
 
 In 2013, 26-year-old Mamata Hait was admitted to Daspur Annapurna Nursing Home for the delivery of her child. Laha carried out a C-section on her on May 3. Mamata’s husband Dilip alleged that Laha left the hospital after prescribing medicines but did not look into post-operative care. The next day, Mamata developed acute stomach pain and the medical officer at the nursing home advised Dilip to shift her elsewhere as they were not equipped to diagnose or treat her. Dilip took Mamata to  , where the doctors suggested she be admitted to a superspecialty hospital. Late on May 4, Mamata was admitted to   in Kolkata, where she died on May 8.
 
 The hospital put down the cause of her death to refractory shock and haematoma shock following an operation on May 3, 2013. Dr Sarmistha Samanta, who treated Mamata at Apollo, also testified before the consumer forum.
 
 Dilip lodged a complaint on May 9, 2013, following which a probe was started against Laha for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention. But the cops apparently found nothing against Laha and gave him a clean chit. Dilip then moved the consumer forum and another case was registered against Laha on June 10, 2014. The forum held him guilty on Wednesday.
