NEW DELHI: A gang of three men went amok in west Delhi, killing one and injuring several others. They wanted money to buy things and attacked street   on Tuesday. 

 The first of these occurred in Vikaspuri where a 25-year-old youth was stabbed to death when he resisted a robbery bid. The victim, Ravinder Yadav, was on his way to a market to buy vegetables when three men came on a mini scooter and attacked Yadav. 
 
 Later, one of the assailants named Baljeet was arrested. Yadav was from Bihar and lived in Budhela village near Vikaspuri. 
 
 Yadav was stabbed in the thigh for resisting the robbery bid. He later died due to excessive blood loss even though he was taken to Deen Dayal Upadyay Hospital. 
 
 But the assailants didn’t know it. They thought Yadav would survive. So they went to Tilak Nagar where they saw a group of three men pushing a vegetable cart. Just like the previous case, the assailants asked the victim, Ajay Singh, to hand over his phone. When he refused, he was stabbed too. In fact, the snatchers robbed two other people, Feku Mehto and Sunil Kumar Gupta, just 20 metres apart on this stretch. Singh and the others were admitted to   and later discharged. 
 
 The third incident occurred in Rajouri Garden where the men next headed and attacked a group of five vegetable sellers. Kishan Singh, Kishan and Udai Singh were the victims this time. When they were attacked with knives and pistol butts, they cried for help. At this two other sellers, Gautam and Kali Charan, intervened only to be attacked themselves. The attackers took away Rs 20,000 from all of them and their phones. 
 
 Baljeet later told the police that they targeted vendors thinking they wouldn’t retaliate. Police are looking for the other two.
