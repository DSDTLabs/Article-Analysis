PANAJI: At any level in football, Germany will always be the team to beat. The World champions are now officially the top-ranked team in the world ­ surpassing   at the top of the ladder ­ and will naturally instil fear in the minds of their opponents at the Fifa U-17 World Cup in India next month.

 Group opponents   know what they are up against in their opening match of the tournament on October 7 in Goa but head coach   knows his team is more than capable of surprising the European giants.
 
 "Whenever you play Germany at any level of football, it's a game with a lot riding on it. We have to be careful in our approach and prepare well. We know the importance of starting a campaign against a team of the quality of Germany. This can make a big impact as they are a strong team, but I think we have prepared well mentally and emotionally to handle this game," Camacho told TOI.
 
 The most successful team in  , Costa Rica have been part of the U-17 World Cup on 10 occasions and put up an impressive showing at the last tournament in Chile. They defeated France on penalties to win a knockout game for the first time, before bowing out to Belgium in last eight. "The last edition in Chile was very good. Our objective this time is to try and improve on that performance. However, we do know that each tournament that we participate in is different and come with their own challenges," said Camacho.
 
 "For us, whenever we enter a tournament, we do try and finish first. We have spoken about taking it one step at a time but our expectations are high and we want to go as far as possible," said Camacho.
