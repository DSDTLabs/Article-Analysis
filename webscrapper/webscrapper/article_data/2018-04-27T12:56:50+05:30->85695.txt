KUSHINAGAR: When Harihar Prasad was seeing off his three grandchildren to school on Thursday morning, little did he know that it would be the last time he would see them smiling ever. 

 His three grandchildren - Ravi (11), Santosh (10) and Ragini (7) - were among the 13 children who died when their school van was hit by a train at Behpurva unmanned level crossing, under the limits of   police station, in   on Thursday. 
 
 "In the morning, Santosh and Ragini said they did not want to go school but we sent them, and lost them," wailed the distraught grandfather.
 
 "My grandsons and granddaughter will never return now. How will I live without them? I don't know how my son and daughter-in-law will survive without them. We lost everything. Before leaving for school today, they waved and smiled at us from the school van," said Harihar Prasad, a resident of   village of Dudahi area. Prasad's son   is representative of the village head and his three children studied at Divine Mission School. Ravi, Santosh and Ragini died on the spot.
