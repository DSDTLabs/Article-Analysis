It seems like the trend of horror films is catching up in Mollywood too. While last year had actors such as Prithviraj leading from the front,   and   will be seen in this year’s first attempt at the genre with a movie titled  .

 The horror-comedy is directed by  , who has been in the film industry for a decade and has worked as an associate director with Kamal, Joshiy and Madhupal. On the movie, he says, “Our primary aim is to scare the living daylights out of the audience and make it one of the top horror films in Malayalam. The humour element comes naturally with the story; it goes hand in hand with the plot.”
 
 Mamta plays a speech therapist in the movie, he says. “Her character is a widow and has a six-year-old daughter. Mamta is the heart and soul of the movie and the entire story evolves through her character. Anoop Menon plays a paranormal investigator and how he along with the characters of Baburaj, Sreekumar Marimayam and Sinil Sainudeen join Mamta for a common goal is what the movie is all about,” says Althaf, who had also directed the popular short film titled Thorthu.
 
 The film, which will be entirely shot in Thrissur, is scripted by Riyas Marath and Muneer Mohammed, who had written the dialogues and screenplay for Sapthamashree Thaskaraha. While title of the movie bears similarity to the 1979 horror-drama Kalliyankattu Neeli, Althaf says, “Our film’s story is set in a village called Kalliyankattu; that’s where the connection begins and ends.”
