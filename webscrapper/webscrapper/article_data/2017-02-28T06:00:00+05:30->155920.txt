It took 10 children to sweep the audience off their feet at a venue in   off their feet with an overdose of cuteness. The children who were a part of Samahaara Children’s Theatre Workshop, delighted the crowd with perhaps their first stage performance, an adaptation of Ruskin Bond’s Blue Umbrella. The story set in a Himalayan village is centred around the   of Binya, Chiniya and Miniya that soon becomes a talk of the village and attracts the covetous eyes of a village shopkeeper, Ram Bharosa who wants to own it by hook or by crook. And despite a few slip-ups, some forgotten lines, and small mistakes in coordination, the audience were highly impressed by what they had presented.
