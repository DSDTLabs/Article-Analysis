AHMEDABAD: Following reports of a stray cow on the   runway causing two flights to be diverted to Mumbai and delaying many others, a study by the Gujarat   (GEER) revealed that the operations area of the airport is home to at least 36 species of birds,  ,  ,  

 A recent report by the Gujarat Ecological Education and Research Foundation (GEER) revealed that the migratory rosy starlings, seem to have made the area home with more than 5,000 birds being found in the area, the highest number ever recorded. Rosy starlings are followed by black kites, of which 48 were found in the operations area.
 
 
  
 The study recorded that the number of rosy starlings recorded was higher than in the 2015 and 2017 surveys. The report stated that in August 2017, some 5,199 birds of 36 species were found including 48 kites and more than 5,000 rosy starlings. In August 2015, the survey had found 788 birds of 55 species including 102 kites and just only 26 rosy starlings.
 
 Apart from the birds, the study found that the presence of insect species which attract this birds was on the rise and this was probably because of the grass on the operations area. 
 
 The study also revealed an alarming rise in individual insects of different species at the airport. In a 5mx5m sample area, the study found 1,160 insects of 48 species in August 2017, against 690 individual insects of 32 species found in 2015. The survey also found that a large number of grasshoppers were observed in a section of the operations area and these were eaten by rosy starlings.
 
 The report suggested that the use of artificial grass or a turf cover instead of natural grass cover should be explored. Artificial grass is much safer for airports than natural grass cover because it does not have nutrients and water and in turn, does not facilitate the growth and proliferation of insects, rodents and reptiles which attract birds.
