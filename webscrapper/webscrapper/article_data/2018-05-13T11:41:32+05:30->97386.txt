CHENNAI: Questioning the “capacity” of a health officer to engage former Attorney General to argue his case in a petition challenging the CBI probe in gutka scam, DMK working president M K   on Saturday demanded that chief minister   order a vigilance probe against the officer.

 
 In a statement, the DMK leader also urged the CM to sack health minister   and DGP T K Rajendran for their alleged role in gutka scam. “The filing of an appeal by a health officer before the   by engaging senior advocate   has surprised all and given rise to doubts to people. It naturally leads to questions as to how the officer got so much money to engage a very senior advocate,” Stalin said, alleging that health minister and DGP had used the health officer as a “mask” to move the higher court to prevent CBI probe and cause delay.
 
 Stalin said the minister and police chief would continue to create bottlenecks for the gutka probe as long as they continued in power. “Either they should offer to quit or CM should remove them,” he said.
