LUCKNOW: Usually as the clock strikes 4 in the afternoon, it is time for senior police official to start heading back to their offices, following their post-lunch siesta. But Tuesday was different. A phone call from DGP headquarters made director general and additional director general rank police officials anxious.

 It was the first time they were slated to interact with chief minister   10 days after he took charge. And the outcome was not as expected. The 40-odd officials who reached the fifth floor of Lal Bahadur Shatri Bhawan (annexe building) at 6.30pm faced Yogi’s wrath for not delivering as per expectations of 22-crore population of Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “He was anguished by the way the department was running and held senior leadership responsible for not setting precedents,” said an ADG.
 
 Yogi was particularly upset with the way Gautam Buddh Nagar police dealt with the Manish Khari case. African students were bashed up by protesters near Pari Chowk, a busy intersection in Noida on Monday evening by a mob.
 
 Yogi had come to the meeting well armed with data and cited examples of extortion from businessmen in eastern UP districts. He also named some SHOs and SOs posted in Gorakhpur who shielded criminals and corrupt activities. Yogi told police brass to take steps in order to restore confidence of the common man in khaki. He also questioned officials why tainted cops are not being taken to task despite regular complaints.
 
 He asked policemen to focus on fundamentals and improve vigil on the streets. Increased participation of female police personnel to protect women from harassment was another point Yogi highlighted. The meeting began at 7.10pm and ended up by 8pm with a clear message—perform or perish. The officials assured the chief minister that results will be visible over the next few days.
