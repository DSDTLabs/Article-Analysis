My daughter   is in Class III at Holy Child English Academy. As of now, she studies two languages, English and Hindi. I believe they are important because English is a global language and Hindi is her mother tongue. Adding   as a   is not required because she already has to study 11 subjects (science, moral science, GK, computer, mathematics, history, geography, English as well as Hindi literature and language).

 Moreover, making a regional language compulsory makes no sense because it is not known or spoken beyond  . I have nothing against Bengali but I would rather my daughter learns German or French or some other foreign language because it opens up a world of opportunities in India and abroad. 
 
 A lot of children may like to study Bengali but making it compulsory for everyone is unfair. As it is, children do not get time to play as they have to finish their homework and attend tuition classes. Making Bengali compulsory will only add to their misery. I also believe it is not necessary to study the literature of a local language when you only have to use the language to communicate with residents of the area. 
 
 No language should be made compulsory for children. It should be a choice so that they enjoy the subject. We live in a competitive world and it is important for children to excel in what they do. Having a lot of subjects or languages to study reduces a student’s efficiency. But if that effort is used to study a subject of one’s choice, it will be way more helpful in the long run. 
 
 Now, children are forced to take tuition in almost every subject from a very early age. If Bengali is added to the list, life will become troublesome for non-Bengali parents, who will have to send their children to one more class. It is also a matter of affordability. Education has become so expensive these days, the burden of yet another tuition might prove a bit too much.
