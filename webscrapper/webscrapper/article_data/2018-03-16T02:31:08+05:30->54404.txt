Navi Mumbai: A black   which could have suffered from a   stroke was nursed back to fitness by Uran-based activists.

 “The kite started sitting for long in the house of a villager in Dongri,   taluka. We reached the spot and started treating the bird,” said animal activist Jaywant Thakur. The kite was given water, vitamins and also small pieces of meat, Thakur added. 
 
 Due to the current heat conditions, the kite was suffering from dehydration. But the bird has recovered and ready to be released in the wild, said another bird lover  .
 
 The black kite is a medium-sized raptor (bird of prey). From a distance, it appears almost black with a light brown bar on the shoulder. The plumage is actually dark brown, with scattered light brown and rufous markings, particularly on the head, neck and underparts. The tail is forked and barred with darker brown. This gives the bird its alternative name of Fork-tailed Kite.
