PUNE: New security features on entering the airports are on the cards to   from entering the facilities with fake tickets.

 Officials in the   (BCAS) said the new instructions would come soon. But they declined commenting on introduction of e-ticket barcoding system.
 
 Two days after a person sneaked into the Pune airport’s terminal building by showing a fake e-ticket, the   personnel at the departure gate were seen closely checking the tickets of passengers on Tuesday. But an airport official iterated the Sunday’s incident was not a security breach under any circumstances.
 
 “The ticket of the youth sneaking into the airport on Sunday had a valid flight number and the name of the passenger was correct. Only the PNR was incorrect. The CISF person on duty at the gate checked the ticket details and allowed him to enter the building because he cannot verify the PNR number,” he said.
 
 If a passenger suddenly wants to leave after entering the terminal building, he or she is stopped by the CISF and the ticket is checked with the help of airlines’ officials. “The youth got caught at this juncture. It cannot be called a security breach under any circumstances,” the official told TOI.
 
 The CISF, meanwhile, is raising a Special Tactics Wing (STW) at the Officer’s Training Academy, Hyderabad, for tactical capacity building. “It will cater to the tactical needs of hypersensitive airports, Delhi metro rail and other such units. The officers will be trained to build an enhanced combat and tactical advantage against terrorist attacks and other similar threats. The wing will also train the sector-wise mobile tactical training teams so that the tactical fighting skills percolate down to the bottom,” Manjit Singh, the spokesperson of the CISF in Delhi, said.
