 Talking to media at her residence, Dr Shabistan claimed, “Dr Kafeel suffered a stroke on March 29 but he was not given proper treatment. The ex-principal of BRD Medical College, Dr  , is suffering from liver disease and diabetes, but he too is not getting proper medical attention. The principal’s wife, Dr  , suffered a hairline fracture. They all need treatment.”
