Delhi boy  , the winner of India’s Dancing Superstar, and his team can surprise anyone with their   moves on   and other desi songs. That is exactly the reason why the team was invited to perform on a US television show hosted by  . Showtime At The Apollo, which had been revived in 2016, will soon telecast Shraey and his team’s performance in its coming episodes. "We had uploaded our video, Indian Bollywood  , on YouTube as well as other social media handles. When the production team (of the show) saw that video, they wanted us to perform the same sequence for their show. In that video, we are dancing on a Telugu song and have added MJ’s moves. We had changed the choreography a bit but kept it majorly the same, as per their requirements. When we performed, neither we nor the audience could understand the song," says Shraey.

  He adds that the team went to the US in November and it was the biggest opportunity for them. "Our inspiration, Michael Jackson sir, had also performed on that same stage, so that actually meant a lot to us. We had never thought that we would be given this opportunity. It is a legendary stage on which artists like Prince and Beyonce have performed. When we were there, we also got to watch   and Snoop Dogg perform, and it was just unreal. We got a standing ovation from the audience - they were surprised to see that a group of young dancers from India can do MJ’s moves like that," says Shraey. 
 
  Talking about Steve Harvey, the host of the show, Shraey said that Steve told them their performance was his favourite. "We also spoke to him backstage before our performance. He was very funny and he tried pronouncing my name many times but he just could not (laughs). But we are overwhelmed with the response we got on the show," he shares.
