THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A group of people are waging a desperate battle to preserve their most treasured resource at a coastal village, hardly an hour's drive away from the state capital. Over the last few months, Athiyannur block panchayat, which was notified as over-exploited in terms groundwater usage by the   ( ) is struggling to cope with one of the most punishing   spells in decades.

 “We literally have to fight it out with the water mafia to keep some water for ourselves. Our wells have dried up and we don't know how our kids are going to sur vive here without water,'' says Rajan N, a resident. Every night, they take turns staying awake to make sure that they are not robbed of whatever little is left for them. Unauthorised water extraction continues to pose a threat despite a stop memo issued by the district collector.
 
 According to inspection reports of GWD, approximately 15-20 lakh litres of water used to be pumped out of Athiyannur to hotels, hospitals and apartments in the city and to Kovalam and Parassala from around 12 illegal pumping stations.
 
 Now the residents of Athiyannur peer down into their wells, hoping for a rise in water level.
 
 No aquifer yield test has been con ducted at Athiyannur, which has several geographical peculiarities. The low-lying area is marked by presence of fractured rocks and with a dip in water level, sea water could seep in, affecting water quality. “The undulating terrain of this area makes it impossible for natural recharge.We are now planning a project through which one well in each house would be recharged,“ said an official with the groundwater department.
 
 Athiyannur is one of the very few places in the state with submarine groundwater discharge. “If we could divert the flow for public use, it could resolve the problem to a large extent,'' the official said.
