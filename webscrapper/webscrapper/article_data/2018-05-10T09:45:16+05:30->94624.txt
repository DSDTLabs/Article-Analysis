PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Six sheep were killed and four suffered serious injuries in a leopard attack on Tuesday at Zendewadi village, along Hadapsar-Pandharpur road in  , prompting the forest department to install four cages there.

 The villagers claimed that four leopards comprising an adult male and a female leopard, and their two cubs attacked the sheep. But the forest department officials stated that the number of leopards involved in the attack would be known only after analysing the pugmarks and other information gathered from the spot.
 
 BP Jadhav, the sub-divisional forest officer of the Pune division, said, “The leopard attacked 12 sheep. Of them, six died and four are seriously injured. The injured are undergoing treatment at the government-run veterinary hospital at Saswad.”
 
 He said leopards were sighted at Devale village in Bhor taluka around three weeks ago. A hill separates it from Zendewadi.
 
 Babu Kokare, the affected shepherd, said, “We are nomads and take the sheep for grazing in surrounding areas. We keep all our sheep, around 350 to 400, in a net enclosure at night. My uncle, Namdev Kokare, was near the enclosure when a leopard came from a nearby stream towards him. The leopard charged at the sheep and they ran out. The dead sheep had injuries on their neck, stomach, head, ears and other parts of their bodies.”
 
 Anil Zende, a villager and a hotelier, said, “An ox tied in the cattle shed in the field also had scratch marks on its body”.
 
 Jayashree Jadhav, the range forest officer, said, “We have conducted the panchnama and a report will be sent to the higher authorities for the payment of compensation to the affected shepherd. The pugmarks have been found in the soil. Around 15 to 20 forest labourers are patrolling the areas near the spot of leopard attack.”
