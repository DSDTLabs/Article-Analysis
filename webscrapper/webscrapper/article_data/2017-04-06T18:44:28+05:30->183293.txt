NEW DELHI: With even the Union civil aviation minister not inclined to lift the 
  , it was left up to the  's senior colleague  , to lead the charge - both literally and figuratively - in his favour.

 Perhaps taking a cue from 
  himself, Geete, an MP from Maharashtra's Raigad constituency, and other Sena MPs, almost flung themselves on aviation minister Asok Gajapati Raju, after the latter made clear that passengers' safety is paramount, ANI reported.
 
 Considering Geete, Union minister of heavy industries and public enterprises, is Gajapati Raju's cabinet colleague, he will sure have some explaining to do in the coming days. Geet later denied any "misconduct'' occurred in Parliament.
 
 Gaikwad is accused of slapping an Air India crew member 25 times. Following the incident, all domestic airlines put him on a no-fly list.
 
 "We won't let airlines fly from Mumbai," Sena MPs were heard shouting amid the commotion. Air India is based in Mumbai.
 
 The situation was only defused after senior BJP leader SS Ahluwalia and home minister   intervened, ANI said. As Ahluwalia took the aviation minister to his chamber, rajnath "reasoned with" Geete, ANI said.
 
 What got the Sena MPs' collective goats was Gajapati Raju's comment that "Aircraft are machine on which people fly and safety is paramount which can never be compromised." 
 
 Lok Sabha Speaker   later held a meeting with the home minister, civil aviation minister, Geete and other   MPs, to try and defuse the situation.
 
 Later, Rajnath said the Gajapati Raju and the Shiv Sena MPs will look for an Ã¤micable resolution" to the ban issue.
