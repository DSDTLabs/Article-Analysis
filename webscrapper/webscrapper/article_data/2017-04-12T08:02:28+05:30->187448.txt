NEW DELHI:After the nomination of five   candidates was rejected by the state election commission, the party has decided to support Independent candidates. BJP alleged that the returning officers for the civic polls were working under pressure from the AAP-led government as its candidates were rejected on frivolous grounds.
The party will support Twinkle Kalia from Kishanganj, Amrita Rashmi from Baprola, Rahul Singh from Vinod Nagar, Gulfam from Abul Fazal Enclave and Lata Soni from Lado Sarai. Kalia runs a charitable ambulance service and Singh heads a society which provides financial assistance. BJP members said that all the candidates are social activists.
 
 BJP , however, got relief from HC when it overruled the rejection of its candidate from Trilokpuri as she had failed to tick on the gender column in the nomination form. “The seat was reserved for women, so it does not matter if the candidate failed to tick on the gender column,“ said a party member.
