Recently, 
 ’s wife,   hosted a beautiful pre-birthday bash for her darling husband. Many close friends and A-listers from the film fraternity were invited for the bash. However, 
  was missing from the party. Since the actress is Shahid’s co-star in ‘Rangoon’, her absence raised a few eyebrows.

  
  
 While she may not have been able to make it to the bash, she made it up to Mira with a sweet gesture. The ‘Rangoon’ actress reportedly wrote a letter to the star wife thanking her for inviting her to the celebration. Apparently,   further explained that she would not be able to attend the party as she will be caught up with some prior commitments in Delhi around that time. Isn’t that sweet of Kangana?
