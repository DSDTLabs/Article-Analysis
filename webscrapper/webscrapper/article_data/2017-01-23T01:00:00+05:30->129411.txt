 is back on TV after four years. Having lost around 18 kg, the original Prem in ' ' ('SSK') is looking leaner and fitter. Accepting the compliment with a smile, he says, “After quitting the show, I worked on my body. Dipika (Kakar, girlfriend) is very happy with the new me, as she was the one who pushed me 
to get fitter. I was on a no-sugar and no-carb diet. She would also eat the same boiled food as me.” 
 Terming ' ' as the best comeback, he adds, “I didn’t want to do a saas-bahu drama. This script is exactly what I wanted to take up. I struggled after quitting 'SSK', but I made the most of that time to attain a good body and fulfil my dream of working in a film.”
 Ask him about Dipika’s decision to quit 'SSK' and he replies, “I will always support her in all decisions that make her happy. My reason to quit the show was that I was dissatisfied as an actor. However, Dipika quit because she was physically drained out. It was not easy for her to quit after six years, because as an actor, you get emotionally attached to your show. Nevertheless, we are both happy with 
 our decision.” 
 They have been in a relationship for two years. So, when are they planning to tie the knot? “We plan to get married either in December this year or January next year. I would like to have a winter wedding. Dipika wants a grand nikaah in my hometown  ,” he signs off.
