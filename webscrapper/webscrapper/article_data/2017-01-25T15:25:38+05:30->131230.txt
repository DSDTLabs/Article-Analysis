NEW DELHI: Politician  , no stranger to offensive comments about women, believes the honour of a vote is more important than the honour of a woman, ANI reported today.

 "It is very important to educate people in a big way about how the ballot paper works. The honour of being able to cast a vote is a much bigger honour than your daughter's honour," he said in an address, ANI reported, along with a video of the   (U) politician's speech. 
 
 And Sharad Yadav didn't stop there - just in case anyone didn't understand what he meant.
 
 "If a daughter's honour is violated, her neighbourhood and her village lose their honour, but if a vote is sold, it is the country's honour that goes. All our dreams for the future evaporate," Yadav, who's a Rajya Sabha Parliamentarian said.
 
 It should come as no surprise that this is the same man who once told Union Minister  , " 
  "
 
 This is also the same man who used the august environs of   to wax eloquent about "the beauty of south Indian women".
 
 "Your god is dark like (Union minister)   (present in the House), but your matrimonial ads insist on white-skinned brides," he said, apropos of nothing, in the Rajya Sabha during a debate on the government's Insurance Bill. 
 
 Other Parliamentarians were left dumbstruck as Yadav made these comments. Some giggled, albeit nervously.
 
 A few days later, as Yadav attempted to explain 
  , Union minister Irani interrupted him to make a comment. It was a valid interruption, because Yadav, in attenpting to 'defend' himself, was being even more offensive.
 
 "I appeal to the gentleman (Yadav) not to make comments on colour of skin of women in this manner. Very wrong message is going," Irani said.
 
 That's when an infuriated Yadav - how dare a woman interrupt him - told Irani, "I know what you are."
