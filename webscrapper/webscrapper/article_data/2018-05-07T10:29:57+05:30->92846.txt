Actor-activist   and Gujarat MLA   held a joint press conference in Hubballi on Sunday and slammed BJP for failing to deliver on its promises. Rai questioned   on his assurance on the Mahadayi issue, while Mevani poked fun at UP ministers for having breakfast at Dalit homes only in election season.

 Rai said, “Fear of BJP workers is haunting me. My mother, wife and everyone at home is worried for my life. I have convinced them that I am right and can face fascist forces. Wherever I go and speak to people, BJP workers chase me, as in Kalaburagi recently.”
 
 
 Mevani said Modi was silent on the Dalit issue during the assembly elections in Gujarat, where atrocities on Dalits are rampant. “He should instruct UP ministers who have started drama of having breakfast at Dalits home. It’s an insult to Dalits as BJP workers are attacking, murdering Dailts in many parts of the nation” he said.
