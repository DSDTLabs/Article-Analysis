NEW DELHI:   on Sunday slammed the   government for filing a police case against the journalist who reported that Aadhar data was on sale from unscrupulous elements, warning that the Centre was shooting the messenger instead of reading the message.

 Dubbing the FIR as betraying BJP’s “arrogance of power”,   spokesman   said, “Intentions of the Modi government on privacy were thoroughly exposed when it had proclaimed that no citizen can have an absolute right over his body…. In the Supreme Court, the Modi government had accepted   data leak! Now instead of investigating, an evasive Modiji shoots the messenger!” 
 
 Intensifying the attack, AICC spokesperson Shobha Oza said, “The Unique Identity architecture was purely designed to create a right to obtain a unique identity, enrolment process for demographic and biometric information so that welfare schemes could be more inclusive and there were no leakages. But the Modi government’s sheer high-handedness and brazen attitude towards Aadhaar, coupled with an underlying motive to use the data for citizen surveillance, is defeating that very purpose.” 
 
 Oza said the government had fought in the SC against the right to privacy of citizens and the perils of making Aadhaar mandatory for every scheme were evident.
