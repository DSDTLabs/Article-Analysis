KOLKATA: The West Bengal Land Reforms and   (WBLRTT) finally allowed demolition of a building that was among four structures at the gateway of New Town which had been served raze notice on March 23.

 
 The order was issued for five buildings standing in the way of the New Garia-Airport   link at Salt Lake’s Mahishbathan. But the five-storey structure that houses a guest house called Megacity Inn couldn’t be demolished in the late-evening drive undertaken by Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation on March 29 because the owner had moved WBLRTT.
 
  executive director   told 
  on Wednesday: “I have heard that the honourable tribunal has ordered in favour of the demolition of Megacity Inn. I request the state to start razing the structure immediately, so the owner doesn’t get time to move ahigher court.”
 
 On Wednesday, repeated calls and messages by 
  to Satrajit Roy, the owner of Megacity Inn, yielded no result. In March, Roy had said: “They can’t demolish our building. We have obtained a status quo from the land reforms tribunal after submitting certificate of clearance, building plan and other documents. The matter will be heard on June 6. We shall wait for the outcome.”
 
 The office of North 24 Parganas district magistrate Antara Acharya confirmed the tribunal’s order. “The tribunal passed its order in the government’s favour. Now there will be no stopping of the demolition of Megacity Inn,” a senior executive at the DM’s office said.
 
 The demolition drive on March 29 had included a school building that was kept out of the notification as RVNL had already taken over it last year. “In three weeks, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation pulled down five structures, but couldn’t touch Megacity Inn despite the demolition notice,” said Prasad.
