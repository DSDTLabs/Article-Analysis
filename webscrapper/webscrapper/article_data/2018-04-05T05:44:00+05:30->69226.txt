Nagpur: Till now, hawkers used to return to the streets after the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s anti-encroachment squad left the spot. But on Wednesday, a hotel operating illegally from the basement of Wockhardt Hospital on North Ambazari road opened soon after the squad of Dharampeth zone left.

 The multi-storey hospital violated the sanctioned plan and carried out illegal construction in its basement meant for parking. As a result, visitors are forced to park vehicles on the road, thus causing frequent traffic snarls. 
 
 After TOI raised the issue, the zone office ignored its own notices served to Bouffage. Armed with an excavator and a truck, the anti-encroachment squad of the Dharampeth zone led by assistant municipal commissioner Mahesh Moroney reached the spot on Wednesday. 
 
 “Spotting the squad, the hotel owner assured to vacate the place and sought 24 hours’ time,” said Moroney. “So, we have given him time to vacate the space meant for parking,” he said.
 
 But soon after the squad left, the hotel started operating like any other normal day.
 
 When this was brought to Moroney’s notice, he said, “The eatery owner has sought 24 hours’ time for removing the illegal structure. If he fails to do so, further action shall be taken.”
 
 The zone has also imposed a fine of Rs20,000 against the food joint owner.
 
 According to Moroney, the zone has identified unauthorized constructions in 119 buildings. The zone has razed 92 structures. Of the 27 left, action has already been initiated against 16 violators, while eight have filed revised plans and around three cases were pending in court, he said.
