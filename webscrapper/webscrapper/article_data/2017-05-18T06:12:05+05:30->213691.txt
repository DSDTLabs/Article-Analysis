AMRITSAR: World Sikh Organization (WSO) of Canada has held the Vancouver Mainland Football League (VMFL) responsible for failing to properly probe racist humiliation a 15-year-old Sikh   Arjun Singh Sran had to face.   of WSO, in a release sent to TOI on Wednesday, informed that Arjun, who represents the Cloverdale Leopards football team, was subjected to racist taunts during a match on October 23, 2016 against the Coquitlam Chargers. 

 During the course of the match, Arjun was repeatedly held back by the oppostion and his complaints to the referee were overlooked. He informed “During the last play of the game, Arjun was again held back and was told “look at the scoreboard you f*cking terrorist.”
 
 Another player told Arjun “go back to your country,” he said. He added instead of taking action against the erring players, a referee told Arjun, “If they say something like that, you should be the better man and not say anything.” Following the game, Arjun lodged a complaint with the British Columbia Community Football Association of which the VMFL was a member, he said .
 
 The WSO had written to both VMFL and BCCA but to no avail. Senior policy adviser of WSO   said, “We are disappointed that such serious allegations of racism in the VMFL have not been taken seriously. It is shocking that a player could be meted out such treatment but told to be a better man. It is incumbent on the part of VMFL to hold those responsible for racist behaviour accountable and ensure that our youth have enjoy playing soccer.” He said WSO would be supporting Arjan to address the issue.
