THANE: The anti-extortion cell of Thane police has arrested a key member of an online cricket betting ring for providing customised software for a racket that was busted in  . This is the fifth arrest in the racket. The previous four arrested bookmakers, or bookies, allegedly had an online betting set-up with countrywide reach. The system was highly successful during the recently concluded   season, the police said.

 The latest bookie to be arrested,   (27), was reportedly instrumental in customising online betting for the IPL and allegedly made it easier for both punters and bookies to conduct betting on cricket matches, said a police officer. “Joshi, a Mulund resident, was key to setting up the entire ring, operational in various cities simultaneously,” an officer said.
 
  
  
 He said the server of the website   and the other racketeers used seems to be in Russia and a technical probe is underway. An officer said a Pakistan link too has been found and the police are working on it.
 
 On May 16, the date of the Mumbai Indians vs Kings XI match at   stadium, detectives from the police’s anti-extortion cell got a tip-off about the betting operation at Dombivli. They raided a shop at Shanti Sadan, Dombivli (east), and arrested three bookies, Gautam Savla (43), Nikhil Sampat (53) and Nitin Punjani (28). Later, Khushal Khimji (41), aka  , was arrested.
 
 The raiding party seized two laptops, Rs 1.6 lakh in cash, three cellphones and a diary containing the contacts of punters, said investigating officer RV Kothmire.
 
 The shop from where the betting operation was carried out was rented especially for the IPL season. Bookies usually prefer to operate from secret locations and refrain from accepting bets from people not known to them. The activities within the shop were thus camouflaged.
