PORVORIM: To improve digital literacy among school children and to ensure that computer   remains relevant in a fast-changing technology-driven world, Goa’s ministry of information and technology plans to revise the computer syllabus taught in educational institutions.

 Speaking to TOI, minister for information and technology   said that the government would also start citizen service centres across Goa to assist senior citizens, within a month or two.
 
 “All schools in Goa should have computer labs. The IT department will set the syllabus and we will appoint the teachers for the computer classes. There will be nodal officers from the department,”   said.
 
 The minister said that students will have become IT savvy in the latest hardware and software technologies by the time they complete their entire schooling.
 
  “We can’t offer the same stagnant content,” he said.
 
 Given the state and central government’s push for cashless payment and e-services, it was vital for the common man, especially senior citizens, to be able to use online services and thus minimise their interaction with the government.
 
 “Training will be imparted for self help groups and senior citizens in using smartphones, Skype, MS Office and MS Excel. Even government officers will have to undergo training every two years because governance or service delivery will be through online platforms,” he said.
