NASHIK: One of the few highly qualified candidates,   of   wants to make a difference in the city’s political scenario.

 Holding a post-graduate diploma in hospital management,   in marketing, MBA in finance, and MBA in international business management, Ahir entered politics after realising the necessity to have educated politicians to bring change. Contesting from prabhag 12, Ahir has a flourishing import-export business.
 
 “Considering the way politics is going on in India, at least in Maharashtra and Nashik, we badly need educated people in politics. Instead of simply sitting and talking about what should be done, if we can actually do it, it would be useful,” he said.
 
 His priorities are to complete civic works that have been pending for years as it adds to the expenses of the civic body.
 
 “First, I want to focus on the incomplete works because basically the corporation has paid for it. If the projects are delayed, then the money goes waste. Also, while campaigning in the prabhag I have realised that there is significant water scarcity here. There are some pipeline issues. This is the condition in a place like Nashik, where there was no problem of water till now,” he said.
 
 Women’s safety, particularly with respect to chain snatching, is another priority for Ahir. He wants CCTVs installed across the city.
 
 “The purpose of public parks are not being served. They are in a pathetic condition. Well-equipped libraries are also needed for students. The population has increased but not the space. I want to work on these issues, besides getting speed-breakers installed as per the government’s guidelines,” Ahir said.
