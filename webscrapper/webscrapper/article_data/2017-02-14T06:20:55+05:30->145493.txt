LUCKNOW:   don’t bode well for the   planned around this time. With political parties booking tent material well in advance, people with weddings or other such ceremonies in their family are being turned away by tent house owners.

 Tent house owners said people who have ceremonies lined up any time between February 14 and 18 are being charged double. Around 1,000 weddings and other ceremonies are planned during this period. This time round, however, more than 200 orders for various ceremonies could not be accepted for want of   and other decorative items, said a major tent house owner. Items like sofas, VIP  , mist fans, tables, iron and wooden poles are hardly available these days.
 
 Wedding decoration planner Hamid Husain said he refused more than 45 customers due to shortage of items and workers. “The biggest problem is of labourers with many of them going on leave. Also, VIP chairs and sofas are booked for specific dates, like February 15, 16 and 17, which are considered as peak dates for weddings specially.”
 
 Arshad Raza in Old Lucknow deals only in wooden chairs and tables. “Only those families that had placed their orders a month in advance are getting the service on time. The rest are not even on the waiting list till February 18. Even my sub-dealers are on the waiting list,” he said. 
 
 “It was so difficult finding everything. I ended up changing the date of my son’s engagement which will be on February 18. Though my dealer still has had to arrange tables and iron poles for the stage from Barabanki,” said Aagha Raees.
