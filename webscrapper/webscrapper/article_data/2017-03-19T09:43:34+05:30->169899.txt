GUWAHATI: Chief of the Mising Autonomous Council, Ranoj Pegu, joined   here on Saturday. 

 Pegu's former party   is in power in the council. He said he took the decision to join BJP because of the party's philosophy. "The recent election has shown how BJP has become a political force in the country," he added.
 
 Sources said Pegu was expecting a BJP ticket for the Dhemaji assembly constituency bypolls that fell vacant after the incumbent legislator   won from the   parliamentary seat last year.
