MEERUT: After   starrer ‘Dangal’ emerged the highest grossing Hindi film ever, there are plans afoot in UP to rope in Phogat sisters Geeta and Babita, the wrestling stars on whom the film was loosely based, to “sensitise and energise voters, especially women, to come out in large numbers for the upcoming  .

 The film — a biographical sports drama inspired by the life of the Phogat family in which Aamir plays the role of the girls’ father Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former wrestler himself — feel many in the UP administration will have an instant connect in “wrestling belts” of the state.
 
 Geeta is India’s first female wrestler to win a gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. 
 
 Meerut district magistrate B Chandrakala told TOI, “Purpose of inviting the Phogat sisters is that they symbolise women empowerment, and we want them to inspire women to come out in larger numbers to vote.”
