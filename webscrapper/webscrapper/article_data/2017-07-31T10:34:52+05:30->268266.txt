Sharad Malhotra and his   co-actress   might have differences in their relationship on screen, but in real life the two seem to share a very casual relationship with each other.
 
  Recently, the two were sitting together and chit chatting when   suddenly spotted a cockroach on the floor and couldn't help but jump off the couch and got scared.
  
  Kratika, being the strong one of the two, picked up the cockroach and started scaring him with it, and we can't help laughing at the actor's reaction to the cockroach.
  
  
 
  
  The actress shared the video on Instagram and wrote, "Bhaiyon aur behno..ye dekhiye.. @sharadmalhotra009 vs a cockroach...ha ha ha."
  
  
  
  Earlier, there were reports about   and   Sengar being warned by the channel for their rude behaviour. According to the report, Kratika had been behaving rudely with the media. In fact, she scared them away stating that she couldn't concentrate on her scenes.
  
  The actress on multiple occasions had refused to give interviews to the media. Kratika's co-star is no less. As per the report, Ssharad had been losing temper at the drop of his hat. He had apparently been yelling at the production unit. Buzz was that the alleged reason behind Ssharad's foul mood was his ex-girlfriend Divyanka and her fiance Vivek Dahiya's shoot next-door. The report further claimed that the channel has had talks with both the 'Kasam' leads. They had been warned for their behaviour. Kratika had been told to clean up her act or face the consequences, concluded the report.
