NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court   life imprisonment   to a   of Sikkim Police, who gunned down   of his   after they tried to sodomise him, to 10 years jail term.

 A bench of Justices Sunil Gaur and A K Chawla said the act was unintentional and one where, in a fit of rage, the accused ‘exceeded his right to self defence.’
 
 “Appellant (constable) had, in a fit of anger, reacted violently by indiscriminately firing at his five colleagues, who had attempted to sodomise him,” the bench noted while hearing the constable’s appeal against his conviction.
 
 The constable initially took the defence that he was falsely implicated. However, later he said he was sodomised by the five colleagues.
 
 On March 11, 2007 local police received information that firing had taken place at Dena Bank near Golcha Cinema. When a police team reached the spot, they found the appellant injured and the bodies of five colleagues inside the bank’s treasury chest.
 
 “Since the incident took place on a grave and sudden provocation, and due to appellant losing his self-control, therefore, the instant case is covered by the second exception to IPC Section 300,” the court said.
 
 As the prosecution case stands proved, conviction of appellant is altered from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder and modified his sentence to 10 years jail term with a fine of Rs 50,000, the bench said.
