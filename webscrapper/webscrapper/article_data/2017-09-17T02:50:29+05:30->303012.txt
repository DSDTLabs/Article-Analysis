KOLKATA: A century-old building on BT Road, near Tallah water tank, collapsed in the wee hours of Saturday, killing a 16-year-old resident. Victim   became the sixth building-collapse casualty in two months.

 The roof came crashing down a little after midnight when Pooja’s brother and their father were sleeping outside because it was too hot inside the house. Her mother and Pooja’s other brother were staying at a relative’s house. 
 
 When the roof collapsed, Pooja’s father and brother could do nothing but watch helplessly since no one was around at that time of the night. However, the noise brought out the neighbours in a while and they carried out the victim’s body from underneath the rubble. Doctors at   declared Pooja brought dead. 
 
 According to a   buildings department official, the civic body had declared the structure as unsafe 16 years ago, but tenants refused to shift out. A month ago, civic engineers had rushed to the spot when parts of the roof collapsed. An elderly woman narrowly escaped being trapped under the debris. After this, a couple of tenants decided to move out. However, there were still eight others who chose to stay back.
 
 Pooja’s father Sailendra, an auto-rickshaw driver, blamed the incessant rain for weakening the already insecure structure. Gupta added that a section of tenants on Wednesday had chopped a tree which had been supporting the dilapidated roof. “My daughter died in front of my eyes and I could not do anything to save her,” he said.
 
 The buildings department on Saturday decided to demolish the entire structure. “We had warned the tenants of the building several times. Now we have decided to pull down the entire structure,” said an official.
