NEW DELHI: While there is no official word on the much-awaited legal tag for   awaiting   in the capital,   Arvind Kejriwal on Friday promised “timebound development” to residents. 

 Seeking specific deadlines for each colony, the CM set the year-end as the final deadline for completion of all development work in these areas. Officials have been told that the deadline is “sacrosanct”.
 
 The timing of the CM’s meeting on unauthorised colonies is significant, considering that bypolls loom large in 20 assembly constituencies. The MLAs of these constituencies, also appointed as parliamentary secretaries, have been disqualified by the Election Commission. The AAP MLAs have gone to the Delhi high court over the issue and the HC has directed EC to not notify the bypolls till hearing in the case is complete.
 
 Of the 1,639-odd unauthorised colonies that are under scrutiny for regularisation, development work will be carried out in 1,481. The remaining cannot be taken up as yet as they are either on land under the purview of the Archaeological Survey of India or the forest department. The CM’s multi-department meet comes at a time when the budget for 2018-19 is being finalised. Presented in March every year, Delhi’s budget this time is likely to see an emphasis on allocations for development in unauthorised colonies.
 
 Promising adequate budgetary support, Kejriwal reportedly said that the roads and drains need to be in good condition all over the capital, and not just in Lutyens’ zone and the planned colonies. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, urban development minister Satyendar Jain, labour and development minster Gopal Rai, the chief secretary and senior officials from PWD and urban development ministry, DJB CEO, DSIIDC and irrigation and flood department were present at the meet.
