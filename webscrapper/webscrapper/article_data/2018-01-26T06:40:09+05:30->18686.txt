LUCKNOW: You may have witnessed the proud moment of a   ceremony several times. But have you ever heard the colours of the   on radio during a ceremony? 

 In a unique initiative,   will broadcast the first ever flag hoisting of the   on radio on Friday at 10am. 
 
 Every colour has its own specific frequency because of which we can see them. Just like that, they also have an audio frequency, say the creative people behind the idea. 
 
 The radio station will play a musical piece using the frequencies of the colours of the tricolour. This will be the first ever flag hoisting of the tricolour on radio. 
 
 An audio flag hoisting will be organised at Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University at 9am and for the visually impaired children of   (SPARSH) at 10am.
