BENGALURU: Sandalwood actor   is under police scanner following a complaint pertaining to cheating lodged against her brother and another person at RMC Yard police station. 

 While Sindhu is said to be out of the country, her brother  , 40, and his aide  , 35, were arrested for cheating Bank of Baroda. In his complaint, bank manager   said Varma had approached the bank for a vehicle loan of Rs 36 lakh in October 2017. 
 
  He reportedly presented a fake invoice for the high-end car he intended to purchase and got the loan. Instead of buying the car, he used the money for personal reasons. The con came to light when Manoj failed to repay the instalments and started avoiding calls from the bank. 
 
  "Manoj, who runs a resturant in Malleswaram, took a loan saying he wanted to buy a car costing around Rs 45 lakh. Trusting him, we transferred the money to his account and now we find that he never purchased the vehicle. The invoice he produced to us proved to be a fake," bank officials told police. 
 
 While Manoj is a resident of Malleswaram, Nagashri Shivanna of   was charged with providing the fake invoice. Police said Sindhu had come under their scanner as she had moved Rs 10 lakh to Varma's bank account which was the basis for the bank approving his loan request. 
 
 "We're trying to contact Sindhu Menon. According to Manoj, she has gone abroad for official purposes and will return soon. Once she lands, we'll question her," a senior police officer said.
