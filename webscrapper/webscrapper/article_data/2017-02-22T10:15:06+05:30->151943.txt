Bollywood actor   was trolled by   on Tuesday. It all began when Varun couldn’t vote for the BMC elections 2017 as his name was missing from the voter list and came out to issue his statement to the media. He said, “It’s upsetting that I couldn’t find my name on the voter list. My name has not shown up in the list unfortunately, it’s bizarre because I voted last year. Will find out from EC where is my name.”

 The funny part was that there were no elections last year. Twitter, which is quite harsh and unforgiving in such matters, immediately jumped at the chance and trolled the actor. Many even compared him to his ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’ co-star   for his goof-up.
  
  
  However, Varun was quick to acknowledge his mistake. The actor reportedly said that it was a slip of tongue and he meant that he voted for the 2014   elections.
