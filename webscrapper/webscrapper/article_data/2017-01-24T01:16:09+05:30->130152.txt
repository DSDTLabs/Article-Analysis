BENGALURU: Following in the footsteps of the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, now the Karnataka government is putting pressure on the Centre to revoke its ban on the traditional kambala (buffalo race).

 Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Monday said the state government was in favour of kambala, and sought the Centre’s support just as it has supported jallikattu in Tamil Nadu.
 
 Both the ruling Congress and opposition BJP in Karnataka also joined the chorus to call off the ban. Petitions by several kambala organisers, asking for the high court stay to be vacated, will be heard on January 30. 
 
 To press for allowance of kambala, hundreds of people, along with about 250 pairs of buffaloes, will protest at the Swaraj Maidan, Moodbidri on January 28.
 
 At a meeting of several kambala organising committees on Sunday, the organisers decided to hold a kambala that day in Mangaluru. “We decided to conduct the event before the matter comes up for hearing,” Ashok Rai, president,  , said. 
 
 Widespread violence and mass protests across Tamil Nadu had forced the government to pass an ordinance allowing jallikattu (bull taming), a popular heritage sport. 
 
 Kambala, like jallikattu, was banned last year after animal rights group   approached the Karnataka HC, citing animal cruelty in bull taming and buffalo racing. In view of the apex court verdict on jallikattu, the high court had also stayed this event. With an eye on the 2018 assembly elections, Karnataka politicians have ushered in their support in favour of the sport.
 
 A similar situation was seen in Tamil Nadu recently, where the government stoked popular sentiment in favour of reviving jallikattu, by demanding measures to circumvent the judiciary. While Congress is looking for a foothold in the coastal belt, where it is weak, by extending support to kambala, the BJP is desperately ensuring its support base there remains intact.
