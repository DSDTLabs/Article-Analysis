BATHINDA:   (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal has accused AAP national convenor   of staying at the residence of a   member while campaigning in Punjab. 

 Addressing an   in Ferozpur on Sunday, Sukhbir said by staying at the residence of the KCF member, Kejriwal had given a signal that he was ready to go to any extent to capture power in the state. He said such patronisation of extreme elements by AAP would spoil the peaceful atmosphere in the state. “We have been able to achieve peace and communal harmony after a lot of difficultly. But it seems Kejriwal is bent upon destroying both for his political interests,” he added. 
 
 Sukhbir said earlier too Kejriwal had consorted with radical elements when he had held a breakfast meeting with a member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, which was a frontal organisation of the Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). He said the incidents of sacrilege in Punjab started after the entry of AAP here.
