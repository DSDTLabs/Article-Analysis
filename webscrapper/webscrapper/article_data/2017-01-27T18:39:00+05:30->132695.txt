In a still from his upcoming film ' ',   can be seen in a daring red dress, a tassel earring dangling from his right ear and some lipstick, the same shade as the dress, outlining his lips. Why has he cross-dressed?

  
  “It’s an extremely essential scene which takes the story forward. I haven’t cross-dressed for a bit of comedy,” shares Swwapnil. He says that right from cult films like 'Ashi Hi Banawa Banawi', where   and   dressed up in saris for a majority of the film’s length and comedians in comedy shows who do it for a part, cross-dressing isn’t frowned upon in Marathi film and television industry. “I have done it myself when I was a part of 'Comedy Circus'. But I’ll be donning a woman’s grab for the first time for a film, but I am comfortable with the idea.”
 
 Here are some more stills from the scene. 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 Ask him if he received any tips from his co-star   who wore a sari for his role in 'Balgandharva', “No I didn’t get any tips, because I’ve done this before, so I did not need any, but I am very happy with the chemistry we share on screen. Subodh and I have an understanding and that reflects in our portrayal of two close friends.”
