Chandigarh: The Union ministry of chemicals and fertilisers has written to registrar of Mohali-based Niper that its director should not have been allowed to join the institute. The letter (a copy of which is with TOI) stated that the director is still on the rolls of Kakatiya University (Telengana), from where he was to be relieved before taking over as  .

 Dr Raghuram Rao joined Niper as the director on May 8 and as per its statue his tenure is for five years. This was mentioned in the advertisement for his selection. However, his relieving order from the university mentioned that he has been permitted to accept the offer from Niper on foreign deputation for a period of two years.
 
 After the ministry intervened, Dr Rao wrote to his university for a fresh relieving order. But he still retained the post of professor in Kakatiya University. He wrote: “I am advised to get my relief revised from you. Hence, I request you to permit me to go on lien or any other eligible leave as deputation is not acceptable for the government of India rules. My superannuation at the university is on June 30, 2020. Kindly permit me to retain lien on my position at Kakatiya university still superannuation by issuing revised relieving order.”
 
 Sources said the boards of governors of Niper have decided to meet and take note of the issue. When Prof Rao was asked about the alleged breach of contract as he still retains both the posts, he said, “I have applied for retirement under voluntary retirement scheme from my previous employer which has been informed to our ministry,” said Dr Rao.
 
 Niper got a full term director after a span of seven years. “The ministry had asked for a fresh relieving order. However, the director has recently applied for VRS,” said Wg Cdr P J P Singh Waraich (retd), registrar, Niper.
 
 Sources said the VRS letter will take time and till then occupying the post of the director is not abiding by the rules of Niper.
