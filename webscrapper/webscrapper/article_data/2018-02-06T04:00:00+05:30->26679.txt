Chennai: TVS Motor Company, on Monday launched India’s first Bluetooth-enabled scooter — which it hopes will sell 2 lakh units over the next 12 months. If this happens, it will increase the lead that TVS Motor has over Hero MotoCorp in the scooter segment. Japanese two wheeler giant Honda leads the scooter market in India.

 TVS sells nearly 80,000 scooters a month while Hero MotoCorp sells nearly 67,000 a month. Between April and December, TVS Motor sold 8.25 lakh scooters while Hero sold 6.58 lakh scooters. Market leader Honda sold more than 29 lakh scooters.
 
 “With this new launch — NTorq 125, we will sell another two lakh units over the next 12 months,” said KN Radhakrishnan, CEO of TVS Motor.
 
 The new scooter — Bluetooth-enabled — is priced at Rs 58,750 ex-showroom in Delhi. “With the rapid scooterisation of Indian market where one in every three two wheeler sold is a scooter, the NTorq will appeal to the Gen Z buyers,” he added.
 
 NTorq 125 premieres the TVS SmartXonnect, a Bluetooth-enabled technology which is paired to an exclusive NTorq mobile App which can be downloaded from google play store. TVS SmartXonnect enables a host of features in addition to the fully digital speedometer. It includes navigation assist, top speed recorder, in-built lap-timer, phone-battery strength display, last parked location assist, service reminder, trip meter among other features.
 
 “We want to add one to two percentage points to our market share every year. Our scooter share 34% and our internal plan is to grow faster than competition,” Radhakrishnan said.
