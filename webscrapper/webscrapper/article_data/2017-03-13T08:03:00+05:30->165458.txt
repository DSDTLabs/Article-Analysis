AHMEDABAD: While Gujarat may rank sixth in arresting accused under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act-2012, the majority of suspected child predators are yet to be punished by law. According figures of   ( ), 117 persons were arrested under   in 2014 and 1,635 in 2015 in the state. However, none have been convicted from those arreseted in 2014, and only three were convicted from those arrested in 2015 till the government published the data.

  States that recorded more arrests and convictions than Gujarat under Pocso cases in 2015 include Uttar Pradesh (5,275),   (1,869), Tamil Nadu (1,841), West Bengal (1,701) and Karnataka (1,644).
 
 There is a noticeable gap between arrests of suspects and convictions of child predators in the state.
 
 According to MHA figures which were recently tabled in the  , the conviction rate in terms of arrested persons in Gujarat was just 0.18%. It needs mention that the state has the lowest conviction rate among the top 10 states in Pocso cases.
 
 Gujarat made 8.75% of the country’s total 18,651 arrests under Pocso cases in 2015. In the same year, 1,072 persons were convicted in the country, which shows that Gujarat made just 0.27% conviction in the Pocso cases in 2015.
 
 A senior police official said that the figures of the Pocso cases should be seen in perspective. “While the cases might have seen a rise, the sudden spike is due to application of Pocso in cases where minor girls elope and report sexual relationship.”
 
 “There have been a number of workshops to educate police personnel where sections of Pocso can be applied and the framework required for registration of cases and questioning of the victims,” he said.
 
 Pocso Act has been enacted to protect children aged below 18 years from sexual offences. The Act has provisions of punishment from seven years to life imprisonment.
