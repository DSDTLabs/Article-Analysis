GURUGRAM: The   of Begumpur Khatola village, on the outskirts of the city, played peacemaker between Gujjars and Rajputs on Thursday, and imposed fines on seven youths for creating a ruckus. 

 Residents of nearby 30 villages and the police were present at the panchayat headed by Chaudhary Shayam Singh, who identified the seven youths and imposed a fine of Rs 5,100 on each of them.
 
 The panchayat was held in response to tension that arose after a video and post — which have since disappeared — mocking Rajputs, rumoured to have been uploaded on   from somewhere in Uttar Pradesh, went viral. Soon, it began getting circulated on WhatsApp, and reached Gurgaon’s outskirts, police said. 
 
 “A small tiff was blown out of proportion but we have now got both parties to understand the situation and reconcile. They have come to a compromise,” said inspector Rajender Kumar, SHO, Badshapur police station.
 
 A Gujjar youth, Shiv Kumar alias Bhola, in Begumpur Khatola village ‘liked’ the video on Facebook on Tuesday. He later complained to police that sometime later, a group of around 20 Rajput youths — most from the village, with a few from neighbouring Khandsa, carrying guns and sticks, arrived at his house and began thrashing him. They also allegedly thrashed his mother, and made a video of their thrashing. By the time police reached the spot after being informed, the accused had escaped from the village. Overnight, the video, accompanied by a commentary track that mocked Gujjars, went viral.
 
 Two subsequent police cases were filed and a panchayat was called on the issue on Wednesday, during which, a group of rival Gujjar youths arrived to create a ruckus.
