GURUGRAM: The forest department has filed a police complaint against a farmhouse  , alleging he has encroached upon over two acres of land in the Ankheer area near Surajkund in Faridabad.

 “The   filed a police complaint after it inspected the area and found that about two acres have been encroached upon. We request police to take prompt action, as the land is under sections 4 and 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900,” said a source in the Faridabad district forest office (DFO). 
 
 The department sprang into action after Faridabad-based environmental activist Jitender Bhadana filed a complaint. “I filed a complaint at DFO about illegal  , tree felling and mining activities carried out in the Faridabad Aravalis,” alleged Bhadana. He alleged that trees, mostly  , have been felled in the area. “Over 50 kikars were cut to encroach upon the land. Tree felling has become rampant, especially after Haryana government recently permitted cutting of kikar. It’s dangerous for the area’s ecology,” he added.
 
 Environmentalist Vivek Kamboj agreed, saying, “Granting permission to fell trees for one real estate project gives an opportunity to others to cut trees and encroach upon land. The irony is, the authorities themselves spent several crores to plant the kikar trees during the 1990s and 2000s.” The forest department said they couldn’t establish if trees were felled at the site. “There is evidence of land encroachment, but we can’t say anything about tree felling,” said a forest official.
