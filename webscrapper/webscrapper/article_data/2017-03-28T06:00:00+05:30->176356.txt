As Meduri Padmavathi’s fingers plucked the veena’s strings gently with her fingertips, the soulful nada of veena rung through the air at the weekend musical concert  . 
Padmavathi was ably accompanied by   on mridangam and   on ghatam. Padmavathi’s steady pace brought out the soul and bhava of each of the compositions. 
 Unfortunately, small concerts like this attract a very small audience. Nevertheless the handful of people who were present at   relished the recital till the end as she doled out Thyagaraja keerthanas, Padmanabhaswamy keerthanas, Annamacharya keerthanas and a few raga-based bhajans.
