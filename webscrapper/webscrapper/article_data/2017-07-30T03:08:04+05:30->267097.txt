MUMBAI: Results of most major exams conducted by   are unlikely to be declared by the July 31 deadline. The university, which is running against time to meet the deadline set by Governor  , may not be able to declare more than 125 of the 350 pending results by Monday, say officials. It may not even include some papers from science, technology and arts. Even as 13.92 lakh of the 17.28 lakh answer sheets were assessed by Saturday, the production of results is consuming time at this stage, said officials. The university also called an urgent meeting of the academic and management councils and the   on Sunday to pass the perspective plan for the coming academic session.

 A university official said it is impossible to predict the number of results likely to be out by Monday. “A lot of processes are involved in production stage too. Results are tallied with attendance of students in the exam. Internal marks also have to be added,” said the official. The university, which was to release TYBSc results by Saturday, couldn’t do so.
 
 Registrar M A Khan however said if everything is in place it is not difficult to announce 50-100 results at a time. “We request teachers to continue the work even on Sunday and hope to come out with at least 125 results by Monday,” said Khan.
 
 Meanwhile five days after assessment of MU papers started at  , merely 2,000 papers have been assessed. Faculty is facing technical issues: diagrams are not clear, papers don’t get loaded and two or more staffers are getting the same answer script, claim assessors. “Only about 50/60 teachers are turning up to assess papers,” said  , principal of Dhanvate National College, Nagpur, the only centralized assessment process centre set up. Teachers claim many papers were not scanned as on July 28, three months after the exams.
