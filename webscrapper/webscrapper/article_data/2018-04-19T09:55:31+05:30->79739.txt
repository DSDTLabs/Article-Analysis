BENGALURU: A tender recently finalised by   on the animal birth-control programme for   has opened a can of worms. While animal activists allege the move will cause the canines to suffer under untrained veterinarians, residents affected by the stray menace want the Palike — which claims to be going by the rulebook — to implement the programme.

 In a recent complaint lodged with the   and the BBMP commissioner,   resident L Srinivasan claimed there are some lacunae in the tender process, which allegedly violates a   order. He said executing the “problematic” tender may lead to butchering of stray dogs. “A condition in the tender floated by BBMP joint director (animal husbandry) for two zones mandates that each participant achieve sterilisation of at least 300 dogs per month per package. But BBMP doesn’t even know the number of strays in Bengaluru as their census is pending,” he claimed.
 
 Also, as per the tender conditions, if the agency fails to meet the target of 300, a penalty of Rs 100 per dog will be levied. “There is no logic behind setting such a target. The penal clause of Rs 100 is illegal. Such aggressive clauses will only force contractors to act like butchers,” he added. Srinivasan said the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules 2001 clearly state that only AWBI-recognised bodies and NGOs are authorised to perform birth-control surgeries on strays. “Despite this, BBMP has invited registered private veterinary practitioners, tenderers, companies and societies to bid.”
 
 Sakshar K, a dog lover, said NGOs are employed for the ABC programme as they have compassion for dogs, and they aren’t looking to make profits. “BBMP’s move belies this logic,” he added.
