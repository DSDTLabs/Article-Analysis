Popular model  , who recently made his Bollywood debut with the critically acclaimed  , will also be making an entry in Kollywood with Indrajith. The film starring   in the lead will have Rajveer playing a negative role. Talking about the opportunity, Rajveer says, “I had met Thanu sir four years ago. I was casually talking about looking for acting opportunities in the south. 

 He said if anything interesting comes by, he will let me know. Later, he called me when this film was happening. I had a chat with the director Kalaprabhu over phone and came down to Chennai for an audition. The role that I play is a person who speaks Hindi. So, it was relatively easy for me. Eventually, I was selected for the role.” The film also stars  . Elaborating about his role, Rajveer says, “It is not an out-and-out negative role... he has a grey shade, but there is a reason behind it. We shot in a dense forest in Kerala and some portions in Goa and Chennai.” But Rajveer says that he had fun shooting with the team.
 
  “It is my first Tamil film, so I was pretty excited and nervous. The team was supportive, and Gautham, too, was very helpful. He was down-to-earth and fun to work with. Actors like Sudhanshu made me feel at home. I learnt a lot of things, but I wish I had more dialogues in Tamil,” says Rajveer, who has a couple of south offers in his kitty.
