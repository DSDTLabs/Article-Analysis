DHARAMSHALA: When   was handed over his maiden Test cap in the morning, Australia would have been scratching their chins, wondering what they missed while reading the pitch. By the end of the first day of the fourth Test at the   here, they had their answer. The debutant chinaman had outfoxed the Aussies, proving  's prediction right.

 Kaif, Kuldeep's former captain at Uttar Pradesh, had tweeted at 8:46 am on Saturday: “Prediction ­ Kuldeep Yadav will have a great debut. Aussies should struggle to read him. Best wishes to Team India.”
 
 As things panned out, Kuldeep's figures of 4/68 turned the tables on the Aussies, who were bowled out for 300 after being 131/1 at one stage.
 
 Kaif, though, was not surprised.
 
 “You are never ready for a bowler like Kuldeep. You need to have a proper plan. I think Australia never expected him to play,” Kaif told TOI.
 
 “If a player has match-winning ability and skill to take wickets, then you must pick him. It's a masterstroke by   and Virat Kohli. Indian attack needed that, especially it being the Test that decides the outcome of the series. Great pick, that's why I tweeted in the morning that he will be the man of the moment,” he added.
 
 The hero of India's Natwest Trophy triumph in 2004 said Yadav is tougher than other chinamen, which makes him unique and gives India an edge in the field.
 
 “Give the ball to Kuldeep and wait and watch what happens. The difference between him and other similar spinners is that he is very accurate and will hardly give you loose balls. A batsman may come out and hit him over the top, like   did today , but he will be right back at you attacking the very next ball," Kaif said.
