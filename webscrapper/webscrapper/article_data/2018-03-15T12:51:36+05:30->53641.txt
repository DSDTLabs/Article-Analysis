TRICHY: Seeking reinstatement of five of their fellow workers in the Ordnance Factory   ( ), close to 100 temporary workers began their indefinite hunger strike on Wednesday.

 OFT has engaged about 100 temporary workers on contract basis to work in the canteen and for conservancy work. On Monday, the management suspended the contract of five of the workers. The temporary workers association took up the matter to the management and urged for their reinstatement. As the management refused to accept their demands, the workers decided to go on strike from Wednesday.
 
 The general secretary of the workers association   said that, they have also demanded to fix lunch time for the workers. Besides, they are also not allowed to go out in case of any personal emergency. The management has to accept these basic demands apart from reinstating the five workers for whom it is the matter of their livelihood, he said. 
 
 A team of officials from OFT carried out talks with the agitating workers, but they failed as both sides could not reach a consensus. Thus the workers decided to go ahead with the protest.
