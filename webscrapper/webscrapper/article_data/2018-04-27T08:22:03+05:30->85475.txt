VIJAYAWADA: The town planning wing of the   (VMC), taking cognisance of a multitude of complaints, is planning to take stringent action against unauthorised constructions across the city. 

  activity is mushrooming across the city after the announcement of the state capital and construction of 800 group houses and residential complexes is going on across Vijayawada and nagar panchayats surrounding the city. Considering a row of allegations on the issue of building plans, the state government has started implementing the online plan approval system to minimise interference of officials.
 
 Meanwhile,   constructions are thriving across the city and involvement of a few ground-level staff working in these departments is creating worries for the civic body. Officials of VMC who identified construction of a group of RCC sheds in the 58th division have demolished them with excavators and issued notice for violation of rules.
 
 Town planning wing of VMC which launched a   on illegal constructions across the city has issued notices to the illegal constructions and threatened to demolish the buildings if they failed to follow instructions. 
 
 City planner Lakshmana Rao said they have minimised the number of illegal constructions in the city with online mode of plan approvals. “Illegal constructions are strictly prohibited across the city and we are not releasing mortgage of property if builders violate rules and we are demolishing the buildings that violate guidelines,” he said.
 
 Double property tax will be charged as penalty to the buildings which violate the actual plan and majority of small and marginal houses which violated plans fall under this category, said city planner Lakshmana Rao.
 
 A few illegal constructions are still in progress in slums and hilly terrains and we are initiating stringent action as per the direction of commissioner J. Nivas.
