VARANASI: An assistant research officer, posted at   primary health centre (PHC) in Mirzapur, battered his wife to death with a hammer late on Tuesday night as he suspected that she was having an extra-marital relationship with some other man.

  committed the crime at his Varanasi residence and later surrendered before the   police.
 
 Police said Ramjanam lives in   locality under Cantonment police station jurisdiction along with his familyâ€”wife Janaki (45) and daughters Mansi, Mahima and son Harshdeep. The couple were having frequent quarrels as Ramjanam suspected Janaki was in an illicit relationship with a man.
 
 In fact, Ramjanam was so peeved with the state of affairs that he stopped going to work some 45 days ago. At around midnight on Tuesday, he hit Janaki on the head with a hammer killing her on the spot.
 
  reportedly told the police he suspected that in his absence Janaki used to call her lover at home and also visited him elsewhere.
