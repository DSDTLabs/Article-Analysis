HYDERABAD: Stating that both Telangana and   are facing a precarious situation over sharing of Krishna river water, the   (KRMB) on Friday allowed the two states to draw water from below the dead storage level of Srisailam and   dams in order to meet the drinking water requirement for the summer. The board met here at Jalasoudha with representatives of two states and allotted 24 TMC feet to Telangana and 9 TMC feet for AP for the month of March. But the board has directed the two states to ensure that the water level at Nagarjunsagar remains at 520 feet till March 20. This means the maximum releases will be made from Srisailam where about 20 TMC feet water is available above the dead storage level of 794 feet. 

 
  
 
 The board reiterated that it will stick to the 64:36 sharing ratio in the available waters in the two major dams for AP and Telangana respectively. At present, the water level at Srisailam dam stood at 841 feet while it was 523 feet at Nagarjunsagar. On the whole, the two dams have 33 TMC feet water for utilisation by the two states.
 
 The situation at  , on which farmers from the two states depend on to irrigate about two million acres of crop under the rabi season, is precarious as both the states are trying to divert water.
