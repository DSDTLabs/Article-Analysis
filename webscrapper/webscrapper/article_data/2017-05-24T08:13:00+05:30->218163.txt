BATHINDA: ‘Chamm’, a short film depicting Dalits’ struggle for their rights is going places after its screening across Punjab. The film is now set to be screened at the   film festival in France on May 25.

 On May 18, ‘Chamm’ was screened at the International Film Festival of South Asia at Toronto, Canada. The 35-minute film, directed by a Punjab-based filmmaker Rajeev Sharma (47), shows how the Dalit protagonist is disillusioned with the politicians. Out of a population of 2.77 crore, Dalits constitute 32%, according to the Census 2011. “We are glad that a short film on the plight of Dalits is being screened at international festivals. Through it we can show the real picture of Dalits in Punjab,” said Rajeev.
 
 “The film shows that though Dalits skin the hide of dead animals for their living, politicians peel their skin (mints money) for a lavish life and political gains,” said Sharma, who had won the national award for his earlier film ‘Nabar’ in 2013. 
 
 Sharma, who is pursuing doctorate in Latin American Cinema from   after completing his postgraduation in Indian theatre from Panjab University, Chandigarh, said, “We wanted to project the plight of Dalit men and women through the film. We feel satisfied with the response it has got.”
