Jaipur: Chief minister Vasundhara Raje on Saturday asked the government officials in the industry department to map the self-employment status till 2018.

 Reacting to the national president of Laghu Udyog Bharati Jitendra Gupta’s remark at the MSME conclave of the ongoing India International Fair that the ratio of self-employment has fallen in the country to 47% during 2006-2015 compared to 57% in 2005, Raje directed additional chief secretary, industries, Rajeev Swaroop to collect data in this regard.
 
 Acknowledging that MSMEs are the backbone of the economy, Raje highlighted the series of initiatives the government has taken in the last four years to give a fillip to the sector.
 
 She also asked the officials to address the challenges of the members of Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) face. In fact, LUB has flagged difficulties in research and development, imports, availability of finance and urged the government to promote cluster development and create new markets.
 
 Recognizing that there are similar schemes at the state and the Central level, CM asked the officials to work with the ministry of MSME to develop synergies in such schemes to expand the reach and increase their benefits.
 
 She also highlighted the measures taken by the industries department for extension of time for projects in terms of plot utilization.
 
 MSME secretary Arun Kumar Panda said that during last year, 52,000 units have been set up in the country because of various government policies creating 3 lakh jobs. “I expect another 5 lakh jobs to be created in the current year because of the livelihood generating schemes,” added Panda.
