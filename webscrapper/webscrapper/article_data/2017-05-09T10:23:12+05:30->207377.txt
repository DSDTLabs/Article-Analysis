CUTTACK: If   was a spectator here on Monday, he would have come out really pleased. For what unfolded in the match between   and Shillong Lajong was nothing short of a comedy of errors.

 There was a lucky deflected goal, an unlucky own goal, a swinging handball that was more like a legitimate volleyball shot, a miss at the goalline, a miss from the penalty spot, a co-ordinated first act and a frantic Act 2.
 
 It could have been dubbed a perfect comedy had it not been tragic for Lajong, who lost 2-3 to the superior Bengaluru outfit, in their opening Federation Cup tie at  . The main responsibility for this drama should be held by the sweltering heat that made movement difficult for the Shillong players in the first half, and took a toll on the energy and co-ordination of the BFC players in the second.
 
 It made the players clammer for water bottles at the touchline and also caused a pause in proceedings to let the players have some much-needed refreshment.
 
 While the impressive   (35') and   (47') were on target for Bengaluru, it was an own goal by Lajong skipper   (74') and a missed penalty by   that rendered the goals by   (72') and substitute Samuel Lalmuanpuia (85') meaningless. If the impact of heat was not enough, coaches also had to take into consideration the relentless schedule.
