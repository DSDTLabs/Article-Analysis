NAGPUR: Unruly scenes were witnessed at   when two groups of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) clashed on Sunday afternoon. Police have registered a case against   district president Nagorao Jaikar and others in this regard.

 A faction led by   was holding a meeting to demand ouster of state BSP president Vilas Garud. The members believed that Garud was taking the party downhill. The meeting had started at about 12 noon.
 
 At around 2pm, some activists led by Jaikar reached the venue along with a few cops and objected to the meeting. Ibrahim Tailor, Mohammed Jamal, Vijay Ghodeswar and Jitendra Mhaiskar were present. 
 
 Jaikar said that the organizers of the meeting had been expelled from BSP and hence they had no right to use party flags and banners. Raut pointed out that he had not been ousted but only two persons — Uttam Shewde and Sagar Dabrase — were present who were not BSP workers. Raut argued that he was only trying to save the party.
 
 Jaikar refused to buy these arguments and his followers proceeded to tear down the banners. This infuriated Raut’s followers who assaulted Jaikar. 
 
 The BSP leader ran out of the building and took refuge in his vehicle. Raut’s followers rained slippers on the vehicles. Police had to intervene to save Jaikar and his supporters.
 
 Later, Raut, Rekha Wasnik, Rehana Qureshi, Anita Somkunwar and   lodged a complaint at Sitabuldi police station. When the cops refused to register an offence, they staged a demonstration. The cops finally relented.
