PANAJI: The special investigation team (SIT) investigating the police-politician-drug mafia nexus is in a quandary. A House committee, chaired by former Nuvem MLA Francisco ‘Mickky’   has named a large number of police personnel as accused in the nexus.

 The SIT has now asked the state government for directives whether to file a general first information report (FIR) against police and politicians or register the FIR against the accused persons named in the House committee report.
 
 Superintendent of police (SP) Karthik Kashyap, in a notesheet to the government, has asked for a specific directive to the crime branch whether to conduct the enquiry or to investigate based on the report.
 
 A senior police official said, “Dozens of police personnel have been named as accused in the report. If we register the case against the police, then most police personnel will come under the scanner.”
 
 A senior officer at the state home department said, “We have forwarded the file to chief minister Manohar Parrikar for his instructions. Crime branch has already received the 2013 House committee report on police-politician-drug mafia nexus submitted by then Nuvem MLA Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco.”
 
 The state government had constituted an eight-member SIT headed by deputy superintendent of police (DySP)  .
 
 The state government had asked the anti-corruption branch (ACB) of the vigilance department to investigate the police-drug mafia nexus. But, the   did not conduct any investigation into the matter on grounds that it did not fall within its scope.
 
 The committee submitted its report to the state assembly in October 2013. The government transferred the report to the ACB for investigation in September 2015.
