CHENNAI: After traditional medicine and   failed, doctors at Chennai-based Agarwal's   used a novel technique to save vision in an 84-year-old   patient. On Saturday, Sulochana told reporters her once blurry close-up vision cleared minutes after the surgery. 

 The single-pass four throw pupilloplasty, the procedure developed by the hospital more than two years ago, was initially used to treat patients with trauma and other eye disorders that needed correction of the pupil. "It was successful in treating several patients and we even published it in peer-reviewed journals. But we never tried to use it in patients with glaucoma," said hospital head Dr Amar Agarwal. 
 
 Glaucoma, which occurs when a fluid called aqueous humor builds in the front part of the eye and increases its pressure, damages optic nerves leading to vision loss. An estimated 1.3 lakh people are blinded by the disease in the country every year. "The optic nerve taking images to the brain suffers slow irreversible damage," he said.
 
 In open angle glaucoma, one of the two main forms of the disease, the fluid accumulates slowly; in close angle glaucoma patients, the fluid passage between the iris (a thin, circular structure that gives eye its colour) and the cornea (the transparent layer in the front) narrows. 
 
 "This happens because the lens is pushed towards the iris," said Dr Agarwal. 
 
 While medicines can help reduce the fluid and or drain it, laser surgeries destroy cells producing the fluid or puncturing the iris. "In the new procedure, the iris is pulled to widen the passage. The needle makes just one pass into the iris yet keeps it in place. The outcomes are compared to laser treatment as we are correcting an abnormality without causing further damage. We have seen this happen in at least six patients now," he said.
 
 Sulochana's eye pressure, which at 40 mm Hg was almost double the normal value, dropped to near normal. "I have a bright and clear vision now...," she said
