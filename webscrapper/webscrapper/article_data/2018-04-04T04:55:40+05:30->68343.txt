NAVI MUMBAI: Once an abode for migratory birds, the Kalamboli holding   is being encroached rapidly as debris and garbage is being dumped on its embankment almost every day, killing mangroves. It seems that the pond’s death knell has been sounded as marble dealers too have started chucking pieces of broken stones.

 The pond, which is along the Sion Panvel highway and a stone’s throw from the upcoming Navi Mumbai international airport, opens out in the Taloja creek. Activist Rajesh Poojary said construction mafia is targeting the vast embankment adjoining Roadpali Road and encouraging slumdwellers to build garages, scrap shops and shanties there. Activist said encroachments will further destroy the flora and fauna and mangrove cover.
 
 “My plea to   has fallen on deaf ears,” said  , an activist.
 
  said all government agencies have turned a blind eye to the debris dumping and encroachment. “We demolished all illegal structures a couple of months ago and action was initiated against encroachers. We will take measures to stop such illegal activity,” said Bhagwan Patil, superintendent of   (PCMC). 
 
 Range forest officer Dnyaneshwar Sonawane said, “The land belongs to Cidco. We will take it up with Cidco and PCMC.” Sitaram Rokade, Cidco administrator (Kalamboli), said, “I will flag off the matter to the department concerned.”
