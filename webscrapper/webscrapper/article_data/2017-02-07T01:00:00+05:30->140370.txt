 Apart from Manish’s friends from the fashion industry, there were some Austrian guests at the party who said that they were in love with Indian fashion. Among those speaking highly of Indian fashion was Georg Zehetner, Charge d’Affaires at the Austrian Embassy. “Though I am very European in the way I dress, I really like traditional Indian designs for men, specially a bandhgala jacket and kurta. Among Indian fashion designers, I like Manish. He is such an optimistic and colourful person. I love the colours he uses in his designs,” said Zehetner.
