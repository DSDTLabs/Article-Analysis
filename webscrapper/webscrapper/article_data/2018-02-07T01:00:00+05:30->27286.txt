There’s nothing like a romantic track to connect lovers. Usually, every couple has a special song that they can relate to, something that is associated with a cherished memory. This is exactly what   had in mind when her team curated a special Valentine’s Day SongStruck edition playlist and started a special offer for the coming Valentine’s Day. For the uninitiated, SongStruck is a 20-minute live personalised musical performance at one’s doorstep. 

 Radhika, CEO, Happydemic, says, “I believe that having a couple’s song can reignite the spark in a relationship. Listen to the track and all the amazing times spent with your 
 better half will flash through your mind. For Valentine’s Day, we have curated a special edition. In addition to SongStruck-ing your loved one, we’ll also help you define your couple song and send a personalised message around it.”
