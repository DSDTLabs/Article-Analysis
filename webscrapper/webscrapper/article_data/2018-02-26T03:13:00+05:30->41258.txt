Panaji: Villagers of Merces expressed their opposition to the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority proposal, but panchayat authorities assured them that no part of the village had been included in the planning area. The issue of inclusion of the proposed Bambolim planning area to be taken under GPPDA was discussed, but panch Prakash Naik who answered queries in the presence of sarpanch Sunita Palienkar said no part of Merces was included. It was agreed that Naik would accompany villagers to GSIDC or the PWD to find out drainage plans for the proposed court building at Merces. The low-lying area is a balancing reservoir during the monsoon. A lake is also located nearby and the court building may cause water displacement if drainage was not taken care of. tnn
