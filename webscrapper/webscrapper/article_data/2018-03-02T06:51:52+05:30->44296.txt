MUMBAI: A special court on Thursday remanded Punjab National Bank chief manager   to   custody until March 13. Arrested on Wednesday Sharma, 54, is the 12th accused to be taken into custody in the alleged   scam, which had reached over Rs12000 crore, CBI told the court quoting PNB’s recent submission to the stock exchange. 

 According to the CBI, Sharma was the chief internal auditor between November 26, 2015 and July 15, 2017 at the   branch of PNB. Special CBI prosecutor A   told the court that during Sharma’s tenure at the branch, more than 150 LoUs worth of Rs 6498 crore were issued by (arrested accused) Gokulnath  , retired deputy manager of PNB, without following proper procedure and without having any sanctioned limit. 
 
 The CBI said Sharma, in his capacity as the internal auditor, was supposed to verify the daily transactions, report the irregularities and ensure that the same are rectified to protect the interest of the bank. “Sharma in conspiracy with other coaccused deliberately ignored to point out the issuance of illegal LoUs and allowed Shetty to open LoUs to favour the beneficiary private parties (Modi owned) Stellar Diamond, Solar Exports, Diamonds R US, which resulted in huge loss to PNB to the tune of Rs 6498 crore,” the CBI submitted. 
 
 The CBI said Sharma’s custody was required as he was not cooperating with the investigations and they wanted to unearth the larger conspiracy, ascertain the identity and roles of other accused and investigate the end use of huge amounts of public funds diverted by Modi and others who are on the run. 
 
 The defence advocate argued that the user identification and password of the SWIFT system was with arrested co-accused Shetty and a single-window bank operator (clerk), Manoj Kharat and Sharma had no role in the crime as had no access to the system.
