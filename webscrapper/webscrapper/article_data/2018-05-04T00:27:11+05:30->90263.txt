Madurai: The city corporation inaugurated its ninth shelter home for homeless people at Malligai Nagar in Anaiyur on Thursday. According to health officials, five more are to come up in the city, including one in Government Rajaji Hospital premises.

 The new facility constructed at a cost of Rs 30 lakhs was inaugurated by corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar. It can accommodate 25 men and women. Addressing the gathering at the inaugural program, the commissioner said that the corporation has been taking various measures for the upliftment of the urban poor. Schemes like shelter homes and ensuring the livelihood of roadside vendors under the National Urban Livelihood Mission are implemented effectively, he said. Mostly old people, deserted by their family members take refuge in the shelter homes run by the corporation. Aneesh Sekhar said that everyone in this world deserves a dignified life, which is a fundamental right and they have been striving to ensure it. However the commissioner said that it was high time people took care of the elderly, so that we donâ€™t need these facilities. He wanted the people entrusted with running the shelter to turn the facility into a home for the inmates. They should be engaged in activities they are interested in like planting trees and terrace garden. City health officer Sathish Raghavan said that as many as six homes have been opened in the last few months. The one coming up in GRH is meant for the relatives of the patients. With 25 beds in the newly opened facility, the total strength has gone up to 310. Once the GRH facility is inaugurated it would go up to 360, he said.
