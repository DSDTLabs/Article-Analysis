PANAJI: Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) has directed the Bardez deputy collector to inspect the site of an alleged reclamation of mangroves at Bastora as part of the highway widening work, even as residents are wary about imminent flooding problems.

 The contractor engaged by public works department (PWD) has carried out mud filling in   river for about 25 metres on either side of the highway and cleared mangroves. “This is an eco-sensitive area and some mangroves are being chopped for expantion of the highway,” Bastora resident Kapil   of   has complained to GCZMA. Taking cognizance of the alleged violation of the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) rules, 2011, the deputy collector has deputed a mamlatdar to look into the allegations, a source said.
 
 Clusters of houses are located in low lying areas on the periphery of the highway, which is being widened by extending the earthern embankments. “These houses along Moira road, Xell in Bastora and near Mapusa church are vulnerable to flooding during extreme monsoon events,” Korgaonkar said. A PWD official said that mud filling had been done to carry out pile foundations for the bridge on either side in the river, but the mud would be removed once the work is completed.
 
 Some questioned the dumping in the river instead of using technology. “There was no need to clear mangroves. If the mud is removed, it would mean more damage to mangroves to take trucks to the site,” said Michael D’Souza, a biodiversity management committee member.
 
 Environmentalists are irked by the insensitivity of authorities. In the past, water resources department (WRD) had reclaimed stretches of the river to lay a pipeline parallel to the highway. “The flood plains are destroyed in most places due to lack of awareness. By definition, a flood plain is an area that is likely to be inundated when there is a flood. But if it’s reclaimed, how will it absorb the excess water?” environmentalist Claude Alvares said.
