ROHTAK: While Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was a delivering speech on implications of electricity theft to residents of Mokhra village in Rohtak district on Saturday, the tent erected for his programme was allegedly using power illegally from a transformer. 

 Mokhra residents said it was a cruel joke on them as they were accused of power theft despite having paid their bills regularly. They alleged they were being punished while the chief minister's own officials were engaged in illegal activities under his nose. 
 
 Keeping the hot conditions in mind, the organizers had arranged an air-conditioner and coolers for the stage on which chief minister was to sit. 
 
 On being contacted,   superintendent engineer S K Bansal said the department had arranged generators for the CM's function. "All the electrical equipments were running on generators," he added. Regarding the power theft, Bansal said it was found that the owner of the tent house had made a temporary arrangement from a nearby electricity pole illegally. A theft case has been registered against the owner of tent house, he added.
 
 When officials were told about the stolen power for the event, they denied knowledge of of any such incident. After visuals of a wire hanging from an electricity pole near the tent of the chief minister surfaced, the officials shifted the blame to the tent house owner.
 
 Last month, a "kundi" (illegal) power connection has been detected at the residence of a SAD's women wing president of Muktsar district, a member of the Punjab State Commission for Women. A team led by Executive Engineer (Enforcement wing), PSPCL, Bathinda, conducted a raid at the local   and detected the power theft.
 
 Accelerating the campaign to curb electricity thefts in Haryana, the power utilities have detected 26,899 such cases involving an amount of 51.65 crore in the state in January and February.
 
 Of the total, Rs 16.75 crore has been recovered from defaulters, officials said.
