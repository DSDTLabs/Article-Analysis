NASHIK: The city police have registered 21 cases of cheating in January which included conmen posed as cops and those who pretended to be bank officials and took details of people's accounts or debit or credit cards, besides forgeries for illegal sale of properties and fake investment schemes. 

 Senior officials said they regularly appealed to people to beware of schemes that offer heavy returns in little time. One should not invest until he or she had taken complete information on the financial company.
 
 Vijaykumar Magar, deputy commissioner of police (crime) said, "Whenever we come across schemes which are suspicious, we take action so that people do not get duped."
 
  
  
 "A few days ago, a newspaper advertisement invited applications for 30,000 vacancies with an applications fee of Rs 379. The person who floated the advertisement could have gained crores even if he had got three application per post. We nabbed the culprit and launched a probe, though no offence has been registered so far."
 
 About a month back, police came across a website, www.borntogivehelp.com, which sought investments and offered to double the money in 10 days. A technical analysis has revealed that the website was being operated from Singapore. Police immediately issued a press note to appeal to people not to invest in the scheme.
 
 Police said cyber crime station was spreading awareness through social media to prevent people from investing money in such companies.
 
 Way back in 2012 there was the case of  , in which people from Deolali Camp, Bhagur and neighbouring areas lost over Rs 12 crore.
 
 In the KBC multi-trade financial scheme, not only people from   but those from other parts of the state were also duped.
 
 Magar said cases which are spread over the district and the state cannot be investigated by officials of a police station alone. Hence such cases are transferred to the economic offences wing.
