Vadodara: Mohammed Patel, who was found dead in his home on Tandalja Road, may have been murdered by someone known to him. The J P Road police said they are working on the theory of involvement of some insider. The cops, though, don’t have much clue about the case.

 “We have talked with the deceased’s family but they don’t have any idea. We are working on various angles but there is no clue about the murderer,” said V R Kher, PSI, J P Road police station. Thirty-eight-year-old Patel, who was an auto driver, was found murdered in his house at Medina Park in Tandalja area on Wednesday evening.
 
 According to the cops, Patel’s throat was slit with some sharp weapon. The police said that Patel’s family was away in Bharuch on Wednesday. 
 
 Patel had gone out in his auto in the morning and returned by noon. His wife called him over phone later but he didn’t respond to her call. She then asked her relative to go and check if Patel was at home. The police said that they are yet to ascertain the reason behind the murder.
