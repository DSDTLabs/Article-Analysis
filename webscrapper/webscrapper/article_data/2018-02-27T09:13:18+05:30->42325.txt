PHUNTSHOLING (BHUTAN): It has been a see-saw battle between   (co-driver  ) and   (co-driver  ) in   6 rally whose fourth and penultimate leg culminated here on Monday.

 
 Subir pulled back hard in the second leg of the time, speed, distance (TSD) rally to cut Ajgar's lead to just one point at the end of the second leg when the rallyists travelled around the Chitwan National Park in Nepal.
 
 Defending champion Ajgar, who led by eight points after Day I, picked up 31 penalty points on Day II which brought his score to 85. Subir on the other hand, collected only 24 penalty points to finish the second leg with 86 points.
 
 Ajgar, however, brought all his experience into play on the third morning when the cars were flagged off on in foggy conditions outside the Chitwan National Park. On another day of truncated rallying, when one stage was cancelled due to technical issues, the competitors drove along the Lothar river embankment and then down the   that links Nepal with India before entering the Itahari forest for the last competitive stage of the day. The drivers had to negotiate dirt tracks in the forests and a dry riverbed before getting back on the highway to return to enter India through the Kakarbhitta border.
 
 The third day's drive involved 610 km, although a large part of that fell outside the competitive section.
 
 By the time the rallyists finally retired after a long and hard day at Murti, beside the Gorumara National Park, Ajgar had managed to increase his lead to five points by collecting 14 penalty points as against Subir's 18.
 
 Captain   and navigator Chandan Sen all but ensured themselves of the third spot with 241 penalty points, opening up a handsome lead over their nearest competitors Nikunj Toshniwal-Prasenjit Roy (367), Anand Mehta-Sabatullah Khan (375).
 
 The fourth day's action unfolded mostly in the tea gardens of Dooars as the cars traversed through the region to finish at Phuntsholing.
