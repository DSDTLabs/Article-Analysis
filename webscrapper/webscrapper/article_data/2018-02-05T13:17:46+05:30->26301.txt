In a career of almost six years, 'I, Tonya' has marked the first time that actress   has played the lead. She said she was always hesitant about it. The biographical sports drama 'I, Tonya' features Robbie as real-life figure skater   and her connection to the 1994 attack on her rival  .

  
  
 When Robbie landed the role, it was the first time she could call home and said, "Mum, I'm the main part."
 
 "It's a big step, playing a lead, a step I've been hesitant to make. All the weight of the film rests on your shoulders. And if it doesn't work? It's that much harder for you to get a lead role again - especially if you're a woman," Robbie told media. "I feel like guys get a few more chances to be the lead in a flop. If you're a woman, and it flops? Good luck getting another one," she added.
 
 At the 90th Academy Awards next month, Robbie is a contender in the Best Actress category.
