Indore: While residents of Biyabani, who lost their houses during   done for road widening are yet to get legal papers of their houses, civic body is again planning to carry out another demolition drive at four kilometres stretch between Gangwal to Sarvate bus stand.

 Over 209 houses and shops owners in the area have been issued notice by the civic body. The owners have been asked to raise any concern or clarification within three days of the notice to authority concerned and present documents to support their claims.

The notice states that if no objection will be raised by the owners, then the civic body will start its demolition drive.

 The area is also densely populated so the civic body might have to face a lot of agitation. 
 
 While the civic body did not reveal when they were planning to carry out demolition, sources said that the work may begin within a month.
