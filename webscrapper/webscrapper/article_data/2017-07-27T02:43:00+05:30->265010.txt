Mumbai: The IAS association led by chief secretary Sumit Mullick on Wednesday condemned Amravati legislator Bacchu Kadu for abusing Nashik municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna on July 24 .

 Mullick had convened a meeting of the IAS association managing committee to discuss the future course of action to prevent attack on bureaucrats. The meeting was attended by MMRDA commissioner U P S Madan, additional chief secretary Medha Gadgil, governor’s secretary B Venugopal Reddy, O P Gupta, Asem Gupta, Parag Jain and Cidco managing director Bhushan Gagrani, who is also the association’s secretary. Abhishek Krishna, who addressed the meeting via video-conferencing, said there was no provocation from his side and he had adhered to protocol prescribed by the general administration department. A senior IAS association office bearer told TOI that the IAS officers across the state had condemned the attack on Krishna, a 2006-batch IAS officer. “We will submit a memorandum to the chief minister on Friday. We need protection from elected representative, otherwise it will be difficult to work,” he said.
 
 The members discussed as to who was the competent authority to act against errant elected representatives. One of the suggestions was that along with the CM, the IAS association should approach the presiding officers of both Houses.
