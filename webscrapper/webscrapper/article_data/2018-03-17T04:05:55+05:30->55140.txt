Noida: Traffic police have refused to stop the ongoing   against unregistered e-rickshaws and instead asked the vehicle owners to get new ones from authorised dealers. The owners, however, sought more time to get their vehicles registered.

 On Thursday, a drive against the e-rickshaws plying in the city without registration turned violent when a group of drivers pelted stones at the officers of the traffic police and the transport department. At least 100 unregistered e-rickshaws have been seized during this week.
 
 Traffic police suggested the drivers arrange for new vehicles from an authorised dealer and complete all formalities, including obtaining sales tax certificate and registration number, among others.
 
 A group of e-rickshaw drivers on Friday morning met SP (traffic) and sought more time from him to get the vehicles registered. 
 
 However, the transport department, which has completed its target of registering 1,000 e-rickshaws till February, has stopped the registration process so far, they alleged.
 
 ARTO (administration) Arunendra Pandey said they will register only genuine vehicles which are bought from dealers who get the vehicles certified by the   (ARAI). It has released a list of 48 authorised dealers that sell e-rickshaws in the district.
 
 SP (traffic)   said that they will not give any more time to these drivers as they had been extending their time limit since August last year but offered to help them finance new vehicles on cheaper loan.
 
 “We have given them multiple chances but they have not acted positively. We have offered to help them get cheaper loans for their vehicles from banks. It is up to them to decide. Our drive will continue,” he said.
