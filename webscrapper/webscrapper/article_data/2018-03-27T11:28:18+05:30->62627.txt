VADODARA: A day after communal rioting broke out in the old city during the Ram Navami procession, the City police arrested seven persons for indulging in violence on Monday. 

 Police have identified 34 persons from both the communities and filed FIR against them. 
 
 “The search is on for the other rioters who have been identified. We will take their statements and then nab more miscreants,” city police inspector   said. 
 
 According to the police, trouble broke out when the Ram Navami procession was passing from Mitha Faliya in  . Close to 50 persons threw stones on the procession following which the devotees too hit back with stones and the situation turned for worst.
 
 Three persons, including two policemen, suffered injuries in the stone-pelting that continued for sometime. When the procession reached Fatehpura crossroads, another round of stone pelting broke out, forcing the cops to lob nearly 30 teargas shells and lathi-charge the mobs. 
 
 Additional police force rushed to the spot and took control of the situation. The rioters damaged some roadside carts and auto rickshaws parked near the road. 
 
 Many shopkeepers also downed the shutters and fled from the area. When the procession reached Padmavati Complex, minor stone pelting was reported there as well. City police commissioner  , too, visited the old city areas to take stock of the situation. The cops are scanning CCTV footages to identify more rioters. Patrolling was increased in Fatehpura and adjacent areas late on Sunday night. The rioting left the cops surprised as the Ram Navami processions usually pass off peacefully in the city every year.
