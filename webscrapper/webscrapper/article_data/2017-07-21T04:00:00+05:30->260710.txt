Surat: Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) authorities are a worried lot ever since a complaint of sexual harassment surfaced on the campus sometime ago. The reason behind their worry is that two associate professors were found guilty of harassing girl students in 2015 and had to be dismissed and now comes this issue. The institute authorities have been unable to decide in the past few months whether to consider it as a case of sexual harassment or not even as they refused to divulge its details on Thursday.

 “I don’t want to share any details about the issue,” said director, SVNIT, S R Gandhi. In-charge registrar D P Vakharia also refused to comment. He said, “I cannot give any details as the inquiry is on in the issue.” SVNIT governing council chairman Jaya Panvalkar was not available for her comments. The then director and in-charge registrar had in 2015 too kept the complaints of the students under cover for a long period and only after the issue was highlighted by TOI did the Internal Complaint Committee asked to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry in the present case is being done by Women’s Cell. SVNIT sources said the complaint relates to an incident that took place a year ago. The complaint has been made by a temporary woman employee against a daily wage employee. The sources said the complaint was a part of the authorities’ plan to put pressure on daily wage workers who keep launching movements against the institute for acceptance of their demands. However, things will get clear once the institute authorities reveal details about the case.
 
 The daily wage workers had played an important role in the 2015 protest against the two associate professors who were found guilty of sexually harassing girl students and dismissed.
