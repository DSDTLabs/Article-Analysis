AHMEDABAD: Five years ago,  , then 11 years old, went   from Anandnagar. Viswa was last reported right below the building in which she lived.   have relaunched the search for her this year, as there are   in the case.

  However, there are 1,135 children (aged 0 to 18 years) reported missing in past 16 months (January to December 2016 and January to April 2017) who are yet to be traced. Nearly half of the missing children are girls.
 
 CID (crime) officials said that because of several rounds of Operation Smile, launched especially to look at angles unexplored by the local police, the ratio of finding the missing children have improved compared to past years. “Moreover, we have expanded our search to nearby states. Recently, 10 boys from the state were brought back from Mumbai,” said a CID (crime) official.
 
 Activists, however, say there’s much to be done. Sanjay Joshi, founder of Search My Child, said that there should be proper investigation of the incidents such as recent disappearance of children from a Kutch organization. Raju Solanki, founder of Dalit Haq Rakshak Manch, added that issues such as CCTV coverage at bus depots and railway stations should be taken up on priority.
