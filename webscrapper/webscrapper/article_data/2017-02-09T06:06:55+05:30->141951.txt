GANDHINAGAR: Union ministry of road transport and highways has given its final approval to the Gujarat government’s long-pending proposal for development of 44-km-stretch of the   highway at the cost of Rs750 crore. The central government has also approved the state government’s proposal for construction of seven new flyovers and six-laning of 19-km-stretch of the highway that has not yet been widened. 

 It is estimated that a minimum of one lakh PCUs (Passenger Car Units) use the SG highway daily. During festivals and on Mondays and Tuesdays, there is a sharp jump in the volume of traffic on this road.
 
  Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister and state’s minister of roads and buildings, said that the central government had given final approval to the plan to build seven new flyovers on the SG highway and completion of six-laning of the road. 
 
 “The total cost of the project will be around Rs750 crore,” Patel said. “The entire cost will be borne by the Centre but implementation of the project will be done by the state government.”
 
 The deputy CM further said that the state government had requested the Centre to keep the SG highway a toll-free road.
 
 “We made this request because most of the highway development work done by the   is on the basis of earning from road toll recovering the cost,” Patel said. “But the SG highway links Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar and lakhs of people use it every day. Hence we requested the central government to keep it toll-free. In a recent letter, Union minister   accepted our proposal.”
 
 Tenders for the new flyovers will be floated soon and the flyovers are likely to be ready in 2 to 2.5 years, Patel said.
 
 The deputy CM further said that the flyover at Pakvan road junction will be on the SG Highway only and there will be no flyover between Judges Bunglow to  .”
