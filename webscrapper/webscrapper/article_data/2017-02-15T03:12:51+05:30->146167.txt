NEW DELHI: Having lost the case on its   guidelines, AAP government is planning to file an appeal in the division bench of the high court seeking a stay on the current interim order. 

 Education minister Manish   said the government might also approach Supreme Court if push comes to shove. “We will approach the HC double bench. If private schools are not involved in misdoings, they must prove their transparency,” he said. 
 
 Sources said the re-appeal may be filed by next week, seeking a stay on the current interim order. If the division bench stays the order, the matter will go back to being in limbo as before. However, the government plans to get a concrete decision before March 7, when the first list is expected to be released.
 
 Meanwhile, Directorate of Education has said it will abide by the court decision.
