TIRUNELVELI: The eighth edition of the Tamirabarani   ( ) will begin on January 25. ATREE’s Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre ( ) is joining hands with the District Science Centre, Tirunelveli, Pearl City Nature Society (PCNS),  , Nellai Nature Club (NNC),   and Coromandel Coastal Conservation Trust, Ramanathapuram to conduct the bird counting exercise this year.

 During this edition, the TWC is extended to the neighbouring districts of Kanyakumari and Ramanathapuram, according to organisers. The Kanyakumari district is the water rich area among southern districts and Ramanathapuram is one of the driest and has five bird sanctuaries. Last year, due to severe drought only 8,256 birds were recorded in Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts compared to over 30,000 recorded in normal years.
 
 “Extending TWC to the neighbouring districts will help us understand how birds locally move in the southern districts to cope with drought and floods and engage with local communities in conducting the water bird census,” coordinator at ACCC, M   said.
 
 The exercise will begin on January 25 afternoon with an orientation programme at district science centre, Tirunelveli and the volunteers will cover Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts on January 26 and 27, Ramanathapuram district on January 28 and Kanyakumari district on January 29. Interested bird experts and volunteers can contact ACCC via email, mathi@atree.org or mobile phone 9488063750. Registrations will close on January 22.
