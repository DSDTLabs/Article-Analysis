Chandigarh: Soon, the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR) website will be accessible to persons with disabilities, especially blind persons. The institute website is adding facilities as per the standards of W3C, according to which the accessibility option should be provided to those who find reading difficult. 

 Dr Maitreyee Dutta, principal investigator of the project, said the website is in the final stages and will be accessible to people by February-end. She said features that will be added to the website will make accessibility easier for the blind and partially blind. According to her, the project has been funded by the ministry of social justice and empowerment, Government of India. The institute, she said, received Rs 79 lakh for the project, under which the institute infrastructure will also be made disabled-friendly. 
 
 The project is aimed at carrying out works related under SIPDA (scheme for implementation of Persons with Disabilities Act). Under the project, the institute will provide a barrier-free environment in all buildings of the institute, like lifts for vertical conveyance, renovation of toilets and construction of ramps. Various accessibility features on the website will help persons with disabilities access the institute website. The institute will also set up a resource centre for persons with disabilities, with various software applicable to them.
 
 Dr Maitreyee Dutta said construction work has already been completed on the campus and the website will be available to blind and partially blind persons soon. She said there will be a screen reader facility on the modified website so that the matter is dictated to the blind person as and when he or she opens it.
