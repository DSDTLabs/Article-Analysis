Actress   Ghoshal, who is mostly seen in character roles, plays the second lead in the Trisha-starrer, 1818. The film, directed by debutant  , is said to be a thriller, which is set against the backdrop of 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Talking about the project, she says, 'I actually joined the set to work on the Hindi dialogues of the film. I later joined as the assistant director. Recently, they offered me an important role in the film, too, which will be more like a second lead. Having done character roles earlier, my role is crucial to the subject.'

 Meesha says she enjoyed the filmmaking process. 'I never got stuck to doing one particular thing. I have worked as an assistant director for two films earlier. I want to explore cinematography and art direction, too,' she says. After playing character roles in films like   and Vadacurry, Meesha says that she doesn't have any qualms about essaying such roles. 'When I entered films, I wasn't too serious about it as I had something else going on for me. As I started doing films, I began liking them. That's one of the reasons why I explored the process of filmmaking, too. After playing supporting roles, I got to play the lead in Mooch and Unnodu Ka. If I get to be a part of good films and get the right roles, I will take it up,' she says.
