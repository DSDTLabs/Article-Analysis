CHENNAI:After a five-yeardelay, the government is all set to begin installation of GPS-fitted digital meters, which have inbuilt printers and panic buttons, in 43,000 autos in the city in the first phase.

 
  
 
 
 The roll-out comes after a demonstration showed reasonable success in tracking the autosby thecontrolcentre setup by thetransportdepartmentin Anna Nagar.The new digital meters, which works on the same line as those used by app-based cab aggregators like Ola and Uber, use GPS to estimate the fare based on the distance travelled, a senior transportdepartmentofficial toldTOI.Afare receiptis generatedby a printer attachedto thedevice.
 
 The meter alsohas a panic button as a security measure. When pressed, the alarm signal will reach the nearest police station. The vehicles will be monitored by the control centre — which will also handle complaints — on a live GPS map.
 
 The new modeldoes not allow drivers to run autorickshaws without switching on the meter and sends out a warning beep to the control centre if the autos are operated on the sly without running the meter, the official added. The cost of the project, announced in 2013, has shot up from ?80croreto?109 crore.
 
 After being cancelled twice, tenders were floated again last year and New Delhi-based Rosmerta Technologies Limited bagged the contract to manufacture the meters and monitor operations.
