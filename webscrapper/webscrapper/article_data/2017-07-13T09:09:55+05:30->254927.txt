 "If she said she don't want to travel no more, I'll say, okay, my career is over. It's as simple as that," the 35-year-old said of his wife, who is a prominent feature courtside during his matches. "She's the key to a lot of this. But she's happy to be doing it, not on a weekly basis because the traveling gets too much with the four (two sets of twins)."
 
 "Mirka has been amazing support for me. She's the best," Federer, hugely popular with fans around the world, said.

"I think it's great that these coaches can work more their job. It's more interesting to the fans. I don't see why not," she said.
 
 The Russian explained that the changes were being made to spice up the game, not necessarily to benefit players.
