RUDRAPUR: Classes have been disrupted in as many as 50 government schools in Jaspur in   district after power supply to the institutes was disconnected due to non-payment of bills that amount to Rs 40 lakh.
 
  The power cut left students without water supply which is dependent on electric motors while many schools were unable to hold classes as fans were not functional and the temperatures ran high. The day’s temperature in the area was 38 degrees Celsius on Friday.
  
  The Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited ( ) officials said that they were forced to disconnect power supply on Thursday because the schools had not paid electricity dues for two years.
  
  Executive engineer of UPCL in Jaspur, Ajit Kumar Yadav, told TOI, “The electricity dues of these schools are worth Rs 40 lakh. Despite several notices served in the past two years, the education department did not make the payment so we had to disconnect the power supply.”
  
  Education department officials said that UPCL had acted in haste and without caring for thousands of children.
  
  Block education officer at Jaspur, Anil Kumar, said, “Such a step can discourage parents from sending their children to schools. We have informed the project director of the   about the situation.”
  
  Chief education officer (US Nagar), P N Singh, added, “We had communicated to the directorate (education) in Dehradun twice this year for release of funds so bills could be cleared. We are hopeful of getting the funds soon. In the meantime, we will request UPCL to restore power supply so children’s studies are not hampered.”
