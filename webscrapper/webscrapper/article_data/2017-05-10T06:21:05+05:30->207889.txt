CHANDIGARH: Close on the heels of the Congress appointing  , a   president, the   (AAP) has elevated its prominent Hindu leader Aman Arora as co-president of the   

 “AAP has tried to do a balancing act with Arora’s appointment. He is a Hindu face and enjoys good equation with HS Phoolka and Sanjay Singh,” said an AAP leader. However, according to a Congress leader, Arora’s appointment seems to be a reaction to the success of the Congress in making inroads into the Hindu vote bank in the 2017 assembly polls. “Some even see it as an attempt to brace up for anticipating a possibility of the BJP going alone in the next assembly elections,” said a Congress leader.
 
 The trend of fielding more Hindu candidates was started in the 2012 Assembly Elections by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), traditionally a Sikh Panthic party. SAD named around 10 Hindu contestants most of whom came up trumps. Among them, Prem Mittal beat Gurpreet Kaur Gagowal in the Mansa constituency considered a Congress bastion. The Congress nominee in Bathinda (Urban) Harminder Singh Jassi lost to SAD’s Hindu face Saroop Chand Singla. Parkash Chand Garg of SAD defeated Surinder Pal Singh Sibia of Congress in Sangrur. 
 
 Coming back to the Congress, the leader said it had already made up its mind to have a Hindu for the top post after Captain Amarinder Singh took the reins of the chief minister. “Even though, senior vice president Lal Singh was seen as a strong contender and leaders like Manish Tewari and Ashwani Sekhri too were hopeful, Jakhar eventually pipped them to the top job,” said the leader.
