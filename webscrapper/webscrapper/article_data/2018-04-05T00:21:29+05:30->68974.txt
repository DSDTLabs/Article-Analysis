Trichy: A warring faction exacted revenge on a member of the rival group by thrashing him to death with a cricket bat, near Adiramipattinam in Thanjavur district on Tuesday. The deceased was identified as Ganesan, 41, who hailed from Naduvikkadu village.

 Police said that a previous enmity between two factions from different villages led to the murder of Ganesan. Adiramipattinam police registered a case against the eight accused who are on the run, and conducted an investigation.
 
 Reports suggested that a faction in the village harboured a long-standing enmity with a rival group from a nearby village Pudukottai Ullur. Both factions had earlier filed complaints against each other at Adiramipattinam police station.
 
 It is learnt that Ganesan, who was standing at Adiramipattinam bus stand on Tuesday night, was confronted by a few of the rival members. Later, a quarrel broke out between them with the group finally attacking Ganesan with cricket bat.
 
 He suffered severe head injury, and though he was taken to the Pattukottai government hospital for treatment, the doctors pronounced him brought dead. 
 
 Sources said that his relatives upon hearing the news of his death pelted stones at buses in Pudukottai and vandalised a few shops in the area.
