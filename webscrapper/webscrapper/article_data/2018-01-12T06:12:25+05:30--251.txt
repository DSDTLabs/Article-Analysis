Mumbai: The   ( ) has struck down IRDAI’s order forcing a transfer of Sahara’s life insurance business to  .

 While passing the order, the tribunal directed the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( ) to proceed from the stage of seeking a representation/response from   on the administrator’s report in question, as well as providing the company and its stake holders an opportunity to be heard, in consonance with the principles of natural justice.
 
 “The regulator will abide by SAT’s order and hear the appeal of Sahara Life afresh after providing a copy of the administrators report,” said IRDAI member Nilesh Sathe — who is in charge of finance and accounts. IRDAI has also been directed to complete the hearing within three months from the date of receipt of Sahara’s reply to the administrator’s report in question.
 
 Sahara, meanwhile, said that it has received a major respite and its stance was vindicated by SAT. However, the tribunal has not stayed the appointment of an administrator or the freeze on writing new business.
 
 IRDAI had sought to transfer Sahara Life’s business on the grounds of governance. Sources said that Sahara Life was not financially strained as the company had a solvency margin higher than what was prescribed by the regulator. Also, the company was hardly doing any new business. In July 2017, IRDAI had asked ICICI Pru Life to take over the business of Sahara Life with effect from July 31, 2017. The regulator had said that there was total failure of the governance system of Sahara India Life and interests of the policyholders were at stake. IRDAI had declared the promoters as being no more ‘fit and proper’ and alleged that a sum of Rs 78 crore was siphoned off in name of security deposits.
