NEW DELHI: Riding on the high of a super past year, ace pistol shooter   enters the 2018   to be held at   City, in the southeast of the Australian state of Queensland from April 4-15, as one of the big bets for a medal. 

 
 
 
 Heena - who last month was crowned with the Shooter of the Year Award at the third Mahindra Scorpio Times of India Awards (TOISA) - is coming off a successful 2017. Her success included three gold medals and another at the Commonwealth   Championships. Paired with Jitu Rai, she won the 10m mixed team air pistol event at the ISSF World Cup in Delhi, the ISSF World Cup Rifle/Pistol series in Gabala, Azerbaijan and ISSF World Cup final. Individually, Sidhu won a gold medal in the 10m air pistol event at the Commonwealth Shooting Championships and bronze medals at the 10th Asian Championship and the Grand Prix of Liberation Plaza Shooting Championships in the Czech Republic. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The 28-year-old has made two trips to the Commonwealth Games in 2010 - winning a gold in the team 10m air pistol event and silver in the individual 10m air pistol - and 2014 where she qualified for the 10m final but failed to leave a mark. 
 
 
 
 
 Outside of the   arena, Heenaâ€™s career graph includes several highs. In 2010 she won silver at the Guangzhou Asian Games; in 2013, at the ISSF World Cup Finals in Munich, she shot for a world record score that fetched her a gold medal; in 2014, she shot silver at the ISSF World Cup and added another feather in her cap when she became the first Indian female pistol shooter to scale the World No 1 ranking.
