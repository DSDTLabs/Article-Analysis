BENGALURU: The postmortem of the Nigerian national, who died under mysterious circumstances during a police operation in north Bengaluru on March 13, will be conducted on the next available day, said police. 

 The decision comes after a no-objection certificate (NOC) was issued by the Nigerian embassy which failed to locate Nduka Ifeayani Christian's family. This means, after the postmortem, the Nigerian's body will be buried by the authorities in Karnataka. 
 
 Praveen Sood, city police commissioner, said an officer was sent to the Nigerian embassy and the NOC was secured. "We had written and called the embassy several times for the NOC, but there was no response. Considering that the body was in the morgue for more than a week, we sent an officer to Delhi, who secured the letter," he said. 
 
 According to documents from the   (FRRO), Nduka was born in 1981 and came to Bengaluru in 2009 on a student visa. 
 
 His visa expired in 2012; documents recovered from his house show no proof of renewal. Nduka was living in  , southeast Bengaluru, and worked as a helper in a small hotel in the locality. His companion, who was with him on the night of the incident, is yet to be traced, though.
 
 Even though there have been several controversies surrounding his death, the postmortem is yet to be done. "Even though we have not been able to contact the family, now that we have an NOC from the embassy, we will be conducting the autopsy," Sood added.
