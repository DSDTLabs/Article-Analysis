Only few know to bring retro alive on screen; and   will surely find a place in the list. In his ' ', the director-composer has come up with 12 songs, each one with its own unique flavour, reminding listeners of the jazzy 40s. The album begins with 'Bloody Hell', with Hinglish lyrics by Gulzar.   is at her naughty best, modulating her tone to suit the temperament of the song and complementing the eccentricities of Kangana Ranaut’s character. The saxophone and keys arrangement stand out and the chorus is in sync. 
'Yeh Ishq Hai' has heavy Sufi influences and is capable of lulling you into your comfort zone. This song has two versions — while Arijit Singh nails it with his rendition, Rekha Bhardwaj’s is earthier, slower and has classical touches. 'Mere Miyan Gaye England' is Vishal’s ode to the evergreen 'Mere Piya Gaye Rangoon'. Doing full justice to the wacky lyrics is Rekha’s playful delivery and part-folk beats. 
 Through 'Tippa', Sukhwinder Singh, OS Arun, Sunidhi and Rekha chug you along on a whimsical journey. The way Vishal has infused the rhythm of the train and the sound of rainfall is quite magical. 'Ek Dooni Do by Rekha is a foot-tapping number with Spanish influences. Arijit strikes again with 'Alvida', and in this song about the pains of separation, his voice is the hero. After a pensive saxophone interlude, we like how the intensity of the orchestration builds up, only to take backseat in the end. Sukhwinder, KK and Kunal Ganjawalla lift 'Julia', but it would probably excite us more with the visuals. 'Chori Chori' has its retro feel intact. The 'Rangoon Theme' is haunting, with the harmonica giving it an Oriental touch. 'Be Still' by   and 'Shimmy Shak'e by Vivienne Pocha have both been written by Lekha Washington. While the former is a ballad kind of number, the latter is an interesting take on rock n roll. This album might not be a stand-out, but it captures the essence of the 40s like no other.
