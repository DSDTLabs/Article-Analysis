PUNE: A Kothrud police team led by senior inspector   on Tuesday   Santosh Shelar, right hand man of gangster Gajanan alias Gaja Marne.

 A countrymade pistol and three cartridges were recovered from him.
 
 Shelar has 12 cases registered against him, that include two murders, two attempts to murder, body offences and dacoity preparation, Phuge said.
 
 He added sub-inspector Vikramsinh Rajput received a tip-off that Shelar and his accomplice Shekhar Adkar had come to Kothrud in a car and were carrying firearms. “Our team rushed to the spot and laid a trap,” Phuge said.
 
 Adkar fled the spot as soon as he spotted the police. “However, we nabbed Shelar before he could escape. We have recovered a pistol and three cartridges from him,” Phuge said.
 
 Sub-inspector Rajput said prima facie investigations revealed that Shelar and Adkar had come there to sell the pistol. “We have also seized the car,” Rajput said.
 
 Phuge said Shelar had been running the Marne gang as the Gajanan Marne is in the prison. “We are investigating from where Shelar had obtained the firearm,” Phuge said.
