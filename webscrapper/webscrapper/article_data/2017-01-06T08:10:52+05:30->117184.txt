KANPUR: BSP’s Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Siddharth visited the city on Wednesday to review monthly meeting of the party's co-ordinators of the division. 

 Later, addressing a meeting of the party workers, he said that   was number one party and that all the parties were far behind it. “Except BSP, no other party had the courage to finalise the names of party candidates for UP elections”, he said. 
 
 He asked the party workers to strictly follow all norms of the   (EC). Attacking BJP, SP and Congress he said that Behenji would be able to form the government without taking support of any political party. 
 
 He also assailed PM   and said the sharp edge in his speeches was missing in his recent public rallies held in Kanpur and Lucknow because he knew that people were not happy with the BJP's government at the Centre.
 
 The BSP MP even mocked at the Congress by saying that this party is like a drowning ship in which no one wants to sail. Attacking  , he said, “ How a party which cannot settle differences in the family, will be able to take care of the people of UP”. 
 
 Talking to mediapersons about the BSP’s agenda, he said that the party's agenda is ‘Bahujan Hitai, Bahujan Sukhai’. “This policy of BSP can be clearly seen in distribution of tickets as people of all castes, religions and communities have been taken care of and given tickets by Behenji,” he added.
