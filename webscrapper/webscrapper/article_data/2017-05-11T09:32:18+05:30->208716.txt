THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health minister   told the assembly on Wednesday that the government has issued orders to   facilitating   to follow strict procedures "to allay doubts on   and to   on brain death". 

 "As per the guidelines issued, a team of four doctors would be required to declare a patient brain dead. Two of the doctors in the team should be from outside the particular hospital and one among them has to be from a panel of government doctors. Repeated examination should be conducted with a gap of six hours to make sure that the patient is brain dead, and these examinations have to be recorded on video," the minister said.
 
 The minister, replying to a calling attention motion by IUML MLA  , said the government will take appropriate measures to detect and initiate strict actions against any unethical practices.
 
 The health minister, however, said there were "false campaigns" and rumours doing the rounds to discourage organ donation. The Kerala Network for Organ Sharing (KNOS), the government agency handling organ transplantation involving deceased donors under the Mrithasanjeevani programme, will initiate awareness programmes to allay such fears.
 
 "Actor Mohanlal is already the goodwill ambassador of Mrithasanjeevani, and the department has also come out with a touching short film on the organ donation which is expected to encourage the concept," she said.
 
 On the organ donation by living donors, Shylaja said the government was strictly following the central Act which allows one to donate to relatives and in special instances of charity. "We have three zonal authorisation committees which are entrusted with the task of inspecting and approving such donations," she added.
