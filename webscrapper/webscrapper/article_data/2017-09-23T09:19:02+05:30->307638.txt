PATNA: Acting on a directive issued by the state education department, the   (PU) administration issued a notification on Friday asking   principal Rakesh Verma to retire from service with retrospective effect from September 30, 2016, the date on which he had completed 62 years of age.

 The notification said Verma would be deemed to have retired from the date on which he completed 62 years as he was then a non-teaching employee of the university as per provisions of the University Amendment Act, 2012. The new University Amendment Act, 2017 which declared principals as teachers once again became effective from May 18, 2017, said PU sources.
 
 Other universities in the state are also likely to follow the suit and make such principals retire from the date on which they had completed 62 years before the promulgation of the new Act.

 : Delivering an extra-mural lecture on ‘Chemistry in medicine and cosmetics’ at PU chemistry department here on Friday, Lucknow University chemistry professor   said several elements which are supposed to be very toxic and harmful for human beings also serve very useful purposes when used in moderate amount. “Everybody knows that arsenic causes cancer, but very few people know that arsenic also cures cancer patients. Toxic elements like mercury and lead also serve some useful purposes at times,” Raj said. He, however, cautioned the people against their indiscriminate use. PU vice-chancellor   inaugurated the lecture series and the university’s chemistry department head Radha Kant Prasad introduced the theme.
