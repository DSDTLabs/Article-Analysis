HYDERABAD: Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation ( ) is mulling to resume 18 acres of unutilised land from Hyderabad Gems   Limited, owned by Punjab National Bank loan fraud accused Mehul Choksi’s Gitanjali Group. It has sought legal opinion to resume the precious land at Ravirayala near Shamshabad airport for failing to create promised jobs.

 TSIIC sources said 95-acre   limited had failed to generate jobs as per an MoU and all the five companies in the SEZ put together could provide 576 jobs.
 
 According to Union government’s SEZ Office, proposed direct employment at Hyderabad SEZ was 5,017 as per the MoU signed in 2007. However, the SEZ could provide employment to only 576 people, including 302 women in 2016-17. It had also promised to provide indirect employment to 2000 individuals, but only 120 were employed at Hyderabad Gems SEZ.
 
 Though through a series of orders, government had decreased the proposed number of jobs, Hyderabad SEZ has failed to create jobs even those jobs.
 
 In 2014, the Comptroller and Auditor General, in the report on preforming of SEZ, said AP government had in June 2007 signed an MoU with a condition to generate employment for 15,000 people within five years of allotment of land and the clause was relaxed and decreased to 10,000 jobs in February, 2010 through a government order. However, as of March 2014, the employment generated was only 3,835, around 38% of the commitment.
 
 TSIIC is now working on resuming the unutilised 18-acre land, citing the failure to generate employment clause.
