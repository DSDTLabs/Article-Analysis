CHENNAI: The working class community in  , Perambur, has been put to great inconvenience due to the non-functioning of corporation toilets in the neighbourhood for the last six months. The toilet was locked up after the borewell in use dried up. Corporation officials had inspected the problem at least thrice, but to no avail. 

 An official, who inspected the defunct borewell earlier this month, said, "The borewell which was in operation dried up due to a drop in groundwater table. We will replace the borewell soon." 
 
 Residents, however, are not optimistic. Of the 700-odd homes in Arundhati Nagar, only around 100 have toilets. For a population of 5,000 residing in 12 streets and four bylanes, there are three sets of male/female toilets.
 
 The toilets in   and Govindan Street have been operational but the toilets in Sengan Street have been shut for six months. "The borewell in Govindan Street dried up two years ago, but it was replaced in time. For six months, officials have been assuring us that the toilets in Sengan Street will be back in operation."
 
 Children are forced to defecate on the streets as the city corporation's plan to build a children's toilet has remained on paper for three years now. In an RTI reply to residents, the city corporation declared in 2015 that the plan to build the children's toilet had been approved and was awaiting cost estimates. The children's toilet was to come up in the place of an old, abandoned toilet in Sengan Street.
 
 Arundhati Nagar resident C B   said, "Officials told us that only Rs 3 lakh has been allotted for construction of the children's toilet. We had to make a request following which it was raised to Rs 10 lakh. But the money has not been put to use."
 
 The RTI reply further said that a gym will also be constructed near the children's toilet. An official said, "As it stands now, there is only a plan to construct a children's toilet. The work will be taken up soon and completed."
