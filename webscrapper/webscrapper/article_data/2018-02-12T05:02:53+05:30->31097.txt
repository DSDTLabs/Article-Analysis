ALWAR: An audio clip of   Gyan Dev   — allegedly blaming CM   and state BJP president Ashok   for the party’s loss in the recent bypolls — went viral on Sunday. Ahuja represents Alwar’s Ramgarh constituency.

 In the clip, Ahuja is allegedly heard speaking to one of his supporters over the phone after the party’s defeat in Alwar, Ajmer and Mandalgarh in the assembly elections. “Yeh to sarkar hari hai, hum thode hi hare ho (It is the government that has lost, not us),” the MLA says.
 
 Calling Raje, Parnami and Alwar candidate Jaswant Yadav ‘badnaam’ (infamous), Ahuja allegedly went on to claim that he had demanded a change of guard in the state and written to party general secretary   and BJP national president Amit Shah, asking them to replace both Raje and Parnami.
 
 “This was bound to happen. I had predicted that we will be routed in these elections. If Raje and Parnami are not replaced then BJP will suffer miserably in Rajasthan,” Ahuja is heard saying. He claims that he has no regret about BJP’s defeat. “Just wait and watch what happens in few days, I have nothing to say,” Ahuja told TOI, adding that it was indeed his voice in the recording.
