The regional transport authority in Gurugram issued a total of 157 challans against overloaded trucks in April, generating a revenue of Rs 49 lakh, according to officials.

 The   recently stepped up a drive against   of commercial vehicles. On May 2 alone, it issued challans amounting to Rs 10 lakh. “We have received instructions to step up the drive against overloaded vehicles, as they have been evading taxes,” said a senior official from the department. The official said the earlier practice of setting up checkposts to inspect vehicles used to discourage trade and impede traffic movement, so they removed checkposts and started inspecting vehicles at random. RTA officials said vehicles entering Gurugram exceed the load limits by 10-15 tonnes on an average. Under the recently-amended Motor Vehicles Act, they can be fined Rs 5,000 for carrying goods more than the prescribed capacity, and an additional Rs 2,000 per tonne. 
 
 Rs 49 lakh is the highest revenue generated by overloading   so far, and the department hopes to issue challans worth Rs 1 crore this month. RTA secretary RK Singh said the government recently gave the transport department the authority to challan vehicles for overloading, which was earlier handled by several departments, resulting in the rise. “We hope to attain the Rs 1 crore mark soon,” he said. tnn
