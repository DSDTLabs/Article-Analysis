 Sharing this information with TOI, civic chief   said, “PCMC has already issued notices to 1.13 lakh owners of commercial as well as residential establishments for recovery of property tax and penalty arrears. The notices have been issued to property holders with tax arrears of over Rs 5,000. We have also started sealing properties of defaulters with huge arrears.”
 
 He said the commercial establishments were the focus of the civic body. “The employees of property tax department are going to properties of big defaulters to seal them, but most of them are either making payments in cash or cheques or making partial payments and asking for time to clear their dues,”   added. 
 
 The civic chief said, “As per the government rules for regularization, owners of unauthorized constructions with less than 600sqft area will not be charged any penalty. However, owners of the unauthorized constructions having 601sqft-1,000sqft area will be charged half the penalty and those with area above 1,000sqft will have to pay the full penalty amount.”
 
 Having said that, the state government has not waived penalty and people with unauthorized constructions should clear their arrears, he added.
 
 As per the civic body, there are around one lakh unauthorized constructions in the city.
