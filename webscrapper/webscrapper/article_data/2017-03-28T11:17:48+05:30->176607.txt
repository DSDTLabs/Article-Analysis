VIJAYAWADA: It was an   which had turned to a nightmare. For the sake of her seven-year-old son   of studying medicine in the United State,   put up with physical and mental torture at the hands of her husband  . 

  "Had it not been for Anish, Sasikala would have returned to India a couple of years ago. I begged her to come back when she complained of physical abuse. As a father, I could not bear that my daughter was miles away from home and subjected to domestic violence,"   told TOI on Monday. 
 
  He said Anish was brilliant in his class. "He was a school topper and right from childhood, he used to tell his mom that he wanted to become a doctor," Venkata Rao said. 
 
  Unable to recover from the grief of the dastardly killings on Thursday last, mother Krishna Kumari said she regretted the day the marriage between Sasikala and Rao was fixed. She said the news of her son-in-law having an affair with a co-worker in New Jersey had shocked her. 
 
 Trouble began in 2012, two years after Anish was born. Sasikala came to know that her husband was having an illicit affair with Deepa. Soon, he stopped giving money to the family.
 
 In 2015, Sasikala asserted herself and opened a separate bank account with her salary. Her parents recalled that Hanumantha Rao did not even approve of Sasikala opening the bank account.
 
  "I telephoned him (Rao) a month ago and he did not pick up the call. My daughter told me that he would take my call when everything is over. He called me after a month to tell me that my daughter and grandson are dead. That was the last time I spoke to him," wailed Kumari.
