NEW DELHI: Army chief General Bipin   said on Thursday that India needs to spend much more on military modernisation to ensure its economic growth continues unhindered, while announcing that his force has prepared a national security strategy and a military strategic policy to deal with emerging security challenges. 

 Criticising thes lack of strategic culture in the country and "the general thinking" that expenditure on defence is "a burden", he said, "While we are developing our economy, the military is not getting its due share. I think here we need to draw a lesson from China."
 
 Speaking at a function at the United Service Institution, General Rawat said India must build stronger ties with countries like  , Iraq and   to create "a two-front scenario" for Pakistan, while actively pursuing the "Act East" policy to encircle the other neighbour. He said the time has come for India to have a say in all major issues at the UN.
