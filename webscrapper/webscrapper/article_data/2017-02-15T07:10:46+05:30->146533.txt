Over half-a-dozen special judges presided over the nine-year-long trial of former chief minister  , who died in December 2016, and her associates after the disproportionate assets case was transferred to Karnataka in 2003. On November 18, 2003, the Supreme Court transferred the case to a special court in Bengaluru, after DMK leader K Anbazhagan approached it saying a fair trial was not possible in Tamil Nadu. It took more than a year to start trial even though the Karnataka government sanctioned the establishment of the special court in December 2003, since most of the documents were in Tamil and had to be translated.

 The trial began in March 2005 under Justice A S Pachchapure. A major part of the trial was presided over by judges Antin, Mallikarjunaiah, M S Balakrishna, and finally, John Michael Cunha, who on September 27, 2014, convicted all four accused, Jayalalithaa, Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran. Two special public prosecutors argued the case for Karnataka -senior counsel BV Acharya, who later resigned, and G Bhavani Singh.
 
 Acharya returned as special public prosecutor during the final stages of hearing of the appeal before the Karnataka high court and continued when the state government appealed against the Karnataka high court verdict in the Supreme Court.
 
 Justice Pachchapure, who began hearing the disproportionate assets case, went on to become a high court judge and has retired. Justice Cunha is now a judge of the Karnataka high court.
