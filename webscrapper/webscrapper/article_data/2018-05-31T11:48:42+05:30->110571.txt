HYDERABAD: Family members of a woman patient, who died while undergoing treatment at  , assaulted a doctor on Tuesday night, blaming the hospital's negligence for her death. 

 
 The attack on the doctor, Irfan, sparked spontaneous protests from resident doctors, who boycotted duties on Wednesday. Aruna (46) of Medipally, who was admitted to NIMS on May 19 with multiple organ failure, died while undergoing treatment. Attendants picked up a heated argument with Irfan and assaulted him. 
 
 "When Aruna's family members turned aggressive, Irfan began running but they chased him and attacked him,"   inspector Ravinder said. Hospital security staff came to Irfan's rescue when he raised an alarm. They stopped Aruna's family members.
 
 The episode of the doctor running and the patient's family members chasing him were captured on CCTV. Based on a complaint of Irfan, a case was registered. But, the patient's kin also filed a complaint alleging that they were attacked by security staff. 
 
 The Resident Doctors' Association said Aruna was on ventilator support in ICU ever since she came to NIMS on May 19. 
 
 "Aruna was a rheumatology patient and was having severe lung problems. Since it was a high-risk case, we explained her condition to the attendants. She collapsed around 10 pm on Tuesday in the course of treatment following which five men attacked our rheumatology resident doctor Dr Irfan who was on duty at the time. The doctor is unable to move his right shoulder," said Dr P srinivas, member of RDA and president of Junior Doctors Association.
