MUMBAI:   has reported as many as 389 farmer suicides in the first two months of the year, revealed the revenue department updated figures. 

 As many as 203 cases–52% of the total–are from the Vidarbha region from where chief minister Devendra Fadnavis hails.
 
 The figures are lower than the 480 cases reported during the same two-month span last year, when the   was in the grip of a severe drought. Subsequently, the state experienced a good monsoon.
 
 The Vidarbha and Marathwada regions have reported the highest number of cases in January and February this year. Of the 203 cases in Vidarbha, as many as 174 are from the cotton belt of Amravati while 29 cases have been reported from the Nagpur region.
 
 The Marathwada region reported 134 cases or 34% of the total, North Maharashtra (42) and the sugar cane-rich Western Maharashtra (10). Not a single case has been reported from the Konkan region in these two months. The opposition has been demanding a farm loan waiver, a key issue during the current assembly session. However, the state has refused to grant it saying it would cost Rs 30,500 crore and that the earlier waiver did not stem the suicides. Instead, the state’s budget has announced funds for farm and irrigation schemes.
 
 Farm leaders say that government has not done enough to address the critical issue of pricing. “As a result of the good monsoon, the crop has improved but prices have slumped as a result. In the case of tur dal, the market price is down from Rs 5,050 to 4,200 per quintal,” says farming activist Vijay Jawandhia.
 
 Kishor Tiwari, who heads the state’s Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Svawalamban mission, said the provision of fresh credit to farmers remained a key issue.
