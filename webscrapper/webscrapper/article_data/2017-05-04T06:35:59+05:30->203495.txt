MUMBAI: Even as Catholics are protesting the recent demolition of a   on Bazaar Road in Bandra, an incident of desecration of a   was reported in Kalina in Santacruz (east) on Wednesday. 

 Within two hours of the incident, the Vakola police arrested a habitual thief and drug addict, Suresh Balaji Gadge. During interrogation, Gadge has told the police that he threw a stone and broke the statue to steal a   on it.
 
 When locals of Kolivery village in Kalina woke up, they were shocked to see the statue desecrated. A huge mob gathered at the spot and residents raised concern over the increase in the number of such incidents in the city.
 
 "We see a definative pattern in such incidents in Santacruz, Bandra, Juhu and Kurla. This has been done with deliberate intentions of hurting the religious sentiments of the Christain community," said Pimenta Godfrey. 
 
 After the locals approached the police, an offence of hurting religious sentiments was registered. "Luckily, a CCTV camera installed in a nearby building had captured the accused in the act. Locals immediately identified him. We arrested him in the afternoon," said Mahadev Vavale, senior inspector of Vakola police station. 
 
 Police said Gadge has been externed from the city limits earlier and that there are four offences of theft against him. He was recently released on bail. 
 
 In February, two accused were arrested for desecration of a Mother Mary statue near Hall Road in Kurla. The two accused had tried to steal a necklace thinking it to be of gold. One of the accused later told the police that they had done so to bail out his father who had been arrested in a theft case.
