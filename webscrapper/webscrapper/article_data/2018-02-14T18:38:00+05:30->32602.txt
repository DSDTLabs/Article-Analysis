CHENNAI: A man bludgeoned a 30-year-old software engineer in the head with an iron rod, knocking the woman off her scooter and leaving her with multiple facial fractures, before escaping with her   chain, cellphone and twowheeler in an astonishingly brutal and daring attack in Arasankazhani, just 2km from the IT Corridor, around 2.20am on Tuesday.

 “A passerby found the woman at 4am and alerted the police control room,” he said. “After knocking her off the bike, the assailant dragged her across the road to a bush, perhaps to avoid being spotted while he ripped off her three sovereign gold chain and grabbed her phone.”
 
 The woman was in critical condition in hospital. Bloodspattered rocks and tracks on the tar from the assailant dragging the woman across the road were still at the scene of the crime, near a building under construction, more than 14 hours later.
 
 Tuesday’s attack marked a high point in a recent spurt in violent crime in the city and took place two years, to the day, after three migrant workers raped and killed  , 24, an employee of   in Siruseri.
 
 Lavanya, who lives in a rented house in  , left her company on   Salai after her shift at 2am, investigators said, adding that she could have been heading to her sister’s house in   near   when the man took her by surprise.
