BAREILLY: A slew of resignations has caught the   off guard. A day after the party’s zonal coordinator Brahma Swaroop Sagar resigned, several candidates and top leaders in the region, including   assembly candidate Rajendra Gupta and Nawabganj assembly candidate Virendra Singh Gangwar, resigned on Monday evening. The party candidate from Aonla assembly seat,  , had put in his papers late on Sunday night.

  Sources told TOI that several other office bearers may also quit in the coming days and that the process seems to have started after the ouster of BSP’s Muslim face Naseemuddin Siddiqui along with his son  .
 
  The disgruntled leaders claimed that the party’s politics led to its crushing defeat in the recently held assembly elections and that there has been no brainstorming over the new course of action. “The party supremo ( ) was busy auctioning tickets and minting money while its core vote base eroded due to sheer neglect. We don’t see any merit in EVM tampering accusations which were used as a cover up for the humiliating loss,” Cantt assembly candidate Rajendra Gupta said.
 
  Some of the leaders also backed the allegations leveled against Mayawati by Siddiqui. “The role of a zonal coordinator had turned into that of a collection agent who would go about collecting money after auctioning tickets. There was no focus on strengthening the cadre base at the ground level,” former zonal coordinator Brahma Swaroop Sagar told TOI.
  Meanwhile, the remaining BSP district leadership was on the defensive. “We had been getting instructions from the state leadership and Brahma Swaroop Sagar’s resignation came just before of his expulsion. We are trying to reach out to other office bearers,” BSP district president   told TOI.
