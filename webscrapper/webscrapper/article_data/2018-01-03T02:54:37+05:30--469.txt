GREATER NOIDA:   brothers, one of whom is six years old, were shot at after a fight over a petty issue in Dankaur in Greater Noida.

 Pintu (6) was shot at in his head while his elder brother Bholu (20) was shot in the leg when a youth in the neighbourhood started firing at them during a fight between the two families.
 
 Dankaur SHO Farmood Ali Pundir told TOI, “There was a fight between the families over keeping fodder in a ruined godown. One of the families apparently kept fodder in the godown, which is a government property that is not being used. However, the other party objected to this and a fight broke out.”
 
 Both the injured boys have been admitted to the Kailash Hospital in Greater Noida where their condition is said to be serious. However, police said they have not received any complaint from either of the two parties till the time this story was being filed. A team of police has been deployed in the area as a precautionary measure.
