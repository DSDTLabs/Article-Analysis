KOCHI: Questioning the need for 12 DGPs in the state, a single bench of the court asked whether their appointments were as per law. The criticism by the judge was while considering a petition filed by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, questioning the case over UDF government's decision to promote IPS officer N Shanker Reddy to DGP rank and appoint him as the director of vigilance and anticorruption bureau ( ).

 During the hearing, the court referred to the state government's decision last week to promote four more IPS officers to DGP rank and asked what provisions of law allow such appointments.
 
 Chennithala's counsel pointed out that even though an IPS officer in the rank of DGP is to be appointed as VACB director, the government has not made an appointment yet. The state police chief is presently holding the additional charge of VACB director.
 
 Opposing this, state government's counsel submitted that the appointment of the four DGPs are as per cadre rules and the remaining eight IPS officers were elevated to DGP rank as per provisions of Kerala Police Act. 
 
 The promotions were made on the basis of their qualifications and experience. Similar appointments were also made during UDF's term too. Those elevated to DGP rank as per Kerala Police Act provisions are not eligible for the salary of a cadre-rank DGP, government counsel informed.
 
 The court has postponed the petition for further hearing.
