Competition for   and   admissions is set to get tougher this year as experts predict a rise in overall qualifying scores or the minimum cut-off score.

 With many CBSE students finding the test easy, as many of the test questions were from   books, it is going to be difficult for their state board counterparts when it comes to the 15% all India quota seats.
 
 
 Every year, CBSE, along with results, also releases cutoff scores in the form of percentile for different categories. For example, in 2017, 50th percentile was declared to be the qualifying percentile for the unreserved category. The corresponding cut-off score for the 50th percentile was 131. Only those who had scored 131 or above were declared eligible, and an all India rank was given to those candidates.
 
 “After analysing available data, we noted that there has been an increase in overall enrolment and many found the paper easy,” said  , educational consultant.
 
 “We estimate the cut-off for unreserved category to increase from 131 to 135-140 this year,” said educational consultant  . “The qualifying score for securing an admission under the all-India quota might also increase from 585 to 610. Students from Tamil Nadu may find it difficult to get MBBS/BDS seats under this quota and CBSE students would continue to dominate this counselling,” he added.
 
 D Devaraj, a physics teacher from a private coaching centre in Chennai, said, “For admissions to TN colleges, cut-offs for the open category is expected to increase as students were better prepared this time. Many had joined coaching classes much earlier.”
