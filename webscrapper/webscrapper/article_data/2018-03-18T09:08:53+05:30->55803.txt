TRICHY: The occurrence of cancer among people below 30 years of age in India is significantly higher in comparison to the western countries, chairperson of   (WIA) Dr  , said.

 Speaking at the International Women’s Day Celebrations event in Trichy held on Saturday, Shanta focused on the most common forms of cancer that are affecting people in India and the importance of cancer detection at an early stage.
 
 Shanta emphasised the importance of mammogram for diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage. She said that though the arbitrary age for women to undergo mammogram test was 40, the rule doesn’t apply for some women. “It’s very important to look at the family history. If a woman’s family members had cancer, then it is important for her to take the mammogram test as early as possible,” she said. 
 
 “The interpretation of mammography should always be done along with a clinician for accurate diagnosis and detection,” she added.
 
 Tha   awardee also spoke about how the occurrence of cancer among youngsters increased. “Compared to western countries, if you take a look at the occurrence of cancer among people who are below 30 in India, it is significantly higher,” Shanta said. 
 
 Shanta listed cervical, breast and oral cancers as the most common forms of cancers in India and reiterated that early detection would enable efficient treatment and curing.
 
 Director of Dr  ,   Govindaraj, spoke about what kind of breast cancer awareness campaigns would be more effective in rural areas. “We have conducted several campaigns in villages and found that when the effect of breast cancer is shown through pictures, it creates huge impact among the women there,” Hemamalini said.
 
 During the event, awards for women achievers in various fields were also given.
