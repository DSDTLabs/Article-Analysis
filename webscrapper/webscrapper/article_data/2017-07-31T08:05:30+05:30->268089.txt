KOLAR: Truckloads of tomatoes dumped on the   highway, that's the scene farmers in Kolar are used to, reeling under losses due to low prices in the market and lack of a minimum support price. This year, though, tomatoes are selling at a premium due to a fall in supply, making farmers rich. 

 Venkatappa B, 55, of   in Kolar, returned to his field after selling the day's tomato yield in the market. He told TOI, "It's a rare occasion for us when the tomato yield shows indications of good returns. Though we hear that tomatoes are being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg, we get only around Rs 50. But the price is a lot better, considering we used to sell tomatoes at Rs 2 per kg when there was no demand."
 
 Pradeep Kumar from   taluk said a tomato farmer invests a minimum of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per acre of production and the crop matures in four months. "If there is no proper price in the market, we don't get even the labour charges to pluck tomatoes. This is the reason farmers throw them on the road," he said. Though farmers are benefiting from the prices this time around, they are worried because the yield per acre has come down. "We thought we could reap the benefits of good tomato prices but there is a problem. I have 8 acres for tomatoes and used to take 1,000 boxes (each of 15 kg) every day to the market. But this time, I could take only 200 boxes. We don't get proper groundwater even after drilling up to 1,200 feet. Lack of water, increased temperatures and diseases have resulted in low production," said  , another farmer.
