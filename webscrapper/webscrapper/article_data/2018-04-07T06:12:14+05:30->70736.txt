CHENNAI: A man had followed a woman at   in   on Friday and snatched her  , dragging her along in the process as he boarded his accomplice’s two-wheeler. The miscreants escaped on their vehicle leaving the woman injured.

 The victim sustained injuries on her neck and knees and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital.
 
 The victim was identified as Devi, 42, a sanitary worker at a private company. She was on her way to her workplace at 6am when the incident took place. The two miscreants targetted Devi as she was walking alone on a deserted road.
 
 The pillion rider got off from the vehicle and followed Devi from behind by foot. He was unable to take the chain away, as the woman held on to it tightly. She even cried out for help but there was no one around to come to her aid. The snatcher pulled her along with the chain as the rider started off his bike. In the impact, the chain broke.
 
 Pushing the woman down, the miscreants fled the scene. A biker, on hearing the woman’s screams, rushed her to a nearby hospital.
 
 Based on her complaint, the Teynampet police registered a case. The victim told the police that the rider was wearing helmet and that she failed to notice the vehicle number. Police have obtained footage from CCTV cameras to aid their investigation.
 
 “We suspect it to be handiwork of a habitual offender. They targeted the woman since it was early in the morning and there was very less movement of vehicles,” said an investigating officer.
