LUCKNOW: France’s famous   fountains would be on display on Gomti’s banks. These giant   would be installed inside a lake on Gomti’s right bank near  . 

 The government proposed installation of musical fountains when a small lake was formed near the rubber dam while constructing diaphragm walls along the sides of the river. Irrigation department said since fountains can be installed only in clean water, the idea of musical fountains was mooted. “The fountain will be about 150-metre-high and would display colours, lights and music along the 300-metre-long lake,” said irrigation department executive engineer Surendra Kumar.
 
 To keep the water clean, the department would also build a filter dam near the lake to cleanse the water regularly. Irrigation department said the first consignment of fountain has arrived from France while the second delivery is expected by January 26. Engineers from France are also flying in to assemble it.
 
 An amphitheater is also being built near this lake with another fountain it its centre. Both fountains cost about Rs 60 crore. Officials said the fountains would create a water wall which would act as a projector to display short films on Lucknow’s cultural heritage, monuments and other tourist spots. “The lake would display images from two projectors while there would be one movie projector for the amphitheater,” said Kumar. 
 
 Mumbai-based entertainment company Cineyug has been roped in for display of short films. Officials said the fountain show would be free. People would be allowed to stand by or sit inside the amphitheater to enjoy the show. For initial few months, the French company installing this fountain would take care of its operation and maintenance. Later, the contract would be given to some other company.
