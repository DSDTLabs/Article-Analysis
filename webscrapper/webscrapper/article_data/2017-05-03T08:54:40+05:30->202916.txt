JAIPUR: Almost 50% private schools in   and   have not received a single application for admission under   quota.

 Data provided by the RTE cell says that out of the 2,055 schools in Alwar, 1,036 didn’t get a single application. Similarly, 615 schools out of total 1,423 in Sikar didn’t receive any application for admission under RTE quota.
 
 However, the department is happy as it has received a total of 5.73 lakh applications in 24,500 schools for RTE quota admissions.
 
 This was revealed during the lottery of RTE quota admissions in the state.
 
 According to the data, 8,655 schools in the state have not received a single application for admission under RTE quota.
 
 Jaipur’s 432 schools, including some elite ones on  , are on the list.
 
 The department has said that these schools will not be given second chance for filling RTE seats. The RTE Act says that 25% of the seats in private schools are to be reserved for economically poor and disadvantaged groups.
 
 Officials of the RTE cell say that these are low quality schools which were not preferred by the parents or must be located in the sparsely populated areas. “The trend also indicates that most of the parents have preferred government schools over sub-standard private schools,” said   of RTE cell.
 
 The department has ruled out any possibility of technical error. The officials said they will look into the matter in districts where one third of the schools didn’t receive a single application form. The RTE Act also defines that onus for the admission rests on schools which have to publicise and popularise the RTE admissions.
