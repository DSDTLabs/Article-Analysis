Rajkot: As many as 17 demoiselle cranes have died in Mansar lake of Sayla in Surendranagar district over the last three days. While the locals said birds died as their trachea got chocked after they consumed some grains, the forest department claimed that the birds died after consuming poisonous water. The bird carcasses were sent for postmortem.

 The migrating birds from Siberia and other cold countries visit Mansar lake in big numbers every year. Forest department officers reached the lake as soon as they got information. Two birds were give immediate medical treatment, but they could not be saved.
 
 Deputy conservator of forests, Surendranagar, P Purshothama said, “The exact cause of death will be known only after postmortem report, but primarily we believe that the birds died because of food poisoning. They may have consumed some water mixed with pesticides used by farmers.”
