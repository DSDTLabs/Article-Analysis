CHANDIGARH: Delay in release of payment by the Chandigarh municipal corporation ( ) has become an issue of concern for the   (RWAs) as they fail to pay the salary of the staff and have also not been able to purchase required equipment for maintenance work of the parks.

 Member of RWA, Sector 32, Gurdev  , said, “The MC has released the payment of only one month and is yet to pay that of three months.”
 He said the MC has been releasing a very minimal amount which is creating obstructions in maintenance of the parks and paying the salary to the staff.
 
 As per the norms, Rs 12,900 is allocated to each RWA every month for the maintenance of parks out of which Rs 10,000 is paid to the staff and rest is used for the purchase of the seeds, equipment and other required material. But as the funds are yet to be released to the RWA’s, they are facing economic crunch and are being forced to uphold the salaries of the staff for the time being. The issue was discussed in the recent Federation of Sectors’ Welfare Association of Chandigarh ( ) meeting so that the authorities speed up the release of the amount.
 
 FOSWAC chairman   said the MC has been requested to release the payment to the association so that the association can maintain the parks properly.
