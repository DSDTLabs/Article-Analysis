BHUBANESWAR:   is staring at the prospect of   losing the leader of opposition (LoP) status in the Odisha assembly after the party’s strength went down to 14 following the disqualification of Sundargarh MLA   by the Orissa high court on Tuesday.

 “The state government, however, may not revoke the official status accorded to Narasingha keeping in mind the importance of the position in the democratic set-up,” an official source said.
 
 Though the speaker’s office is yet to take a call on the issue, Narasingha said legally he cannot claim the status as the Congress’s strength has come down to less than 10% in the assembly.
 
 For the LoP position, a party needs one-tenth of the total seats in the assembly. In the 147-member house, Congress needs at least 15 legislators. It had won 16 seats in the 2014 election but the numbers fell to 15 after the death of Bijepur MLA Subal Sahu last August and with Jogesh’s disqualification, it now has 14 legislators. “As our number has been reduced to 14 after the high court order, we cannot claim the position as per law,” Narasingha said.
 
 The high court on Tuesday annulled the election of the Sundargarh MLA for using a fake scheduled caste certificate while filing his nomination papers. The seat was reserved for scheduled tribe (ST) candidates. Denying the charges, Jogesh Singh, a two-time MLA, said he would move   against the decision.
