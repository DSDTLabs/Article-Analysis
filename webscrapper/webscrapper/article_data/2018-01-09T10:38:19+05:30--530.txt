CHENNAI: The Arumughaswamy commission, which is probing former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, is willing to pass on information that the former chief minister’s aide V K   sought to allow her to file an affidavit, officials said on Monday.

 Through her lawyer Raja Senthur  , Sasikala had told the commission that she would file an affidavit only after she is given evidence provided by witnesses who have deposed before the one-man panel.
 
 After she was served summons on December 21, Pandian said “some of the witnesses the commission examined [had furnished] evidence” that “prejudicially affected” his client . 
 
 Sasikala was asked to file an affidavit within 15 days of receiving the summons.
 
 “We are ready to provide the evidence,” an official assisting the commission told reporters on Monday. “But for that they have to come to the commission. We also intend to ask some questions.”
 
 Pandian, who filed the counter with the commission, said no evidence had been furnished with the summons. “At this juncture, Sasikala denies such evidence of witnesses given in her absence,” stated the counter,filed last week.
 
  The commission hasbeen requested to furnish details of witnesses in a tabular column containing the names of witnesses, date of evidence and nature of documents filed, if any, by the witnesses.
 
 On Monday, Jayalalithaa’s family doctor Sivakumar appeared before the commission. He went in around 10am and his deposition lasted close to three hours. 
 
 “I was asked details about Jayalalithaa’s medical records. I have been summoned again on January 22,after which I shall give you all the details regarding the inquiry,” he told reporters, declining to go into the details.
