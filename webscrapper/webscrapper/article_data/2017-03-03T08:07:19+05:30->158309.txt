NEW DELHI: The ‘Save DU’ march by ABVP tried to make a bizarre connect with “communist violence” in Kerala. Disturbing imagery of the violence sprang up all around the campus, which troubled even policemen guarding the protest route. 

 Witnesses said the posters were put up in and around the campus and Vishwavidyalaya Metro station from 10am onwards as the ABVP protesters started gathering. The posters showed RSS and BJP men in Kerala who were victims of murderous attacks. Many police officers pleaded with the organisers not to put those posters up due to their disturbing content. But ABVP called it necessary and said it was a “reality that students need to see”. 
 
 Addressing the crowd, national joint organising secretary of ABVP, Shriniwas, said, “Police say that these pictures are disturbing and will affect students. But what about what we face in Kerala every day?”
 
 Students were very uncomfortable too. Many said they had never seen anything as scary as that. Many complained too. But  , ABVP’s national convener, said the photos were authentic, and those who call ABVP violent should see what the communists have done in Kerala. 
 
 AISA, however, objected strongly to the posters. Calling the hoardings fake, it said these were also put up illegally at spots where hoardings aren’t allowed. Later, Maurice Nagar police station confirmed accepting a complaint about the posters.
