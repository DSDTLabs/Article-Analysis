Hannah Reji, who made her acting debut in the film Darvinte Parinamam as a bold rustic woman, will now be seen in Ranjan Pramod's upcoming movie Rakshadhikari Baiju. 

 The actress will play the role of Biju Menon's wife in the comedy entertainer.
  Hannah who is upbeat about being part of the film, says, 'I play a housewife named Ajitha, and it is totally a naadan kathapathram. The film is the tell-tale of people from a village at large, dealt with a tinge of comedy. It is more about how development affects the villagers, and how they perceive it.'
 
  Given that Hannah is a bubbly person in real life, she says that it was in fact challenging to essay the homely character on-screen. She adds, 'Ajitha has everything that a normal homemaker has, and in order to do justice to the role, I had to do some homework. I was asked to watch a few movies for reference, and the team lent me all the help so that I could imbibe the character more easily.'
