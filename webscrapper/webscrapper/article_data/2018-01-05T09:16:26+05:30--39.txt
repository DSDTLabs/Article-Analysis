LUCKNOW:   and former UP chief minister   is peeved over the   across the country and would soon share his concern with the Centre.

 In the city to celebrate his 86th birthday, Kalyan—surrounded by a large number of senior leaders and party workers at his Mall Avenue residence—said that agriculturists, agriculture universities and other experts in the governments should work in tandem to draw a policy so that farmers are not exploited by middlemen or traders, and get handsome returns for their produce.
 
 “We know per acre productivity has gone up. But has the income of farmers increased? No,” Kalyan said, adding that during his visits to agriculture universities in Rajasthan, he has appealed that scientists undertake crop awareness programmes among farmers so that they don’t face glut in the harvesting season.
 
 “It pains to see tomatoes being thrown on roads, potatoes dumped in cold storages and sugar cane burnt in fields as farmers are not getting remunerative prices for their produce,” he said.
 
 Another issue he is going to take up is the low standard of the political discourse in the country.
 
 “I would not name any leader or party but the way some leaders have uttered some below-the-belt remarks is not good for democracy,” he said.
