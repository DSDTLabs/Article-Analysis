FAZILKA: Victim and the most important witness in the brutal, December 11, 2015, killing of Dalit youth Bhim Tank, Gurjant Singh alias Janta, has also changed his statement in the court about the place where the two were attacked.

 With this, Janta has become the third key witness in the case to have retracted from the statement he gave to the police immediately after the murder. According to the police complaint, Janta had accompanied Bhim to the farmhouse of the main accused, influential liquor baron Shiv Lal, when the youth’s arms and legs were chopped off. Janta, an associate of Bhim, had survived the attack, but lost an arm and a leg in the assault that was allegedly carried out by the henchmen of Shiv Lal and his nephew Amit Doda.
 
 Appearing before the court of Fazilka additional sessions Lachhman Singh on Monday, Janta said the crime was not committed in Doda’s farmhouse, but in a neighbouring building. Earlier, Gurjant’s cousin Ranjit Rana and uncle Bhola had turned hostile in the case on February 8 and in January, respectively. Instead of their earlier claims that the attack was carried out in Doda’s farmhouse, they told the court that the assaults took place at a building next to the farmhouse.
 
 In his statement in the court, Gurjant said he was injured and under panic when he gave his statement through video conferencing from a hospital in Amritsar. “I was pressured by an inspector-rank police official, who told me to give a statement as per his directions,” he said, adding that his statement on Monday was factual.
 
 During his three-month treatment at a hospital in Amritsar, Gurjant had alleged that Bhim and he were attacked at Shiv Lal’s farmhouse in Ramsara village in Abohar and by the liquor baron’s “henchmen”.
 
 Police had registered a case on the statement of Rana, who told the police that he shifted Bhim and Gurjant from the farmhouse to Abohar civil hospital.
