SURAT: The history of cadaver organ transplant in India stretches to around two decades and awareness about it is slow to develop. Only a few states mostly in   seem to have adopted it wholeheartedly ever since The Transplantation of Human Organs Act was passed in 1994. 

 
 Cadaver organ donation rate is 36 per cent in Spain and 26 per cent in the USA. However, it is just 0.05 per cent in India. Against this background, cadaver organ donation in the Diamond City has been good and only growing with time. In 2017 in Gujarat, out of 106 cadaver kidneys transplanted, 52 were of people who belonged to Surat. Similarly, out of 62 cadaver livers transplanted in   during the year, 28 were of residents who belonged to Surat. Out of 10 cadaver hearts transplanted in people in Gujarat and other states in 2017, nine were that of those who died in Surat. 
 
 President   during his visit to the city on May 29 will felicitate at least 32 cadaver organ donors’ family members, doctors, hospitals and others working to create awareness about cadaver organ donation.
 
 “We felicitate family members of organ donors every year. It is a noble act which we want more and more people to do. Surat has been topping the chart of donors in the state for the last many years, but the number is not what we want. We don’t have transplant facility in hospitals of Surat. Lack of facility has been depriving us from accepting some cadaver organs,” Donate Life founder   said. His NGO works in the field of organ donation.
