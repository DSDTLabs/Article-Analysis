PUNE: Two cars parked at the   area in Chinchwad were set ablaze early on Wednesday.

 Chinchwad police said one of the owners of the vehicles —   of Chinchwad — had lodged a complaint against three unidentified persons for allegedly torching the vehicles parked on the road.
 
 Police have obtained footage from   cameras showing three youths riding to the spot on a motorcycle around 12.13am. One of them held a plastic bottle containing some liquid. The suspect decanted the liquid on one of the cars and then turned to the other car. Then the cars were set on fire by another suspect. One of the cars was completed damaged in the fire, while the other was partially damaged.
 
 Chowdhary, a software engineer, said he did not know any of the suspects nor did he have any animosity with anyone in the area. “I think the suspects indulged in some mischief for fun but it is a loss for me,” he said.
 
 Such cases of arson were being reported for the past few days. Four trucks were set ablaze at Khadakwasla on March 15, while seven vehicles, including two four-wheelers, were torched at   on Tuesday.
 
 At Lullanagar in Wanowrie, four two-wheelers caught fire on Tuesday night because of a short-circuit in the parking area of the residential building.
