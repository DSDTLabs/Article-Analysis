CHANDIGARH: The Haryana lokayukta has directed Gurugram police commissioner and arms licencing authority of the district to probe into the procedural lapses into the issuance of an arms licence to actor  . 

 Lokayukta Justice N K Aggarwal (retired) has fixed July 24 as the next date of hearing while directing CP, Gurugram and ALA, Gurugram to submit the report in the matter. The order is consequent to the recommendation by registrar Manjit Singh on the complaint by Naresh Kumar Kadian, an animal activist and commissioner of Haryana Scouts and Guides. 
 
 
  
 
 In March last year, Kadian had sought intervention of the lokayukta for action against officials involved in issuance of the arms licence to Soha Ali Khan in November 1996 alleging she was a minor at that time. A weapon registered against her name was later found to be used in the black buck killing case. The lokayukta had referred the matter to registrar for preliminary investigations. 
 
 In his report submitted to lokayukta on March 10 this year, the registrar has pointed to lapses in the matter. “It is proved that Soha Ali Khan @Soha Sultan obtained the arms licence by concealing the material fact of her age from the competent authority,” the report by the registrar read. The registrar observed that that prima facie Soha committed an offence punishable under section 420 of IPC.
