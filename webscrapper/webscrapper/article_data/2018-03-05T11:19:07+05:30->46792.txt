"Friends" alums   and   say they along with former co-star   maintain a group text chain.

 Cox, who played the control freak   on the popular sitcom, said she feels stressed by the back and forth messaging.
 
 "Lisa, Jennifer and I all have a text chain, but to me it's too much pressure. I'm not into the group text chain. I really don't like it!" 
 
 "And then you have something funny to say and you say it but then you send the text and they don't get it," Cox added.
 
 Besides Cox, Kudrow's   and Aniston's   time on "Friends" ended in 2004 after 10 seasons.
