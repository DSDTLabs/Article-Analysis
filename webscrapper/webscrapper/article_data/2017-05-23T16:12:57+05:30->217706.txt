 Rihanna and actress Lupita Nyong'o are set to costar in a buddy movie to be directed by Ava DuVernay. 
Issa Rae is writing the screenplay.
 
  
  
 The project began as an online meme when a photo that was taken in 2014 of the two women in the front row of a fashion show - went viral, prompting calls to turn it into a movie. 
 
 Twitter users went so far as to ask for DuVernay to direct, with Rae to write. Soon after, all four women pledged their support to the project on the social media platform. 
 
 Sources said Rae is already working on the script and the studio is eyeing a production start of 2018 after DuVernay completes her current film.
