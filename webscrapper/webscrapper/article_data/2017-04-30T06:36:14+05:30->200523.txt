NEW DELHI: A notice asking students to come to the   in "proper dress" at  's Department of Social Work (DSW) on Saturday raised issue of moral policing in colleges. 

 Head of DSW and provost of the hostel, professor Neera Agnimitra said the notice was meant for boys. DSW, Agnimitra said, was the only department that has a common hostel and common room for both men and women, which is used for reading newspapers, studying and watching television.
 
 A few girls complained to the warden about some boys who started to sleep in the common room after air conditioner was set up there. This, the girls said, made them uncomfortable, Agnimitra said. "The notice was only to notify that boys should come to the common room in appropriate night dresses." 
 
  This order comes a week after a girls hostel at IIT Delhi had asked students to dress in "fully covered decent western or Indian dresses" for their House Day.
