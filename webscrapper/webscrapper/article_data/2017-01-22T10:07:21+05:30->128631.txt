PUNE: Social crusader   has demanded the use of ‘totaliser’ machines to maintain secrecy in the voting process ahead of the forthcoming civic elections in   in other states.

 In a letter sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 20, Hazare said the current practice of counting votes makes it easy for the candidate to identify the areas like villages or even lanes that did not vote for him or her. 
 
 In the current system, votes from each electronic voting machine (EVM) are counted separately, revealing the voting trend in each polling station. When a candidate finds out that a particular area did not vote for him/her, he/she can act vindictive and obstruct development of that area.
 
 Totaliser machine mixes votes from various booths for counting. These machines prevent disclosure of voting patterns across polling stations, allaying the fears of voters against any pre-poll intimidation or post-poll victimization by any candidate.
 
 Prior to the introduction of EVMs, ballot papers from various polling stations would be mixed as specified under Rule 59 (A) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.
 
 Hazare said in the letter that he had raised the matter with the chief election commissioner first in March 2009 and again in April and July of the same year. “In September 2009, I received a reply from the Election Commission (EC) of India saying that a letter had been sent to the government regarding the use of  ,” Hazare said.
 
 The Gandhian said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister on September 22, 2016 to raise the matter again. But as he did not receive a reply, he decided to send another letter to discuss the matter.
