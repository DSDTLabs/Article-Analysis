NEW DELHI: On Wednesday morning, the benchmark equity indices once again were trading flat but in the green as   inched towards the psychological mark of 34,000. This is however, not the first time the BSE index has touched the 34K- mark, as it was trading in the tune of as much as 36,400, earlier this year.

 
 The broader index NSE   was testing the 10,400-mark.
 
 The market breadth in early trading, was not in a great shape as apart from Nifty IT, all major sectoral sub-indices were in the red. The IT sub-index was up more than 2 per cent while the metal index was bleeding the most, down a per cent.
 
 Major   like Wipro, TCS and   were leading the pack among scrips as they expect a good showing in last quarter of FY18. Dr Reddy, Coal India, Sun Pharma and Adani ports were losing the most.
