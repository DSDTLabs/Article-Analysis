NEW DELHI: A judge who does not record court proceedings “honestly and fairly“ does the greatest injustice to litigants, the high court has observed while transferring a corruption case from one trial court to another.

 The high court, which appreciated the efforts of the special judge to expedite the trial in the case, said it does not mean that while doing so the lower court can act in a “brazen and uncompassionate manner“.
 
 “A judge who does not   record the proceedings, does the greatest injustice to parties. A judge is supposed to have no personal interest in a case being tried or dealt with by him. He is always expected to truthfully record the proceedings conducted by him,“ Justice   said.
 
 “It is for this reason that the proceedings recorded by a judge in his orders are accepted as true. If a judge breaches this trust reposed in him, it reflects on his credibility and on his independence and impartiality,“ the high court said.
 
 The court passed the order while transferring a 16year old graft case from the court of a special   judge here to another trial court.
