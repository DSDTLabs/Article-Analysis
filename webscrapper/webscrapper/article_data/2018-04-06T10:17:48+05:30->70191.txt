BHOPAL: In a fresh move to give respite to investors, if a promoter leaves a project incomplete and escapes after collecting the money, the   ( ) would facilitate completion of such projects by constituting a committee of buyers in the same project and getting the work completed through the buyers.

 The move will ensure that the buyers get their properties even if a builder escapes with investorsâ€™ money. The committee of buyers will decide the future course of a project and the facilities they want to keep or leave depending upon the financial viability.
 
 The need for such a move was felt by RERA after coming across the complaint of a project in Indore, where a builder escaped leaving behind an unfinished project.
 
 RERA chairman Anthony deSa said investors of an Indore-based project approached wherein the developer escaped after collecting the money. The promoter is untraceable for past around two years now.
 
 More than 50 per cent of the work is completed in the towers of the project. RERA is considering to constitute tower wise committee of the investors so that they could complete the remaining work and get the properties. The committee can collect the balance amount from the investors that they were supposed to pay to developer and complete the work of the towers at their level. RERA would ensure that things remain fair.
 
 But the option would be considered only when majority of investors want RERA to intervene and form the committee, the chairman said, adding that RERA would not force the investors to go for this option. If the idea remains successful in Indore, it can be implemented in other parts of the state as well, but so far only one such project has been brought into the notice of RERA, the officials added.
