TRICHY: They say future wars will be waged over water. A nasty brawl between two men near a street tap at Periya Milaguparai on Tuesday that cost one of them his ear could perhaps be seen as an ominous precursor to such a scenario.

 Amid the mad scramble for water in TN, where the situation has turned precarious even before peak summer, Mahendran, 50, wall painter, and his neighbour and relative Rengaraj, 55, got into a tiff over drawing water from the tap near the Trichy collectorate.As per norm, each person can fill one vessel, but when Ma hendran filled two vessels, Rengaraj objected. The verbal duel between the two soon turned into fisticuffs and, in a fit of rage, Rengaraj bit off Mahendran's ear and spat it out. A round 50 people had queued up at the tap. It was a general rule that each person can fill only one vessel. When Mahendran filled water in two vessels, Rengaraj objected and this sparked a quarrel.
 
 Things turned ugly when they began tearing at each other. Onlookers, wary of intervening, were stunned by the bloody turn of events when Rengaraj bit off Mahendran's ear. They got him admitted to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH).Claiming he too was injured, Rengaraj himself got admitted to the hospital. The sessions court police soon arrived, made inquiries and searched for the bitten piece of ear but could not find it. “The ear has not been found,“ confirmed inspector Balraj of the Cantonment police station. Based on a complaint from Mahendran, the police registered a case and arrested Rengaraj. He has been remanded in judicial custody.
