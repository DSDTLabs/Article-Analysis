GURUGRAM:   on Wednesday lodged police complaints against four people for dumping waste and   garbage in the open. Two people were caught dumping construction waste near the Ardee City gate while two others were caught burning garbage in the   in Nathupur.

 According to corporation officials, both dumping of construction waste and burning garbage in the open violates the NGT norms. 
 
 An MCG team on inspection caught the offenders red-handed on Wednesday and issued challans to them. 
 
 The two men who were caught dumping construction waste were issued challans of Rs 10,000 each. The two others caught burning garbage in the open were fined Rs 5,000 each.
 
 “Our team has lodged two separate police complaints and FIRs will be registered in both cases,” said an MCG official. 
 
 He added that going forward, all such cases would be met with stringent action, including issuing of challans and lodging of police complaints.
 
 The corporation has received 29 complaints of burning of waste in the open from across the city in the past 90 days. 
 
 While 21 of these complaints were received in January, MCG lodged six complaints in February and two in March. 
 
 In contrast, MCG had received 92 such complaints last year. Most cases have been reported from Zone 1 and Zone 2 areas, which include Atul Kataria Chowk, Civil Lines, sectors 7, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22 and 23, Palam Vihar, and many new sectors (sectors 100, 110A, and 110). 
 
 On the other hand, only 18 such cases had been reported in the first three months of last year.
 
 Following a spurt in such cases, the corporation formed a 100-member team to check burning and dumping of garbage in the open earlier last month. 
 
 A team of 25 MCG officials will inspect each zone of the city to curb the rise in such incidents. Gurugram has four such zones.
