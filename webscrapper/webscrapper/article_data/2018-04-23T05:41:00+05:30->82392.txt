NAVI MUMBAI: The  , which encompasses five districts including Thane, has rolled out a housing project intended to benefit for its 8,000 constabulary.

 The houses will cost around 30% below the market price. Around 650 houses will be built in the first phase of the project, which is pegged to be completely transparent.
 
 A mere 32% of cops get government accommodation while in service, and the rest struggle for decent accommodation. A mass housing project near  , meant for 7,200 constables, was delayed for a long time.
 
 District level housing committees, under the supervision of superintendents of police (SP), have been formed in districts of Thane Rural, Palghar, Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri. The committees negotiate with all stakeholders—builders, land owners, construction material suppliers— and ensure all components are sourced at discounted prices or no-loss-no-profit prices. Stamp duty exemption or reduced stamp duty and increased   for these projects will be pursued with the government.
 
 Special IGP-Konkan Range  , said, “The constabulary ends up not having a house after retirement. Therefore, this project was planned to ensure that they have houses of their own at reduced prices. The project has been made transparent at all levels.”
 
 The project was initiated last year. All of the projects in the first phase have been given various deadlines, but all are expected to be completed in the next two years. DA Gedam, Sindhudurg SP, said, “Cops do not need to make any payment till the possession of the house. An independent agency will also monitor the quality of construction.”
 
 A police officer said, “In an attempt to ensure that cops buy the flat at the lowest possible cost. All options, including scouting for land wherever available at cheaper prices to tying up with builders have been explored. Wherever builders have agreed to be part of the project on our terms, we have sourced construction material from manufacturers to reduce cost.”
