NEW DELHI: Individuals who violate regulations at airports will now face higher penalties, with state-owned   putting in place revised fine amount.

 Any person contravening the AAI regulations will face up to Rs 5,000 penalty, a steep hike from the earlier Rs 500, as per the new regulations. 
 
 Any continuing offence will attract an additional fine that may extend to Rs 500 daily during which such violation continues after “the conviction for the first such contravention”. Under the earlier rules, this amount was just Rs 20 per day.
 
 AAI chairman   said that penalties have been increased as the earlier quantum was not appropriate with the changing times. 
 
 Asked whether the revision has been effected due to any recent incident involving unruly passengers, he said: “This (amendment) has nothing to do with (any) recent incident. This has been under consideration for some time,” he said.
