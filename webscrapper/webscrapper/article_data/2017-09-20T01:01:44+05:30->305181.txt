MUMBAI: The Centre’s move to allow   to share excess units seems to have worked in addressing problem of blood   in public hospitals. As per State   Transfusion Council (SBTC) data, merely 2% of 61,000-odd units collected by major   and blood   between January and June this year could not be utilised within their shelf life. 

 Sixteen hospitals, including KEM, Sion, BYL Nair, JJ, Cama, St George, Cooper, INHS Ashvini and Tata Memorial, failed to use about 1,092 bags of blood before their expiry date. SBTC said the expiry units are within the acceptable range, as major hospitals are expected to stock ready units keeping emergencies and mass disasters in mind. The term “expiry” is used when healthy blood packets fail to get utilised within a time-frame unlike “discarded”, which refers to blood that is unfit for transfusion. 
 
 If SBTC data is accurate, KEM in Parel, Cama and Albless at CST and Tata Memorial Hospital almost had negligible units wasted. KEM, for instance, claimed not a single unit was discarded, while Cama and Tata stated that only one and five units had to be thrown away in six months. The biggest blood bank of the city, JJ Mahanagar, which collected a little less than 13,000 units had to discard about 2%. Among hospitals, Sion had the most expired units. 
 
 “The whole blood has a shelf life of 35 days. Wastage doesn’t seem to be that big a problem now. Also, public hospitals have a mandate to keep 5-10% in ready stock for disasters,” said Arun Thorat, assistant director, SBTC. He added that utilisation of a single unit of blood can easily be enhanced by breaking it into components such as platelets and red blood cells. “Only 279 out of 327 blood banks in Maharashtra have this facility. We are encouraging all to start a fractionalisation facility,” he added.
