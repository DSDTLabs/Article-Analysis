MUMBAI: In the first case of an aggregator cab service driver falling victim to road rage in Mumbai, a 38-year-old man was beaten to death by three youths on a bike in Govandi after a petty argument over speeding ahead.

 Salim Shaikh was dragged out of his cab by the three youths on Ahilyabai Holkar Marg at   at 7pm on Monday, thrashed and kicked. The youths then banged his head on the ground and escaped. Unconscious, he was taken to   by passersby but died within a few hours of admission, said Sahaji Umap, deputy commissioner of police (zone 6).
 
 Two of the accused—Imran Shaikh (19) and Abdul Wahab (21)—were arrested on Tuesday and booked for murder. 
  
  
 Shivaji Nagar police are on the lookout for the third accused, Wajid Ali.
 
 All three are residents of Govandi. So was the Ola cab driver, who lived with his wife and two children in plot no 26 in Shivaji Nagar. The arrests were made after cops started looking for the assailants from the image of the bike captured on CCTVs in the area. 
 
 Police said Salim Shaikh was driving his cab in the locality on Monday evening after having dropped a passenger when the three youths riding on one bike in violation of rules overtook the taxi at high speed. “Eyewitnesses said the driver shouted at the youths for overtaking in a rash manner. The trio stopped, got into an argument with Shaikh and abused him. They then pulled Shaikh out of the cab and started beating and kicking him,” said Deepak Pagare, senior inspector, Shivaji Nagar. They escaped after he lay on the road with head injuries.
 
 “We got blurred CCTV camera images of the bike but realized it was from the same area. With few clues, our teams fanned out and succeeded in nabbing two of the accused,” Pagare added.
