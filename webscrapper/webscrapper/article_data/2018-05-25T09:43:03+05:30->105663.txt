TUTICORIN: He told us that he was going to the office. We have no idea how he ended up near the collectorate," said Baskar, the grieving father of young   Ranjith Kumar who died in police firing on Tuesday.

 Baskar said his son had never taken part in any of the anti-Sterlite protests.
 
 Twenty-two-year-old Ranjith was one of the 10 protesters killed when the police opened fire that day. An engineering graduate and a doting son who helped his father, a building contractor, with the business, Ranjith was every bit an adored son with dreams of fighting his way into international boxing rings after having won several tournaments back home.
 
 A talented boxer with a drive to carve his niche, his coach I Stephen said, "Ranjith dreamt of becoming an international star. He had motivated many youngsters from his circles to take up sports seriously."
 
 Pushed into a state of numbness by the sudden tragedy that struck them, Ranjith’s family recalled of how very socially conscious he was, always ready to help those in need. He was known in the neighbourhood for donating blood and organising blood donation camps. 
 
 The   had decided to laud him for his efforts by awarding him the title of ‘Best blood organising admin’ on World Blood Donation Day on June 14. Ranjith did not live to see that day.
