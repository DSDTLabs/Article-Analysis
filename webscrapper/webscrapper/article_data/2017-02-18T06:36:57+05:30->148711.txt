SORAON (ALLAHABAD): Days after chief minister   attacked BSP chief   claiming that she might join hands with the BJP after Assembly elections, the latter hit back on Friday saying that 'nephew' (Akhilesh) had already joined hand with â€˜uncle'   much before elections during the latter's visit to Saifai to attend the wedding rituals of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's grandson.

 Addressing a public rally at Soraon for the 19 contestants of Allahabad and Pratapgarh districts, Mayawati alleged that PM Modi had given 10 months to senior BJP leaders and office bearers to get their `black money' fixed (thikane laga dein) before demonetisation.
