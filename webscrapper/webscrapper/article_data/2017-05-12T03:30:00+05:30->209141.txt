Panaji: The state-level committee constituted for the development of feni on Thursday said that both, cashew and coconut feni must be declared as heritage spirits of Goa and mooted the amendment of the Goa Excise Duty Act and Rules 1964, to incorporate this status. It arrived at a consensus that coconut feni, too, must be protected under the world intellectual property laws of geographical indication. Chaired by the excise commissioner and comprising representatives from the agriculture and tourism departments, food and drugs administration, directorate of health services and the Goa Cashew Feni Distillers and Bottlers Association, the committee agreed that the feni policy should include the standardization of production, packaging, price control, promotion, marketing and research of both the local spirits.  It also concurred that the government should pursue a geographical indication for coconut feni through the science and technology department, and formulate schemes to provide incentives to toddy tappers. Suggestions to promote dwarf coconut tree saplings and have safety workshops for toddy tappers were also considered.  Coconut toddy is distilled into coconut feni, a spirit popular in South Goa. This distillation process is believed to have existed much before that for cashew feni. Many are also of the opinion that the technique to distill coconut toddy was adapted to distil cashew juice.
