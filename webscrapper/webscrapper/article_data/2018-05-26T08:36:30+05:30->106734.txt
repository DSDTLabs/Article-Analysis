LUCKNOW:  's plan to reclaim its commercial plot in   on which   has been dumping garbage for years is going to severely hit the waste disposal management system in the city. The impact could show up in rising garbage piles across the city as LMC would have to shift massive mounds of garbage at Ghaila Ghat to its treatment plant in Shivri. 

 The exercise would put the existing garbage processing cycle on hold as LMC will first have to get rid of accumulated waste at Ghaila Ghat and only then be able to treat new waste.
 
 Ghaila Ghat was being used by LMC to dump waste until a few months ago. The garbage heaps - exceeding 8 lakh metric tonnes as per LMC's estimate - is extremely difficult and tedious to shift and treat now. 
 
 The enormity of the situation is such that LMC has asked the government to approve Rs 54 crore for setting up a treatment plant at Ghaila Ghat to treat the garbage at the spot itself. 
 
 LDA wishes to start construction of Vasantkunj Yojana from next month. Ghaila Ghat is part of the Yojana land. Officials say the garbage heaps are a big turn off for buyers and it would not be able to sell its residential units there. So it has written a letter to LMC to remove waste dumps from the spot immediately, so that it can begin reclaiming the land. 
 
 LDA executive engineer PS Mishra said, "We have written to LMC to remove the garbage heaps on priority, so that we can begin tendering from next month."
 
  LMC's environment engineer Pankaj Bhushan said, "We had sent a proposal to the government a few months ago to sanction Rs 54 crore for setting up a treatment plant there. A few private companies had also approached LMC to work on   mode and treat the waste. We need approval on either option as it is impossible to move so much of garbage."
