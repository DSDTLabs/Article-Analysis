Malda: A group of college girls thrashed a 60-year-old man for allegedly masturbating in front of them inside a park in Malda’s English Bazaar on Sunday afternoon.

 The girls had gone to the Brindabani Ground park, the only large open space in English Bazaar, when they saw a man sitting near them make indecent gestures. Their anger turned to horror when he unzipped himself.
 
 “We were shocked to see him masturbating while star-ing at us,” said one of the girls. The girls caught hold of the man and started beating the man. Their shouts drew the attention of some residents, who urged them to let him go “considering his age”. 
 
 However, the girls demanded that he be punished. To pacify them, they made him do sit-ups. The man then slipped away in the melee. 
 
 Police reached the ground on Monday to enquire about the incident after the girls posted details on social media.
