Indore: As the winter chill gripped the city, the civic body has made arrangements for setting up bonfires at various places to provide relief to the poor and homeless. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has identified over 25 locations where the bonfire would be arranged. 

 IMC officials said that bonfires will be set up at places especially where labourers and industrial workers congregate. These areas include   and   bus stand, MY Hospital, city railway station, district hospitals and IMC’s rain baseras (night shelters). “Separate bonfires will be arranged near 14 rain baseras,” said  , an official with IMC’s gardening department. 
 
 He said that they have been instructed to place bonfire when the temperature goes below 10 degree Celsius. “All 19 zonal officers of IMC have been instructed to make sure that bonfires are lit up in the proposed places regularly. Besides, they can also lit bonfires on demands of residents in their respective zone areas,” he added. 
 
 Officials said that though no separate fund is there for bonfire arrangement, mostly the firewood is arranged with stacks of wood collected from demolished encroachments.
 
 “Each zone has been provided at least one dumper bonfire firewood. Besides, hoardings, posters, stacks of furniture and anything that burns is piled up and a bonfire is prepared,” they said, adding that the waste wood is collected after encroachment drives of IMC and is stored in the corporation’s godown and is used for bonfire.
