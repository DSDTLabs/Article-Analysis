HYDERABAD: People who own open plots in the Greater Hyderabad   limits may have to cough up   (VLT) from now on. With a view to mop up revenue, the GHMC has decided to collect VLT from plot owners every year.

  The civic body is gearing up to slap notices on about 60,000 people who have open plots registered on their names in the   limits in the past two years. The deputy municipal commissioners (DMC) of all circles have been asked to send notices to the plot owners. 
 
 The civic body has also proposed to make VLT payment mandatory for registering open plots in the corporation soon. While   is based on the square feet, VLT is 0.5% of the property value at the time of registration. VLT should be paid every year till a building is constructed on it. 
 
 Though there has been such a provision in the   to impose VLT on open plots like property tax on buildings, the municipal corporation has not been collecting from the owners as the owners buy plots at one place and live in other areas
