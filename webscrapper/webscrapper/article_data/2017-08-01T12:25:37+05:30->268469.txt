PUNE:   in the catchment areas of the four dams of  ,  ,   has not only lifted   to comfortable position by the end of July, but have also pushed the storage to the highest level in the last four years.

 On Monday, the collective water stock in the four dams was recorded at 24.07 TMC (82.07%). Last year at the end of July, the dams had 57% water, while in the previous two years, the stock was around 50-60% of the total storage capacity. The irrigation department said the collective water storage has gone above the 20-TMC mark for the first time since 2014.
 
 Sources in the department on Monday said, with two more months left in the current monsoon season, they were expecting all the four dams to reach their maximum capacity soon. The weather looks conducive for more rains in the catchment areas. More spells of rain are expected which could push up water levels to 100% mark and also lead to release of more water into rivers.
 
 Water levels in the four dams, which come under the Khadakwasla irrigation circle, have gone up significantly in July. At end of June, the collective stock in these dams was at 4.18 TMC. Almost 20 TMC of water has been added in the last 30 days. The current stock can easily meet the city’s annual water requirement of 15 TMC. 
 
 On Monday, water stock in Panshet was recorded at 98%, Khadakwasla 100%,   75% and Temghar 50%. 
 
 However, there was no rainfall activity in the catchment areas. Khadakwasla recorded nil rainfall, while Panshet and Varasgaon recorded 3mm and 1mm rainfall respectively.
 
 Stock in downstream dams likely to go up
 
 An official in the irrigation department said healthy rise in water stock in the dams in the upstream areas would lead to a rise in the stock in the dams in the downstream areas. “Most dams in the hilly regions are almost full and will start discharging water in large volume if heavy rain continues,” the official added.
