Chandigarh: In the past 10 years, Chandigarh has become the only city in the country with highest vehicle density in accordance with its size and geographical area that has, over the period of time, a cumulative effect on its air quality index. This was discussed at the air quality management conference held here on Wednesday. 

 While presenting slides from an air quality assessment and monitoring report of Chandigarh at the inaugural session of the conference, scientist from the department of environment Vivek Pandey broadly highlighted five active sources of air pollution in the city. These include increasing number of transport vehicles, industrialisation, road dust re-suspension, horticulture waste and stubble burning from nearby states. 
 
 However, apart from these ambient sources of pollution, a meteoric rise in the number of transport vehicles in the city has greatly contributed towards carbon monoxide. “The per capita density of vehicles in Chandigarh has seen a surge like no other city has in the country. Chandigarh, as of now, has the density of 878 vehicles over 1,000 persons for UT, Punjab and Haryana combined,” said Pandey. 
 
 The rate of vehicular increase in the city has also been highly unusual due to steep increase in light motor vehicles (LMV) like cars and jeeps in comparison to two-wheelers. Computed data available from year 2007 to 2016 suggests that there has been an increase of 98% in LMVs as compared to the increase in two-wheelers, which has just been close to 47%. The number of registered LMVs in the city in 2007 were 1,88,968 and in 2016 this number increased to 3,75,283 in 2016, which saw an increase of 1,86,315 vehicles with an average of 1,552 cars being registered every month. 
 
 Similarly, the number of total registered two-wheelers in the city in 2007 stood at 4,70,882, while the same saw an increase to 6,95,227 in 2016, with a difference of 2,24,345 two-wheelers. The average of two wheelers being registered each month stood at 1,869. 
 
 At the same time, the total number of registered vehicles in the city were 6,69,766 in 2007, which increased to 10,96,145 till 2016 with a growth of about 64%. The increase in the number of vehicles stood at 4,26,379. 
 
 Apart from the LMVs and two-wheelers, the city has 4,500 registered buses and 11,000 goods and other vehicles. 
 
 “Chandigarh has the highest numbers of cars per person in India, which is very unusual because in other cities an increase in two-wheelers has surged. However, an increase of 98% in cars in 10 years is much higher than 47% increase in two-wheelers’ sales. As a result, ambient air quality in Chandigarh has been mainly affected by vehicular pollution that increases emission of carbon monoxide along with different compounds of nitrogen, among others,” said Pandey. 
 
 On factors responsible for increase in the number of LMVs in the city, Pandey said, “The residents of Chandigarh are economically sound and can afford to buy cars. Over the years, migration into the city has also increased and a show-off culture has also taken precedence. People here like to show-off fancy cars and do not pay a lot of attention towards public transport. The lifestyle has become like that, which is not that common in the western and southern parts of the country.”
