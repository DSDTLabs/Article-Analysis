NEW DELHI:   ( ) has been cleared to resume jet refuelling services at Kolkata airport after a week-long suspension of sales following reports of water contamination in its   (aviation turbine fuel).

 RIL's jet fuel sales were suspended after two flights belonging to a low-cost domestic carrier reported water contamination on July 6.
 
 Sources said RIL was cleared to resume sales on July 14 after investigation by pertinent authorities and has resumed service the next day .
 
 As reported by TOI on Ju ly 15, the matter came to light when two flights of the carrier, which is one of RIL's key consumers at Kolkata, returned after taking off as fuel alert signal went off. The carrier drained out the fuel and resumed service after buying fuel from state-run IndianOil Corporation.
 
 The Kolkata airport is serviced by all the three staterun oil companies -IndianOil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum -besides RIL. Aviation industry sources said RIL refuelled roughly 70 flights daily of the affected carrier daily at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport.
 
 During the period RIL sales were suspended, the carrier opted for IndianOil to refuel 40-45 flights and Hindustan Petroleum for 20-25 flights daily. This number has come down to 10-15 flights of the carrier for IndianOil, industry sources said.
 
 The sources said the contamination may have happened during transportation of the fuel from Ennore, where it was imported directly by the carrier through an independent agency and RIL was responsible for providing refuelling service.
