AHMEDABAD: A city session court on Tuesday sent   superintendent of police,  , to police remand till May 1 in connection with the bitcoin extortion case.

 The probe agency, CID (crime), sought 14-day custodial interrogation of the SP to find out various things, one of them being his handing over Rs 40 lakh to a co-accused and police inspector Anant Patel towards legal expenditure in this case.
 
 The investigator told the court that PI Anant Patel revealed that the SP had given him Rs 40 lakh on April 6 at   in Ahmedabad to bear legal expenditure for those involved in the case. The probe agency wanted to know why such a big amount was given to the PI by the SP. Jagdish Patel’s lawyer denied the charge.
 
 CID submitted that the SP role was important in this case because it is required to find out how six policemen flew to Mumbai and how three vehicles had gone to   from Amreli without his permission and without any intimation to the district control room. 
 
 CID wanted the IPS officer’s custodial interrogation to find out where the conspiracy to abduct, detain Surat-based builder Shailesh Bhatt was hatched to extort Bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore.
