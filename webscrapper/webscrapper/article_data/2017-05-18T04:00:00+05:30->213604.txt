Ahmedabad: In another embarrassment for the police department, a complaint of   was lodged against   Ashok Chaudhary, deployed with the Hawk Squad. The incident took place soon after   was announced on November 8, when a jeweller, Kaushal Soni, was going home with cash and jewellery.

 Police sources said the constable intercepted the jeweller near Vastrapur. Soni then called up his friend Munaf Pomachwala, who sorted things out by paying Chaudhary Rs 75,000.
 
 “Later Firoze alias Bobdi, the brothers Shadab and Javed Pathan, and their associates called Munaf and threatened him saying he had used Firoze’s name while settling things with the constable, who was known to Firoze. Firoze then demanded Rs 5 lakh from Munaf and threatened him with dire consequences if did not pay him,” said a police constable.
 
 Munaf approached Gaekwad Haveli police with a complaint. “During the investigation, it came to light that the constable had tipped off Firoze about the incident and told him to extort more money from the jeweller and his friend. We have booked all the accused, including the constable,” added a senior police official.
 
 Police sources said while they are hunting for the remaining accused, the constable, Ashok Chaudhary had proceeded on leave. “We are tracking him,” added a senior police official.
