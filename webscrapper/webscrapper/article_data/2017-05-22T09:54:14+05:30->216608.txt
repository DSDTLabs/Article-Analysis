KOLKATA: Howrah station, Kolkata’s iconic red-bricked edifice, is set to go green. Come August, the largest and   in the country will switch over to   to meet its daytime energy needs.

 With  , and   starting, ending or passing through the station each day,   has the highest train-handling capacity of any railway station in India, and is ranked as the busiest station in terms of passenger volume per day. Electrified in 1954, the station complex requires about 10,000 units on a daily basis, of which 60% — that translates to 6,000 units — is required during daytime.
 
 The solar plan is in accordance with the Narendra Modi government’s directive to the railways to go completely solar by 2025. Work is in progress on the rooftops and 23 platform sheds of the station to set up a 3MW solar power plant to start generating enough power. 
 
 Rays Expert, a company that has been partnering the Centre to set up solar plants on public buildings, has been chosen by the Solar Energy Corporation of India to set up two similar plants on Centre-run facilities in Bengal — Howrah Station and IIEST Shibpur. The Shibpur plant is operational. 
 
 “The plant is being set up at a cost of Rs 21 crore,” said Rahul Gupta, CEO of Rays Expert. “Eastern Railway (ER) will not have to spend anything to set up the plant. We will bear the expenses, and will sell the solar power generated at Rs 5.49 per unit, against Rs 7 that ER is paying now. This rate has been fixed for the next 25 years.” Once power generation starts, efforts will be on to augment and store excess power so that gradually, the entire day’s needs can be met.
 
 ER general manager Harindra Rao said: “We have a mandate from the Centre to go completely solar by 2025. We are starting with Howrah station and should be able to go solar within the stipulated deadline. Gradually, we will move towards other stations.”
