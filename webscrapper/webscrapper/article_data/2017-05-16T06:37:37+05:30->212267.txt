 Among the top vegetarian-friendly destinations and preferences of Indian vegetarian travellers are Dubai, UK and Singapore. Other destinations preferred for holidaying are the USA, Switzerland, Malaysia, Israel, Thailand, Australia and  .
 
 It also revealed that 85% of the younger generation (age group of 20-45) are open to cosmopolitan tours where they are served vegetarian food, whereas majority of the tra vellers from the age group of 46-65 years would opt for a group tour that assures vegetarian food.
