LUCKNOW: People from different walks of life came on a platform to create   awareness across India.

  in co-ordination with UP 32 Buleeteers group, flagged off on Tuesday a   to spread road safety awareness from   before culminating at Kanyakumari. 
 
 This also happens to be the first-ever rally aimed to create awareness about road safety in the city. Four men on bikes embarked on the journey that was flagged-off by ASP (Traffic) Habibul Hasan, who said that the rally was aimed at spreading awareness among masses about basic road-safety rules like wearing seat-belt in car and helmet on two-wheelers and following traffic lights.
 
 Wedding planner and avid biker Aditya Singh told TOI that this was his first-ever participation in a bike rally. “I am very enthusiastic about the journey as it is not just about adventure but also about contributing something to the society.”
 
 Seasoned biker Atul Mishra, who has also been to Ladakh on a motorcycle said it is an innovative way to spread awareness especially among youths who ride for thrill but don’t pay attention to the risk involved.
 
 When TOI asked about preparations one has to make before going on such excursions, Mishra said one should know how to study road map and be always in proper gear. The reliable biking attire comes for around Rs 6,000-15,000 and includes helmet, jacket, knee-guard and a bag.
 
 Ashutosh Soti, chairman and president of Soti Foundation said the journey will be spread out in six states and the boys will be covering a distance of 6,329km spread over a period of 15 days and will distribute pamphlets on road safety.
 
 “From Lucknow, they will head to Nagpur and from there to Munnar and after taking a day’s rest they will head to Rameswaram and then from to Kanyakumari where the rally will end,” Soti told reporters.
