Mark Ruffalo,  ,   and some other   celebrities are planning to attend a   protest, billed as a 'public alternative' to  's first State of the Union address. The event will unite activists, artists and other leaders of the resistance movement who have vowed to defeat Trump's agenda in 2018 by turning out the vote and helping Democrats win back Congress.

  
  
 According to report, "In essence, it's a better reflection of our state of the union based on a more populist point of view, based on the people's point of view," Ruffalo told.
 
  "I think it's important because we have a president who has a difficult time with the truth, who has a radical, divisive agenda, and spends an enormous amount of time focusing on the negative and hopelessness and despair," he added. The event will also mark the official launch of We Stand United, the lead host organisation of the event.
