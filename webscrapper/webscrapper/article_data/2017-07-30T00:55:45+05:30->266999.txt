NEW DELHI: A 22-year old Jawaharlal   student has alleged that he was beaten up by   personnel at Rajiv Chowk   for not removing his earphones when asked to do so during a security check. The student also alleged that the personnel hurled abuses at him and upon discovering that he was from JNU said he should be sent to Pakistan. CISF has denied the charges and ordered a probe into the incident.

 In a Facebook post which has since gone viral, Aman Sinha, a second-year MA History student, said the incident took place on Friday evening when he was entering the Metro station for a security check and was yelled at for not removing his headphones before being sent to the back of the queue after he didn’t do so. Sinha says a second CISF guard then came and started enquiring about him, asking him where he was from and his full name after which he was dragged to the station control room by them.
 
 “I told him only my first name but refused to tell them my caste or religion. I heard one of them saying ‘Pakistan bhejenge tum mussalay ko aaj’ before hurling more abuses at me. I was then dragged to the control room as they kicked and punched me,” Sinha told TOI. 
 
 CISF has denied the claims after an inquiry was launched suo motu, based on the Facebook post. “The student was wearing earphones and despite being asked to remove them twice, he refused to do so. He was sent to the back of the queue after which he got aggressive and started yelling at and abusing the security personnel. He was then taken to the station control room by officers despite resistance. We are probing the matter further,” said  , CISF DIG (Metro), adding that CCTV footage has been analysed and no   was witnessed on the cameras.
 
 It’s a general experience that CISF does a difficult job at the Metro stations quite competently. Officials said that the use of earphones and mobile phones during checking is prohibited as it hinders checking and often delays the queue.
