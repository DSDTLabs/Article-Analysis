On   morning, Hyderabad's ladies made a beeline for a   event at  . The ladies dipped their hands in some warm specially formulated wax in order to create a mould of their hands which were tinted with colours of their choice. And if that wasn't fun enough, the ladies were dressed in their stylish best as they posed for selfies, as the shutterbugs snapped away. It was a fun time indeed!
