MUMBAI: More than 5,000 people are expected to glow after their run in a very literal sense on March 4. 

 That's the turnout expected at  's MMRDA Grounds for the third edition of the   unique fitness event organized by   that apart from a 'zumba' warm-up session and three races also boasts a post-run EDM party where participants will wear neon glow-in-the-dark neckbands and wristbands.
 
 With 'Run. Dance. Party!' for its tagline, this party run is inspired by international neon theme-based runs and aims to blend fun and fitness, said organisers. Participants have three race categories to choose from-a 2 km non-timed family run, a 5 km non-timed dream run and a 10-km certified timed run. 
 
 They can then look forward to having fun with glow-in-the dark merchandise at the finale post-run EDM party organised by Sunburn. "When it started in 2015, Mirchi   was India's first neon theme-based run. This experience caters to people across different ages and fitness levels and ensures a fun-filled party run for the entire family," said an organizer. While the run was held only across three cities -Chennai, Indore and Ahmedabad-in 2017, this year's edition will be held across 11 cities including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Surat, Pune, Coimbatore, Delhi, and Hyderabad. Registrations for the event are now open on online portal BookMyShow.
