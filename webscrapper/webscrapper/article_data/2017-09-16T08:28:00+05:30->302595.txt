CHENNAI: The city police on Friday arrested a six-man gang for abducting a 60-year-old businessman from   on Thursday and demanding a ransom of Rs 80 lakh for his release.

 A day after the abduction, it emerged that Peer Mohammad, the son of Fakeer Mohammad, a resident of Nethaji Nagar and the owner of a furniture store in the locality, paid the gang a ransom of Rs 3 lakh for his father’s release.
 
 An investigating officer said the abductors scaled down the demand to Rs 25 lakh, after Fakeer said he did not have that much money, on the condition that they receive Rs 3 lakh as a first payment. They forced Fakeer to speak to his son and secure the money for his release. Police believe two of the gang members are associates of a wanted land mafia don from Kancheepuram.
 
 The officer identified the arrested men as Balakrishnan, 35, Sathya alias Bombay Raja, 25, Karthik, 27, Santhosh Kumar, 20, Abdul Ijiyaz, 27, and Jayakandhan, 20.
 
 The gang abducted the businessman, bundling him into a Maruti omni van, while he was on his way to a mosque near his house at 5am on Thursday, the officer said. They abandoned Fakeer on the roadside in Wallajah in Vellore district on Thursday evening after receiving Rs 3 lakh from his son in Vyasarpadi.
 
 “After Fakeer bargained with the abductors and reduced the ransom, they made him call his son and say he needed the money urgently for a business deal,” the officer said. “Fakeer then asked a friend to arrange for the money and hand it over to his son.”
 
 A police team headed by joint commissioner of police, north, R Sudhakar and deputy commissioner G Shashank Sai tracked down the abductors on Friday.
 
 “We learned that there was no previous ill will between Fakeer and the kidnappers,” a senior police officer said. “A local had tipped the suspects that Fakeer was wealthy and they assumed that they could abduct him for a large ransom.”
