The city once again came together to support and celebrate its   community at this year’s  . The fest, which kick-started on Wednesday with some power-packed performances by the LGBTQ community, is a five-day event. Apart from screenings of films across categories, this edition saw entries from several countries including UAE, Trinidad and Nigeria. In addition to these screenings, the festival will also host panel discussions, play  ,   sessions and workshops.

 Arjun Kapoor, who was the chief guest at the fest, said, “The LGBTQ community needs a voice and support, and cinema is the most powerful medium to reach out to people. I think they have put together a fabulous line-up of films.” 
 
 This year, too, the festival has a theme and it is ‘Diverse One’, an initiative that seeks to explore the diverse LGBTQ communities. There was a panel discussion titled Prejudice and Pride, which was about how open our society is to the community. Speakers elaborated on inclusive company policies and practices, which could be employed to make workplaces safe and conductive. It was also discussed whether or not the recommendations were enough for society to accept homosexuals and treat them as equals. Yesterday, a reading of the popular play Vagina Monologues took place, with a narrative by a member of the community.
