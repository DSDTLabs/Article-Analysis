AHMEDABAD: In their own unique way,   in Ahmedabad have been using   to fight crime and even to trace their belongings. Residents of Binori bungalows near Arohi club in Bopal-Ghuma area, for instance, shared a   video on TOI-Citizens Reporter about how they scared off four robbers who had entered the society. The CCTV footage helped residents spot them. The guards were alerted and began blowing their whistles, while residents in neighbouring homes raised an alarm. “This was the second time for robbers entering our premises. We did not want to become victims again. We need more police patrols in our area,” said a resident, Jaymin Mistry.

 In another instance,   of Braj bungalows in Thaltej area lost a bracelet worth Rs 70,000 at a hypermart in Law Garden area. She requested the hypermart owner for CCTV footage and saw a small boy innocently picking up her bracelet from the ground, playing with it for a moment and putting it in his pocket. “The boy had done this innocently, I think even his mother would not have known this. We have begun a social media campaign to help locate the bracelet with the CCTV footage and screenshots and I am quite hopeful we will find it soon,” said Patel.
