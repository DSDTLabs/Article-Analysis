The GHMC’s   scheme will be called ‘Annapurna’ and more outlets will be opened soon in the city and Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) limits. Responding to a request from Cantonment MLA G Sayanna, municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao said at least five to six outlets would be opened in the Cantonment area.

 Sayanna said that 20% of the   area falls in the Cantonment assembly constituency limits, but confusion over jurisdiction was denying the facility to the poor in the area. KTR said he would speak to the SCB CEO and finalise locations for the new outlets. A suggestion was also made to supply free drinking water along with the food to the people. tnn
