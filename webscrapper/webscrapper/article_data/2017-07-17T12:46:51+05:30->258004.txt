 and   have been busy with the shoot of their next film ‘Paisa Vasool’.

 The film that stars  , Charmee Kaur and newcomer Muskaan is scheduled to be completed by July 22, 2017. Reports state that the film’s unit is packing in back to back schedules to finish the film’s shooting on time. Balakrishna also reportedly plans to finish the shoot as soon as possible because he has other projects lined up. 
 
 The movie was first scheduled to hit the screens on September 29, 2017 during Dussehra. When the director and actor first announced the film’s release date on social media, the live video got 1 million views. But now, the makers might prepone the date and release it on a nearer date by rushing the post-production. 
 
 Balakrishna will be playing a gangster in the movie and seen romancing Shriya Saran in ‘Paisa Vasool’. The reason for the date change is said to be NTR’s ‘Jai Lava Kusa’ and Mahesh Babu’s ‘Spyder’ also releasing during Dussehra. September 1, 2017 looks to be the new release date for the movie.
