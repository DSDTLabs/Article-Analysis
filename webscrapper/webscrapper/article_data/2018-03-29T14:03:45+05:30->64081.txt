VADODARA: The voting for elections   (BCG) passed off peacefully at district court at   and four taluka courts at Karjan, Dabhoi, Savli and Padra.

 The voter turnout at the district court remained low since morning as compared to the voting percentage in talukas. Eight advocates from Vadodara are among the 99 candidates from state in fray for 25 seats of BCG.
 
 According to election commission officials of   (BBA), 1,492 advocates out of total 2,793 turned up to vote. The voting percent remained 55% which is quite low compared to 80% turnout during   polls in December last year. Sources said that around 15 lawyers could not cast their vote as their names were missing from the voters’ list.
 
 Several lawyers blamed the issue of seating arrangement in the district court for the low voter turnout. “Past and current office-bearers are also contesting in the polls and it is only because of them that proper seating arrangement was not made for us,” said lawyer. In Padra, 92 voters out of 104 turned up for voting while in Karjan 70 advocates out of 90 voted. In Savli out of 131 voters 93 voted and 87 advocates out of 127 voted in Dabhoi.
