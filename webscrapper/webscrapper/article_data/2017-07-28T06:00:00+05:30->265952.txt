KOLKATA: A Kashimiri youth was   on Thursday for posting suspicious comments on a social media platform on Tuesday, linking Kolkata and Kashmir to Pakistan.

 The youth, who sells shawls and woollen garments, was putting up at a guest house on Prince Anwar Shah Road but the police could not confirm how long he stayed there for. 
 
 His post was first noticed by some of his acquaintances in the neighbourhood, who allegedly roughed him before handing him over to officers at the Lake police station. The police, however, denied that the youth was physically assaulted by anyone.
 
 “A team of intelligence officials from the state and the Centre have been interrogating him. Officers of the Special Task Force also questioned him,” said a police officer.
