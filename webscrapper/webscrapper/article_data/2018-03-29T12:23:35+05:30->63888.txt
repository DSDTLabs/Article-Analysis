JAIPUR:   state president   on Wednesday accused chief minister   of warning people against holding protests and demonstrations against her government. Pilot said it was unfortunate that the chief minister was trying to curb people’s democratic rights to protest and raise demands.

 The Congress leader claimed that at one of the public hearings in   on Tuesday, Raje told people that they would get nothing if they continued to hold protests or demonstrations against the state government. “This clearly shows that the state’s BJP government wants to curb people’s rights. The NRHM employees who protested during the Prime Minister’s rally in Jhunjhunu recently are being tortured by the police at the directions of the state government,” Pilot alleged.
 
 Former chief minister Ashok   said there was lot of resentment against the Raje government and people were rooting for change in the state. Gehlot said that after winning 163 seats in 2013 assembly elections, the chief minister’s behaviour and conduct has been such that it was paining the people.
 
 The ex-CM said Raje’s proposed ‘Vikas Yatra’ next month would yield nothing as her government now stood “fully exposed”. “People will not be misled this time. Any kind of Yatra by the chief minister will not work,” Gehlot said, while talking to reporters at the PCC headquarters.
 
 Gehlot said that in her 'yatra' before the 2013 elections Raje made several promises, including 15 lakh jobs and protection to women but these remained unfulfilled. The former chief minister said that “Modi wave” helped BJP in forming government in the state in 2013 but now the people feel cheated. Gehlot said Congress would form the state’s next government following the assembly elections due this year.
