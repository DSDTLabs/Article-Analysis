LUCKNOW: Against chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s dream to see the state capital ranking among top 10 of the   Bharat Mission (SBM) in 2018,   and its private partner Eco-Green have extended the deadline to cover all houses of Lucknow under door-to-door   from August 31 to September 30. 

 LMC informed about the new deadline when principal secretary urban development Manoj Kumar Singh reviewed the cleanliness status of Lucknow on Tuesday. After Jyoti Envirotech failed to operate Shivri’s waste treatment plant to its full capacity and collect   from all houses, the contract was given to new firm Eco-Green earlier this year.
 
 But because of logistic issues, lack of manpower, confusion over bills, etc, the new company has missed several deadlines. When Singh expressed disappointment over Lucknow’s 269th rank in 2017’s survey and asked LMC to ensure it appears in top 10 of SBM 2018, LMC apprised him of the dispute with private sweepers in many colonies, which delayed garbage collection work by a month and that the system would be operational by September-end. 
 
 The minister said all garbage backlog at the plant should be treated on priority so that no waste is dumped at the site. He asked LMC to clean all bigger drains of the city. Singh stressed LMC should ensure round-the-clock cleaning around market and public places where garbage accumulation is higher. He ordered dustbins to be placed and toilets made in all slum areas on priority. Additional municipal commissioner P K Srivastava said, “We aim to achieve the target set by government by building toilets and regular disposal and treatment of garbage in the city.”
