MUMBAI: The daughter of a Hindutva outfit leader, who had married a man from another community, told the Bombay high court on Monday that she had come home of her own accord.

 Acting on a complaint filed by the woman’s husband Iqbal Choudhary,   worker Sunil Pumpwell was arrested last week. Choudhary had alleged that his in-laws had abducted his wife Reshma. He had also filed a habeas corpus petition in the   seeking directions to produce his wife. Advocate Sanjiv G Punalekar, who is representing Reshma’s parents, said that she told the court that she had returned home and was not harassed in any way.
 
 She also told the court that she would like to stay with her parents for now, said Punalekar. “We expect the petition will be disposed of. The court has given the woman the liberty to decide if she wants to live with her husband or parents. She has decided to stay with her parents as her mother is unwell,” he said.
