MUMBAI: Observing that it is usual for delayed complaints in   cases as families worry about honour, a   rejected the acquittal plea of a 35-year-old man accused of repeatedly raping a 11-year-old girl, and sentenced him to seven years'  .

 “There is no   so far as delay in lodging the report is concerned. There may be various reasons for the delay in lodging the report in rape cases. The main reason is the honour of the family. This may take time to lodge the report. In rape cases, therefore, the delay is bound to occur,” the court said.
 
 While the rape happened between 2011 and 2012, the widowed mother of the child managed to muster up the courage to file a complaint only after an NGO ran a programme against sexual harassment in her colony.
 
 In her statement before the court, the child said the accused was from their village and she used to refer to him as uncle since he was a family friend. She told the court that after raping her the first time, he threatened her by saying that his father was the village sarpanch so nothing would happen to him. During the second instance, he raped her after claiming that it would cure her cold.
 
 The mother, who the victim confided into, also told the court she did not register a complaint as the accused had threatened her. She said that it was a social worker who helped her lodge the complaint. Justifying the delay, the court said that the woman was raising the child as a single mother after the death of her husband and was facing great difficulty. “It seems from the conduct of the informant (mother) that she would not intend to get a stigma attached to the girl,” the court said.
