PUNE: The iconic   at the  , formerly known as Science Block, at the   ( ) was replaced with a new GPS-based system recently. 

 The Science Block, overlooking the parade ground, is an imposing edifice located on   within the academy.
 
 In its three storeys, it houses the physics, chemistry and basic engineering departments, classrooms, laboratories and the boxing ring. The building is topped by a silver dome resting on a 110ft high clock-tower, which bears a four-faced clock with a 9-foot diameter dial.
 
 An NDA authority told  , “The trouble started with the clock in 2005. A series of efforts were made to fix the problem but, because the spare parts were unavailable and neither were skilled technicians, the clock could not be fully revived.”
 
  Eventually, it was decided to replace the clock with a new GPS-based clock. “Each clock dial is connected to a GPS-based master control unit and illuminated with LED lights giving it an ultra-modern and aesthetically pleasing appearance,” the authority shared. 
 
 Former Air Chief PV Naik, an NDA alumnus, welcomed the move and said, “All lectures and the academy’s routine are directly connected to the clock. The siren’s clock is followed by every cadet at the academy. Although we have the technology, certain old practices should be followed at the military academy.”
