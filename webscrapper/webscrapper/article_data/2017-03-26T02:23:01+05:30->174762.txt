Over a hundred   protested at General Hospital on Saturday, demanding regularisation of their services and better wages. 

 The workers, who continued their stir for around two hours from 11am, claimed that CM Manohar Lal Khattar had last October promised to regularise   of all NHM workers and pay salary on a par with permanent health employees. 
 
 But even after four-five months, the government failed to keep the promises, they alleged.
