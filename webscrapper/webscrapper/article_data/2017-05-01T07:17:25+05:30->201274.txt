 Finally, he decided to file a case at the labour court. The court ordered the sponsor to pay salary arrears and to provide final exit visa stamped passport to Santosh. 
 
  
 
 
  Dammam: Malayali associations here have sought the help of Indian embassy to send a Keralite named   (53) -who has never visited his hometown in the past twenty three years- back to his home. A petition in this regard has been filed at the embassy. 
 
 They decided to intervene in the issue after Moideen's mother sent a letter to the associations requesting them to locate her son.
 
 Malayali volunteers then began a search for him and found him near the   fish market. Moideen said that he was employed at the fish market earlier but left the job after he met with an accident. 
 
 He also said that he had paid huge sum of money to a visa agent in the area and would return only after he gets his money back.
