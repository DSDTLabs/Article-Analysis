CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday issued a   Kanwar Pal Gujjar on a plea alleging favouritism in appointments of employees in the assembly.

 The main allegation against the speaker is that he had arbitrarily selected one Tej Pal, who belonged to his constituency and worked as his personal driver for around 15 years, on the post of ward and watch assistant.
 
 Besides the speaker, the assembly secretary, the selected candidate and members of the selection committee for the said post, have also been asked to file their replies on the contentions raised by the petitioner.
 
 The matter reached the HC in the wake of a petition filed by  , a resident of Sirsa district in Haryana.
 
 According to the petitioner, Tej Pal of Chhachhrauli in   district was earlier selected as record restorer on 89-day basis in the assembly by the speaker. He was later selected on the post of ward and watch assistant during a selection process in which no criteria were adopted. 
 
 It was also alleged that a selection committee member, Kuldip Waraich has been removed from the assembly after his law degree was found fake and that other members of committee were not competent to take interview as they had not completed their probation period.
 
 The petitioner also argued that he had passed his matriculation with 64% marks and Class XII with 72% marks, but the selected candidate had scored on 33% marks in matric.
 
 “Selected candidate had served for around 15 years as driver with   and he has now been selected in assembly by the speaker just to adjust him. The entire selection process was a mere eyewash with the purpose to select the speaker’s close aide,” argued the petitioner seeking directions to set aside Pal’s selection.
 
 After hearing the contentions, Justice P B Bajanthri asked all the respondents to file their replies on the issue by May 8.
