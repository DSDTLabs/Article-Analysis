SURAT: The   (SMC) will launch an   in the city from June 5 — World Environment Day — to September 15. The local body aims to plant nearly 1.5 lakh saplings and 50,000 trees during this period. At present, Surat has one of the lowest green cover among the cities in Gujarat mainly due to rapid urbanization. 

 SMC has 326 sq km area and population of 50 lakh people. An ideal green zone should have 20% of the total area covered by trees — one tree for three persons. The city requires at least 18 lakh trees according to this calculation. 
 
 In the past too, Surat had conducted massive plantation drives, but in the absence of proper care, they were not so successful. 
 
 “We are going to implement a robust monitoring system along with the plantation drive. We will see to it that whatever is planted survives in the coming two years. We will also help private individuals to protect the plants. This will help us grow tree cover by a couple of per cent,” municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said.
 
 “Our people will visit homes and create awareness on the need to plant trees and save environment. We will help people in planting and taking care of saplings,” said an official of SMC’s garden department. At least 15 types of shrubs and trees will be distributed to people. SMC also plans to plant 4,000 coconut trees along the lakes and ponds. 
 
 Loss of tree cover has led to rising temperature. Mercury is seen crossing 41°C on regular basis during summer. The average rainfall has dropped from 60 inches to about 40 inches in last three years, experts said.
