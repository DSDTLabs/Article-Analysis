GUWAHATI: The   ( ) has summoned former   chief minister TR   to its New Delhi office on Tuesday in connection with its investigation into the use of government funds for funding the Myanmar-based terror outfit   ( ). 

 Zeliang, who is now leader of the opposition in the Nagaland assembly, has written to the NIA seeking a later date for appearance. The first session of the newly-elected assembly, he said, will be held on Tuesday and as the leader of opposition, he has to be present. 
 
 The terror funding probe has been on since 2016, when the previous Naga People's Front (NPF)-led government was in power. "Zeliang, as a law-abiding citizen of the country, is ready to cooperate with any investigating agency. But the chief minister's office under Zeliang had nothing to do with the funding of banned organizations,"   media secretary Sebastian Zumvu said. He added, "The timing of the summons, despite the cooperation rendered from Day One, is conspicuously odd. Political motivation and vendetta surrounding the case cannot be ruled out."
 
 The NIA notice (a copy of which is with TOI), signed by NIA deputy superintendent of police Yogesh Rathore of the Guwahati unit, asks Zeliang, who is "acquainted with the circumstances of the case", to appear before the investigating officer, DSP Jasveer Singh, at the NIA headquarters in New Delhi.
