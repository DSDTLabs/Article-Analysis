FEROZEPUR: A   between Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) workers turned bloody after they resorted to use sharp-edged weapons and fired gun shots. Six persons at   under   of Ferozepur district got injured in the incident that took place on Friday late evening.

 District vice-president of SAD Pritam Singh Batth, who was one amongst the injured, has been referred to a hospital in Ludhiana and is stated to be critical. Guru Har Sahai station house officer (SHO) Ashok Kumar Handa said Batth had been cultivating 1.5 acres of panchayat land on contract during the SAD rule. When the Congress came to power in Punjab, Balkar Singh, who owes allegiance to the ruling party, managed to change the contract in his name, he said.
 
 On Friday evening, when Pritam along with his accomplices was going to the disputed field to transplant paddy, he was stopped by a group of Congress workers led by Balkar. After a heated argument, Balkar and his associates allegedly attacked Pritam with sharp-edged weapons. Sources claimed some gunshots were also fired during the clash, which injured Pritam, his brother Harjinder Singh and son Talwinder Singh, whereas three persons from Balkarâ€™s group also suffered injuries. As per information, the injured were rushed to different hospitals in Ferozepur and Ludhiana. 
 
 When contacted, Ferozepur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gaurav Garg said police had started investigating the matter and a case would be registered shortly after recording the statements of the injured persons. Meanwhile, heavy police force has been deployed at Chak Haraj to prevent any untoward incident following the clash.
