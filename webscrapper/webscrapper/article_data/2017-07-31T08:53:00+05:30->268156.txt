CHANDIGARH: If farm loan waiver is a catch-22 for Punjab government, it is a huge puzzle for the banks also.

 While banks are apprehensive over a dip in recovery of crop loans for the present quarter, some in the state have already faced a dismal agricultural advance recoveries for the previous financial year itself. According to figures compiled by the state level bankers’ committee (SLBC), Punjab, banks like Dena Bank, Syndicate Bank and Axis Bank had recoveries of less than 5% for agricultural loans.
 
 On the other hand,   (BoI) topped the list with 93.90% recoveries for the agriculture advances, followed by 95.91% for Punjab National Bank (PNB), 86.88% for HDFC, 85.07% for Bank of Baroda (BOB) and 77.05% for   ( ).
 
 Overall, recoveries of agricultural loans for the previous year as on March 31, 2017 were 77.12% as against the 87.88% in March 2016. The sector-wise recovery of priority sector advances shows that the over demand for agriculture sector was for Rs 34,670 crore and total recoveries were Rs 24, 739 crore.
 
 The percentage recovery of agricultural loans was 87.54% in March 2015 and 87.88% for March 2016, which is considerably high vis-a-vis other sectors. For March 2017, however, the recovery ratio dipped to 77.12 %, a decline of 10.76% from previous year.
 
 Meanwhile, in a meeting with bankers from the region last week, state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal sought details of farmers who have availed loans so that waiver can be linked to their Aadhaar cards to avoid duplication.
 
 Sources said the cash-strapped state government is studying various options, and one could be to waive loans up to Rs 2 lakh for all marginal farmers, even if they have bigger outstanding loans. But in case of small farmers, only those who have pending loans of up to Rs 2 lakh could be taken on board. “However, the state government has still not made up its mind,” said an official.

 The indecision on the part of the government to fix a cut-off date for loan is also making banks restive. The SLBC has asked the state government to clear the confusion as it is leading to higher default in repayment by farmers, who are hoping to get included in the waiver plan. The state government has made allocation of Rs 1,500 crore for 2017-18 but has still not prepared the roadmap.
