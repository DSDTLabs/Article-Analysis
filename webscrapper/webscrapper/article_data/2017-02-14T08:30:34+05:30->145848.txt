KOTTAYAM: The statements of Mar Thoma church head Joseph Mar Thoma   on the restriction of women at   venue has come as a shocker to a those who have been seeking to lift the curb.

 The Metropolitan, in his speech during the inauguration of the convention on Sunday, had said that restricting women from the meetings held during night was part of the tradition and the faithful won't allow any change.
 
 Several sections of the church have raised objection to the views.  , a member of the church, said it was purely against women. “He should have at least said that he will consider the demand for lifting the restriction. He was adamant and it amounted to insult of women,” she said.
 
 “The curb is not part of the tradition. It was imposed due to some issues that had happened long ago. Despite the demand to lift the restriction, it has been continuing for years,” said Sonia, who is also the secretary of Kerala chapter of Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA) union.
 
 A V Itty, a senior member of Reformation Forum of the Mar Thoma church, said there was no official document that supported the restriction. “The curb was imposed at a time when there was no light and security facilities during night hours. It was an unofficial decision. Now the convention area is like a stadium with floodlights,” said Itty, a retired professor. 
 
 Adding that women sit on river banks to listen to speeches of the convention at night, he said the Metropolitan refused to have a dialogue with the forum.
