AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday ordered   to remove the   (ECI) as party respondent from his petition challenging the victory of Congress leader Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections last year.

 Justice Bela Trivedi asked Rajput to amend his petition and remove his prayer challenging the EC order by which two votes of Congress MLAs, who had cross-voted, were invalidated leading to Patel’s victory. The HC said that Rajput can question the EC order during his arguments.
 
 Patel’s advocate Kapil Sibal had raised the issue of maintainability of Rajput’s prayer with regard to impleadment of EC as a party respondent.
 
 On Monday, advocate Sibal moved another application seeking dismissal of Rajput’s petition on the ground that Patel was not served a “true copy” of the petition, which is against the rules governing election petition. He said that the copy of the petition served upon his client was not properly attested, was blank at some places, and the procedures required under the high court rule were not followed.
 
 Earlier, Rajput’s advocate had submitted that EC was a necessary party in the litigation because its decision was under challenge. It was the EC order that had affected the outcome of the election result.
 
 Rajput, who was fielded by   after his defection from the Congress, lost the Rajya Sabha election to Patel after EC invalidated the votes of former Congress MLAs Raghavji Patel and Bholabhai Gohel. This happened after Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil raised objection to their alleged flouting of poll conduct by showing their votes to other people than the party’s polling agent.
 
 Further hearing on the election petition will take place on April 6.
