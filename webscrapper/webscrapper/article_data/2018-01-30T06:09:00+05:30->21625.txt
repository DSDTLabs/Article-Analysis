GREATER NOIDA: A three-year-old child was allegedly raped by a “frequent visitor” to the house who locked her five-year-old sister in a room in  .

 The alleged assault took place when the children’s grandmother had gone to the market and the two were alone in the house.
 
 Sources said the girls stayed with their grandparents in a Greater Noida colony while their father worked as a labourer in   district. The girls’ mother passed away a few years ago. 
 
 Local residents said the accused had entered the house around 11.30am when he noticed that the two children were alone at home.
 
 “He is a frequent visitor to their house. He entered the house and tried to assault the elder child first. But she apparently bit his hand. He locked the elder girl in the other room and raped the younger sister,” said Eta I RWA president  .
 
 Alerted by the girl’s cries, when neighbours started gathering, the accused fled the house before anyone could see him, sources said. 
 
 When the grandmother arrived, she saw the child bleeding and went to the RWA members who called up police. Sources said the girl and her grandmother were made to sit on the floor of the police station as the cops kept asking questions. They allegedly delayed sending the child to the hospital for a medical test. 
 
 “The elder girl identifies the youth by face but doesn’t know his name. He was a regular visitor. We will lodge an FIR once we receive a written complaint,” Surajpur SHO   said.
