BENGALURU: The   ( ), which has launched a drive for garbage segregation at source, has told its pourakarmikas to identify houses where residents are showing resistance to or ignoring segregation.

 Houses continuing to give mixed waste will be marked with red and BBMP workers will meet them to seek reasons for non-compliance and educate them on the benefits of segregation.
 
 Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, solid waste management, BBMP, said he had been monitoring the segregation drive and link workers play a crucial role in educating people. “Link workers will be visiting houses of people who are not cooperating with segregation from next week,” he added.
 
 A senior official with the solid waste management wing of the BBMP said that the houses cooperating with the drive will be marked with green and those that are irregular marked with yellow. “We will ask link workers to speak to residents of yellow-marked houses as well so that they also follow segregation model completely,” he added.
 
 The official said marking of segregation or non-segregation will be made on the walls or gates of the houses. “The pourakarmikas will keep a diary in which house numbers and details will be entered. The same will be handed over to link workers for further action,” he added.
 
 Though BBMP said it will impose penalty on people not segregating waste, it will decide at the end of the month. Khan said the response to the segregation drive has been good. “When we started the segregation drive in the first week of February, the city used to segregate only 30% to 45% of the total waste generated. Now it has gone up to 60%. We are getting 1,200 tonnes of wet waste every day and the aim is to reach around 1,700 tonnes per day, which will be the optimal capacity,” he added.
 
 BBMP has told pourakarmikas to collect only wet waste every day. Dry waste is collected only twice a week.
