KOLKATA: A   and his steed were severely injured when a recklessly speeding taxi dashed into them near the Maidan on Monday evening.
Police sources said that Sergeant  , 37, from Kanchrapara in North 24-Parganas, was leading a group of six mounted police officers. He was seated on top of Gore-keeper, a race horse that was handed over to the mounted police from the Race Course. Gore-Keeper, 14 years old, has years of experience managing crowds at Eden Gardens, East Bengal,   and   grounds.
 
 “On Monday , he had crossed the eastern flank of the road and was half-way on the western flank, when a yellow cab sped past other vehicles that had stopped to allow the horses to pass through.Gore-Keeper sensed danger and leapt in the air. His attempt saved him and the rider getting hit head-on. However, even as it got hit on its legs, Tanoj fell on the road and the horse, too, fell soon after,“ said another officer who was part of the group.
 
 Tanoj suffered severe head and waist injuries and had to be admitted to CMRI Hospital. He has been kept under observation in the ICU. The horse sustained injuries in at least two legs and bled a lot. It has been moved to a stable near Chandni Chowk. “We will have to wait till Wednesday to ascertain how severe the horse's injuries are,“ said a senior officer.
 
 This is not the first time that a horse has fallen prey to reckless driving. In 2009, Caesar's Hawk, a 17-year-old horse of the mounted police, was knocked down by a senior cop's car. The driver of the vehicle,  , was arrested and a case initiated against him. The car belongs to the then deputy commissioner of police (SCO-II) S R Roy , who was in the vehicle at the time of the accident. Caesar's Hawk, who had been in police service for several years, and its rider Shankar Roy were doing the rounds of the Maidan with other mounted police horses near Plassey Road when the accident occurred.
