BAGAHA/PATNA: Police arrested four persons on Friday night on charges of thrashing a girl by tying her to a pillar at Kathaiya village under   police station area in   district. The girl was “punished” by the local panchayat for allegedly posting the photograph of another village girl on social media.

 The arrested persons have been identified as   (25), Hansraj   (27), Kanwal Kumar (22) and   (23). Bagaha SP Arvind Kumar said a police team led by sadar SDPO Sanjeev Kumar arrested the quartet on the basis of an FIR lodged with the   police station.
 
 “The area is dominated by Tharu tribes. The girl had a dispute with another village girl. She was barred by the local panchayat from meeting her. The incident occurred on Thursday when the victim visited the house of the girl with whom she had a dispute. The tribes hardly approach police. None from the village contacted the police even when the girl was thrashed,” the SP said, adding the four arrested persons are relatives of the girl, whom the victim met on Thursday.
