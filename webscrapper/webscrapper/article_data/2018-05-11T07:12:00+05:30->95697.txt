Pankaj had left home for his office located on Meerut Road at around 5am on Thursday. 

 “After finishing some loading work, he was driving home. A private chartered bus drove up from behind and hit his scooter. The victim lost balance and fell on the road. The front left wheel of the bus ran over his head, killing him instantly,” the victim’s cousin, Vijay, told TOI.
