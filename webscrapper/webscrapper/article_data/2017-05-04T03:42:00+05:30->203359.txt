Panaji: The Goa State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has dismissed an appeal from a Pernem man and directed him to pay the pending bills to PWD. The consumer disputes redressal forum, North Goa, had directed PWD to deduct Rs 3,731 from the future bills of Jaideep Amre of Dhargal and recover all the dues since 2014. The North Goa forum passed the order after Amre approached it alleging that the bills were fake and bogus and sought a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for mental anguish. Amre’s advocate submitted that the PWD after a gap of over three years, in September 2012, suddenly presented a water bill of Rs 79,720. Claiming that the bills should have been issued regularly without any time gap, he said it was gross negligence and deficiency in service on the part of PWD. But the lawyer representing the government and the PWD said it was obligatory on the part of the consumer to enquire about the bills if it has not been presented. He also said the consumer even enquired about the water meter that was installed in 2009 but made no attempts to make any payment. The commission in its order stated that it appreciated the PWD’s sincerity and honesty while admitting the fact that they delayed issuing water bills and also appreciated the department’s gracefulness shown to the complainant by reducing the amount from Rs79,720 to Rs 5,569. In its order, the commission stated that the complainant should have paid the outstanding dues of Rs 5,569 on water bills between 2009 and 2012 and settled the matter rather than resorting to litigation. It also put the onus on the consumer to request for bills if they do not receive it on time. “It is the duty of complainant as a consumer to approach the concerned departments with grievances and get it solved and also to rectify the errors done by the concerned department. He should have approached the opposite parties on his own even though the bills were not issued to him by the opposite parties ,” it said.
