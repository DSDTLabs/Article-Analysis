PUNE: Girls in 19 secondary schools run by   ( ) will get free sanitary napkins from the social welfare department.

 An annual budget of over Rs 4 lakh has been set aside and the napkins are being distributed since last year. Reports show that girls drop out of school if they don’t have sanitary napkins. Activists want Pune Municipal Corporation to adopt the same scheme.
 
 The plan was approved by the standing committee last year. The napkins were received by January 30, 2016. “A sanitary napkin is one of the biggest needs. Our women and child welfare committee decided to give the students free napkins so that they don’t miss school,” Sambhaji Aiwale, community development officer at Urban Community Development Department in PCMC, said.
 
 About 12-15 pads are given to every girl student in a month. “The distribution is done by an agency appointed to make these napkins. At present, we have   in the secondary division which are for students studying in standard VII to X. There are 4,310 girls studying in secondary classes,” Aiwale added.
 
 Ingrid Mendonca, founder member of  , said, “The idea should be replicated by other civic bodies. Just like the midday meal, health check-up and free uniform, sanitary napkins should become a part of things given to girls. They should be told how to use and dispose it of. Many girls use cloth but napkins can be a better and hygienic way. This will encourage them to come to school,” she said.
