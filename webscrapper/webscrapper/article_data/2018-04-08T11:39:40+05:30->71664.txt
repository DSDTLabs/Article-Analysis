AMARAVATI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu  , after a meeting with representatives of various associations on Saturday, has decided to form two committees to provide impetus to the special category status ( ) agitation. While one committee will coordinate with like-minded parties and organisations, the other will plan the strategies to take the agitation forward. 

 Among those present at the meeting were representatives of SCS forum Chalasani Srinivas and actor Pothineni Sivaji, Uttarandhra forum leader and former minister Konatala Ramakrishna, AP NGOs leader P Ashok Babu, JAC Amaravati president Bopparaju Venkateswarlu, Secretariat employees leader Murali Krishna, Samata Party leader V V Krishna Rao, Visalandhra Mahasabha leader Nallamothu Chakravarthi, journalist union leaders Subba Rao, Krishnanjaneyulu and others. 
 
 The CM criticised the YSR Congress, Congress and Jana Sena for boycotting the meeting. However, he remained silent on the CPI and CPM's absence, only saying that Left parties have their own strategies.
 
 Naidu said that he had met several national level leaders at Parliament and briefed them on the injustice done to the state. All the leaders sympathised with our stand and will support our demand for special category status, the CM said, adding that his two-day stay in the national capital gave him the chance to explain injustice being done to the state by the Centre.
 
 The CM also hinted at a conspiracy on the release of the book on Amaravati written by former chief secretary I Y R Krishna Rao, asking why did Pawan Kalyan release the book dedicated to Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao.
