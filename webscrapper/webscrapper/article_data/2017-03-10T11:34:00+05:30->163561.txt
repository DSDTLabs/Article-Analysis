Gandhinagar: In an unprecedented incident, the state government was forced into damage control when minister of state for industries   said that the central government should also withdraw the new Rs2000 and Rs500 notes, to curb corruption. Alarmed, deputy CM   quickly clarified that the views of the minister were personal and the ruling   government does not endorse them. 

 While discussing Value Added Tax (VAT) revenue in Valsad district, BJP MLA Zankhana Patel of Choryasi sought to know if the demonetization of November 8 had an impact on VAT revenue in Valsad. “The Union government should withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes to curb corruption,” said Rohit Patel during this debate.
 
 The statement by the junior industries minister left the ruling party MLAs and senior ministers stunned. Just as Rohit Patel completed his reply, deputy CM and finance minister Nitin Patel announced, “Speaker sir, I need to clarify that the views expressed by the minister are his personal views and the government does not endorse them.”
 
 The   raised an uproar over the minister’ statement and demanded that Rohit Patel apologize and withdraw his statement. Speaker Ramanlal Vora said there was no need, as the senior minister and deputy chief minister had already issued a clarification.
 
 Rohit Patel had stated that VAT income after demonetization had increased and there was no adverse effect of demonetization on VAT income. He further said that demonetization was a good move and only PM   could take such a bold step. He said that the move was to fight corruption and black money in the country. “I would go to the extent of saying that the Union government should even withdraw the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes.”
 
 As the minister continued to speak on demonetization for three or four minutes, the speaker asked him to reply to the MLA’s question. When Patel continued, even CM Vijay Rupani turned and told him to shorten his reply.
