LUCKNOW: Mayor   on Wednesday took officials to task for providing misleading information to her on fogging status in the city. During a review meeting, the mayor expressed disappointment over the lax attitude of environment and health officials. While she was told that 60 vehicles had been engaged for fogging, during the review, she found that only 19 were operational. 

 She reprimanded the team for misleading   and sought a report on the roster for daily fogging, which began on March 26.
 
 TOI had recently carried a series of articles highlighting LMC's laxity in taking up exercises required to check the mosquito menace. TOI reports also highlighted that fogging infrastructure was being underutilised by LMC and the activity was restricted to select areas.
 
 Since overflowing drains and garbage piles are a major factor responsible for the rise in the mosquito population, the mayor directed engineers and sanitary department to ensure cleaning of all drains by May 31.
 
 She also asked LMC to add corporators to a social media group created to deal with drain cleaning.
 
 Bhatia also said corporators should be provided with LMC's permission letter and map of the area where road-cutting has to take place to supervise such work.
 
 Taking note of reckless road cutting, she ordered FIRs against contractors and action against engineers exceeding the cutting area.
