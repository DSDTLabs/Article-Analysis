NAGPUR: Though the local education department has started disbursing payments against pending  , schools in the city say they have not received the full amount.

 Maharashtra English Schools Trustees Association (MESTA) claimed that on an average, hardly 25% of the pending bills have been cleared. 
 
 Khemraj  , Nagpur district chief of MESTA, said, “The bill payments have to be looked into with great detail to get a complete idea. For each academic year, the government has released money but it is just a fraction of what is due to us.”
 
 TOI had reported on Wednesday that another Rs29 crore has been received by the education department. Kondhe said, “The money is again not for the entire bills submitted by schools. They are giving some amount to schools for all academic years, so at least the paperwork starts.”
 
 A multi-branch CBSE school’s trustee told TOI that in their case, a very small amount has been given. “The entire bill pending with the department in my case is almost Rs1 crore. The latest amount that was approved is around Rs2 lakh. They say more may get approved and distributed but nobody knows when,” the trustee said.
 
 These pending payments are the reason that schools have boycotted admission but are going about it in a diplomatic way. A trustee said, “We are delaying the admission process by citing insufficient documentation. A directive from our association clearly mentioned that we must not refuse admissions as it will create problems for parents. Our problem is not at all with the parents or kids, it is the government that has caused the entire misunderstanding.”
 
 SC Kedia, convener of   (FSM), said, “We have asked the education department to give us a detailed break up of which schools they have paid. We want to know which schools have received money and how much was originally due to them.”
 
 The schools-education department face-off is currently on the back burner because RTE admission deadline has been extended till April 13.
