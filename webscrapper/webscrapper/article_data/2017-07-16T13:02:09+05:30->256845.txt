NAGPUR: Friends of 20-year-old Akshay Mhaske, who was critically injured in an accident on Friday night, had advised him to take the   to the garage as it's leg and hand brakes were not functioning properly.

 The mangled killer car, now parked at   police station, would soon be tested by RTO experts to ascertain the cause of the accident. Police have also sent blood and urine samples of Akshay to the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory for testing. 
 
 Senior PI of Sadar police station   said that they are investigating the cause of the accident. “As Akshay is medically unfit, we are looking for other options,” he said. 
 
 Source close to Akshay told TOI that his friend too had trouble with the car’s brake when he had taken it out for a drive. 
 
 Akshay lost control over the car near the Sadar railway quarters and rammed into a signage and tree, leading to the deaths of his two friends   (18) and   (19). Akshay is fighting for life at a private hospital.
 
 A family source said that a surgery was performed on Akshay on Saturday. There is still no clarity on where the trio were coming from and heading to.
