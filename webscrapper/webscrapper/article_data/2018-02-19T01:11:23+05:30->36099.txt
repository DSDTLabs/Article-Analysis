MUMBAI: Two out of three   road department engineers—i.e. 181 out of the total 270—have been indicted for lapses in road work in probe reports presented to the municipal commissioner. 

 The involvement of such large number of engineers comes as no surprise considering that the then chief engineer of the department had also been arrested in the  . “With the chief engineer also being involved, the involvement of junior level staff like sub engineers, junior engineers therefore comes as no surprise,” said an official. This was also the first time that BMC registered an FIR against contractors. 
 
 The BMC’s inquiry committee found that in most cases, engineers were hand in glove with contractors, which gave the latter a free hand in doing a shoddy road work.
 
  
  
 The scam, which came to light in 2015, was probed in two phases. In the first phase, 96 engineers were found guilty. While four of them have been dismissed, the rest faced various kinds of punishments from stoppage in increments to fines. Charges against four others had been dropped.
  
 The BMC inquiry committee is in the process of finalising the second phase report. An official said 84 of them have been found guilty in the second phase too.
 
 According to a senior BMC official privy to the inquiry, municipal commissioner   on Saturday took a review of the second phase of the probe, asked for punishment to be given to engineers to be fixed. “The second phase inquiry has concluded that 169 engineers were involved. The quantum of the punishment is yet to be decided,” said the official. The final report with the quantum of punishment is likely to be ready next week and then submitted to the BMC commissioner.
