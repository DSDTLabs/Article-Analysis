Surat:   

 Surat Airport Action Committee (SAAC) has threatened to launch an indefinite hunger strike if it fails to achieve the desired results after October 1. 
 
 A letter in this connection was sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju demanding international operations from Surat airport before assembly elections are announced.
 
 SAAC president Sanjay Ezhawa shared the official documents gathered from central and state governments regarding the development of Surat international airport. 
 
 Ezhawa stated the PMO office has accepted Gujarat government’s proposal for development of international airports in Surat and Vadodara. However, there was no mention in the documents gathered from the meeting held at Gandhinagar regarding Gujarat’s civil aviation sector development in January 2015.
 
 Sources said Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) is yet to approve the customs notified status for Surat airport. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had sent the customs airport proposal to the CBEC seven months ago. 
 
 “We had sent several letters to the central government from February 2017 to September 30 requesting for approval of a customs notified status to the airport in order to resume international operations. In the past, the group had several meetings with the civil aviation ministry, AAI and other departments, but in vain. Many people associated with me will sit on hunger strike from morning to evening at the airport gate on October 1. If the demand for international airport is not met, then the group will launch an indefinite hunger strike,” Ezhawa said.
