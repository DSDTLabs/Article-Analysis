TRICHY: Akshaya Tritiya festival, which was celebrated on Wednesday, received a mixed response from residents in the city.

 While some managers and proprietors of leading jewellery shops in   claimed that people thronged in large numbers at their shops, a few stated that business was significantly low compared to that of previous years.
 
 On Akshaya Tritiya, making new investments in gold or other precious metals is considered to be auspicious.
 
 But the concept of the festival seems to have transformed to a certain extent. Instead of just investing in gold because it is auspicious, people generally visit jewellery shops during the Akshaya Tritiya season since several offers are available.
 
 “More than for religious reasons, the sales during Akshya Tritiya is transforming into something similar to a ‘Aadi disocunt’ offer,” said a senior manager at a leading jewellery shop in the city. “People came to our shops in numbers because of many lucrative offers. Not only jewellery business, but even others came up with Akshaya Tritiya offers,” he said.
 
 Since May is a wedding season, many customers purchased jewellery on Wednesday in advance to make use of the offers. “We are very happy with the response for Akshaya Tritiya. This day still remains one of the most profitable days for our business,” said managing partner of Mangal and Mangal, P Mookapillai.
 
 On the other hand, GST imposition served as a huge blow for the sales of jewellery, according to proprietor of   in Trichy, G Dhamodharan. “I have never seen a dull Akshaya Tritiya like this. I even spoke to jewellery shop owners in other cities and they too had the same opinion. GST has in fact been a body blow,” he said.
