AHMEDABAD: In a major development in the   smuggling case busted by   ATS with the arrest of five carriers, three from Kutch and two from Kerala, it has come to light that a man named  , based in Dubai, had sent the 3kg gold consignment to be delivered to a person in Kerala. 

 "We have begun the process to write to the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to identify the person named Hussain. We have also contacted our Kerala counterparts to trace the intended recipients," said a senior crime branch official.
 
 Amid the tight security arrangements at the Ahmedabad airport, three persons from Kutch - Razak Mathad, Ramzan Sindhi and  , working as labourers in Dubai for about four months - managed to sneak out the gold hidden in the cabinets of three mixer-grinders.
