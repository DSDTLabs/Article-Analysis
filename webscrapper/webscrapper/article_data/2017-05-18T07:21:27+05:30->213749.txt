IDUKKI: The government apathy to the winter vegetable farmers of Kanthalloor and Vattavada is continuing, despite tall promises to form a special agricultural zone at Devikulam. 

  The government had also promised low-interest loans for farmers from the  . But, as the government has once again failed to keep its word and the next season just three months away, the farmers were forced to collect advance payment from vendors in  .
 
  The farmers are really in a soup as they have to silently suffer the exploitation by Tamil Nadu vendors with the Horticorp failing to pay them on time. "We have stopped giving Horticorp vegetables from February onwards,"   president Jayaprakash said. 
 
  In this year's budget, the government announced establishment of special agricultural zones in the state. It also allotted Rs 10 crore in the budget for the development of five special agricultural zones (SAZs) in the state where winter vegetables are cultivated in 1,150 hectares at Vattavada and 711 hectares at Kanthalloor.
 
  However, farmers complain that the project is still in limbo. Under the project, the government was planning to form joint liability groups under Krishi Bhavans to assist farmers and distribute low interest loans through Gramin Bank. The government also announced the opening of three bank branches at Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Devikulam but only one branch has been opened at Vattavada so far.
 
 Meanwhile, Devikulam agricultural special zone special officer N S Josh denied the allegations. " The works of the special agricultural zone are going smooth. The Gramin Bank branches will distribute loans to the farmers next week. The agriculture department would ensure total vegetable procurement from Kanthalloor and Vattavada from the next season," he said.
