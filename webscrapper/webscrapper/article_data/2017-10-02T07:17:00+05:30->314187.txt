Ludhiana: Tipped off about illegal mining allegedly being conducted under Nakodar Bridge on Sutlej river, MLA Dakha and senior AAP leader H S Phoolka, along with his team members, raided the area on Saturday night. Acting on his complaint, Sidhwan Bet Police seized a trolley from the area and booked unidentified miscreants.

 The AAP leader said they received information from sources that illegal mining is being done under Nakodar bridge on the state highway in Sidhwan Bet area for the last three days. He said he knew no license had been given to anyone and no auction had been held due to the monsoon season and went to the spot to check.
 
 Phoolka alleged that the miscreants, in their hurry to get away, left a trolley behind, which was handed over to the police. “We were shocked to see that they had removed sand from five to six feet around the bridge, weakening the structure. According to guidelines issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), no sand mining is allowed from around 500 metres of bridges on the rivers. But it seems the sand mafia has no fear of the government,” he said. 
 
 Saying that he had called for the suspension of the district mining officer, the AAP leader said he would take up the matter with the director, mining. “We will also move NGT and file a contempt petition as its guidelines were being flouted”, said MLA Dakha. Earlier, he said, the sand mafia enjoyed the patronage of Akali leaders and now the Congress leaders. 
 
 Police said action will be taken on the complaint. “We have registered a case under the Mining Act against the unidentified accused and are trying to identify them”, said inspector Paramjeet Singh, SHO, Sidhwan Bet police station.
