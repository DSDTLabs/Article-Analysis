MOHALI: The   (CoA) has written to all state bodies asking representatives to appear before chairman  , in an effort to gauge the mood within the India cricket board ( ) and get some clarity on the thought process of member associations ahead of the May 7 special general meeting ( ). Representatives from the north and east zones have been asked to meet   on May 5 while west and south zone representatives have been told to meet on May 6 in the Capital.

 Central zone representatives, meanwhile, have been divided into two groups who will meet the CoA on both the days. The CoA, it is understood, wants to sense the mood following India's decreased revenue share from the  's coffers and talk of India's possible pullout from the Champions Trophy.
 
 It is understood that if BCCI's state bodies are reluctant to take part in the ICC event in England, the matter will be reported back to the   and further guidance will be sought. As of now, however, the possibility of a pullout looks remote, with even former BCCI bosses having made it clear to the current dispensation that the move would not be in India's best interests.
 
 "There is no point harping on the same issue over and over again. The 2014 model is rejected and there is no point talking about it," an insider explained to TOI on Saturday.
