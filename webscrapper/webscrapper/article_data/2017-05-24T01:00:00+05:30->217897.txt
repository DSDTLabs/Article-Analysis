A single from Gautham Karthik’s  , composed by debutant  , will be released today. This song, titled Foreign Return, written by Lallu and Kadal, has been crooned by Anirudh. Talking about the single track,   says, “This is an out-and-out kuthu number and we have infused popular Burmese words in the song.   has sung in a different dialect to pronounce Burmese words like aththo and moinga. This song is set against the backdrop of a north Madras wedding.”

 The film is about a Burmese family, which has settled in the city, and that’s why the team decided to include Burmese in this song, he adds. About the other songs in the album, he says, “There is a song on the lines of New York jazz club numbers. And there is a song written by late lyricist Na Muthukumar, Yaathriga, which will be an emotional and soulful one. The album has songs in different genres.”
 
 While Vikram has composed the songs,   has been roped in to compose the background score for the film. Ask Vikram about this, and he says, “That is purely director, Rajkumar’s call. He wanted two music directors — one for songs and the other for the background score.”
