Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Monday accepted the apology tendered by Vadodara Municipal Commissioner, Vinod Rao, who was pulled up for sending a WhatsApp message to the judge in connection with a pending matter.

 Justice R H Shukla made Rao apologize for sending the message and the court on Monday said that the bureaucrat should be careful in future.
 
 The HC earlier lambasted Rao for sending the text message and said that bureaucrats behave like dictators. Later, Rao tendered an “unconditional” and “unqualified” apology and assured the court that he will never repeat the mistake in the future. Rao had urged the judge to decide a case early, which pertains to the demolition of a building near the railway station, and he wrote, “Pls help us to help the city.”
