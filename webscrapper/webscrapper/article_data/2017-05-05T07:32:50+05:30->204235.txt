 Assistant police inspector in-charge of Kodoli police station Vikas Jadhav, said, “As per the complaint lodged by Shitale’s relatives, he had borrowed a loan worth Rs 1 lakh from a nationalised bank in 2016. He had already paid the major instalments except for the instalments in the last three months.”
 
 “We have registered a case under section 174 of CrPC (unnatural death). We are gathering the post mortem report and details about the loan that he had borrowed so that we can draw some conclusion about the cause of his death,” he said.
 
 Stating this as farmer’s suicide, a leader from Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna and Member of Parliament   said, “It is sad that many farmers from western Maharashtra are forced to commit suicide. Shitale's daughter told me that she was working in a grocery shop along with her father to meet the needs of the family. She had borrowed Rs 5,000 from grocery shop to pay the pending instalments. The bank officials were harassing her father to pay the complete amount immediately. The government should take note of this incident and investigate the case thoroughly.”
