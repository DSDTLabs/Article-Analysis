Thane: A   was resuced and released after it fell into a four-feet deep open   along the Ghodbunder Road on Friday. 

 Animal activists in the lake city, however, are upset that the cow was not taken to any vet or animal hospital for treatment.
 
 The unescorted cow, which had slipped into an open nullah opposite the Anand Nagar bus stop, was rescued by officials of the regional disaster management cell ( ) and fire brigade during a 20-minute-operation on Friday evening.
 
 While activists lauded the efforts by the authorities to rescue the trapped bovine, they are upset that the officials had not handed the injured cow to a veterinarian or an animal hospital to treat possible wounds.
 
 “While officials saw no external injuries, the cow could have faced internal injuries during the fall. The fact that she was pregnant was all the more reason for the officials to admit her to the nearest animal hospital or at least hand her over to a vet. Now that the animal is left on her own, there is no way of knowing whether she is alright,” said an animal activist.
 
 Santosh Kadam from the RDMC said, “The area was slippery and the cow walked right into the open  . Luckily the nullah was not a deep one and only the legs of the cow were submerged in the filthy water. We had taken an emergency tender and a rescue vehicle and managed to pull out the cow by tying wire ropes around her body, legs and head and lifting her out. The cow looked pregnant and as it didn’t have any injuries, we let it go,” he said.
