Singer-actor   says he finds the idea of making an R-rated version of 'Camp Rock' great. The 24-year-old singer starred alongside his brothers Joe and   as well as   in the two hit Disney musical movies 'Camp Rock' and '  2: The Final Jam', which were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively.

  
  
 "If the right thing comes together, I think that'd be fun. It's a really delicate thing because (they're two films) really beloved by fans. So I think for it to work, it'd have to be some creative new version where we get a writing team and do something special. But I absolutely love working with Demi and my brothers," Nick said.
