AHMEDABAD: With   prices skyrocketing over the last couple of months, imports and gold consumption have dipped significantly. With prices firm, exchange of old gold jewellery and bars for new purchases has increased. Estimates by jewellers indicate that at least 40% of gold jewellery purchases are through the exchange of old jewellery or coins and bars bought for investment. Earlier, exchange accounted for 10% of purchases.

 Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller, said, “Gold prices have remained on the higher side for one and a half months and have passed the Rs 32,000 per 10g mark. People don’t want to buy at such a high price. Most buyers are therefore exchanging old gold jewellery that is worn out for new pieces or are exchanging bars and coins they had bought to make fresh purchases.”
 
 Gold prices were at Rs 32,400 per 10g including 3% goods and services tax (GST) on Monday. “The international price of gold has risen over the last two months, due to the geopolitical situation with the China-US trade war and escalating tensions between US and Syria around the first half of April. The rupee has also depreciated from 63 to 67 against the dollar, due to which gold prices have further risen. This has dampened the spirits of consumers and buyers,” said  , secretary of the  .
 
 Acharya pointed out that the recent shortage of cash is also a factor for more gold exchanges. “Rural areas were the worst hit by the cash shortage and without savings, most of these people exchanged old gold instead of buying it at a higher price,” he explained.
 
 Shanti Patel, president of the Gems and  , said, “Exchange of old gold instead of fresh purchases are for jewellery purchases and wedding purchases. 
 
 Most wedding jewellery purchases are made through exchange of old gold bars and coins, while routine purchases such as rings, chains or bangles are upgrades of old jewellery pieces.”
