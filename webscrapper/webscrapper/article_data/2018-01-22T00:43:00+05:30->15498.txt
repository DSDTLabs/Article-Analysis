Tirupur: Even as the state commercial tax department is gearing up to create awareness and provide training on e-way bill, the knitwear industry in Tirupur has urged the central government not to implement the system.  “The e-way bill system would strangulate small manufacturers. The system would give the commercial tax department more ‘teeth’ to keep those manufacturers in their clutches,” said Babuji, general secretary of collar work and hosiery small Industries Association. Manufacturers should generate an e-way bill if they want to transport goods worth over Rs 50,000 and beyond 10km inside the state, as well as it is mandatory for goods of any value to be transported to other state. While about ten states have already implemented the system, the preparation works are going on in Tamil Nadu. The Union government has set February 1 as the deadline to implement the system across the country. “To manufacture knitwear, it would take at least 17 processes to complete the products. Unless a company has all those setups under one roof, it has to transport the goods other places to complete the production,” said S Govindappan, vice-president of South India Hosiery Manufacturers Association (SIHMA). “In hosiery products, the large manufacturers depend on cottage industries, which might be dispersed even beyond 30-40km, to complete the production,” he added.  “The thumb rule of ‘10km limit’ would be unfavourable for the industry. And most of times the cottage industries would transport the goods even if half of the assigned quantity is ready. In such circumstances, e-way bill rules could not be followed,” said Govindappan.
