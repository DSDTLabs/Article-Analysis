 The survey — said to be the largest in the country — assessed the knowledge of 2.2 million students from 1.1lakh schools across 700 districts from all states and Union territories. The tools used were multiple-test booklets with 45 questions for students of Classes 3 and 5, and 60 questions for Class 8. Apart from mathematics, students were tested on language, environmental sciences, sciences and social sciences. The data was compiled subject-wise.
 
  
 While Class 8 students in Thiruvananthapuram recorded a pass percentage of 56.37 in mathematics, boys secured a higher pass mark — 58.18 — while girls secured 53.99 in the subject. Bengaluru North came in third with 35.19%, followed by Hyderabad and Chennai (33.48% and 31.19%, respectively).
 
 While students in Bengaluru South scored above those from the north of the city, government school students in the north secured a higher pass percentage — 36.83 — than aided school students (33.8%). In Bengaluru South too, students of government schools did better (46.83%) compared to those in aided schools (39.32%).
 
 In two of the four cities in the south of the country, girl students’ performance has dropped. While Bengaluru North recorded a female pass percentage of 34.53%, the pass percentage for male students was 36.21%.
 
 Hyderabad showed a similar trend where 32.53% girls in Hyderabad fared well in the subject compared to 35.16% boys. In Thiruvananthapuram, the gap was wider as girls secured 53.99% pass rate compared to 58.18% among boys.
