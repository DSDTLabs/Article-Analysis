HYDERABAD: With smoke filling their flats, panic-stricken residents of   (opposite  ) at   rushed out of their dwellings to save their lives after a fire engulfed their building in the early hours of Wednesday. Some ran to the terrace, while others rushed on to the road in front of the building. However, there was no loss of life in the blaze, which was doused by fire fighters after a three-an-half-hour exercise.

 Around 30 people were rescued from the terrace using a skylift and more than 20 people struggled their way out through the stair case.
 
  
  
 
 “We suspect a short circuit in one of the shops on the ground floor may have triggered the fire in the building (G+5), which soon spread to the second floor. There was no loss of life. We are assessing the property damaged,” district fire officer (Hyderabad) M   said.
 
 “We received an alert around 3am and reached the spot within 15 minutes. Firefighters started their operations around 3:30am and we extinguished it by 7am,” he added.
 
 In the five-storied building, business establishments and shops occupy the first two floors, while families stay on the remaining floors. When TOI visited the place on Wednesday morning, it was found that the building, where 10 families reside, had no fire safety measures in place.
 
 “Around 2:00am, my wife sensed something burning, but we did not take it seriously. When the smell increased, I opened the window. And, within a few minutes, the house was filled with smoke. I could barely see my family members,” said  , who rushed to the terrace from his third floor flat.
 
 When people started calling firemen, they were told to cover their face with a wet cloth and reach the terrace. After the accident, most occupants locked their homes and made alternate arrangements as electricity and water supply were yet to be restored. “The firefighters have asked us not to switch on the gas. I hope things will back to normal soon,” T Laxmi, another resident, said.
