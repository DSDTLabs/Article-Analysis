LUCKNOW: Along with attracting big businesses, the Investors’ Summit will also be an opportunity of ‘ghar wapsi’ for UP’s entrepreneurs.
 
 The government will pitch in for the return of UP’s entrepreneurs who have moved to other states in pursuit of better and more lucrative industrial ventures.
 
 
  
 
 At a press conference in Lucknow on Monday, infrastructure and industrial development commissioner (IIDC)   said the government would urge such business owners to come and set up industrial units here and contribute in the development of their state.
 
 “The industrial environment in the state is conducive to entrepreneurs. The state government is devising policies which are suitable for entrepreneurs who, in turn, can put UP on a growth trajectory,” said Pandey.
 
 The IIDC’s observation on the state government seeking a ‘ghar wapsi’ of investors is seen as a follow-up of industries minister Satish Mahana’s claim that the upcoming Investors’ Summit would surpass investment proposals received during the   and   regimes in UP.
 
 Mahana had recently said that the proposals for industrial development received during the previous regimes never saw the light of the day.
 
 “At least I can’t remember, though I’ve been an   for more than 25 years,” the minister had remarked.
 
 Mahana had stated that the   government went to the same destinations like Mumbai and Agra where the Samajwadi Party government had organized investors’ summits but the response received from the investors this time was way better than in Akhilesh’s regime.
 
 “The BJP government held road shows in six cities in the run-up to the Investors’ Summit and we hope our efforts would change the game all together,” he had said.
 
 Mahana’s statement had come after SP chief   Yadav had questioned the BJP government’s claims of getting investments despite a poor law and order situation in the state.
