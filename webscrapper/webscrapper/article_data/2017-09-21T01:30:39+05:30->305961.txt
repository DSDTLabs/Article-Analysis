NEW DELHI: The rot in medical education has been laid bare, with the   and probe agencies looking into the role of sitting and retired judges of HCs in enabling private medical colleges admit students to   courses despite the apex court’s order to the contrary.

 Investigating agencies have also lodged an FIR against two IAS officers serving in Puducherry, former health secretary B R Babu and Narendra Kumar, who headed the committee looking after admissions to medical colleges, for allegedly denying admissions to deserving students and selling seats to others at “exorbitant” rates.
 
 The apex court is examining two judges of the Allahabad high court, Justices S N Shukla and  , for permitting a private medical college to admit students despite the apex court’s categorical order that no HC would allow any college to fill MBBS students for academic year 2017-18.
 
 Chief Justice Dipak Misra is learnt to have ordered the scrutiny after learning about an escalating probe by agencies into what could have led   and Kumar of the Lucknow bench of   to pass the unusual order. The CJI is understood to be contemplating “structured stringent action” against erring judges if the “unbelievable charges” were found prima facie true.
 
 The malaise in medical education was also brought out starkly on Wednesday when CBI registered a corruption case against a retired Orissa HC judge, Ishrat Masroor Quddusi, and five others for allegedly conspiring to settle a   order debarring a private medical college from MBBS admissions.
 
 Quddusi has been accused by the CBI of offering legal guidance to the promoters of the private medical college on how to get around the admission ban and even promising a favourable order from the apex court. Sources said CBI was also examining the possibility of promoters of private medical colleges enlisting him and another retired HC judge to get around the order restraining them from admitting students to the MBBS course.
