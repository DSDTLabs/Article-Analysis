NEW DELHI: Just under half the posts in hospitals and dispensaries run by Delhi government and the municipal corporations are lying vacant.   claimed on Wednesday that data accessed through RTI showed that municipal hospitals had a shortfall of 40% of   and 45% of paramedical staff. 

 In the government-run hospitals and dispensaries, while the maximum vacancies were for academic positions (68%) and administrative positions (41%), there still was a gaping 21% vacancy for doctors and 31% for paramedical staff.
 
 Milind Mhakse, project director of Praja Foundation, explained that the staff shortage was calculated by subtracting the available positions from the sanctioned positions in the health units. In cases of abolished positions, the sanctioned positions, excluding the number of abolished positions, were considered.
 
 Praja also claimed that 85% of Delhi’s population did   have medical insurance, though patients spend over Rs 50,000 on treatment, transport and other needs even in government hospitals like AIIMS. “Unskilled workers — the lowest socio-economic category – spend 11.5% of their annual family income on hospital or medical costs,” the study claimed. “Workers serving in executive positions spend 10.7% of their family income on healthcare.”
 
 The study, published in the latest issue of  , said, “Among the reasons for rising costs of treatment is that consumables such as medicines are often not available and need to be purchased. Due to long waiting time for diagnostic investigations, patients often need to or prefer to get these tests done at private diagnostic centres. There is also a tendency to over-investigate patients and practise ‘defensive’ medicine.”
 
 Dr Anoop Saraya, study leader, told TOI that healthcare was sometimes beyond the means of not only the poor, but also the middle and upper classes.  , a teacher in the   at JNU, said expenditure on public health needed to be boosted.
