BENGALURU: Unlike most girls her age,   goes beyond dressing up dolls and playing house -it lies in her happy little world of chess. Learning complex moves and lapping up chess notations comes easy for the soft-spoken eight-yearold Mandya girl, who, on Monday clinched her second successive Under-8 gold medal at the   in New Delhi.

 Adding to Karnataka's kitty was Kodagu's Ananya Suresh, who bagged the   in the U-18 category. Having won the 2016 Commonwealth U-8 gold in   at Kalutara in Sri Lanka, Shefali was gung ho for a glorious double. The young Woman Candidate Master lived up to her billing, notching up six wins and losing only once to emerge triumphant with six points in the seven-round encounter. I'm happy I could win another gold medal for India. My hard work has paid off. It's a great honour and I want to keep winning,â€œ said Shefali, the defending national U-7 champion. It's the third successive year Shefali has won an international medal, starting with the U-7 silver medal at the Asian School Championships in Singapore in 2015. One of the top-ranked chess prodigies in India, Shefali's success story is a testimony to the growing popularity of chess in Karnataka, especially among young children.
 
 Her love for chess began when she was three, watching her brother play. The young Magnus Carlsen fan, coached by Jayaram, developed an instant attachment to the sport, and now dedicates 5-6 hours a day to train on her laptop. Finding a balance with academics is no bother for the Class 4 student, who is among the top performers at Santhome Public School in Mandya.
