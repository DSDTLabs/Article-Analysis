RAJKOT: Despite three years since the central government’s advisory to all states, the Gujarat government has done precious little to make Right to Information ( ) system online. 

 In a reply to activist Shailendrasinh Jadeja’s query, the central government has said that an advisory was issued to all the states way back in 2013 to launch RTI web portal.
 
 Jadeja has been campaigning to make statewide digital platform to accept RTI applications and accept online payments to make the system more transparent at a time when the Modi government is pushing hard for ‘Digital India’. 
 
 He had written to the union department of personnel and training last month, which then sent a copy of the letter which was issued to all state governments to launch RTI online web portal. 
 
 The web portal has been designed by   (NIC) that has also requested the states to provide technical support such as software and source code for those who desire to replicate the web portal for online filling of RTI applications at state level. The payment gateway for RTI online web portal has been provided by the  ,’’ DOPT’s letter states.
 
 The DOPT also mentioned that no reference has been received from Gujarat in respect of online RTI portal.
 
 “It seems that PM’s own state deprives citizen who seek more transparent governance. Otherwise, there is no reason to adopt this easier and environment friendly practice,’’ the RTI activist added.
 
 Jadeja has been fighting against issues of municipal solid waste and its pollution in Rajkot by using RTI.
 
 “Our demand is that all government departments accept applications under RTI Act online, they accept payments online and provide details online (in electronic form) sought under RTI Act’’ he added.
