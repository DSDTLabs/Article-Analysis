BENGALURU:   and his daughter,  , could   in the assembly elections in the state. The Election Commission is likely to appoint the father-daughter duo as ‘state icons’ to draw more people out to vote.

 “We will finazalise the names by the weekend after we get written confirmation,” said Sanjiv Kumar, chief electoral officer.
 
 In the previous assembly polls in 2013, Karnataka recorded the second highest voter turnout in 35 years with a polling percentage of 71.3. “We aim to take it above 75% this time and our focus will be on Bengaluru where the voting percentage last time stood at 59%,” an official said.
 
 Though cricketer Rahul Dravid’s name was doing rounds, the EC is keen on the Padukones as they could be inspirational mascots for male and female voters. Sources said Dravid turned down the EC’s offer due to his hectic schedule over the next two months , what with the IPL looming.
 
 “The Padukones have orally agreed to be our mascot, but we are awaiting confirmation in writing. It is for the first time that there will be national icons like the Padukones to boost voter participation for an assembly poll,” an official said.
 
 The Padukones are expected to ‘lead’ a league of other prominent ‘state icons’ including Javagal Srinath (cricketer), Yogaraj Bhat (filmmaker) Sudeep, Yash, Rashmika Mandanna and Shruthi Hariharan (actors) among others.
 
 EC officials said these icons will reach out to people through programmes such as systematic voter education and electoral participation (SVEEP), which aims at increasing voter turnout as also quality of electoral participation in terms of informed and ethical voting. The poll ambassadors will be a part of print and electronic advertisements and will also participate in roadshows.
 
 “There are over 16 lakh first-time voters,” an official said. “Deepika has a special appeal among youth and she can make a difference.”
