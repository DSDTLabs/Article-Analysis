Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday attacked Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for welcoming the Supreme Court decision that gives two-month to Punjab and Haryana to solve the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal dispute.

 “If Amarinder was sincere about protecting the rights of Punjab, he should immediately and unequivocally declare that there would be no SYL and no water sharing with Haryana. Instead of this, he is welcoming the Supreme Court decision to solve the issue amicably,” said the former deputy chief minister. 
 
 His statement came even as SAD’s traditional ally in Haryana INLD had a day ago carried protests outside parts of Punjab over SYL row. He did not comment on the protests led by INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala.
 
 “A wrong message has been sent out to Punjabis by the chief minister by welcoming the Supreme Court order and stating that he is ready to start negotiations with Haryana on this issue. Nothing can be more absurd than this. What will he negotiate? Does he want to sell out the interests of Punjab,” he asked.
 
 The Congress had a history of betraying Punjabis, Sukhbir added.
