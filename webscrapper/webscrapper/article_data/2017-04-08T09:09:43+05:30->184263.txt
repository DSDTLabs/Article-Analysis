PANAJI: The state government is likely to amend the Agriculture   Act, 1964, within a month, transferring tenancy cases back to the office of the mamlatdar from the court of civil judge senior division. Most of the   candidates, who lost the 2017 assembly polls, blamed the 2014 amendment of the law that saw JMFCs hearing tenancy cases. tnn

 Gomantak Bhandari Samaj (GBS) general secretary   said chief minister  , on Friday, assured a delegation of theirs of coming out with a solution to the tenancy issue within a month. 
 
 The government is examining its earlier amendment before reverting it, a senior government official said and added that the government is contemplating on fixing a time period within which the mamlatdar will have to conclude hearings in a tenancy case or else the matter would transferred to the civil court.
 
 “Nothing has been finalized as yet. The chief minister will take the final decision,” the officer said.
 
 Revenue minister Rohan Khaunte told reporters that subsequently two of the three clauses of the 2014 amendment had been withdrawn, including the sunset clause that gave tenants three years from September 25, 2014, to file an application declaring their tenancy rights.
 
 “Now all that is left to do is transfer the cases back to the mamlatdar’s office. But, before this is done, we have to ensure that the cases do not get stuck at the mamlatdar’s office, and that hearings begin within 15 days of the transfers being effected,” Khaunte added, further maintaining that the tenancy issue would be part of the common minimum program.
 
 GBS made a representation to the CM demanding that Section 19 of the 2014 amendment to the Agriculture Tenancy Act be revoked, stating that the community has been affected by it.
