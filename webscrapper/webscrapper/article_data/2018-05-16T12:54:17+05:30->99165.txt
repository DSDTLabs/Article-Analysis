PANAJI:   International Cooperation Agency ( ) has clarified that it is only a funding agency and the works funded by it are executed by the central and state agencies in the country.

 As far as Goa is concerned, senior representative of JICA, Takayoshi  , in a statement, said that   supply and sewerage projects in Goa are being executed by the PWD. A special cell is created in the PWD for the purpose. There is a misconception that some works are being implemented by JICA and even references are made in newspaper reports.
 
 The report published in TOI in its edition dated May 13, 2018 under the title ‘Quepem citizens fume over dug-up road, want it restored’, wrongly indicated that JICA was an executing agency.
 
 “JICA is an incorporated administrative institution under the government of Japan, extending assistance in the form of concessional loans, grants and technical cooperation to projects that build social and economic infrastructure in emerging countries,” said the statement.
