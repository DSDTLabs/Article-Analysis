VADODARA: The   (VMC) administration is set to present its draft budget to the standing committee of the civic body on Wednesday. The cash-strapped civic body may look to hike taxes or  .

 The civic body has been off late struggling with its finances. The revenue department of VMC has had to go on an offensive like never before in the recent past to collect pending taxes to ensure that the finances of the civic body. The civic body also came up with an interest rebate scheme on pending taxes to recover them.
 
 With assembly polls over and the next elections scheduled only in 2019, the annual budget for the year 2018-19 is expected with hike in taxes and charges. Tax hikes in the budgets seem to be dependent on the poll schedules. In years preceding the polls, the tax hikes are either negligible or not imposed at all. The VMC budgets for the years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 have shied away from major tax hikes due to parliament, civic or assembly polls.
 
 The standing committee of the civic body is expected to begin discussions on the budget and clear it in the next month. The general board of the VMC will then take up the budget discussions and clear the budget.
 
 The recent budget presented by the   (AMC) has, however, added an interesting angle to the entire process. AMC stayed away from any tax hikes and now the VMC will be under pressure as it may not want to be seen doing otherwise. Even if hikes are proposed, these are significantly reduced or struck down by the standing committee.
 
 In 2013-14 budget, the civic body had hiked the property tax for residential properties from Rs 11 per square meter to Rs 16 pre square meter. For commercial properties this was raised from Rs 26 per square meter to Rs 30 per square meter. There have been no significant hikes after this.
