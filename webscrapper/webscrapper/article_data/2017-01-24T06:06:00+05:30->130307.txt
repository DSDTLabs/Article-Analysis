Gadchiroli: The Maharashtra industrial development corporation ( ), Gadchiroli, is set to acquire land to establish a processing plant for minerals (iron ore) extracted from Surjagarh hillocks, which have been leased to Lloyds Metals for mining.

 The decision was taken following a steady rise in protest from various social groups and outfits, including political leaders, who have said that the mining project is a mean to drain the district of its rich natural resources.
 
 The project, as per the dissenting groups, would deprive the native tribal population of their rights on the forest and its produce, apart from devastating their religious sentiments as the hillocks were manifestation of their chief deity ‘Thakur dev’.
 
 District collector ASR Naik said Lloyds group has already sent a request letter to the MIDC requesting it to acquire the land for the processing plant after the proposal in this regard was approved by their board of directors during last week’s meeting.
 
 “In the next coordination meeting to set up a plan of action, MIDC officials would also be asked to remain present. Once MIDC gives a positive nod, the district administration will immediately start the land acquisition process, which we plan to initiate by February-end,” he said. “MIDC and district administration would have to first zero down on a possible area which can be acquired for the purpose as the availability,” said the collector. 
 
 Naik also said the decision to utilize the district minerals fund would also be taken shortly. “The creation of security provisions and setting up of the plant are the two areas of our priorities,” he said.
