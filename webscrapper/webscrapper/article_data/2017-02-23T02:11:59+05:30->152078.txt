NEW DELHI: Children homes in the city came under the high court’s scanner on Wednesday that has ordered a   on their condition and how children are kept in them.

 Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva deputed a senior advocate as  , who would visit the homes registered with Delhi government to find out the conditions prevailing and also to speak to the children kept in these facilities.
 
 HC’s decision to intervene came after it learnt of an alleged sexual assault by a 16-year-old boy on an 11-year-old child in one of the homes. In 2016,   had directed women and child development department to transfer children from Prem Dham Ashram in Najafgarh, where they were kept in “deplorable” conditions, to an alternative home.
 
 Appearing for the government, advocate Prabhsahay Kaur assured the court that a detailed survey of all childcare homes registered with the government would be carried out and a status   submitted to the court.
 
 However, the court said that it wanted an independent feedback and asked senior advocate Anup J Bhambani to inspect the homes.
 
 The Najafgarh ashram had earlier moved the HC claiming that Delhi government’s women and child welfare department was forcing it to hand over the inmates to the child welfare committee. Transfer of children in the middle of an academic session could be detrimental to their studies, owner of the home claimed, adding that the ashram had been taking care of their food and lodging.
 
 But when Justice Sachdeva saw photographs placed by the government, he termed it “very disturbing” as they showed “girls in semi condition in presence of boys.”
 
 HC said the allegations by the government and its child welfare committee was “fortified from the photographs shown.” It ordered the ashram to immediately hand over the custody of the children to the CWC, who would then transfer them to an appropriate childcare home.
