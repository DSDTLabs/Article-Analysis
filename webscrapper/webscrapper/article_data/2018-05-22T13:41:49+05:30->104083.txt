In the past few years, we have seen every kind of wacky beauty trends. Bird poop facial, squiggly eyebrows, nose hair extensions, you name it and we have seen everything already. But, just when we thought it can't get creepier anymore, the beauty world surprised us yet again. 

 
 
 
 
 The latest trend that has stunned is a new wacky  . Enter: Nails that look like teeth. Yes, you read that right! Now, you can make your digits look just like teeth, specifically the molars. If you think about it, the design seems pretty creative, but they look weird at the same time. 
 
 A Russian-based nail salon, Nail Sunny is behind this viral nail trend. This nail art starts like any acrylic  , then a brush is used to mould it into a tooth shape. For one of the nail, the artist even added a black nail polish to make it look like a cavity on the tooth design. 
 
 Here's a video on how they created this nail art:
 
  
  
 
 This is not the first time the salon has created something wacky like this. From cool 3D designs to bizarre designs, the nail artist has showcased every possible design on the nails. Here' a look of some of the cool and wacky designs from the past:
