For a soft, supple and glowing skin

 Motherhood can often leave you with no time to protect and pamper your skin and hair. Good news: To be on point with your beauty regimen, just swipe what you need from your baby’s bag of tricks. “Baby products are almost always formulated to be gentle and hypoallergenic. The plus point is they are often cheaper than their adult variants,” says beauty expert Priya Kapur. Borrow these from your baby...
 
 
  If you hate the sticky feeling post a body massage, use baby oil. Unlike olive, almond or sesame oils, baby oil seeps into your skin, leaving it supple and soft. 
 
 
 It is a cheap alternative to make-up wipes. On a hot summer’s day, use a wipe to keep your face fresh, clean and grime free. Massage a few drops of baby oil onto your face and then wipe off with wet wipes. Sensitive skin? Pick fragrance-free wipes.
 
 
  Sprinkle it on your scalp to fashion a home-style dry shampoo. But remember to take it easy, too much baby powder can give you faux grey hair. You can also apply a coat of lipstick, dab a bit of powder, and follow up with another coat. This will make the lipstick last longer. 
 
 
 Baby body wash is gentler on skin. Mild, with a more balanced pH, it’s very moisturising. Many come with vitamins and are paraben, colourant, and mineral oil-free.
 
 
  It’s thicker than adult body lotion and works fabulously on adult skin, especially dry heels, chafed skin and rashes.
 
 
 
 Avoid using the gentle baby shampoo. The pH formulation with higher acidity — for “no tears” — can leave your strands rough and dry.
 
 
  For an effective face wash, dilute body wash, mix a drop of baby oil and use a baby wipe to clean up.
