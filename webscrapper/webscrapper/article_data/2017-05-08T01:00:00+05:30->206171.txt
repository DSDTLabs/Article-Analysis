How often do we get a chance to mend a relationship which is on the verge of a break-up or meet strangers who help us start a new life? These were the questions addressed in the play  ,  ., which was performed recently at the Alumni Annual General Meet of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. Written and directed by  , the play had four short stories based on the things we often neglect in our lives. The relatable stories received an overwhelming response from the audience. The cast of the play included Nadira's son,  ,   and  , among others. 

 
 
 
 The four short stories were presented and weaved together by a sutradhar, played by  , who was a sales executive in the play. The first story, titled Friends, started with two boys giving an exam for a scholarship. It highlighted the disconnect between the two characters because of the difference in their economic status. The second story,  , had two strangers – a middle-aged woman and an old man – describe the hardships of old age. A husband-wife relationship, where the wife earns more than the husband was the theme of the third story, Painkiller. Aarya Babbar played a jealous husband who cannot see the efforts put in by his wife to save their marriage. The last story, Peele Gulab, was about an old couple, where the man returns to his wife after being ditched by his lover. The story unfolds as the man reminisces about his lover, and is not ready to accept that she left him. 
 
 
 
 After the play, Nadira told us, "This was the first time that we performed in IIT-D. It was really overwhelming. The response was great. When the play starts, you don’t know whether the people would like it or not, but the response was great here."
 Satish Chauhan, manager of the  , added, "All of us enjoyed the play thoroughly. These stories are around us, but we hardly pay any attention to them."
