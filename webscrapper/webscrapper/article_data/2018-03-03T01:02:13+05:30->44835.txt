Recently, the city police along with the city corporation began a drive to clear encroachments by traders on footpaths. While many streets around Meenakshi Amman temple, including Town Hall Road, Nethaji Road and Veli Street were cleared, pedestrians yearn for similar action throughout the city.

 Most of the footpaths along the city roads are encroached by traders and residential houses, making it hard for pedestrians. “The pathways on both sides of the entire stretch on   is encroached by traders, as if they own the pathways too. While some hotels spread out their shops at night, many shops have made concrete structures like steps,” said  , a resident of Munichalai. 
 
 K Sethuraman, treasurer of walkers club from the city, said that many roads are not friendly for pedestrians since they have been encroached by traders. “At many places the covers over the drainage is in a damaged state, which should be rectified,” he said. 
 
 S Kathirvel, a resident from  , said that officials should not restrict themselves to the few streets around the temple. “The same resolve should be applied to all parts of the city, to keep pavements free from encroachments,” he said. 
 
 Pedestrians are forced to use the carriageway as pathways are encroached. According to the traffic police, half the number of pedestrians deaths in the city took place when they were using the carriage way. 
 
 Madurai city corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar said that they have been clearing encroachments on pathways from one road to other. When they started a drive recently on busy commercial roads, they thought there would face opposition from the traders. But, they were stumped by cooperation from traders. 
 
 “Many have encroached since others too do it. When everything is being cleared without any prejudice, they extended their support,” he said.
