BHIWANDI: A   court on Wednesday directed   president   to appear before it on June 12 in connection with a defamation case filed against him by an RSS functionary Rajesh Kunte. 

 RSS functionary Kunte had filed a defamation case against Gandhi in 2014 after watching his speech in Bhiwandi where he accused the RSS of Mahatma Gandhi's murder.
 
 Rahul's lawyer Narayan Iyer said on Wednesday that the matter was adjourned to June 12 to record Rahul's plea. "We argued that the matter should not be decided summarily but through summons trial as it involves historical facts of Gandhi's assassination and so books and other relevant witnesses be produced for the trial." -Pradeep Gupta
