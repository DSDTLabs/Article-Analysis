NAVI MUMBAI: It’s tough to stop children playing with   during  . But   colours not only cause eye, skin and hair problems, they can affect throat and respiratory tract too. 

 Toxins like lead oxide (in black colour), mercury sulphide (in red) and aluminium bromide (in silver) and copper sulphate (in green) can be harmful for nostrils and respiratory tract, warn city paediatricians. 
 
 “Children often inhale or even ingest these colours while playing. Chemical colours can affect eyes, mouth and nostrils and can cause respiratory tract irritation,” said Dr Sagar Warankar, child pulmonologist from Sanjivanee childcare clinic in Panvel. This can lead to persistent sneezing, coughing with redness in eyes and the child falls sick, added Dr Warankar. 
 
 “For children with allergies or asthma, the micro dust and toxic chemicals in colours might trigger the allergic condition. The sudden changes in climate may worsen the condition,” said Dr Vijay Yewale, head of the paediatric department,  . “Bronchitis, cough, nasal irritation and allergies are some other conditions faced by the children during Holi.”
 
 Both paediatricians advise the use of organic colours. In case of complications, drinking plenty of fluids, gargling, eating homemade food and rest can help the condition.
