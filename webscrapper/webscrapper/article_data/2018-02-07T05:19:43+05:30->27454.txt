An unreleased song from rapper   (II) album "Too many chances" has surfaced online.

 The approximately-four-minute track doesn't have the trap vibes that   usually carries on his tracks. Instead, it features a simple-driven instrumental. While the song appears to be missing the second verse, it is still worth listening to.
 
 It is still unknown, though, whether the track will be included on the rapper's highly-anticipated album "Astroworld", which is expected to be released sometime this year. He's been teasing the album since 2016, but he previously said he didn't know "what's going to be on it yet." 
 
 The leak of 'Too many chances' comes just a day after Scott and his girlfriend   announced that they welcomed their first child.
