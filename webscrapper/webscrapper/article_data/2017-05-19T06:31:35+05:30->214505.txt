AGARTALA: The city came to a standstill in the 24-hour general strike called by   on Thursday even as it evoked a mixed response across the state. 

 The bandh was called to press for a 12-point charter of demands, including the return of deposits in several Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).   president Birajit Sinha said the strike was called with the primary motives of demanding a CBI probe into NBFC scams, provisions for unemployed allowance, waiver for agricultural loans and restoration of law and order.
 
 "Congress will continue the agitation till its demands are met," Sinha said, adding that the strike was successful but the ruling Left Front "instigated" people in certain areas.

 The city did not witness many pickets, but some picketing was reported from North Tripura. About 500 picketers were arrested across the state but there was no report of any untoward incident. 
 
 Vehicle stayed off the roads and most major markets were shut. Top officials of the administration did attend office but the functioning of government offices was disrupted as most employees could not turn up. Business establishments and academic institutions were closed. Hospitals recorded thin attendance. The secretariat, too, functioned with a skeletal staff.
