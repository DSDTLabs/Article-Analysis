VIZAG: A classy 93 by   followed by a spirited fightback by the spinners powered Tamil Nadu to the final of the   on Monday. Vijay Shankar & Co. humbled India Blue by 73 runs in a must-win game at the Dr YSR ACAVDCA Stadium to set up a final date with India Red on Wednesday. 

 Though the margin of victory looks huge, the win didn't come that easily for Tamil Nadu. Chasing 304, India Blue were in the game right till the 40th over with opener   scoring a brilliant 97 (114 balls, 6x4s, 3x6s). The departure of opener   (12) and No 3   (21) didn't force Mandeep to curb his natural instincts. He kept taking his chances at regular intervals and it paid off.
 
 Krunal Pandya (36), who was promoted to No 4 ahead of   (14) and the hard-hitting Rishabh Pant (6), used the long handle to good effect before miscuing one to deep mid-wicket off leggie M Ashwin (1 43) leaving Blue at 1383 in 24.4 overs.
 
 Vijay triggered Blue's batting collapse running Tiwary out with a superb effort at close on the off-side.
