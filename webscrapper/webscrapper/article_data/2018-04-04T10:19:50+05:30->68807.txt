Gold Coast: The lawn bowls players would be some of the most unsung in the Indian contingent here, walking alongside a handful of global stars, but the 10-member squad, including five women, is going into the Games fancying their chances after getting close to the podium in Glasgow four years ago.

 
 
 
 
 Leading the Indian charge, along with Asian champion Dinesh Kumar, would be young   — one of the many players from the tribal belt whose father is employed by the Jharkhand bowls federation as a security guard of the greens in Ranchi. “The association pays Roshan Lakra a monthly salary of Rs 5,000. We have also provided him a room at the greens where he lives with his family,” India’s lawn bowls coach Madhukanth Pathak told TOI here.
 
 
 
 
 
 “Alok is the most promising player in the squad,” the coach said about the youngster who won the Asian Boys title in New Delhi last year. He also played in the U-25 World Cup in   in February this year.
 
 “We have trained well and are confident of winning a medal this time,” Lakra said.
 
 
 
 
 Asked about the lack of popularity of lawn bowls in India, the youngster said: “I couldn’t even make my friends understand what sport I play.”
 
 “Eight of the 10 players are from the tribal belt in Jharkhand. Among their drawbacks are the lack of knowledge of English and mental strength. It cost us a medal in Glasgow   as they were easily intimidated by their opponents,” Pathak recalled.
 
 But in Gold Coast, the Indians are getting ready to mount a serious challenge after preparing for more than two months here.
