TRICHY: The city recorded an average 76mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending Thursday morning but at least 90 per cent of it had poured down in an hour on Wednesday evening adding chaos to the existing traffic woes. With the city experiencing a sudden downpour for the second straight day on Thursday evening, residents have been bearing the brunt of rainwater stagnation on Melapudur subway. 

 The Melapudur underpass serves as a crucial link for residents of Palakkarai and neighbourhoods around   to reach the railway station and central bus stand. However, the flooding of the subway owing to the poor draining of rainwater has been forcing vehicles to take a detour. When the water stagnates in the underpass, vehicles approaching Prabhat junction are rerouted via   and Heber road while those going towards   road and Bharathiyar Salai from Gandhi Market would take the Goods Shed road. Despite knowing that the subway was prone to water stagnation, the absence of appropriate diversion mechanism resulted in two city buses getting stranded in a pool of water on Wednesday. “There are no caution boards at the entrance of the subway. Similarly, a safe level mark to convey that the subway is unsafe to pursue during heavy rainfall is absent,” D  , a resident of  , said.
 
 Though a temporary lockdown of the underpass occurs every monsoon, local people called for a permanent mechanism to prevent flooding of the subway. Since city buses getting stranded on the subway as it happened on Thursday had becoming a routine affair, traffic police were also blamed for not taking any precautionary measure to stop vehicles from accessing the underpass. 
 
 When contacted, official sources with state highways department said that stagnating water was periodically drained out with the help of motor pumpset. However, official sources claimed that warning boards conveying alerts about the waterlogged condition of the underpass could be placed only by the traffic police.
