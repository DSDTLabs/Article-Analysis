The Pradesh has given its Uttar to poll speculation, and it’s a thumping, unexpected TsuNaMo in favour of the BJP. The face of the UP   campaign, PM  , might often have been called 'divisive', but there was little divide among the state's imports in Mumbai – UP actors and directors in films and TV, who spoke to us after the election results yesterday, were all sanguine about the results. For an election that had little star power on the ground during campaigning, film and TV stars from the state seemed to be nearly unanimous in their opinion. The opposition and disappointment, in fact, came from other quarters of the industry, with the  's loss in   being the other talking point.
