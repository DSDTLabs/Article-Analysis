NEW DELHI: The   has set aside a   ( ) order denying certification to ‘Games of Ayodhya’, a film based on the love story of a press reporter in the backdrop of   demolition in   in 1994.

 The film, which was denied a certificate by Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) on grounds that the subject of the temple-mosque dispute was provocative, had defamed individuals, and had the potential to stoke communal passions, was set aside by the FCAT bench on grounds that the film dealt with a subject central to many films already. The tribunal also directed CBFC to issue a U/A certificate to the film.
 
 In its September 26 order, FCAT ruled in favour of a certificate being granted to ‘Games of Ayodhya’ after it observed that CBFC had rejected the film summarily, and without suggesting any cuts or changes to film’s director, Sunil Singh. The director also alleged that CBFC has incorrectly claimed that the content of the film could stoke communal tensions. The CBFC, while it was asked to submit its opinion and appear before the tribunal, chose only to send its written reply to the tribunal.
 
 In the film, Singh, who also acts in the film, plays a middleaged journalist who narrates the story of his love affair, when he was 27, with a Muslim girl in Ayodhya, in the backdrop of the Babri Masjid demoliton. The filmmaker says his film focuses on the sins he committed as a young reporter; actions that led to riots between Hindus and Muslims.
 
 In its final order, the FCAT said, “The film is an attempt by the producer to present different perspectives. Producer has attempted by resorting to a flashback and a discussion representing clergy, research scholars, librarians and others knowledgeable about the history of Masjid Mandir dispute to represent various facets which may not be fully known based on their research and study.”
