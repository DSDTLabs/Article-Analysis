JAIPUR/ALWAR: An 18-year-old Dalit youth was allegedly tied and burnt to death in Bhiwadi,  . His body was recovered on Tuesday from near a new set of flats at Sector 3, Bhiwadi. This comes just four days after 16-year-old Neeraj Jatav was allegedly   by a mob after a dispute over the songs that were being played during Holi festivities. It also created panic among the locals as the deceased was close friend of the youth Neeraj who was kiled during Holi festivities. 

 Additional SP   was at the spot. A large crowd had gathered outside the hospital while the body was being examined. Once the body was identified as that of 18-year-old Ajay Jatav, some people said there may be a connection to the murder of four days ago as the two boys were friends. 
 
 Solanki said an FIR is being registered and the possibility of the two murders being connected will also be explored. “It was known that he was close to Neeraj. Whether this murder is linked with Neeraj’s murder is yet to be ascertained,” said a senior officer.
