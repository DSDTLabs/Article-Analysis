 Life has become busy with the pressure of tighter and tighter deadlines. The stress has brought   into the lives of many people but few dare to talk about it. It is evident from the newspaper reports of suicides. The burden of this disease mounts over time. It doesn’t spread by contact but depression is as serious as cancer, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, lung disease, cataract, and hearing loss.
 
 Its fallout includes broken families, break-ups, fights with friends, family discord, unhealthy competition, and failing health. The warning signs are frequent irritability, continuous sadness and hopelessness, social withdrawal, increased sensitivity to rejection, changes in appetite and sleep, vocal outbursts, and hysteric crying. A major cause of depression is social isolation—people have no time to be social.
 
 
 The pressure of work has turned mankind into slaves. Offices have stopped setting limit to work. It’s the new work culture that’s pushing workers into a life of antidepressants, vitriol, drugs, and alcohol. The solution lies in going back to old family values, talking and sharing more, being of help to someone.
 
 Be more social and cultivate compassion. The government should include a chapter on depression in school curriculum and teachers should explain it seriously. Early detection of signs can make way for timely action to save a depressed life.
 
 Counselling can help. But at the same time, please try to understand that when we talk about depression, it is completely different from normal blues and sadness. Yes talking to our loved ones help. It does indeed. However not many would understand what you are going through. They would lend a listening ear most of the times but eventually end up saying: “Stop thinking about it, get over your past.”
