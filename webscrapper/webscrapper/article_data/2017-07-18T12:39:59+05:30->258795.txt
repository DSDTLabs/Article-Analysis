NAGPUR: Passengers travelling in city buses on more than half a dozen routes were left stranded on Sunday as many buses failed to ply on time due to non-availability of conductors. The problem started after certain   who were reluctant to shift from one agency, Unity, to the newly appointed   (SIS) did not show up for work.

 Chandra Prakash Tiwari, head of Delhi Integrated Multimodal Transit System (DIMTS), agency monitoring the city bus service, told TOI, “Some bus routes were cancelled and some were severely affected as most conductors failed to report on duty due to shifting of conductors from Unity to SIS.”
 
 When asked how SIS will handle the situation, Tiwari said, “SIS has been hired to reduce problems faced by city transport service. Since the conductors did not report on duty, we couldn’t do anything in this regard.”
 
 The affected routes included Sitabuldi to Besa, Godhni, Hingna, Bahadur Phata, Gorewada and others . 
 
 Ranglal Tiwari, city representative, Maharashtra General Kamgar Union, stated that conductors did not report on duty because the SIS is making unjustified demands like entering into an agreement, which the conductors do not want to sign. “Moreover, SIS is demanding Rs12,000 from each conductor as security deposit, which is unfair. We have approached higher authorities to intervene in the matter,” he said. 
 
 Ranglal further said that the agencies managing conductors call them in the early hours but fail to give them any work due to which their work schedule has reduced to just 15-18 days per month. He added that conductors have lost faith in DIMTS as well as   due to such unfair practices.
 
 TOI spoke to some commuters who expressed their anger.  , a regular commuter to Godhani said, “Bus services have gone from bad to worse. I was waiting for almost an hour but failed to board my bus.” 
 
 Aditi Gawande, who travels to Besa, said, “I do not understand how the bus service functions. Commuters are the main sufferers.”
