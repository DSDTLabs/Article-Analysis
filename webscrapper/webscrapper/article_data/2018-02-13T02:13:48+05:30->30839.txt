NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has come to the   of a husband whose wife was being forced to live in a   by police because her family objected to the  .

 A bench of Justices S Muralidhar and I S Mehta last month directed police to immediately re-unite the woman, Kavita, with her husband Kayum after it found that she was a major and wanted to live with him. “Inexplicably Kavita was lodged in a women’s hostel run by Snehalaya and was there since December 19, 2017. With Kavita — an adult — having clearly stated that she married the petitioner of her own free will and having expressed her desire to return to him, police should not have kept her in a home for destitute women,” the bench observed while directing her release.
 
 The court also took on record the fact that Kayum had already been granted anticipatory bail in the case lodged by Kavita’s parents accusing him of kidnapping her. The family had even claimed in its complaint that she was already married before and the union with Kayum was illegal, but the counsel for the husband, advocate Ramit Malhotra told the court that Kavita married Kayum as soon as she turned a major and any marriage before that was void.
 
 On the complaint by the family, the police at Khajuri Khas had registered an FIR against Kayum, though Kavita later made a PCR call reporting that she married him of her own will and was living with him at Loni.
 
 The court took into account that even in her statement recorded before the metropolitan magistrate under Section 164 CrPC, Kavita clearly stated that her family members were not happy with her marriage and there was a life threat from her family members. She sought protection from police.
