COIMBATORE: Cyber crime cell sleuths of the Coimbatore City Police have arrested a former manager of the IDBI Bank for swindling Rs 1.98 crore.

 M   of Idayarpalayam on Thadagam Road had cheated his neighbour, who got the money as share of ancestral property, police sources said. “He is a native of Thrissur in Kerala and formerly was a manager with the IDBI Bank in Coimbatore. In 2007, he was residing in a flat at Sivananda Colony where he befriended his neighbour N Krishnamurthy, a retired manager of South India Viscos industries at Sirmugai. Krishnamurthy had received Rs 1.98 crore after selling property belonging to his wife Subathra and sister-in-law Padmaja during 2007-08,” a police officer said.
 
 Krishnamurthy discussed about investing the money with his friend Sujan, who advised him to invest it in the mutual fund of the bank. “Krishnamurthy handed over the amount to him. Sujan promised that he would provide Rs 90,000 per month as interest for the investment and also gave Rs 36 lakh as interests to Krishnamurthy. Later, Krishnamurthy came to know that Sujan took away the money and also resigned from the bank,” the officer said.
 
 Krishnamurthy lodged a complaint with the city crime branch police in 2011. Police registered a   case against Sujan and his wife Ajmal Chummar for cheating Krishnamurthy.
 
 A few weeks ago, the case was handed over to cyber crime cell inspector  . She arrested Sujan on Friday evening and remanded him to judicial custody. 
 
 Police said Sujan had purchased property in Coimbatore and various places in Kerala. Police are planning to attach them. Meanwhile, they have formed a special team to nab Sujan’s wife.
