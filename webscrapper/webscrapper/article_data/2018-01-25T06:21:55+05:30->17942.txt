LUCKNOW:   has directed 27 associated colleges to update their complete information on their individual   within 24 hours. 

 Colleges failing to do so will face strict action. 
 
 On January 10, LU had issued a notice to 54 colleges which had failed to update the number of seats, courses offered, teacher profiles and other information on their website. 
 
 All defaulting colleges were asked to report to LU with their complete information and supportive documents for a review meeting on Wednesday.
 
 "Representatives from 49 colleges turned up for the meeting with complete information. In total, 27 colleges have updated their websites since January 10 while remaining 27 are still to do so," said LU spokesperson  .
 
 The five colleges which have not updated their websites and from where no representative turned up for the meeting have been served a show-cause notice. They have been asked to respond within two days or their affiliation will not be continued in the new academic session, he added.
 
  will put the future of around 1,000 students in jeopardy.
 
 Pandey said the university had set a deadline of November for all colleges to upload all information on the college website. The 27 defaulting colleges now risk action against them.
