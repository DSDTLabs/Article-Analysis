VIJAYAWADA: Student unions are furious with repeated incidents of question paper leakage and demanded a full-fledged probe into the latest fiasco. 

  secretary Nagireddy on Tuesday said that social studies paper was leak at   in Narsapur village in Kadapa. "When a journalist tried to take photos of the leaked question papers, the cops beat him up and took him into custody. We protest the police action and want justice for all the students in the state," added Nagireddy.
 
 "Why is it that all the paper leakages are happening in corporate schools alone? Is it a mere coincidence or are the school managements trying to ruin the students' lives by encouraging such practices at a young age?" questioned Noor Mohammed, state secretary of SFI.
 
 Both ABVP and SFI demanded that inisters   and P Narayana resign from their posts. "Since the allegations are made against Narayana School, Narayana should take moral responsibility and resign immediately," said Mohammad. ABVP members burnt the effigies of the two ministers at Kurnool demanding their resignation.
