The project ‘Heat Action’, involves identifying the adverse effects of heat on citizens and spreading awareness on how to prevent them.

 Sharing details about the project, Preeti Bhandari, a second-semester Masters in Public Health research student, said: “Many of them were unaware of how to keep themselves hydrated at peak hours with oral rehydrating solutions, buttermilk and lime water. We also told them to use moist towels around their neck or over their heads to help them keep cool.”
 
 The students also performed a skit at the government primary school in Indroda village, to make schoolchildren understand heat-related hazards.
