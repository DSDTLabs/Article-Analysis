SURAT: Surat   ( ) would construct a new road for entry into the city from   (NH)- 8. The seven metre wide and 6.6km-long road near Kamrej on one side of the canal from Valak to   on NH-8 near Vav would cost the exchequer Rs 7 crore. The stone laying ceremony was performed on Saturday for the road, which is expected to be completed by February 2018. 

 SUDA chief executive officer J B Patel said, “This will help reduce traffic at Kamrej junction and distance too by at least 2.5km for those wanting to enter Varachha from Mumbai side. They can take this road and directly reach Laskana near Swaminarayan Mission in Varachha.” 
 
 SUDA plans a similar road on the other side of the canal once this road is completed. This would benefit people living in villages lying in proximity to Surat city near Kamrej, Sarthana, Valak, Laskana, Pasodara, Vav, Nansad and Navagam. 
 
 At present, there is just one road to enter Surat from Kamrej junction. Large number of vehicles find it difficult to reach Surat city after reaching Kamrej junction in four hours from Ahmedabad from NH- 8. Light motor vehicles would be able to take up canal corridor roads from both sides to reach other parts of the city without getting caught in traffic chaos of Varachha.
