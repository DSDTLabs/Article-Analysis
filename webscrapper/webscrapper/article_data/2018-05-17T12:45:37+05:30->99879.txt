TRICHY: There has been a steep decline in the number of students scoring high marks in the Plus Two state board exams from   this year. So were the numbers in scoring centum in individual subjects.

 For the second year in a row, no rank lists were released based on marks by the   to avoid unnecessary pressure on students. With 90.92%, Trichy district stood at 15th position in the state in the Plus Two results declared on Wednesday. This is down three positions from last year when the pass percentage was 95.01. Out of the total 35,216 students who appeared for the   from 244 schools, 32,715 came out in flying colours.
 
 Only seven students have got A-grade by scoring more than 1,180 marks out of the total 1,200. Among the seven, only one male student has achieved this feat. This is much lower than last year when 44 students scored above 1,180 marks. Out of the total 44, 29 were girls and 15 were boys.
 
 Besides, a large number of students have scored below 700 this year. I-grade is the lowest in the grade tally (those who score below 700 marks). A total of 13,035 students have fallen in the category. Last year 8,150 students had scored less than 700 marks.
 
 Subject-wise centum too came down significantly this year with 402 students scoring full marks in individual subjects. Accountancy saw the highest number of centum this year with 155 students scoring centum out of the total 402. A total of 900 students scored centum last year out of which 265 were in commerce subject.
 
 There was a positive trend in the number of schools securing cent percent results this year. However, that is attributed to an increase in the number of schools this year. All the students who appeared for the board exams from 65 schools managed to pass this year against 63 schools last year but it was also attributed to an increase in the number of schools from 231 last year to 244 this year.
 
 While the number of government schools remains 85, a total 12 schools could manage to secure cent percent results against 14 last year.
 
 “The number of students scoring high marks in the board exams are more likely to come down in the coming years,” said a headmaster of a government school in Trichy while attributing it to the increase in the difficulty level of questions as a policy decision of the state government to improve quality.
 
 “There is a shift in focus from board exam score to NEET score, especially from last year. There were few questions in almost all the papers that the students found difficult which is the reason for the fall in the number of centum and high scorers,” said chief educational officer Trichy M Ramakrishnan.
