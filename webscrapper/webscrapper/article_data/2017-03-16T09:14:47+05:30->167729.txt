MUMBAI: Over 5,000 resident doctors in public hospitals across the state will go on a token ‘mass bunk’ on Friday to protest against the assault on a senior resident doctor by a patient’s relative in   government hospital last week.

 Meanwhile, 35-year-old orthopaedic resident Dr Rohan Mhamunkar, whose left eye suffered severe trauma during the assault, was admitted to intensive care unit in Jupiter Hospital in Thane on Wednesday. The bone of the left eye orbit has been fractured and could affect his optic nerve and vision. However, in a press release, Jupiter Hospital authorities said that Dr Mhamunkar didn’t want his clinical details to be revealed.
 
 On Wednesday, representatives of the Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) submitted letters to   about Friday’s mass bunking. “We want the government to come up with a permanent solution on the security issue at government hospitals, especially after the Dhule incident,” said   president Dr Yashowardhan Kabra. “We will keep away from routine as well as emergency work between 8am on Friday and 8am on Saturday,” he added.
 
 The   (IMA) will hold a protest rally at   opposite CST on Friday, said Dr Sagar Mundada, who heads the youth wing of the state IMA.
 
 The state government is, in the meantime, working towards restricting the number of people entering the casualty ward. “The state will increase the number of security personnel outside the casualty ward to prevent crowds from entering,” said Dr  , who heads the department of medical education and research. “The condition of the doctor involved in the Dhule incident is improving slowly,” added Dr Shingare.
