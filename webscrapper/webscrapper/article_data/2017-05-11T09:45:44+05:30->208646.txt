CHENNAI:   has been working as a lightman for more than 30 years, fixing lamps at the whims and fancies of film directors. But the man who shed light on the sets of more than  , including `Michael Madana Kama Rajan' and ` Apoorva Sahodarargal', is now going through a dark period.

 Carrying the heavy lightguns from one shooting site to the other for three decades made his backbone weak. Elumalai had to undergo an operation on his disc in 2015. As a cure, the doctors placed steel plates, but that did not help. He is unable to sit and do any job for more than two hours at a stretch.
 
 “We are prone to injures on our spine and knees due to the heavy load that we carry during the shoot. Lighting materials are heavy and they have to be carried by a single person only. We need to shift the lights according to the angle and location. It's that painful job which weakened my backbone,“ said Elumalai, who lives in a single-room house in K K Nagar. “Even when I sleep, I have to frequently get up and change my position,“ he laments.
 
 Although the 50-year-old has many friends in the  , he is hesitant to approach them for money and wonders how to meet his day-today expenses. The meagre salary that his son gets from a courier company is not enough to meet the expenses. “My operation cost two lakh rupees.It's a huge amount for a lightman like me. Our association gave me some money but there was no help from anyone other than that,“ he says.
