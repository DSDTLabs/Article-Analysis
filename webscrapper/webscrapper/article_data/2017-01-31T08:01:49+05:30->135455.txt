DHARAMSHALA: Following reports of cruelty to animals, especially stray cattle and dogs who get trapped in traps laid by poachers, in these columns of TOI on Sunday, police here invited certain animal activists for deliberations on the situation. The meeting concluded on a note of mutual cooperation to fight the menace.

 Joellen Anderson, an American animal activist, working here said that the outcome of the meeting was positive as the administration was taking keen interest in the matter. “It is for the first time that the administration has called us and has assured cooperation in this regard. Senior cops are keen on supporting us in fighting the menace,” she said.
 
 The police said that they had registered a case under Sections 11 of the   and 429, IPC, against unknown persons following some news about cruelty to animals published in the Times of India on January 29.
 
 Senior Superintendent of Police   said that they had come to know that illegal traps were causing merciless deaths of stray animals through TOI. “We will take appropriate action in this regard and animal activists have also been assured for the same,” he said.
 
 Usually after snowfall in higher reaches animals on high altitudes move to lower areas. This is inviting for poachers, who increase their activities. Sometimes, it also leads to merciless deaths of stray cattle in the region as they often get trapped in these. Animal activists claimed that there is a sharp rise in incidents, where stray cows, dogs and pigs can be seen in severe pain with bleeding wounds, especially during winter.
