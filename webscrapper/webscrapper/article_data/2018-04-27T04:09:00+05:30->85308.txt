Vadodara: Due to rising mercury levels, water resources have started depleting in urban areas. As a result, it is common to find civic bodies depending on water tankers. The water bodies in forest areas are also dry up leaving animals and birds to fend for themselves.

 However, the forest department of Chhota Udepur too, like the civic bodies, supplies water through water tankers in forest for animals and birds. Around 23 small-sized tanks are installed in the interiors of the district by the forest department, which are refilled at regular intervals.
 
 “Every year after Holi, the natural water bodies in forest areas start drying up due to rising temperature. The situation for animals becomes tough therefore they venture into human-populated area which may also lead to man-animal conflict,” said S K Puwar, deputy conservator of forest, Chhota Udepur. He added that the forest department therefore installed water tanks which are filled using tankers.
 
 The beat guards of the department are responsible to check the water level of these tanks. “When the beat guards find that the water in the tank has got over, we dispatch the tanker from our nursery or by fetching water from private wells locally. Mostly two tankers are used to fill these tanks,” Puwar said. Animals do use water from tanks, but many times the water gets over due to evaporation, Puwar said.
 
 The forest department has also created a mechanism where it is ensured that the water tanks are filled. The tanker driver or a supervisor has to take photo of the refilling process and forward it along with details of the time, date and place so that the department can have a record of it.
 
 Animals like sloth bear, panthers, jackal, hyena, fox, neelgai and monkeys rely on these water tanks during the peak summers.
