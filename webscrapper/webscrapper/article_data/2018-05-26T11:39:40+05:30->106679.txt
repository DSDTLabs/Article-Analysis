BATHINDA: Punjab finance minister   Singh Badal’s brother-in-law Jaijeet Singh Johal alias Jojo served a legal notice for damages of Rs 10 crore on   president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, her brother Bikram Singh Majithia and two others on Friday. Jojo alleged that they made baseless allegations of him collecting ‘goonda tax.’

 He has given them one week to either apologise or face criminal defamation. He said the Badals and Majithia would also be asked to compensate for losses, damages and litigation expenses that were separately and tentatively quantified at Rs 5 crore. Apart from these three, SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh   and a representative of a vernacular TV channel have also been asked to tender an unqualified apology, withdraw allegations and desist from making similar statements.
 
 Jojo also challenged Sukhbir to have a debate with him to make it clear who amassed ill-gotten money by misusing offices of power. Ever since the   came to power in March 2017, Sukhbir and Harsimrat have been accusing Jojo of collecting ‘goonda tax’ from transporters.
 
 Addressing the media on Friday, Jojo said, “False allegations were purposely levelled against me to spread vicious and vile propaganda to defame, humiliate and harass me and tarnish the image of Manpreet Badal, who is an upright man. These allegations were intended to lower my dignity and cause mental agony. Wild, baseless and unfounded accusations have adversely affected my reputation.”
 
 When contacted, SAD spokesperson Cheema said, “We never used his full name and described only ‘Jojo tax.’ Now he has accepted that he collected the tax. We are not scared of the legal notice for defamation. When we receive it, we will reply to it.”
