HYDERABAD: The TRS government's move to 'banish'   to the outskirts of the city continues to simmer even a month after police banned protests near  . On Sunday, Hyderabad police took 150 political activists into preventive custody at   while they were planning to stage a '2K Run' to protest against the move to shift Dharna Chowk from the centre of the city. 

 Though various political parties denounced the move, Telangana political   (JAC) along with Left parties joined the protest against moving   out of the city. A Dharna Chowk Preservation Committee has been formed to fight against the government's decision. The committee gave a call for '2k Run' from   to Indira Park for keeping the Dharna Chowk near Indira Park itself. 
 
 TJAC chairman M Kodanadaram said removal of Dharna Chowk "is undemocratic and denial of right to protest to the people". The Chikkadpally police took 150 political activists, including Professor Kodandaram, Tammineni Veerabhadram, Vimalakka, Sandhya and others while they were trying to participate in the run. "All the arrested persons were booked under section 151 (preventive arrest) of the CrPC and released later on a personal bond," Chikkadpally inspector M Sudarshan said. Police had banned protests at Dharna Chowk near Indira Park after an abortive bid by TJAC to hold a rally and meeting highlighting unemployment issue on February 22.
