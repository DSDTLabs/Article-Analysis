PUNE: The   bench here on Friday   against the government, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and other state authorities over an alleged attempt to   of the Mutha and the   in the Development Plan (DP) of Pune’s old city limits. 

 The state government, through the director of town planning department, recently released the DP and invited suggestions and objections. 
 
 Lawyer Asim Sarode, representing the applicants, told TOI, “The tribunal has asked representatives of these authorities to be present before it at the next hearing on May 25.” 
 
 Architect Sarang Yadvadkar and activist Vivek Velankar have claimed in their application that the alteration of the blue and the red floodlines towards the centre of the river would result in illegal conversion of the prohibitive zone (where no structure is allowed) into a restrictive zone (where buildings are allowed) and the restrictive zone into a regular commercial or residential zone. They claimed the move is aimed at legalising existing and future encroachments on riverbeds. 
 
 The applicants stated that they have moved the tribunal as a precautionary measure considering the anticipated actions of the respondent authorities. They have invoked Section 20 of the NGT Act which refers, among other things, to the application of the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principles. 
 
 Yadvadkar, a member of the state government’s expert committee that revised the Draft DP for Pune (Old limits), said, “The illegal conversion of zones is bound to endanger the lives of the people and cause enormous environmental, economical and   It will facilitate constructions in the present prohibitive zone, making them vulnerable to floods and would reduce the carrying capacity of the river drastically leading to more frequent and severe floods.”
 
 The office of the director of town planning, PMC, Khadakwasla irrigation division, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Maharashtra state biodiversity board and National Disaster Management Authority are respondents.
