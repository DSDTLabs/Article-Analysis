 The accident happened around 10 am when Kumar was on his way to the central excise commissionerate office in Sector 32 on his Bajaj Discover bike.
 
  “A sedan first hit the victim’s bike from behind and ran him over when he fell down. Then another white colour Swift Dzire hit his bike, but I am not sure whether that car also ran him over. All this happened within a few seconds and no one could note down the numbers of the two cars,” said Jyoti Jha, an eyewitness.
 
 Cops said the accident was so severe that Kumar’s head was separated from his torso. He was wearing a helmet. Kumar was identified on the basis of his official identity card.

He had been working in the excise department for the past 12 years, while his wife is also working in the ministry of defence as a clerical staff. We are in shock and don’t know how to tackle his wife and children now,” Pramod Kumar, brother of the victim, said.
 
 “It was a shattering sight when I reached the accident spot after cops informed us. We want strict action against the accused vehicle driver,” he added.
 
 On the complaint of Rakesh Kumar, another brother of the victim, an FIR has been registered against an unknown vehicle driver under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death due to negligence) of the IPC at DLF-II police station.
 
 “The driver of the vehicle that hit the victim sped away immediately after the accident. We have lodged an FIR and are trying to trace the vehicle driver. We have kept the body in mortuary and an autopsy will be conducted on Friday,” said ASI Devender Singh, the investigating officer.
