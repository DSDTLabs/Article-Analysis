PANAJI: Union Ayush minister   on Saturday said that the Goa government will file a writ petition before the   for restarting mining activities in the state, and if it doesn’t get relief, the Centre will pass an ordinance as a last resort to resolve the issue.

 Speaking to reporters on Saturday,   said, “We will first file a writ petition because as per the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, mining can operate in the state till 2037. If we don’t get relief from the court, then the last option is to come up with an ordinance and we have convinced the Centre over this issue.”
 
 Naik further said that the state and central governments are working speedily to resolve the mining issue. “We have held meetings. We want to take a decision fast. There won’t be mining activities over the next four months. That does not mean that we are slow in resolving the issue. Mining activities will resume before the onset of the next mining season,” Naik said.
 
 Naik further said that Goa will host an international conference on yoga in September at the Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium, Bambolim, in which 85 countries are likely to participate. “Land at Dhargalim, Pernem, will be handed over to the ministry next month for the setting up of a National Institute of Naturopathy and Research Centre. The foundation stone for an Ayush district hospital will also be laid next month,” he added.
 
 Naik further said that over the last four years, the Centre has sanctioned over Rs 30,000 crore for the state.
