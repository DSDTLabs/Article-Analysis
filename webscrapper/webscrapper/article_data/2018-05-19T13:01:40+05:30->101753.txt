JAIPUR: Chief minister   said the Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan (MJSA) has done unparalleled work in the field of   conservation and self-reliance in water in the parched villages of the state. She said the state, earlier known for its drought, had set an example not only for the country but also the world in effective water conservation. 

 The chief minister said, "The techniques of the MJSA are being adopted by the   nations and also in the Murray- Darling River Basin in Australia."
 
 The chief minister was addressing a workshop on MJSA at the Rajasthan Agriculture Research Institute at Durgapura on Friday. She said the conventional water reservoir Jauhar in Bikaner, Tonka in Nagaur and the wide public participation at the MJASA programme at Jhalawar set an example for effective team work and planning that could take the state towards self-reliance in water.
 
 District collectors of Nagaur, Bikaner and Jhalawar gave presentations on innovations and public participations under the MJSA in their respective areas. The chief minister exhorted the officials to replicate the success stories and innovations of these districts in other places of the state.
 
 The chief minister also honored the officials for their exemplary work in water conservation and the philanthropists who contributed liberally to the cause.
