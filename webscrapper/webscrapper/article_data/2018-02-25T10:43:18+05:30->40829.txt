ITANAGAR: A partly burnt   has been discovered in Kamle district, about 100 km inside Indian territory. The mysterious object, seen hanging from a tree, was found by woodcutters at a place which can only be reached after a 5-km trek, said Kamle SP John Pada on Saturday. The machine was fastened to a parachute-like object, and it has Chinese inscriptions - including the number 3000 - on it, the SP added. 

 The object was found on February 21 when Pada, along with range forest officer   and few other officers, had trekked to Repari village under Raga circle, located at a height of 3642 feet. The village is between Ziro and Daporijo and also close to Tamen.
 
 What the team found at the spot was that a box had opened up after an impact with a tree and a black device was visible inside. A lower compartment probably stored a battery to power the device during flight. There was also a powdered substance spilled around the place. 
 
 Sources said there are metrological instruments which operate in this fashion and the 'mystery machine' might have been blown by wind into Arunachal, the state which has a 1080-km border with China. 
 
 Chinese home minister   pleaded ignorance and said the discovery has nothing to do with   relations. Director general of police Sandeep Goel assured to send the object to a forensic laboratory to ascertain its purpose.
