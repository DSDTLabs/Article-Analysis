JAISALMER:   (with a height of 300 metre) is installed at Ramgarh in  . But the tragedy is that in all border areas, transmission is not done at its complete capacity due to which people in these areas are forced to watch Pakistan's anti-India  . Pakistan has installed strong TV transmission towers in its border areas, thus, its programmes are seen in  . On Saturday, a special team of Doordarshan (DD) was here to survey many border areas of Jaisalmer to find the areas where TV programmes from Pakistan are being telecast. 

 Official sources said that around 20 years ago, 300-metre high TV tower was set up by spending Rs 5 crore. However, its main objective was not fulfilled as transmission is not reaching all the places. The signal is not reaching many places and residents of border areas are forced to see programmes that have anti-India propaganda. The tower at Ramgarh was installed with the idea that the residents of the area will be saved from watching programmes telecast by Pakistani channels. However, this never happened.
 
 Sources said that on Pakistani channels, maximum programmes are anti-India. Since people in these areas want some form of entertainment as they are end up watching programmes that show India in a bad light.
 
 According to sources, Pakistan by setting up strong transmission towers is continuing its publicity against India to create a rift between the two countries. Twenty years ago, transmission began three months after the TV tower was installed in Ramgarh. However, as the Pakistan border adjoining Jaisalmer is 471km long, the Ramgarh TV tower's transmission was not able to reach all the places.
