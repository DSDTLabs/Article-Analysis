PUNE: A 100-percentile score in the   for the   was anything but easy, but Pune’s Yash Choudhary marched his way to the top with sheer hard work.

 “I wrote a mock test almost every day leading up to the Common Admission Test ( ). It was difficult but I did it,” he told TOI on Monday.
 
 The final-year electrical engineering student from College of Engineering, Pune said his study routine to prepare for one of the toughest entrance examinations in the country had to be structured. He joined an institute known to train students for CAT and similar competitive examinations.
 
 “I joined TIME (a training institute) about a year ago, and I utilized their pointers and material, and also wrote their periodic tests as and when they happened,” Choudhary said.
 
 His perfect score will open the doors of every IIM in the country to him, subject to a round of interviews. This mathematics buff plans a career in finance after he graduates from IIM.
 
 “I don’t know which IIM I will get through to after the interviews. But my first choice is IIM Ahmedabad, followed by IIM Bengaluru and IIM Kolkata. I love mathematics, so my target is to study finance and hopefully find employment in that field,” he said.
 
 Choudhary’s parents work in private firms and are elated about their son’s results. “I am sure I am not the only one with a 100 percentile score. There must be a few from IIT Bombay with such a score because they are also very good,” he said.
