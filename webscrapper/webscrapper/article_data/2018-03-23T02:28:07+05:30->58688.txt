NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board plans to install bulk water meters at all its treatment plants and underground reservoirs by the year end. This will enable   audit of the city.

 Making water a major focus point, the allocation to   has been hiked by almost 20% to Rs 2,777 crore this year.
 
  
 “We do not know where 47% of the water supply is going — leakage or theft? In the past 70 years, we have no data on how much water is supplied to which colony,” Sisodia said, adding that this is set to change. The government will also upload the entire data on its website to help citizens know how much water is being supplied to their colony.
 
 The budget also emphasised on decentralising the sewerage system by setting up mini sewage treatment plants (STPs). Although, a similar announcement was made last year, eight areas have been specified in this year’s budget with a timeline for completion between March and December 2020. 
 
 Projects for expanding the sewage and water supply infrastructure, especially in unauthorised colonies, have also been announced. The government repeated last year’s proposal of connecting all unauthorised colonies with piped water supply by this year end. So far, 1,209 colonies of the total 1,665 are covered. Allocations have also been made to lay sewer lines in 162 more colonies.
 
 For improving the water supply in south and central Delhi, damaged pipelines at Wazirabad water treatment plant will be replaced. “We expect to save 4-5 million gallons of water per day by replacing 15km of pipelines,” Sisodia added. Budget allocations of Rs 427 crore have been made to sustain AAP’s flagship 20kl free water scheme, which is expected to benefit 4.5 lakh consumers every month.
