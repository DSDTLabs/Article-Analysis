It was the second episode of   without its favourite Dr Mashoor Gulati ( ). Kapil, who had a fall out with his friend and fellow comedian Sunil, was left with hosting the show all by himself sans his famous co-actors Chandan Prabhakar, Ali Asgar and Sunil.
 
  Everyone seemed to be missing the trio's funny antics on the show. Sunday's (March 26) episode began with   informing the audience and Navjot Singh Sidhu the importance of laughing. He then invited veteran comedian Raju Shrivastav on stage and   made way for Raju to entertain the audience.
  
  Raju in his unique style entertained the audience but somewhere everyone could be seen missing - Naani, Chandu chaiwala's brief appearances and Dr Gulati.
  
  After Raju, another guest at the show was the first winner of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge Ratan Pal. Known by his character name Ratan Noora, he decided to play the same character on this show as well. He is popular for sharing talks about drunkards and he did it this time as well.
  
  The third stand up comedian on the show is Ahsaan Qureshi. Ratal Lal joins Kapil and Raju in the audience. Post their solo performances, Kapil conversed with his guests and the audience.
  
  
 
  
  Kiku walked in as a milkman and entertained the guests with his jokes. Rochelle, who plays the role of Lottery in the show, walks in and meets the guests. Kapil tries to flirt with her, but she doesn't revert to it, instead shakes a leg with Raju Shrivastava, Ratan Pal and Ahsaan Qureshi.
  
  The show did not end as expected, and one of the major factors that went missing from the episode was fun and originality. We have been seeing these stand up comedians for years now, but the show missed out on its original concept of performing skits and that is what affected it drastically this time.
