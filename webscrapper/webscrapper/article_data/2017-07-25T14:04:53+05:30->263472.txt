AMRITSAR: Three bike-borne miscreants looted Rs 9 lakh from a petrol pump employee   near Alpha Mall on Monday afternoon. The incident took place when Narayan Das, an employee of Nihal Singh petrol pump, was on his way to the State Bank of India, Jalandhar Road branch to deposit his collection. 

 As Narayan was approaching the parking area of the bank, one of the miscreants tried to snatch his bag which had cash. When Narayan resisted, he pushed him away while his accomplice opened fire on him. As he escaped the bullet, the first offender pulled out a knife and tried to stab the him but ended up injuring Narayanâ€™s hand.
 
 Due to the injury, he loosened the grip as the miscreants snatched the bag and fled. Some people tried to follow the accused but failed as they pointed the gun at them to scare them away.
 
 Senior officials, including deputy police of commissioner Amrik Singh Pawar, reached the spot and instructed the cops to scan the footage of the CCTV cameras installed at the petrol pump and also outside the bank. The miscreant, who first attacked Narayan was not wearing a mask, while the two other accused had covered their faces.
