NEW DELHI: Though   failed to make it the   play-offs, franchise co-owner   has been caught on camera apparently delighted that defending champions   did not progress beyond the league stage either. 

 
 In a video that went viral on Twitter Sunday, the Hindi film star is seen turning to a fellow   entourage member and mouthing what looks to be like: “I am just very happy that Mumbai is not going to the finals … really happy.” 
 
 
 
 The video was tweeted by Twitter user @jogtweets and has been lapped up on social media. 
 
 
  
  
 
 The Ambani-owned Mumbai Indians, who have won the   title in three of the past five years, were beaten by   on Sunday to be eliminated from the play-off race. 
 
 In their last league match of IPL 2018, KXIP needed to beat   by at least 53 runs to seal passage to the play-offs, but a sub-par total of 153 all out in 19.4 overs meant that were always going to struggle to do so. As it panned out, CSK chased their target in 19.1 overs with five wickets in hand.
