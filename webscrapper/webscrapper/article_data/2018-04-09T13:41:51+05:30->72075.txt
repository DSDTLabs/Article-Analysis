QUEPEM: On any given day,   bus stand witnesses traffic chaos due to haphazard parking and absence of police personnel. 

 With four entry points into the bus stand, there is a constant flow of vehicles. While the bus stand itself is inadequate to cope with the parking requirement, space available in the core part of the town is also extremely insufficient. Motorists, pedestrians and commuters face tremendous hardship as the Curchorem traffic cell has not deployed policemen to regulate traffic at the congested bus stand. 
 
 Sanguem Municipal Council (SMC) has passed the blame onto the Curchorem traffic cell for not regulating vehicular movement. SMC chairperson   told TOI that as per the notification issued by the   district magistrate, the municipality with the assistance of traffic police, had demarcated space for buses, rickshaws and two-wheelers. However, two-wheelers and rickshaws chose to ignore these arrangements.
 
 The municipality had requested the traffic cell, on February 16, to deploy police on a permanent basis in Sanguem town/bus stand to monitor vehicular movement. However, as traffic police personnel are yet to be stationed, chaos at the bus stand is a daily occurance. “We have been deploying two workers, but bus owners and two-wheelers keep flouting traffic rules,” said Naik.
 
 After a joint inspection with the traffic cell in December 2017, the council had painted the designated places and installed traffic signboards. “The traffic police began issuing challans for irregular parking only for four days, but then disappeared,”   said.
 
 However, he alleged that three to four police officials have been seen issuing challans to two-wheelers riders for not wearing helmets at another spot outside the bus stand. 
 
 Replying to the allegations, Curchorem traffic cell PI   stated that police are deployed at Sanguem, but are sometimes diverted to carry out routine work.
