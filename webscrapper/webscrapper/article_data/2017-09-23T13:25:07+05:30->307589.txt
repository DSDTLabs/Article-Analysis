CHANDIGARH:  , lieutenant governor of Puducherry has voluntarily opted to teach at   a governance and leadership course which was launched on Friday during the Dr   memorial lecture. 

 While addressing the gathering she asked the vice-chancellor professor   to grant her an opportunity of being a faculty for the course. “I have understood the problem in the system which is leading to a weak leadership ultimately collapsing the entire system,” she said.
 
 “As a faculty I will ask all students to stay in villages for a week to understand the problems rather than giving them any theoretical lecture,” she added.
 
 She recommended that all government projects including ‘swachta abhiyan’ and corruption free country will not be successful till the officials leave the luxury of their offices and approach the public directly.
