BENGALURU: Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers H N Ananth   and BJP state president B S   were on Saturday directed by the first additional chief metropolitan magist rate court to provide their voice samples within seven days to cyber crime police.

 The directive comes in the wake of the duo's refusal to appear before cyber crime police, who are investigating a video in which the two leaders are reportedly speaking about having paid kickbacks to the BJP central leadership.The edited video was released by the Congress on February 13 this year to counter Yeddyurappa's allegations that chief minister   had sent Rs 1,000 crore, which was collected as bribe, to the party high command.
 
 In the video, Kumar is heard telling Yeddyurappa to keep the bribery allegations alive till the assembly polls next year. The video was recorded at a BJP function when Kumar and Yeddyurappa, who were oblivious to the microphone placed in front of them by a private television channel, were reportedly joking about the fallout of the bribery charges. The BJP downplayed the video saying it was an edited version and the voices could have been tampered.
 
 It was in this backdrop that the cyber crime police had issued notices to the two leaders to submit their voice samples for authentication.
