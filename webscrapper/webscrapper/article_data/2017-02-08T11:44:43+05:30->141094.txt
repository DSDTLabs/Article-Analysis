Often, heroines have to bear the brunt of the weather while shooting in extreme conditions. Irrespective of how high or low the temperature is, they are required to look glamourous. However, Kriti Sanon was faced with a peculiar problem while working on director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' and Dinesh Vijan’s 'Raabta'. While filming in the hot and humid Lucknow for Junglee Pictures’ 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', which has Ayushmann Khurrana playing the lead, Kriti wore woollens. On the other hand, she was spotted in breezy clothes while filming in the cold Budapest for 'Raabta', in which she co-stars with Sushant Singh Rajput. Kriti says, “My characters belong to different worlds. It was tough to adjust to my costumes. Imagine wearing turtlenecks and woollens in Lucknow when the climate was sultry! It was equally funny wearing summer dresses in the freezing temperatures of Budapest. I shot for both the films almost simultaneously and it took a toll on me. Still I’m not complaining because I got to soak in the cultures of these two cities.”
