NEW DELHI:What’s in a name? A lot of advertising revenue, as   (DMRC) has discovered in the past few years. Since 2014,   has been auctioning naming rights of select stations to companies and public sector undertakings to generate revenue. A total of 43 stations across NCR were either renamed or put on auction for naming rights in the last four years. However, the names of stations on panels inside the trains and during announcements have not been changed.

 A total of 14 stations, including Terminal 1 IGI Airport, IIT, Greater Kailash, Okhla NSIC, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Panchsheel Park and Sukhdev Vihar stations of Magenta Line and Delhi Cantt, Moti Bagh, Bhikaji Cama Place, INA, South Extension, Ashram and IP Extension stations of the   are next in line to get renamed.
 
 At some stations, such as FIITJEE IIT, DMRC has already put up signage with the new names and branded the stations with colours associated with the companies or undertakings that have bought the semi-naming rights in auction. Co-branding at metro stations is a substantial and lucrative source of revenue, but DMRC refuses to divulge the amount generated from it. Sources said it earns about Rs 2 crore per station every year, which translates into Rs 86 crore per annum from 43 stations.
 
 The naming rights are auctioned through agencies and the highest bidders get to prefix their company’s or organisation’s name to the name of a metro station. Renaming began in Delhi at ITO and   metro stations, which were prefixed with   and Honda 2 Wheelers, respectively.
