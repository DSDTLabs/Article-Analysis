NAGPUR: With the kharif season fast approaching, farmers are facing a new problem as nationalized banks are demanding a ‘search report’ from applicants of crop loan. Hassled farmers are complaining that it is unnecessary documentation wasting their time and money at a time when they have to concentrate on tilling the lands being readied for the next crop and getting other inputs together.

 “At a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is appealing for paperless working in offices, this new demand for a piece of paper from banks is forcing farmers to run pillar to post,” said  , a farmer from   in Dhamangaon Rly taluka of Amravati district. 
 
 He said the search report was earlier needed only for non-crop farm-related loans. “But now even for ordinary crop loans taken every season attaching the search report has been made compulsory,” Deshpande added.
 
 A search report has to be procured from the tehsildar’s office. It conveys the status of ownership and mortgage liabilities if any. “When my 70-year-old father went to draw the loan, the   branch officials at the village told him that while the loan has been sanctioned it could be disbursed only after search report is submitted,” said Deshpande.
 
 According to him, most farmers are illiterate and will now have to approach a lawyer and pay him a fee for procuring the search report. “It takes anything from a week to two to get the process completed with all loan seekers rushing to the same lawyer in the village,” said Deshpande, adding that a 7/12 extract would have easily served the purpose as it is accessible to farmers.
 
 A senior official of the public sector bank said that the search paper is necessary for loans above Rs1 lakh only. “It is a   rule and has been there for long time. There are instructions to implement it strictly now,” said the banker.
