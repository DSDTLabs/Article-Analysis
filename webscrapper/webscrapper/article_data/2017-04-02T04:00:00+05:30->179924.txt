Ahmedabad: The angry words of an IPS officer in the DGP office on Friday shocked everyone present nearby. Apparently, a case of threatening that took place within Surat city was being probed by the Surat district police as they were handling the original disproportionate assets case of a junior cop, linked with the threatening incident. Following representations from affected parties, the DGP office had transferred the probe of the case of threatening to Surat city police.

 This made an IPS officer rush to the DGP office in Gandhinagar to register his protest over the transfer of the case. However when the DGP office refused to revert the case back, the IPS officer threatened loudly to take the matter to the “highest” level.
 
 According to sources in the police, the disproportionate assets case against a junior police officer was registered in October 2016 by the Surat district police. “During investigation, it came to light that the police officer, who almost throughout his career had enjoyed plum postings, had allegedly amassed wealth much exceeding his legal sources of income,” a senior police officer said.
 
 According to the sources, another case of threatening a man with dire consequences was registered in connection with the same DA case but in the city police jurisdiction as the alleged threat took place in Surat city. But the probe of that case, too, was taken by the Surat district police. 
 
 Aggrieved parties then made representations to the DGP office which transferred the case of threatening to the city police. 
 
 “The protesting IPS officer could not get the case transferred back to his jurisdiction. He then vowed to take the issue to the highest level to prove his point,” said a source. 
 
 The angry words of the senior IPS officer did not yield the results he desired but they have certainly become a talking point in the DGP office.
