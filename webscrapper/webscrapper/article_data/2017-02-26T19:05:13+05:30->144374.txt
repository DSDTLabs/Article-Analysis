Thaikkudam Bridge's singer   from musical magic has been such that his mellifluous voice has managed to strike a chord with very Malayali music lover, and he has made every girl's heart go dhak-dhak with his endearing charm. 

 Now, this recent social networking post from him is likely to break the hearts of many, and it goes like this, 'If there is one thing that i have understood and embraced in life, it is the fact that change is the only constant. This decision has been the toughest and the most emotional.   was, is and will always be my family. The band is the sole reason where i am today in my life and i will never stop being grateful for it. Though this is a break that im taking and not a crossroad forever, i will miss being part of all the mad gigs we have and all the soulful music we ve been fortunate to create together from the heart. 
 Keep supporting me and the band unconditionally like always, as we embark on our journey forward. (sic).'
 
 And, it looked like the members of the band Thaikkudam Bridge were equally feeling uneasy, nevertheless, they wished him the very best for future endeavours, They posted, 'Wishing our dearest Siddharth a very happy journey ahead as he sets foot to pursue his solo dreams. Though this is not an end to our journey together with him, we will miss him. Love and Good luck bro #bethebridge (sic).'
