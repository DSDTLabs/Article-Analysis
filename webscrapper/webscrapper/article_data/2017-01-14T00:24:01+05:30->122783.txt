Pune: The Indian Army’s College of Military Engineering ( ) would install a solar power plant on its Dapodi campus to reduce its electricity bill — around Rs9 crore annually.

 CME authorities stressed the move would reduce 75% of the electricity expenses of the 35,000 acre campus, housing about 15,000 people. The Rs100 crore project was sanctioned by the government in the last financial year.
 
 The project has commenced and will be completed in three phases. The first phase is expected to be completed by the end of this year. 
 
 An officer from CME said, “After the completion of the first phase, the project will generate 2MW electricity. The remaining two phases will be completed by 2022. About 12MW electricity will be generated once the project is completed.”
 
 The excess electricity will be passed on to the state electricity distribution company’s grid. “We approached the state government. Officials expressed willingness to absorb the excess electricity,” the officer said.
 
 According to the officer, the institute requires 3MW electricity monthly. It costs around Rs75 to Rs 80 lakh.
