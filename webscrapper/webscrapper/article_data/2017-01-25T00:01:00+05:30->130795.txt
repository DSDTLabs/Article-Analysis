Chennai: Prison officials nabbed a jail assistant for   ganja into   on Monday. The contraband was stuffed inside pens.

 The prison officials frisked the jail assistant Periya Karuppan, 28, a resident of Puzhal prison quarters, as he often visited a particular prison block whenever in the morning. Some prison wardens complained of his unusual visits to the prison cells in the block to the superintendent of prisons.
 
 The officials didn’t find any suspicious materials from Periya Karuppan initially. Then they asked him to submit his pens, mobile phone and purse. He submitted three brand new ball pens. The pens wrote normally, but weighed more than normal. When questioned, Periya Karuppan told the prison officials that the model always weighed more. However, he didn’t give proper replies for the officials’ further questions.
 
 Growing suspicious, the officials opened the rear portion of the pens and found the refill was cut to a short length and the rest of the space stuffed with ganja. The   in the pens weighed about 200 grams.
 
 Periya Karuppan didn’t reveal the names of those who got ganja from him. Based on the complaint of the prison warden, the Puzhal police registered a case and arrested Periya Karuppan and a judicial magistrate court in Tiruvottiyur remanded him in prison.
