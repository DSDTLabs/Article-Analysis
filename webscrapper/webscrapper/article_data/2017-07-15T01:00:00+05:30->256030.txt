GAYA: Adopting a tough stand against the   of the 44 constituent colleges of the university, Magadh University (MU)   has directed the principals not to tolerate obstruction caused by the agitating staff and seek administrative help to rein in those trying to disrupt the functioning of the colleges.

 Nearly 2,000 non-teaching employees of the constituent colleges spread over seven districts of Magadh and Patna divisions are on   for the fulfilment of their demands. The demands of the striking employees include implementation of assured career promotion (ACP) and total parity with non-teaching employees of the university headquarters.
 
 The VC’s direction to the college principals has been conveyed through an official letter issued by  , the university's registrar. In no case, the employees should be allowed to cause obstruction to the ongoing admission process and other student-related exercises, said the letter.
 
 The registrar’s letter says the ACP has already been implemented as per rules and implementation-related grievances would be effectively addressed. The letter further says that guidelines have been sought from director, higher education, in respect of time-bound promotion.
