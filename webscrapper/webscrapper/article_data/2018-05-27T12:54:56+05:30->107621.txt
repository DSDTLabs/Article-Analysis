HYDERABAD : A leopard was found dead with injuries in   of Bhainsa forest division in   on Saturday. Forest officials suspect poaching.

 Nirmal district forest officer   told STOI: “We found the carcass near a pond 100 metres outside the notified forest. It is a male leopard aged around two-and-half years. There are external injuries and wildlife veterinary experts will conduct a post mortem examination on Sunday to find out the cause of death.”
 
 
 Wildlife activists alleged that this is the sixth leopard killed in the state this year. The modes operandi of poachers is that they move in two vehicles. “The first vehicle goes with weapons and the second comes with the meat. When the first vehicle is caught, they feign ignorance and warn the other vehicle which makes its escape,” said an official.
