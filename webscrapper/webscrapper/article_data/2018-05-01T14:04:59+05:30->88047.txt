COIMBATORE: Alleging that   ring road project is designed in such a way that it runs over hundreds of acres of farming land, a group of farmers on Monday filed a petition to the district collector urging him to reconsider the project.

 “Agriculture is the main source of our livelihood and the project is planned in such a way that it is affected,” said V  , a resident of   in Annur.
 
 The project, which was aimed at reducing traffic congestion at Annur and bring big relief to the commuters, is designed in such a way that it covers about 300 acres of farming land, the farmers added.
 
 Citing that over 500 families are bound to be affected by the project, the farmers said that most of the farmers, who are land owners, own only two or three acres.
 
 “I have two acres of farm land and the project is designed in such a way that the road passes through my land, thus leaving five cent on either side,” said Gandhinadhan, explaining that nothing could be done with just five cents of land on the border of a road.
 
 Explaining that they are growing coconut trees, banana trees, sugarcane and cultivating wheat and everything would be destroyed, the farmers said that the government has agreed to give only Rs 8 lakh per acre with which not even a few cents could be brought in that area. They petitioned the collector after highway authorities started to mark the borders on Friday. “The government should provide us alternative land instead of giving us the money,” a farmer said.
 
  assured to take necessary steps and forwarded the petition to the highways department. Officials at highways department said that they will inspect the area. TNN
