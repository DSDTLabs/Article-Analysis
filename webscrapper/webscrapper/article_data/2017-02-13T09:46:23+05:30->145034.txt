LUDHIANA: Now, Aam Aadmi Party will keep a tab on Jagraon constituency strongroom, too, with the district administration on Sunday allowing it to set up a tent outside the room at Punjab Agricultural University. 

 AAP candidate from Jagraon constituency   Manuke had been seeking permission to install tent for volunteers for a week. A district administration official visited PAU on Sunday and earmarked a site for AAP supporters from where they can keep an eye on the strongroom, where electronic voting machines are stored. The strongroom of Jagraon constituency is at PAU Examination Centre.
 
 Claiming that they were given space far away from the strongroom, AAP volunteers said the administration has not even installed LCD screens inside their tent as has been done for other constituencies, like Gill and North. 
 
 “We have been seeking proper arrangements since the election day, but officials ignored our pleas. After we met deputy commissioner Ravi Bhagat and sought his intervention on Saturday, the officials swung into action,” said Sarabjit Kaur. 
 
 AAP district observer  , who accompanied the candidate to the university, said, “The administration is not properly implementing the   guidelines. The Jagraon constituency strongroom was not cordoned off, with students freely roaming around the site. Following our complaints, the officials have tied a rope around the site to guard it.” 
 
 Assistant returning officer   said, “The matter has been sorted out. We have fulfilled the demands of the candidate and her supporters.” 
 
 AAP volunteers are camping outside most of the strongrooms. The administration installed LCD screens outside the rooms after the party alleged security arrangements were lax.
