AHMEDABAD: The state government has pulled out all the stops to staunch the flow of liquor in dry Gujarat. After implementing a new, more stringent liquor laws, stipulating longer jail terms and bigger fines, the government is looking for diving intervention and has roped in four respected spiritual leaders from across religions, to appeal to the masses to give up vices like alcohol and gambling.

  The website of the state prohibition department has videos of noted kathakar Morari Bapu, BAPS founder Pramukh Swami, Bishop V M Malaviya,   and   of the historic Ahmedabad Jama Masjid.
 
  
  Morari Bapu, in his video message, says that many believe that the sale of liquor enhances the state wealth in duty and taxes. Bapu says he believes health is more important than wealth. “Good health means a person is in good mental condition and can look after his family well,” says Bapu in his video message. 
 
 Mufti Shabbir Alam of the Jama Masjid focuses more on the values of Islam. He says consumption of liquor and other intoxicating substances is the biggest sin.
 
 “Vices such as alcohol and gambling have crept into society and people should stay themselves away from such vices,” says the mufti.
 
 The bishop of the   says the anti-prohibition drive will have better results if more religious leaders are roped in to spread the message.
 
 Swami Sacchidanand says that the worst affected are poor people who spend their most of their wages on liquor and gambling. “If people abstain from such vices and the new prohibition laws are implemented, the poor will benefit the most,” Swami says in his message.
 
 Director, prohibition and excise, B K Kumar, said that apart from the implementation of strict prohibition laws, the people of Gujarat are more greatly influenced by religious leaders.
 
 “Hence, we put messages from religious and spiritual leaders, appealing to the masses to give up vices like alchohol and gambling,” Kumar said.
