CHANDIGARH: If local BJP leaders in Chandigarh think they can impress the party high command in Delhi by triggering a rebellion ahead of the   in the city and secure a   ticket in 2019, they are wrong. This was made clear by  , national vice-president, BJP, and in-charge of Chandigarh and Punjab affairs, in an exclusive talk with TOI

 Pointing out the party will now bow down to any pressure tactics, he called politics a game of “luck”. “One does work for the betterment and progress of the party and not for getting a ticket. Let me say it clearly that getting a ticket is completely a game of luck. In fact, politics is a game of luck. You do well, but it is not sure you will get the ticket,” Jha said.
 
 Sources said some of the leaders, while aspiring for the Lok Sabha ticket in 2019, had decided to show their strength and set off a rebellion in the party. “This is not the way to get a ticket at all. It is important to show commitment towards the party and work to strengthen it as we are moving towards the 2019 parliamentary elections,” Jha said. “If there is any infighting to get a parliamentary ticket, it should not come out in the open. The organisation’s decisions are supreme,” Jha added.
 
 Sources in the Chandigarh BJP said the year is crucial for all the groups as many have begun to show their strength to claim the ticket. “Like the last elections, this time too there are going to be many claimants for the ticket,” sources said.
 
 However, groupism has cost the party dear. Recently, one of its five candidates, Heera Negi, lost the election of the   and Contract Committee (F&CC) to Devinder Babla of the Congress. Cross-voting also hurt the party in 2015 mayoral elections, when Congress’ Poonam Sharma bagged the mayor’s post despite BJP having a majority with 16 councillors.
