When   signed 'Raees', he found people telling him, 'Oh Shah Rukh Khan aap   ho, you are rich'. But the star knew that the word had a much deeper meaning than just that. In an interview to Bombay Times, Shah Rukh explained what raees was all about. 

 'There are some words in Urdu, in English and in other languages, which stand for a little deeper meaning that what it seems to be on the face of it. So on the surface, people feel that raees is just rich, financially or economically rich. But that is not true. Raees means benevolent actually.'
 
 Shah Rukh feels that though this not an often spoken word, but we do come across phrases like 'Arre bhut raees aadmi hai or Dil ka bahut raees hai, or Bahut raeesi hai iski'. For him, however, raeesi is an attitude and is not about how much money one has. He says, 'Even if you are not financially well off, the way you treat people around you, the ones who work with you, or are your friends or move along with you ' the benevolence with which you treat them, is what makes you raees.'
 
 He believes that even a fakir can be raees and explains, 'It is about how giving you are and how you think of others in your line of work ' whether you take people along with you. So it is benevolence, in whatever space you are in. You do not need to be rich to be benevolent. It is a state of mind and heart. So yes, even a fakir can be actually very raees.'
 
 These stellar qualities are present in all of us feels  . He says, 'I think all of us have a raees in us. We all are somewhere creatures of sensitivity and goodness. I think sometimes it gets curtailed with the world around us, the days we are having and the cynicism that surrounds us. But I think it all comes down to wanting to give back and not just to the society and doing a social cause but just to each other. I think I have been told at times by my co workers that I am a very giving actor. So yeah, I hope I am. And if I am, then I am raees.'
