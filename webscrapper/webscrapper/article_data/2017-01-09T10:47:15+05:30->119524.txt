LUCKNOW: He saw three fellow villagers, including his brother-in-law die on the spot. Recalling the horror, resident of Matiha village in Bahraich, Raju went quiet on Sunday noon. “It feels like having experienced death,” he said.

 He was supposed to go off to sleep at the same spot which came under the impact of the speeding car. Raju had stepped out to relieve himself when the accident took place. “When I rushed inside the shelter, I saw my brother-in-law Prithvi Raj (32) dead. Two more persons Gokaran and Abdul Kalam alias Nankau were lying motionless too,” said Raju, who informed police about the accident and lodged an FIR against the duo in car. Raju cleaned up with   the pieces of flesh and   that had fallen on other injured persons of the shelter. 
 
 Bones and   were   on the quilts and mat. Someone’s abdomen had been thrown open while someone’s brain had popped out. Identity of the fifth deceased person could not be ascertained as his face had been disfigured beyond recognition.
 
 The car’s fender was also soaked in blood while its bumper had fallen apart. Iron pillar, tree guards, iron pole and the compound wall of Butler Palace colony was torn away by the impact of collision. Meanwhile, the two occupants were so heavily   they had no idea of the hell they had let loose on five families.
 
 Raju said 70% homeless labourers who used the shelter home were from Bahraich district while remaining were from Sitapur. “People from the same village stay together in smaller groups. We are daily wage labourers who struggle every day for a living and survive in toughest conditions. I feel hollow inside. Officials have promised us help and we are waiting for it,” said Raju.
 
 By noon relatives and kin of four deceased persons reached KGMU’s mortuary. Gokaran’s brother did not have enough money to take his body back to the native village. “We have asked people to pool money and help us,” added Raju. Prithvi left behind wife Meena and son Susheel.
