KOLKATA: The   on Tuesday   to   Arindam Bhattacharya, who is facing several charges including rioting, to   from   in Netherlands.

 Though initially he was barred from visiting Santipur, the court had granted him conditional bail that allowed him to visit his constituency once a week. The court had also put an embargo on his overseas trips.
 
 He was charged under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (preventing public servant from conducting duty), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 283 (obstructing line of navigation), following a boat capsize on May 14 last year in which several lives were lost. However, Bhattacharya claimed he had gone to the ghat to help with the rescue operation and the charges against him were fabricated. He further claimed he was assaulted by the cops.
 
 Justice Nadira Patherya who heard the MLA’s petition, granted him the permission to go to Europe for high studies and appreciated his efforts. Bhattacharya, who is in his mid-thirties, recently completed his LLM (master of laws) from Italy said, he is happy his petition was granted and hoped the fabricated cases would be scrapped soon. “The charges were levelled against me just before the polls with a political motive, as the results were delcared on May 19. The court also understood there is no merit in those charges and allowed me to travel overseas. My cases would have been dropped if I had joined Trinamool.”
