PANAJI: The survivor in the four-year-old alleged rape case against former Tehelka founder-editor Tarun   completed her deposition before additional sessions judge Vijaya Pol at   on Friday. The next hearing, on three applications filed by Tejpal seeking additional documents and call records from the prosecution, is likely to be on April 7. 

 The in camera trial in the case commenced on Thursday. Special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora told TOI that the examination in chief has been completed, and April 7 will see the reply on argument on the three applications. The cross-examination of the survivor will be conducted after that, but the date hasnâ€™t been given yet. 
 
 The Supreme Court had directed the court to complete the trial within three months. The Mapusa court, in September 2017, framed charges against Tejpal for raping a junior colleague in a five-star hotel at   in November 2013. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial. Earlier, Tejpal had, through a criminal revision application, challenged the framing of charges by the additional district and sessions court.
 
 On December 20, 2017, the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed Tejpal's application.
 
 Tejpal has been charged for offences under Sections 354 (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over women, committing rape of such women) and 376(2) (k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman).
