Ahmedabad: One year after a series of raids were carried out against con call centres — which were duping US citizens using various lures such like cheap loans — fragments of the organized gangs that operated them have shifted base and are continuing with the activity. 

 On Thursday, Adalaj police busted a call centre involved in fraudulent activities and apprehended five persons, all of them from Ahmedabad.
 
 Adalaj police said they raided Vrundavan Bungalows at Pundrasan near Uvarsad early on Thursday and nabbed Nikhil Ravani, Pratik Baviskar, Pritamsingh Rajput, Nikesh Chauhan, Tushar Kashyap and Sachin Pandya, all residents of Ahmedabad. The group was found in possession of five laptops and 11 mobile phones and other valuables.
 
 “We got the names of Sohel Ansari, Rohit Lalwani and Rudra Banerjee as the other accused, who helped the group with data and payment processing,” said an Adalaj police official, adding that the laptops were sent for forensic analysis.
