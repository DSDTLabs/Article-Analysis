Cops are trying to get some clues from the shirt buttons, pieces of cloth and liquor bottles found at the spot. A few rickshawpullers and drug addicts found near the park have been detained for questioning.

 
 The   was   and her face crushed with stones, which were found next to the body. She was also dragged as there were bruises on the body. Since the face is disfigured, the victim has not been identified. She was about five feet tall with a wheatish complexion. She was wearing a soiled salwar suit, which was torn in the chest area.
 
 The body will be preserved at LNJP hospital for the next 72 hours as per protocol in such cases.

 Locals told police that they had seen the woman entering the park with some youths. Prime facie it appears that the woman used to stay on the footpath near Rajghat.

The pieces of cloth and buttons have been sent for forensic analysis.

A hue and cry notice has been raised seeking details of missing women from nearby areas. Details have been uploaded on Zipnet, the repository of missing people and unidentified bodies.
