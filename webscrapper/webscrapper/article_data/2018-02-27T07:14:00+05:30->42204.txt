Noida: The Mahamaya Balika Inter College in Sector 93 has become the first government school in Noida to get a vending machine for sanitary napkins in its hostel on Monday. Students and hostellers were given demonstration on the functioning of the machine which has been donated to the school by an NGO on Monday.

 Girls can get one sanitary napkin at a time by putting a one-rupee coin in the machine. “This can be a great help in emergency situations when a need for the sanitary napkin arises. We will be able to evade embarrassing situations,” Priyanka, a student of Class XI told TOI.
 
 Another student said the vending machine will especially help those students who start menstruating for the first time and who do not have a fixed menstruation cycle.
 
 Students said that such a machine should be installed in all the girls or co-education schools. Later, a session was also held with the students with a gynaecologist about personal hygiene where students discussed their gynaecological problems.
 
 Sheema Krishna, a gynaecologist associated with a private hospital in Sector 27 said the students came forward with many teenage-related problems while some complained of irregular periods.
 
  Pratibha Singh, principal of the inter college, told TOI that the management would welcome any private company or NGO for installation of such machines and the government should also pitch in for this initiative.
