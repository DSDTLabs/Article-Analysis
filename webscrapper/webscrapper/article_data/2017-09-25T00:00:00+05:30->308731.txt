It took 10th grader   just nine months to figure out what is polluting our lakes and what can be done to fix the problem. That may seem like a long time to some, but not if you consider the fact that in that time, she figured out that most of the information available online — even on government sites — was largely inaccurate. So, she set out to conduct a study of lakes in the city (she chose Ulsoor, Bellandur, Hebbal, Puttenahalli and  ), correlate the level of water pollution to the level of urbanization and related activities around the lake, drew maps, collected water samples, ran tests to investigate the level of contamination in the water, identified the source of the water pollution in lakes, investigated steps taken by government and non-government bodies to tackle the pollution, and suggested measures to reduce the water pollution in city. 
A student of Mallya Aditi International School, all this was part of Adya’s Geography thesis for her board exam, for which she got 100% marks from the IGCSE board.
 The hypothesis she was given was this: The main reason for increased water pollution in cities is improper waste disposal or the increased amount of waste in the city due to urbanization. “I partially agreed with the hypothesis, since I found that the increased amount of waste is due to urbanization, but the increased amount of water pollution is due to improper waste disposal. In other populous cities cities like Tokyo, they have proper waste disposal systems, so it doesn’t lead to water pollution. But here, the waste is not properly disposed and gets dumped into the lakes. So, urbanization per se cannot be blamed for water pollution; improper methods of handling urbanization is to blame,” says Adya.
 THREE MAIN FORMS OF LAKE POLLUTION
 According to Adya, there are three main forms of lake pollution:
 - Encroachment
 - Debris dumping
 - Toxic effluence from garbage
 NO RELIABLE DATA
 For her secondary research, Adya found it very difficult to find data online. “I needed data from reliable sources, which usually is government sites. But I was surprised to find that the information on such sites was also wrong. Many of the sites stated that all the lakes are acidic, which is not true. I personally collected water samples from the five lakes and found that only the   was neutral (this is a result of the efforts of the residents in cleaning up the lake). All other lakes have a PH of 10, which is basic and not acidic,” she says. To gather more information, Adya spoke to lakes expert Ashwin Mahesh, who told her that lakes have the capacity to restore themselves, as they degrade all the toxins. But the amount of waste that we are dumping into them is too much for the lake to take — they are unable to keep up.
 RESPONSIBILITY SPLIT, YET NO ACTION
 The 183 lakes in the city come under different jurisdictions, like Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP),   (BDA), Lake Development Authority (LDA) and the Karnataka Forest Department. The   has been given the responsibility of 17 lakes, but Adya found that they have sufficient funds for only three lakes.
 WHAT THE AUTHORITIES CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THE THESIS
 After the primary (questionnaires) and secondary (information from the internet, newspapers and other publications) research, Adya found that the sewerage treatment network didn’t expand in proportion to city’s growth. Her suggestions to fix the problem include:
 - Mandate that all buildings be connected to STPs, so that sewerage is not dumped into kaluves.
 - Large communities away from the CBD should build their own STPs in apartment complexes as a first level of treatment.
 - A sewerage treatment network must be put into place before building plans are approved.
 - Individual steps, such as segregation of waste at home and dumping garbage in proper places plays a big role. A lot of garbage ends up being dumped into the kaluves, which get blocked and cause flooding during rains.
 - Many parts of the city don’t have proper sewerage networks, resulting in leakage and mixing of sewerage with storm water. This needs to be fixed.
 - Some sewerage pipes lead straight into lakes — which are supposed to a source of fresh water — thereby polluting lakes.
 - Corruption plays a big role in averting the sewerage treatment network. As does poor planning and flawed execution. The BBMP must close the deficit at the earliest.
 “The BBMP has listed out steps to improve the situation, but the city is growing at a quick pace, and implementation is very slow. I was surprised that the information on most sites — even government ones — was inaccurate and outdated. So, there is a need for this to be updated, since the information can be used to create more awareness among citizens. This is important as when I asked people if they knew where their waste was going, no one really knew,” says Adya.
 
 STPs UNDERUTILIZED 
 Many lakes have sewerage treatment plants (STPs), but they are underutilized, as a result of which 30% of the sewerage water is left untreated. There are three levels of treatment at the STPs — primary, secondary and tertiary. The last step (tertiary) is required only for drinking water, but the water can be sent back to lakes after the secondary stage. “But even that is not being done,” says Adya. Summing up the rather sorry state of affairs, Tara Krishnaswamy, activist and Adya’s mother, says, “If it’s easy enough for a 10th grader to figure out how to revive our lakes, it’s not difficult for the authorities to find the root cause and solve the issue.”
