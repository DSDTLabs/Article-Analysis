They may have become household names after participating on "Dance India Dance" and several other dance reality shows but   Yelande and   Juyal say they still don't consider themselves a celebrity.
 
  
 
  
  Dharmesh participated on "DID" in 2010 and was named the show's first runner-up. He then went on to choreograph for "Tees Maar Khan" and appeared on films like "ABCD - Anybody Can Dance" and "ABCD 2".
  
  Raghav rose to fame after being a finalist on "DID" season 3. He also had a role in the 2015 Varun Dhawan-Shraddha Kapoor starrer.
  
  But it seems the duo has not let their stardom go to their head as in an interview to PTI, the two say, "We never act like a celebrity. We go anywhere... Eat everything. We're still locals.
  
  "We love to travel. And if we're free or at home, we like to go out for parties because Bombay's night life is amazing."
  
  The duo says their bond got stronger after they worked together on "ABCD 2".
  
  "We have been together since Raghav did 'DID'. After doing ' ' we became really good friends. Now, we do a lot of parties. We hangout together. So, we are desi kind of people."
  
  The two currently appear on "Dance Plus 3" alongside Shakti Mohan and choreographer-director Remo D'Souza.
  
  Raghav is hosting the show, while Dharmesh is a mentor and Remo is the super judge.
  
  Dharmesh has been quite vocal about his rapport with Remo, with whom he has worked in "ABCD" film series and reality shows like "DID- Dance Ke Superstars", "Dance Plus" and "Dance Plus 2".
  
  "We have a very good bond with Remo sir which everybody knows. We are just like a family so there is a good connection between us and the audience.
  
  "In '  3' you will see the next level of dance. Remo sir is bringing his own team of international dancers and judges' team have to beat them."
  
  "Dance Plus 3" airs on  .
