LUCKNOW:   (SP) national president and CM   on Monday said his party would win the elections and the alliance with the Congress was meant to consolidate the people's verdict. He also expressed hope that party patriarch   would campaign in the elections. 

 On Sunday, Mulayam had rejected the SP-Congress tie-up and refused to capmaign for the alliance. Responding to a question on Mulayam's comment, Akhilesh said: "Main chahunga Netaji campaign mein aayen kyon ki sarkar unhin ki banne ja rahi hai" (I want Netaji (Mulayam) to campaign because his party will form the next government)” during an interview to a news channel. "Nobody will be happier than Netaji, if his party comes to power again in the state,” he added. 
 
 About the SP founder's objection to the SP-Congress alliance, Akhilesh said it was necessary to firm up the people’s verdict. On Mulayam's statement that SP was capable of winning the elections alone, he said: "Even I agree that SP was capable of winning a majority on its own, but with the alliance we will win over 300 seats. The alliance will help to do away with any confusion among the voters as to who will form the next government in the state."
 
 On the issue of Mulayam's concern for the SP leaders who will not be able to contest from 105 seats which have gone to the Congress as a part of the seat-sharing formula under the alliance, Akhiklesh said every alliance calls for adjustments on both the sides and such leaders should let go their claims for the sake of the party.
 
 Later, addressing a series of five public meetings in Aliganj, Etah, Patiyali, Amapur and Kasganj, Akhilesh said SP had the blessings Mulayam Singh Yadav and there was no doubt in his mind that the party would form the government in UP after the assembly polls. In his address he spelt out the highlights of the party manifesto and assured better infra-structure and health services at government medical facilities in the state in his next stint as the chief minister.
