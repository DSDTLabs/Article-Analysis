Balakrishna’s 100th film   has been going strong at the box office. The film collected 36.04 Cr in 15 days in the twin Telugu states. It’s first week which had a great run collected mostly in the A centres while it fell flat at the B and C centres. That evidently has caused the drop in potential collections.   starring Balakrishna and Shriya Saran is a treat to particularly Nandamuri fans with powerful dialogues.
