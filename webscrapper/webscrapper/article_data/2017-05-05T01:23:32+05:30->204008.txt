NEW DELHI: Three days after the shootout at Mianwali Nagar,   has declared a   of Rs 1 crore for the family members of the assistant sub-inspector shot dead while trying to protect the alleged gangster Monu Dariyapur. Meanwhile, police have recovered   from the market at J block where the incident happened which confirmed the  , which TOI had earlier reported.

 Sources said that Khatri and the prime suspect Sonu Dariyapur were seen in the footage carrying three bags, probably containing the weapons that they later handed over to the shooters who used them to kill Monu Dariyapur.
 
 Police have come across some clues regarding the identity of the shooters involved in Sunday night’s killings in which they suspect the role of some youths who work at the toll booths at the Bawana-Auchandi border. 
 
 The probe revolves around the role of some arms suppliers from Meerut who police suspect could be connected to Monu. They could have used Khatri and Sonu’s rivalry to eliminate Monu after they suspected him of colluding with the police to bust some supply routes. Delhi Police had cracked down on arms suppliers last year.
 
 A police team has been camping in Meerut to identify the suppliers who were in contact with Khatri and Sonu. Sources close to Monu Dariyapur have confirmed to the police that there was mistrust between his business partners. Even on the day of the incident, he had met one Gaurav to settle a previous case regarding arms supplies which is also being probed.
 
 Monu Dariyapur’s wife Raj Rani has meanwhile sought protection from the cops saying that some of the members of the rival group might have been following her. The government officials said that they would contact the family members in Rohini to hand over the compensation money on Friday.
