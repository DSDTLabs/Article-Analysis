CHARMINAR:   is in for a makeover as the   and Museums (DAM) is getting ready for conservation work.
An administrative sanction of Rs 8.48 crore is perhaps the first substantial grant in several years .
 
 A detailed report on the current condition of Mecca Masjid identifies three key areas of intervention: the roof, water seepage through stone joints and general maintenance. Interestingly, bird droppings are also a major cause of concern as they cause acidic reactions on the exteriors.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Department of Archaeology and Museums director   explained that layers of waterproofing material and bitumen have created problems for the structure. “These layers have increased the load on the structure. A careful removal of these layers is propo sed. The bird droppings have also caused problems.They clog water spouts.
 
 There are pigeon holes on the roof. These too have to be dealt with,“ she said, adding that layers of bird droppings have accumulated on the major chajjas, or eaves, of the masjid.
 
 A strength analysis of the structure is also on the cards. This is being done to check the extent of damage on account of water seepage. The minarets have also been affected due to water seepage through the stone masonry .
 
 “We are going to install fine nets, which will not affect the aesthetics of the structure, to prevent birds from sitting,“ Visalatchy sa id. The power cables and wires inside the main structure will also be rearranged.
 
 Since the masjid is largely constructed on stone, the plan is to have cables and wires run along its periphery. The report also recommends intervention at the entrance of the Mecca Masjid. Several layers of enamel paint will be removed from the doors.
 
 Original ornamentation and other architectural details, which have been hidden by lime mortar will also be restored.
 
 “The line estimates have been called. As soon as the detailed estimates arrive, tenders will be called for and work will begin,“ the director said.
