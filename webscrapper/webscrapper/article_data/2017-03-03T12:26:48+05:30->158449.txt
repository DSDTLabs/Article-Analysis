Hollywood legend Jane   has revealed that she was raped and sexually abused when she was a child. The 79-year-old star, in an interview with actress Brie  , explained that she often felt diminished with the men in her life.

 "I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss and I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing," Fonda told Larson, who has been a vocal advocate for abuse. 
 
 The Oscar-winning actress touched upon the power of the word 'No' by saying, "Unlike you, Brie, it took me 60 years to learn how to say no... If anyone offered me anything I would say yes. I took parts I wasn't right for and I was taken advantage of." 
 
 Earlier at an event in 2014, Fonda revealed her mother,   was sexually abused as a child before committing suicide when the actress was just 12.
