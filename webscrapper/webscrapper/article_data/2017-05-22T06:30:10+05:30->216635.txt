BAREILLY:   of four members of the   who were   in a robbery attempt at their home, met   and submitted their plea over the present status of the case as three of the accused have walked out on bail.
 
  City-based businessman Naresh Sethi (45), his wife Shikha (42) and their two teenage children were found murdered at their home in Veer Savarkar Nagar here in September 2016.
  
  The chargesheet in the case has already been filed and police, in a bid to tighten the noose, had booked the accused under Gangster Act but three of them have managed to successfully secure bail. The family members of the victims have since been trying to get justice.
  
  "Three of the four accused secured bail and two of the assailants are still absconding. The prime accused in the case are history sheeters and have the patronage of a former MLA. Our plea to police for action is falling on deaf ears even as SSP Jogendra Kumar has assured us that the accused will soon be booked under National Security Act (NSA)," Surendra Sethi, complainant and elder brother of Naresh Sethi said.
  
  "Strictest action should be taken against such people to ensure a gruesome crime like this is not repeated,” Surendra added.
  
  A city-based businessman, Vishal Agarwal, his aide Anil and two other men — Shankar, a resident of Baheri and Brijesh Gupta, a trader from Faridpur — were arrested for orchestrating the robbery-cum-murder. Two other assailants, Guddu and Arshad, hailing from Devraniya in Bareilly and Shahjahanpur, respectively, are still at large. A police reward of Rs 12,000 has been announced for leads on their whereabouts.
