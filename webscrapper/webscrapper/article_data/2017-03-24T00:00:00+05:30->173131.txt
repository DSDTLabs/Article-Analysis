Some combinations work better together. 

 Even before the release of the much-anticipated movie  , its protagonist   and scriptwriter   have decided to team up again for a film directed by  .
 
  Arun had earlier told us that he was in talks with the scriptwriter to do a project, which will go on floors only after he completes his movie with Asif Ali and Murali Gopy in the lead. Now, Murali Gopy tells us that the duo have finalised Prithviraj as the lead for their upcoming project.
  “We had earlier discussed the theme and when we told the same to Prithviraj, he liked it and agreed to do it. I vibe well with Raju, so it’s comfortable working with him,” says Murali Gopy, who has also done the script for Dileep’s Kammarasambhavam.
 
 Arun and Murali had previously worked together in Ee Adutha Kaalathu and Left Right Left. “I have a creative camaraderie with Arun. I write my movies from a film editor’s perspective. I like to try different editing patterns for each of my films. And fortunately Arun can also relate to that,” says the scriptwriter-actor.
 
  On the genre of the upcoming Prithviraj film, Murali Gopy says, “I am someone who likes to hop genres. It will be something different from the previous movies I have done. If we compare the scripts Arun and I have worked with, each film was different and the subjects we choose keep getting more intense.”
 
  While Murali Gopy has collaborated with Arun before, it’s the first time he’s working with directors Jiyen Krishnakumar and Rathish Ambat for Tiyaan and Kammarasambhavam, respectively.
