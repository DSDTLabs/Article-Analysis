HYDERABAD: A day after an accused, Bheem Singh, died in   station under suspicious conditions, the autopsy report concluded Singh died of  . The post-mortem was conducted by forensic experts at   (OGH). However, family members said they are verifying   footage provided by police and alleged Bheem may have been attacked inside the Inspector's room where there was no CCTV coverage. 

 Late in the evening, the Hyderabad police too claimed in a press release that Bheem Singh had died of cardiac arrest and the autopsy was videographed.
 
 After   police was accused of custodial torture that triggered Singh's death, police on Sunday released footage of Bheem Singh strolling inside the police station, including video grabs of him collapsing inside the toilet. Minutes later, the video shows Bheem Singh lying unconscious on the floor.
 
 Singh was summoned to the police station at 11.55 am on Saturday for allegedly assaulting Dillip Bharathi in a drunken state. CCTV footage showed he was allowed to sit in the chair in the hall along with Birju Singh, an accused in another case.
 
 "During an inquiry, Singh was also allowed to talk to family members from a sub-inspector's phone. At 4.30 pm, he went to the toilet and did not come out for next 20 minutes. Another suspect, Birju Singh, who was seated with him wanted to use the toilet and found the door shut and informed cops. The door was forced open and he was found unconscious,'' said police. Forensic experts said barring an elbow injury, there were no wounds.
 
 However, residents of Dhoolpet who laid siege to Mangalhat police station on Saturday, are not buying claims of police and OGH doctors. They still suspect Singh died due to police torture.
 
 Local BJP MLA Raja Singh told TOI that family members are still verifying the video given by police. "Family members still doubt whether Bheem was beaten inside the inspector's cabin where there is no CCTV coverage," said Raja Singh.
