BHOPAL: Shifting from offline to online system of examinations,   will now lessen the burden of candidates appearing in the exam by reducing examination fees by almost 80%. Vyapam has decided to reduce examination fee charged from candidates and has in this regard sent a proposal to the state government. 

 A student is required to pay fees for buying the application forms and it was found that on an average, a candidate had to pay around Rs 250 excluding the fee of application form. Vyapam wants to bring it down to around Rs 100.
 
 When contacted, Vyapam's director Bhaskar Lakshakar said it will help students save their money at a big level. "We had made everything online since December 2015. Fee payments are also made online. As there is no paper work involved, Vyapam found that it i s better to reduce the fee," he said. Citing an example, he said, "For amending mistakes in application form Rs 50 was charged. As online facility was not available, the concerned department had to sort out the form and candidate was required to visit the campus for correction. With online facility, student can amend mistakes by logging through his application ID. So, we have found that Rs 20 is enough a charge for this purpose," said Lakshakar. 
 
 This has been implemented with immediate effect.
 
 Other fees like for amending mistakes through MP online (Rs 50), portal fee (Rs 70), online application from home will be also reduced. "We have sent a proposal to higher authorities to reduce such fee also. We want MP Online fee should be Rs 15 instead of Rs 50, and kiosk centre fee should be reduced to Rs 30 from Rs 70. Besides, fee for online application file from home should be reduced to Rs 20 from Rs 40," he said. Earlier, Vyapam had developed a software called '  (E-PAS)' to process results, with zero human intervention.
