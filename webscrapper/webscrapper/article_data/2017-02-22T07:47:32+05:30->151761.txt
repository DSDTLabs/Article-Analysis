KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday criticized   (VACB) for changing its   in tune with the change in the political party that is in power.

 Court is not the venue for VACB to play politics and the agency's stance in a case should not change when the government changes, the court said.
 VACB's political leaning came to be discussed by the court while considering a petition filed by former finance minister  , seeking to quash the bar bribery case, and another petition by Noble Mathew, seeking a CBI probe in the matter.
 
 While considering the matter earlier, the court had sought VACB's stance regarding a further probe and also about a CBI investigation. VACB took the stance that a further probe is required and that it is not in opposition to a directive for CBI probe. The court pointed out that VACB's earlier view was that a further probe is not required and that leaving the matter to CBI would adversely affect the case.
 
 VACB's stance in a case is changing in tune with the change in the government and officials and the change in government is affecting the agency's stances in cases being considered by the court, the bench said. The agency had recommended against a further   before the vigilance court and is now seeking a further probe before the high court, the judge said. The court then asked VACB to file a detailed statement in the matter within two weeks.
