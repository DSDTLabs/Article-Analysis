KOLKATA: All motor training schools in the city would have to follow a syllabus and manual set by IIT to train prospective drivers, stated a transport department notice issued on Wednesday. If any institute failed to follow the syllabus, it would lose its licence to operate.

 The transport department has over the year trained instructors at all the listed schools on how to follow the new syllabus. “We have fixed certain hours for classroom training and on-road practical training. The new syllabus is designed to ensure a motorist is confident to drive in various road conditions, that they learn all traffic signs, know how to start and stop a vehicle besides how to shift the gears. A prospective driver will also be taught basic maintenance,” said a senior transport official. The department has instructed to insure every training vehicle so that a learner is not burdened with the liability during an accident.
 
 After IIT prepared the training manual, the department asked for modification of certain sections to sync them with the Central Motor Vehicles Act. Now, the manual and the syllabus are of international standard. “But its efficacy will depend on how well it is being utilised at the motor training schools. We will keep tabs on the institutes,” the official said.
 
 Transport officials said they would advise every trainee to cross-check the terms and conditions before going in for enrolment. At the same time, the transport department has instructed the public vehicles department and RTOs to be extra vigilant regarding the tests. “We are trying to fix accountability of the motor vehicle officer granting licences. We do not want to certify a learner unless he/she is 100% road compatible,” said an official. “We have asked every RTO to take the test based on the new syllabus and under CCTV cameras.”
