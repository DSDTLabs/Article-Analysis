VADODARA: A five-year-old girl suffered severe injuries on her fingers that got stuck in the bench on the railway station on Tuesday. 

 Fire department officials had to rush to the station and rescue the wailing girl even as large crowd gathered there. 
 
 Shreyasi  , who was supposed to go to Pune from the city with her parents, was waiting with her mother in the waiting room on platform 1 of the railway station. While playing around in the waiting room, she accidentally got her fingers stuck in the bench. She called her mother   for help but she could not do much. The girl writhing in pain started crying profusely.
 
 A doctor with the railways came to help but he too could not help the girl whose fingers got swollen due to lack of blood supply. The doctors then advised her parents to take her to hospital so that she would not fall unconscious.
 
 However, taking the girl to the hospital was another hurdle as the bench was huge and it was fixed in the ground. The part of the bench in which Kesri’s fingers were stuck was eventually broken and removed from the ground. She was then taken to   in 108 GVK-EMRI ambulance along with the part of the bench.
 
 Initially the staff of 108 emergency services tried to cut the bench using pliers but in vain. “By then I had reached there with the fire staff and we asked them to allow us since we are trained to use the tools. We started to cut the bench from its end and subsequently bent the part until the fingers were removed,” said I I Sheikh, fire officer,   fire station.
