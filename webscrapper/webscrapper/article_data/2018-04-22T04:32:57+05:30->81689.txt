MUMBAI: Convicted gangster Abu   will have to shelve his marriage plans as the Konkan divisional commissioner has rejected his plea for 45-day parole. Salem, 49, had fixed May 5 as the date to marry 27-year-old Mumbra resident  .

 Since Salem’s residential address was given as Mumbra, the divisional commissioner sought a report from Thane police which submitted an adverse report. Based on this, the divisional commissioner on Thursday rejected his parole plea. It is learnt Salem, who is currently lodged in Taloja jail, had applied for parole in February.
 
 “Since there are pending cases against Salem, he cannot be given parole. Four cases, including a   case, are pending in New Delhi against him, besides several other cases,” said a jail official.
 
 Salem had claimed he had married Bahar “over the phone” during a train journey, when he was being taken to Lucknow for a court hearing a few years ago.
 
 Bahar later filed an application in court saying since her name was splashed in the media, no one else would marry her and, hence, she should be allowed to tie the knot with Salem. She had even threatened suicide if she was not allowed to do so.
 
 “Salem has the option of appealing before the state government. But chances of getting parole are low since the state will also look into the ‘rejection of parole application’ and review security issues as well,” said a jail officer.
 
 Salem was first arrested by the Lisbon police in 2002 along with girlfriend and starlet,  . The duo was extradited to India in November 2005.
 
 In 2017, Salem was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts cases. In 2015, he was awarded life sentence for the murder of builder Pradeep Jain. Jain was shot dead outside his Juhu bungalow on March 7, 1995.
