Last weekend, when   turned up on the sets of the ' ' sequel to reprise his roles of the original twins, Raja and Prem, he was welcomed with open arms by not just the new 'Judwaa'  , but this young boy. 

  
  
 
 Subhan is a sometime-assistant on the sets, helping out during vacations, and the darling of the unit, and that includes Bhai himself who has seen him since the day he was born.
 
 The 15-year-old is the son of the film's producer  , but has opted to learn the ropes at the grassroots. Those who know him well, are not surprised because despite his family background, he has no airs. 
 
 And while he hasn't figured out his future yet, many see a star in him given that he has happy feet, martial arts skills, a gym-chiselled body and a charm in plenty. According to a source, Varun was heard joking, "Subhan you could be the Raja and Prem of 'Judwaa 3'".
 
 Papa Sajid and mamma Wardha won't be drawn into any discussions about Subhan's star trek yet, but if he does slip into Sallu and Varun's shoes, you'll know where you heard it first.
