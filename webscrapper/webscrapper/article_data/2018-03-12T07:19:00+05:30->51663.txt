Ludhiana: Atam Nagar MLA and Lok Insaf Party (LIP) leader Simarjeet Bains on Sunday, launched a scathing attack on the Congress government over the Job Fair. Bains, addresing the media here on Sunday, alleged that contractual and permanent employees of cooperatives societies and others, who were already employed for the last four to five years were given job letters in the Job Fair organised in Ludhiana on Sunday. He added he has a list of employees and their bank statements which indicate they have been drawing salaries for the last many years.

 The LIP leader also alleged that the secretary, Cooperatives Department had issued orders to cooperatives to send all contractual and permanent employees to the Job Fair to get the job letters. He asked the CM to release the list of those who got government jobs during the last one year as promised by him during the polls. 
 
 Bains said they would raise these questions during the budget session and asked the chief minister to stop this “drama”. He also asked the CM about his promises to hike pension to Rs 2,500, ending drug mafia and illegal sand mining and others.
 
 The MLA alleged that the aerial survey of sand mining by Amarinder was a drama to target his foes within the party. 
 
 Bains also took on the ‘Poll Khol Rally’ of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), calling it a farce to divert people’s attention from the real issues. The LIP leader said, “There is a need to do a ‘Poll Khol’ of the relationship between chief minister Amarinder Singh and Sukhbir Singh Badal and also between Akali Dal, BJP and Congress. There is no difference between BJP and SAD’s ten-year rule and that of Congress’s one year regime.”
