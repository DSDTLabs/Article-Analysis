AHMEDABAD: In an apparent U-turn, the Central University of   (CUG) said that it has “closed the matter” over nine of its faculty members being accused of canvassing for political parties like the Congress, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and Congress   Alpesh Thakore, in the run-up to the Gujarat assembly elections in 2017. All nine faculty members were told “...the university has accepted your explanation and the matter stands closed”.

 The faculty members, however, will not let the matter slide so easily. The president of the CUG teachers’ association, Dr Sony Kunjappan, told TOI, “The whole matter is illegal, as the show-cause notice was issued illegally, targeting a few teachers. We want the university to first withdraw the show-cause notices issued to the nine teachers, not to just close the matter.” 
 
 The association also officially stated that if the university fails to do so, the teachers will have no option but to approach the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD). “We will ask the MHRD to look into the misuse of office by the CUG administration,” said Kunjappan. The association has demanded an inquiry committee, which should include the local MLA, if the CUG fails to withdraw the notices. 
 
 On April 20, the CUG issued show-cause notices to these faculty members after receiving a complaint from ABVP — the student wing of the RSS. The complaint said that the professors had attended a public meeting of   president Rahul Gandhi in Ahmedabad on November 24, 2017. However, senior faculty members at CUG said the controversy was rooted in an academic council meeting in March 2018. At the meeting, a few senior professors protested against colleagues who were holding statutory administrative positions — such as registrar, the comptroller of exams and chief finance officer — instead of concentrating on research and academic activities.
