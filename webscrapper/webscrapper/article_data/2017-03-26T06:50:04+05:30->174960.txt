BENGALURU: Efforts to revive   may become a multi-national endeavour if a proposal bears fruit. Representatives of the UK-based Blue Water Bio and officials of the Israel-based Tahal Group visited the lake on Friday.

 The companies have proposed a Rs 4,000-crore project to revive the lake. According to the proposal, the sewage and drain water flowing into the waterbody will be intercepted at the entry point and diverted to the lake's periphery. The water will then be subjected to natural treatment and supplemented by wetland purification, after which it'll be allowed to enter the lakebed. Water from Bellandur Lake will flow through Yamalur and Bellandur weirs to Varthur Lake, where it'll again undergo natural treatment, ultra-fil tration and reverse osmosis so that it can be sent for reuse.
 
 While   has offered to provide technology and finance solutions, Tahal will execute the project. “Nothing has been finalized.This is only a preliminary exercise. The work will start after tenders are issued in ac cordance with the   Transparency in Public Procurement Act,“ industries minister   said.
 
 Blue Water Bio officials told Deshpande the UK government had in principle agreed to extend financial assistance and was willing to lend 85% of the project cost. He, however, expressed concerns over the idea of getting aid from the UK government, for which India has to enter a government-to-government agreement. “It will be a timeconsuming process. We will explore alternatives,“ he said.
 
 KSIIDC will be the nodal agency, said its chairman C M   said.
