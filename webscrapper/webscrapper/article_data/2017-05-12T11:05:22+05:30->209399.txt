JALANDHAR: Finding an ambulance beyond his means, a man working in a hockey-stick manufacturing unit put his father's body on a pushcart at the Civil Hospital,  , on Thursday evening.   said his father Lal Singh had been admitted to the   on May 7, after suffering a stroke. He died on Thursday. “I asked a private ambulance parked at the hospital. The driver demanded Rs 400 for a distance of just 4 km. I had only Rs 150 with me,“ he told TOI.

 The family lives at Krishna Nagar. A relative came to his aid by bringing a pushcart on which fruits and vegetables are sold. Many people gathered on seeing the body lying on a pushcart. Outside the hospital gate, an auto-rickshaw driver said he would take the body in his vehicle. Sarabjit then took the body home in the auto.
 
 Medical superintendent KS Bawa of the Civil Hospital said the ambulance service at the hospital can only be used to transport patients,­ it cannot be used as a hearse.
 
 In August last year, the nation was shocked by images of Dana Majhi, a tribal who lost his wife to tuberculosis, carrying the body on his shoulder for 10 km, accompanied by his 12-year-old daughter.
 
 A month later, after his 65-year-old mother died at the Jajpur district hospital in  , the tribal Gunu Tirika loaded the body onto a cycle rickshaw and pedalled home.
