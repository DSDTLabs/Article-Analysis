LUCKNOW: He started out in 2006, intent on making it big. Resident of Hasiyamau in Thakurganj,   started his career as a property agent. As prices   were escalating around that period, Aqeel started dealing in disputed properties.

  But before that, he made good connections with local police, particularly with cops at Balaganj police outpost. Locals say that such was his clout that cops at the outpost would rush in and support Aqeel openly whenever he was in middle of a clash or dispute.
 
 As his clout grew, so did his aggression. By 2010, Aqeel had been booked twice for attacking rivals. And now, a total of   are pending against him,  , robbery, riot, causing grievous hurt to attempt to murder and other charges. Shravan Sahu’s murder has laid bare city police’s failure in taking preventive measures against a listed criminal who was booked under Gangster Act in 2014 after he had murdered Ayush Sahu.
 
 On October 16, 2013, Aqeel had allegedly killed Ayush at Campbell road in Thakurganj. Aqeel and Ayush wanted the same beer brand and only bottle of the same was left at the shop. Ayush reportedly refused to bow down before the local goon in his stronghold and paid with his life. Aqeel surrendered before sub-inspector Anurag Upadhyay three days later and was sent to jail.
 
 He remained behind bars till September 2016 but was granted bail on September 12 last year. Within weeks of coming out, Aqeel was back in business. He bashed up some lower caste rivals on Ring Road and an FIR was registered against him at Thakurganj police station in October for rioting, violence and criminal intimidation.
 
 “Some policeman have a tendency to give shelter to Aqeel and his likes so that they can be used. Aqeel’s rise shows that he has become stronger only with khaki’s support,” said high court advocate Rohit Kant.
