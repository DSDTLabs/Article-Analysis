Chandigarh: Janchetna, a university club launched a three-day book   by at the Panjab University student centre.

 The book exhibition displays books in Punjabi, Hindi and English languages.
 
 The books are based on various social and political themes.
 
 Novels by various Indian and foreign authors like Paash, Premchand, Tagore, Maxim Gorky and Emile Zola were also showcased.
 
 The main attraction of the exhibition is the works of Bhagat Singh and his comrades in Hindi as well as poetry collection of revolutionary Punjabi poet Paash titled 'Sabh ton Khatarnak'.
 
 A reference in his poem has been garnering controversy as RSS ideologue Dina Nath Batra recommended the poem to be removed from NCERT.
 
 Sikandar, one of the volunteers present at the stall said, “We want to promote progressive literature among the youth. For this purpose we frequently organize such book-exhibitions in the campus of various colleges in the city. This time we will also organize department-wise book exhibitions so that we can reach out to more students.”
