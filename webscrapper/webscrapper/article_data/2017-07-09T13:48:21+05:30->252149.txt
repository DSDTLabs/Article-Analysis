MADURAI: Safety match manufacturers in southern Tamil Nadu have decided to call off their seven-day-old strike and commence production from Monday. 

 The decision was taken after a meeting on Friday evening where the manufacturers were assured by local minister Kadambur Raju and the state government that the   council would be informed of their livelihood loss.
 
 There are more than 300 match-making units at Kovilpatti in   district, Sattur, Virudhunagar, Sivakasi in   district and Sankarankovil in Tirunelveli district. Nearly Rs 40 crore business was lost in last 7 days when 3 lakh workers depending on the industry went without livelihood due to the strike. 
 
 Under the goods and services tax, handmade safety matches are levied 5 % while semi-mechanised and fully mechanised safety match units are clubbed together and levied 18 %. 
 
 Earlier, there was no tax on handmade units and 5 % VAT was applicable only if they were exporting it to other states. Semi-mechanised units were levied 6 % excise duty and 5 % VAT while fully mechanised units were paying 12 % excise duty, 2 % Central Sales Tax and 5 % VAT. 
 
 Since a majority of safety match manufacturing units was semi-mechanised (mechanising part of production and handling rest of production using labourers), the manufacturers associations have strongly opposed clubbing both mechanised and semi-mechanised units under the same slab of 18 % GST. 
 
 Vice-president of National Small Match Manufacturers Association at Kovilpatti, T Raju, said that they were withdrawing the strike temporarily considering the huge loss to industry and plight of workers having to go without wages for a week. 
 
 “A team from commercial department is visiting the region on Sunday where we will express our concern on GST. State government and our local minister Kadambur Raju have promised to take up the issue with the Union government. So we are hopeful that there will be some respite”, he said.
