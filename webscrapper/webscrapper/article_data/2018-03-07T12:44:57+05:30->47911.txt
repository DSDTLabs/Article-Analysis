Wondering how even survey   of land too were made to play a mischievous role in the indiscriminate and hitech   in East Godavari district, the Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday stayed the sand mining in   village of Sitanagaram mandal in East Godavari district.

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice K   pronounced this interim order while hearing a public interest petition that charged the authorities with conniving with sand miners and allowing them to mine at areas that are unconnected to their leasehold areas. 
 
 In the last hearing, the bench had asked petitioner’s counsel N Sridhar Reddy to deposit Rs 50,000 for his allegations to be verified by a district judge. The petitioner’s allegation is that the sand miners got lease for mining in Survey number 205/1 but were mining elsewhere in the village. The bench directed a district judge to get the matter verified. On Tuesday, the bench heard the matter again with the help of the district judge report which said that the emergence of survey number 205/1 is a recent development and the reasons for the same are yet to be traced. 
 
 This survey number was not there in Vangalapudi village in the past. It was added recently. The village map too shows it as a recent phenomenon. Excavation is going on in Survey number 2. It is not known as of now whether this survey number 205/1 and survey number 2 are one and the same, the bench said. Sridhar Reddy referred to a 2017 report of tehsildar which conclusively said that the mining was being done in 205/1 and wondered how the revenue officer so conclusively said about a survey number whose existence is in doubt even today. 
 
 The state counsel said that the petitioner has to wait till the ongoing inquiry on the survey numbers is concluded. The bench stayed the sand quarrying in the area and posted the case to three weeks for further hearing.
