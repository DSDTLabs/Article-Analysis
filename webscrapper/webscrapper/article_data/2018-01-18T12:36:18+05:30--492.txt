Former   Ganga   has moved the petition on the ground that the additional reservation of 5% to the OBCs under the most backward classes the reservation in the state had reached 54% which was a violation of the Supreme Court order which puts a cap on reservation at 50%.
 
 The court had later stayed the additional reservation provided under the Backward Classes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions in the State and of Appointment and Posts in Services under the State) Bill, 2017.
