Bollywood actor   has been on the receiving end on social networking platforms for allegedly ‘bullying’   – the daughter of an Indian Army martyr. The actor found himself being dragged into the eye of the storm after applauding a tweet by  , which saw the cricketer taking a jibe at Kaur for her recent post that had her holding a placard that said, “Pakistan did not kill my father. War did!”

 
 
 The Indian cricketer later shared a picture of himself posing in a manner similar to Kaur’s, with a message on a placard that read, “I didn’t score two triple centuries, my bat did.” The post, which is believed to have tickled Randeep’s funnybone, earned an applause from the actor. Soon, Randeep and Sehwag were referred to as ‘bullies’ by social media users and were bashed for being insensitive towards the martyr’s daughter. 
 
 Randeep took to Facebook on Monday to clarify his stance saying that he wasn’t being insensitive to the daughter of a soldier, who gave his life for the country. He further defended himself saying that standing up for Sehwag was not a justification of the violence that broke outside Ramjas College.
