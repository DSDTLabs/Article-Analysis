NAGPUR: The government should increase the allocation to science and technology by at least 2% as well as make target and result-oriented, product based-research the norm for all national R & D institutions and universities. 

 This was the opinion of former scientists, teachers, technologists TOI spoke to.
 
 Satish Wate, a former Neeri director, said that there should be a budget provision for already-established technologies for their field applications. “Budget for R & D should remain unchanged but with a condition that society benefit from the funds used by institutions be more visible,” he added. 
 
 PD Majumdar, former adviser to DST and  , said, “The problem is with the execution of allocations. A majority of funds is surrendered annually unutilized due to lack of time-bound, result-oriented and mission-mode projects with applicability to the user.”
 
 Vilas Sapre, former head of the university physics department, said that it was sad the schools, colleges as well as “our universities are not inclined or oriented for research”. “There is a need developing research culture right from schools to national laboratories,” he said.
 
 Amit Majumdar, former regional director of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, too wants enough funds for allocations. “We have enough nuclear fuel for energy generation. More allocations should be given for rare earth metals exploration,” he said.
 
 The director of city-based   and Design Centre, Anupam Agnihotri said that India’s gross expenditure on R & D has been less than 1% as compared to USA and South Korea which spend 2.70% and 3.36%, respectively.
 
 “There should be motivation and stimulation for private sector to invest in R & D. PSUs should also be encouraged to invest at least 1% of their total turnover rather than just 1% of the profit after tax. Government should think of levying cess on basic raw material in the name of clean technology,” said Majumdar.
