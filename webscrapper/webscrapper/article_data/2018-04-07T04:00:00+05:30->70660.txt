Nagpur: In a relief for Saoner MLA Sunil Kedar, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday rejected a petition challenging his win in the 2014 Maharashtra assembly polls. A single-judge bench of justice Ravi Deshpande dismissed a plea filed by Sonba Musle, who had contested the poll on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket.

 The court observed that Musle was disqualified on the date of his nomination, as he was working as government contractor. It also refused to consider petitioner’s resignation letter stating that it didn’t inspire any confidence. The case was closed for order on December 15.
 
 Musle, through counsel Firdos Mirza, had contended that he had filed his nomination for polls on September 27, 2014. Manish Mohod, a resident of Malegaon, complained that he was not qualified to contest the legislative assembly polls under Section 9A of the People’s Representation Act, as he was a government contractor. After hearing, the Election Commission ruled that the People’s Representation Act was applicable to petitioner and rejected his nomination papers, which he challenged in HC. He also challenged Kedar’s victory in polls claiming it to invalid, in view of the rejection of his nomination.
