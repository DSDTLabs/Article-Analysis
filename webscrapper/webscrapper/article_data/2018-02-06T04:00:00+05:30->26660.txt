Mumbai: The   (LTCG) tax scare from the   proposals, combined with a global selloff due to rising borrowing costs, took a toll on Dalal Street on Monday. The   closed 310 points lower at 34,757, which is nearly a four-week closing low for the benchmark. In the last three sessions since the Budget was announced, which imposed a 10% tax on annual   of more than Rs 1 lakh, the sensex has lost about 1,200 points (3.3%).

 At the end of Monday’s session, investors’ were left poorer by about Rs 70,000 crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 153 lakh crore. Since the day Budget was announced on February 1, BSE’s market capitalisation has dipped by Rs 5.6 lakh crore.
 
 Other than the domestic factor, market players said that the rising global yield is also affecting investor sentiment around the world. On Monday, the US 10-year treasury yield hit a recent high at 2.86% per annum, which led to a selloff in some of the major Asian markets. In the US, the recent rise in treasury yields led to a 666-point slide in the Dow Jones index on Friday. One of the reasons for the rise in yields in the world’s largest economy has been strong market expectation that in 2018, the US central bank may raise rates at least four times, compared to the earlier expectation of three rate hikes, news reports said.
 
 Given the global market scenario, foreign funds have started taking money out of India with Monday’s net selling figure at Rs 1,264 crore. Domestic funds, on the other hand, recorded a net buying figure of Rs 1,164 crore. The foreign fund selling is taking a toll on the strength of the Indian currency, too, with the rupee now at 64.07 a dollar compared with 63.59 the day before the Budget. Among the Asian markets,   in Japan closed 2.6% lower while in late session FTSE in UK was down over 1%. In early trades in the US on Monday, Dow Jones was down 0.4% while S&P 500 was almost flat. 
 
 In the Indian market too, bond prices rose with the benchmark 10-year gilt yield closing at 7.60%, up 43 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) in exactly a month since it was issued at 7.17%.
