PUNE:   (IGP)   has initiated an internal inquiry against the   rural police for their alleged failure to take immediate action in the attack on a group of   at   on the night of December 31.

 Speaking to TOI,   said, “A thorough inquiry will be carried out to find out why action was not taken.” 
 
 A woman fitness trainer in the trekking group had contacted Nangre-Patil, accusing the Lonavla police of displaying a “lackadaisical attitude” towards their remonstrations over the attack. “The woman somehow got in touch with me. I then directed the additional superintendent of police to look into the case,” Nangre-Patil said.
 
 The nine suspects were produced before a local court and remanded in police custody till Friday.
 
 Assistant police inspector   of the Lonavla rural police told TOI, “The suspects told us that the trekkers were consuming liquor at the fort. They said they told the trekkers to follow the traditions and customs that are observed at the fort. This, they claimed, led to an altercation and later an ugly fight.”
 
 Yede said the police would check the background of the suspects and find out how they came together in a group. 
 
 In 2014, the rural police had issued a special order banning trekking at Rajmachi fort and other areas in Lonavla between midnight and 4 am. The step was taken following incidents where trekkers were either targeted by robbers or attacked by wild animals. The police had also given permission to the forest and archaeology departmetns to install checkposts at the entry and exit of such trekking spots.
