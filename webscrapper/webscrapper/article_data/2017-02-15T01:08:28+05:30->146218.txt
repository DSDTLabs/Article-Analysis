NAVI MUMBAI: The Rs 16,000-crore Navi Mumbai International Airport project was finally awarded to  , but   had to tweak the   to encourage more bidders by relaxing the tender norms. In the past, Cidco twice faced a dilemma with just one bidder (GVK-led MIAL).

 The changes were made after the second extension on January 25. On Monday, GMR was the only other bidder with GVK.
 
 Cidco MD Bhushan Gaghrani described it as “clarification”, while GMR Airports president (finance and business development) Siddharth Kapur said, “We bid because of the relaxations made by Cidco.” 
 
 The project cost was redefined to make it less risky for banks in case of midway termination of project. Freedom of the strategic partner to operate the airport to appoint its CEO and CFO without Cidco nod was also allowed, besides deferring payment of soft loan on the money being spent by Cidco on pre-development works to date of project completion. Earlier, it was from the date of appointment of the strategic partner.
