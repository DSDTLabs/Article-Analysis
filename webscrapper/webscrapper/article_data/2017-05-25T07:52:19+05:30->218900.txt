RANCHI: A pack of   in   on the   causing the residents of the area to   

 Besides barging into kitchens and stealing food and fruits, the monkeys created a terror to the residents by swooping down on people and going to the extent of biting them.
 
 On Monday, Pintu Sharma a garage mechanic was heading to work on a bicycle around 10:30am. He barely crossed the temple at Lowadih chowk when three monkeys jumped in front of him. One of them hurled itself on Sharma and dug its teeth into his arm. 
 
 "I was playing with my friends when around two to three monkeys descended from a nearby tree. They started chasing us. I fell to the ground and one of them caught on to me and bit my leg and ran away," Manish Dubey, a nine-year-old school student who was playing on a playground next to his house on Sunday evening, said. 
 
 Namkum is no stranger to monkey menace. Last year, a bunch of monkeys descended to the town from the nearby forest patches. "They usually come here for food and water as water bodies dry up and there is nothing much to eat. The monkeys are usually fed at the temple premises by the locals. But this year, the monkeys are running into conflicts with humans," Awadesh Pandey, a local resident said. 
 
 Nitesh Oraon, a college student, was bit by a monkey on Wednesday morning and was rushed to the Ranchi district hospital at noon. "We have had roughly 10 cases of monkey bites in the past week, all of them from Namkum and its adjoining area," P. Banerjee, on-duty doctor at Sadar out patient department said. 
 
 The locals complained about inertness from the forest officials. Ranchi ranger, Abha Singh however said, "We are not aware of such incidents. However, we will now look into it and take all necessary steps."
