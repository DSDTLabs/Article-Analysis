MUMBAI: The   (QCI) on July 6 declared the city ‘open defecation-free’ (ODF), and on Friday chief minister   even sent Mumbaikars and the   a congratulatory tweet. Mumbai reacted almost entirely in anger, calling the claim hollow, and Fadnavis got trolled all through Friday evening. 

  
  
 
 King Circle resident Nikhil Desai said: “It (ODF status) is a lie.”
 
 Officials said the criteria for declaring a city ODF are that there should be a   within 500 metres of every household, people living there should know there is a toilet, and if they still defecate in the open, they must be penalized.
