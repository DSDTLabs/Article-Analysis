New Delhi: Running into rough weather over allowing a ‘yajna’ to be held on campus on Saturday, a defiant   of state-run Indian Institute of Mass Communications,  , said he did not need lessons in secularism from outsiders. 

 “Because of the ritual, there was talk that secularism of the country was in danger. But fools have to know that in the past, we had accommodated all religions in the country,” Suresh said on Saturday. The   director general also said lighting of lamps in events, performing the ‘bhoomi pooja’ etc happened everywhere. Suresh also said Muslims can perform the Namaz, and Sikhs can also conduct their rituals on the campus.
 
 He also rubbished criticism over his decision to invite controversial top cop and former Bastar IGP S R P Kalluri to address the media seminar on Saturday. Kalluri, upon his arrival amidst student protests, struck a combative note. He said he was willing to take on “Delhi intellectuals” over the “wrong” perception of Bastar they had perpetuated. “We will take them to Bastar to show them the reality,” he said. The former top cop has been accused of human rights violations, and of targeting rights activists, lawyers and journalists after he took charge as Bastar IG in June 2014. 
 
 Even while students and faculty members from IIMC and neighbouring JNU protested against Kalluri’s presence on IIMC campus, Suresh said he did not see why he should deny Kalluri entry. “He is coming to the event amid press people, and they will question him,” Suresh said.
