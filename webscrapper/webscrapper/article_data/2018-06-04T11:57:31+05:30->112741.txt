CHENNAI: Volunteers from the Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) collected 16.83 tonnes of plastic waste during a garbage cleaning drive from beaches and lakes in four locations across Tamil Nadu on Sunday, to mark the upcoming World Environment Day (June 5). 

 According to EFI, as many as 2,000 community volunteers participated in the drive held in Chennai, Coimbatore, Rameswaram and   and picked up trash between 7 and 9am.
 
 A statement from EFI said that the drive was held at the Foreshore Estate beach besides Thiruvanmiyur, Palavakkam and Injambakkam beaches as well as the Elliot's Beach near Ashtalakshmi temple in Besant Nagar in Chennai. Volunteers also cleared trash from the Mamallapuram beach, the statement said. Chennai lakes that the volunteers cleaned include Nanmangalam Eri, Mudichur Seekana Eri, Karasangal, Kazhipattur and Madambakkam lakes.
 
 In Coimbatore, the drive covered Krishnampatty lake while in Puducherry, volunteers rid the Nallavadu beach of plastic waste. Trash was removed at the Rameswaram beach too. The cleanup was part of EFI's "For a starter volunteer for water" campaign.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Arun Krishnamurthy, founder EFI said, "Collaborative conservation was on display during the cleanup and it is here to continue in the weeks ahead. We must understand that water bodies are not trash yards and come together as citizens to reclaim them," he said. Nandhini Arun, communication associate, EFI, told TOI that the volunteers collected 16.83 tonnes of plastic waste during the Sunday drive. 
 
 Volunteers, some of whom were participating for the first time in a cleanup, told TOI that they were amazed at the amount of trash they found on beaches. 
 
 "I never imagined that I would find so many discarded balloons on the beach. I ended up picking only balloons for almost an hour at the Besant Nagar beach," said Rama Narayanan, a volunteer.
