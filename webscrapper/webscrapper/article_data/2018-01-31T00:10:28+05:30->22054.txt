   were left in no doubt that they were the better team and were unlucky not to get anything out of their   clash against Neroca FC at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Tuesday.
 
  Churchill Bros lost 0-1, the first defeat this year, and comes on the back of a strong run that saw them pick up 10 points from their last four matches. The defeat has halted their climb up the ladder, and club patron   believes they were at the wrong end of the refereeing decisions.
  
  “I can’t understand why we are always at the receiving end of bad refereeing decisions. Just look at the goal that we conceded (from a penalty). It was unfair. Even if the referee believed that the penalty was genuine, despite the faintest of touch, how could we be denied at least three penalties,” asked Alemao, who now occupies the technical bench.
  
  The loss has left Churchill Brothers in 10th place, the same as Chennai City FC, who they are certain to jostle to save the drop. Churchill, however, have two matches in hand and will look to recover lost ground against leaders Minerva Punjab FC in the next home clash on Friday. “We have a good team now, capable of defeating any team in the league. The foreign players and additions have strengthened the team,” said Alemao.
