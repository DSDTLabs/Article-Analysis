After a year’s gap, the Pillur dam in Coimbatore district reached close to its full level on Sunday, forcing officials to release a bulk of the inflow into the   river.

 Simultaneously, a   alert was issued for people living along the Bhavani as shutters of the dam were opened in the morning. Water level in the dam reached 91 feet against its full level of 100 feet on Saturday night. But on Sunday morning the level rose steadily, aided by heavy rain in the catchment areas, to 98 ft.
 
 As the level inched closer to its capacity at 11 am, PWD officials held discussions with collector T N Hariharan and released 20,000 cusecs of water. Wayside villages were alerted about the release and people living close to the banks were asked to move to safer locations.
 
 “On Saturday night, the level was not dangerous. But 83mm of rain was recorded on Sunday morning, so we decided to release the water. The villagers, tahsildhars, village administrative officers, fire and rescue personnel and police officials were informed about the move. As it takes two hours for the water to reach downstream, everyone was prepared and there was no accident,” said assistant executive engineer Kanakaraj. TNN
