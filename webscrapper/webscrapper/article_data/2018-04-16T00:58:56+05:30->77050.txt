NEW DELHI: The   (AIIMS) has   a   of   from   for the next three years. The professor was accused of   by one of her   recently.

 
 The victim attempted suicide at his residence in Gautam Nagar by overdosing on drugs on March 25, triggering protests on the campus last month.
 
 “All students doing PhD theses under the professor have been shifted to other faculty members. The professor will not be guiding any student for the next three years,” said a senior doctor at AIIMS. Notably, in his letter to AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, the fifth-year student alleged that he was being mentally harassed and humiliated by the supervisor under whom he got registered in August 2013.
 
 “I have been under constant mental harassment and humiliation. She has time and again used filthy and abusive language in front of everyone. She scolds even when the work is done correctly.
 
 “My mental harassment is aggravated as she is not able to procure appropriate facilities, funds in the lab and makes no attempt to get the things done...my fellowship is delayed and this puts me in additional financial problem and mental burden,” the student alleged in the letter.
 
 He also claimed that some students, who are also undergoing PhD under the same guide, have contracted TB while working in the lab due to lack of proper equipment and personal protective accessories given to them.
 
 AIIMS is also learnt to have issued instructions to all supervisors in the department to implement safety measures and infrastructure for the laboratory staff.
 
 To avoid such incidences in future, officials added, a team of experts and teachers is being formed who can help and guide students in stress, the official added.
