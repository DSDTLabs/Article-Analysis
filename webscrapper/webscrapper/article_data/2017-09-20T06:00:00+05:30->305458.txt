Kolkata: Rakesh Kumar, a health inspector at the Ranchi railway station, was among five railway employees felicitated by South Eastern Railway (SER) general manager S N Agrawal in Kolkata on Monday for his dedication towards duty. 

 On September 6 this year, Kumar was assaulted with a rifle butt and shot at by the bodyguard of a former Jharkhand minister during a cleanliness drive at Ranchi station.
 
 “Kumar was asking passengers not to litter or throw garbage on the platform or tracks. He even hauled up a few passengers who were dumping rubbish and urged them to use dustbins. Among those littering was Vijay Kumar Rajak and he lost his cool after being told to use the dustbin. 
 
 Rajak was an armed policeman and threatened Kumar but he stood his ground. After a verbal altercation, Rajak unslung his rifle and smashed the butt on Kumar’s head. When he attempted to repeat the act, Kumar retreated towards the Government Railway Police (GRP) station. This was when Rajak fired a round that missed the health inspector narrowly,” said Sanjoy Ghosh, CPRO, SER. GRP personnel rushed out on hearing the shot and nabbed Rajak before he could do any more damage. During investigation, it came to be known that he was to board the Ranchi-New Delhi Rajdhani Express as a bodyguard to former minister Baidyanath Ram who also the MLA from Latehar. 
 
 Rajak was arrested and placed under suspension.
