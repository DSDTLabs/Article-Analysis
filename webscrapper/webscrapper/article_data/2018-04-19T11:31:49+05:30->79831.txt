 So bad was the situation that students and youngsters rued that their day-today expense management had gone haywire because of the cash crisis.  , an engineering student, made no bones about how the common man on the street is feeling right now on the mess created by the banks and government. “The government needs to realise that a large part of the country still runs on cash. I was not able to park my motorbike in a couple of places right from morning because I had no cash.”
 
 
 Lambasting the authorities, he said: “We can’t believe that the   government is still ascertaining the reasons for the crisis. It is high time they came up with a permanent solution to this.”
 
 While there were reports of people collapsing at ATMs and in queue lines like it happened after demonetization in 2016, there is no ignoring the fact that it has become a nightmare for the poor and the middle class.  , a small vegetable seller of  , was panicking on Monday evening as he was unable to repay one of the vendors who was in dire need of cash.
 
 “We only deal with cash. We do not know how to use computers or mobile phones. I do not know how I am going to repay the money I took from the vendor or buy vegetables,” he lamented. I cannot feed my family without the money I get from selling vegetables,” he explained.
 
 Bankers blamed it on inadequate supply of cash and seasonal rise in demand. “Not every ATM is recalibrated to accept Rs 200 notes, while Rs 2,000 notes are in short supply. Also, RBI has not been meeting the demand for cash. Hence, the banks are not able to fill the ATMs,” a senior banker said.
