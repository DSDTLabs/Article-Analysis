MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court adjourned a public interest litigation challenging the appointment of P P Chelladurai as vice-chancellor (VC) of the   (MKU) to Wednesday. 

 The PIL filed by Lionel M Anthony Arulraj came up for admission before the division bench of justices   and   on Tuesday. T
 
 he petitioner said that the present VC is not entitled to hold the post of VC for want of basic minimum qualification of 10 years of experience as professor. 
 
 The government constituted a search committee to recommend a panel of three names to the governor to appoint a VC to the MKU. The committee, headed by C   did not have a serious debate over the candidates or consideration of their applications. 
 
 The VC suppressed the fact that he is an accused in a criminal case. If the search committee or the chancellor had considered such criminal complaint against the present VC Chelladurai, they would not have come to the decision to empanel and to select him.
 
 The petitioner further stated that the VC had given many misleading information regarding his qualification to the search committee which too did not verify the information. Now the VC has started making appointments through illegal means. 
 
 Hence, it was necessary to restrain the VC from making new appointments to the university, the petitioner said and prayed to quash the appointment of Chelladuraiâ€™s appointment of VC to MKU.
