She is a part of an Anti-Snatching Unit set up by the west district to nab such criminals who have been duping people in similar ways across the city. 

 Vijay Kumar, DCP (west), said that a team consisting of around 10 police officials is constituted in every police station as well as at the district level. 
 
 Police said that they had laid a trap in order to lure these criminals, as they had been creating a menace in the area and had targeted women previously. “I wore fake gold bangles and a heavy chain, so that I could be noticed from a distance as well. At around 7pm, my colleagues and I were in position. After standing there for an hour, two men came speeding on a bike and slowed down in front of me,” said the official.
 
 The two men, later identified as Ramnath Mehto and Mukti Mehto, pretended like they wanted help and asked the woman if she knew any place where they could deposit the money they had been carrying. They said they were afraid someone might snatch their bag containing cash.
 
 The brothers then told the woman that they were carrying Rs 2 lakh and would give the same to her if she gave them the jewellery she was wearing. Kamla agreed and in return, they handed her over the bag containing cash. When checked later, they had placed a Rs 2,000 note on top of a bundle of white paper.
