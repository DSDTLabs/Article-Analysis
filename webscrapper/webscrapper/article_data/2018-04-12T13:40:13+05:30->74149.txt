TIRUPUR: Following a complaint from a group of farmers near   area that a textile garment washing unit was releasing effluent into unused borewells, the   ( ) officials inspected the unit on Wednesday in the presence of complainants. 

 The officials have taken water samples from four unused borewells and a farm well for further test. However, a senior TNPCB official said the possibility of environmental violations was remote. But the villagers alleged that there could be violations as groundwater in the area was severely polluted.
 
 According to a source in the TNPCB, the washing unit was functioning at   near Perumanllur for over four years. It had obtained licence for washing dyed fabric or garments and installed effluent treatment plant with a capacity of 15,000 litres a day
 
 Earlier, the farmers submitted a petition before the district administration and Tirupur north division TNPCB alleging that the unit was buying about 40,000 litres of water and when asked about the output/utilization of the same, there was no answer. 
 
 They suspect that the unit could release the effluent water into dry borewells. “In many borewells, total dissolved solid (TDS) level has gone up or doubled over the months. Due to high salinity, we stopped consuming the groundwater or giving it to cattle,” said S Senthil Kumar, a farmer, who was present during the inspection.
 
 “There are a few dry borewells which could be accessed easily by the unit. The water samples taken from one of them seemed polluted. Moreover, a farm well which remained dry for many years was found with water,” Senthil added.
 
 Ruling out possibility for the environmental violations, the senior TNPCB official said, “The washing unit could not use effluent. Moreover, during the inspection, we did not find anything suspicious.”
 
 However, further course of action depends on the result of laboratory tests of the water samples.
