The Times   and   Contest presented by Bajaj Electronics in association with Telangana Tourism is back! And like last year, we have kept the promise to make this annual gastronomical celebration 
bigger and better with more added categories yet again — Most Innovative Haleem and Biryani, Best Newcomer and, wait for it, Best Veg Biryani! Yep, there is such a thing as Vegetable Biryani — never mind what the hardcore meat eaters tell you. the art of cooking veggies and basmati rice on dum, layered with subtle spices and scented with saffron, is one that 
 Hyderabad’s restaurateurs have perfected. and it’s only fair we celebrate them. For a city that can eat biryani 24x7, 365 days a year, a little innovation doesn’t hurt. In fact, it’s always welcome. So, while we swear by the classic kachche gosht ki biryani and believe that nothing else can come quite close to it, when we hear the word biryani suffixed with anything else — think jackfruit, mushroom, Kabuli chana, ulavacharu, or, prawns, duck, rabbit, omelette... you name it — we succumb! This year, the innovation has extended to haleem as well. Ergo, the need to find and celebrate the quirkiest versions in town. 
 This year’s nominations for ‘innovative biryani’ sees a tangy-spicy raw mango and ginger version fighting it out with the very earthy and healthy millet dum biryani, and curiously, even a chicken biryani teased with little gaares or vadas. And there’s a haleem made of everything, from jackfruit to lobster, emu and crab — you’re spoilt for choice.
