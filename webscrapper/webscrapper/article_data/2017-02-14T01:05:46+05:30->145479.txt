THANE: A massive fire broke out at a scrap godown in   area of   during the wee hours of Monday. This led to a lot of panic in the neighbourhood.

 Officials from the fire department and regional disaster management reached the spot immediately and tried to douse the flames. However, it took them 12 hours, two fire engines and six water tanks to put off the blaze.
 
 Officials asserted that the piled up flammable plastic material along with shortage of water lengthened the time to extinguish the fire. Due to this, the entire process took a lot of time and the flames continues to spread, said an official from the fire department.
 
 “The fire began in one of these plastic units and quickly spread to nearby godowns because of the highly flammable material. Despite dousing the flames with water, the fire continued to reignite as it could easily catch fire even when it gets wet.’’ 
 
 As one tanker was not enough to douse the flames, we had to call in five other water tankers. We managed to douse the flames by 8.30am. It took us nearly five hours to safely clear the molten plastic and glass scrap. The entire operation took 12 hours,” said Santosh Kadam, an official from the disaster management cell at the RDMC.
 
 While there were no injuries or fatalities as the godowns were empty, officials are investigating as to how the fire began.
