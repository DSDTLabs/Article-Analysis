NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Tuesday said minister   had “cleared two procurement proposals” worth   1,714 crore to acquire 240 precision-guided bombs from Russia and 131 Barak missiles from Israel. 

 The Rs 1,254 crore acquisition of the 240 “smart” KAB-1500 laser-guided bombs for Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets from M/s JSC Rosoboron Exports (Russia) will “address the deficiency of precisionguided munitions” in the IAF’s arsenal as well as “enhance the offensive capabilities” of the force. 
 
 The 131 additional Barak-I missiles to be acquired from M/s Rafael Advanced Defence Systems Ltd (Israel), in turn, are meant to arm the earlier version of the anti-missile defence systems fitted on 14 Indian warships after the   conflict. “The long-pending contract to replenish the existing missile stocks... has been inked today,” said a source. 
 
 While the Barak-I system has an interception range of 9-km, the next-generation Barak-8 system now being fitted on other frontline warships like the Kolkata-class destroyers has a kill range of 70-km against enemy aircraft, drones and missiles. 
 
 The Barak-8 anti-missile defence systems have been developed under the long-delayed joint projects between   and   for Indian warships (initial cost was Rs 2,606 crore) and IAF air defence squadrons (Rs 10,076 crore).
