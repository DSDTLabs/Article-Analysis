BHOPAL: Officials of Civic body and district administration have given a thumbs down to an announcement by the latter, which would have forced them to work on a holiday.

 Last week, district administration had given a press release, announcing that ‘anti-encroachment’ drive to clear the city of   would be carried out on a Sunday. However, the   are now refuting the press release, saying it was never issued in the first place.
 
 The directive had come in the wake of an alleged assault on a woman in Bhim Nagar during a demolition drive by the   (BMC). Subsequently, district collector Nishant Warwade and senior police officials held a meeting. A press release issued by the district administration said that the BMC would carry   drive only after prior authorisation from ADM.
 
 It also said that a list of locations wherein demolition drive would be carried out, would be submitted to the ADM on a Friday. There are around 274 properties on government land that have been encroached upon in the state capital.
 
 According to BMC sources, a new list of locations, including spots around BRTS corridor at Misrod, has been forwarded to the ADM. The municipal body has already demolished a long stretch of the corridor after a court ruling in its favour last year.
 
 Sources said that encroachments near Subash Nagar railway crossing, Baba Nagar and a stretch near Mata Mandir are also on the demolition radar.
 
 However, BMC officials are yet to remove encroachments from Hamidia hospital campus.
