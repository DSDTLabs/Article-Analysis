"Teams from the architecture and planning department collected physical details of the number of units the builder has built as part of the project and those sanctioned as per layout plans approved by GNIDA," Deepak Agarwal, chief executive officer, GNIDA told TOI. "A survey was conducted to determine how many have been constructed without permission, their area and numbers. We have found that 382 units have been constructed in violation of our permissions."

"The process will continue on Tuesday and till all the units are sealed. These units are vacant and not occupied currently," the CEO said. "We have complied with the court's directions. Our action-taken report, along with our detailed findings, will be filed in our reply during the next hearing, which is on February 8," he added.
