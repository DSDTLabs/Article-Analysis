Tirupur: The district administration disconnected electricity connections to nine unauthorised textile printing units here on Monday. The officials of the Tamil Nadu pollution control board (TNPCB), who had inspected the units that were functioning at KVR Nagar, Anupparpalayam and Boyampalayam, had found them lacking the mandatory environmental clearance license from the board. “The units were having average capacity of discharging printing liquid waste of 500-1000 litres. But, they had not established effluent treatment plants or mechanisms to ensure zero liquid discharge (ZLD) norm. They were found dumping liquid waste in the open ground and in ditches,” said a senior TNPCB official. After TNPCB recommended action against the units, the district co-ordination committee on unauthorised manufacturing/processing units led by the collector directed the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation to disconnect power. tnn
