PATNA: Three late night flights of   and one of GoAir, which were scheduled to fly from the Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport from April 30, are likely to commence operations from next month.

 As of now, only one night   of Jet Airways is operating from the city airport on the Pune-Patna-Pune route since the intervening night of March 25 and 26.
 
 A JPNI airport official told this reporter on Monday, “Many Pratt & Whitney engine-powered Airbus A320 Neo planes of IndiGo and GoAir were grounded due to safety concerns between February and March this year. As a result, the two budget carriers are facing shortage of flights at present. Passengers will have to wait for another month to get their tickets for the proposed night flights.”
 
 As per the summer schedule approved by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, three IndiGo flights — Bengaluru-Patna-Bengaluru that had to land at   airport at 12.05am and depart at 3.55am,   flight that had to land at 1.25am and depart at 1.55am and Chennai-Kolkata-Patna-Kolkata-Chennai flight which had to land at 12.25am and take off at 5.30am — were scheduled to commence operations from April 30.
 
 An official of IndiGo, however, said the airline had not yet released any schedule for operation of the three proposed night flights. “We have not received any schedule of the new flights. If there was any news about the commencement of new flights, booking of tickets must have started. There is nothing available on our website, as of now,” he said.
 
 GoAir was also scheduled to commence operation of a flight on the Hyderabad-Patna-Hyderabad route, which was scheduled to land here at 9.35pm and depart at 10.05pm.
 
 At present, at least 38 flights operate from the Patna airport on weekdays and 39 on weekends.
