AGRA: Secretary of  's Yuvjan Sabha, Shahzad Alam Burni, has written a letter to the election commission demanding “detention” of   leaders, including Unnao MP  , for making provocative religious statements.
 
  The complaint is a direct fallout of Sakshi Maharaj's controversial statement on Friday blaming a particular community for population explosion in the country. The MP has already been booked by the   police for his remarks.
  
  In his letter to the election commission, Burni stated that a few BJP leaders are trying to provoke religious sentiments, with the intent to create tensions between communities to polarise the voters ahead of the crucial Uttar Pradesh elections. He said, in order to prevent such ugly situations from arising, it's necessary to detain leaders like Sakshi Maharaj.
  
  Talking to TOI, Burni said such leaders are also well known for making provocative communal remarks. He said though BJP claims that it doesn’t ask for votes in the name of religion, the truth is that it's leaders always attempt to evoke religious sentiments of the voters through rabid speeches. He said the recent statement against a particular community by Sakshi Maharaj is just another example.
  
  Burni said that by making such statements, these leaders not just violate the model code of conduct but also disturb the prevailing communal harmony in the state.
  
  Ironically, Sakshi Maharaj's comments were made just four days after the   ruled that political parties and candidates can’t seek votes in the name of religion, caste or creed.
