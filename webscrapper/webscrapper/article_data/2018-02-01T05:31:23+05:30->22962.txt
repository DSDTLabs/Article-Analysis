MUMBAI: Days after schoolteacher Prabhakar Macha was questioned by the state anti-terrorism squad (ATS) in connection with his alleged links with seven people working for CPI (Maoist), he committed suicide at his Pratiksha Nagar residence on January 23. 

 ATS officials did not respond to TOI’s calls and text messages. Macha’s name was mentioned by one of the accused, but he was not arrested. In its FIR, the ATS stated that the arrested accused were trying to recruit more people from Maharashtra and Gujarat to spread their ideology. The seven accused were booked under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, (UAPA).

 A family member said that Macha used to translate several news articles from Marathi to Telugu and his wife would help him in this. Soon after his name cropped up in the Maoist case, an ATS team conducted searches at his home and seized some documents. Around 10.30am on January 23, Macha’s son ran downstairs from his second floor residence and asked the security guard to call for an ambulance. Macha had hanged himself from the ceiling and was rushed to hospital. Macha was mourning his wife’s death and felt lonely, said sources. It was at this time that the ATS team questioned him. “A few days later, he committed suicide,” said a resident from the Pratiksha Nagar building where Macha lived. The ATS had named seven accused in the FIR. The prime accused, Aja alias Mahesh Lingaya Venugopalan, had named Macha as a sympathizer. 
 
 The families of the seven accused said that they have been framed and had no links with the outlawed group.
