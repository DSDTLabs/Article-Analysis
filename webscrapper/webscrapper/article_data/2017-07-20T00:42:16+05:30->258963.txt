Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday impleaded the state’s transport principal secretary as a party to the case against conversion of petrol and LPG autos into diesel autos. 

 It issued an interim injunction restraining the transport authority from permitting the conversion till August 21. A division bench of justices G R Swaminathan and K K Sasidharan gave the direction on a petition filed by one K Palraj from Madurai.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel R Venkatesan said that there were 14,000 share autos using diesel as fuel in Madurai city many of which were not following traffic rules. 
 
 They carried passengers more than the prescribed limits and caused   too. Though the Union government gave permission only to LPG autos to protect the environment, this was not the case of Tamil Nadu, he said. 
 
 To earn more profits, the auto drivers converted autos which were plying on petrol and LPG into diesel-powered ones, which the transport authority permited too, the counsel said. Special government pleader M Govindan said that there were 16,199 autos plying with petrol and diesel.
 
  Because of this, the district collector-cum-regional transport authority had stopped granting new permits from August 14, 2015. 
 
 Now, it has been decided to allow replacement of existing vehicles if they had become old and not road worthy. He also claimed that the authority was taking proper action against the errant auto drivers.
