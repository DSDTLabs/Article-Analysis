Panaji: The annual five-day festivities to mark Durga puja — the period of worship of the goddess considered the epitome of power — is set to commence from September 26. The revelries that mark the triumph of good over evil in Hindu mythology, will culminate with the immersion of the goddess’ idol on September 30.

 The celebrations will start on Shashti — the sixth day of Navratri — when the idol is installed for worship. The ceremonies and prayers continue for the three subsequent days of Saptami, Ashtami and Navami.
 
 The Bengali Cultural Association (BCA) of Panaji arranges for a priest from Kolkata for the puja that is organised at the Gomantak Maratha Samaj Hall. This is done to preserve the traditonal spirit of the festival. 
 
  A dhaki (percussionist) who plays the indigenous drums of West Bengal is also brought in from the state to maintain the authencity of the cultural tradition.
 
 Artisans also travel to Goa every year from Kumartuli, the famous potter’s colony on the banks of the Hooghly river in north Kolkata, to make the idols of Maa Durga, her four children, Mahisasura — the demon, and their vahanas or animals they use as vehicles. Besides prayers and rituals, BCA’s celebrations comprise a vegetarian community lunch on the puja days. This is followed by aarti in the evenings along with cultural programmes, games and contests. This year, a professional dance troupe is scheduled to hold a Kathak recital on the evening of Ashtami, while Navami will witness an orchestra performance.
 
 The festival comes to a close on Dashami — the tenth day of Dussehra — when the idol is taken around the city in a procession and finally, immersed in the sea off Miramar beach. “Nowadays, we don’t leave the idol in water because we want to do our bit to protect the beach and save the environment. We dip the idol in water and then take it out.” said A Das, BCA’s cultural secretary.
