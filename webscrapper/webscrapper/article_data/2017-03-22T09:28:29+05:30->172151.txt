Director B Unnikrishnan’s upcoming film  , which has  ,   and   in the lead, will seemingly have many firsts! One of them being that it will be the first Malayalam film to be shot in   resolution.

 The immediate question that followed online when the filmmaker announced his decision was why shoot a movie in such an advanced format when most of the Kerala theatres aren’t even equipped to screen a movie in 4K. The director though clarified his decision in a recent interview.
 
 He had said that currently most of the films are shot at 1.8K and then upscaled to 2K or 4K, resulting in loss of quality and sharpness of visuals. His plan is to shoot the film in 8K and then bring in down to 4K or 2K, depending on the theatres, so that it would compromise on the visual quality of the movie.   had earlier told us that his focus has been on ensuring that the film is technically perfect.
