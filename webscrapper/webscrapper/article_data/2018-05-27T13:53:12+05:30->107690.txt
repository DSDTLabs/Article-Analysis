  According to the FIR lodged by Avnish, the injured person, at   police station in Badaun six years ago, he had gone to the agriculture produce marketing committee for weighing wheat, which was loaded in his truck. “When our turn came to unload the wheat and weigh it, another truck came and asked us to move back, saying they wanted to unload their truck first. When we refused, they made a call to someone and five men, Faheem, Naeem, Jahangir, Manav Gupta and Akbar, armed with rifles and country-made pistols, arrived. They started firing, which injured me and killed Anil, a bus cleaner. As panic spread, people closed down their shops and tried to flee the spot.
