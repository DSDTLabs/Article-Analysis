KOLKATA: Chief minister   on Tuesday threw her weight behind the three-language policy, saying this method would enable them (read schoolkids in Bengal) to reach regional, national and international standards.

 “Bengal respects all languages and languages of all states. Our three-language formula shows how we really do... India is a vast country and the strength of our nation is unity in diversity. We must respect every mother tongue and also give every regional language its importance. We believe in the freedom of choice and the three language formula,” Mamata wrote on her Facebook page.
 
 “Students have the freedom to take any language of their choice as a first language, second or third language. If the student choses  , Hindi, English, Urdu , Gurmukhi, Nepali, Alchiki as the first language, he/she may opt for two other languages of their choice. One of the three languages has to be Bengali,” she added.
 
 According to sources, the chief minister had taken exception to some complaints made by parents that the schools were not offering Bengali as an optional subject even if they wanted so. A party leader said, “The CM was surprised to note that some schools chose to stay open on  . If other states could do it why not Bengal, she had asked.”
