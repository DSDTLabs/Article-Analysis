CHENNAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has managed to stall the release of Rs 3.63 crore worth properties attached from Mumbai-based companies —   Jewels and   — which had dealt with conman  , now in jail for an attempt to bribe election commission officials in the AIADMK’s   symbols case.

 On March 23, the appellate tribunal of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) directed the ED to release the seized assets. 
 
 Assailing the ruling, ED had filed the present petition, which came up before a vacation bench comprising Justice M M Sundresh and Justice R Mahadevan. The bench on Wednesday granted interim stay for four weeks.
 
 It all started with a complaint from Canara Bank which led the Central Crime branch (CCB) in Chennai to register cases against a bank official and two directors of M/s Future Techniks Pvt Ltd for cheating to the tune of Rs 19.21 crore. According to the FIR dated March 19, 2013, the funds were transferred to various accounts held in various banks through 20 RTGS transactions and these transactions did not appear to be in the normal course of business.
 
 Therefore, the bank apprehended high risk to public money and lodged a complaint to the CCB. During investigation, it came to light that the two Mumbai companies had transferred Rs 19.22 crore by Future Techniks, as agreed by Sukash chandrasekar and Ajit Jain. They two had agreed to share the proceeds of crime in the ratio of 60% and 40%, it said.
 
 The suspects could not prove that the amounts disbursed by Future Techniks, as stated by Sukash Chandrasekar, were not at the instance of Mangal Royal Jewels and Mangal Bullion with regard to their commercial dealings with other companies, the ED said. In its present appeal, ED said the appellate tribunal had failed to consider the Rs 3.63 crore transactions of these two companies as interconnected activities of money laundering.
