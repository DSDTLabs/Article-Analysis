GURUGRAM: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Haryana minister of industries, commerce and environment Vipul Goel has generated Rs 2.5 crore by auctioning gifts received by him in the last couple of years as   minister, to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.

 The payments of the sale were made via demand drafts directly in the name of the PM’s Relief Fund. “The relief work, for those affected by big natural calamities such as earthquakes and floods, to something as small as treatment for the poor, is funded through the PM’s Relief Fund. I thought of contributing this money to the fund,” said the minister.
 
 The minister further said he hopes to inspire more ministers and political leaders to take such steps, as these gifts are presented to them as ministers, not personally.
 
 The sale was carried out at an event held in   on Sunday where many celebrities with Harynvi origin, including actor Randeep Hooda, singer Richa Sharma and Olympian Gagan Narang, were in attendance.
 
 The highest price at the sale was raised for a memento, for which an industrialist paid Rs 1 crore.   awardee   also performed a solo musical act ‘Vivekananda’ at the event.
