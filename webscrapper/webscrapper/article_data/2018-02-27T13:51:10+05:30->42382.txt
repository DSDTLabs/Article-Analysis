NEW DELHI: Bears of the equity market were on the prowl again on Tuesday morning as fraud-ridden Punjab National Bank (PNB) slipped more than 13 per cent in mid-day trade.

 At 1.47 pm, the   was down 13.23 per cent on Rs 97.10 on the BSE. The broader market was 0.20 per cent in the red.
 
 The downturn in the state-run bank gained impetus as the lender on Monday revealed additional unauthorised transactions related to the scam by billionaire diamantaire   and his uncle and business partner, Mehul Choksi, increasing the estimated size of the fraud by $204 million (Rs 1,322 crore). This increase means that the total fraud now amounts to nearly $2 billion (Rs 12,622 crore) as against the original estimated $1,772 million (over Rs 11,300 crore).
 
 
 
 
 The fresh round of bleeding in the PNB stock means that it has tanked 34 per cent since the fraud first broke out on February 14.
 
 The PNB stock took its toll on the overall market as the benchmark indices- Sensex and Nifty slipped into red after opening on a buoyant note. The Nifty PSU bank sub-index was down almost 4 per cent. Private bank and financial service sub-indices were also facing the brunt.
