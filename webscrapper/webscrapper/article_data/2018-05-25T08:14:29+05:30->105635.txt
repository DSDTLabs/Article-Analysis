CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government has set up the Justice (retd)   committee to probe the Tuticorin anti-Sterlite protest violence, but the Justice (retd) Rajeswaran commission formed in 2017 to probe the alleged police excesses during   is yet to submit its report.

 In February 2017, then chief minister   formed the commission to probe into the causes and circumstances leading to law and order disruption in various parts of Tamil Nadu on January 23, 2017, after pro-jallikatu protests.
 
 In Chennai, incidents of police excesses were reported in places like Triplicane near  , where thousands of protesters had gathered. It was reported that policemen beat up innocent bystanders, including adolescents and elderly women. Nobody was killed in that violence.
 
 The commission was given three months to probe the incident. However, four extensions and 16 months later, it is yet to submit the report. “It will take 8 more months to finish the probe. We received 1,950 affidavits from Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore and Salem. Examination and cross examination of so many witnesses is taking time,” Justice Rajeswaram told TOI.
 
 Social activist Jayaram Venkatesan said the whole process of setting up an inquiry commission was to prolong the issue and release the report years after the incident faded from people’s memory. 
 
 “The police, in a very pre-organised way, send witnesses to the commission while threatening common citizens not to report or testify,” he said.
