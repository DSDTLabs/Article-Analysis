AHMEDABAD: Why are most of the murders in the city that are attributed to contract killers undetected? This question is causing a churn in the state’s police galleries.

 From the nine-year-old murder of contractor Narendrasinh Parmar — who was shot dead at point blank range in the parking lot of Sheel Complex in Mithakali by two persons in March 2009 — to builder Hanif Shaikh alias Dadhi’s murder in Jamalpur in September 2016 and the recent daylight murder of transporter Suresh Shah in  , cops have no clues to the masterminds or are unable to trace them.
 
 Police have a standard answer. “We are close to the masterminds and these   will be solved in a few days.” However, the   speaks volumes about the efforts put in by cops.
 
 According to senior police officials, while they have no CCTV footage of Narendrasinh Parmar’s murder, footage of the murders of Shaikh and Shah do not enable identification of the accused.
 
 “We have and are questioning several persons suspected in Shaikh’s murder. Shaikh was shot dead near Navi Chal in Jamalpur on the night of September 17, 2016. We are also after the main suspect in the Suresh Shah murder, who was shot by two shooters near a temple in Vasna a fortnight ago,” said a senior city police official.
 
 In their defence, city police officials offer claims about their efficiency in detecting of Rs 99 lakh cash van robbery and the robbery-murder of angadia worker Arvind Patel, who was shot dead near   in early March.
 
 “All these three murder victims were supposedly gunned down by contract killers. In Shaikh’s murder, his links to senior police officials and his controversial past had emerged. There were several criminal cases against Shaikh,” a senior police official said.
