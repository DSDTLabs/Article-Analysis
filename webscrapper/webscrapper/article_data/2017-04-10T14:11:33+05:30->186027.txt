KALYAN: A police team that had gone to nab   at the infamous   basti in Ambivli was attacked by the family members of chain   on Sunday early morning. A mob of around 25, mostly women, attacked the policemen and also tried to set one policeman on fire by pouring kerosene on him.

 The attack was planned by the mob to help the accused escape arrest.
 
 In the attack, two policemen including a police sub inspector and one constable were injured after the mob pelted stones on them.
 
 The anti-chain snatching team of DCP Sunil Bhardwaj of Ulhasnagar division got an information that two chain-snatchers Samir Irani and Hasan Irani Sayyed, who were wanted in several cases, are hiding at their residence in Irani basti. Bhardwaj, along with 25 policemen embarked on a combing operation to nab Irani and Sayyed. 
 
 The police said that the team was successful in nabbing the two accused. But when they were returning, a mob intercepted them and argued with them. One of the accused’s relative also poured kerosene on constable Daji Gaikwad and tried to set him on fire. In the melee, the accused fled.
 
 Ajit Jadhav, assistant police inspector of Khadakpada police station said, “On the basis of the complaint of the constable who was assaulted by the mob we have booked 25 accused and are probing the case.”
 
 However, family members of the suspects say Samir Irani was suffering from fever and was being falsely accused by police. They also claimed that to avoid Samir’s arrest, one relative had poured kerosene on herself. In the past too several attacks have taken place on policemen during combing operations at the locality. In fact, this is the eighth such incident in the last 10 years when policemen have been attacked during a raid at Irani   which has emerged as a “village of chain snatchers”, said police.
