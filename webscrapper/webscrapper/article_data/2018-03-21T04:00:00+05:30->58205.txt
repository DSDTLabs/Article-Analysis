Rajkot: A private hospital employee was arrested for raping a nurse after reneging on his promise of marrying her. 

 The rape survivor (26), who is a native of Bhuva village near Sutrapada town of Gir-Somnath district, lodged a complaint against Rajesh Chudasama, a resident of Somnath Society, alleging that he raped her several times in past two years after promising to marry her. 
 
 Chudasama got acquainted with the woman when came to meet his friend who was her colleague. He even helped her get a better job at another private hospital.
 
 The accused used to tell her that his wife had blackmailed him into marriage and he would divorce her soon. He even clicked obscene pictures of the nurse in his mobile phone. He indulged in physical relations with her at a hotel on Morbi Road as well as in the hospital. 
 
 When she started insisting on marriage, Chudasama threatened to send her objectionable pictures to her brother. Fed up of harassment, the survivor left the city and returned to her native village. She even broke her phone as Chudasama used to constantly send her threats.
 
 However, the accused then started sending text messages to the womanâ€™s mother which led to the nurse finally breaking down in front of her family members.
