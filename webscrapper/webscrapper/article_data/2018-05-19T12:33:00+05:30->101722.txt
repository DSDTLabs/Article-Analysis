City-based bands   and Road Roller recently organised a music concert at a recording studio in Salt Lake. Road Roller opened the show with their own composition, Tor maa ke pronam janash, and followed it up with Raasta karo ekaar noy, Bal brahmachari and Rokte rokte rock. 
 
  
 Several young music lovers dropped in to catch a glimpse of the show and also sang along with the performers. Up next was band Shnuopoka who rendered songs like   bhangate, Honeymoon e, Darjeeling, Ami Devdas noi, Bolchhi shona and Nirob chokh. 
  
  
 Band members of Shnuopoka also sang a few songs requested by the audience. The show ended with an impromptu drum solo by Sunny that saw the crowd dancing to the beats.
