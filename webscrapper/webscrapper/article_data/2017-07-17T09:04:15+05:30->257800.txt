NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old   was arrested for allegedly   and injuring a   in northwest Delhi’s   on June 26. Initially, the case was reported to be a robbery attempt gone awry, but probe revealed that the gym trainer had attacked the bank manager as the latter had tried to   him while he was visiting his apartment.

 The 30-year-old bank manager had gone to   with stab injuries on his body and complained that a man had stabbed him when he resisted his robbery attempt. He was then taken to a hospital for treatment.
 
 While scanning through the bank manager’s call records, a team led by ACP Model Town Hukma Ram Jat found that he had been in constant touch with the accused and they had even communicated on the day of the incident.
 
 This made them suspicious and Model Town SHO Satish Kumar took the help of a sub-inspector to access the Facebook account of the complainant. They found that the bank manager used to chat regularly with the gym trainer. They then contacted a common friend of the victim and the accused and he led them to the gym trainer in Shahdara from where he was arrested.
 
 The gym trainer told the cops that he had met the manager on Facebook and soon they exchanged their phone numbers. After chatting for a period, the manager called him to his house while his parents were away and then tried to sexually assault him. When he resisted, the manager took a knife from the kitchen and tried to stab him. In the ensuing fight, the gym trainer managed to snatch the knife and slashed at the manager several times to defend himself.
 
 The bank manger then locked the gym trainer in a room and ran down. He gathered his neighbours and cooked up the story of robbery. Seeing the neighbours gathering outside the apartment, the gym trainer cut open a mesh at the back of the house and climbed down a drainpipe to escape.
 
 DCP (northwest) Milind Dumbere said they are looking into taking legal action against the bank manager.
