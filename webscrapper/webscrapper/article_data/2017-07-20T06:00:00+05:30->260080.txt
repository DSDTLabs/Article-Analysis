With multiple exhibitions being held in the city of late,   are spoilt for choice.   in their designer and ethnic attires, the city socialites were spotted picking up the best of traditional and contemporary Indian wear at an ongoing three-day   organised for a cause. And after wrapping up their shopping, the ladies were seen happily posing for the shutterbugs and mingling with each other.
