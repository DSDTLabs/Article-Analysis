The CO also added that the   had been asked to conduct a further inquiry into the matter.
 
 Talking to TOI, Sharma said, “The police is making a fool of us. First, they said we have reached a compromise with the boy’s father after taking money from them. I do not know how police could say this without talking to us. Secondly, even after the CO’s direction, no one from the   police has contacted us till date.” 
 
 On Thursday, Sharma wrote to the CM seeking an action in the matter.
 
 CO Mishra said he would seek a report from the police station concerned.
