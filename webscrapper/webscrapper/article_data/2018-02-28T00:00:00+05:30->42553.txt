The Theatre Olympics 2018 aims to promote the culture of theatre and get a dialogue going between practitioners and connoisseurs. And   Karnad’s  , which has been directed by KM   and stars  , is going to be staged in  . “I’m very excited that the play is travelling to Jammu. In my 45-year-old theatre career, I’ve never had the opportunity to perform in that state. I’m excited as this is a complex play and I 
personally believe it is one of the best productions in terms of stories and execution we’ve had in recent times,” says Arundhati.
 The play, which features   as a writer who ends up talking to her doppleganger on a screen, has a video running simultaneously, which the protagonist chats with. The team shot those portions once again for the first time after they began staging the production over a decade ago. “It was Girish who insisted that we re-shoot the portions. It was tough, as it required an hour-long take that Arundhati had to get just right. We convinced her to do it again and we’re now using this new video for the production in Jammu,” says Chaitanya.
 Arundhati laughs and adds, “As a medium, we take cinema very lightly when compared to theatre, but this showed how tough it is to get it right.” The team plans to stage the play once in   with the newly-shot footage to get the nuances right before they set off to stage it at the Theatre Olympics on April 1.
