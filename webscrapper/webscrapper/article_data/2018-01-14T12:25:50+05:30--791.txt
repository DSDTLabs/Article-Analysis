BENGALURU: The   ( ), which was the first in the country to launch biodiesel buses, is to take a step back by deciding not to purchase any more buses that run on alternative fuel.

 
 The state-run corporation is yet to find a company to supply biodiesel despite floating tenders three times. KSRTC’s several biodiesel buses have been running on diesel. “We’ve decided not to expand biodiesel buses till we get adequate supply of the fuel,” KSRTC managing director S R   said.
 
 Hyderabad-based Advait   was selected to provide biodiesel but it has stopped supply since December 2016. Many private firms complain that a clause in the tender which states that biodiesel must be supplied at Rs 5 less than the price of diesel per litre is the reason for poor response. Umashankar said: “We’re ready to relax the conditions in the next tender to attract more firms. We will agree even if firms are ready to supply biodiesel at the same rate of diesel.”
 
  
  
 KSRTC has 26 AC buses which run on 100% biodiesel and 1,500 buses which operate on 20% blended biodiesel. In 2015, KSRTC decided to convert its 8,300-odd buses from diesel to biodiesel to reduce pollution.“Nearly 25,000 barrels of waste and used oil are generated in the state from restaurants, industries and vehicle service stations every month, but only 10% of them are being reprocessed. There are several authorized recycling units approved by the  ," said its chairman Lakshman.
