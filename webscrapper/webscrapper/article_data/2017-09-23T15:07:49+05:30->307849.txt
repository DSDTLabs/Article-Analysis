AURANGABAD: A   rural hospital official was arrested red-handed while accepting   of Rs 500 by an anti-corruption bureau (ACB) squad on Friday evening. 

 The suspect has been identified as   (57) and works as an assistant superintendent of the hospital at Pachod in   taluka.
 
 According to an ACB statement, the complainant was sent to   for his on-duty training between March 15 and 18, 2017 from Pachod hospital. His salary for the four days was deducted as he was shown absent. He prepared his file of his training programme and applied with documents in support of his claim seeking the official to release his four days salary. The application was gathering dust on Lokhande's table who sought Rs 500 in bribe for forwarding it.
 
 Since the applicant was reluctant to shell the money out, he lodged a formal complaint with the ACB and the bureau officials on verifying the facts mentioned by him in the complaint laid a trap at the hospital. 
 
 They arrested Lokhande after he accepted the powdered currency notes.
