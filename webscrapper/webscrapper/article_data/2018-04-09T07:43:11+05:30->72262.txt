 Around 14,400 candidates appeared in JEE at 25 centres in the city. Most examinees found mathematics questions toughest, physics ones lengthy and chemistry’s comparatively easier but tricky.
 
 “In the first paper, mathematics was quite lengthy and took maximum time, while chemistry was the easiest. I had solved last five years’ paper but this year’s mathematics was toughest of all,” said IIT-aspirant  . Students said that mathematics and physics questions took a lot of time and they could give lesss time to solve chemistry.
 
 “Chemistry is always scoring, but this time both physic and mathematics were lengthy so most candidates could not devote much time to chemistry,” said   who felt that there were less numerical-based questions in Physics this time and more on theoretical aspects.
