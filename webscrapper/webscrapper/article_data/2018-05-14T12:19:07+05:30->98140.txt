In the latest episode of MTV  , the contestants drove to the task location with the gang leaders. Rannvijay argues with them when they start to complain about the sleeping conditions and not having enough blankets. Rannvijay tells them to expect worse conditions as they were competing on 'Xtreme'.

 
 After Prince's team secured immunity in the last episode, the new task was a competition between Neha and Nikhil's combined team and Raftaar's team. The rules for the competition irked Neha, who accused Rannvijay of favouring Raftaar.
 
 
 
  
 
 In the task, the contestants had to dig out eggs from the field and throw them to the other partner before the competitor can collect it. Nishkarsh and Rohan were the first ones to pair up but manage to secure only one egg. Geetika and Sonu from Raftaar's team together collect three eggs but break them up. Gang leaders Neha and Nikhil were given the task of breaking open the jar with all the eggs without damaging them but fail to do so. The teams failed to secure immunity in this round.
 
 In the vote out, the contestants plot to eliminate Sandy and Geetika from Raftaar's team. On the other hand, Nishkarsh shocked everyone when he targeted his own team and nominated Mehak during the vote. Surbhi accused him of favouring Nikhil's team and the entire team supported her.
 
 When it came to the gang leaders's turn, Nikhil's team requested him to save Rohan. While Nikhil ended up nominating Shruti and Shubda, Neha nominated Sandy and Nishkarsh from her gang. Raftaar nominated Farah and Pavneet.
 
 Everybody nominated Surbhi to leave the show, making her cry. Farah, from Raftaar's team gets voted out in the end.
