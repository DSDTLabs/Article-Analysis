SURAT: The   (FOSTTA) has opposed the recovery notices sent to the textile shop owners for paying the property tax for the shelf space created inside the shops for storing the grey fabrics and finished stock. 

 A delegation led by FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal submitted a memorandum to municipal commissioner to abolish dual property tax system on the textile shops.
 
 Textile traders said that most of the textile shops in the textile markets at Ring Road, Sahara Darwaja and Salabatpura have been built at 16 feet height. The textile shop owners have created shelfs inside their shops to store the bundles of grey fabrics and finished shops, in absence of their owing huge storage godowns. 
 
 The then municipal commissioner S Aparna had asked the property tax department to start a fresh survey of the textile shops and imposed dual tax on the textile shops having storage shelfs. The property tax department was asked to consider the shelf as the godowns, and thus the shop owners were asked to cough up dual tax — entire shop as well as the shelf area. 
 
 Talking to TOI, FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal said, “Many shop owners in the textile markets have been paying dual property tax since 2014. Recently, the corporation issued notices in bulk to those who are not paying the dual tax. Despite the shop owners paying taxes regularly, most of the textile markets are still not getting water supply, basic amenities and cleanliness is a big issue.”
 
 Agarwal added, “Textile shop owners have purchased the shops from the realtors who built the textile markets. If the height of the textile shops are 16 feet, then the shop owners are going to utilize the shelf space for storing their goods. Now, the civic body is considering this space as godown and want us to pay tax.”
