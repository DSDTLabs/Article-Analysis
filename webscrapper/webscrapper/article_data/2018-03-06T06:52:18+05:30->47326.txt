LUCKNOW:   of   and its 162 affiliated colleges wrote their first examination on Monday — under   for the first time ever. The   was encouraging as   was reported and the examination was held peacefully at all 35 centres.

 “Last year, we caught many students carrying calculators and papers during frisking before entry but this year they were aware of the strictness and themselves made sure not to carry things that are not permitted in the examination hall,” said Prof Ashutosh Singh.
 
 “Examination was held peacefully on the first day. No cheating incident was reported at any examination centre,” said examination controller AK Sharma.
 
 The flying squad cross-checked the seating arrangements at all centres. Reports of CCTV cameras monitoring at every centre were also received from colleges.
 
 “In LU, CCTV cameras have been installed in 17 rooms where the examination was held. A meeting of all university teachers and vice-chancellor SP Singh was held to ensure smooth conduct of the remaining exams,” he added.
