NEW DELHI: Following chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s apologies to his political opponents, his deputy   said on Monday, “We do not want to fight any battle of ego with anyone. If anybody is hurt by our remarks, we will apologise.” 

 Besides Kejriwal’s   to   and BJP’s  , both he and Sisodia also apologised on Monday to Congress’ Kapil Sibal and his son Amit for making “unfounded” allegations in 2013. 
 
 Sisodia said outside the assembly, “We are here to work for people. We do not have spare time for court, we want to use the time to fight for people.” He added, “As we have to dedicate more time for development work, we do not want to spend time in court.” In all, 33 defamation cases have been lodged against   in 22 states. 
 
 However, Sisodia did not clarify if Kejriwal would also apologise to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. “We will tell you when we do that,” Sisodia said. 
 
 AAP is trying to convince its unhappy functionaries that an apology is the best way out of the legal battles which are “taking a toll on the already constrained resources of the party and its functionaries”, said a source.
