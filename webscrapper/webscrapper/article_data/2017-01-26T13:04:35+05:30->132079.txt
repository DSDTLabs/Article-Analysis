IMPHAL: Chief minister   has demanded that the BJP-led government at the Centre spell out the contents of the framework agreement signed by the Centre and the   (Isak-Muivah) on August 3, 2015. 

 "After BJP came to power at the Centre for the second time, the party signed a framework agreement with the NSCN (I-M) in a clandestine manner - nobody knows what the contents of the agreement are," Ibobi said, addressing a news conference on Tuesday evening. The first such instance, which he was referring to, was the people's uprising in June 2001 against the extension of the NSCN (I-M) ceasefire beyond Nagaland. This agreement was made between the then BJP-led NDA government and the Naga rebel outfit. During the agitation, 18 people had died and the state assembly building had been burnt down.
 
 If BJP comes to power, the chief minister said, it will be a tacit permission to "break" Manipur. "It is time for the people of Manipur to be cautious of BJP, which wants to fracture the state," he said. He accused the Naga People's Front (NPF), which is a BJP ally in Nagaland, and the NSCN (I-M) of harbouring the same intentions. The chief minster also attributed the recent exits of Congress MLAs to "pressure" from BJP and NPF. 
 
 Ibobi said he has discussed all steps taken by the state government to end the stir with Union home minister  , who, in turn, conveyed the message of the   (UNC) that it would lift the blockade, which has been on since November 1, if the state government rolls back the creation of the Kangpokpi and Jiribam districts. Ibobi said he responded to this by saying that the districts have been created solely for administrative convenience and nobody should interfere with the process. 
 
 UNC is a mouthpiece of the NSCN (I-M), which is engaged in talks with the Centre, which has not taken any steps to end the blockade, the CM said.
