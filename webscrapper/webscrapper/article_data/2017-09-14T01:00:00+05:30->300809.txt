The makers of ' ' are upset with the Central Board of Film   ( ), after the film was denied U/A certification. What has angered them further is that the Board has refused to explain its decision. Director Rajat S Mukherjee, says, “The CBFC’s letter doesn’t state any reason for our film being denied U/A certification. Though there’s nothing obscene in it, we were told to make some cuts to get an A certificate. We thought that the situation would improve after Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the Chairman, but in vain.” 
Through the perspective of the protagonist Mia ( ), 'Umeed' shows how pharma giants use celebrities to give ‘unethical clinical trials’ the mask of vaccination programmes. The film, which also stars Mohan Kapur, Yatin Karyekar and  , also reveals the unholy nexus between politicians, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. The makers feel that the Board’s demand — to snip out portions that are allegedly inspired by real incidents — is illogical. Producer Amrit Sethia adds, “Right from inception, we knew that there will be people who wouldn’t like to see or hear the truth about unethical drug trials, but we hadn’t expected the Board to pressurise us. We’ve asked them to reconsider their decision and are trying to contact Prasoon. Their response is awaited.” 
 'Umeed', presented by S.O.I.E and produced by Welcome Friends Productions, is yet to find a release date.
