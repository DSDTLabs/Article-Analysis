AMRITSAR: Chief   (CKD) suspended chief Charanjit Singh  , who was caught in a controversy after his objectionable video went viral, submitted his resignation on Monday evening. He sent it to CKD honorary secretary N S Khurana.

 On December 28, 2017, Akal   jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh had summoned Chadha to appear before the Sikh clergy on January 23. The summons were issued after an objectionable video showing him with a women went viral on the internet on December 26, 2017. Not only the groups backed by Congress, Akali and BJP are working overtime to garner support and create a wave in their favour, but there is a tug of war within these groups.
 
 The summoning of Chadha by the Takht was initially considered as a suo moto notice of ‘bajjar kurhait’ (transgression) committed by head of a Sikh institution, but the jathedar’s statement taking a decision on running CKD and its allied institutions suggested indirect interference of   and, being out of power, their keen interest in controlling the reigns of CKD.
 
 “We will not want the   jathedar to set a wrong precedent by interfering in the matters of a constitutional body. If the jathedar tries to constitute an ad hoc body to run the affairs of CKD, it will be challenged,”   president Advocate Jaswinder Singh, who is also additional secretary of CKD, told TOI on Monday. However, he added that the Akal Takht could intervene in the matter of violation of Sikh rehat maryada (Sikh code of conduct).
