MARGAO: An indefinite statewide strike call from January 19 onwards has been issued by the   on Sunday.

 The   vice president   told TOI that the private tourist taxi operators have resolved in a meeting held on Sunday not to ply their vehicles from January 19 onwards. “Since the government is harassing us a lot. Chief Minister   is bluffing us as till date, he has not given a single reply to our letters addressed to him. Regarding the proposed introduction of digital meters, I had asked him whether it would be introduced for all  , including buses and he agreed. I further pointed out that I was referring to the tourist buses as these vehicles similar to our seven-plus-one seater maxi cabs also pay passenger tax. But the transport department’s road transport officer (RTO) harrases us asking for the license to operate heavy vehicles and the mini bus badge. So we have been fighting against them,” said Afonso.
 
 Afonso said, “Regarding the   decision to install speed governors for the cabs, it may be recalled that the SC had passed a verdict to demolish a portion of the Cidade de Goa resort at Dona Paula but through an amendment, the hotel was saved. So we have requested Parrikar to save us as we are poor people. Furthermore, the SC has ruled that Aadhaar cards are not mandatory to be linked to the bank accounts but yet the government has bypassed the SC order and is implementing the Aadhaar cards.”
