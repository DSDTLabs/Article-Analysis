NEW DELHI: Loss-hit   (PNB) on Sunday said the acquisition of Bhushan Steel by   will help pare the lender’s stock of NPAs by Rs 3,857 crore and is expected to add to the bank’s profitability by Rs 735 crore during the current quarter.

 
 PNB, the fourth-biggest Indian lender by assets, in the last quarter, posted its biggest-ever net loss after being hit by a massive fraud. The loss for the three months to March 31 came in at Rs 13,417 crore compared with a net profit of Rs 262 crore a year ago. The bank has witnessed deterioration in gross net performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans, which rose to 18.38 per cent of gross advances at the end of March this year, as against 12.53 per cent year ago. Net NPAs were also soared to 11.24 per cent against 7.81 per cent a year ago.
 
 The Delhi-headquartered bank had the second-highest exposure to Bhushan Steel — which is the first among the high-profile 12 cases in which the resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was completed on Friday. However, Singals (promoters) have challenged the decision in the NCLAT.
 
 Of the total exposure to Bhushan Steel, the bank had set aside Rs 1,542 crore as provisions. “While the bank will recover Rs 3,050 crore of the outstanding amount, it will also be able to write off Rs 807.5 crore from the provision it had held for this NPA,” a bank executive said. Also, lenders, including PNB, will continue to own 12% in the acquired entity, giving it the opportunity to cash out later when the valuation of the company goes up, the banker added.
 
 Tata Steel Ltd had won the bid to acquire debt-laden   (BSL) in an insolvency auction.   (BNPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, has successfully completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in BSL.
