KOLLAM: A day after the home department was subjected to some harsh criticism by party comrades at the   district   conference, chief minister Pinarayi   on Sunday urged police to behave themselves. 

 "The police should not be under the impression that they have all the right to do anything since they have power. The police have only powers that are within the law. But there are certain people in the police force who think otherwise," said the chief minister while formally declaring the Kollam city police commissioner's office as ISO 9001:2015 certified.
 
 He said that there should not be any use of foul languages and no more torture at police stations. The government will not protect those officers who indulge in such acts. There are some who are eager to "exercise" their "powers", said Vijayan.
 
 "Some policemen are under the wrong impression that they have the licence to use foul languages and also use their muscle power on the people. These are the traditional practices they have been following. But time has changed and so has the police force. However, some officers are not willing to change. I am telling to such people better change yourselves or else you will face strict action," warned the chief minister.
 
 Vijayan was at the receiving end the other day at the CPM district conference in which most of the delegates attacked the home department headed by him. There were also allegations that the police had shown high handedness against a   leader in Kollam. However, the chief minister did not make any comment regarding this at the conference.
 
 It is in this backdrop that the chief minister had come with a warning against the police force.
