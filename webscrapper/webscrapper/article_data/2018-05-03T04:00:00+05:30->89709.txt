Surat: Passenger traffic at Surat airport is up by a whopping 250% for the fiscal year 2017-2018. A factual data sheet by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has confirmed this and it now puts Surat on 42nd position amongst the top 50 airports in India. In terms of aircraft movement, AAI has graded it at number 37 with 137.40% growth, which has been a huge achievement for an airport that has long been struggling to be up on the aviation map of India in spite of being amongst its earliest one.  “Despite only two major airlines and one non scheduled operator (NSOP) operating from Surat, the airport has shown tremendous growth and potential. From being at number 50, it has jumped up to being number 42, clearly proving that Surtis like to fly from their own airport,” co-chairman of the SGCCI’s aviation committee Manoj Singapuri said.  “We are delighted that if Surat is showing full support by availing the present operating flights, we are looking forward to more domestic as well as international connectivity with support from the Centre,” Surat BJP MP Darshana Jardosh said. Replying to a recent inquiry by RTI activist Rajesh Modi, the AAI confirmed, “Space for ticket counter to Air Asia has been allotted in the terminal building. Air Asia will be using existing checking counters and baggage machines of AAI as per requirement. Air Asia submitted slot request application on April 24 for flight I5 1476/1475 effective from May 16 to October 27.”  “Now that even the flight numbers have been allotted, it is up to Air Asia to begin from that day or a few odd days thereafter, depending upon bird availability. Surtis will now fly directly to Bengaluru and will also be able to avail further connectivity from there to South East Asia,” Modi said. Speaking to the TOI, outgoing airport director Dilip Sajnani confirmed that commercial airline has processed all required payments and space allocation has been done for future usage.
