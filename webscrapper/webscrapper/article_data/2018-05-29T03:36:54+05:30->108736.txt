THANE: With an aim to provide education to differently-abled kids from Mumbra and its suburbs, the   (TMC) is planning a school for special children in  . 

 The proposal, which was tabled for discussion at the general body meeting this month received unanimous nod from members of the House.
 
 A survey was conducted two months ago by the officials in Mumbra and Diva wherein it was revealed that around 150 mentally and physically challenged students, who were underprivileged were unable to cope with the curriculum of civic schools.
 
 A civic official said, “After conducting the study, we decided to take help from a local non government organisation (NGO) and together brainstormed for solutions. Besides a number of private schools, there is only one civic school in Thane —  , which is solely for special children. So, we thought of setting up another such school in these areas as they cannot afford to travel to Thane. We will be collaborating with the NGO and provide them with the basic facilities.”
 
 According to plans, the civic body will be running the school with   in Mumbra, which is already imparting training to over 250 special kids from the area free of cost.
 
 Parvez Farida, president of the foundation, said, “Since the past eight years we have been working with differently-abled kids. Due to limited space, we can only accommodate 250 kids now although 200 more are on the waiting list. When TMC approached us we were thrilled. After zeroing in on the plot, work will begin immediately and hopefully the school will function by September.” The newly proposed school aims to provide children with a physiotherapy centre, vocational training and guidance, counseling sessions and academic assistance.
 
 Besides a number of private schools, there is only one civic school in Thane — Jidd School, which is solely for special children. As a result of this, we thought of setting up another such school in these areas as the kids cannot afford to travel to Thane
