Panaji: Days after chief minister Manohar Parrikar reviewed the infrastructural gaps along the Miramar-Dona Paula road, work on replacing manhole covers, cleaning and illuminating the Rs 72.59 crore stretch has started in earnest. Prior to his US trip, Parrikar had instructed the public works department (PWD), electricity department and Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP) to rectify all infrastructural lapses along the road. “The PWD, electricity department and CCP have jointly undertaken repair work along the Miramar-Dona Paula by-pass on a priority basis. The task includes installation of LED pole lights and signboards, cleaning of the footpath and cutting off tree branches which create hindrance to traffic,” a government official said. Following a series of complaints, Parrikar had held a meeting with key officials of the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), PWD and CCP and had issued instructions to ensure that shortcomings along the road be resolved, while also calling for a “long-term policy for maintenance and cleanliness of the road.” The PWD has started the work of cleaning the sewerage manholes and replacing concrete cover-rims with fibre ones. The 4.5-km concrete road was meant to provide commuters a smoother and safer ride, but due to cracks along the road and missing manholes, commuters and residents expressed concern over the occurrence of accidents and injuries.
