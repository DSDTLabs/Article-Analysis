HYDERABAD: It is not just residential or   that mushroom right under the nose of   ( ). Several hundreds of illegal small scale industrial units have come up in the peripheral circles of the Greater Hyderabad such as L B Nagar,   and Qutubullapur with GHMC’s town planning wing turning a blind eye to such industries.

 The air coolers assembling unit where the deadly fire broke out at Attapur was being run in an unauthorized construction, sans a trade license and other mandatory permissions such as the one from the state pollution control board. “The owner of the unit constructed a shed to run his unit. Since it is a shed, we did not initiate any action against the owner,” GHMC assistant city planner (Rajendrangar) K Srinivas told TOI.
 
 But official sources said the GHMC rulebook says even for erecting a shed and a compound wall, permission from the municipal corporation is required. The civic body should have closed the facility since it was an industrial unit.
 
 Interestingly, residents of   in the same municipal circle fought against illegal plastic units in the residential areas. As many as 190 units have come up in the Shastripuram and since there was no action from the municipal corporation and the pollution control board, the residents approached the high court and   a few years ago forcing the GHMC to remove about 40 units on the directions of the court. But many still continue to function. “Some plastic units are causing pollution and people suffer due to the pollution ,” N Ravi, a resident said.
 
 “The town planning wing served notices on illegal units and asked departments to disconnect their power supply. But no action has been taken by the discom,” the assistant city planner said.
