The craze around SS Rajamouli's magnum opus ' ' refuses to die down even after (almost) a year of release of the last instalment. Even after setting the Indian box-office on fire with lifetime earning of Rs 508.78 crore, it’s still not done raking in the moolah at the box-office. After completing its 100-day theatrical run in Japan recently with earnings of $1.3 million, it has been confirmed that ‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ will hit Chinese screens on May 4.

  In recent years, Indian film industry has found both fans and revenues in the Chinese market. The massive Chinese market holds a lot of potential for Indian films.  's   had minted over Rs 1200 crore, and Secret Superstar has collected Rs 750 crore. In fact, the movies performed far better in China than it did back home. However, ‘Baahubali: The Beginning’, which minted over Rs 600 crore at the worldwide box office, failed to cast a similar magic. Reportedly, it had collected only Rs 7.3.
 
  ‘Baahubali 2’ has so far minted over Rs 1700 crore at the worldwide box office, which is three times higher than the first instalment. It has to be seen if the film can strike gold at China’s box-office and reach the historical feat of Rs 2000 crore at the global box office.
