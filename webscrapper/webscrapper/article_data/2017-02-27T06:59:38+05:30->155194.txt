New Delhi: The   will now use mobile and computer games to spread road safety awareness among students of Classes VI -VIII. 

 Seeking   students' help to develop such short-duration video games, joint commissioner (traffic)   said children have become more interactive and, hence, there is a need to change the approach to reach out to them. 
 
 Addressing an annual conference, 'Watch the Road' of IIT students, she said her department will be more than happy if IITians can develop such games.
 
 The plan gains importance considering the fact that for long, the government departments and a section of road safety experts have been pushing for incorporating chapters on road safety in school curriculum. There is also a contrasting view that there is no need to put more burden on school students for some reason or the other. "Youth and children have a huge role in spreading road safety awareness in the peer group and families,"   said.
