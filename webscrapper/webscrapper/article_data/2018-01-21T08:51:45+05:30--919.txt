TRICHY: The   police in the city have begun booking motorists driving in the opposite direction on one-way streets in the last couple of days and have fined 329 motorists. Most motorists in the city have been casual in adhering to the one-way street rule.

 The McDonaldâ€™s road near the central bus stand has been a dangerous stretch for a long time as there has been lack of enforcement by the police to check violation of the rule. Motorists face the risk of being hit by buses when they carelessly enter on restricted stretches.
 
 A senior police officer in the city police said that the strict enforcement of the one-way rule was owing to rising fatal and non-fatal accidents in the city. The officer also mentioned the death of a youth on a two-wheeler after being hit by a car on the service road in   a couple of days back.
 
 The police have taken a serious view of one-way violations on the service road along the four-road from   to Y-road junction on the outskirts of Srirangam. Though there are many one-way stretches that witness see motorist drive in the wrong direction, the police have remained mute spectators on several occasions.
