SURAT: A member of   has written to chief minister   urging him to make serious effort to fill the vacant posts in various departments of the panchayats in the nine talukas of Surat district. 

 Against a total of 3,087 posts in various departments of   panchayat, about 1,066 posts are vacant. Key posts like that of chief taluka development officer, deputy district development officer, animal husbandry director, social development officer etc. are lying vacant for the last many years. 
 
  Darshan Nayak said, “I had sought information on vacant posts in the panchayat till December 2017. The reply was shocking as key posts and other 1,066 posts are vacant for the last many years. The state government talks about employment and here many unemployed youths are waiting for employment.”
 
 Nayak added, “Around 93 posts of junior clerks, 59 secretaries, 82 gram sevaks, 13 animal husbandry officers, 10 junior pharmacists, 10 laboratory technicians etc are lying vacant. Without enough staff, it is very difficult to run day-to-day affairs in the district panchayat departments.” He pointed out that the state government’s announcement on doubling the income of farmers seems to be a distant dream. “The chief minister talks about doubling the income of farmers, but he seems unaware about the increase in the prices of water, electricity, fertilizer, labour and seeds. Most of the small and marginal farmers in Surat are languishing in a pitiable condition and they need the support of the government,” Nayak added.
