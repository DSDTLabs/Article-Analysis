LUCKNOW: Referring to the prevailing tension among   and CPIM workers in Kerala as very ‘serious’, CPIM general secretary   said that it is the standard technique of the BJP and   to initiate violence and sharpen communal tension.

 “The entry of 1 BJP MLA to Kerala Legislative Assembly has emboldened the BJP, and with this, they are resorting to systematic violence. The cycle of violence is continuing, and a bomb was hurled near the public meeting of CPI-M state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, in which one person was injured,” Yechury observed, and added that this creates a retaliatory trend.
 
 He also blamed the BJP and RSS for spreading violence and creating terror among the people only to polarize the Hindutva votebank, which is the “worst form of votebank politics”.
 
 “The Kerala government has initiated talks to diffuse the tension, and we hope that the BJP and RSS participate in the talks,” he further remarked.
