Anantapur: The Anantapur police busted an old high note (OHD) racket racket and nabbed the 11-member gang, including a doctor, a police constable and a contractor, involved in it on Thursday. Members of the gang were trying to exchange   bank notes worth of Rs 1 crore for new currency. 

 The police said Tuttireddy Sarabha Reddy, main accused in the case, is a contractor who received the money from his uncle Kasepalli Krishna Reddy after his demise. Krishna Reddy had sold his lands and kept the money with himself. Sarabha Reddy came to know that his uncle had the money only after his death but by then the deadline for exchange of old currency was had ended.
 
 As the RBI has extended the time for exchange of old currency notes for NRIs, Sarabha Reddy hatched a plan with his relative and doctor Pandirlapalli Somasekhar Reddy. However, as Somasekhar Reddy had failed to exchange the currency for some reason, Sharabha Reddy approached one Sheik Nasar Vali for help. Nasar Vali, in turn, introduced Dharmavaram Eswaraiah and Guddili Anjaneyulu who works as a police constable.
 
 Anjaneyulu brokered a deal between Sarabha Reddy and Sheik Sadiq Basha who owns a garment factory in Bangalore. tnn
