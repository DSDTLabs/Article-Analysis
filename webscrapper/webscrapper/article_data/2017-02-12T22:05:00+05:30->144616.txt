MYSURU:   on Saturday accused the BJP-led NDA government of trying to destabilize Congress governments in the country, attributing the charges levelled by state   chief B S   against chief minister  .

 Referring to the charge that the CM has paid Rs 1,000 crore to the party high command, the Chamarajanagar MP said: “BJP leaders, including Yeddyurappa, are trying to create confusion among people by levelling baseless charges. Yeddyurappa should know that he was jailed when he was the chief minister.” 
 
 Dhruvanarayana asked the former chief minister to release documents, if he has any, to prove his charge. “Yeddyurappa has asserted two months ago that three ministers from the Siddaramaiah government will be forced to resign following an expose against them. What does he have to say now? Some of his ministerial colleagues were jailed, while the Congress government has restored governance in the state and has ruled the state without any scams,” he told reporters.
 
 BJP leaders have been trying to destabilize non-BJP governments in the country by making charges hoping that it will rattle the governments, he stated, pointing at constitutional crisis in Tamil Nadu. “PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah are trying to unseat the non-BJP governments,” he said, adding that they are also trying to woo senior leaders from the opposition camps.
 
 The Congress MP said that the NDA government has not released funds to address the drought situation in the state. He accused the BJP MPs of negligence and failure to prevail upon the Centre. “As against Rs 4,200 crore sought for drought relief, the Centre sanctioned Rs 1,782 crore but has released only Rs 450 crore. But the Centre has reached out to the governments in Madhya Pradesh — where it is in power — and Andhra Pradesh which is ruled by (NDA constituent) TDP. Though the Centre is blatantly meting out step-motherly treatment towards Karnataka, BJP MPs from the state are silent,” he said.
