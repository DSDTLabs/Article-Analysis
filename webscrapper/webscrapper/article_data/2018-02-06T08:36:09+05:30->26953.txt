GUWAHATI: Nine state   working in various parts of the state were on Monday summoned by   for the ongoing investigation into the cash-for-job   (APSC) scam. 

 All the officials have been asked to appear before   on Wednesday. Among the nine, two were state police officials.
 
 In June last year, at least 25 state government officials appointed through APSC were summoned and made to sit for a handwriting test, following which 24 of them were arrested on charges of taking illegal means for the selection. One of them is still absconding.
