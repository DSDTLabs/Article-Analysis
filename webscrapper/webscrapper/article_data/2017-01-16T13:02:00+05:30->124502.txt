CHANDIGARH: The bickering within   surfaced yet again after party MLAs, ex-MLAs and HPCC delegates aligned to ex-CM   skipped the meeting convened to discuss the strategy for agitation outside the RBI offices.

 Rajya Sabha MP Viplov Thakur had chaired the joint meeting of delegates of HPCC and Chandigarh Territorial   Committee (CTCC) on Sunday. Barring Mehem MLA  , who is also a HPCC member, none of the Hooda’s known supporters was present. Speaking to media, Thakur claimed said that MLAs had sought exemptions from meeting citing the personal commitments in their constituencies.
 
 During the meeting Dangi indirectly attacked Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar while asking Thakur to direct party men to not to resort to caste politics. Renuka Bishnoi also raised the issue.
 
 Besides Tanwar from Haryana prominent among those who attended the meeting were: former railway minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, and Chandigarh Congress leaders Pardeep Chhabra and Harmohinder Singh Luckey.
 
 HPCC chief Ahsok Tanwar is spearheading the agitation on the behalf of Haryana cadre. “We are expanding our base in the country very fast. You shall see that the agitations outside the RBI offices will be a great success. Our workers are hard at it to ensure success of the agitation,’’ said Thakur, while denying there any infighting in the party.
 
 Soon after the Delhi incident where Congressmen owing alliance to Hooda had allegedly attacked Tanwar couple of months back, they had told the high command about their decision to boycott all events organized by the state Congress chief.
