PUNE: A 32-year-old cellphone shop owner hanged himself to death after positioning his cellphone to record the act at his residence in   late on Saturday night. His family told the police that he was heavily in debt, which probably was the reason for the suicide.

 Haresh Peshwani put his cellphone in video-recording mode in the drawing room of his first floor apartment with the camera facing him and the ceiling fan in the backdrop. The cellphone captured a 29-minute clip, which shows him first smoking a cigarette and consuming liquor, and later tying a dupatta to the fan with the knot at the other end around his neck, senior inspector V V Mugalikar told TOI.
 
 “The video camera kept recording the suicide till someone called on the cellphone, prompting the recording to move to an auto-save action. The cellphone will be sent for a digital forensic examination,” Mugalikar said.
 
 Peshwani lived with his parents, wife and two-year-old daughter in the apartment. His family had gone out at the time of the suicide. “They found him hanging when they returned at 11pm and called the police,” Mugalikar said. 
 
 Peshwani had taken loans from moneylenders, Mugalikar said. “His family has told investigators that he had suffered heavy losses, due to which he had slipped into depression. He had also taken to drinking heavily,” he added.
 
 The police have registered a case and are investigating.
