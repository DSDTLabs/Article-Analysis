BAMBOLIM: Turning to religion or depending on destiny for success was futile, said   and co-founder of   Limited Baba   on Thursday.

 The yoga guru went on to say that youth just starting out in their career, especially in the advertising industry, should not depend on destiny for success.
 
 Speaking at GoaFest 2018, Ramdev criticised the idea of depending on destiny and religion for success in their personal or business endeavours.
 
 “I find that 99% of the people fall into the trap of destiny. Some symbol or number or time that they find auspicious. In the name of destiny, some people fall into a trap and never come out of it,” said the yoga guru.
 
 Addressing the gathering of leaders from the creative advertising space, Ramdev also appeared to mock the dependence on gods and blind adherence to religious practices. “The Muslims pray, the Hindus have their gods and gurus. If the Hindus and Muslims and the Buddhists all depend on gods, they should be successful and China should have never progressed,” Ramdev said. “After all, China does not believe in God,” he said.
 
 Instead of depending on ones destiny for success, Ramdev said that he saw several successful businessmen and political leaders blame their destiny for their difficulties and success. 
 
 “I say, first correct your bad deeds. Educated people are pouring oil on black stones. What is going to happen if you pour oil on a black stone? First change yourself,” Ramdev said.
