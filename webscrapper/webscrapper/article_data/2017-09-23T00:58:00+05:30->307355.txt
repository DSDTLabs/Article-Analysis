Erode: Unidentified burglars broke into a temple at Nasiyanur near Chithode on Salem-Coimbatore national highway in the early hours of Friday and decamped with Rs 1 lakh in   and silver ornaments worth Rs 50,000. The temple’s deity, Appathal, is the family god of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his relatives. Tamil Nadu West zone IG A Pari visited the temple and inquired with police officials. A special team has been formed to nab the accused.

 The burglary came to light when one of the priests V Sakthi, 38, came to open the temple on Friday morning to carry out daily puja. 
 
 He found the main door broken open and the lock damaged. When he entered the temple, Sakthi found the almirahs also broken open. 
 
 “We have kept Rs 1 lakh in the almirah after temple hours and other silver ornaments. Both the cash and silver ornaments are missing,” the priest said. 
 
 He immediately alerted the Chithode police. Preliminary investigations revealed that two or more people were involved in the crime. 
 
 “We have lifted finger prints from the crime spot. We will nab the accused at the earliest,” the police said. A case was registered and further investigations are on.
