BAREILLY: Uttar Pradesh   Limited (UPPCL) on Monday decided to disconnect the power supply to the   here for reportedly not   of Rs 25.69 crore.
 
  Of the total pending amount, the primary education department alone has to pay Rs 23.76 crore.
  
  UPPCL chief engineer   told TOI, “As many government departments have not paid electricity bills, we have given them the April 17 deadline. Of the total 70 government departments, we have pending power bill of Rs 85.26 crore. However, all government departments, except the education department, have paid some part of their power bills. We extended the deadline till April 30 for the education department, but it failed to deposit sum. I have told superintendent engineer to disconnect power supply.”
  
  According to data accessed by TOI, the primary education department has not paid a sum of Rs 23.76 crore, while the secondary education department is yet to deposit Rs 1.16 crore, whereas the higher education department is due to pay Rs 77.37 lakh.
  
  The power bill is highest with the primary education department as hundreds of schools and block offices are consuming power, said an official.
  
  Basic shiksha adhikari Chandana Ram Iqbal Yadav said, “We have not paid power bill as we are still waiting for budget allocation from the state government. Once we get budget, we will deposit the power bill. Just before state assembly elections, we had received a budget of Rs 12 lakh, which was paid to UPPCL.”
  
  According to UPPCL officials, power arrears cause problems in producing electricity. “UPPCL purchases coal for producing electricity. When we do not receive payment from agencies or departments, we are unable to buy sufficient quantity of coal,” they added.
