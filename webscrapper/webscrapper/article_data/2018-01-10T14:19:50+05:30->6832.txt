MANGALURU: Was Monday’s attack on a Hindu Jagarana Vedike leader fabricated? Preliminary investigations by the police point in that direction. However, a thorough investigation is on to ascertain the truth by the police.

 On Monday,   Bharath claimed that four men who were hiding behind bushes, tried to murder him. He alleged that they were brandishing swords. He was riding his two-wheeler near   at the time of the incident. The incident took place around 8.30 pm, according to him.
 
 City police commissioner   told TOI that the statements given by   are contradictory in nature. “While he had alleged that four people attacked him, a press release by the association he was affiliated to, claimed that there were three attackers. He said he can identify all the attackers and colour of the dress they were wearing. When we took him to the spot, he changed his statement, saying that he can recall the identity of only one person. There are a lot of discrepancies regarding his statement. We are investigating to find out the truth, which will take some time,” he said.
 
 He said Bharath is a rowdy-sheeter against whom five cases have been booked between 2010-2013. Most of the cases are of communal nature, including robbery.
