NEW DELHI:  said on Monday that the Modi government's downsizing of   over three years has exposed its claims about transforming the economy .

  spokesman   said, “The sad story of education is reflected in eight figures exactly co-terminus with the terms of the BJP-NDA government.“ In the wake of a TOI report published on Monday , he said the Centre's expenditure on education was 4.57% of the budget when UPA left office, but since then it has fallen to 4.14% in 2014, 3.75% in 2015, and 3.65% in 2016. He said for sake of form, the budgetary percentage this year has been increased to 3.71% of GDP.
 
 Congress said while the UPA had brought in revolutionary thoughts like Right to Education, the Modi regime was “focussed on improving HRD and education through its own distorted definitions“.
 
 Singhvi mocked that for BJP, the definition of improvement does not include enrolment ratios or provision of infrastructure but revolves around phrases which the PM is fond of.
