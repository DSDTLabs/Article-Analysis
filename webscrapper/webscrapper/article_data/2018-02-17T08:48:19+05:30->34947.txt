HYDERABAD: Chief Minister   returned to the city on Friday having spent a week in New Delhi after failing to meet Prime Minister  , who had prior appointments. On his return, KCR called on Governor ESL Narasimhan on Friday evening at   and briefed him about his visit to Delhi.

 KCR mainly went to Delhi for a dental treatment and eye-check as he had a surgery last year. He was in Delhi from February 10. For four days, he was occupied with medical check-up.
 
 Before he left for Delhi, the CM had not sought any prior appointment with Union ministers or the PM. However, since he was in Delhi and the PM too had returned from his threenation tour, he had requested for an appointment, but it did not work out. KCR also planned to meet home minister  , but eventually did not seek an appointment.
 
 On Friday, the CM hosted lunch for Union finance ministry officials. Chief economic advisor, ministry of finance,   was present. KCR had a meeting with Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, where he urged that funds meant for backward districts be released. “It would have been good had a meeting between the CM and PM worked out, but that can always be done later. This time, the CM was in Delhi mainly for medical checkups,” a TRS leader said.
