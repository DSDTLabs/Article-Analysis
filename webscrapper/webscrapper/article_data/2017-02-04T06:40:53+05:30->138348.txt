GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat’s   have been rattled by the passage of the new Gujarat State   Council Act, 2016 Act on Friday. 

 Teachers associations like the Gujarat State College and Universities Teachers’ Federation (GSCUTF) in their recent petition to the governor in May demanded that Clause 3 of chapter 2 be removed. It says that the council will have powers to do anything it wishes with the property of higher education institutes. Beside this, the   pointed out that the council in its present form is dominated and burdened with political and bureaucratic officials. 
 
  “We have demanded that it must not be headed by ministers. Besides, all the councils ‘other members’ are to be nominated by the government. We have demand that the government should invite, through public announcement,” a petition by GSCUTF said. The petition adds, “Choices for the position of ‘the other of members’ category in the council should be made via an election procedure,” says the petition.
 
 Another clause in the act that has been vehemently opposed is clause 15 which states, “On the recommendation of the council or suo moto, the state may direct, any university to implement reforms in such manner as specified.” GSCUTF claims that such a law will directly attack the academic autonomy of educational institutions. The Act also undermines elected bodies of universities as well.
