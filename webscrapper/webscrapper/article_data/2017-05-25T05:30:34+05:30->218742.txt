MUMBAI: Former minister   set tongues wagging on Wednesday after he predicted midterm polls. "I will not be surprised if Lok Sabha and state assembly elections are held together,'' Khadse told TOI. 

 Khadse obliquely criticized the  , saying that even as a series of populist measures have been taken for the public welfare, these schemes have not reached the people across the state. 
 
 "It is the party workers' responsibility to ensure that policies and schemes of the government reach the beneficiaries. I think we are lagging in implementing the schemes," said the veteran  . Addressing party workers in tribal Dhule district, he said they must be ready for elections to the Lok Sabha and state assembly at any moment. 
 
 The BJP strongman from Jalgaon, wields considerable clout in north Maharashtra among legislators from the region. He was the number two in the state cabinet, after the CM and helmed the important revenue department and other plum portfolios. 
 
 However, he had to step down from the cabinet last year due to his alleged role in a land deal in Pune. It was alleged that he misused his position as minister to secure the plot in the name of his wife and son-in-law. 
 
 Subsequently, Fadnavis had appointed Justice D S Zoting, a former Bombay high court judge, to probe charges against Khadse.
