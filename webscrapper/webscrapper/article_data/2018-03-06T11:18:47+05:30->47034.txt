GAYA: Notifying a seven-point code of conduct for   users and whatsapp group administrators and members,   DM   and SSP   have warned against the misuse of social networking sites for spreading rumours and causing social fissures.

 The joint notification was issued late Sunday evening. As per the conduct, group administrators have to be personally familiar with the profile of the members and vouch for their credentials. Only such people should become group administrators, who are ready to take the responsibility for the conduct of its members.
 
 In case of any group member posting unverified reports, rumours and other items that may cause social tension and disharmony, it will be the responsibility of the group administrator to issue a prompt denial/corrigendum and remove such irresponsible members from the group.
 
 It will also be the responsibility of the group administrator to inform police of such mischief with a request to take suitable action against such a member under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and IT Act. Failure on the part of administrators to promptly report such matters to police will be construed as connivance and such administrators will be subjected to penal action as per law.
 
 Posts, comments, videos, photographs and other items likely to hurt the feelings of any section of society and cause social disharmony will be taken very seriously and those who post or forward such objectionable items will be brought to justice, warned para 6 of the joint order. 
 
 Copies of the joint order have been sent to the divisional commissioner,   range DIG, additional collector, SDOs and SHOs of the district.
