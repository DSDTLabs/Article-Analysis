NEW DELHI: A Delhi court awarded 10 years to a man for raping, stalking and threatening his sister-in-law, observing that the convict did not mend his ways despite four FIRs lodged against him by the woman.

 “A woman who is continuously facing molestation at the hands of her ( ) who had an evil eye on her and wanted to be physical with her since his marriage with her sister, had no option but to file the complaint with the police,” additional sessions judge Renu Bhatnagar said.
 
 The court observed that the survivor had filed various complaints with the police leading to registration of four FIRs against the accused. Her helpless situation led to she falling prey in the hands of the accused, who ultimately succeeded in raping her, despite all her resistance and efforts, the court said.
 
 While slapping a Rs 15,000 fine on the convict, the court also directed the   to compensate the survivor with Rs 2 lakh observing the gravity of the offence, her mental and physical trauma, her social status and financial condition.
 
 It was alleged that the convict had forced the survivor to have sex with him and threatened to torture his wife, and kill her father and brother if she retaliated.
 
 The survivor claimed that he had raped her on December 27, 2015 following which she lodged a complaint with the police on January 6, 2016 alleging that on several occasions, he had molested her and stalked her following which she lodged various complaints.
 
 The man, however, denied all the allegations and claimed he was falsely implicated by the victim, adding that he had consensual sex with her. Rejecting his submission, the court held, “The physical relationship was under coercion and the consent was not voluntary as it was passive giving-in by the prosecutrix…clouded by the fear of threats of blackmailing by the accused.”
