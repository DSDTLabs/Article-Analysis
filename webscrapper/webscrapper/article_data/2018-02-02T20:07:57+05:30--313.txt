Beauty is how you feel inside, and it reflects in your eyes. It is not physical. This famous quote by academy award winner Sophia Loren holds true for the girls of  , who recently participated in their annual personality contest. Battling it out for the top position, the students had to withstand five rounds. Nervous and excited, they sashayed down the ramp and introduced themselves in the quirkiest way possible. The enthusiastic youngsters sitting in the audience cheered for every contestant. “It is a personality   for the final year students from all the departments of Shankar Nagar and Seminary Hills campuses. There is no other criteria such as height, for the competition. We want every student to believe that she is eligible to participate and can become the winner too. Also, participants went through a grooming session. Not just winners but every participant becomes more confident and poised post the competition,” said one of the faculty members, Dr  , who has been part of the contest since its inception. 
Even the teachers were constantly rooting for the contestants. It was also heartening to see them motivating the participants during the Q&A rounds. With great confidence, participants faced all the questions and impressed judges with their presence of mind. But it became a night to remember for the hotel management student   Chanchlani, who emerged as a winner.   Chelwani took a bow as second runner-up and   Melani was announced as first runner-up. Those who couldn’t bag the top three positions were happy to receive various sub-titles such as best smile, best hair, miss perfect 10, best skin, miss photogenic etc. Adding dollops of entertainment to the event, junior girls set the stage on fire with their enthralling dance performances and fun acts.
