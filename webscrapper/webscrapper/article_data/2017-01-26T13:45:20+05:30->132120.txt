 will witness father-son duo   and   for the first time on the couch. While Jackie appears all flamboyant on the show, Tiger is a little hesitant when it comes to talking about his personal life.

 In the second promo, Karan compliments Jackie by telling him that in his time, everyone thought he was the sexiest movie star and he always had all the female attention. To this, Jackie funnily replies, "Thank God, thank God, thank God." 
 
 
 
 Jackie Shroff goes ahead to declare that he is younger and sexier than all the young guns in the entertainment business today. While he is all out there on the show, Tiger was more shy to admit his relationships.
 
 When Karan asks him about his girlfriends in college, Tiger tells him that he just had a crush on Shraddha Kapoor, nothing else. Daddy Jackie reacts to it by saying that he didn't know that. He thought it was the other one. 
 
 Surely all chuckles and smiles, this one is going to be worth watching. Koffee With Karan airs every Sunday at 9 pm on   and Star World HD.
