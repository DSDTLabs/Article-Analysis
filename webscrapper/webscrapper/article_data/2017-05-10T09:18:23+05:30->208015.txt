While the rulebook says that TET has to be conducted twice a year, the Telangana government has clearly not adhered by that norm.
 
 “In fact now the authorities are saying that will conduct the DSC exam without giving us another chance,“ said Sunitha K, who completed her BEd in 2016, ruing how she spent about `15,000 on coaching to appear for the exam. She is among the 3,000 odd candidates whose TET 2016 results have been withheld for failing to appropriately fill (or darken) their OMR sheets. Another three lakh candidates, who have completed their BEd or DEd are also waiting for the TET notification as it is a qualifying exam for DSC.
 
 The government, however, is adamant. “We don't see a reason why we should conduct TET again before DSC as all the candidates were given a chance to qualify in the exam. It's not our mistake if they failed to clear it,“ said S Jagannath Reddy , ex-officio director, TS ­TET and added that they can't do anything much about withheld results either as there is no way to evaluate them.
