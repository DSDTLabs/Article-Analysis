 who made a spectacular debut on television as the host of the first season of Bigg Boss Telugu in 2017 has opted out of the second season which will begin later this year. Apparently, NTR and his wife   are expecting their second child. The couple is already blessed with a cute little boy  . The actor is currently committed to a Trivikram Srinivas directorial following which he also has a project lined up with SS Rajamouli. The final schedules of both the films are yet to be worked out and once they go on floors, the actor will be hard pressed to spend quality time with his family. “Given the uncertainty around the schedules of these big-ticket projects and the fact that he is about to become a father again, NTR has decided not to host the second season of Bigg Boss. He wants to be with his better half when the D-day arrives,” said a source close to the actor, adding, “He was offered highly flexible terms by the channel with whom he shares a great rapport but decided against it after deliberation.”
Meanwhile, the channel is said to be on the hunt for a replacement. “Yes, Tarak has created a mark for himself and it is not an easy task to find someone who can match his ability as a Bigg Boss host. When shooting for the first season in  , he actually completed two episodes in four hours, he is that good,” said a source from the channel.
