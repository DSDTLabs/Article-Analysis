MUMBAI:   Corporation, owned by India-born, Indonesian billionaire Sri Prakash Lohia, may buy the phosphatic fertiliser business of   for Rs 400-500 crore as the diversified enterprise looks to expand its presence in Asia's third largest economy.

 The corporation's   subsidiary has entered into an exclusive agreement with Tata Chemicals for discussions through October 31 to acquire the latter's   unit in West Bengal and the phosphatic fertiliser brands.
 
 A statement issued by Tata Chemicals to the bourses confirmed months of speculation over negotiations between the company and Indorama Corporation. The statement also said that there is no certainty that a transaction will occur.
 
 If the deal is sealed, it will mark Lohia's entry into the Indian fertiliser market. The brother-in-law of steel tycoon   has a large fertiliser business in Africa.
 
 It is not clear whether discussions also include Indorama buying Tata Chemicals' 33% interest in Indo Maroc Phosphore, a company based in Morocco that sources phosphoric acid, an important raw material for manufacturing phosphatic fertiliser.
 
 Last year, Tata Chemicals sold its urea business to  's Yara for Rs 2,670 crore.
