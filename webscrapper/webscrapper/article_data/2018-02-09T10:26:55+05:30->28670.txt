PUNE: Underprivileged citizens of the city will soon be losing out on the financial help offered by   because its elected members have decided to scrap four  , including those for differently abled, widows and senior citizens.

 “The all-party committee took the decision to shut down the schemes because of lack of funds with the civic administration,” said  , the mayor of Pune Municipal   (PMC).
 
 The schemes to be stopped include the   (scheme for destitute women), Sharad Swavlamban Yojana (scheme for senior citizens), Baba Amte Vikalang Yojana (scheme for the differently abled) and   (financial help for women). Most of these schemes were introduced in civic budgets during the past few years. PMC officials stated that over 25,000 citizens had applied for these schemes.
 
 According to the civic officials, the civic body needs to spend around Rs15 crore to implement these schemes. But only around Rs5 crore has been set aside in the budget for these.
 
 The issue to allot the remaining money by diverting funds from other projects was tabled before the all-party committee. The decision to scrap the schemes was taken while discussing it. The Rs5 crore allotted to the schemes would now be diverted to some other projects.
 
 A group of elected members, including the   and the   leaders, were not in favour of scrapping the schemes. The leader of opposition,  , demanded rollback of the decision. He also said the civic body should arrange funds for the schemes.
 
 “Many people have approached us for help after we launched the schemes. Not giving them the promised help is wrong. The civic body should divert funds to provide assistance to the applicants,” he said.
 
 The scrapping of the four welfare schemes would hurt many people from the underpriviliged section of the society, stressed some activists. One among them said the corporation should have continued with the schemes by diverting funds from other projects.
