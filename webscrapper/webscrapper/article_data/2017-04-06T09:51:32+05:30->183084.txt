LUCKNOW: Those who cannot afford paying a one-time amount for a new meter connection can now get it on EMI. The energy department has started the   scheme for those without a meter connections in cities and villages.

 The scheme was introduced in 1997 and then again in 2008 to increase the base of power consumers and to earn revenue. However, it was temporarily stopped after both stints. It has now been revived and the order dated March 30 has been issued to all distribution companies. 
 
 Since BPL consumers without connection are already beneficiaries under a centrally sponsored scheme, the state government will give new connections on EMIs to   (above poverty line) category consumers in urban and rural areas.
 
 Instalments will be realised up to 12 months from rural consumers and up to 16 months from urban consumers along with the monthly bill. There will be a nominal one-time payment too. The EMI scheme is for connections up to 1Kw and 2Kw as of now.
 
 “We are planning to extend the scheme to up to 4Kw connections,” said UPPCL MD Vishal Chauhan. 
 
 To avail the scheme, consumers can take forms from the energy department offices in their areas. 
 
 For a 1Kw connection, a rural consumer pays Rs 1,330. Under the EMI scheme, a one-time payment of Rs 130 and EMI of Rs 100 for up to 12 months will be charged. For a 2Kw connection, one-time payment of Rs 250 and 12 EMIs of Rs 100 will be charged. 
 
 In urban areas, 1Kw connection will be given for a one-time payment of Rs 205 and Rs 1,600 will be payable in EMIs of Rs 100 for 16 months. A 2Kw connection will be given for a one-time payment of Rs 625 and 16 monthly instalments of Rs 100 each. 
 
 According to a July 2016 report of the  , about 71% households in rural areas and 19% households in urban areas in UP do not have access to electricity. “We appreciate the move and demand that ‘katiya’ connections be dealt with strictly. Those who do not have meter connections are using ‘katiya’,” said All India Power Engineers’ Federation chairman Shailendra Dubey.
