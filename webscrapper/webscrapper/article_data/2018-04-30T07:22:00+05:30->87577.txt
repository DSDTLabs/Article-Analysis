Ludhiana: Khanna police have arrested a Romanian man for alleged possession of 1,000 Euros in counterfeit currency.

 The man, identified as Simion, was arrested after he was caught trying to exchange the counterfeits for Indian currency at a forex-exchange shop in Samrala.
 
 Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal said they will now question the family in Samrala in whose house the accused was living as a tenant.
 
 He added that they would produce the accused in court on Monday and seek his custody to ascertain the source of the counterfeit currency.
 
 Simion (20) has been booked under sections 420 (cheating) and 489-C (possession of forged or counterfeit currency notes) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Khanna city police station.
 
 The SSP said they had informed the Romanian Embassy in New Delhi about. He added that the accused had gone to the shop dressed as a woman. “As soon as the money exchanger gave the accused Rs 79,000 in exchange for the 1,000 Euros and then started counting the European currency, the accused tried to walk out,” the SSP said.
 
 The money exchanger got suspicious of the accused and asked him to stop. On checking the currency, he realized that they were counterfeits.
 
 The SSP said the accused had told the police that he got the Euros from his country and did not know that they were counterfeit. “The accused has studied up to high school and is unemployed,” said the SSP.

 Khanna SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said the accused had come to travel in India. “A Mauritius national had also been staying in the same house where the accused was living, but the Romanian national didn not know much about him,” he said.
