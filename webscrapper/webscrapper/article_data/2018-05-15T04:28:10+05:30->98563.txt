MUMBAI: In a first for the city, the   on Monday started installing floating trash brooms that are expected to arrest floating garbage like thermocol and plastic, preventing them from entering the sea. 

 On Monday, the first trash broom was installed at the   pumping station. Civic officials said that in all seven trash brooms will be installed by June 2, before the onset of the monsoon. The locations will be: Dahisar, Poisar, Oshiwara, Mithi River, Mogra Nullah, and Lovegrove pumping station. The set of mega brooms were bought in Kolkata for Rs.1.1 crore.
 
 V Khankar, the BMC's chief engineer of storm water drains (SWD) said the trash brooms will be placed at critical locations close to river or nullah outfalls into the sea or creek. "At present, garbage from nullahs and rivers enter the sea, only to be deposited on the beaches. We hope that once the brooms are installed, this will not occur," he said. It may be recollected that the civic commissioner, in the BMC budget earlier this year, had proposed bringing in trash brooms.
 
 BJP MLA Ameet  , who was present during the installation of the Irla pumping station trash broom on Monday, said that in October last year, he had taken up the matter of installing giant water brooms with the municipal commissioner and the chief minister. In a letter to Satam, the SWD department has said that upon the successful installation of trash brooms at the designated locations, and observing their benefit to the marine environment, the civic body would undertake such work on a large scale, including mechanical collection of trash. "This was much needed and I am glad that the civic body has implemented the suggestion. Just beach cleaning is not a solution and it was essential that steps were taken to arrest garbage at source. We are also working on a comprehensive beach cleaning policy for both Juhu and  ," said Satam.
