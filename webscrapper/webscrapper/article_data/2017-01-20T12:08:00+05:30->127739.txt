KOCHI: The high court has declined to interfere with the probe launched against a lawyer for revealing the name and details of a   who was victim of sexual abuse through Facebook. 

 Though the lawyer contended that the information was published without any mala fide intention, but was aimed at the culprit, court said intention doesn't matter as per the relevant law.
 
 A single bench of the high court considered a petition filed by advocate Sudheesh Kumar SR of Vaikuntam Law Chambers at Kannippuram Road, opposite to court complex at Neyyattinkara in Thiruvananthapuram. The lawyer had challenged an order passed by Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on August 22 last year for conducting an enquiry against him and take appropriate action as per Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
 
 Rejecting the lawyer's contention that there was no mala fide or illegal intention behind the Facebook post, the court said an offence is committed by mere publication of details of the victim as per the Act.
