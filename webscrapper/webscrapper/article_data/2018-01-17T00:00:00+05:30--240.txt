While   and   have starred together in several films, their pairing in 3 Gante 30 Dina 30 Second in unique. Devaraj is Capt. Sundaram in the film, who is a blind, and speech and hearing impaired war veteran, and Sudha is Sulochana, his wife of 25 years. Their track in the film comes at a critical juncture, and transforms the hero ( ) and heroine’s ( ) characters.

 Shedding more light, director   tells us, “Capt. Sundaram fought in the India-Pakistan war, and although his valour helped India win the war, he lost his sight, speech and hearing due to injuries sustained during the war. A person could lose their mind in such a situation, but Sulochana (played by Sudha) is so moved by his love for the nation that she marries him, resulting in a happy marriage of 25 years. Over the years, they develop their own mode of communication — through touch — and even fight and joke in this form. It’s heartening to see them together onscreen.”
