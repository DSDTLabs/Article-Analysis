HYDERABAD: Despite a standing order of a district consumer forum, directing all in the city last month to sell bottled water only at its maximum retail price (MRP), these commercial establishments continue to fleece cine-goers by overcharging the product. A quick scan of the multiple complaints pouring in from across Hyderabad show that a Rs 20 bottle of water is sold for up to Rs 50 in theatres.

 The forum's order had come after a complainant dragged INOX multiplex in   to court for not being allowed to carry his own water bottle inside the theatre. The complainant,  , also rued how he was charged Rs 50 for a bottle of water inside the multiplex.
 
 Gopal clearly isn't the only one feeling the pinch.Bhushan T, for instance, also paid `50 for a bottle of water at a multiplex in Kachiguda on May 20. “I bought a water bottle at Kachiguda INOX, thinking that they must be honouring the court order of selling at MRP. But, I was shocked to see that they have changed the MRP itself," said Bhushan.Srinath Nagella too had a similar experience. 
 
 His tweet read: “Dear@IndiaCinepolis, would you stop selling water bottle above MRP or should I go to consumer court? Forgot INOX Hyderabad case?" While Cinepolis replied saying that “the issue of MRP is under challenge before various high courts and Supreme Court of the country" and that it would “comply with the required changes, if any, once there is a specific direction from the court in this regard", it failed to amuse  
 
 In fact, residents said incidences of overcharging on water bottles were not isolated to theatres and multiplexes. The scene in restaurants, bars and various other public places was much the same, they said. “While a bottle of mineral water costs Rs `outside, I had to cough up Rs 50 at an upmarket restaurant in  ," said  , a software company employee.
