AHMEDABAD: Water contamination in municipal supply lines is increasing, despite greater budgetary allocation, and preventive measures like chlorination at both source and tail-end of supply lines. The number of unfit samples since January across the city till the first week of May this year was 709, of the total 10,519 samples taken this year. This has already crossed the number of unfit water samples observed for the entire 2015, which was 681 unfit samples out of the 46,484 samples taken back then.

 It does not end there, the number of unfit samples doubled in two years. 
  
  
 In 2016 the number of unfit samples was 1,082 while in 2017 the unfit samples almost doubled to 2,023. The data has worried   (AMC) engineering department. “Many water lines need to be replaced. An assessment is being carried out,” admitted a senior   official.
 
 The   tests approximately 6,500 to 7,000 samples every month for faecal indicators every day. The water samples for the laboratory tests are collected arbitrarily during morning supply hours from select slum clusters, municipal schools, public offices, and on complaints from residents. 
 
 Of great concern to citizens is the fact that hardly any housing society cluster is covered by the sampling process. 
 
 The water samples are subjected to basic physical and chemical analysis. “We have suggested that water sampling process in the city needs to include periodic surveys of water actually consumed by citizens,” said a senior member of AMC’s health committee.
 
 According to officials, sanitary inspectors of every ward send at least two water samples to the CWTL for tests according to routine, where the 10-Orthotoludene field tests for residual chlorine is carried out. 
 
 Also, the fortnightly report posted by the laboratory on its website does not mention tests for heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, and nitrates, trihalothanes and fluorides and advanced microbial tests for bacteriophages and spores.
