SHIMLA: The   high court on Tuesday directed the Kangra deputy commissioner to demolish a shopping mall constructed illegally along the railway tracks in   area of Kangra district. It also directed the officer to bear the cost of demolition from the encroacher.

 In an order issued on Monday, a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Ajay Mohan Goel said it was evident from the state government’s response that the mall had been built on government land.
 
 Senior council Jyotsna Rewal Dua pointed out that no permission can be granted for the construction of mall, as it was in gross violation of the provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Road Infrastructure Protection Act, 2002, the Himachal Pradesh Roadside Land Control Act, 1968, as also the Regulations/Rules/Instructions of the Railway Authorities. 
 
 Referring to the affidavit filed by the officer who had been directed to personally inspect the railway track, the division bench pointed out that it was not in consonance with earlier directions of the court. “Either the officer has not understood our directions or he is deliberately trying to conceal the relevant information. We were categorical that after personally inspecting the railway track, the officer, with the help of other officials, was to identify as to in what manner, the rules, regulations and bylaws, as framed by the railways, stand violated by private citizens in either raising construction over land belonging to the railways or raising construction on their private land in violation of the regulations framed by the railway,” the court said. 
 
 The court has directed Sushil Kumar, senior divisional engineer-II, Ferozepur, Fakhruddin Ali Amad, senior divisional engineer-IV, Ambala, and Shalinder Kumar, senior divisional engineer-III,   to personally remain present in court on the next date of hearing.
