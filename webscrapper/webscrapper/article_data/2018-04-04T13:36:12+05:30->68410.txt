PANAJI: The   municipal market tenant association has requested the   ( ) for more time to completely do away with plastic. Although many traders in the market have stopped using plastic, there are others including those selling fish, meat, pulses and vegetables who have found it difficult to give it up overnight.

 “We know that plastic causes pollution and we support the ban, but we cannot stop immediately. Both the traders and customers need to be given some time to adjust. If plastic is banned, the government should provide us with alternatives. The government must support us and supply cloth bags and other alternatives to traders at subsidized rates,” president of the association, Rajendra Damaskar told TOI.
 
 He criticized the registration fee of Rs 4,000 per month being charged to disburse plastic bags above 50 microns, saying it is not the right way to handle the plastic problem. “If the government is really serious on doing away with plastic, it should stop the big factories from manufacturing them,” he said.
 
 Vendors at the market were seen using old newspapers to wrap up some fruit and vegetables.  , a vegetable vendor at the market, said he already stopped using plastic. “People aren’t careful and throw the bags everywhere. During the monsoon, they end up in the drains,” he said, adding that customers will have to go back to carrying their own cloth bags to the market. “The ban should be such that plastic bags are not available anywhere. Then only will the customers stop asking us for them,” he said.
 
 A vendor, who uses almost 200 plastic bags daily, said it was unfair that those who could afford to pay Rs 48,000 are allowed to sell plastic above 50 microns.
