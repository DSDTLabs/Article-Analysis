PUNE: Australian skipper  , as part of   and now Rising Pune Supergiant, has perhaps played the most number of matches at the   in Gahunje than any of his   contemporaries. His 109 in the second innings of the first Test against India doesn't come as a surprise, even if the wicket was rated 'poor' by match referee  .

 Despite the label, Smith seems to have no problem with the wicket at his IPL team's home ground. "Though it was different for the Test, if you look at the T20 games that we played here last, even the One-dayers for that matter, the wickets played pretty well. It has been a good wicket for the shorter formats. We will have to wait for a couple of games to see how it behaves now," Smith said when asked whether the status of the pitch has changed since the Test.
 
 The Australian will be replacing   as captain for this season of the league. He believes things will be good with the former India captain around. "He (Dhoni) is a fantastic player and has been playing for a very long time. I am sure he is going to have a great impact for us in this season of IPL. He has scored some runs and is coming in with a great form. Hopefully he can bring that form to the Pune side," Smith said.
 
 Asked how he was looking to use Dhoni's experience as a captain, he said, "He has been there since long and has been a terrific leader. It will be great to have him around to help me out as he is a respected player in India and outside too."
 
 Smith, who made his Test debut as a spinner, wants to roll his arm over too in the IPL. "Perks of being a captain is you can bowl whenever you want. " On a serious note, it has been a conscious effort to focus more on my batting, but we will see how we go ahead, and you never know (if I bowl)," said the part-time leggie.
