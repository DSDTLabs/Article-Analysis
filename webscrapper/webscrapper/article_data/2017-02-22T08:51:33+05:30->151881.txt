CHARMINAR: Angry residents of Hill colony on Tuesday protested against   (GHMC) for failing to provide proper drainage system in Mehdipatnam.
Failure on the part of the GHMC to construct a proper drainage system in the area is taking a heavy toll on locals, who say a proposed drainage water project, which was supposed to take off long time ago, has not seen the light of day yet.
 
 The problem was compounded by a defunct drainage system in the areas which cause immense problems to everyone passing through the lane, especially students, elderly people and office-goers.
 
 “A pungent smell fills the area. We have requested the authorities to undertake cleaning of the drains. However, no action has been taken so far,''  , a local resident of Hill colony said.
 
 “In absence of a proper drainage facility, sewerage overflows in lanes and bylanes. It has become difficult for us to even venture out of our homes. The matter was brought to the notice of the authorities concerned but no proper steps have been taken to solve it permanently,'' said Dr  , a resident of Hill colony at Mehdipatnam.
 
 According to traders, overflowing drainage water accumulates on the busy road in front of hospitals and the Mehdipatnam depot, forcing people to avoid the road. There are many eateries aong the road, but customers avoid them.“This apathy cannot be tolerated anymore. The GHMC should take immediate actions to put us out of our woes,“ he added.
