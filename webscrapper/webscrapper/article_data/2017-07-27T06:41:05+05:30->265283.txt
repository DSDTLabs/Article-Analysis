HYDERABAD:   Charmme Kaur (Surdeep Kaur) on Wednesday maintained a stoic silence for most of the questions posed by Special Investigation Team (SIT) over her alleged links to drug peddlers. Even to some questions during her over six-hour interrogation, the actress replied in mono syllables.

 Charmme, who confidently strode into the Abkari Bhavan around 10 am, was wellprepared and was in a denial mode from the word go. She denied ever abusing drugs, denied knowing   Calvin Mascarenhas and denied going to parties.
 
 “She used her discretion, whether to reply or not, to many of the questions. For some questions, she just kept silent.
 
 Earlier, she had to squeeze through a crowd, before entering the SIT office. Though there were allegations of misconduct by a security guard, excise officials issued a denial.
 
 Speaking to TOI, her advocate P Vishnuvardhana Reddy said, “I am yet to speak to my client. As far as I know, there was no such problem.“
 
 Clad in a blue dress, Charmme did a namaste to reporters, before entering the office.
 
 As the high court already directed the SIT that Charmme cannot be questioned beyond 5 pm, she was allowed to leave 15 minutes before the deadline.
 
 She left the premises without talking to the media, unlike other actors. On directions of high court, she was questioned by three women officers, BL Renuka, V Jaya Lakshmi, Ch Shravani and assistant prohibition & excise superintendent K Pavan Kumar. She also refused to give her blood, hair, nail samples in line with the court directives.
 
 Meanwhile, two other persons Sachin Dhavan and,   Salman were also questioned by   on Wednesday.
