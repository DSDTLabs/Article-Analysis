This year, the   makers are trying hard to give a unique look to   effigies. Be it a Ravan with 20 hands or a pot-bellied  , the effigies in   will have different features this time. Unlike last year, when a few effigy makers used velvet cloth to protect the effigies from rain, this year the artists are using waterproof hard paint to make the effigies look attractive.

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Girish Bari, who makes the effigies for the fair in Premnagar, says, “Doon and rains have an everlasting relationship. It can rain any time here. To avoid the damage, we used velvet clothes to make the dress of the Ravan last year, but since we wanted something better this time, we used hard paint. The paint doesn’t just protect the effigy from rain, but will also make it look more attractive and shiny. “
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Ishant Sharma, a member of the Banu community, the community which makes effigy for one of the biggest Dussehra fair in Doon at Parade Ground, says, “We make one of the biggest effigies of Ravan for the fair at the Parade ground. This year, we have tried to make our effigies look more attractive and different from the effigies that we make every year. We have made the Ravan’s effigy with 20 hands to give it a giant look. Also, we have given a pot-belly to Kumbhakaran effigy this year.”
