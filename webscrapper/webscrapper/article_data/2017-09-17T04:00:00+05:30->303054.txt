Vadodara: Nirav Jebaliya, son of retired to cop, was arrested by Nandesari police on Saturday after he surrendered in connection with a cheating case registered in July this year.

 Jebaliya, son of BS Jebaliya – an IPS officer who was IGP (prisons) and retired from the police department earlier this year, was booked for not paying rent of Rs 2.40 lakh of a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that he had in his possession since 11 months. Police said that Jebaliya had taken the car on rent from the complainant Mokamsinh Gohil, a resident of Angadh village in Vadodara taluka. He used this car to provide taxi service to government office. Gohil told the cops that he gave his vehicle to Jebaliya in November last year on the rent of Rs 3,500 per month. The rent was fixed at Rs 3,500 per month and it was to be paid every two months.
 
 After not paying the rent of the car for months, Jebaliya gave a cheque to Gohil in April this year but it bounced. When Gohil asked him to return the car, Jebaliya kept dilly-dallying after which the former approached the cops. However, the police had not arrested him.
 
 Jebaliya then approached the court for anticipatory bail but the court turned down his plea and asked him to present himself before the court. After the court’s direction, Jebaliya turned himself in at Nandesari police station and the cops arrested him.
