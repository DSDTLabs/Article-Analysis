Pune: Even as the driver remained seated in the car, unidentified miscreants flicked a bag containing a laptop from the rear seat of the vehicle outside Panchali Hotel on JM Road between 12.15pm and 12.30pm on Tuesday.

 The owner of the laptop Kishore Golesar (49), a resident of New Delhi, has registered an FIR against the unidentified men with the Shivajinagar police station.
 
 Golesar is the deputy general manager at an electronics company and his work often brings him to Pune. After reaching the city on Tuesday morning, Golesar hired a car on rent to reach Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) at Kothrud.
 
 On the way, at around 12.15pm, he stopped at Panchali Hotel for some tea and refreshments. He left the laptop on the rear seat of the vehicle after the driver assured him that he would keep an eye on the bag. When he returned about 15 minutes later, he found that the bag was missing.
 
 Golesar said, “The incident occurred because of the driver’s negligence. The driver claimed to be clueless about how the bag was stolen even though he was seated inside the vehicle. I suspect that the miscreants opened the rear door to steal the bag.”
 
 The complainant claimed that when he asked the driver if he had heard the door opening and shutting, he claimed to be ignorant. “He could not give a satisfactory explanation on how the theft took place in his presence,” Golesar said. “Several CCTVs have been installed on JM Road. However, the police did not show me any footage where the thieves may have been caught in action,” the complainant added. 
 
 The Shivajinagar police has registered a complaint against the men under Section 379 (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector Prabhakar Shinde said, “We have initiated an investigation. The crime branch is also conducting a parallel investigation in the matter.. We hope to detect the case at the earliest.”
