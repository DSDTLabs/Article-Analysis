 Lucknow: Some goat dealers who were grooming exotic breeds for Bakrid have had to sell their prized possession due to the shortage of local breeds in the market. Ainul Qureshi, a goat supplier, said last year he got 40 goats of exotic breeds like Alwar and Ajmeri. “I was grooming them for Bakrid when they would’ve fetched me good prices. However, I was forced to sell 12 of them when a buyer pleaded he needed them for a marriage party. I gave him goat for Rs 15,000 each, almost half the price I would have got in Bakrid.” 
 
 Zubeen, another dealer, had to sell 14 goats of exotic Totapari breed at Rs 2.8 lakh. “I would have easily got over Rs 5 lakh in Bakrid,” he said.
 
 Anwar Qureshi, a dealer from Turiaganj, who owns 35   said, “Dealers buy kids from Rajasthan and spend huge amount on their grooming, so that they can make a profit on festival. But I was forced to sell four goats at Rs 18,000 each.” 
 
 Nadeem, another goat supplier in Turiaganj, said, “I got three orders for 15 Alwar goats in two days, but I provided only 10 because we have to save some exotic breeds for festival also.”
