 These lawyers have been voicing their grouse against the “anomaly” to senior functionaries of the RSS for the past three days and now they have taken up the issue with top government authorities, said sources. 
 
 Several protesting lawyers claimed the list was prepared in such a hurry that names of some advocates were mentioned twice. 
 
 When contacted, Pathak told TOI he was not aware of who all had been appointed government counsel. “I was not intimated about the list and came to know it through media. I have informed the chief minister (Aditya Nath Yogi) about it and he is considering the matter seriously,” Pathak told TOI. 
 
 Senior advocate C B Pandey expressed surprise over the minister’s statement and said as per business rule, he is the head of the law department on behalf of the chief minister. “If he has not approved the list, it must have been by the CM,” said Pandey. 
 
 When contacted, advocate general Raghvendra Singh said everyone cannot be made happy. “There will always be resentment among a few. More than allegiance to a party or organisation, competency is the criteria for appointment,” Singh told TOI.
