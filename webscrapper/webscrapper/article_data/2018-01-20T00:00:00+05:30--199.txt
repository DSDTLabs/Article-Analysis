Dancer  ,   singer   and Rajesh PI of The Actors Collective are collaborating for a unique performance that will see Gayatri dancing, Sujata singing live and seven of Rajesh’s actors. Called Rendezvous... Connecting The Dots, the performance, which is structured like a play, is an experiment of how meaningful conversations can emerge between movement, classical singing and theatre.

 “Gayatri and Sujata got together up last year for a performance, and this year, we put our heads together to see how all three of us could collaborate. We thought, let’s use literature as well, and went through a lot of great works, from  , the works of   and Mahabharata, which we have incorporated in the performance,” says Rajesh.
 
 The piece looks at the disconnect that exists today, thanks to our addiction to technology. “Because we are on our gadgets all the time, we are not looking at what is out there — at art in everyday life. This is a process to sensitize ourselves to the larger art out there,” adds Rajesh.
 
 Rendezvous… speaks about a variety of issues, from sexual harassment to child abuse and more. “We take a peek into the Mahabharata — into the molestation and the apathy around it. There is also a piece about women reclaiming their space, in which a female actor asks, ‘Who has a tampon?’ and a tampon magically appears. It’s a lot like how one would casually ask for a cigarette. There are multiple layers within a larger performance, and how art can bring them to the foreground,” says Rajesh.
 
 The non-ticketed work-in-progress performance will be staged this evening at Lahe Lahe, which will be followed by an informal interaction with the audience to get their viewpoints. The aim, says Rajesh, is to develop the performance further to stage it this time next year.
