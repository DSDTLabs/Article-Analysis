GURUGRAM: Commuters who have started using the Delhi to Jaipur side of the   flyover which was opened on a trial basis on Wednesday have complained that there are no   or   on the   while the crash barriers are too low, all of which can cause major accidents. 

 However, according to the   officials, the pending work will be completed soon. NN Giri, project director, GM (technical), Jaipur, said, “We have opened the flyover on a trial basis but all pending work will be completed. Streetlights will be installed in a month. Road markers will be put up within the next three days.” According to sources, NHAI was not prepared to open the flyover so soon but were did so under immense political pressure.
 
 The opening of the flyover had been slated for 2011 but it got delayed as NHAI got the forest clearance for the project much later in 2015. So, after seven years of delay, one side of the flyover was finally thrown open for commuters on Wednesday while the   side would be operational within the next two weeks. 
 
 However, commuters are worried about their safety on the 800-m flyover which doesn’t have streetlights or road markings to show the way. 
 
 On the other hand, the crash barriers on the sides of the flyover are so low that any car can fall off the edge. 
 
 Sadhna Arya, a resident of Sector 82, Gurugram, said, “I was on my way to Gurugram when I saw that the flyover doesn’t have any streetlights. How can the authorities open a flyover which lacks the basic infrastructure? If an accident happens on this flyover, who will take the onus? Additionally, how are cars supposed to move on this flyover in the night?” Shekhar Sinha, a resident of Sector 92, said, “The authorities should not have opened the flyover, even on a trial basis, without completing the project.”
 
 TOI has learnt that NHAI was under immense political pressure to open the flyover as commuters were facing huge jams at IMT Chowk daily. So, it was opened without installing basic facilities.
