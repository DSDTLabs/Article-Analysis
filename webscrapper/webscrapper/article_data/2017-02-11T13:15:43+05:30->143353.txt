PANAJI: Tourism department’s   has taken a hit for the financial year 2016-17. While Goa tourism missed out on the electronic dance music (EDM) festival in December 2016, it has been more careful in sanctioning other beach event proposals, lest they invite the wrath of the   (NGT).

 It has stopped issuing permissions to beach weddings unless an applicant has obtained prior permission from   Management Authority (GCZMA).
 
 The   charges for all events held on beaches. Goa has emerged as a ‘happening wedding destination’, but delays in getting permission might affect its image, feels tourism stakeholders.
 
 Till January-end, for financial year 2016-17, the direct revenue collected by the tourism department stood at Rs 3.57 crore, while for 2015-16, it was Rs 6.73 crore.
 
 The tourism department charged Rs 1 crore as fee for an EDM. The two EDMs – Sunburn and Supersonic – which were regularly held in Goa during the last few years were not organized in Goa in December 2016. The organizers of Supersonic did not even apply while the Sunburn organizers, though keen, pulled out and held the event in Pune. 
 
 “Rupees two crore from EDMs did not come into our kitty,” said a tourism officer, adding that revenue collection has dropped for the current fiscal year.
 
 While for financial year 2014-15, tourism department collected Rs 11.78 crore as direct revenue, the officer said the jump was a result of close to Rs 4 crore coming into the kitty from sale of scrap from the remnants of River Princess.
 
 There has been a consistent rise in revenue since 2012-13, until the dip in the current fiscal year. Revenues went up because fees of trade services related to licences for shacks and others were hiked significantly. The officer said the department had proposed a hike in all trade services, and it was being vetted by the law department. In all probability, it will be finalized when new government takes over, he said.
