HYDERABAD: The count of dengue cases in the city continued to rise through the week, with as many as 15 patients testing positive for dengue on September 15 alone. The total count from across   stood at 30, the same day.

 While admitting to a phenomenal increase in the spread of dengue this year, health experts fear that the actual count of cases could be much higher, considering a bulk of them go unreported. “The numbers seem to be a gross underestimate of the actual number of dengue fever cases coming in. Since dengue tests can be performed in most diagnostic centres, many cases might not be reported to the health department authorities,“ said Dr  , consultant general physician,   who gets five to six dengue patients each day .
 
 As it turns out, between September 11 and September 15, Telangana reported a high 150 cases of dengue -a majo rity of them being diagnosed from Hyderabad.
 
 Yet, the numbers are deceptive, health experts stress highlighting the lack of awareness among the medical fraternity , about the method of diagnosis, as another reason for it. “Diagnosis during the different stages of dengue needs to be done by using different methods. Any fever with platelet count can be a dengue case and needs to be tested.   wever, majority of the patients can recover without hospitalisation. A few who have dengue haemorrhagic fever need hospitalised care,“ said a senior official from the state health department.
 
 Dengue is meanwhile, characterised by high fever, headaches, abdominal pain, vomiting, rashes, rapid breathing, fatigue, muscles and joint pains and can be life threatening in serious cases.
