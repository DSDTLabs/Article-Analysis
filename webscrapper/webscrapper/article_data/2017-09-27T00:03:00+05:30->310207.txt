Mohali: The police on Tuesday accessed the bank locker of 92-year-old Gurcharan Kaur, who and her journalist son K J Singh, 64, were found murdered at their Phase 3B2 house on September 23.

 Police sources said besides jewellery, the locker contained a legal will made by Kaur. Her husband in 1992 had transferred the house in her name.
 
 The police have also collected footage from 18 CCTV cameras installed in residential as well as commercial area near the house of K J Singh. However, cops were yet to find the car and a mobile phone stolen by the assailants after killing the two.
 
 The police have questioned over 30 people, including family members. A cover found from a park next to the house of K J Singh on Monday was that of a 3-inche long knife, dashing the hopes of the police that it had to do something with the double murder.
 
 SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “We have deployed teams to work on various theories. We are hopeful of cracking the case. Anything at this stage cannot be revealed.”
