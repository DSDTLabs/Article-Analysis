PATIALA: An additional sessions judge here suspended the two-year jail term awarded to Punjabi singer Daler   in a human trafficking case dating to 2003 on Friday. 

 Patiala additional sessions judge Rajeev Kalra suspended the jail term after it allowed Mehndi’s lawyer to challenge the conviction. 
 
 The court summoned all records pertaining to the case and fixed May 18 as the next date of hearing.
 
 It also granted bail to the pop singer till the disposal of the case and asked him to furnish a Rs 50,000 bail bond. Defence counsel   said they had filed the appeal before the appellant court on Wednesday and it was taken up for hearing Saturday. 
 
 After being convicted and sentenced to two years in prison by the court of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) Nidhi Saini on March 16,   had been granted bail by the trial court for filing an appeal in a higher court.
 
 He had been found guilty under sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Police had registered the case in 2003, on a complaint by Bakshish Singh, a native of Punjab’s Balbehra village, who accused Daler and his brother  , who died last year, of not keeping their promise of sending him abroad and not returning his money. 
 
 It was alleged that Mehndi, Shamsher and others had duped several people with the promise of relocating them to the US, by charging hefty sums. 
 
 They had been accused of providing illegal passage abroad to people by passing them off as members of the singer’s troupe. Mehndi brothers had taken two troupes to the US in 1998 and 1999, and illegally “dropped” 10 people there.
