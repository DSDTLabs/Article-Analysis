SHIMLA: With a view to providing a facility to the pharma industry for testing their products within the state, an ultra modern laboratory of the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) will be set up at Baddi in Solan district. An MoU was signed on Wednesday between   government and NIPER in Mohali for this composite pharma  , which would be set up at a cost Rs 12 crore.

 The MoU was signed by director, industries,   on behalf of the Himachal Pradesh government and Dr U S N Murthi on behalf of NIPER. The laboratory would be jointly managed by the state government, NIPER and HMDA, while the technical assistance would be provided by NIPER. All modern facilities would be provided in the lab for testing of pharma products and the state government would bear the entire cost of the project.
 
 Officials said that with the setting up of this laboratory at Baddi, the pharma industry in the state would be immensely benefited, as now entrepreneurs have to go outside the state for testing of different pharma products.
 
 Industries minister   had raised the issue with Union chemicals and fertilizer minister Anant Kumar during last year to set up this laboratory at Baddi. Additional director industries Tilak Ram Sharma said that more than 70 per cent medicines were being manufactured at Baddi and setting up of this laboratory would benefit the entire pharma industry. He said that the state government would soon develop a bulk drug park at Baddi.
