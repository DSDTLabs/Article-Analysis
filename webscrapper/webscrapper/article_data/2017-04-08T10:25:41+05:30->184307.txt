Chennai: In a rare show of aggression,   Commercial Vehicles (DICV’s) CEO tore into a section of truck makers who sought to negate the pollution control measures by trying to interpret laws in their favour. A large section of truck makers sought legal clarifications on the grounds that April 1, 2017 was the cutoff date for manufacture of BS-IV vehicles and not sale date. BS-IV norms spew less pollution from the tail pipes of trucks compared to BS-III. In the run up to the legal verdict, manufacturers piled up inventory of trucks. Supreme Court ordered that from April 1, 2017 no sale of BS-III vehicles would be permitted, thereby forcing manufacturers to dump huge discounts in the market to offload their inventories before the cut-off date.

 “Building of 90,000 vehicle stock doesn’t happen by accident, but by intention,” said  , MD & CEO of DICV. DICV is the wholly owned subsidiary of   Benz, the world’s largest truck maker. He said that BS-IV technology, adopted by DICV will improve fuel efficiency significantly and maintenance cost for the fleet owner would drop 15%. The company unveiled its new range of BS-IV compliant trucks on Friday, without effecting a price increase now. However, the company had increased prices last month. “To cope with current global raw material cost developments, DICV slightly raised vehicle prices in March. At the same time, a significant portion of material cost increases was not passed on to customers, but absorbed by DICV through efficiency improvements,” he had told TOI two days ago.
 
 DICV, he said, has a BS-III inventory of 200 vehicles.
 
 With the new emission norms kicking in, all manufacturers would have now increase price to match the cost of technology. Once this happens, the price differential between DICV (which was costlier) and others would narrow thereby unleashing a new war on commercial vehicles space. “Now there is no price disadvantage for us, but only tech advantage.
