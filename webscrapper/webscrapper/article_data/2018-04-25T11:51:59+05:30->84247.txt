CHENNAI: To help improve areas of concern in the academic functioning of universities in the state, the   higher education council on Tuesday signed an MoU with, Indian Centre for Academic Rankings and Excellence (iCARE). 

 The private firm will work for free and will also analyse different departments to identify its weaknesses and address them across 13 universities in the state. This would also automatically help improve the overall rankings in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), said officials. 
 
 Higher education secretary   said institutions of Tamil Nadu were faring well in the NIRF rankings. Seven universities including  ,  ,  , Madhurai Kamraj University, Bharathidasan and Periyar universities are among the top 100 institutions. With this partnership, the government hopes that the analysis undertaken by iCARE would help propel all its universities to higher positions on the ranking list.
 
 "There are five broad parameters and 18 sub-parameters based on which performance of universities are measured. There will be a department wise analysis carried out by the firm. Each university's authorities may be measuring the performance of the institution through his or her understanding. A more data based analys will help identify strengths and weaknesses and further enhance their academic performance," said Paliwal.
