Nagpur: By settling 3,42,538 forest rights titles of the 3,68,351 received, the forest department has claimed that Maharashtra is one of the leading states in the country to implement Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006.

 Since the implementation of the Act, 8,549 cases have been decided in individual category and 3,33,989 in community forest rights (CFRs) category have been decided. The total forest area involved in settling these titles comes to 10,668 sqkm, which is equal to 17 Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserves (TATR). The TATR covers 625 sqkm.
 
 The forest department was reacting to Felix Padel, anthropologist and descendant of great biologist Charles Darwin, who during his city visit on Wednesday alleged that tribals in India are suffering because FRA was not being implemented in right spirit. Padel was in the city to attend the 11th Adivasi Adhikar Ghoshna Diwas function.
 
 The FRA, also known as Scheduled Tribes & Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, was enacted from December 31, 2007 and rules were framed from January 1, 2008. These rules were amended in 2012.
 
 The tribal development department is the nodal agency for the Act. Implementation of the Act is being done by forest rights committees at village, tehsil, and district level. Forest officials are members of the committee at tehsil and district level.
 
 Forest officials said Padelâ€™s contention is unfounded as far as Maharashtra is concerned. The report (June 2017) about the implementation of the FRA states that of the total 11,402 cases received, 8,549 (75%) have been settled in individual category. These include 5,784 cases of tribals and 2,765 of other traditional forest dwellers (OTFD). The forest area involved in individual titles is 23,75,439.64 acres (9,617sqkm).
 
 Similarly, they said under community forest rights, of the total 3,56,949 cases received, the government has settled 3,39,898 (95.22%) cases. These includes 2,36,849 cases of tribals and 1,03,004 cases of OTFDs. While settling these titles, 2,59,579.57 acres (1,051 sqkm) forest area is involved.
 
 If forest area of both individual titles 9,617 sqkm and CFR titles 1,051 sqkm is added, it comes to mind-boggling 17 TATRs. The total area diverted for FRA is even more than the total area under sanctuaries and national parks (8,500 sqkm) in the state. 
 
 Padel said tribals are the sufferers in the process as they are getting displaced in large numbers. However, considering the settlements of rights under FRA in Maharashtra, forest officials say Padel claims are false.
