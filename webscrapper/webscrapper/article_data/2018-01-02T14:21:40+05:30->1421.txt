HYDERABAD:   court located in  , which has hundreads of visitors daily, has no washrooms and drinking water facilities.

 Srinivas Verma General Secretary of   (Hyderabad) contacted TOI to air his grievance. “I visit the court frequently and there is no washroom neither for men or women, I request the authorities to build the washrooms keeping in mind the heavy foot fall,” said Srinivas.
 
 Another visitor at the court aired similar concern saying there are no public washrooms near the court. “If we want to use the washroom we should travel approximately three kilometres and reach Medchal. There is only one eatery near the court, but I backed out as I was shy to ask him about the washroom facility. It is very difficult especially for women who attend the court,” said a   who came to the court along with his grandmother.
 
 There are washrooms only for the judges and the staff at the court. All the cases registered with Jawahar Nagar Police Station, Alwal Police Station and Shamirpet Police station are heard at the Athvelly court. The decade old court was built after demolishing the Gram Panchayat building, since then, the people visiting the court suffer due to lack of basic amenities. Another issue haunting the people attending the court is lack of drinking water.
 
 “I can’t even see one water dispenser in the court adding to that there hardly any establishment selling water near the court,” said women at the court.
