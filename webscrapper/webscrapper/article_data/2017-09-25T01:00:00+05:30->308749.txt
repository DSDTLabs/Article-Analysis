Actor-comedian Kiku   seems to have a strange connection with a certain babaji, something that came to light while he was shooting for director Jaideep Kr Chopra’s ' ', in which he plays a godman’s son. The film also stars Divyenndu Sharma, Harshad Chopda, Priya Banerjee, Rahul Roy, Narendra Jha, Tom Alter, Supriya Karnik and Mir Sarwar.

 Kiku seems to share a karmic connection with babajis. If one recalls, the actor was arrested and sent to jail for a few hours for impersonating   while promoting the film at an event in January 2016. Jaideep says, “We were shooting a sequence at a police station.   wanted to understand how it feels to spend a night in prison. Strangely, the very next day, he was arrested.” 
 
 It seems that spelling out your fears can bring them to life. “Later, while shooting at a petrol pump, we realised that it was named after Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. It was a cringe-worthy moment for Kiku. Strangely, our film will release now, after he has been arrested,” the director adds.
