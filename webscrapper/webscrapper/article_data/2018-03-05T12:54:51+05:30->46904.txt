HYDERABAD: Motorists across the city complain about how unscientific placement of billboards often distract them at traffic signals. 

 "Hoardings are a distraction. Newly-erected advertisement billboards immediately catch one's attention. This can result in accidents," said  , a techie, pointing towards hoardings erected near  . "No new billboards should be permitted in the city," he said.
 
 Some of the hoardings that have been specifically mentioned by commuters are those at Khairatabad, Gachbowli , Hi-Tec, Kondapur, Kukatpally and Miyapur. 
 
 Several commuters also said that unipoles and hoardings are an eyesore as they spoil the landscape of the city. In   south zone, which covers Old City and Rajendranagar circle, flexies have been seen on monuments as well. 
 
 "A billboard has been erected near Machli Kaman near Charminar. Fortunately, flexies at Mozamjahi Market have been removed," said a senior citizen. In Ameerpet, as well as in Dilshukgnagar area, some structures are completely covered with a combination of hoardings and posters.
 
 "Whenever there is heavy wind, billboards become very dangerous. We cannot take our eyes away from them because we fear they will fall on us," said  , a homemaker. Commuters say the GHMC should coordinate with   and remove hoardings that are not structurally strong.
 
 For its part, GHMC has taken action in some cases. A ruling party corporator was penalised for erecting flexies to welcome IT minister KTR.
