PUNE: A 30-year-old practitioner of Ayurvedic medicine from Coimbatore has been arrested for allegedly outraging the modesty of a 26-year-old woman.

  is accused of touching the patient inappropriately during a medical camp that was organised at a mall in   on Sunday afternoon. The victim had approached him seeking a cure for polycystic ovarian syndrome, a hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries. She attended the camp after spotting an advertisement for it on a social networking website. 
 
 According to the FIR registered with   police station, the victim arrived at the medical camp on April 8 (Sunday) and had to wait at least two hours for her turn. 
 
 Police officials said the accused examined nearly 70 other women at the camp — charging as much as Rs 7,000 per patient. “He then offered them all some sort of cure,” said senior inspector Anil  , from the Mundhwa police station.
 
 In the FIR, it’s alleged that Guruswami proceeded to touch the victim’s private parts using treatment as a pretext. Police said the accused and two accomplices had managed to flee the crime scene before being detained. “But we nabbed Guruswami before he could flee,” Patrudkar said.
 
 Guruswami was produced before a city court, which remanded him in magisterial custody. Police also said Guruswami had arranged a similar camp last year, at the very same mall. “We are now investigating if he has been involved in more such cases,” Patrudkar said.
