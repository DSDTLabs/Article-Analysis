GURUGRAM: To tackle   in the city, the district authorities have planned to set up   (QRT) which will reach chokepoints and help   police in clearing a jam. 

 This decision was taken following a meeting of the road safety committee held to come up with measures to clear roads of  . 
 
 The traffic police receives around 20 to 25 calls reporting on   across the city on a regular basis. 
 
 However, the traffic department claims that mostly the calls are related to heavy traffic on the roads and sometimes owing to longer snarls at traffic signals. Therefore, the traffic department has decided to define a traffic jam as a period when a vehicle does not move forward for minutes. They plan to differentiate it from snarls when there is heavy traffic on road due to slow movement of traffic. 
 
 At present, traffic cops take a lot of time to reach the chokepoint as they travel in gypsies and often need to walk some distance to reach the spot, but the QRTs will be two bike-borne traffic cops who in comparison would reach earlier. When enforcement will reach faster, the problem too will be resolved faster, believes the authorities. 
 
 “These teams will be active between 7am to 11am and 6pm to 10pm,” said joint commissioner of police Sibash Kabiraj.
