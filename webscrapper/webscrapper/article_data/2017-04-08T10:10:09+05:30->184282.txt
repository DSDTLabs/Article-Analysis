PANAJI: Human rights activist and lawyer  , passed away in the civil and criminal court, at  , on Friday. He was 59.

 His sudden demise came as a shock to many, as Sonak was known to support several struggles and shoulder responsibilities that others didn’t willingly take up. 
 
 From taking up the cause of transgenders and disabled people, to rushing to the aid of the Vanarmare tribe when hardly anyone else stood in its defence, Sonak is remembered as a man who made the troubles of the less privileged his own. 
 
 His deep concern for people has manifested itself even in his death, as his family has donated his corneas to the Rotary eye bank, in keeping with his wishes. 
 
 In his youth, Sonakwho was the president of the All Goa Students’ Uniontook on the might of the powerful All Goa Bus Owners Association in the agitation for a 50% concession on bus fares for students, ultimately prevailing over the Sashikala Kakodkar-led government. The bus fare concession went on to give youth with insufficient financial means, a passport to education. 
 
 “He was the hero of the agitation,” recalls   writer and long-time friend, Dilip Borkar.
 
 A number of Sonak’s contemporaries from the students union and rival groups gathered at the Goa Medical College and Hospital on Friday no sooner had word about his death spread.
 
 Sonak leaves behind his wife, Harshada Kerkar.
 
 His brother-in-law and famous artist, Subodh Kerkar, says he took up issues not for the sake of publicity but because he was genuinely interested in equity. “He was also very well read and was an excellent Marathi writer,” Kerkar said.
 
  can pay their last respects to the doughty fighter on Saturday morning. The funeral procession will leave Sonak’s residence, ‘Ashwini’, at St Inez, at 10am.
