MUNGER: A major   tragedy was averted on Tuesday due to quick action of the district administration and the police.

 Harinmar SHO Mukesh Kumar said, “Altogether 108 persons including 40 females, 65 males and three children boarded a country boat at Maniarchak ghat, 15 km from the district headquarters, around 6pm to reach their native village Harinmar. 
 
 As soon as the boat reached midstream on the confluence of Ganga and Gandak, it got stucked up in a net cast by fishermen in the river. The fishermen had left the bank of the river after casting their net.
 
 The boatman tried his level best to sail away but all his efforts proved futile. The passengers on the board too became panicky as it was already dark. One of them called the sadar SDO Kundan Kumar from his mobile and urged him to avert the tragedy by arranging a few boats.
 
 The SDO said it was 7.30pm when he received the message. He at once called Harinmar SHO directing him to arrange a few boats and send them to the spot where the boat was stuck. The SHO immediately sent some policemen to the fishermen’s house and called them with their boats. Three boats were finally arranged which reached there at about 11 pm. “It took about two hours to evacuate the passengers of the ill-fated boat. We heaved a sigh of relief when all the passengers reached their homes safely by 1 am on Wednesday,” the SHO said.
