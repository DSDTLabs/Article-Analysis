NOIDA: The   and Delhi governments will form a joint coordination committee to work out the overhaul of the  , the forest officer of   said on Thursday. 

 "As the   Bird Sanctuary covers two states, permission for its overhaul will have to be taken from both governments. A coordination committee will have to be formed with representatives from the departments of forest, civil, irrigation and others to approve the plan. The funding is expected from the ministry of forests and environment," said HV Girish, the district forest officer.
 
 Girish said a temporary estimate of Rs 25 crore had been mentioned in a draft report. Now that the Centre is involved in the project, Girish said the detailed project report would be vetted by it.
 
 "The Uttar Pradesh government will soon appoint an agency to draw a DPR or a blue print for this overhaul. The plan would then be approved by the ministry for funding. We hope this process will not take more than two months. Work on the ground would start soon after all the necessary approvals have been granted for the project," Girish said.
 
 Union minister   had earlier this month announced a complete revamp of the bird park by the end of the year. "The Okhla Bird Sanctuary hosts a rich diversity of birds from India and abroad. We will fully involve ourselves in the upgrade of the park," he had said.
 
 As part of the overhaul, new gates, cameras, washrooms, observatories and a library of books on birds would be set up in the park.
 
 More than 300 species of birds are reported to have been spotted at the park. Of these, 50% are migratory birds, 36% resident birds and the remaining are vagrant sightings or of unknown category.
