BENGALURU: The   (EC), which constituted a panel to investigate the leak of Karnataka’s poll schedule online, has questioned Congress’ social media in-charge for the state.

 Congressman Srivatsa YB had tweeted the state’s poll schedule — with a wrong counting date — on Tuesday, minutes before chief election commissioner OP Rawat announced it at a press conference. BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya too had tweeted the state election schedule at the same time as Srivatsa, with the same mistake in the counting date.
 
 According to the terms of reference issued by the poll panel, an inquiry will be launched against Srivatsa regarding the source of information in his tweets.
 
 Malviya has already written to the EC that a news channel was his source of information. When contacted, the Congressman said the EC had already contacted him on Wednesday.
 
 ‘Tweet based on TV report’
 
 Srivatsa told the commission that he had tweeted the poll dates based on a newsbreak on a TV channel.
 
 The six-member inquiry panel, headed by senior deputy election commissioner Umesh Sinha, will also contact “the Kannada news channel allegedly owned by a @BJP4india MP tweeted by Poulomi Saha regarding the source of information...”
 
 The EC also said the committee will look into lapses, if any, and recommend how to prevent any chances of such eventuality in the future. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report.
