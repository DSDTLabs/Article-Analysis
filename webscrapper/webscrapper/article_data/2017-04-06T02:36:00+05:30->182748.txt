MUMBAI: The   government plans to develop   transport between Thane, Kalyan, Vasai, Mira-Bhayander at the cost of Rs 280 crore with an aim to ease congestion in the Mumbai metropolitan region . 

 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday announced a plan to promote waterways in the House. “If all goes according to plan, then water   will be a reality in the next two or three years. It has the potential to reduce road traffic and pollution,” Fadnavis said, while replying to a motion moved by Pratap Sarnaik (Sena). 
 
 The decision to develop Thane creek as a waterway was taken in a joint meeting held in August 2016 between the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), Maharashtra Maritime Board and the Thane Municipal Corporation. The 145km Thane creek has been designated as national waterway (NW) 53. There are 14 national waterways in Maharashtra (seven each along creeks and inland rivers). Fadnavis said the government was also planning roll-on roll-off (RORO) service (transportation of vehicles by boats) from Bhayandar to Vasai and had received a Rs 5 crore grant from the Centre under the Sagarmala project. “We are awaiting environmental clearance,” he said.
