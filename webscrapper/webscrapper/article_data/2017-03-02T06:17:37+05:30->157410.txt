BENGALURU: The Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (KSIIDC) has proposed to adopt the highly polluted   and spruce it up. 

 The corporation plans to revive the waterbody with financial assistance from the UK government.
 
 "The KSIIDC is ready to adopt Bellandur Lake and we have a well-planned scheme to revive it. Money is not an issue as the UK government has, in principle, agreed to finance the project," said KSIIDC chairman   at a press conference on Wednesday. 
 
 Dhananjaya said the UK government had come forward to lend 1 billion pounds under its UK Government Project Finance Proposal scheme. The KSIIDC officials would discuss the proposal with chief minister Siddaramaiah and the process to take up the works would start soon after the government gives its nod, said Dhananjaya.
 
 Bellandur Lake, the city's biggest waterbody, is said to be the most polluted. The water is contaminated with industrial effluents and other pollutants, with the lake frothing time and again. On February 16, the lake caught fire, which experts said was possibly because of a lethal mix of industrial effluents and domestic waste.

On Tuesday, the Lokayukta registered a suo motu case and issued notices to the BBMP, BDA and the   and sought reports from them.
