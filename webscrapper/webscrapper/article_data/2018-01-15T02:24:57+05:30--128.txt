MUMBAI: For a large number of Mumbai astronomers and space enthusiasts it was a different type of experience on Saturday evening.

 The venue for a two-hour meeting relating to space and astronomy was not a conventional auditorium, but appropriately for a Saturday evening at a swanky Lower Parel pub. Two organisations, Space Geeks Mumbai and   had invited American planetary scientist Henry  , who was involved with Nasa’s New Horizons mission to Pluto.
 
 Chintamani Pai, one of the founders of Space Geeks Mumbai, told TOI: “We decided on a pub venue to provide a new type of experience to space addicts.” Throop, whose presentation focussed on the theme ‘Are we alone in the universe’, said “Let us go to Saturn’s moon, Enceladus, and Jupiter’s moon, Europa, and find some life.” Throop said that the hunt for life is closely associated with the search for liquid water. “Three best places to search for liquid water are Mars, Enceladus and Europa, which probably has a warm ocean underneath an icy shell raising a question whether it could be a perfect place to find life,” he added. Throop said the Lonar crater in Maharashtra was the best site on Earth to study conditions on Mars.
