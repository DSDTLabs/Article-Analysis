With hours to go for the Union Budget to be announced of which the railways is also a part now, finance minister Arun Jaitley is expected to give major infrastructure boost to Vidarbha region.

 “The budget is expected to give approval to semi-high speed corridor between Howrah-Mumbai wherein trains will run at 160 kmph. Work on semi-high speed tracks is already going on between Nagpur-Bilaspur and Nagpur-Secunderabad,” said SECR DRM Amit Kumar Agarwal. 
 
 The Economic Survey released on January 29 also hinted at ‘transformative’ steps in the railway sector. “If there is no announcement regarding any new trains, Nagpur Central Railway expects to get approval to around Rs300 crore boost for railway safety and traffic upgradation projects. The works have already been approved at headquarters-level,” said DRM Brijesh Kumar Gupta.
 
 Agarwal expected big allocation for conversion of Itwari-Nagbhid narrow gauge line, especially after Maharashtra government agreeing to share 50% of the Rs738 crore project cost. Till now, the project was held-up. “We expect good allocation for passenger amenities, signalling, line conversion and safety issues like track maintenance and OHE equipment. We have plans to procure 100 tower wagons and allocation is expected. Wadsa-Gadchiroli line is set to get a major boost. There were surveys done for other lines too, I hope these projects are approved,” he said.
 
 “Railway minister Piyush Goel has already said funds will not be a constraint for ongoing projects like third and fourth line. We even expect to commission one of the third line section in 2018-19,” said Gupta. 
 
 “Considering the central location, it is high time Nagpur is declared a full-fledged railway zone. Union minister Nitin Gadkari needs to pitch in to convert Godhni station into a terminus as Nagpur has become congested,” said Pravin Datke, former mayor.
 
 Consumer rights activist Avinash Prabhune expected Jaitley to make some big announcements for safe travel. “From 2017 till date, there have been over 50 train accidents in which over 55 persons have died and over 190 injured. More funds are needed for train warning systems in place,” said Prabhune.
 
 Rail Yatri Sangh chief Brijbhushan Shukla did not expect much. “This being last full budget before the general elections next year, fare hike is also not expected. We hope cleanliness and safety aboard trains improves,” Shukla said.
 
 Ex-president of Butibori Manufacturers Association Pradeep Khandelwal wanted railways to replace the obsolete rolling stock.
 
 Bharatiya Yatri Kendra’s Basant Kumar Shukla, who demanded trains to Rai Bareli, Lucknow and DEMU-MEMU trains for short distance travel, said not much is expected.
 
 “More focus is expected on capacity upgrades on trunk lines with heavy freight and passenger traffic. Tripling or quadrupling of many of these lines are already announced and allocation of funds for upgrades of speed in identified sections may now become visible,” said railway analyst Alok Patel.
