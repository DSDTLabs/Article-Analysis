 The two actors were together for more than a decade and have been married for two years before Jolie filed for divorce last September. They have six children; Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Knox and  . They have a voluntary temporary custody agreement in place that allows Pitt supervised visitation of the children.
 
 Last month, a judge denied a request by Pitt to seal documents in his custody battle with Jolie. Pitt said in court documents that he was "extremely concerned" that if the records were not sealed, his children's privacy rights would be irreparably harmed. Jolie's counsel fired back that Pitt's request was merely a "thinly-veiled attempt to shield himself, rather than the minor children, from the public view."
