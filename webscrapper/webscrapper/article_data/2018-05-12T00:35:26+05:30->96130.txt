 Trichy: Only when people resort to surrounding central government offices and stage demonstration, it would get a good reach and make the Centre think about setting up Cauvery Management Board, said MDMK leader Vaiko here on Friday.
 
 He was speaking at a protest organised by Tamizhar Veera Vilayattu Meetpu Kazhagam at the Cauvery river bed in Kallanai Road to condemn the Centre over not forming CMB. Vaiko and Tamil Maanila Congress leader G K Vasan launched the protest, which was observed by the participants abstaining from drinking water through the duration of the demonstration.
 
 Vaiko said that protest does not mean violence and that nothing can be gained by conducting rail/ road roko or by shutting down shops. “Only day-to-day life would get affected by that,” he said. Instead, he asked people resort to surrounding central government offices and stage demonstration, to get a good reach. He also claimed that the Supreme Court itself had the power to setup Cauvery Management Board legally on its own.
 
 On the other hand, Vasan urged people to attain the right of getting Cauvery water by creating a revolution. “Protecting agriculture is of utmost importance. But this is not only a farmer’s issue. It’s an issue for the entire state,” he said. “Over the past 50 years, we have lost the right over Cauvery water step by step,” stated Vasan and added that Cauvery water serves as main source of irrigation for 25 lakh acres of agricultural land.
 
 Indian Union Muslim League national president K M Kader Mohideen was also present at the event.
