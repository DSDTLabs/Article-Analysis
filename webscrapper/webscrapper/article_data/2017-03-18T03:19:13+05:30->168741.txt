NAVI MUMBAI: Hawkers in   recently staged a demonstration at   to demand for legitimate  . 

 “There are close to 700 hawkers in various sectors of Kharghar, but the authorities have still not allotted us proper zones, leading to business losses due to demolition drives,” said one of the protesters.
 
 A representative of the hawker’s group, Monu Pal Kute, said, “We had taken out a peaceful morcha earlier this week in order to urge the Panvel City Municipal Corporation to chalk out hawking zones. The   elections will be held next month and we want the civic body to implement it prior to the polls, as it is a constitutional right of the hawkers to do their business legally.”
 
 In the last 30 days, nearly 10 drives were conducted by PCMC officials in order to evict the Kharghar hawkers, Kute added.
 
 “There are over 20 colleges and many corporate offices who want to have fast-food snacks. So, we have every reason to ask for a proper hawking zone,” another protester said. 
 
 Civic officials said they were trying to chart out hawking zones sooner in order to resolve the issue.
