Hyderabad: From 33 million units per day in May 2014, the peak power supply demand in Greater Hyderabad is expected to shoot up to 60 million units per day by May 2017. 

 While the other districts in Telangana recorded an increase of 8%, Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Ranga Reddy districts reported an 18% increase. This is thanks to the 24x7 power supply to the domestic sector in the last two-and-half years . 
 
 Under the GHMC limits, over 4 lakh new power connections have been granted by the Southern Power Discom. Officials said the peak  , which was about 1,800 MW in Greater Hyderabad before the formation of separate Telangana in June 2014, has now crossed 2,400 MW. It is expected to touch 3,000 MW by May 2017.
 
 Another reason for the hike in demand is the rise in cultivable land. With the success of Mission Kakatiya, tanks in almost all districts have come back to life and are aiding irrigation. Also, a good monsoon last year resulted in copious inflows into rivers, canals and tanks. Enthused by this, more than 15 lakh farmers took up Rabi cultivation on more than 20 lakh hectares in the state.
 
 Another factor is the revival of sick units in industrial estates. With the assurance of uninterrupted power, many small and medium industrial units returned to activity. Balanagar, Jeedimetla and Nacharam industrial clusters in the city are buzzing with activity.
