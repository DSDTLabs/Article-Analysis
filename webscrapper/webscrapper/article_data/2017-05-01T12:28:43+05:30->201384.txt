Indians living abroad and those living far away from their families and are unable to rush back to attend the   of their loved ones, hope is just a mouse click away.   is about to launch a  , which will allow family to watch the   of their loved ones through internet. The facility will be launched from May and will be free.

 Previously, Siddhpur Muktidham had started a similar service for the kin of the deceased. The crematorium in Sector 30, which is managed by the Junior Citizen Council (JUCICA) for the past five years, will have six high-tech cameras near the cremation area. The crematorium will use hi-speed internet connection to broadcast the funeral. According to JUCICA members, the facility will be available on demand and the family members will be given a password through which they can access the live feed.
 
 No charge for facility
 
 Binesh Vasavda, president of JUCICA, said, “In the past, there have been instances where relatives have not been able to attend the last rites who has passed away suddenly. They are unable to bid a final farewell. It is painful for the grieving members to be unable to do so. So, we thought of providing a webcast of the event.” Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) has also given its nod to the project. Vasavda told Mirror that the crematorium sees 8 to 10 cremations on a daily basis.
 
 “The facility will be free. But the deceased’s kin will have to register a few hours before the last rites have to be performed so that we can make arrangement. We will provide a log in ID and password through which they will be able to access the feed. We will also provide them a CD of the ritual,” he said. According to JUCICA, the recordings will be kept for a few days on the crematorium services. They will also record the last rites of the unclaimed dead bodies found by the cops. The crematorium will spend Rs 2 lakh to install the cameras and highspeed internet. It will also purchase data storage disks to store the recordings.
