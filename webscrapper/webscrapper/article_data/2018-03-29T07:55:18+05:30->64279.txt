MOHALI: Lt Colonel B S Sandhu (retd), the owner of   Golf and Country Club Resort and World Wide Immigration Consultancy Services (WWICS), would be quizzed in connection with the finding of the body of a   employee, said   senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal on Tuesday.

 Three employees of Sandhu were arrested on March 26 for allegedly disposing of the decomposed body of CTU employee Abhishek Guleria, 28, in a forest area near Basol village on the Pinjore-Baddi road.
 
 The three are Gurvinder Singh Bains, a resident of Noorpur Bedi, near Anandpur Sahib, Balwinder Singh, a resident of Mohali, and Tarsem Chand, a resident of Nada village in  . According to the FIR, the three were employed as supervisors at the resort in Karoran village. They have been booked for murder and kidnapping. A court on Tuesday sent them in two-day police custody.
 
 The SSP said the police have already issued summons to Sandhu.
 
 Chahal said, “We have established the alleged involvement of Sandhu in the crime based on the statements of the three accused. Two vehicles registered at the resort in which the body was transported to be dumped in the forest have been impounded. The maggot-infested body was fished out of a pond on the premises of the resort by the accused, after which the three allegedly dumped it in the forest.
 
 Police recovered the body on March 26. Sandhu will be soon questioned.”
 
 Chahal said Sandhu’s name cropped up after establishing the facts and evidence against him and police had earlier also issued summons to him
 
 under Section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to record his statement.
 
 Despite repeated phone calls and SMSs, Sandhu
 
 did not respond to give his comments.
