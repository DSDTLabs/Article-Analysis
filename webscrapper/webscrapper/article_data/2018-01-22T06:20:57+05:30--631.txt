CHENNAI: A 34-year-old   died in mysterious circumstances overnight on Friday in a hotel in St Thomas Mount, the city police said on Sunday.

 Investigators said a police team at noon on Saturday entered the room that Swathi had checked into the NK Courtyard Hotel, Sripuram Colony, on Friday night and found the software professional slumped over and lifeless.
 
 “There were no external injuries and she did not leave a suicide note,” an investigating officer said. “We noticed that blood had been oozing from her nose. There were two empty rum bottles in the room, one on a table and the other in a dustbin.”
 
 Evidence indicated that Swathi may have died of   after excessive consumption of  , he said, adding that investigators were awaiting an autopsy report from Chromepet Government Hospital.
 
 “There was no sign of assault,” the officer said. “But we will not be able to make a conclusive statement on the cause of death before receiving the report.”
 
 Swathi had been in the US for some time before returning to Chennai two years ago, he said. She lived with her husband Anand, 35, and their children, aged four and one, in Nagalkeni, Chromepet, and worked with a company in Manapakkam.
 
 Anand told investigators that Swathi consumed liquor but did not have any history of illness. After Anand started to admonish his wife over her habit, she would book a room in a hotel once in a while and   alone, the officer said. 
 
 “Swathi called Anand and her mother around 10.30pm on Friday, saying she had to stay back at office for some extra work and would return in the morning,” he said.
 
 A police team used a spare key to open the room after employees of the hotel, barely 500m from the flyover at Kathipara, tried repeatedly to call Swathi but failed to elicit any response. “We checked footage from security cameras in the hotel,” the officer said. “There was no suspicious activity near the room Swathi had taken.”
