Trichy: As the authorities are preparing to acquire land for the terminal expansion of the Trichy International Airport, dissatisfied land owners and residents staged a protest, covering their mouths with black cloth at Pattathammal Street here on Tuesday.

 The agitators refused to accept apartments from housing board quarters and demanded that a site should be allocated for them to build separate houses. They have prepared a list of demands to be addressed by the revenue officials before being asked to move out of their lands adjacent to the Airport.
 
 The protestors urged the district administration to allot housing site each measuring over 1200 square on a land owned by a private party falling on ward number 37. They demanded a compensation amount for their soon-to be moving houses valued at the current market rate, adding in the present prices on construction materials like sand, blue metals and cement.
 
 Further, they urged to Airport Authority of India, Trichy, to give job to every member of their families at the airport on a regular basis.
