HYDERABAD:   drivers are all set to get behind the wheel of school and junior college buses, particularly those ferrying girl students in  .

 The Union government will fund the training of women drivers and helpers.Union minister of women and child development Maneka Gandhi has assured the Telangana government that the Union government lead by Narendra Modi will release funds required for training women drivers.
 
 Telangana women development and child welfare director Viziendira Boyi confirmed to TOI that they were writing to the managements of all the private schools to employ female drivers and helpers on their buses, vans and other vehicles transporting school children.
 
 This move is aimed at ensuring safety of children, particularly girls, in the backdrop of recent incidents of violence and sexual abuse including the   murder in Gurgaon.
 
 Union minister Maneka Gandhi during her recent visit to Hyderabad, asked the officials of women and child welfare in Telangana to seriously pursue the project.
 
 Officials are also planning to take the help of FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and In dustry) Ladies Organisation, which has been imparting driving training to women. The organisation has already completed training of several batches of women drivers.
 
 Boyi said the plan is to first replace male helpers with female helpers on the school buses and go for women drivers in the next phase. “We are convening a meeting with school education and transport department officials too to ensure employment of women drivers and helpers,“ Boyi said.
 
 The education department will take up the issue with the managements of private schools and the transport department would chip in with its services in association with training schools, including   to train women drivers.
 
 “Already some school buses have women helpers. My child's school bus has a women helper,“ the director further said.
