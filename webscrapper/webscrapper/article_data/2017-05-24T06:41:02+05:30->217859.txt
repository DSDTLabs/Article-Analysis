PUNE: The ambitious Rs 990-crore project for abatement of pollution in the   has been held up due to a delay in appointing a principal consultant, shared officials of the   (PMC). Despite the delay, the civic body has already received funds to the tune of Rs26 crore over the past six months. 

 For now, PMC is using the money to lay sewerage lines and build community toilets. 
 
 The project was announced by then minister of environment, forest and climate change in January 2016, after the union government agreed to a soft loan from   (JICA). However, ever since, progress has been slow.
 
 According to PMC’s superintendent engineer of the drainage department Jagdish Khanore, “Under the union ministry, the National River Conservation Plan ( ) authorities are to appoint a principal consultant for the project. However, this appointment has been pending since the past six months. Only after the consultant is appointed can we begin tendering contracts.”
 
 The official stated that the municipal commissioner had written to the NRCP, New Delhi citing that while the PMC had received some funds, utilising the same was not possible until a consultant was appointed. 
 
 “Following this, the NRCP responded granting us sanction to proceed with work for land acquisition, laying sewerage lines, and building public toilets from the funds we have already received,” Khanore said.
