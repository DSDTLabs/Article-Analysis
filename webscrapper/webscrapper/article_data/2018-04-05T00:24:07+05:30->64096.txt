Vadodara: Several bags of rice were gutted after a fire broke out at one of the sheds at Central Warehousing Corporation’s (CWC) warehouse at Navayard on Wednesday morning.

 The fire in A4 shed of the warehouse was brought under control within 30 minutes by the fire department, but it raised suspicion over how it was ignited. Fire department sources said that short circuit cannot be the reason behind the fire as all wires are concealed.
 
 “After the fire was brought under control, during our investigations the workers told us that it is their daily schedule to open the windows and shutters of the shed for ventilation. During that moment a cigarette butt or a burning particle could have entered in the shed due to wind which may have ignited the fire,” said Om Jadeja, station officer, TP-13 fire station.
 
 Fire officials said that no officials of CWC were present on the spot when the incident took place, therefore how much rice stock was destroyed could not be known. But according to an estimate around 500 to 1,000 kilogram of rice was gutted either in fire or damaged during fire-fighting process, a fire official said.
 
 On Wednesday, only the A4 shed, out of the five sheds in the warehouse, had grain stock. According to sources, the stock, which was deposited in the warehouse last year, belonged to Food Corporation of India.
