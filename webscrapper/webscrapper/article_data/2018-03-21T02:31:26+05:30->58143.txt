NEW DELHI: With cash-starved   on the selling block, the government has released funds from National Small Savings Funds (NSSF) for retrofitting two brand new   777 planes that will be used by future Indian presidents and prime ministers for long haul flights. The two B 777-300 extended range (ER) planes were delivered to AI last month and will be sent to US for having ultra modern communication and security systems, apart from ultra comfortable interiors. 

 
 Once ready by 2020, they will phase out the over 25-year-old jumbo jets used by VVIPs currently. “Air India had proposed to seek a short term loan of $180 million (over Rs 1,100 crore) from   which was selected by way of tender process for the modification of two B-777 ER aircraft allocated for special extra section flights (SESF)   operations. However, this loan was not taken as the Government of India has released the required funds/amounts from National Small Savings Funds (NSSF) account for the payment towards both procurement and modification of these two B 777-300ER aircraft,” minister of state for civil aviation   told Parliament Tuesday, in reply to a query on whether AI had sought a loan of Rs 1,100 crore for modifying these two planes. 
 
 “These planes will be used for SESF of Government of India. The cost of cabin reconfiguration is now estimated $132 million for two B777-300ER aircraft. The original estimate was around $180 million,” Sinha said in his reply. The government is considering options over who will maintain and operate these two VVIP planes as AI is soon going to be privatised. At present, IAF operates and maintains a fleet of single aisle Boeing Business Jets for domestic and short international flights by top VVIPs. 
 
 The two twin aisle B-777s may go the same way by having experienced AI personnel, like pilots and engineers, on board. “As of now, the two B-777s are part of AI inventory,” a top official said.
