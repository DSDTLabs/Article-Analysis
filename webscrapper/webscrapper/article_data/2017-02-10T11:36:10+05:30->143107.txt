BIJNOR: Taking a dig at BJP and BSP at Bijnor’s Nehtaur rally, Congress’s UP in-charge,   said, “ BJP and BSP are two sides of a coin.   alliance is best option for those who want to stop these two parties from coming in power here.” Azad was trying to win the support of anti BJP voters including Muslim by making this statement.
 
  Projecting the reason for making alliance with SP, former chief minister of Kashmir, Azad said, “ Had we allied with SP ahead of last lok sabha poll, BJP could not have won the election and not formed the govt in centre. We have forged this alliance to stop saffron party from coming in power in Utter Pradesh. BSP and BJP will join hands after the polls.”
  
  Trying to get political mileage, out of demonetisation move, he lambasted the central govt and said, “Central government created problems for the public, snatching the breads from the hands of the poor. Business has come to a standstill and farmers could not sow the seeds. They have suffered too much. Modi’s govt has come as a haunting spirit not a good a government. BJP’s central govt did nothing for common men so far.”
  
 Claiming the SP-Congress alliance will form the government in UP, Azad said, “ Alliance will bring over 300 seats in   and give a good governance to the people and our govt will bring all round development.”
  
  A large number of people, most of them Muslim were present in the rally. SP-Congress alliance is trying to woo anti BJP voters especially Muslim. In last assembly polls, due to dalit Muslim alliance, BSP had won four seats out of all eight. In 2007, BSP had won all seats from Binor district as Bijnor has 43% Muslims and 24% dalit, of total voters. However, SP-Congress alliance also fielded five Muslim candidates.
