MUMBAI:  , prime accused in her daughter  's murder case, did not overdose on any medicine prescribed by the jail doctors, senior jail officials said on Thursday. 

 They added Benzodiazepine, a class of anti-depressants found in significant amounts in her urine sample, was not part of her routine medicines.   was rushed to   in a semi-conscious state on April 6 following a suspected drug overdose. A senior jail official who is conducting an inquiry into the episode is yet to complete probe. Jail sources said Indrani has sought some more time to give a detailed statement as she has not recovered fully yet. A source indicated she also wants to consult her lawyer.
 
 Jail authorities said they do not have any information about Indrani being given anything from outside, but inquiry is still on. "Analysis of   footage of the court premises has not revealed anything suspicious. No bag was given to her as reported earlier in the media," said a senior officer. It is yet to be established where Indrani got the medicines from and who delivered them to her. Jail police have so far recorded the statements of 30 people. -Mateen Hafeez
