BENGALURU: On Day 2 of his Bharat Yatra in Bengaluru, Nobel peace laureate   asked, “In a great country like India, how can you allow or accept a child getting killed in school?“ “Child abuse is spreading like an epidemic.Even the safest places for children are not as safe now. We have been fighting for so long against child abuse, but is the message being adopted by everyone? No. People think until it's their child, it doesn't matter. It's high time we connected with our children with compassion so that they share about their lives and things affecting them, instead of taking things into their hand,“ said the child rights crusader. He was addressing members of the Rotary Clubs of Cubbon Park, R T Nagar and Bangalore southeast at Rotary District 3190 ICGF on   on Sunday.The event was held at Samskruthi Brindavan Convention Centre, J P Nagar.
Satyarthi urged parents to pay attention to their children's behaviour and try to learn more about their life when they appear depressed, uncomfortable or are lost in thought. “Because, at times, they do not have any idea that what they are facing is actually abuse,“ he added.
 
 Satyarthi urged youngsters to stand up against child abuse and trafficking which is impacting families across the country and urged for “inner swacchta“ before thinking of Swachh Bharat.
 
 Said Ramaswami  , founder of Swami Vivekanand Youth Movement, Think before you waste a paise. People in rural areas don't have power and go without food.Think about inclusive development, not individual development.
 
 As part of the event, Asha Prasanna Kumar, district governor, Rotary District 3190, flagged off End Polio -a 20,000km cycle expedition. All Rotary members present on the occasion took a pledge to donate their eyes.
