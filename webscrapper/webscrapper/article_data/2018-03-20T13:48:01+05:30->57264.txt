BHOPAL: Over 900 residents of   village in Morena district have fallen ill after consuming contaminated water — and the numbers are only increasing.

 Remjapura lies in   tehsil situated in the ravines of Chambal. Sources say that due to water scarcity the groundwater in the villages has gone as deep as 800 feet in many places. The villagers are relying on wells and tube wells which are only giving out dirty water — causing sickness.
 
 “The water table in the village has depleted drastically. Tubewells are defunct. There are two deep wells which are open but are filthy. We have no other option but to drink water from the dirty well,” said  , a villager. The incident came to light when people in hundreds reached Sabalgarh government hospital for treatment on Sunday. 
 
 Scared, many villagers have also started to leave Remjapura with their bags and baggage. Denying reports of the scale of illness, district collector,   said, “As soon as we learnt about the illness, a team of officials and doctors was brought to the area urgently. Now, only 30 to 35 people are ill and the situation is under control. All three hand pumps in the village are function and the villagers are advised not to use contaminated well water.”
 
 The reports from Remjapura, however, paint a grim picture. “80 percent people have been taken ill,” said Dinanath, another villager. Residents say that the water crisis in the city started long back. In October last year, over 5,000 villagers had staged a dharna for more than a month at Sabalgarh tehsil headquarters. 
 
 The villagers, including sarpanchs of 12 panchayats, also urged the government to declare Sabalgarh as drought-hit. A panchayat member,   said, “In Rampur panchayat, a large number of villagers have migrated to other placesdue to water shortage.” The collector denied reports of migration due to shortage of water in Rampur.
