NAGPUR: A trickster tried to dupe a businessman of Rs84 lakh by attempting to buy Bitcoins using stolen cheques between January 30 and February 23.

 Sunil Bothra, 53, owns a cotton ginning factory. The trickster had gone to   branch of a nationalized bank and tried to transfer Rs70 lakh through RTGS from Bothra’s account. The bank officials smelled a rat and called Bothra, but the miscreant had fled before Bothra arrived.
 
 Later, the trickster went to another branch of the nationalized bank at   and transferred Rs14 lakh into a Tumkur account to buy Bitcoins. However, Bothra received a SMS when the money was debited from his account, and rushed to the bank to reverse the transfer, and put future transactions on hold.
 
 Some days later, Bothra again received a SMS alert that his net banking mobile number has been changed. He then approached   police station and registered a case of cheating.
 
 Cops have scrutinized   footage from both banks. In the second attempt, the trickster was wearing a scarf during the whole transaction. This showed negligence of bank officials, who allowed transaction of Rs14 lakh without seeing the man’s face.
