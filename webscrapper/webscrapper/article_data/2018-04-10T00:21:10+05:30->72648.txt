Pune: India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has partnered with Dimension Data to set up digital branches in the country. Labelled sbiINTOUCH, the digital branches of the bank make extensive use of customer data to cross sell products. So far, SBI has set up 60 such branches in the country. The aim of these branches is to use data analytics to enable instant loan approvals and give investment advice to customers, besides powering digital banking transactions.  “Now the bank spends 15-20% of its IT budget on technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence and data analytics…We have a team of 100 data analysts who are working on data, day in and day out,” Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, deputy managing director and CIO, SBI, said.  He said the spending pattern has changed over the last five years. “The bank spends about 7-8% of its operating expenses (opex) on technology – quite more than a lot of other Indian banks, but less compared to global banks that spend about 14-15% of their opex on technology,” Mahapatra said. This translates into an conservative Rs 3,000 crore per year based on the bank’s standalone opex of Rs 46,473 crore in FY17.  Mahapatra said the bank is working with service providers like Dimension Data to make platforms that are “interoperable.”  “SBI is orchestrating a platform economy. Going forward, we must be ready to play on platforms provided by other competitor banks and vice versa and so platform builders like dimension data have a very important role to play,” he said, adding that a lot of standalone wallets will see “sunset” sooner than expected.
