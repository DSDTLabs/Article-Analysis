AHMEDABAD: The low pass percentage in   science exams — the results of which were declared on Thursday — has raised questions about the policies of the   government. Over the past five years, the government’s policy on HSC science stream have changed several times. For example, the government decided to introduce the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in 2013. But three years later, even as the state’s scores were improving, the government heeded the advice of a Rajkot-based management college and made JEE optional. 

 The Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) was reintroduced. Officials pointed out that around 1,000 students were qualifying for JEE Advanced prior to 2012; in 2016, 12,000 qualified. This year however, only 6,000 have qualified. 
 
  
  When the semester system was introduced, the pass percentage was 67. After the introduction of the system in 2013, the percentage shot up to 80, and in 2014 it was 94. However, the government junked the semester system in 2017 and the pass percentage slid to 72 in 2018.
 
 Educationists believe that the government has carried out too many experiments at the expense of students.  , a former principal and educationist, said: “The government does not have a long-term policy. Its moves are half-hearted and with the slightest hue and cry, it changes policies.” Joshi said frequent changes in education policies are harming the interests of students. He said that the government should plan changes only after talking to educationists, teachers, students, and parents.
 
 “The system of a single examination places a huge burden on students,” said a former chairman of the Admission Committee for Professional Courses. “Earlier, in the semester system, students used to study for a specific period and scored good marksFurther, opting out of JEE was not required as the performance of students was improving every year.”
