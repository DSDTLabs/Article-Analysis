MUMBAI: After an activist complained against a south Mumbai-based plastic surgeon who posted a patient's picture on his   account, the   ( ) has asked the doctor to provide an explanation. 

 
 In its notice dated May 7, the MMC has forwarded the activist's complaint and asked him to give a detailed reply. MMC officials, however, made it clear that seeking an explanation is merely the first step. "MMC seeks explanation from doctors about every complaint it receives, but any further action, if at all, will be based on our ethics committee's review of the case," said MMC's Dr Jayesh Lele.
 
 The complaint was filed by   activist  , who said he came across the post while looking for a plastic surgeon. "I was shocked to see this doctor posing with another person who he claimed was his patient," he said. The patient's permission should have been sought and/or his eyes and face could have been blurred. "It should be put up on the hospital's website, and that too after taking the patient's due consent,"   added.
 
 When contacted, the doctor said he had posted the picture because the patient, a diabetic, had got cured despite sustaining 60% burns. He said patients with over 40% burns rarely manage well. "I put up the picture as a means to create awareness about burns treatment. I did so after seeking the patient's permission," added the doctor.
