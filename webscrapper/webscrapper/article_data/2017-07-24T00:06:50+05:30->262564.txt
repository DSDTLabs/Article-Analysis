NAVI MUMBAI: Most families spent Sunday performing   to herald the beginning of the auspicious month of   from Monday.

  Many light 108 earthen diyas as part of their   for goddess Lakshmi. 
 
 Nita Kulkarni, a Vashi resident, performed the deep puja along with her family members. 
 
  “According to our custom, we keep our front door open to welcome goddess Lakshmi and seek her blessings for health, wealth and prosperity. We believe that the light from the lamps will drive out all evils in the family,” Kulkarni said. Most Hindu families will follow a month-long fast and some will have just one meal in a day.
 
 On the last day before the beginning of shravan, a number of families feast on non-vegetartian food as it will be forbidden for a month and also invite theirneighbours and friends for the ritual popular as gatari.
