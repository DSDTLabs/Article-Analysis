NEW DELHI: A   trying to save himself from an angry crowd ended up mowing down a 42-year-old man in west Delhi’s   on Sunday. 

 Police claimed the man first hit a two-year-old girl and then ran over a man who was trying to stop him from fleeing the spot in his vehicle.
 
 Police said they received a PCR call around 4.45 pm from a passerby who witnessed the incident. A team that rushed to the spot arrested the driver. 
 
 Police said the errant driver, Hari Gupta, had been heading towards his house in Vishnu Garden and had taken a shortcut alongside Pacific Mall in Subhash Nagar. While he was driving, his car went over the hand of a two-year-old girl identified as Komal, who was playing by the road. The girl cried for help and people living in the slums along the road surrounded the vehicle. Gupta panicked on seeing a crowd gather and stepped on the accelerator.
 
 “We asked him to come out of the car. Instead, he started moving ahead. Lallan, who was standing in front of the car, came under the wheels. The driver did not stop the car and continued to drive, dragging him along,” Komal’s father, Vanmadhar, claimed, adding that the driver fled after the incident. There was no ambulance available. A video shot by locals showed a Sikh man giving his turban to secure the body in an e-rickshaw so that Lallan could be taken to hospital.
 
 Both Komal and Lallan were taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in an e-rickshaw. The girl received multiple stitches on her right hand, while Lallan succumbed to his injuries.
 
 The deceased, from Uttar Pradesh, had been living in the area since 1988 and worked here as an electrician. The family took the body to their village after the autopsy.
 
 Meanwhile, police intercepted Gupta’s vehicle and arrested him. “A case under Sections 337 and 304 of the IPC was registered against him,” said a senior police officer.
