CHENNAI: Police cracked down on   selling   in Tambaram and arrested two people on Thursday following the   whose throat was   earlier this week. At least 30   were seized from their shops. 

 Police said they nabbed Muthuvel Pandi, 45, and Jothi Ganesan, 51, in two separate raids at their shops in Anakaputhur in the city suburbs. 
 
 On Tuesday evening, a 40-year-old software engineer died after the killer thread slashed his throat as he was passing by on his bike. C Sivaprakasam was riding the vehicle while his father Chandrasekaran, 73, was riding pillion.
 
 Sivaprakasam lost control of the vehicle and smashed into an iron railing on the side of the road. He was flung off the vehicle due to the impact. Sivaprakasam and his father, both residents of Kolathur, had gone to check out a piece of land at Agaram and were returning home when the incident occurred. Sivaprakasam was an engineer in a private company in Thiruvanmiyur. 
 
 The city police commissioner has issued an order to crack down on shopkeepers who sell the deadly manja thread. Police first imposed a partial ban on the sale and use of manja in 2007, after the death of a two-year-old boy, before completely banning it in 2011, with section 1 of the City Police Act proscribing the flying of kites with the manja thread.
 
 In September 2012, the Chennai Katradi Urpathiyalargal Virpanayalargal Sangam, an association of kite manufacturers, moved the Madras high court, seeking a direction to restrain the city police from interfering with the manufacture and sale of kites and manja in Chennai. The court refused to lift the ban.
