In the TV show ' ', Babuji ( ) explains the significance of Republic Day and democracy to the residents of his housing society. However, his son Ghotak ( ) feels that democracy has lost its value in India.
Just then, a corrupt politician comes to town with several sacks of grains claiming that it is for a lavish meal that has been planned for people on R-Day. Though everyone feels that there is something fishy about the sacks, Babuji tells them not to be judgmental. However, Girigit Mausi ( ) realises that it is full of hard cash when she accidentally stumbles upon it, and informs Babuji.
 A responsible citizen, Babuji gives the cash to the police and replaces the sacks with real grains. Shocked to find the cash missing, the neta threatens to beat up everyone if he doesn’t get his money back and begins a search operation.
 Says Paresh, “The character I play disagrees with Babuji’s political ideologies, but he proves his patriotism with his actions against the corrupt politician. This gives people like Ghotak a reason to believe in democracy.” 
 'Chidiyaghar' airs Monday to Friday at 9 pm on Sony SAB.
