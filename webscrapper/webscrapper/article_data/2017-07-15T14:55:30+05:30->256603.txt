GUWAHATI: Local boy Kenny Basumatary, who directed the martial arts comedy series Local Kung Fu, will be seen playing the role of Netaji   in ' ', which is set to be released on July 28. Kenny will play one of the most crucial roles in the Tigmanshu Dhulia film. 

 "I hope I have been able to bring enough of Netaji. I read three very important books, including two biographies of Netaji and another book on Indian National Army (INA), and went through as many videos and recordings of his speeches as available. He was a highly educated gentleman and I tried to bring that persona in the character," Kenny told TOI from Mumbai. 
 
 'Raag Desh' is about the 1945 court martial of three INA officers who were captured during their failed attempt to throw the British out of India, and how the Red Fort trials (as they came to be known) galvanized public opinion against the British raj. Netaji appears in certain important flashbacks in the film. 
 
 "I had to rehearse some of Netaji's speeches at least 300 times. And for the physical preparation it used to take about an hour every day, with shaving of my head, makeup, padding and costumes," added Kenny, who has earlier worked with Dhulia in 'Yaara'. 
 
 The three officers were coincidentally a Hindu ( ), a Muslim (Shah Nawaz Khan) and a Sikh (Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon). Their roles are being played by Mohit Marwah, who is Anil Kapoor's nephew,   and Amit Sadh.
