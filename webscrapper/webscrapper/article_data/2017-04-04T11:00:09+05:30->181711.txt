CHANDIGARH: The   (MHA) has alerted police and central agencies in Punjab as well as Jammu and Kashmir of a   (LeT) plan to use a   to film key Army areas and strategic locations in the two border states. 

 The MHA's detailed warning to Punjab Police comes barely weeks after a report by the Parliamentary panel headed by former Union minister P Chidamabram pointed out glaring lapses by state cops to take preventive action despite "credible intelligence inputs that were received" and delay in action after the first intercept of phone call between terrorists and their handlers in Pakistan.
 
 The MHA has identified Pakistan-based LeT handler   as the man tasked with it. LeT handler Hanzia Adnan has planned to carry out fidayeen and terror attacks in some parts of Srinagar, Samba industrial city till Gurdaspur-Brahmna Road to Tibri near Army camp and Gurdaspur to Dinanagar road,“ says an MHA note to Punjab, dated March 31.
 
 The note seeks strengthening of the “second line of defence” along the India-Pakistan borders by the Punjab Police in six areas, including Amritsar Rural, Tarn Taran, Batala, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Ferozepur and Fazilka.
 
 Punjab had recently seen two terror attacks in the space of six months, first being at Dinanagar in July 2015 followed by that in Pathankot in January 2016.
 
 After that a pre-poll IED blast at Maur in February had left seven dead. Overall, 21 people died in these incidents.
 
 The MHA note points out that Adnan has even hired a local Kashmiri to visit Punjab and Jammu to shoot videos of “various locations along with prominent roads”, and calls for “special checking and anti-sabotage vigil at hotels and sarais.”
 
 Punjab DGP Suresh Arora or ADGP (intelligence) Dinkar Gupta did not offer comments on the alerts.
