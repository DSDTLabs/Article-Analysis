PUNE: An initiative to link land records with Aadhaar numbers will be rolled out in the district on a pilot basis to check frauds and usher in transparency.

 With Aadhaar coverage in the district at 90%, talks are on with the   on rolling out the project. It would include the Aadhaar number of land buyers and sellers being entered into the 7/12 extracts or property documents.
 
 Pune Divisional Commissioner S   said the linking would prevent impersonations and other frauds. “If the property document is linked with the Aadhaar numbers of buyers and sellers, it would help check cases of fraudulent deals,” Chockalingam told TOI.
 
 The 7/12 extract is the basic document needed for owning land. An official said the move will ensure the sellers do not end up selling their lands to multiple people. Once the pilot is rolled out, the state will set up a data hub with all the repository of the land documents.
