Chandigarh: The Haryana excise and taxation department filed a police complaint against a Gurugram-based firn, Vipin Enterprises, on Friday for allegedly acquiring an input tax credit of Rs 50.34 crore through fraudulent enteries.

 The complaint, which has since been turned into an FIR, was filed after it was found that there was no office of Vipin Enterprises at the address it gave and barber shop was functioning from there. The dealer had also submitted a mobile phone number which was answered by a different person, identified as one Rakesh Arora.
 
 The complainant by excise and taxation officer (ETO) alleged that Vipin Enterprises used input tax credit of Rs 50.34 crore under   through fraudulent entries. The GST number of the dealer has been cancelled.
 
 The firm had also committed bogus transactions under VAT by making fraudulent claims of input tax credit on intra-state purchases in a web of operations. It further showed bogus inter-state purchases to obtain ‘C’ forms worth Rs 27.16 crore from the department and facilitated the selling firms for concessional rate of tax.
 
 Excise and taxation minister Captain Abhimanyu said the department officers and the tax research unit had identified some dealers indulging in these “fraudulent” activities. “Some other dealers are also likely to be acted against and penalised shortly,” the minister said, adding that the registration certificate of the firm had already been cancelled under the Haryana GST and Central GST Act to prevent any further fraudulent activity by the dealer.
