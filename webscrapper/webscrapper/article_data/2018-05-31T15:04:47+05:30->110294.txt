LUDHIANA: Government bank employees went on a two-day strike from Wednesday against the offer of 2% hike in their wages offered by the   ( ). The employees — on a call given by United Forum of Bank Unions ( ) — gathered on Wednesday outside Canara Bank in Bharat Nagar Chowk, and staged a protest.

 
 Speaking on the occasion, UFBU convenor Naresh Gaur said: “The chief labour commissioner called a meeting on 28 May, and tried his best to resolve the strike issue, but no positive development took place, and as a result, we had to go ahead with the strike. The IBA began discussions with our unions last year with the assurance that the discussions would be completed by October last year, but IBA kept avoiding the issue of proper wage revision, and never made any offer on the question of wage increase. After patiently waiting for such a long time this year, IBA offered a meagre 2% hike in wages, stating that the financial position of banks was such that they could not offer better wage revision, as bank profits had eroded in recent years. This is completely false, and therefore we had to take the bitter decision of going on strike.”
 
 According to Pawan Thakur, president, Punjab Bank Employees Federation (PBEF), Ludhiana unit: “Banks have been consistently earning operating profits year after year. Nearly 70% of the hard-earned profits have evaporated due to provisions for bad loans and NPAs. Hence, denying reasonable wage revision to bank employees and officers on this count is unfair, and amounts to cheating. All bank employee unions have rejected this offer, and have demanded adequate increase in salary. We have also demanded that all scales/grades of officers be included in wage revision, as had been the practice since 1979. Until our demands are met, we will be forced to take harsh steps like protests and strikes to get our right from IBA.”
