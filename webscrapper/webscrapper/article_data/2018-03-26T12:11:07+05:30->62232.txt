KOTTAYAM: The  , except in   district, are sht on Monday from 6 AM to 1 PM, to protest the inaction from the authorities on the repeated attacks and violence on the establishments across the state. 

 The   have demanded that the government should formulate laws to give ample protection to the functioning of the fuel stations. The move is following the robbery at a fuel station in Pampady near here where a staff at the station was attacked by a four-man gang during night time and around Rs 1.5 lakhs of rupees was looted recently. 
 
 The president of the federation K P Sivanandan said that in the last two months five similar cases were registered in Kottayam district alone. 
 Similar incidents are being reported across the state. The safety of the staff working at fuel stations during night time is at risk. It is difficult to get employees to work at night. The cops are also not probing such crime efficiently to bring the culprits behind bars, he said.
 
 However, the fuel stations in Kannur are functioning as usual. 
 
  General Secretary K V Ramachandran said that the association is abstaining from the strike since it is examination time for students and also taking into consideration of the general strike to be held on April 2.
