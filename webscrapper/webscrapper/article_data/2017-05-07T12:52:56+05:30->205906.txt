 “He then came out, locked the door from outside, and went to the farm on the outskirts of the city where his younger brother Ashok (42) was asleep. Around 2am he reached the farm and targeted Ashok. One of his nephews Narayan Ramkishan Tode (30) and worker Sakharam (40) who were asleep nearby by woke up following a commotion. Narayan screamed at Pralhad, who rushed towards his nephew and attacked him with the axe. However, the nephew and their servant managed to flee from the scene towards the village,” said Kulknarni.
 
 After hacking his brother to death, Pralhad consumed a poisonous liquid. By this time, Narayan had alerted villagers and relatives who rushed to the spot to find Ashok’s body in a pool of blood and Pralhad in a semi-conscious state. They rushed both of them to the hospital. The police arrested Pralhad and filed a chargesheet before the Biloli district and sessions court.
