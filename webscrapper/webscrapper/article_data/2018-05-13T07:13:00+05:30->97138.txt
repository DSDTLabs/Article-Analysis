Gurgaon: A 26-year-old woman, originally from Nepal, registered a complaint on Friday against a man, accusing him of molesting and thrashing her. 

 The alleged assault took place on Thursday around 10pm outside Essel Towers on MG Road, where the woman had gone with her friends. The complainant, a resident of Civil Lines, said, the man was a friend of one of her friends.
 
 “My friend and I were standing outside the society and talking when a friend of hers, Vikrant Kalra, also arrived there. Initially, he was talking normally, but a while later he started making obscene gestures. I ignored him at first, but then he grabbed my hand and started touching me inappropriately. When I resisted, he abused and hit me. When my friend also objected, he threatened to kill us and then fled from the spot,” the girl said in her complaint.
 
 The woman went to Sector 29 police station along with her friend and filed a complaint against the accused on Friday. An FIR was registered under sections 323 (causing hurt), 354 ( ), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC.
