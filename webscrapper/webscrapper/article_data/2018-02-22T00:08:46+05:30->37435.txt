Indore: Indoreans will get to see more hippopotamus with the birth of a calf in the Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalaya of Indore on Wednesday.  An 18-year-old hippopotamus, Nanda, gave birth to the calf. Zoo’s curator Nihar Parulekar said that the gender of the newborn will be known only after a few days when the mother allows them to go near it.  With the birth of the hippo, the total number of hippopotamus (pachyderm) in the zoo has gone up to five.  The calf which was born on Tuesday late night has become a centre of attraction for visitors. The baby hippo was seen with its mother the entire day.  Zoo officials said that they are extra careful about the safety of the mother and newborn. They are keeping a watch on both the animals.  “We have our staff deployed there to keep a vigil on the activities of mother and the calf. We are also trying to keep the newborn inside water for longer period,” they said, adding that they were also taking care of health of the mother by providing her all supplements and nutrients.  It will take at least three to four months for the mother to introduce the newborn to the other members of the group, they added.
