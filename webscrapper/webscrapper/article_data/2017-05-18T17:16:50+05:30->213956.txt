Life is so unpredictable."

She was such a wonderful lady and she was the closest one on the sets to me. I shared a great rapport with her. She was an elder sister to me. Everyone used to address her as Maa on the sets. Once she got food for me which was her especiality. I will be attending her last rites today."

  Actor Viraf Patel, who played her on screen son on the show, burst into tears while talking to Times Of India over the phone. He said, "I was just talking to a colleague from Naamkarann and got to know that she was working till last evening. I can't believe that she is no more with us. She was such a hardworking and meticulous lady. She was one of the most gorgeous ladies that I have ever met. She was majestic at her work and we all used to blush just looking at her when she used to give her shots. It is a heartbreaking news for me."
  
  Viraf shared a picture of himself with Reema Lagoo on Instagram and wrote, " Dear Reemaji,
  Strangely, late last night while you may have been grappling with your last breadth i was awake going through the stills of #naamkarann and guess what i stumbled upon? This photograph i had pulled aside, to send it to you. But now I wake up to news of you moving on to another form; another world and my hands have a strange tremble as i type this.
  This picture for me is our most special picture, amongst many others as it somewhat captures the quiet offscreen bond we had. The love and authority you would scold me with, encourage me with, guide me with, be mad at me will always remain special. Your smile, your tenacity, your sense of humour, your love for life, your enthusiasm for acting even after doing it for over 4 decades shone through as much as you.
  Am so glad we made up the last time we fought and i got to say sorry and you said lets make a new beginning Viraf, am so glad I got a chance to work all those hours with you and learn from you, all that i did. Am just very sorry for not sending you this pic earlier but am sure eventually you will see this note and picture, in your own way just the way you managed to do so most things that didnâ€™t meet your gorgeous eyes. till then ..#withlove your last (onscreen) son."
  
  
  
  Zain Imam, who plays the leap now shared a message on Instagram and wrote, "A very humble human being. I still remember i used to tease you and that pat u would give me on my back. A god mother to half of #bollywood and a mentor to us. It was indeed a pleasure working with u ma'am #rip #Reemalagoo ji # May u shower ur blessings on us from heaven P.s:I would still remember u as kokkie ji from #shreemaan shreemati."
