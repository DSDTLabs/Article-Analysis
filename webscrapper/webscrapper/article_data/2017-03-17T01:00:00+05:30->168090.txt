  According to sources, some parts of the film directed by Kabir will be shot in India and the filmâ€™s team has also submitted an application to the I&B Ministry seeking permission to shoot in the city.
 
  A source tells us, "There have been talks about shooting the film in Delhi, and most probably some parts of the film will be shot here. They are in touch with the I&B ministry officials to get permissions for shooting. However, nothing has been finalised yet."
 
  To confirm whether the film will be shot in Delhi, when we contacted Eros International's   banner, under which the two films are being shot, they neither agreed nor denied it.

  However, the film's team didn't take the Film Facilitation Office's (FFO) route to finalise the locations. Vikramjit Roy, the FFO chief, says, "We would be more than happy to facilitate the Indo-China collaboration project in Delhi or in any other state. But we have not been contacted by Kabir Khan or anyone else regarding the same." However, the FFO officials told us that they have facilitated a number of Chinese projects in India. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  Roy says, "In the last three years, after the Indo-China film treaty was signed, India has become quite a favourite destination for Chinese filmmakers. Last year, Future Homes (web series) of M/s First and Ten Productions was shot in India. Now that Kabir Khan will be shooting his first Indo-Chinese film, it will also attract other filmmakers to shoot here."
 
  Kabir Khan was also in China last month for a location recce for his film. The film will be released as a local movie in China.
