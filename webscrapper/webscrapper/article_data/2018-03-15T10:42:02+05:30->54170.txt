KOZHIKODE: In a bizarre incident,   has asked MCJ (master of communication and journalism) graduates of the 2012 batch to surrender their degree certificates and mark lists, five years after the students have passed out, after finding that the it had failed to include marks of a paper in the  .

 The   has issued a memo to students – who had passed out from the department of journalism and mass communication in 2012 – asking them to surrender their original and provisional degree certificates and mark lists within five days ‘for verification and further action’.
 
 It is learnt that the varsity had not included the MCJ examination paper ‘corporate communication’ in the mark list of the fourth semester examination issued to the students. Also, the final results and grades were calculated omitting the marks of that particular paper.
 
 “One paper was left out in the digitally generated tabulation register (TR) in 2012 and the concerned section officer in   at that time failed to notice it and erroneous certificates were issued to students. We found the mistake when a student applied for his degree certificate. Now, we have asked all students of the batch who had received their original certificates to surrender them along with the mark list to make necessary corrections,”said varsity’s controller of examinations V V Georgekutty.
 
 He added that action would be taken against the section officer responsible for the lapse. 
 
 “Though some students had brought the issue to the attention of Pareeksha Bhavan authorities soon after the publication of results, varsity authorities had informed that the marks in the varsity computer system were correct and the original degree certificates to be issued later would reflect that,” said a former student of the department.
 
 Varsity authorities said that the vice-chancellor has issued an order to make corrections in the mark list and degree certificates.
