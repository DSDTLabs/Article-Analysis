NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister   on Friday wrote to human resource minister  , urging him to call for a day-long meeting with all state   to discuss ways to strengthen the assessment and examination system. Sisodia also expressed his concerns over the leak of other papers in the letter.

 While two papers have already been cancelled, “there have been concerns regarding leaks of several other papers as well,” Sisodia said. 
 
 “Not only does it affect the future of 26 lakh students, but also puts a question mark on the sanctity of the   assessment system; a system on which students, parents and schools from all over the country place their trust,” the deputy chief minister added.
 
 He urged the minister to call for meeting with all state ministers to discuss the current examination and assessment system, saying “this is an issue on which we need to move beyond party politics. When a paper is leaked, the consequences are faced by the entire country, and not just a government or a party,” Sisodia said.
 
 While stressing on the need to collectively find a solution, Sisodia wrote, “If exam papers are leaked, undeserving students perform well and hardworking ones are left behind. This means the country gets low quality officials, teacher, doctors and engineers.”
