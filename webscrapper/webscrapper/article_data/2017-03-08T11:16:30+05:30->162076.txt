CUTTACK: A four-member team of the   (MCI) visited government-run   and Hospital here on Tuesday to review   and  . 

 The visit assumes significance as MCI during its last visit in September had expressed serious displeasure over insufficient infrastructure in the medical college and had recommended against renewal of 100 seats, which were added to existing seats in 2013. The MCI had made adverse remarks against SCB, which is the premier medical college in the state. Swinging into action after the MCI's strong stance, the state government and college authorities had taken measures to address the lacunae pointed out by the MCI and sent a compliance report to it in January.
 
 "The MCI team visited SCB campus to verify the contents mentioned in our compliance report. We have rectified problems raised by the MCI," said SCB superintendent Dr Shyama Kanungo.
 
 The team visited different departments of the hospital and examined staff strength, infrastructure, clinical facilities and equipment. Besides, the team also interacted with heads of departments and college authorities. Hospital sources said the MCI team seemed satisfied with the measures taken by state government to retain the 100 additional seats. The MCI team during its last visit had raised questions over shortage of adequate lecture theatres, examination halls, library, hostels and lack of adequate casualty officers. Adding to it, the MCI had also raised objection over experience of the superintendent.
