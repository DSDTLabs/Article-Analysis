VISAKHAPATNAM:   employees unions from across the country staged a   on Wednesday against the government’s move to stop production of 143 defence equipment in   and instead hand over the   to  

 Some of the defence equipment and products include ammunition and ammunition boxes, troop comfort items, extreme climate clothing, special binoculars and optical cables.
 
 Terming such a move a threat to national security besides jeopardising the future of defence   working in ordnance factories, the union members have decided to intensify the agitation in the coming months if the state government doesn’t reconsider its decision.
 
 “In Vizag, around 10,000 defence civilian members including Eastern Naval Command Employees (ENCE) Union, NSTL Civilian Employees Union and Naval Armament Depot (NAD) Civilian Employees Union participated in the protest in front of the main gates of their respective offices,” said GSJ Atchuta Rao, ENCE Union general secretary.
 
 General secretary of All-India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) C Srikumar said, “The country’s security will be at stake due to the decision as the private sector only focusses on profits. There are 41 ordnance factories in the country where around 88,000 defence civilians are employed. Privatisation will also lead to an uncertain future for these employees.”
