HYDERABAD: Almost 75 per cent of colleges inspected by the   Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H) recently have been found flouting norms laid down by the university, officials said. The colleges have been been issued notices and asked to explain the charges. 

 The surprise visits that started about two weeks ago have revealed that most colleges are not conducting classes as per schedule. "We first learnt about this through students and other sources. While we had been planning to pay surprise visits to confirm these allegations for a long time, we finally did so now. To our surprise, the allegation has proved to be true. We have concrete evidence to prove that colleges are flouting norms," said N  , registrar, JNTU-H.
 
 When asked if the findings of visits will have an impact on the affiliation of the colleges, the registrar said, "That will entirely depend on the explanation given by colleges. If it is not satisfactory, we will initiate action," adding that the objective of these visits was to ensure that classwork in the colleges go on as per schedule.
 
 "The Fact Finding Committee of the university largely concentrates on physical verification and also gives colleges a 48-hour notice. That allows them to fudge details and hide facts," Yadaiah alleged.
 
 College managements however termed the surprise visits as nothing more than a 'trick' played by   authorities to deny affiliation to private colleges. "In June 2014, we had 370 engineering and 126 pharmacy colleges. Now there are hardly 212 engineering and 86 pharmacy colleges. I am sure these numbers will be further reduced," said K Ramadass, convener,   and added that government is doing this only to avoid paying fee reimbursement to colleges.
 
 In March, teams from the   had conducted surprise raids on select technical colleges in the state. Its findings showed that nearly 50% of colleges in the state do not have basic facilities and indiscriminately flout norms.
