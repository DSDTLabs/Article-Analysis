 In a separate study, Praja found minor girls were victims in 72% of the total rape cases in 2016. “This means 7 out of 10 sexual assault victims were minor girls,” said Vaishnavi Mahurkar of Praja. In 2015, 43% of female sexual abuse victims were between 12 and 16 years. “The data reveals the shocking state of safety of children in the city. Despite the fact that crimes against women have increased over the years, conviction has remained low,” said Nitai Mehta, founder of Praja.
