With the declaration of the Class X   results comes the dilemma most students face - which stream should they opt for. 

 
 With a wide range of subjects on offer, students can sometimes find it difficult to take a decision. I advise students to make their choice on the basis of their individual strengths and weaknesses, not basing it on hearsay or following the herd.
 
 In addition, it is possible that one may not get the   one wants. Change of board or   might also seem difficult at first. But one needs to be prepared for such situations.
 
 Many think that the choice of stream actually comes into play after Class XII. I think that an early start is always better. Your passion, your area of interest is vital. 
 
 They say, follow your passion. And I think it's a good policy to follow. Sit down with a paper and pen. Write down what your areas of interest are. All of them. Then keep eliminating the ones that seem least appealing to you. Eventually, you will be left with the one thing that you are most passionate about - and that is your calling.
 
 Parents have a major role to play in the selection of subjects as well. However, they should not impose their decision on children.
