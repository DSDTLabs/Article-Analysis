PANAJI: The GSDP or  , which is an indicator of the  , has been sliding for the past four years and this has given fodder to the opposition’s attempt to derail  . 

 But, for the BJP, a lot rides on the votes of nearly 3 lakh women and elderly person, who have been getting monthly financial assistance from the government through different schemes. The assistance ranges from Rs 1200 to Rs 2000 a month. But, this social security web weaved by the BJP has has taken a toll on the state’s treasury. 
 
 The GSDP or the state income is the most important economic indicator used to measure the growth and the level of development in a state. When the economy went out of gear due to closing of illegal mining in 2012, the GSDP slumped to just above 4% in 2012-2013 from 20% in the previous year. 
 
 An anxious BJP government doled out financial incentives to assuage popular sentiments. 
 
 There are 1,39,451 elderly beneficiaries who recive a monthly incentive of about Rs 2,000 and nearly 1,40,000 women get Rs 1,200 under Griha Adhaar scheme to support their family every month. More than 34,000 applications were sanctioned under Laadli Laxmi Scheme under the BJP government. The mining dependent also received relief in form of financial support and debt relief scheme. 
 
 To ebb the unrest after mining ban, the government floated a scheme for the ‘Welfare of mining-affected people’. The truck owners engaged in mining operations and drivers, who had lost their employment benefited financially from the scheme. For the last three years, nearly 8,000 people have taken advantage of the scheme. 
 
 Goa chief minister   on Sunday said that benefits of the government-backed schemes have touched every household in the state, which he claimed has happened for the first time under any administration. “The BJP-led Government has touched every household through its schemes during the last five years,” he added, addressing a meeting in Cortalim constituency.
 
 But, this has come at a price. The previous Congress government had witnessed an average GSDP increase of 12% with the lowest being 5.54% in 2007-08 and highest being 20.20% in 2011-12. After the BJP government came to power in March 2012, the GSDP plunged to 4.17% in 2012-13 and went just above 7% in the next two years. 
 
 But the public debt, which stood at Rs 6,872 crore in 2012 has now touched Rs 10,836 crore in March 2016, indicating massive borrowing of Rs 800 to 900 crore every year. This will be the main challenge facing the next government.
