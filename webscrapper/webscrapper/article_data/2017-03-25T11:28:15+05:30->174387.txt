KOCHI: Police have registered a case of rape against a 14-year-old boy after a   confirmed that he had fathered the baby of a minor girl, three years his senior. 

 Besides charging him under IPC Section 376 (punishment for rape), police have also invoked sections 3 (penetrative sexual assault) and 5 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the  , while the girl has been charged under sections 7 (sexual assault) and 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the same act.
 
 It was earlier reported that the boy was 12, but police records said he was now 14.
 
 "He was studying in Class VIII and then aged 13 when he impregnated the girl. We registered two separate cases against them after seeking legal opinion," inspector of   S   said.
 
 Sources in the forensic department, however, cited a blood sample test to put the boy's age at 13.
 
 Legal experts, meanwhile, said though the charges against both the teens would stand, the juvenile justice board was likely to waive the punishments.
 
 "Rape charge cannot be slapped on the girl since it is legally not possible," said criminologist (retired)  . The case came to light when the girl delivered a baby girl at a hospital here in November last.
 
 Meanwhile, a medical expert said boys as young as 10 could impregnate a woman. 
 
 "Boys become capable of masturbation after 10 years. There have been reports of early pregnancies in which both the parents are minors," Dr   said, adding that boys, too, were attaining early puberty.
 
 IVF specialist Dr Parasuram Gopinath said children's exposure to explicit adult content has been resulting in hormonal changes in them, which leads them to explore their sexuality. 
 
 Dr  , former principal of Thrissur Government Medical College, said precocious puberty has now become common. 
 
 "Exposure to explicit content is making them adults early," he said.
