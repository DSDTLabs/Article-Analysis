Featuring  , the play   ( ) is set to be staged at Prayog Studio on May 6 (7 pm)

  The play is a celebration of womanhood –be it a housewife, homemaker, daughter or sister. Shobha can be found in most of the houses cooking, cleaning and making others happy. But sadly, very few notice her contribution towards the society and country. Gruhashobha is a tribute to all those unsung house heroines, who happily and easily compromise their lives to keep others happy.
 
  It’s a story that reiterates that fact that one should never underestimate the power of a homemaker.
