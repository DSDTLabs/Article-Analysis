Noida: The   and Yamuna expressway authorities are all set to tabulate their annual budgets in June, which will be allocated to the two areas in the current financial year. According to sources, nearly Rs 10,000 crore will be allocated to the two areas in 2017-18. While Noida is likely to put aside nearly Rs 6,000 crore,   is likely to have a   of Rs 4,000 crore. 

 The board meetings of Noida and Yamuna authorities will be held on June 2 & 9 respectively to finalise the budget. According to sources, the Noida Authority is likely to spend only Rs 6,000 crore this year, nearly Rs 3,000 crore less than last year’s budget of Rs 9,024 crore. Due to fund crunch faced by the Authority, several proposed projects will remain on hold including two proposed Metro projects. They are the Sector 71-Greater Noida West line and Sector 142 -Botanical Metro line
 
 The focus will be on completing ongoing projects first rather than taking up any new ones. This includes the two under-construction Metro routes, the city’s first elevated road, several underpasses, parking facilities, parallel bridge on Okhla Barrage between Noida and Delhi, etc. 
 
 YEIDA is expected to allocate a budget similar like last year, which was Rs 4,028 crore. While farmers are going to lead high on this year’s budget with nearly Rs 1,500 crore, it also plans to put aside Rs 1,200 crore for infrastructure development.
