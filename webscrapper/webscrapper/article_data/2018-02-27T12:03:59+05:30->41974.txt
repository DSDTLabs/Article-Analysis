PATNA: Governor   has said there has been a sharp decline in the cases of murder, dacoity, loot, riot and kidnapping for ransom in   since the enforcement of prohibition in the state on April 5, 2016.

 The cases of dacoity and kidnapping for ransom fell by 24% to 28% in 2016 and 2017, the governor said while addressing a joint sitting of the legislative assembly and council on Day 1 of the Budget session on Monday.
 
 Maintaining that the rule of law is the state government’s top priority, the governor said strict actions were taken to check organised crime and maintain law and order. The police machinery has been so strengthened that the men in khaki can competently discharge their duties, the governor said amid thumping of desk by the ruling members.
 
 Referring to the National Crime Record Bureau’s data for 2016, the governor said the national average of cognizable offences is 233.6/lakh population, but it is just 157.4/lakh in Bihar. In terms of the average rate of cognizable offences, Bihar ranks 22nd among the states and Union Territories. 
 
 Malik said police have solved most of the crime cases in 2017 and arrested the accused. At least 5, 858 accused were convicted through speedy trial in 2017, he said.
 
 Highlighting the steps taken for women empowerment,   said at least 4,473 women were provided job in different departments after the state government introduced 35% reservation for the fair sex in the state government’s jobs in January 2016. Of them, 3,672 were recruited in police department. 
 
 The state government, the governor said, has implemented ‘Jeevika’ scheme for integrated development of poor and disadvantaged women and promoting the habit of savings among them. A total of 7.47 lakh self-help groups, 44,485 village-level organisations and 632 cluster-level unions have so far been constituted under the   scheme for empowerment of rural women.
