GHAZIABAD: The   (UPSRTC) has floated tenders to acquire 250   and it is expected that in two months all buses plying in Delhi-NCR will be converted to CNG. The step has been taken keeping with the measures suggested under PMO-formulated Air Pollution Abatement Action Plan in Delhi-NCR.

 
 “We have floated tenders for 250   buses which we plan to include in our fleet that will take the total number of CNG buses to 327 in two months from now,” said  , regional manager, UPSRTC. “Presently, we have only 77 CNG buses that operate in   from Kaushambi bus terminal in Ghaziabad and Morna bus stand in Noida,” added Bose.
 
 This is considered to be a major step in phasing out diesel buses which are operational in Delhi-NCR. “Initially, these CNG buses will operate across Delhi, Faridabad, Noida and Gurgaon, but later they will be introduced for long routes,” said Bose.
 
 There are 44 routes in Noida and Ghaziabad that have been short-listed where these buses will ply. Of these, 36 will ply from Kaushambi bus terminal, while remaining will start from Noida Sector 35 bus stand.
 
 On long routes, UPSRTC has around 900 diesel buses that make intra-state movements from Kaushambi bus stand. “We are under constraint of not introducing CNG buses for long routes because in far districts there is no facility of CNG filling stations and in one go, these buses can travel only up to 700 km. But government is making efforts to extend CNG filing stations in other districts as well,” said Bose.
