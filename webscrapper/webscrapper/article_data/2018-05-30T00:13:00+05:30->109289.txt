Pimpri Chinchwad: To ensure timely payment of property taxes and water charges with arrears, Pimpri Chinchwad standing committee member Amit Gawde has said the due date should be extended till July 31.

 There are 4.87 lakh registered properties in the city. The municipal corporation gives ten per cent property tax concession to those who pay the bill by June 30.
 
 Ex-servicemen and freedom fighters or their wives, and properties registered in the names of women are entitled to 50% concession in general tax. People with more than 40% disability are also given concessions, property tax officials said. 
 
 The citizens should avail tax concessions in time and clear their dues so that the municipal corporation gets revenue, Gawde added.
 
 The citizens would get 20 days for paying taxes after receiving the bill. However, the property tax department is yet to print and disburse property  , Gawde said.
 
 The civic body has given the order for printing bills to the contractor who will disburse it within the first week of June.
