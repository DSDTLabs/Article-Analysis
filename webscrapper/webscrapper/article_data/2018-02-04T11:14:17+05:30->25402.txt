ALLAHABAD: The   ( ) visited the Uttar Pradesh Public Service   ( ) headquarters on Saturday to probe the alleged irregularities in the selection of 362 bureaucrats and police officers during the   rule from April 2012 to March 2017.

 The CBI is investigating the irregular selection of 178 deputy collectors and 184 deputy superintendents of police during the SP rule, who were among the 9,374 candidates selected in PCS or Combined State Upper Subordinate Exams and other competitive exams.
 
 Secretary, UPPSC, Jagdish said, "We have been cooperating with the CBI officials to unearth any possible scam. I hope that the commission will come out clean."
 
 One of the discrepancies being investigated include the quota policy, which was implemented in 2013 during the second stage of the PCS exam by commission chairman Anil  . In May 2013, the commission decided to apply caste-based quota in every stage of Provincial   exams -- prelims, mains and interviews -- as against the provision of applying reservation while preparing list for interviews.
 
 Later, while hearing a slew of petitions against the quota policy by some candidates, Allahabad high court reserved the judgement on July 21, 2013. However before the court decision, UPPSC revoked its three-tier reservation policy ending dispute and also amended results of mains exams of PCS-2011. 
 
 Even in the case of PCS-2012 and PCS-2013, Yadav decided not to publish names and category of successful candidates after the commission was criticised for favouring a particular caste in selection process. Similarly, only roll numbers of successful candidates were published in PCS-2014. It was for the first time in the history of the Commission that such a decision was taken to hide the identity of selected candidates.
 
 In the case of PCS-2015, there were allegations of paper-leak of prelims exams and change of copy in the mains exams. .
