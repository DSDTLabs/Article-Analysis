Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday asked the forest department about the measures it has taken to develop forest region of Pandharkawda in order to curb problems related to man-animal conflict.

 The court was hearing a PIL filed by Dr Jerryl Banait over the shooting orders of tigress T-1 on suspicion of it being a man-eater. The bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Arun Upadhyay asked the forest department to provide details of steps being taken to develop the forests and look after well-being of animals.
 
 Tigress T-1 is currently nursing her cubs due to which a stay has been put on the shooting order.
 
 The department also has orders to capture another tiger, T-2. The tigress is nursing two cubs due to which the entire situation is being handled with sensitivity.
 
 Currently, the tigress is in same districtâ€™s Pandarkawda area and efforts are on to capture it along with her two cubs. According to petitioners, not enough has been done by the forest department to ensure that adequate prey base is available for tigers so that they do not enter human habitation.
 
 In their affidavit, the forest department has pointed out to their afforestation efforts by mentioning various plantation drives.
 
 On January 29, PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra had issued orders to shoot the tigress. Two problem tigers, a male and a female, have killed 10 persons and over 50 cattle in the last 18 months in Ralegaon forest area encompassing agriculture fields.
 
 The delivery of cubs exposed glitches in monitoring reports by local officials on the basis of which they sought shoot orders for the tigress. The last human kill by the tigress was on January 27. As crop in the farms have been harvested, there is low human movement in the territorial and FDCM areas.
