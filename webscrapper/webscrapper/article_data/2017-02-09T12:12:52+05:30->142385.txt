MYSURU: A Muslim doctor is doing his bit to quell the   panic by asking his community members to go ahead with the vaccination. Due to rumours, parents in areas, where Muslims are in sizeable numbers, were apprehensive about the vaccination programme. But Dr  , district family planning officer, convinced parents to get their children vaccinated.

 On Tuesday, parents in Rajeevnagar, Shanthinagar, Ghosianagar and Kyathmaranahalli didn’t come forward to get their children vaccinated. Of around 45,000 children in the area, only 70 got vaccinated on Tuesday. DHO Dr Basavaraj and Dr Siraj went to these areas and created awareness among the people. Dr Siraj distributed pamphlets in Urdu about the importance of vaccination. With the support of local corporator  , he went to various schools and even convened a meeting of community elders. He brought a few vaccinated children to demostrate that nothing adverse would happen.
 
 Thanks to his efforts, many parents in these areas brought their children and around 400 children were vaccinated. Dr Ahmed said, “Many people in these areas are from Kerala and some mentioned that they had received messages from their relatives and friends from Kerala that children were falling ill after being vaccinated. There were also rumours that such injections were being given to reduce the population. To instil confidence among people, we brought a few children vaccinated with the measles-rubella vaccine. People were reassured and on Wednesday, around 400 children were vaccinated.” 
 
 Dr  , who manages the   in Kyathmaranahalli, said around 24,400 children are attached to this centre. “On Tuesday, many parents resisted vaccination but on Wednesday, over 200 children were vaccinated.”
