CHENNAI: The   ( ) faction leader   on Sunday defended actor  's corruption charges against the ruling Edappadi K Palaniswami government in the state. He asked the state government to reply to the actor's charges, instead of threatening him. 

 "It is not good on the part of the state government to threaten actor Kamal Haasan for his remarks against the government. Kamal has the right to express his opinion. Instead of clarifying the doubts, the ministers are threatening the actor," Panneerselvam said, addressing party cadres at   in  , as part of the party founder M G Ramachandran's centenary celebrations.
 
 "I have asked the government to order a CBI enquiry into the death of Puratchithalaivi Amma. Even after Apollo Hospitals has agreed for such an enquiry, why is the state government yet to order an enquiry," Panneerselvam asked.
 
 The people of the state and the party cadres were firmly behind his faction, Panneerselvam said. "The people want us to expose the misdeeds of this government. Both the people and party cadres have warned us not to merge the two factions," he said.
 
 "We will continue on our path and hold district level meetings across the state. This will culminate in a massive rally in Chennai on October 17, MGR's birthday. This is a people's movement and they are firmly with us. Only those who have money are with the other faction. We will strive to expose those in power in the state," Panneerselvam said.
 
 Later, talking to reporters, Panneerselvam wanted the state government to hold the local body elections by August-end, as ordered by the Madras high court.
