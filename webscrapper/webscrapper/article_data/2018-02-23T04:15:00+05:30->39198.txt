Vadodara: Smoke continued to emanate from the solid waste dumping site at Jambuva in the southern part of the city. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been struggling to manage the situation since one week now.

 The fire had initially started on Friday and the VMC had a tough time controlling it. The civic body also started covering the garbage with earth using around 15 dumpers that worked throughout the day since the fire came to notice.
 
 Residents in the area have been complaining of smell emanating from the site and say that while the flames have been doused, smoke kept coming out of the site. 
 
 Suresh Palamel of Federation of Vadodara Residents Association, said, “We will be holding a meeting in the area on Friday and decide the future course of action. We are not averse to starting an agitation.”
 
 The opposition Congress to has picked up the issue and demanded that the municipal solid waste should be handled in a scientific manner. 
 
 City unit Congress vice president Shailesh Amin said that the civic body had not been able to segregate waste before disposing it off. 
 
 He said that the VMC was supposed to put a layer of earth over garbage every day, but had not done so. “If this had been done, the fire would have been controlled much easily,” he said.
 
 Environmentalist Rohit Prajapati said that that the fire was a health hazard as materials like plastics would have caught fire. 
 
 “It can have a chronic long-term effect on the health of people. Despite this, VMC has not even brought out an advisory regarding the situation,” Prajapati said. 
 
 He suggested that experts should be roped in to handle issues related to solid waste.
 
 Prajapati said that merely issuing notices to the VMC was not enough. “The Gujarat Pollution Control Board can file a criminal complaint against the VMC in the court,” he said.
