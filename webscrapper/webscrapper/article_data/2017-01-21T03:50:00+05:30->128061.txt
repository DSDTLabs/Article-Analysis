Panaji: Following the Supreme Court’s order stating that all cinema halls in India should play the national anthem before a feature film and that all present in the hall are obliged to stand up to show respect to it, the ministry of home affairs has issued guidelines for persons with disabilities, exempting some, but not all, from standing for the national anthem. Paraplegic writer Salil Chaturvedi who was physically assaulted by a fellow cinema goer at Inox, Panaji, last July because he didn’t stand up for the anthem, said he would like to see the guidelines displayed in all cinema halls in English and Konkani to avoid any confusion. His story went global following the incident and he even wrote to the management asking it to flash a message before the anthem reminding cinema goers of persons with disabilities and senior citizens present in the audience and to request them to refrain from forcing others to stand up.  Monika Kshatriya, former journalist and disabilities activist, said the guidelines do not address the problems of persons with disabilities. “These guidelines, in fact, make a mockery of physical and mental disabilities. What protects PWD from overzealous nationalists?” she asked. The Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) has welcomed the guidelines but takes strong objection to the symptoms of some disabilities specified which ridicule persons with disabilities. The ministry of home affairs has stated that the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities will suggest further modifications in the guidelines as and when required or necessary as the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill has been passed by both Houses of Parliament which recognizes 21 categories of disabilities where the issues concerning the new categories of disabilities also need to be considered after the notification is issued.
