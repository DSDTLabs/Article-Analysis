GUWAHATI: A notice banning the use of lipstick at Ghana Kanta Barua (GKB) College in Assam’s Morigaon district on Wednesday shocked girl students. Issued under the name of the students’ union, the notice evoked sharp reactions. 

 The union, however, rubbished the claims and blamed miscreants for distorting their notice and dragging them into a controversy. “We had issued a notice asking all students to attend college in uniform in order to ensure discipline. Without our knowledge, somebody altered the notice, saying that lipstick has been banned on campus,” said  , general secretary of the students’ union. 
 
 Education minister   said, “A free and democratic environment must exist in every college of the state. Authorities should act if anyone tries to curtail the personal freedom of students on college campuses.” 
 
 A student said, “We were surprised at the notice. I don’t know whether there was a distortion, but a   is a dictatorial order.”  , president of   College Principals’ Council, condemned the move, saying, “A college can prescribe uniform dress code for students. But dictating on cosmetics is ridiculous. In the name of discipline, rules intruding into the private life of students should not be framed.” A college spokesperson confirmed that the authorities didn’t hang the notice.
