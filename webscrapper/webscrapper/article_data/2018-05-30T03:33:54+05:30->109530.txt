MUMBAI: A   aircraft operating from Mumbai to London suffered a lightning strike on Tuesday. The return flight was delayed by over two hours as standard checks were carried out after the   777 landed at Heathrow. 

  Jet Airways flight 9W116 departed at 10.20am and landed in London at 2.45pm local time. The aviation weather report for London showed a thunderstorm and heavy rain. En route, the Boeing 777 was hit by lightning, which forced the airline to delay departure of   flight 9W115, said a Jet Airways spokesperson, adding that the airline was following the "statutory process'' and the departure had been pushed to 7.35pm local time.
 
  Modern day jets are designed to withstand lightning strikes with the passenger cabin well protected against electric currents. But there have been rare instances of passenger fatalities due to lightning strikes, which generally occur when an aircraft is lower than 20,000 feet and is passing close to a cumulonimbus cloud
 
  An Air New Zealand A320-200 aircraft from Auckland to   carried out a go-around after lightning struck on May 20.
