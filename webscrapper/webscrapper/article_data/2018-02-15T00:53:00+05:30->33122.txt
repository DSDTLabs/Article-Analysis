Coimbatore: Directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption sleuths, who have taken the custody of suspended vice-chancellor A Ganapathi, are having a tough time tracing the four cheques amounting to Rs 29 lakh that will help them nail the academician. The agency was granted custody of Ganapathi for four days from February 12. DVAC sleuths have been interrogating Ganapathi for the past two days to get clues on where the cheque leaves have been hidden. “We cannot reveal much information on this,” said an official. But sources said that Ganapathi has been reluctant to divulge any kind of information. He meets his advocate for half hour every day and discusses the developments on the case. In one statement, he has told the DVAC that the cheque leaves were handed over to his family members and in some statements; he has said he knows nothing about the cheque leaves. “It is evident that he will not reveal or confess to anything,” said an official. But legal experts said that unless the cheque leaves were found, the DVAC will find it difficult to prove the corruption charges in the court. The reason why DVAC used cheque leaves and not cash is because it is difficult to arrange for such a large sum and also if the money is seized, it will be stuck in court until the case ends. The four cheques were from Bank of India and were postdated with a sum of 10 lakh, 10 lakh, 5 lakh and 4 lakh each. On February 3, A Ganapathi and Dharmaraj were arrested on graft charges when T Suresh lodged a complaint with DVAC who caught them red-handed while receiving a bribe of Rs 30 lakh for confirming the probation period of Suresh as assistant professor. The police custody ends on February 16.
