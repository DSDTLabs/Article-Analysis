GURUGRAM: In a first in the city, a   in Hariyaheda village has started operations after successfully installing the   technology, which reduces suspended particulate matter and black carbon emissions while saving coal consumption. 

 Now, five more   kilns have applied for the permission to use the new technology, said a source at   (HSPCB). 
 
 Until December 2017, eight brick kilns had installed the zig-zag technology and applied for using the same, after the district administration imposed a ban on brick kilns in Gurugram and Nuh region in September. The ban came after an order from   (NGT) as traditional methods used in kilns are highly polluting.
 
 Chairman of the HSPCB, A K Khetarpal gave his nod for start of operations at the Hariyaheda brick kiln after carrying out an inspection there. 
 
 Khetarpal asked questions about the fuel consumption, the work flow and the technical aspects in the new technology.
 
 Jai Bhagwan, regional officer of HSPCB, said, “It’s a good development that brick kilns are moving to green technology. We hope that more companies will take a note of it and install the zig-zag technology.” 
 
 He added, “The applications by the brick kilns confirm that many have installed the zig-zag technology already. These applications will first go to our headquarters in Haryana and then to the environment pollution control authority (EPCA). EPCA will inspect the kiln and give them approval to operate.”
 
 There are 101 brick kilns in the district. A total of 95 are located in Nuh, Punhara and Firozpur Jhirka in Mewat and six are located in areas close to Sohna Road and Basai Road. Brick kilns release harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and suspended particulate.
