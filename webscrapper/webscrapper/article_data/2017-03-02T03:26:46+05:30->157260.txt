New  : Members of the National Democratic Teachers Front submitted a memorandum to the DU vice-chancellor, seeking a detailed inquiry into the   episode. Around 450 professors signed the memorandum.

 The teachers took out a march from Arts Faculty to the VC office. They said the VC could not sit down with them and discuss the matter because of prior engagements, but the memo was passed on to him.
 
 Pramod Shastri, member of the Rashtrawadi Shikshak Sangh and a teacher with the physical education department in Kirori Mal  , said the teachers wanted to know whether permission was sought from the VC about the talk in Ramjas College, in which   and Shehla Rashid of JNU were invited, if the permission had mentioned Khalid’s presence, and how it was cancelled. 
 
 “A large number of students and teachers who are not even part of DU are coming and joining the protests. For how long must this continue? Even on Tuesday, they spoke with the intention of provocation. Kanhaiya said show me where   is in the march. It is done in a manner that looks like a political rally,” he said.
 
 The teachers want the varsity to secure its environment against “elements who obstruct education in colleges”. They said students had on Wednesday left their classes and joined the march. “But today we asked teachers to finish their classes by 12.50pm,” said Shastri.
