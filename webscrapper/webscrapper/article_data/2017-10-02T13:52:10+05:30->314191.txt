JALANDHAR: Sikh groups are warring words with one another over Justice Ranjit Singh Commission issuing summons to the   chief, asking him to appear before it and the latter refusing to accept the same.

 The commission has been set up to inquire the Bargari sacrilege incident and subsequent firing on protestors at   in which two Sikhs were killed in 2015.
 
 While joining the controversy, former DSGMC president and SAD (Delhi) president Paramjit Singh Sarna said the SGPC should not become a hurdle in the delivery of justice and should rather work fot it, the Shiromani Khalsa Panchayat (SKP) said the decision of the SGPC was misleading. The panchayat asked if Guru Granth Sahib was supreme or the jathedar of Akal Takht.
 
 “It is misleading to say that the Commission has been formed by the   party as it has been formed by Captain Amardiner Singh’s government after Sikhs demanded justice in the case. Justice was denied by the   government. The SGPC remained silent when two protesting Sikhs were killed under Badal’s rule and now they are brazenly trying to scuttle justice,” Sarna alleged.
 
 “In place of becoming a Badals’ puppet, SGPC president   should have himself provided the record to the Commission. Any move to block justice in this case will amount to protecting the culprits of the sacrilege and police firing,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile SKP head Rajinder Singh, in a statement issued on Sunday said SGPC president Badungar and executive members should not forget that the issue pertained to sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and Sikhs wanted to know who were behind it. “Akal Takht jathedar is not above Guru Granth Sahib,” he said.
 
 “The SGPC should provide required record to the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission to help it to reach the truth about sacrilege,” he added.
