GURUGRAM: The municipal corporation has decided to crack down on shop owners encroaching upon or leasing out spaces in front of their outlets in a bid to free up driveways and reduce snarls in market places.

  officials said erring shop owners would be issued two challans and if they still failed to remove encroachment(s), their outlets would be sealed. The decision comes after a meet of civic councillors chaired by mayor   on Thursday. Senior deputy mayor Pramila Kablana was also present.
 
 “The increasing number of encroachments in market areas have been causing regular traffic congestion and inconveniencing common people. Besides, they (encroachments) also pose safety hazards by hindering easy movement, especially in case of emergency. Hence, it is important that strict action be taken against them,” the mayor added.
 
 Residents have been complaining about the problem of encroachments in markets. In most cases, shop owners have extended their structures and encroached upon free spaces in front of their outlets. Some of them have even rented out spaces illegally to vendors.
 
 The councillors also proposed that consultants working with MCG should make suggestions with regard to plans or anything else before tenders are opened for projects to save time. These apart, the councillors pitched for reconstitution of the medical board to ascertain the age of senior citizens, who seek pension scheme benefits but do not have proper documents.
