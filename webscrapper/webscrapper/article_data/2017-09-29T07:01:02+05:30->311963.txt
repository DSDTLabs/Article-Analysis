PATNA: Senior Bihar Regimental Centre ( ) officers on Thursday suspected a conspiracy behind the murder and suicide of two  , whose bodies were recovered from a rented accommodation at Judges’ Colony under the   police station area on Monday.

 The deceased included lance havildar Santosh Kumar Singh and constable Rinkesh Kumar Singh. According to preliminary investigation, Santosh murdered Rinkesh and then shot self using a civilian rifle.
 
 “It is not an open-and-shut case as police claim. The duo were well trained and mentally tough to handle situations in which a civilian could give up,” a senior   officer said, suspecting presence of a third person at the place of occurrence.
 
 Another Army officer denied any dispute between Santosh and Rinkesh. Rinkesh’s sister Pinky Kumar, who was also present at BRC on Thursday, demanded justice for her brother.
 
 However, City SP (west) Ravindra Kumar dismissed claims of foul play. “Our investigation so far makes it clear that Santosh killed Rinkesh, whom he had been pressurising to marry one of his maternal cousins,” he said.
 
 “Things will become clearer after postmortem and forensic reports come,” Kumar said.
