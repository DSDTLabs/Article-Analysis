VIJAYAWADA: Dealing a blow to Vijayawada police's plan to move the   against acquittal of Satyam Babu in the   murder case, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday directed AP police to reinvestigate the case. 

 "There will be a reinvestigation in the  . However, it is difficult to reopen it immediately due to technical issues. We will talk to legal experts before re-investigating the case," DGP N Sambasiva Rao said. A decision is yet to be taken on initiating a departmental action on the investigating officers who botched up the probe in the case.
 
 Sources said the government is also mulling over asking Ayesha's mother Shamshad Begum to file a writ plea in the high court seeking a CBI probe. 
 
 "But all this will move forward only after the government takes a legal opinion," sources said. Sources said the issue cropped up when the DGP met the CM during a discussion on IPS transfers on Wednesday.
 
 The sources said the chief minister was firm on reopening the case and nailing the real culprits, which should gladden the victim's parents. 
 
 Though senior police officials tried to persuade Naidu for an appeal in the apex court, he is believed to have said that framing an innocent in the case was unacceptable and that police should probe the case afresh. In fact, the DGP made the official announcement of reopening the case while commissioning an   interceptor boat C-423 at Nellore.
 
 Ayesha Meera was found murdered in the bathroom of a ladies hostel at Ibrahimpatnam on December 27, 2007.
