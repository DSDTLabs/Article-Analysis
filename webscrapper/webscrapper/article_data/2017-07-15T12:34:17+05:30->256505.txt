JALANDHAR: Various   have taken a dig at the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee's announcement about collecting details of Sikhs killed in fake encounters in Punjab during the 1980s and 90s and working to get justice for their families. 

 A joint press statement issued on Friday by   (KMO) propaganda secretary Parveen Kumar, Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) deputy chairman   and   (HRJSC) president Darshan Singh alleged, "In 1997, when   became the chief minister, he asked the human rights organizations to forget the fake encounter cases and then got the   led by Justice Kuldeep Singh, formed to hear cases of rights violations, sabotaged. People are now also aware of secret meetings between Badal and the then DGP K P S Gill and for the 15 years Badal was in power, there was no action against police officers."
 
 They said after Badal came to power, he appointed former DGP (prisons) Izhar Alam and appointed Sumedh Saini as Punjab DGP, and for a long time suppressed investigation report regarding elimination of former Akal Takht jathedar Gurdev Singh Kaonke. 
 
 "The last Badal government did not take any action when former inspector Gurmit Pinky made sensational disclosures about fake encounters or when former cop Satwant Singh Manak gave out details of several fake police encounters," they said.
 
 "For all these years SAD (Badal) leaders remained silent on the issue and now they are trying to fool the Sikhs once again," the organizations said.
