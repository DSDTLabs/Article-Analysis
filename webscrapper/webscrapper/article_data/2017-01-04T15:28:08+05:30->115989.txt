While we blame Bollywood for seeking 'inspiration' from the west, the fact is that even Indian Television has a history of copying things from international shows and films. One such example, in the recent times, is that of the show Y.A.R.O Ka Tashan.
 
  According to the recent track, Y.A.R.O. has now decided to use his abilities for the betterment of mankind, and turned into a super hero. Since he needed a costume for the same, the makers gave him something similar to the one worn by Cyclops and hoped that no one would notice what they did. Fans of Marvel comics, however, will recognize the costume at a glance.
  
  Cyclops is a part of the X-men and is a very important character in the Marvel universe. Cyclops has had a number of costumes over the years and Y.A.R.O's costume looks like a mix and match of those. Even the colors of Y.A.R.O's costume are the same as seen in the classic Cyclops suit.

  What really gives it away is the mask that Y.A.R.O's costume has. It looks exactly like Cyclops's visor. While Cyclops's visor helped him channel his laser beam, Y.A.R.O's mask merely hides his identity.
  
  With so much talent available in our country, why do we still have to be 'Inspired' from international content?!
