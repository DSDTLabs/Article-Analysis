We had reported earlier that actor   has turned lyricist with director Sunil Mysooru’s Orchestra. Here’s something else that makes this Raghu Dixit’s production unique. Not only is the entire movie shot in   — it took three years to shoot the film there — but the cast and crew is also from the city. Such is the significance of the   in   that Sunil says it is a character in the movie.

 
 
 Telling us more about his project, Sunil says, “The film is based on the orchestra culture in Mysuru, and it is during  ,   and   that they are the most active. There are things about the atmosphere then that you simply cannot recreate — you have to be there and experience it. So, we had to wait for a year each time to get candid reactions of people. That is why we shot the film over three years during the festivals. Needless to say, it was not a regular film shoot, because we had to shoot in an uncontrolled and live atmosphere.”
 
 
 
 Shooting the climax of the film was also quite an event. Shot last weekend at the Mysuru open-air theatre, close to 35 musicians (all from Mysuru) performed together on one stage for around 12,000 people, who all watched the performance live. Raghu and his band also performed at the free concert. “I directed the climax song of Orchestra, in which 12,000 people of Mysuru ‘acted’. I told the audience that nothing comes free in life, so they had to act in my film (laughs). They were excited. I was hiding behind the drum kit and gave instructions to the audience about when to stand and wave, when to pull out their phones and shine the torch, when to clap along, and when to cheer loudly. There were spontaneous reactions from the audience as well — when the song took off on crescendo — so they were clapping without me prodding them to do so. The audience was very obliging and kind-hearted, so we had to shoot it only twice. Even if we had paid junior actors, they wouldn’t have done it as sincerely,” says Raghu.
