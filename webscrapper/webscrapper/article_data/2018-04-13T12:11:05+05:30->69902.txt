VADODARA: The income tax (IT) department is delving deep into the account books of Amit Bhatnagar’s   (DPIL) after it found anomalies in the figures. 

 IT officials, who continued their search at DPIL properties for the third day, claimed that the numbers given in account books are fudged to show more turnover. The IT teams also found nine bank lockers owned by DPIL promoters who are accused of fraud and cheating a consortium of banks of Rs 2,654 crores. 
 
 “There are several anomalies in the accounts. Prima facie it seems that the turnover figures given by the promoters are not correct. The money was just circulated from one company to other company to show more turnover. We are still scanning their all records,” said an IT official. The search is expected to end on Friday after which IT officials will prepare a final report. 
 
 On Tuesday, the IT departmetn team had carried out searches at 17 locations in and around the city after the enforcement directorate (ED) conducted raids on the properties owned by DIPL and its promoters. DPIL, its managing director  , joint MD   and founder   have been booked by the CBI for cheating various banks to the tune of Rs 2,654 crores by falsification of records, creation of false documents and forgery of records.
 
 The central probe agency had searched the corporate office of the company and residences of its directors in the city last week. 
 
 The Vadodara central excise officials too had arrested Amit Bhatnagar in 2015 for evading excise duty worth Rs 42 crore. The company was accused of showing purchases on paper to get excise benefits but it never actually made the purchases.
