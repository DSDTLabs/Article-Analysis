NAVI MUMBAI: Indicating high levels of water pollution in the region, an effluent treatment plant at   has been rated as the worst-performing among 25 such units in the state. The plant, which services the Thane industrial belt, has been pumping out untreated waste into   creek. 

 Given its environmental impact, the state pollution board had last year sought remedial action by the industries wing. However, there has been no improvement in its capacity or maintenance.
 
 Effluents in the water are way beyond prescribed limits. According to a report by MPCB, the toxic chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent released by the plant should be 250mg/l; however it is far in excess at 2,128 mg/l. The biological oxygen demand (BOD) is 1,100 mg/l, but it should be 30 mg/l. COD and BOD denote level of pollution (that cannot be oxidized biologically) in a sample of water. If these rise, oxygen levels in water dip, hurting flora and fauna.
 
 The plant can treat effluents with 2,600 mg/l COD but it gets 6,960 mg/l COD, leading to an overload. “The oxidation process for treatment using micro-organisms is rendered ineffective when there is an overload. The aerator, a crucial link in the treatment, too is not working,” said a source. 
 
 Units are also accused of not treating waste before sending them to the plant. For instance, fishery units have been releasing fish scales that affected the aerator. In Taloja, around 50% of the 980-odd units are involved in chemicals , said president of Taloja Industry Association Satish Shetty.
 
 Arvind Mhatre, a corporator in Panvel civic body, has moved the green tribunal to seek relief for damage to   and Ghot rivers due to the plant. “Hearing is on March 13,” he said. MIDC was told to take over all CETPs including seven in the Mumbai region. MIDC is yet to appoint a firm to improve their working.
