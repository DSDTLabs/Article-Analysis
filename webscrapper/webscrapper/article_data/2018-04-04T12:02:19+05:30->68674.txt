SHIMLA:   on Tuesday withdrew the controversial   (Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Bill 2015, passed during previous   regime amid protests by Opposition members. 

 Forest minister Gobind Singh Thakur had moved the proposal to withdraw the bill, which the Congress members opposed and raised the point of order on the ground that no reason was given for withdrawal. 
 
 When speaker Dr Rajiv Bindal made it clear that permission was granted as per the rules, there were noisy scenes in the House. Opposition members raised slogans and even thumped their tables.
 
 Congress’s Kinnaur MLA Jagat Singh Negi said rules stipulate that reason for withdrawing the bill be given, but no legislator was informed about it. Shimla rural MLA (Congress) Vikramaditya Singh said the bill passed by previous government was to regulate sports organizations and to bring transparency. He said that there were also provisions to keep sports away from politics. He said that the way BJP government had made the move to withdraw the bill showed that it wanted to provide relief only to a particular sports association. 
 
 He also raised the issue of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) converting itself into a company and again into society and of land allotted to it for construction of stadiums. 
 
 BJP’s Nurpur MLA Rakesh Pathania countered the Opposition, saying they were only talking about HPCA while the truth was that the matter was are pending in court. He said through Indian Premier League matches, Dharamshala had got a major boost in the tourism sector. He said that good recommendations of previous bill should be incorporated in new bill.
 
 Minister Gobind Singh Thakur said that under the garb of sports bill, opposition only discussed the HPCA.
