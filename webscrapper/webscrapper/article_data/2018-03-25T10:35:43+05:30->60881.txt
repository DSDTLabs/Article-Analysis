SALEM: The first direct flight from   to Chennai will be flagged off on Sunday. Union minister of state for finance and shipping  , chief minister  , civil aviation secretary R N Choubay and other dignitaries would attend the inaugural function at the Salem airport, which had been lying unused after Kingfisher airlines stopped service in 2011.

 The first Trujet flight, operated by Hyderabad-based Turbo Megha Airways, would start its service from Chennai on Sunday at 9.50am and land at Salem airport at 10.40am. The ATR 72-600 aircraft would then take off from Salem at 11am and reach Chennai at 11.50am.
 
 “The flight will be operated under the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) of UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagarik). The total passenger capacity of the aircraft will be 70,” said Senthil Raja, head (commercial), Trujet.
 
 Talking to TOI, he said Salem district has a good passenger potential. “Based on the passenger traffic, we will operate more aircrafts to major cities, including Mumbai and Hyderabad,” he said.
 
 Trujet, Senthil Raja added, has already placed order for seven new flights to connect to all other major cities and also for international connection.
 
 Passengers have, however, sought change in timings. President of Salem District Small Scale and Tiny Industries Association K Mariappan said Trujet should consider operating the flight in a way that takes off from Chennai at 7am and from Salem at 8.30am. “We have also requested Trujet to operate flight to Tirupathi from Salem,” he said.
 
 Senthil Raja said steps would be taken shortly to change the flight timings.
