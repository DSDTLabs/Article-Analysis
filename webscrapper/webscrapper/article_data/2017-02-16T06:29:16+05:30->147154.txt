The accident that happened in March last year claimed over 100 lives and left over 350 injured.

 The witnesses heard the announcement expressing gratitude to Peethambara Kurup before the competitive fireworks started, the affidavit said. The announcement was to control the public and the spectators and the announcer extended thanks to the former MP, the court was told.
 Police officers, who heard the announcement, were on patrol duty. One of the witnesses placed the time of the announcement at 9.30pm. The witnesses, who gave statement regarding the announcement, include residents near the temple.

In view of the contradictory statements, veracity of the statements have to be verified through a detailed probe, the court was told.
