PANAJI: Member of the   (AIMPLB)   has taken a strong objection to the central government’s initiative to have a   across the country.

 “The government has waged a civil war in the country in the name of Uniform Civil Code. There is so much diversity in the country and the civil code will hamper national integrity,”   said, adding that the move is a case of aping the West where the social system is already collapsing.
 
 Saying that the misuse of triple talaq is un-Islamic, Ateeq defended that conveying it through social media is fine. “It is okay and allowed. It gives equal power to the woman also to convey her decision through the medium,” Ateeq said, adding that before banning a socio-religious norm like triple talaq, the state should also ban ‘unhealthy’ practices like extra-marital affairs, live-in and homosexual relationships.
