NEW DELHIDelhi Congress chief Ajay Makenfear of   among traders. 

  said due to the laxity of the municipal corporations and the governments, the sealing drive was destroying the livelihoods of people.
 
 Maken was the minister of state for urban development when in 2006 a sealing drive had been ordered by Supreme Court to check the misuse of residential properties. Both   and Delhi had Congress governments. 
 
 “It is very strange that private markets are knocking the doors of courts whereas the AAP government and BJP corporations are observing strikes. In 2006, when the sword of sealing was hanging over the traders, the central government led by Congress approached the court and enacted a law and made amendments in Master Plan Delhi 2021,” Maken said. 
 
 On Thursday, he gave a visual presentation at the Speaker Hall, Constitution Club, in the presence of representatives of traders’ associations. 
 
 “Clarify the anomalies, increase the floor area ratio for local shopping complexes, de-seal the basements and other premises immediately, amend MPD 2021 if required and ensure status quo in special areas till a re-development plan is made,” Maken said. 
 
 Congress would be writing to Union minister Hardeep Puri, LG Anil Baijal and CM Arvind Kejriwal on this. 
 
 Maken next quoted a notification dated June 2007 on conversion charge and said since it hasn’t been amended, so the rates remain. Maken also said that the idea behind the regulation was that the charges would be collected through installments over not more than 10 years. “Hence, these charges cannot go on forever,” Maken said.
 
 AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj attacked Maken: “ He (Maken) left many loopholes in the master plan that are being used to carry out the sealing exercise.”
 
 Maken shot back: “It was notified in February 2007, subsequent amendments through public participation were made in 2007 and 2008 to remove flaws. SC wound up the monitoring panel in 2012.”
