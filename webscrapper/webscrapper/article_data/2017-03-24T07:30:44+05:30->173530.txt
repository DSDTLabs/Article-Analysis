GUWAHATI: Chief minister   on Thursday took the   to task for its lackadaisical attitude towards protecting  , the world's largest inhabited river island, from large-scale erosion. 

 At a meeting in New Delhi with chairman of the board, Sanjay Kundu, Sonowal said the absence of board officials on the field has badly affected the anti-erosion and flood protection works carried out in Majuli, the chief minister's office said.
 
 "Referring to the unpromising past record of the board, the CM said the people of Assam - especially those from Majuli - are dissatisfied with the functioning of the Brahmaputra Board. He urged the board to ensure quality of work to shed the negative image that has come to be associated with it," the CMO added.
 
 Unless a permanent office of the board is set up in Majuli, a sense of alienation among the people will always prevail, Sonowal said. The chief minister represents Majuli in the assembly.
 
 He asked the board to set up a permanent complex - housing an office, a godown and a guest house for officials to stay in - at Majuli and execute their work. In addition, he has sought employment for local youth in the complex and proper aerial survey of the island.
 
 The lack of high-quality construction material and good contractors affects construction projects in the state, Sonowal said, advising the board to engage only the best for carrying out world-class construction work.
 
 The board, set up under the Union water resource ministry, has been working to protect the island from flood and erosion since 2004. Majuli has been witnessing large-scale erosion and floods since 1950, when an earthquake, measuring 8.6 on the Richter scale, changed the course of the Brahmaputra.
