Maharashtra government's   would bring cheer to fishermen of Mumbai. A recent study has revealed that their trawls net more non-biodegradable marine debris than  . According to the national study conducted by Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), marine debris netted by fishermen is the highest in Mumbai and the lowest in Vizag.

 The relative percentage of debris over the fish catch was 2.23% in Mumbai and Kochi, while off Vizag coast it was 0.33%. The study was conducted in September 2017. 
 
 The one-month study measured debris found by trawler nets based on the distance travelled by fishing boats. According to the study, 49.11 kg/km2 of debris was netted off Mumbai coast, compared to 2.25 kg/km2 off the Vizag coast.
 
 Rajesh Mangela, secretary of  , a fishermen's association, said, "There is definitely a lot of plastic debris that we find in our fishing nets and this has been the case for several years now. This affects our livelihood because it requires extra effort to remove it and affects marine life too. We have raised this issue with the government, but in vain."
 
 What's worrying is fishing grounds along the entire western coast report high levels in the mean weight of non-biodegradable marine debris. This is attributed to the higher level of development, industrial work and tourism activities along the west coast than on the east. 
 
 Dr V Kripa of CMFRI-Kochi, said the turbidity of water in the region was also a factor. "The sea in the west is more turbid, which means the debris thrown into the water gets settled in the sea bed. When the trawls throw the net deep into the sea, it brings up along with it all the debris that has got settled there," she said.
