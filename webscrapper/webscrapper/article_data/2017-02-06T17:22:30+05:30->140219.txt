MADURAI: A section of   villagers petitioned   district collector K Veera Raghava Rao on Monday that ruling   party is trying to   the   event, scheduled to be held on February 10, and sought his intervention. 

 They said that jallikattu is associated with village festival and rituals, but the ruling party was not involving all sections of villagers to take part in the conduct of the event.
 
 The villagers, who visited the collector office, said AIADMK men erected the ‘mukoorthakal’ (a sacred pole for the event) on Sunday morning without inviting all of them. 
 
 They said prayers should be offered to village deities. 
 
 Jallikattu became reality because people from all walks of lives, including students, staged pitched protests across the state to enable its conduct. 
 
 “Jallikattu should be conducted by the village committee with harmony but ruling party tries to project it as their function,” said R Govindaraj, vice-chairman of village committee.
