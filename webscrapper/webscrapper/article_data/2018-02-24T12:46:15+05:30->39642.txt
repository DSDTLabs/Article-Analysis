JAIPUR: The lawmakers had some amusing conversations in House on ‘evil spirits’ or ghosts haunting the assembly on Friday. During Zero Hour, parliamentary affairs minister   requested Speaker   to wrap up the House debates before midnight as the ‘evil spirits’ would get active after that.

 “Some members have even requested the gau palan (cow) minister to perform rituals here. It scared all,” Rathore said, as the House bursts into laughter.
 
 Government chief whip Kalu Lal   said, “A committee should be constituted to find out if there are ghosts here or not.”
 
 Rathore said, Gurjar knows how to handle ghosts.
 
 Joining the chit-chat, Speaker Meghwal said, “We should sometimes have discussions on ghosts too. For centuries there has been suspense and thrill over whether they exist or nor. I also have some knowledge on the subject.”
 
 Congress MLA Sharwan   demanded, “First tell the house what does the expression ‘Popa bai ka raj” mean?” Gurjar quipped, “If the ghost of ‘Popa bai’ catches you, no one will be able to save you.” 
 
 Outside the house, Devsthan minister Rajkumar Rinva said ghosts do exist. “People with ‘kamjor-gan’ and ‘vayu-dosh’ see ghosts,” Rinwa said.
