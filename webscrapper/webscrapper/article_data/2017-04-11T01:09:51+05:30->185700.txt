Mumbai: The   on Monday said the   and civic body must ensure ‘strict’ implementation of   and   for monsoon so that citizens are not stranded. 

 The court’s oral instruction came even as the India Meteorological Department said this week, it will take possession of the Jogeshwari reservoir site from   for installation of the second Doppler weather radar.
 
 To HC’s query, additional solicitor general Anil Singh replied that the court has been informed earlier that the installation and commissioning will take at least two years. The bench then said the authorities must focus on temporary measures like taking precautions. “Traffic and other things must be implemented. Tell them to be strict on these. Meanwhile, what is possible must be done...like announcements. Instead of getting stranded somewhere, people should know,” said the bench that was hearing a public interest litigation by advocate Atal Dubey seeking corrective steps after the 2015 deluge brought Mumbai to a halt.
 
 Advocate S C Naidu, representing Dubey, drew the court’s attention to its various directions for commissioning of stormwater pumping stations to resolve flooding. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for BMC, said work on five of the eight stations is completed. “One will be commissioned by June,” he added. The next hearing is on June 13.
