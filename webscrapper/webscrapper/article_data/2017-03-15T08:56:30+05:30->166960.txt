 and her fiancé recently got cupping therapy done and shared a picture of their backs on Instagram. A worried  , who is a close friend to Sofia was perturbed on seeing marks on their back and quickly asked Sofia what was wrong with them.
 
  Sofia posted the picture and wrote, "We just got back from a major cupping session!!!! Feeling very sleepy now. Tension in the shoulders and back has gone." Without realising even one bit about what it meant, Rakhi hurriedly replied, "Oh my god what's wrong what is that Sofia."
  
  
  
  As soon as the social media world saw her comment, they started mocking her, and few even went ahead explaining her what those marks meant.
  
  Sofia is drooling over her fiancé, and the sexy item girl turned nun and now back to being her normal self, she has been posing pictures of them on Instagram ever since they got engaged.
  
  
 
  
  She seems to have found her true love and is all set to exchange vows with him. In yet another post of the two, she wrote, "I cannot wait for our sacred union and blessings in front of all of our friends. We will be blessed in the Temple of Awakening.. our religion is Peace and Love, all religions are Peace and Love. Islam, and that encompasses the All."
  
  
  
  Sofia had created uproar earlier, when she declared herself a nun, giving up on all worldly pleasures. Former Bigg Bos contestant, Sofia was back to being her sexy self in no time when her Bollywood film Six-X released last year. By landing into one controversy or the other, she has managed to keep herself in the public eye.
  
  The news of her engagement came as a shocker to many, as she had once said that she has given up on sex, marriage and children.
