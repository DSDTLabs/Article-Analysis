When you do what you love, you never seem to work. As we are a professional organisation – my responsibilities are to steer the company into the future, which involves very limited day-to-day operational intervention. The team which leads individual businesses is quite capable and empowered to run the show. That leaves me with enough time.

 
  Seeing and interacting with youngsters gives me a high. They are so full of thoughts, dreams and energy. They know exactly what they want, and I derive happiness by our thought exchange.
 
 
 Fail fast and fail first.
 
 
 Collective mediocracy is better than individual brilliance.
 
 
 Procrastination. 
 
 
  Don’t think too much for things you have to do, and don’t do things which you have to think too much for. You have one life, live it today.
 
 
  Success is a collective outcome of unheard/unseen but relentless failures. You can’t succeed if you are not willing to fail. 
 
  
  I live life as it comes. Don’t think, don’t procrastinate, push your level best without worrying about the outcome – the rest follows.
