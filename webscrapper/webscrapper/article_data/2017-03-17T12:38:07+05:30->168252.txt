RAJKOT: Authorities of   in Rajkot, have asked parents of 62 girls from   studying there, to seek   for their wards. 

 These girls were identified by the school management itself in 2014-15 from different parts of the city for enrolment in kindergarten (KG). They were educated free of cost. However, on Wednesday, the   told the parents to find another institute for them from the next academic year as they were unable to provide free education to these girls.
 
 According to   Reform, the school while enrolling the 62 girls had assured parents free education up to class XII.
 
 “The school management had gone from door-to-door in various parts of the city to identify poor and needy girls to be enrolled at the KG level. However, now the school management has informed parents that the school will no longer provide free education to the girls and they should find an alternative on their own,” said Postariya.
 
 Baffled by the schools decision, parents have sought government’s intervention. They on Thursday met the district collector and gave a memorandum.
 
 When contacted, Rajkot collector Vikrant Pandey said that he has received the representation and he has assured parents that administration will find solution to the problem.
 
 “We will make alternate arrangements for these kids in other private schools. We have talked to some of the schools and they have agreed to provide admission to these kids,” Pandey said, adding that he will seek answers from SNK School authorities over its abrupt decision.
