HYDERABAD: City police have registered six dowry   over the past one month.

 In 2016, Hyderabad police registered 20 dowry death cases, while in 2017, it logged 25 cases. “Last year, we received nearly 2,000 cases of domestic violence, of which 15% are due to dowry harassment. These days even educated and economically-sound people are involved in such cases,” assistant commissioner of police, SHE Teams, D Kavitha said.
 
 Last month, a newly-wed woman committed suicide at her house at   after being harassed by in-laws for additional dowry.
 
 According to a women’s right activist, such cases were rampant with marriages turning into a business.
 
 “Now, people have rate cards for grooms based on their educational background and job. If the groom is an engineer, ₹2 lakh dowry is demanded and if he is working abroad, then the dowry is over ₹10 lakh. Even poor families save for dowry. People demand and accept dowry despite it being illegal,”  , founder of Shaheen Women's Resource and Welfare Association, said. According to police, several cases of dowry harassment go unreported as many women fear going against their in-laws and society.
 
 “We can say that the cases seem to be increasing. With awareness increasing, more women are lodging complaints and speaking out,” ACP Kavitha added.
 
 Activists said that though the groom's family are held responsible, fault also lies with the bride’s family. “The bride’s family should not get their daughter married to someone who demands dowry. If they keep fulfilling their demands, then the demands will only increase. People’s mindset needs to change. We get nearly 100 cases of domestic violence, of which 80% are related to dowry,”   added.
