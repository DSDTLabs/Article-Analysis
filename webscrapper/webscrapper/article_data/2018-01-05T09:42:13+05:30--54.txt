MADURAI: The   bench of the Madras high court sought the appearance of Karur district collector, superintendent of police and land survey assistant director in a case which sought the removal of encroachments, including alleged  , from a temple land in Karur.

 The division bench headed by justice N Kirubakaran gave this direction on Thursday on a batch of cases filed by one A   from Chennai. 
 
 The petitioner said the government in 1998 decided to build the district collector office in   village by acquiring 16.36 hectares of the land belonging to Thanthoni Arulmigu Kalyana Venkataramana Swamy temple and a piece of private land. 
 
 The district administration had adopted due procedure in acquiring private lands, but failed to follow procedure in acquiring the temple land.
 
 The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) department opposed the administrationâ€™s action and sent a letter on January 29, 2014 to the district collector seeking compensation for the land taken. But, the collector did not consider it.
 
 On October 23, 2017 the HR&CE sought Rs1.97 crore as compensation for the land. But, no compensation was assigned. Also, this amount was not fixed as per the provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the petitioner said.
 
 The district administration has been enjoying the temple land for 15 years without giving any money to the temple authority, which was illegal. 
 
 The act of the administration was nothing but encroachment of the temple land. Besides, there are other encroachments made by third parties. The HR&CE commissioner is supposed to remove encroachments, but had failed to do so. 
 
 Hence, it was a must to direct the government to remove encroachments including the collectorate, the petitioner said.
