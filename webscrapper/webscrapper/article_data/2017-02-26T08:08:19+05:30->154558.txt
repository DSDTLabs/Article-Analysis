 Vijayan, who laid the foundation stone for the new office complex of a Kannada daily, exhorted the   to protect the country’s  , and to be the voice of the poor and downtrodden. “Communal forces are attempting to destroy India’s secular fabric. Many media outlets that claim to be secular, stick to a communal stance. This is a dangerous trend, and should change,” added Vijayan.
 
 The   said that he found nothing wrong with media outlets adopting a stance on issues, as long as they worked towards the protection of India’s pluralistic ethos. “Also, media should embrace progressive thoughts, and show concern for the poor,” he said.
 
 Lamenting how majority of the media houses protected capitalists, Vijayan said, “Most media organisations across the world are run by multinational capitalist establishments. Very few outlets are exceptions. The situation is no different in India as well. The media’s duty is to be with the nation, and the people.”
 
 Karnataka minister for forest B Ramanath Rai, UT Khader, minister for food and civil supplies, Mangaluru City South MLA JR Lobo, Mangaluru City North MLA BA Mohiuddin Bava, Moodbidri MLA K Abhaychandra Jain and the chief editor of the daily, Abdussalam Puthige were among the others in attendance at the ceremony.
