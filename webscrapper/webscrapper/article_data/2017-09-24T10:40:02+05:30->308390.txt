RANCHI:   (HEC) Ranchi on Saturday said all retired employees' pending dues will be cleared before Dussehra on September 30. "Due to a financial crunch,   has not been able to clear leave encashment amounts worth Rs 49 crore to its superannuating employees for the past six years. All 1,900 HEC employees, who have retired between 2011 and March 31, 2017, will be paid their leave encashment amounts by Dussehra," Avijeet Ghosh, HEC chairman-cum-managing director told TOI. He added, "Gratuity payments to retired employees have already been cleared. HEC is now paying the leave encashment amounts to its retired employees." As per the decision taken by the Union cabinet on March 31, 2017, HEC will receive Rs 743 crore from the state government for the 656 acres of land in Dhurwa that has been transferred to the urban development ministry for the smart city project.

 The land has already been transferred and HEC has started to receive payments from the state government for the same.
 
 The total of Rs 49 crore on account of leave encashment will be paid from the amount received from the state government. “The union department of heavy industries too has stipulated that proceeds received from the state government should be utilised to first clear off all pending dues to retired HEC employees,” Ghosh said.
