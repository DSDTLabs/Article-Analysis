For  , a student of   who hails from Israel, it’s the people who are more intriguing than the city. “I did explore the city — went to Charminar and other tourist hotsopts. The city is beautiful, no doubt, but I find the people more interesting. I find more pleasure in talking to people than sight-seeing,” says Mika, who is here on the ‘Student in India Programme’(SIP). Which is why she chose to take up Telugu classes along with her regular classes of Political Science. “Not every person talks in Hindi or English. I won’t be able to communicate with everyone if I don’t know the local language. Moreover as an SIP student, I want to understand my surroundings and know its culture deeply. This I can do only if I talk to the city folk, apart from doing my own research on India’s history and politics. I don’t want to miss anything during my short stay here,” she says. 
Interestingly, apart from people it’s the students’ politics that interests here. “The environment here is charged up. Election fever is in full swing. I am curious how it will turn out to be,” she says, adding, “Though I am not qualified to participate in the elections being an SIP student, I try to attend every political event in the campus.” 
 A student of   of USA, Mika, finds the teaching methods different in here. “The experience is good. The professors are knowledgeable, thoughtful and obliging. But I found that the professors don’t assign as much reading here like they do in Wesleyan. So I sit in the library and do a lot of reading myself,” she says.
