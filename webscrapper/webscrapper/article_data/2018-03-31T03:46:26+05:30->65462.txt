MUMBAI: A day after an audio clip purportedly containing a conversation between MLA   and a   engineer in which the former abuses and threatens the official went viral, the   legislator has approached police chief   claiming that he perceives a threat to himself and his family. 

 In the letter sent to Padsalgikar on March 30, Satam wrote: "I would like you to investigate the matter and bring the facts out so that any attempt to malign anyone in future won't take place. I would also like to place on record that the person concerned may go to the extent of stopping me from pursuing the matter...I perceive a threat from them. I request you to take adequate measures regarding the same." Satam has been criticised by politicians and bureaucrats alike. City Congress chief   said Satam should not have spoken in this manner. The Congress is likely to raise the issue in the civic standing committee meeting on Saturday.
