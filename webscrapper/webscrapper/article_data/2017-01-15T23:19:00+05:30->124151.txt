 Shamita Rao and Renita Lobo, who received the education award, said that it was a long journey which was a successful one. “This is our 18th year since we started with LKG and UKG, which later continued till SSLC. We did not want students to go away, so we started PUC. In fact, it was challenging as young women to get all the work done and students have been the motivation. We always wanted to build a bridge between rural and urban education,” they said.
