 The move comes amid continued trading of barbs between the two state leaders.
 
 “We have decided to fight the elections with Yeddyurappa as our CM candidate. The entire party has accepted this,” said Shah.
 
 Shah, who held a late night dinner to set aside any differences between the two prominent state leaders of the BJP from  , tried to project the “big brother” image by taking centrestage.
 
 The two leaders have been engaging in public tiffs and venting their anger against each other over the last few years
 
 Sources say the midnight unity show was to convey that the central leadership was aware of the issues plaguing the state.
 
 While the dinner diplomacy was scheduled to be only between Shah, Eshwarappa and Yeddyurappa, there was also a noteworthy presence of RSS national organisational secretary BL Santosh at the dinner meet.
 
 Santosh has also been a target of Yeddyurappa’s barbs in the past.
 
 Later, at the press meet, Shah attacked chief minister   and said the latter was running away from all the issues plaguing the state including the failing law and order situation .
 
 “Instead, the Siddaramaiah government is trying to foster divide and rule policy by creating rift within the communities and religions,” he said.
