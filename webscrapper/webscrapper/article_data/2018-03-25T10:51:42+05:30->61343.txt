NEW DELHI: On Saturday, Australia captain   admitted that his team was involved in ball-tampering during the third day of their third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. Giving details of their plan to generate reverse swing, Smith revealed they used a sticky tape to pick up hard granules from the pitch and then use it to rub the ball.

 
 
 The act of rubbing the ball was caught by the TV cameras with Australian   putting the yellow tape inside his pocket after rubbing it against the ball. He was later filmed hiding the aforementioned foreign object inside his pants after realising his act had been captured. 
 
 The incident drew widespread condemnation from all around with calls of Smith to step down from team captaincy.
