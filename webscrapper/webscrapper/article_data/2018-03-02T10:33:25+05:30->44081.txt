TRICHY: The   on Thursday launched its 24th microcompost centre in the city at   near KK Nagar falling under ward number 38. This is part of the civic body’s efforts to decentralise the collection and segregation of domestic and commercial waste.

 According to the corporation, the new yard was established at an estimated cost of Rs 57 lakh sprawling over 6,000sqft. Through this facility, at least 7,500 households will be ensured with door-to-door waste collection through five mini load vehicles everyday. “So far, waste collected from the ward was heading to another micro-compost centre near Trichy airport. With the new facility, we can segregate and process the waste within the ward by cutting down the fuel cost involved,” an official with Ponmalai zone of the civic body said. 
 
 To prevent domestic waste reaching the corporation’s 47 acre dumpyard in   each day, the civic body commenced the decentralisation of solid waste collection and disposal by establishing a microcompost centre in Pookollai near   in August, 2016.
 
 Through the decentralisation drive, the corporation thus far in the past 1.5 years has established a total of 24 microcompost centres that are segregating biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes collected each day, through which compost is manufactured from degradable wastes while non-biodegradable waste is sold to scrap dealers.
