NEW DELHI:  , Italian manufacturer of confectionery and chocolate products, is looking to invest around Rs 2,000 crore in India over three years to make India a hub for developing products with higher melting points, which it can then export to countries with tropical climates similar to India’s.

 
 The company, which sells Nutella,  , Kinder and Tic Tac, may also introduce ice cream in India, as it has formed a joint venture with FMCG conglomerate   to make the product in Europe under its Kinder brand. Unilever sells ice-cream under the Wall’s brand in India. Ferrero, a privately held company, which recently acquired Swiss food giant Nestle’s candy business in the US for around $2.8 billion, will double its distribution to 10 lakh outlets. It has invested around Rs 1,500 crore in India since 2007 and raked in revenues of around Rs 1,000 crore last year.
 
 “We could easily double sales of Ferrero Rocher chocolates in India but we prefer modern trade over momand-pop stores because of lack of robust cold chains,” Stefano Pelle, MD at Ferrero Rocher India told TOI. “Unfortunately, modern trade is not well-developed in India and this is a limitation.”
 
 Ferrero is in the process of developing more products for India, among which, some would have higher melting points than Ferrero Rocher chocolates and would be difficult to imitate by other players.
 
 “Our Ferrero Rocher chocolates should be ideally be consumed at 22-25 degrees, at 30 degrees those melt,” he said. “Products that fall in the tropical portfolio can have a tolerance of up to 32-35 degrees, which I still think is low for a country like India.”
 
 The know-how for the new products are coming from Ferrero’s R&D labs across the world, including the one it operates in Baramati, Maharashtra. It also operates a factory at the same location.
