Bhubaneswar: The BJP and Congress on Saturday took potshots at the state government for slipping to 18th position from the earlier 16th in the latest health index published by NITI Aayog recently. The parties said the state has performed poorly in neonatal mortality and low-birth weight of newborns. 

  president   said the state government makes tall claims by coming up with some policies or guidelines in the health sector. But it failed to implement those in letter and spirit, he added. "It is unfortunate that the state can't perform well in health indices even after 18 years of the BJD government. The NITI Aayog report proves the government's failure on the health front," said Harichandan. 
 
 BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said performance of the state is not satisfactory in bringing down the neo-natal mortality rate or low birth weight of newborns and improvement in immunisation coverage or access of HIV patients to anti-retro viral therapy. "If the health index falls from 16th to 18th rank, it shows the state government has not brought about any significant development in the health sector between 2014-15 and 2015-16," he said. 
 
 "We have been hearing about the death of children from   in   and delivery of babies by pregnant women on road or near hospital due to lack of ambulance service or medical bed," said Mohanty. 
 
 He said   episode exposed the state's helplessness. "We have been raising health issues many times but the state government does not pay heed to our demands," he added. 
 
 BJD spokesperson   said the BJP and Congress are bringing political allegations against the state government. "They don't want to know the real picture of development. Centre has praised the state for polio vaccination and other health measures taken by our government. We are in the process of coming up with several new initiatives in the health sector," he added.
