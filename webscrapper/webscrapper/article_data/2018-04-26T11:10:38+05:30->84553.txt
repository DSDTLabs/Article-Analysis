PANAJI: Based on a petition filed by   and the Goa Foundation, a division bench of the high court of Bombay at Goa has issued a notice to the Corporation of the City of   (CCP) and to the New Shalom Residents Association, Miramar, for restricting access to a public park located by the side of the housing society.

 A division bench consisting of Justice N M Jamdar and Justice   issued the order.
 
 The petitioner alleged that in the past several weeks, the association has taken effective steps to enclose the public park, which includes a children’s play section, and turn it into a private leisure area exclusively for its members.
 
 The association has erected a green metal fence that carries its name as well as a permanent gate that ensures that members of the public are dissuaded from entering and enjoying the facilities at the park. People have also complained that the security staff hired by the association attempts to dissuade those who wander into the park.
 
 The role of the CCP has come under criticism for enabling the society, through a post-facto resolution, to carry out works on the park, including the structures for permanent enclosure, which exclusively benefit the members of the society.
 
 The petitioners have pleaded with the high court to direct the CCP to open up the park by demolishing the gate as well as taking down the association’s name from the green metal fence. They also want the corporation to erect a board at the gate announcing that the park to everyone.
