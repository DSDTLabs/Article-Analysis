PANAJI: The directorate of education has reduced the number of working days for primary, secondary and higher secondary schools, for the academic year 2018-19, by 14. The number of instructional days, however, will remain the same at 200.

 In its academic schedule for the year, the directorate has reduced the number of working days for schools from 234 in 2017-18 to 220 for 2018-19. Chief minister  , during his previous stint in office as education minister, had hiked the number of working days for schools to ‘discipline’ them.
 
 Minimum working days are to be completed by the school staff and have no direct implications for the students. The holiday schedule for Goa’s schools was revised in 2013 after the state was repeatedly pulled up by the Union human resource development ministry for not being able to complete the mandatory number of working and instructional days prescribed for schools.
 
 But, over the last few years, the number of working days that were upped in 2013 have been steadily reduced back to the pre-2013 minimum requirement of 220.
 
 
 
 
 There is no change in the number of minimum instructional days though. “Total instructional days shall not be less than 200 during the academic year 2018-19,” the DoE circular reads. School instructional hours also remain the same at five-and-a-half a day.
 
 As per the Right to Education ( ) Act, schools have to put in minimum 200 working days at the primary level and 220 working days at the upper primary level.
 
 According to the 2015-16 data of the Union human resource development ministry’s   wing, almost 50% upper primary schools in Goa could not meet the 220 working day requirement.
 
 At the primary level, though, nearly all the state’s schools could achieve the prescribed minimum of 200 working days.
 
 In the case of instructional days, Goa has shown huge improvement since 2013, completing more than the required number at an average of 225 days at the primary level and 216 at the upper primary level.
