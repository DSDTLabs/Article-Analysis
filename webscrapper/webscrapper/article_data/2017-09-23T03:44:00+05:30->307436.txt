Panaji: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) inked 29 agreements with different Goan companies to locally manufacture processed food products ranging from idli mix and snacks to packaged beverages and energy bars. 60 other Goan companies have also voiced their interest in visiting DRDO’s Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) at Mysuru. The agreements were signed at the recently concluded two-day industry conclave on food technologies organized by the Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) in collaboration with DRDO and the directorate of industries, trade and commerce.  “The price for transfer of technology is quite low. DRDO has also given some relaxations for Goa. Usually a special team is sent which inspects the local industry before the agreement is signed. Here GSIA was given powers to certify if the unit was fit,” Verna industrial estate association president and GSIA member Damodar Kochkar said. A day earlier, chief minister Manohar Parrikar had encouraged entrepreneurs to use DRDO’s technology to setup up food processing industries in the state. Parrikar said that the state government would subsidize the royalty paid by entrepreneurs. “You can pay the royalty and take the certificate that you can use the technology. The fees (for the technology) can then be repaid to the entrepreneur to a large extent,” Parrikar said. He said that those who intend to venture into self-employment can setup their industry units by availing of various government schemes and by also using produce sourced from Goa and nearby areas like Hubbali, Mysuru, Sawantwadi and Belagavi. Three Goan entrepreneurs - Aniruddh Dhempe from Goa Paints, Rajkumar Kamat from EP Group and Shekhar Sardessai, of Kineco Kaman - had already benefited from the transfer programme.
