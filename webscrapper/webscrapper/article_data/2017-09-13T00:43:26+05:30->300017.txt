MUMBAI: After the   disposed of Abu Salem’s plea to be moved to a jail in UP stating this and other applications were “infructous,” he has now written to DG prisons, IG prisons and the superintendent of Taloja jail, citing his good behaviour and the fact he has family in UP. 

 He also submitted he has no enemies in UP. He earlier told the court he did not feel safe in local prisons. Salem was recently convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts. 
 
 Salem in his plea said there have been no adverse complaints against him. He further stated the trial court had granted various facilities and relief including home food, table fan, dumb bells for exercise and he not misused any of these. “I am a permanent resident of Azamgarh in UP where in all my family members and relatives reside, hence I will be highly obliged if allowed a transfer to a jail in UP. It will easy and convenient for my family members to come and meet me and even to co-ordinate with me regarding my legal matters. Understand my plight that none of my relatives come for my jail ‘mulaqat’ as they all stay in UP,” he said.
