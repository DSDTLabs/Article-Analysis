THANJAVUR: Around 300 students from the Kunthavai Naacchiyar  ,  , staged a protest on the college campus on Saturday, alleging there was misappropriation of funds in installing   cameras at the college. Reportedly, around 64 CCTV cameras – including eight in the hostel – were installed recently.

 The students claimed that the condition of toilets in the hostel was very poor and that they had to attend nature’s call in the open. They said that since CCTV cameras were set up in those areas too, it intruded their privacy.
 
 Funds were collected from the students by the college administration for installing cameras in the campus after a resolution was passed during a   ( ) meet.
 
 A senior official from the college administration stated that the institution decided to use a certain amount of the money from the hostel fund for installing CCTV cameras.
 
  “A lot of parents were missing during the PTA meet and they didn’t know about the CCTV installation and hence we faced financial shortage. But we took money from the hostel fund only after speaking to the students,” he claimed.
 
 The senior official also added that many hostel residents had complained about the poor condition of toilets over the last couple of days. 
 
 “They also requested us to remove CCTV cameras from certain spots since they go to those places to answer the nature’s call,” he said.
 
 The official also said that he has asked the students to go home for a week's time so that the administration could resolve the toilet problem within that period.
