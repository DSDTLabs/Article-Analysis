Amritsar: Artistes from Costa Rica gave a scintillating performance during the 7th Amritsar International Folk Festival held at Khalsa College of Education (KCE) here on Saturday. It was a fusion of Caribbean dances with Punjabi folk as culture and music of both places blended on the occasion.

 The organizers called it the fusion of ‘cultures of the two worlds’ as the group Inspiracious Costa Rriceaces came on the stage to give rare and magical performances. The festival was organized by the Punjab Cultural Promotion Council (PCPC) in collaboration with the KCE and the Khalsa College Charitable Society (KCCS). The Costa Rican artistes in colourful native dresses regaled the audience as they also shook legs to bhangra and giddha performed by college students. They performed enthusiastically and won the hearts of the audience with their foot-tapping dances and melodious singing. They said their songs were a manifestation of their celebration of life, farm produce and daily chores. The 16-member group was headed by Petter Chinchilla. 
 
 On the occasion, KCCS secretary Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina described the festival as an opportunity of two distant land artistes to come together on one platform for international friendship through art and music. He said the world was emerging as one village and such interaction forged understandings between diverse cultures.
