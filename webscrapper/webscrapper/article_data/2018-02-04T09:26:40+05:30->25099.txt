NEW DELHI: Two days after the murder of  , west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar remained tense on Saturday amid heavy police and   to prevent the incident assuming communal dimensions. While political groups sought to gain attention by meeting the bereaved family, the rumour mill was busy churning out various versions of Thursday’s killing of Saxena by the family of the woman he wanted to marry.

 The atmosphere at RBG Flats, where Saxena resided with his father, a heart patient, and mother, was sombre on the day as friends and relatives gathered to demand justice. The victim’s family emphasised that the incident was a result of a fight between the two families, not a communal feud. There is a plan to hold a candle light march to protest the murder most likely on Monday.
 
 “This incident is being given a communal colour. This is not correct,” said Duggal, Saxena’s cousin. “Our only demand right now is punishment under law to whoever was responsible for the murder. If any help is needed at the moment, it is to ensure that Ankit’s parents are provided a source of income because he was the sole breadwinner.” 
 
 With some groups making provocative statements following the 23-year-old’s murder, security has been beefed up with the deployment CRPF, BSF and CISF around the houses of both the victim and the accused. Delhi Police officers of DCP rank regularly patrolled the streets on Saturday. Large gatherings outside the police station and in the locality have also been banned.
 
 The family said that Bajrang Dal representatives had met them. Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari also came visiting and described the murder as organised crime. “A communal angle shouldn't be given to organised crime,” he said, adding, “I request the authorities to provide Ankit’s parents with Rs 1 crore as compensation.”
