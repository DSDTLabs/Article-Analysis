Karthik refuses to listen to Revathy and says that marriage is not a joke. In between, some unknown person informs   about the marriage discussion that's taking place between Karthik and Revathy.

 Jeeva is angry and rushes to the spot, where Revathy and Karthik are talking about marriage.
 
 
 Revathy replies, they should lead a life together in front of people, who want to separate them. Revathy says, if Karthik does not marry her she will commit suicide.
 
 Karthik slowly gets convinced and thinks about marriage. Revathy gives the thaali to Karthik to marry her. In the meantime, Jeeva reaches the temple.
 
 
 Karthik is misunderstood by Azhagar too. Azhagar thrashes Karthik and asks that in spite of knowing that Revathy would get married to Jeeva, how could he take such a step. Azhagar says, even if Karthik marries Revathy, he would kill Karthik and go to jail.
 
 Revathy, who was forcing Karthik to marry her for so long, does not defend him.
