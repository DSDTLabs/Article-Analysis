PANAJI: As the summer season peaks, water levels in the state’s five major reservoirs have dropped.

 In the case of three reservoirs,  , Amthane and  , the water levels on Thursday were recorded at below 40% of their full capacity.

 “Water levels in the reservoirs are closely monitored during the summer and the flow of water for irrigation is controlled. As of now, there is no restriction on supply for irrigation. Even if the monsoon is delayed, there is a plan in place,” said a water resources official. “Even if the water levels drop alarmingly low, we have a dead storage available with us in reserve, which is released,” the official said.
 
 Currently, the Anjunem dam is filled to 28% of its capacity, while water levels at Selaulim and Amthane stand at 37% and 36%, respectively, as of Thursday.
 
 Located in Sattari taluka, Anjunem is Goa’s biggest reservoir and relies on a tributary of the   for its water source.
 
 The Amthane dam, located in Bardez, is the state’s second largest reservoir. It supplies water for irrigation as well as raw water supply to the Assonora water treatment plant.
 
 The Selaulim reservoir, in Sanguem taluka, caters to the drinking water needs of towns and cities including Margao, Vasco, Quepem, and Sanguem, as well as the   hinterland.
 
 In Panchwadi, Ponda, the reservoir supplies water to nearby villages while the Chapoli reservoir supplies potable water to residents of Canacona.
 
 Goa’s reservoirs reach their peak around September, towards the end of the monsoon season. They are at their lowest levels from   till June, just before the monsoons arrive in Goa. Around this time, the water resources department closely monitors the release of raw water to maintain the water levels within healthy limits.
