PANAJI: The bias some members of the state police hold against victims of   who are not native to Goa is one of the major hurdles faced while rehabilitating the latter,   of NGO ARZ said on Saturday at Difficult Dialogue, an international conference.

 He cited an incident wherein the victim, who had been trapped in the flesh trade, was rendered suicidal after the local police revealed her identity in the village where her family was settled in, in Goa. Investigation was needed to check if the rescued girl — hailing from   — was vulnerable and at risk of being trafficked again. A task force, which is part of the woman and child welfare department, was requested to assess the situation. The force, however, passed the request to the local IG who sent it to the SP and finally, a beat officer was sent. “The officer went to the sarpanch of the village where the girl’s family was staying and asked for her details after saying that she had been caught in a prostitution case,” said Pandey. When the girl returned to her family, she called the NGO back to say she and her family have been left suicidal as her identity had been exposed by the investigation.
 
 “We’ve worked with good and bad police officers. One of the first things police here say is ‘Why did you come here? You are spoiling Goa.’ We need to understand a girl is never exploited in her own village or city, she is trafficked,” said Pandey, speaking in a panel discussion on trafficking and vulnerability.
 
 “Trafficking victims are termed so only because it is mandated by the law, but they are not treated as victims,” Pandey rued. “We lock them in protective home as we believe she is a danger to society and will spoil it. Then she is produced before the SDM or the child welfare committee depending on her age. We take her for hearings in open vans and produce her in open court in presence of other offenders are there. There is no protection. In fact, we are making her more vulnerable.”
