GURGAON: A 30-year-old man on Thursday surrendered before the police and confessed to hacking his   to death with an axe a month ago, for allegedly sexually assaulting his wife. 

 He told them he had hidden the   body parts for over a month, in a trunk at a room the latter had rented, and decided to confess only on his father’s insistence. 
 
 TOI is withholding the names of both victim and accused because it involves a sexual assault charge.
 
 The accused — a businessman and a resident of Jind — told police he killed his 35-year-old brother-in-law on December 23 in a fit of rage, and left for Nepal with his wife and daughter.
 
 The deceased was married to the accused’s younger sister. According to the FIR filed at Sector 29 police station, in December 2016, the accused had called his wife to join him from Jind in Gurgaon. However, he was in Noida and could not reach to meet her that day. He told police his brother-in-law, who had rented a room in Chakkarpur six months ago, offered to help and took his wife to his rented room. A few days later, his wife confessed to him that his brother-in-law had raped her at the time. When he confronted his brother-in-law, he was blackmailed with his wife’s objectionable pictures.
 
 A few days later, when the accused was in Bengaluru, his brother-in-law again called his wife and his one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, on the promise he would take them both to Bengaluru. He took them to his apartment in Gurgaon and allegedly sexually assaulted the accused’s wife.
 
 When the accused returned to Gurgaon on December 18, his relatives told him his wife and daughter were with his brother-in-law. On December 23, he killed his brother-in-law, after the latter allegedly stripped his wife in the accused’s presence.
