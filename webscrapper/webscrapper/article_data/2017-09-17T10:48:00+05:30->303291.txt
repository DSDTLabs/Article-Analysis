HYDERABAD: The Central government has given `338 crore administrative sanction for construction of 1.4 km long   at the high traffic density Che Number Junction to   corridor, which is part of National Highway 202.

 It will be a four-lane flyover with service roads on either sides and is expected to provide much-needed relief to the motorists from daily traffic jams.
 
 The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation had identified the properties to be affected a few years ago and had also issued notices. But later it had dropped the proposal to construct a flyover keeping in view the huge finances required for the project. Now, with the roads and buildings department getting the all-important nod, a notification for land acquisition would be issued and the project is likely to be transferred to the municipal administration department. “It is going to be a chal lenge for the traffic police too who have to plan alternate routes to divert the traffic during the construction of the flyover. As it is, it's a congested corridor. It may take at least one-and-a-half year for the fly over to be thrown open to the public as land acquisition is yet to be done,“ said an official.
 
 The project cost includes `229 crore towards 4.62 acres land acquisition. The construction of the flyover alone is estimated to cost `111.71 crore.The flyover will start from SB Church at Golnaka and cover Che No. Junction and Sriramana Talkies junction and land beyond the Amberpet market.
 
 Roads and buildings minister   Nageswara Rao said they have also submitted proposals seeking central funding for the   (SRDP) estimated to cost nearly `17,000 crore.
 
 Admitting that the road space is less in Hyderabad compared to other metros, Tummala said the government has planned flyovers, elevated corridors and SRDP--all vehicular traffic congestion easing projects and submitted proposals seeking central funding.
