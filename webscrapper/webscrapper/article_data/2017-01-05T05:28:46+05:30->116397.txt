MUMBAI: The anti-corruption bureau of the CBI on Friday arrested I-T officer   and CA   for demanding Rs10 lakh from a yoga instructor,  , to settle I-T returns assessment.Both were released on bail on Wednesday.

 Kumar was allegedly pressuring Kodwani's family members to pay a bribe but they refused, stating that they had followed all rules. The family filed a corruption case against   with the CBI. The CBI convinced the family to continue their negotiation with Kumar as it would help them to catch him red handed.
 
 Gupta, who was the Kodwani family's CA, had told them last month that Kumar was seeking the money to settle Karuna's assessment for financial year 201415. Karuna's parents met Kumar last week when he allegedly told them to pay the bribe.   told Kodwani that Kumar had threatened to raise unwanted queries and would order for tax penalty if they failed to fulfil his demand. The CBI laid a trap and allegedly arrested Kumar and Gupta while accepting Rs 50,000.
