Coimbatore: Nature enthusiasts should be chosen as people’s representatives, said actor Mansoor Ali Khan on Thursday. He said natural resources were being plundered across the nation and only if nature enthusiasts were made people’s representatives, the resources could be saved. He was in Salem to view the Kumaragiri lake in Ammapet and Mookaneri in Kannankurichi which were desilted and had been made into bird sanctuaries. Khan congratulated the volunteers of Salem Makkal Kuzhu who had worked for the initiative. Also, Khan, along with his family, joined the volunteers who were involved in removing water hyacinth from Kumaragiri lake.  Later, while speaking to reporters, he said the Centre was being partial in water sharing between states. He said several lakes in the state were dry, and added that if every citizen spends one Rupee, the lakes can be restored. If lakes are restored Cauvery would be flowing now, he said. Khan said sewage flows into the Kumaragiri lake in Salem and added that this could be prevented if the underground drainage scheme is hastened. Khan added that the police had not yet arrested an actor who had shared a derogatory post on women journalists, but they had arrested people who had gone to meet Bharathiraja and Seeman at the protest for Cauvery. The state government has been misguiding the police force, he said. He also said while the prices of petrol and diesel were low in other countries, in India the prices were being hiked very day.
