BATHINDA:   (KVM) of Jaito, a   NGO dedicated to promote   for the last few years, has opposed the use of genetically modified (GM) mustard under its programme ‘India for safe food.’ KVM executive director Umendra Dutt said they would hold a public protest on May 19 at Sector 17, Chandigarh against the GM mustard.

 “GM mustard is expected to be approved by the Union environment ministry in the next few days. It is potentially harmful for human health, environment, and is against the welfare of the farmers. Due to these concerns, we have decided to air our voice against it,” said Dutt.
 
 In a press release on Wednesday, Dutt said the GM crops like mustard have an adverse impact on health. He said its impacts on soil health were well documented. “In a country like India where large number of women workers earn their livelihood by manual weeding of weeds, GM crops will be harmful for them and may displace them from their livelihood opportunities. GM crops also mean greater chemical residues in consumers’ food.” 
 
 He said political activist Professor Manjit Singh, a retired sociology professor of Panjab University, Chandigarh, organic farmers led by Gautam Singh and health and social activist Pyare Lal Garg have lent their support to the protest.
