HYDERABAD: The government plans workshops in Telangana Minority Residential Education Institutes Society’s schools from next year to help students distinguish legitimate activism from extremist activism, said AK Khan, adviser,   (MWD), at the   meet on Thursday.

 The meet was organised by   as part of bilateral engagements in the city and Islamic research seminary Al Mahadul Aali, Al Islami. It marked the end of workshops held to empower Muslim youth during Sept and Oct, 2016. 
 
 Khan raised concerns over lack of awareness among youth of Constitution and Islamic jurisprudence. He sought more such workshops in educational institutions to help youth recognize and reject extremist ideology. The idea was backed by MWD secretary Syed Omar Jaleel.
 
 Andrew Mc Allister, British deputy high commissioner, Hyderabad, emphasized on how extremists attract youth on social media. “Social media is used as a tool to infuse anger. There’s a need to overcome this through such workshops,” he said.
