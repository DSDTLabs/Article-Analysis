PORVORIM: Town and country planning minister Vijai   said in the   on Monday that Regional Plan 2030 (RP 2030) will be ready in six months and that it will be based on the transfer of development rights (TDR) plan. The TCP minister said that under TDR land owners will be given incentives not to convert eco-sensitive land. 

 The new RP, which will be in operation till 2030, “would be conceptualized by taking the House into confidence”, Sardesai replied to a question jointly tabled by opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar and Curtorim   Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.
 
 Kavlekar said that since being elected MLA, he has heard only discussions and debates on the RP and deadlines fixed and missed. 
 
 Vested with developmental rights, Sardesai said, “Land holders will be given incentives to protect eco-sensitive, agriculture, or khazan land under RP 2030.”
 
 He said, “RP 2021 is a closed chapter now, the government will not discuss it further but commitments made in it will be honoured.” 
 
 Sardesai said that until the new RP is notified urgent cases will be decided by the town and country planning board, including government projects.
 
 The opposition alleged that approvals were even given for projects located in hilly areas. Congress   Francisco Silveira was more categorical in his criticism over inordinate delays in finalizing the RP. 
 
 “They were cleared while you were in the ruling,” said Sardesai as St Andre MLA tried to make his point. 
 
 Sardessai told the House that as many as 1,700 projects were cleared after RP 2021 was notified in October 2011. RP 2021 was kept in abeyance in June 2012. Within a few months the BJP-led government had come to power in March 2012.
