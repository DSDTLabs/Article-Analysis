CHENNAI: Founded in 1992, in memory of a mother and son who died in the Mumbai air crash of 1976, the   College of  , on the outskirts of Chennai, will celebrate 25 years of its existence on Saturday. 

 When   and her son Arunachalam died, their legal heirs endowed the entire wealth of the deceased to the trust. “Every year we take in around 50 students,” says principal Kanchana Khan. There are now 180 undergraduates in the college, eight postgraduate students and 17 following their doctorates.
 
 Three years after the college was established, the trust began operating a community health centre at Arakambakkam. “This initiative was undertaken to offer experience to our student nurses, but now the centre provides health care to around 20,000 people who live in the 18 surrounding villages,” says Khan, who adds that treatment at the centre is free though there is a registration fee of Rs 2. “Our nurses visit homes in the villages we have adopted. We found a high incidence of diabetes and hypertension. Our students are doing research on the prevailing physical and mental health conditions here,” she adds.
 
 Khan says when studies done by the college students show the need for assistance of any kind, the staff at the community centre follow it up. 
 
 “For instance, after a study by one of our PhD scholars we have set in motion a de-addiction motivational clinic for alcohol and tobacco addicts,” she says, adding the college also has a research arm in collaboration with the University of Saskatchewan in Canada called the International Centre for Collaborative Research.
