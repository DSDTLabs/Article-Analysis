RAJKOT: Police are suspecting   in the   whose   was found in Navagam village of   on Sunday morning. 

 Some locals saw the burning body and immediately informed the police. “The incident appears to have occurred on Saturday night. Considering the fact that vermilion, rice and some withered flowers were found sprinkled around the body, we suspect it to be a case of human sacrifice in a tantrik ritual,” said Bamanbor police . 
 
 JJ Chauhan, investigating officer, said there was a picture of Vasram Bapu near the body. “We are awaiting the forensic post-mortem report of the body to ascertain whether the man was burnt alive or after he died. For now, we are investigating the case as a murder but we don’t rule out some tantric rituals in the case and probing this angle too. Usually, coconuts, red cloth and grains are found near the bodies during tantrik rituals.” 
 
 Police are yet to ascertain the identity of the deceased.
