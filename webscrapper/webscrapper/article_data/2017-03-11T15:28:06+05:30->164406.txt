NEW DELHI: AAP chief   said he's "disappointed and will introspect" about AAP's poor performance in Punjab, where the Congress has won the state with at least 59 seats. AAP is leading in a mere 22 seats. 

 The Delhi CM also said he accepts the people's verdict and thanks all AAP's workers. "The struggle is on," he tweeted.
 
 
  
  
 
 AAP leader   waxed poetic about the loss in Punjab and the poor showing in Goa. The party has not yet won a seat in Goa and even its chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes is trailing. An approximate translation of a Hindi poem he tweeted goes as follows: 
 
 "This loss is just a pause,
  life is a struggle,
  in victory and in loss,
  there's no trouble
 On the path of thorns
 We are correct, they, too, are reliable"
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Vishwas, too, thanked AAP volunteers for "fighting a good fight" and congratulated the Congress for winning Punjab. He also congratulated the  , which is neck and neck with the Congress in Goa and which has swept Uttar Pradesh.
