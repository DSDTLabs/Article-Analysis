KOLHAPUR: Chillar Party — a children activity-based film club in the city — is organising a two-day   at   from February 15. The interesting part of the festival, according to organisers, is participation of the underprivileged kids.

 “The kids from corporation and ZP schools, along with the ones from orphanage and ashrams will be given preference in the second edition of the fest,” said the organisers. Last year, over 2,500 students from schools across Kolhapur got a chance to witness the world of cinema.
 
 Milind Yadav, founder of the film club, said at present they screen a popular children’s film on every fourth Sunday of the month and the response received has been quite good. He added, “We want to ensure, children from the underprivileged section too get a chance to witness the world of cinema.”
 
 Yadav said first edition of the film festival saw participation of around 20 schools. “We have already spoken with few schools in the city and invited them to be the part of this event that is free of cost. Students from Avani NGO and few corporation schools have confirmed their participation,” he said.
