 At the IPHB, Bambolim, women patients interviewed expressed dissatisfaction with overcrowding, lack of outdoor activities and reading materials, absence of adequate functional bathrooms, not being permitted to take personal health care decisions, and not being explained their rights and side effects of medicines. The presence of bedbugs, cockroaches and mosquitoes also figured on the complaint list.
 
 A major relief was the staff’s attitude towards them, which they felt was impartial, though some admitted to being threatened and verbally abused. None reported physical abuse. 
 
 “All patients rated the facilities for medication and treatment as good or very good,” the report states and adds that the major grumble was that the side-effects of medications administered were not explained.
 
 A majority stated they weren’t allowed to make health care decisions where even their hair was cut without their consent. Informed consent was not taken prior to starting treatment and nearly three-fourths reported no pre-testing   and other tests. 
 
 Patients were also kept in the dark about their rights. 
 
 “Although the IPHB was the first to develop a  , all the patients said they had not been given information about their rights. Two-thirds felt that confidentiality was not maintained. Eleven patients (44%) said they had not been educated about their illness,” the study states.
 
 All those interviewed said they were provided with basic toiletries. Most were also provided with footwear, but were upset at not being permitted to wear their own clothes or be provided with a choice of hospital clothes.
