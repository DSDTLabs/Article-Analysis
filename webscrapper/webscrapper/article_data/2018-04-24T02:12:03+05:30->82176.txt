 “The incident of crop burning is not a problem in Delhi. It is further submitted that no such incidence was reported by any of the district magistrates of NCT Delhi. Accordingly as of date there appears to be no requirement for framing of any policy in regard,” the government said in an affidavit.
 
 The   further informed a bench headed by acting chairperson Justice Jawad Rahim that their development department was keeping a track of the situation by issuing advisories to district magistrates to ensure crop burning did not take place in the capital.
 
 “In case of any fire incident — after learning about the cause of the same — appropriate policy or guidelines will be framed without delay in future,” the submission added.
 
 Based on the submission, NGT has now directed the   (DPCC) to verify the data and submit their findings within a week.
 
 The green panel said it would consider the plea filed by the government, which sought an exemption of the fine of Rs 2 lakh which was imposed on it for not filing an action plan on crop residue. NGT said the decision will be taken once DPCC submits its data.
 
 The tribunal had earlier directed Delhi and   states to submit an action plan in regards to crop burning. The tribunal had also rapped the Punjab government for failing to provide incentives to farmers.
