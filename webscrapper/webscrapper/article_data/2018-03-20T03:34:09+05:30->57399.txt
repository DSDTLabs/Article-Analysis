NEW DELHI: After   leader   hosted a dinner for opposition parties last week, NCP chief   has now invited the same parties for a similar do at his residence here on March 27, where   chief   will be present. The West Bengal chief minister could not attend Sonia’s dinner but had deputed party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay.

 
 Trinamool, Left parties, SP, BSP, DMK and RJD were among 19 parties represented at Sonia’s dinner where Congress president Rahul Gandhi was also present. All eyes are on whether Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP, which has just quit the BJP-led NDA, turns up for Pawar’s dinner.
 
 Banerjee met Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhara Rao in Hyderabad on Monday amid talk of a non-BJP, non-Congress formation taking shape. She has also backed Congress’s   for a Rajya Sabha seat from West Bengal.
 
 With the Parliament session entering its third week of deadlock, opposition parties are busy exploring alliance options to take on the BJP in the 2019 general elections. The coming together of sworn enemies SP and BSP for the Lok Sabha bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur and their success in besting the BJP has enthused opposition ranks.
 
 Most of the opposition parties have also supported no-confidence motions against the government brought by YSR Congress and TDP. However, the motions are yet to be taken up.
