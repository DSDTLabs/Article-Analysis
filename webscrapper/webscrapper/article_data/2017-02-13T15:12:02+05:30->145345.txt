NEW DELHI: The world’s number one Test team has extended its unbeaten home streak to 20 matches in a row, with victory by 208 runs over   on Monday, and is one win away from breaking the existing Indian record of most unbeaten Tests at home. 

 Should Virat Kohli’s team beat or draw with Australia in the first of four matches starting February 23, it will go past the current mark of 20 Tests on home soil without defeat, set between 1977 and 1980. 
 
 From January 28, 1977 to February 3, 1980, teams led by Bishan Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath stitched together an unbeaten run of 20 Test matches against England (two), West Indies (six), Australia (six) and Pakistan (six). 
 
  
  
 Since December 2012, when the final Test against England ended in a draw, India have not lost a match on home soil. Under MS Dhoni, India beat Australia 4-0and West Indies 2-0 in 2013 and now under Kohli, this team has beaten South Africa 3-0, New Zealand 3-0, England 4-0 and now Bangladesh in this one-off Test in Hyderabad.
 
 The Indian cricket team last lost a Test in August 2015, to Sri Lanka in Galle by 63 runs, which is 19 matches ago. Still, they are some way short of the record for most consecutive Test matches without defeat, the 27 of West Indies between 1982 and 1984. India also have to win another four Test series to equal the nine straight wins of England between 1884 and 1892 and Australia from 2005 to 2008. Australia will visit for four Tests starting February 23 in Pune.
