RAIPUR: At least 29   and were admitted to hospital on Tuesday after they   at a   in Sukma district. 

 On Wednesday, ABVP workers protested outside the school alleging food poisoning due to poor quality of food served.
 
 Meanwhile, the district administration has denied the girls fell ill because of food poisoning saying that the chemical pesticides used in the vegetables served, which they claimed were not washed properly, might have led to stomach ache and vomiting among the students.
 
 The tribal girls from Class 1 to 5, residing at the Birla government hostel in Maoist-hot Konta block of Sukma district. were served rice, dal, potatoes and cabbage in their morning meal.
 
 Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Pradeep Kumar Baidh said that initially around eight to ten students complained of stomach ache and were rushed to hospital.
 
 "As they just had their meals, we assumed they fell sick due to the food. As a preventive measure few more students were brought to the hospital who later complained of stomach ache and were provided treatment. As they felt better by the evening they were discharged on Tuesday night," the SDM said.
 
 The students were then provided dinner at a different hostel, Baidh added. However, 16 more girls complained of abdominal pain and were readmitted to hospital.
