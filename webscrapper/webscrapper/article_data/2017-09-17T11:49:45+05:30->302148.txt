CHENNAI: BJP national executive member H Raja lost the election to the post of chief of the   unit of   and Guides by a massive margin on Saturday. He was defeated by former director of school education, P  , in the poll held at the state headquarters of Bharat Scouts and Guides on Kamarajar Salai.

 Returning officer Kalavathi told reporters that of the 286 registered votes, Mani polled 232 votes, while Raja polled 52. Two votes were invalid.
 
 Last week, DMK working president M K Stalin alleged that the AIADMK government was supporting Raja's nomination, and that it was an attempt by the BJP to “saffronise” the TN Scouts and Guides. In a   post on Saturday, Stalin congratulated Mani and said the “future of children is in safe hands.”
 
 Earlier in the day, Raja alleged that the election was “illegal” and read out an e-mail purportedly sent on Friday by the national headquarters (NH) instructing the state unit “not to conduct the proposed election on 16.09.17 till further orders from the chief national commissioner.” 
 
 Kalavathi told reporters that the e-mail from NH “came at 9.55 am on Saturday” just before polling began. She said the poll was valid and that they had kept NH informed about developments. “They instructed us to hold the election before September 30 and approved the schedule. There is no rule that we have to conduct the poll only with their approval,” she said.
