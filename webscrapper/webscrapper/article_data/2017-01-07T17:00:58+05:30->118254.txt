PANAJI: As part of an initiative to diversify Goa’s economy and to simultaneously improve skill development,   on Saturday vouched to develop Goa into an education hub if it wins the February 4 state assembly elections. Releasing its vision document for the coming 2017 state assembly elections, the party put educational tourism on priority.

 “We have to open up our doors to make Goa an education hub. This is our priority. You will ask me where the money will come from but let me say that there can be no compromise on education,” Faleiro said while speaking to the press at his office.
 
 To enhance Goa’s education profile, the party wants to bifurcate Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development into Goa Institute of Public Administration and Goa Institute of Rural development. 
 
 “Goa Institution of Public Administration must collaborate with Goa Institute of Management to offer post graduate courses in public policy and management. It must offer technical and non-technical courses,” Faleiro said as he unveiled the party’s vision document.
