NAGPUR:   (SEC) has decided not to hold the elections for   (ZP) and   (PSs) in the district due to a stay imposed by Nagpur bench of  . The elections to ZPs and PSs of Buldhana, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Amravati districts will be held in two phases.

 A division bench of justices BR Gavai and VM Deshpande on December 15, 2016, had stayed the conduct of ZP and PS election in the district while hearing the petition filed by Congress leader Baba Ashtankar against upgradation of Parseoni gram panchayat as a nagar panchayat. Ashtankar had contended that upgradation of status of Parseoni village with less than six months remaining for ZP and PS election was illegal.
 
 Some months ago the state government had upgraded the status of Parseoni and Wanadongri from gram panchayat to nagar panchayat. The two small towns had become urban areas from rural areas. As ZP and PS elections cannot be held in urban areas, the two towns were excluded from jurisdiction of Nagpur ZP and respective PSs. This was objected to by Ashtankar. Former Shiv Sena MLA Ashish Jaiswal had also filed a petition in HC against the governmentâ€™s decision to upgrade the status of Parseoni but it was dismissed.
 
 The polling for ZPs and PSs in Buldhana, Yavatmal, Wardha and Chandrapur districts will be held in the first phase on February 16. The polling for these bodies in Amravati district will be held on February 21. The   will be held in both phases so that administration can effectively counter possible Naxalite threat.
