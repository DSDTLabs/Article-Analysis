Delhi Police's Special Cell on Sunday arrested the kingpin of a syndicate supplying heroin to Delhi and other parts of north India. 

 The team seized 4kg heroin worth Rs 20 crore and opium worth Rs 10 crore from a truck driver who used to deliver fruits at Azadpur Mandi.
 
 The accused, Vinay Jain (46), was also arrested in 2013 in Punjab.
 
 “Through his contacts in Manipur, Jain procured heroin and smuggled it from Myanmar border and roped in a truck driver to get the drugs to Delhi,“ said DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav. A team led by inspectors Attar Singh and Jitender Tiwari had been tracking the members of this syndicate.
 
 On September 22, police received tip-off that a key member of the cartel, Sukhwinder Singh, would come near Azadpur Mandi with a big consignment in a truck with registration number PB 10 DD 5798.
 
 A trap was laid near the Mandi and the truck was seen parked on the side. After a while, the driver started the truck and was about to flee when the police intercepted him and recovered the heroin kept in a secret cavity in the driver's cabin.
 
 The driver provided crucial information about Jain after which a team was sent to Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. On September 24, Jain was nabbed from his house and brought to Delhi for interrogation. Four SIM cards were also seized from him.
 
 Jain was earlier arrested on drug trafficking charges in 2002 and 2007 in Indore and Agra respectively. He used pay Rs one lakh to drivers for each successful trip, police added.
 
 Police are now focusing on arresting other drivers on Jain's payroll and the associates of the gang active in Delhi. 
 
 The heroin was being sold outside pubs and discos in south and southwest Delhi. A part was also bought by traffickers of African origin.
