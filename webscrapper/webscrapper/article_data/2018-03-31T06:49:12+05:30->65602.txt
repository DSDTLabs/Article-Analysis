HYDERABAD: The loss of David Warner may have come as a dampener to   fans, but the Hyderabad   Rail Limited (HMRL) has stepped in to revive their spirits by extending the timings of the metro rail service till 12.30 am on   match days in April and May. As of now, the train service ends at 10 pm.

 Besides extending the train timings, HMRL will be increasing the frequency of trains to and from the   cricket stadium in Uppal on match days. HMRL is also selling IPL match tickets at select metro stations. “Hyderabad Metro Rail extended train services till 12.30 am for IPL matches. You may buy or collect your IPL match tickets booked online from  , Moosapet, Ameerpet, Habsiguda, Nagole and Moosarambagh stations and Hyderabad Next Malls at   and Hi-Tech city,” tweeted L&T Metro Rail.
 
 HMRL managing director   said, “L&T experimented extending the timings for a recent cricket match at Uppal stadium. Now, they have come out with a special arrangement for IPL.”
 
 Referring to extension of timings and increasing frequency of trains, NVS Reddy said: “We have submitted all data and certificates to the commissioner of rail safety. From Mettuguda and Ameerpet, there is a CBTC (Communication based Train Control) technology. After the commissioner gives the safety clearance, it will become part of the system. On the Miyapur to Ameerpet corridor, we are operating one train every 8 minutes, while on the Ameerpet to Nagole corridor, the frequency of the train is one every 15 minutes.
 
 “During match days, we want to increase this frequency to one train every 8 minutes so that cricket fans can reach the stadium in time.”
 
 In other arrangements, including providing last mile connectivity to the IT corridor, the metro rail authorities have commenced a shuttle service from Monday to Friday at Ameerpet Arm-B at 8:45 am that will go upto Hi-Tech City/ Gachibowli and Wave Rock.
