MAPUSA: Tensions ran high on Monday at the government office complex at Pernem, with the deadline for filing of nominations for the assembly elections just 48 hours away, as   (BJP) and   (MGP) supporters were engaged in a battle of slogans.

 Day five saw the filing of nominations by three bigwigs from Pernem and Mandrem constituencies - chief minister and   candidate  , forest minister and BJP Pernem candidate Rajendra Arlekar, and his MGP opponent Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar. Since only five members including the candidate are allowed to enter the government office complex, their supporters were waiting outside shouting slogans. 
 
 After furnishing the formalities, Parsekar came out of the complex and pacified the supporters and instructed them to leave the site.
 
 Sources said that there were clashes reported between the supporters of Porvorim’s independent candidate Rohan Khaunte and BJP candidate Guru Pawaskar, while the party workers were engaged in door-to-door campaigning. 
 
 Rohan Khaunte, in his complaint at the Mapusa police station, alleged that Pawaskar’s supporters hurled abusive and threatening language towards him and his supporters and the situation almost got physical. Pawaskar levelled similar allegations against Khaunte.
