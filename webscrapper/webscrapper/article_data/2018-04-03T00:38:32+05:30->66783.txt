New Delhi: The   on Monday agreed to hear a plea challenging the CBSE’s decision to conduct   for   economics paper which was leaked.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra listed two PILs for hearing on April 4.
 
 One of the petitioners, Reepak Kansal, contended that there was no justification for a re-test and the students should not be punished by forcing them to sit for a fresh examination.
 
 The petitioners alleged that those students who benefited from the leak should be punished and action taken against them.
 
 “It is to be noted that this year, 16,38,428 students are appearing for the   and 11,86,306 students for Class XII in the   examinations. And therefore, to penalise the students for an incident which is under investigation and without completion of that investigation/inquiry and issuing a notice on March 28, 2018 (for re-exams), affects the fundamental rights of students which is arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional,” the petition said. tnn
