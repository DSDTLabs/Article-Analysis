They might have been paired for the first time in 'Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo Deewana', but not many know that Vivaan Shah and   have been friends since their childhood. The two young actors, who play the leads in the quirky romcom, bonded on the sets of ' ', in which their fathers —   and   — shared screen space. 

 Akshara says, “We are childhood friends. Vivaan and I used to talk about the fun moments we shared when we would attend the film’s shooting. That’s probably why it was easier for us to work together in this film.”
 
 Vivaan adds, “We were lucky to see how 'Hey Ram' (directed by Kamal Haasan) was shot. It’s one of the greatest period films. The exposure we gained on the set is something we are grateful for.”
 
 In fact, 'Laali'... marks the reunion of three people who were associated with the period drama. Akshara chips in, “Saurabh Shukla is part of both the movies. It was like a mini reunion every time we shot for our film.”
