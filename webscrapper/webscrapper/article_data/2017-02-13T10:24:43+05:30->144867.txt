SURAT: Alpesh Thakor,  ,  , has demanded   into   because top politicians from Delhi could also be involved in it. 

 “We will launch an agitation against the state government if the investigation of Naliya gang rape case is not handed over to the CBI. We also demand centre’s intervention to ensure that law and order situation in the state does not worsen any further with many gang rapes and hooch tragedies happening,” said Thakor here on Sunday. 
 
 “The investigative agencies should try to identify 50 other victims of the accused as alleged by the rape survivor,” Thakor said, adding that he has developed booth-level management teams in 68 assembly constituencies of the state. 
 
 Thakor threatened to start a movement against the industries if they failed to give 85 per cent of jobs to local youths. “We are going to launch a state-wide drive from February 23 against the industries not employing 85 per cent of local people. Our 50 teams will lock up the gates of the industries once the movement starts from TATA Nano plant in Sanand,” Thakor added.
