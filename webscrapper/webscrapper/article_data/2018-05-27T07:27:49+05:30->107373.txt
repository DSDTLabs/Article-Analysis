CHENNAI: Slum dwellers resettled at the Moorthingar Housing Scheme tenements in   were happy to take custody of their new and spacious 440sqft units a few months ago. But the happiness did not last long as water woes have plagued them ever since.

 Residents say the supply is irregular and short, with 300 litres being supplied once in two days per family which is insufficient. “We get water supply only from 8am to 9am on alternate days. It is very difficult, especially because we have western toilets that end up consuming a lot of water,” said R Kala, a resident.
 
 The 300-odd apartments were handed over to residents earlier this year by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB). “While conservancy and other amenities have been taken care of, the erratic water supply has become worrisome for every resident here,” said Asha who moved into the tenements with her husband in March.
 
 “Once this supply is over, we wait in queues to carry water from the sole hand pump to our houses. Some days, when the lifts don’t work, it is a bigger struggle,” Kala said, adding,“We pay a monthly rent and maintenance of Rs 1000. Basic amenities like water supply should be taken care of.” 
 
 An engineer from TNSCB told ToI that Metro Water has been asked to take care of the water supply. However, an area engineer from depot 46 said the water supply connection was handed over to TNSCB. “The supply and regulation have to be looked into by TNSCB. Our responsibility ended with handing over the supply connection,” he said.
