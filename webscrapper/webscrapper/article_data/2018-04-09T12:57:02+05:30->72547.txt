 "In the guise of preventing entry of protesters demanding constitution of Cauvery management board, police have cordoned off the entire stretch of Marina which is causing huge inconvenience to morning walkers. This apart, they have also restricted entry of vehicles into the beach area, resulting in such illegal parking as pointed out in the news report," Sathyanarayanan said.

 Agreeing to hear the matter, the bench asked the advocate to file a proper public interest litigation.
