VASCO: With Cortalim area facing   shortage for more than a month, the   ( ), Mormugao taluka, is working hard to ensure that all the areas under its jurisdiction are receiving adequate supply. 

 Assistant engineer (PWD) Vishwambher Bhende attributed the shortage to the numerous breakdowns, as well as the shifting of pipelines and booster pumps on account of the construction of flyovers and bridges, and this has hit the schedule of   supply in some areas.
 
 While Vasco and Mormugao constituencies get water during the night, Cortalim and Dabolim receive water during daytime. 
 
 Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha had recently threatened to launch an agitation along with villagers if water supply was not regularised. 
 
 “Due to the ongoing work on a flyover at Tari Point, Desterro, we had to take out the 100 HP booster which supplied water to the hilly areas in Sada. From mid-January, we started shutting down other valves in Mormugao constituency to continue the water supply to Sada along with Cortalim constituency. This gradually slowed down the pressure of water affecting supply in the hilly areas of Cortalim,” Bhende said. 
 
 He also said that the construction of the Zuari flyover led to the shifting and removal of many pipelines in Cortalim, adding that there have been several breakdowns as well. 
 
 “These projects are also of national importance and we will be on our toes to ensure that people don’t suffer till all these construction works are completed,” the engineer said.
