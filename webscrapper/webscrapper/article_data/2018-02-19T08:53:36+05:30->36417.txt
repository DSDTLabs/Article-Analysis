CHENNAI: Mohammed Rafi’s last-gasp equaliser helped   eke out a 1-1 draw against   at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. The stalemate delighted the 13,000-strong home fans of Chennaiyin, among whom Grandmaster   was also present.

 
 Anand, who recently won the World Rapid Chess Championship in December 2017, is a huge Real Madrid fan and was attending Chennaiyin’s match for the first time this season. The match also saw the Tamil Nadu women’s football team, which won its maiden senior national title last week, in attendance.
 
 The TN women, who scored an impressive 25 goals in the competition and defeated strong teams such as Odisha and West Bengal en route to beating Manipur in the final, soaked it all in. Nandini, the captain of the team, and Indumathi, who was the top-scorer in the tournament with 10 goals, also did a lap of honour with the trophy in front of an ecstatic home crowd.
 
 The girls also clicked selfies with their favourite players and spoke at length to some of them at the end of the match. The icing on the cake was when Chennaiyin coach   offered them some words of advice. “Don’t get complacent after the win. This is the beginning and you have a long way to go. Try to be consistent,” Gregory told the girls in an interaction after the match. It will be interesting to see whether the girls work on the advice in the future.
 
 The list of very special guests didn’t end there. Little ones from Dazzling Stone orphanage in Chennai were also at the match. They had an evening to remember, cheering and supporting their idols at Chennaiyin FC with absolute gusto.
