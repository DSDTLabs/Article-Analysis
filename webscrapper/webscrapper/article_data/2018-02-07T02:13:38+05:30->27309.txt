NEW DELHI: The   have   over   from   and   during the   in the city, as per the data provided by the civic bodies.

 The trader bodies argue that this amount should be paid back and that traders will now approach Supreme Court for this purpose.
 
 Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of   (CAIT), said that the conversion charges collected by the local bodies were meant for carrying out development work in market places including development of parking spaces.
 
 “We will move the Supreme Court next week to seek refund from the local bodies as the conversion and parking charges paid by the traders were diverted to pay salaries and pension to the employees. No development work has been carried out in market places. The local bodies had to develop parking facilities along with redeveloping the markets but nothing has been done and we want refund from the local bodies,” said Khandelwal.
 
 Slamming the local bodies, Khandelwal said that the sealing initiated by the civic bodies on the directions of the monitoring committee was baseless and illegal. CAIT had called for a two-day market bandh last week to protest against the sealing drive, which was called off after the DDA proposed changes in the master plan 2021 to provide relief to the traders.
 
 South corporation has collected Rs 282.70 crore from conversion and parking charges during the fiscal 2017-18, out of which Rs 94 crore was collected after the sealing drive was initiated from December-February. 
 
 North corporation collected Rs 98.34 crore from September 2017 to February 2018 out of which Rs 3.49 crore were collected in the month of February. 
 
 East corporation is yet to release their report on the collection of conversion and parking charges.
