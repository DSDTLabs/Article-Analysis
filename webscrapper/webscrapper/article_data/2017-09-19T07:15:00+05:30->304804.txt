Gurgaon: That the  , that stirring call to love, continues to leave audiences in raptures, despite periodic political paroxysms and social upheavals, speaks wonders of its surging (and uplifting) rhythms.

 On Wednesday, the heirs of a venerable tradition will be performing in a setting that’s a symbol of a resurgent India Inc., and a way of life that is eternities removed from that of the first qawwal who ever lent his voice to the language of love. The Nizami Brothers – Chand, Shadab and Sohrab – will be in town to perform at  . 
 
 The Bandhu are the descendants of the court singers of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, the 14th-century Sufi saint. Theirs is the Khanqahi qawwali, whose rhythm and melody originated in the Sufi shrines, or khanqahs (from the Persian for house of devotees), of the north. This is qawwali in its purest form, a way for the believer to reach his or her god.
 
 No matter how fraught the political mood, a 700-year-old tradition like the Khanqahi qawwali will find a way to the soul. “India is a large and diverse nation, so there will always be trials and tribulations, sometimes big, sometimes small. But there will always be those whose hearts are open to the Sufi qawwali – they’ll make the effort to come and listen to us,” Chand Nizami told TOI, on his way to a performance.
 
 “Wherever we go, people take time out to come and see us, to listen to us. For, the Sufi qawwali brings peace not just to mind and body, but to the soul.”
 
 Indeed, the Bandhu are only carrying on, with heart and verve, their ancestors’ calling, taking the message of love from the   of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya and showering it like rose petals. 
 
 “People say that when they listen to us, they are transported to another place,” says Chand, grateful. That is the magic of the qawwali, and may it never fade.
 
 Welcome the festive season with the Nizami Brothers, who will be performing at the amphitheatre in DLF Cyber Hub 2.0, on September 20, at 6 pm.
