  Adi is a young game designer from Lucknow who dreams of emigrating to the US and living the American dream. At a chance encounter during his friend's wedding, he meets Tara. She is a recent architecture school graduate working in an architecture firm. She dreams of going to Paris to pursue higher education. The cheerful banter soon gives way to a conversation where both Adi and Tara realize that they strongly feel that marriage isn't for them and move in together until the time they go their separate ways when career comes calling. With only 10 days left and parting imminent, Adi & Tara are forced to confront some matters of the heart.
