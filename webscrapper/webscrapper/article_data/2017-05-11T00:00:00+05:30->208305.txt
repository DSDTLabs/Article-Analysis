During her comeback phase,   has been doing only staid and mature characters, mostly upper class as well. However, in her next film, directed by Phantom Praveen, the actress will be seen playing a completely opposite character, someone who does odd jobs for a living.
Filmmaker  , who is associated with the project, tells us, “Her character Sujatha is a native of Chenkalchoola, Trivandrum. She does odd jobs in houses or part-time jobs like working for a shoe shop, from morning to evening.”
 
 Manju is a widow in the movie, and has a 15-year-old daughter. It’s her struggle to bring up the girl which forms the crux of the story. Debutante Anaswara has been cast as the daughter.
 
 Martin also adds that Manju’s character will be something like “the old Manju we all liked from her earlier days”. “This will also be the first time Manju will be playing a woman from the lower classes in her comeback. However, there won’t be any Trivandrum slang for Manju’s character, as the district has many slangs which are exaggerated often,” he says.
 
 The film would mark the debut directorial of Phantom Praveen, who had worked as Martin’s assistant. The shoot will be entirely in Trivandrum.
 “The movie will be a complete family entertainer and it is meant for homemakers,” Martin concludes.
