COIMBATORE: DMK working president   on Wednesday said a government led by either O Pannerselvam or any   nominee would not be stable and could lead to elections to the state assembly even before local body polls, that are due already. 

 Addressing party workers at a meeting in Coimbatore, Stalin said the present government headed by caretaker chief minister O   was only an interim arrangement. A government formed either by Panneerselvam, who has revolted against the party leadership, or the AIADMK would be short lived, he added. 
 
 Considering the present political situation, there was a possibility of assembly elections being held in the state even ahead of local body polls, expected in June-July, he said. Local body polls, slated to be held in October last year, were cancelled after Madras high court quashed the state election commission's notifications holding there were many irregularities in it. 
 
 DMK has ruled out support to Panneerselvam in case of a floor test in the assembly amid the accusation by   that it was behind the revolt in the AIADMK. 
 
 Panneerselvam, who has alleged he was forced to resign, and several of his supporters have been expelled from AIADMK by Sasikala in the backdrop of his revolt. AIADMK MLAs have elected minister E Palaniswami as their   party leader and he has staked claim to form the government.
