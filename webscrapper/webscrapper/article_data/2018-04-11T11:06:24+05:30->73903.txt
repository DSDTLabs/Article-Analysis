NEW DELHI: RJD leader 
    for the latter allegedly messing up his arithmetic.

 PM Modi yesterday lauded the Bihar government for constructing a whopping 8.5 lakh toilets in a week, but opposition leader   took to social media to refute the claim.
 
 Taking Modi's figure at face value, the RJD leader did some basic calculations, and concluded that such a number was possible only if 84 toilets were built per minute.
 
 He asserted that the PM's claim was just a "big goof-up".
 
  
  
 Mumbai Congress chief  , too, voiced views similar to those held by Yadav, saying it was humanly impossible to construct toilets at such a high rate.
 
  
  
 Speaking at an event in Patna to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran campaign and promote Swachh Bharat, PM Modi had on Tuesday heaped praises on Bihar chief minister   and the people of the state for their cleanliness drive.
 
 
 
 
 "In the last one week, more than 8,50,000 toilets have been constructed in Bihar. This is a great achievement. I congratulate the people, the 'Swachhagrahis' and the state government for this."
 
 The PM also presented awards to exemplary 'Swachhagrahis'. More than 20,000 'Swachhagrahis' from across India were present at the event.
