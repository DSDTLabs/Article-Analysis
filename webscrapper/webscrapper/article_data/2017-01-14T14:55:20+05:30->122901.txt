MANALI: The bodies of two National Institute of Technology (NIT) students, who had been missing since January 6, were found near the 
  in Himachal Pradesh’s   district on Friday.

 A 40-member search team and a chopper were pressed into action after the parents of Akshay Kumar and Navneet Rana informed Mandi police that the two had been missing from NIT’s Hamirpur campus. The temple is located 150km from Manali.
 
 Temperatures in the region have been hovering around -15°C for more than a week. One of the bodies found near the temple was identified as that of Akshay of Hamirpur’s Sujanpur from an Icard in a bag. The other couldn’t be identified, but officials suspect it is of Bilaspur’s Navneet. It is not known whether the students were climbing to the temple or were on their way back.
 
 Neither had informed their parents about their visit to the temple, with sources saying that they had only told a friend about their trek. After they did not show up for five days, their parents visited the NIT campus and met Janjehli subdivisional magistrate Ashwani Kumar for help.
 
 Earlier reports had said there were four missing NIT students, but police said they had received complaints about two only. Mandi ASP Khulbhushan Verma said, “We collected call details of the students. Police, with the help of local mountaineers and residents, launched a search operation on Friday morning. Two bodies were recovered and are being brought to Mandi for autopsy after which they will be handed over to the parents.” Eight youths had gone missing near Kullu in March last year. A massive search mission was launched and they were saved after three days.
