Mumbai:   is using   to provide fire insurance cover for small and medium enterprise ( ) clients, which would have been otherwise uneconomical to pursue.

 The company has deployed a chatbot to do the job of an insurance underwriter, by generating queries in respect of the proposal. Sanjeev Mantri, executive director,  , said that the new process has reduced transaction time as the company stands by the quote generated by the chatbot and issues policies based on it. “In the conventional method, the intermediary goes back to the customer to seek details and there is a bit of going to and fro before the policy is issued,” he said.
 
 Unlike motor or health insurance, which are standardised covers, fire insurance for SMEs is priced based on underwriting. In other words, an official assesses the risk and provides a quote based on various inputs keyed in by the agent.
 
 In case of motor insurance, since the pricing is based on a standard table of rates, buying a policy is a straight-through process without any human intervention. However, in case of non-tariff policies, every proposal has to be scrutinised by an underwriting officer, who will provide a quote. The chatbots would enable automation of the process.
 
 This is not the first time that the company is using technology for an underwriting function. In motor insurance, whenever there is a break in policy, norms require that the insurance company renews the policy only after a physical inspection. ICICI Lombard has developed a mobile app, which would guide the car-owner to shoot a video that is automatically uploaded. An insurance quote is then generated.
 
 The company has created a similar facility for pre-insurance inspection of an SME’s plant and machinery. This is particularly useful for SMEs, where the premium is too low to justify the cost of a physical survey of the premises.
