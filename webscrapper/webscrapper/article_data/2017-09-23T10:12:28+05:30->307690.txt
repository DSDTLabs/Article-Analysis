The other two were in the back with Sharath's body on the floor.

 “Around 1am, they reached Ramohalli Lake. While the car engine and headlights were on, they took out the body, tied huge stones to it using a barb wire and pushed it into the lake.The five then returned to the lake on September 14 to find the body floating. They pulled out the body and again tied it with more stones and dumped it in the waters,“ police said.
 
 The gang visited the lake again on September 16 and September 18. They returned as they didn't see the body floating. “On September 20, they revisited the lake and found the body had surfaced again,“ the police said.
 
 The five then decided to shift the body . “Placing the gunny bag that had Sharath's body inside the car's boot, they drove around west Bengaluru,“ the police said. A foul smell was emanating from the body . “They drove to Ajjana-Katte, a quarry near   dam, 5km from Ramohalli Lake. They dug a pit next to the road and buried the body," the police said.
