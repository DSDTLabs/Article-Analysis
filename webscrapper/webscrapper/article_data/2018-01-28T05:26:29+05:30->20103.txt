MUMBAI: On Friday evening, first day back from hospital, 60-year-old Irfan Khan (name changed) put on this best clothes to go to the mosque near his home after a long time. Suffering from   for almost a decade, Khan lost his voice almost two years ago. Following a   recently, Khan has   giving him yet another shot at normal life.

 Research say about 90% of Parkinson’s patients develop speech difficulty and almost all develop a  . Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is now the standard of care for patients with  . It involves implantation of a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to brain nuclei for the treatment of movement. 
 
 “For the last two years, the speech trouble had become very intense. He had almost completely moved to using sign language and had difficulty swallowing too. And while we have known about the DBS surgery we weren't confident about its practicality,” said Khan's wife.
 
 After much convincing and financial planning, the family decided on the operation. “In my experience of 20 years and international interactions, I hadn't seen speech improving a lot with DBS making this is an unusual case. Khan's disability was very high, so the family agreed on the surgery. We operated on him two weeks ago. After the successful surgery he is now able to speak after two years,” said Dr Paresh Doshi, director of neurosurgery, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre. While it is known to largely help a patient's gait, there haven't been cases of helping with speech, he added. 
 
 Back home, Khan is getting back to doing things on his own. “We are closely monitoring if and how the device is helping him. But one thing that we are relieved about is that we know it is going to be fine because of the pacemaker in the brain,” said his wife.
