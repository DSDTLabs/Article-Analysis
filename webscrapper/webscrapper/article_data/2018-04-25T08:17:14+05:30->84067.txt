Violating rules and government orders, various institutions are felling trees on their land without permission of the social forestry department in Ernakulam. Ironically, they approach the forest department when it is the turn to sell these logs.

 They approach the social forestry department requesting the services of an official to fix rate of logs before putting it for auction. The department receives around 100 applications from various departments especially revenue department, every month raising the demand. Since the felling of trees on government land is being done without permission, the social forestry department filed police complaint for theft and non-compliance of government order.
 
 The recent application received by the department is from   in Panangad. The letter, copy of which is with TOI, seeks assistance of an official for fixing rate of logs of Indian almond, pine and anjili which has been felled in the campus. The letter, signed by registrar, said that three trees were felled as the leaves were falling in the pool constructed for teaching swimming to varsity students. 
 
 "There is no need to seek permission from the social forestry department to cut trees in our campus. We felled only one tree when its leaves began polluting the swimming pool. We fell it after receiving permission from the head of the institution. We need permission from the department only to take the logs out of the campus," the registrar said.
