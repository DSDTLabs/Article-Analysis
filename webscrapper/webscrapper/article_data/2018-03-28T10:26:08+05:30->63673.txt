PANCHKULA: The challenges that the commuters go through while crossing   light point, which is one of the prime areas that connects   and Chandigarh, would now be addressed soon. Police here have come up with an idea to make the situation better for commuters, who have to face a lot of harassment and inconvenience during protests. 

 A large number of commuters pass through this stretch every day and during protest the situation here gets worse for its main stakeholders.
 
 Panchkula commissioner of police (CP) A S Chawla after receiving numerous complaints from the residents regarding the traffic jams and other problems faced by the commuters, called up assistant commissioner of police (traffic)   and asked him to prepare a plan to counter the challenge.
 
 The top cop after examining the situation found out that the major issue of traffic starts at   roundabout as multiple lanes of traffic start to form all of a sudden. "The other stretches/diversions do not face such issues. Problem of traffic near Mouli Jagran is a serious one," he said.
 
 The cop said the Panchkula police now need to coordinate with the Chandigarh police and install temporary cones at the stretch to divide the road for easy transit.
 
 "I found that there was a need of coordination between Panchkula and Chandigarh traffic cops to sort out the problem of traffic   during every protest at the Housing Board light point. As the Chandigarh traffic cops are ready to assist, we would be able to manage the rush during any protest," said commissioner Chawla
 
 "Besides this, we will stop the protestors to enter the Sector 5 rally ground," he added.
 
 President of   S K Nayar, said, "The traffic cops fail to manage jams near the Housing Board light point during every protest. A serious step in this direction needs to be taked to resolve the issue."
