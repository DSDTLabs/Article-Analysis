Ghaziabad: Scores of   workers on Saturday staged a   infront of the party office at Rajnagar District Centre against party general secretary   for BSP’s dismal performance in the assembly elections. They also demanded his expulsion from BSP.

 The protesters claimed Siddiqui misled party supremo Mayawati. “We demand his expulsion from the party. He and his son Afzal Siddiqui misled Behenji and sold tickets to the highest bidders,” said Sachin Siddharth, a protester. They shouted slogans against Siddiqui, who is also the party incharge for western UP, and tried to burn his effigy. However, they were stopped by police. 
 
 Another party worker, Brij Gautam, accused Siddiqui of not taking party workers in confidence before distributing tickets to the candidates. “He was unaware of the ground realities and acted in an autocratic manner. We had to pay a price in the elections as he gave misleading information to Mayawati,” he said.
 
 The party workers, who had gathered from western districts of Meerut, Hapur and Bulandshahr, also submitted a memorandum to the party's office-bearers in   demanding expulsion of Siddiqui and his son.
 
 Meanwhile, BSP’s district incharge Prem Chand Bharti, claimed that a lot of protesters were not from the party. “The party does the share the sentiment of the protesters. Many of them were not even from the BSP,” he said.
 
 BSP managed to win only 19 seats in the recently concluded assembly elections that saw BJP winning with a thumping three-fourth majority.
