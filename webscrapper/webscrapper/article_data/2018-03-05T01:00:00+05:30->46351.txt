It's never too late to make a debut in the field of acting. At least, that is what the 85-year-old Lucknow denizen   proves. The newcomer will be seen playing Saurabh Shukla’s mother in the Ajay Devgn-starrer ' '. Ajay went out of his way to make his co-star comfortable on the set. He was particular about their shooting schedules together and would even ensure that her scenes were shot on priority. She was seldom made to wait for her scenes. The rest of the cast replicated the actor’s gesture towards her.

 Director  , who has helmed 'Raid', says, “Pushpa Joshi was a darling. She is so charming and graceful that everyone wanted to be around her. She has a great sense of humour. I was really flabbergasted by her professionalism at that age. She was thorough with her lines and was energetic throughout. For me, she’s exemplifies the fact that if you really aspire, age is just a number. It was an absolute pleasure working with her.”
