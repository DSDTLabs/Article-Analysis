GANDHINAGAR: The  , which lost 83 of 182 seats in the 2017 assembly elections, much lower than its 2012 score, plans to go on a damage control drive in the assembly constituencies it lost to offset possible losses in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 BJP won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2014. However, if voting trends from the 2017 assembly elections hold, the BJP is set to lose nine Lok Sabha seats in 2019 clearly and will face a tough fight on several others where lead margins are slim. 
 
 A senior BJP leader privy to the development said, “The party has decided to aggressively start damage control in the constituencies we lost in December 2017 elections. Senior leaders including the state president   will tour all such constituencies and submit a report on issues on the organisational side and governance side. In coordination with the government, the party will try to resolve these issues, with Lok Sabha preparations in mind.”
 
 “After the elections, the party solicited feedback on each seat that will also be used to make the necessary changes before the elections,” sources added. The Lok Sabha constituencies where the BJP is behind the   are Patan Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Surendranagar, Porbandar Junagadh, Amreli, Bharuch and Anand. The BJP has seen a fall in its votes across all assembly segments from the 2014 figure.
