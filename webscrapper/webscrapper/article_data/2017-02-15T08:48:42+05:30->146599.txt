MUMBAI: To woo women in the civic polls, the   has released a separate manifesto addressing women’s issues.

 The manifesto, released by Madhavi Naik, state president of the party’s Mahila Morcha (women’s wing), assures protection to women especially those working at odd hours in the information and technology and media sectors. The party has already released a general manifesto for the BMC poll.
 
 Elaborating on the need for a separate manifesto, Naik said, “Although there is 50% reservation for women in all local bodies, it has been observed more than 50% of people who turn out to vote are women.” 
 
 Naik said the manifesto focuses on women-related issues like health, skill development, self-defence, empowerment, security and employment. She also claimed the BJP was the first party to come out with such a manifesto for women.
 
 The manifesto will be applicable not only to the Mumbai corporations but also for nine other municipal corporations and 25 zilla parishads in the state. “The party has not only thought about issues related to urban areas, but also about problems faced by women staying on the outskirts of cities like Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Pune,” she said. 
 
  The six-page manifesto assured a reserved day in hospitals for cancer detection for women, toilets for women every 2km and at market places and gardens, participation and joint ownership for women in slum redevelopment and Pantpradhan Aawas Yojana, hostels for working women in each city and a day care centre for elderly women among other things.
 
 Naik said the BJP’s women’s wing will ensure implementation of the promises outlined in the manifesto.
