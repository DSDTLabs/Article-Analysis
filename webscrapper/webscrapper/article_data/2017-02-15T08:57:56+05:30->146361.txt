AHMEDABAD: Florists rejoice when   arrives and the reason is not difficult to guess. Flower sales go up significantly a day ahead and continue on Valentine’s Day. The impact of   seems to have had no impact on florists across the city. From the evening of February 13 till February 14, flower sales rose four-fold and prices doubled.

 Randhir Sultania, a florist on Anandnagar Road, said against an average daily flower sales worth Rs 10,000, he was hoping to do business worth Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 on Monday and Tuesday. “Flower sales are usually good on these two days — Valentine’s Day and the day before that. Besides, thanks to online gifting portals, the number of orders have risen as well,” Sultania said.
 
 A long stem rose usually costs Rs 15-20 apiece but ahead of Valentine’s Day, its price rises sharply. At times, rose rates touch Rs 40 apiece. The bulk of flower orders from the wholesale market has also gone up.
 
 Amid demonetization and cash shortage, several florists have either partnered with gifting portals or come up with their own website to be able to accept online orders.
 
 Himanshu Rami, a florist in Vastrapur, said they had received maximum online orders this time against walk-in purchases. “The rush is unusually high on Valentine’s Day and we have had to hire more people to deliver on time,” Rami said.
 
 In fact, some florists have also hired auto-rickshaw drivers to meet the rush. “I have been working for a florist in Satellite and delivering flowers. Whenever there is a rise in delivery demand, rickshaw drivers are roped in to ensure timely delivery,” said  , an auto rickshaw driver.
