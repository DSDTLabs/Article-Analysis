Madurai: It is almost frightening to see the railings of the bridge over Viraganoor Dam on River Vaigai on the outskirts of the city. One end of the bridge has a dangerous appearance with the railings withering away as concrete is seen falling apart .

 Viraganoor dam, a regulator with 18 vents constructed in 1975 at a cost of Rs 18 lakh, is eight kilometers away from the city and the dam is also used to divert water into channels besides storing the water. The dam also has a park on Viraganoor side and it could have been a perfect picnic spot had the parks been maintained well.
 
 The bridge above the regulator connects Viraganoor with Sakkimangalam and is used by hundreds of people on daily basis including school students. The bridge is also used for light traffic mostly by two wheeler riders to cross the river.
 
 Of late, the side railing of the bridge has been falling apart as they are dilapidated. "A lot of children walk through the bridge every day. It will be good if authorities take note of it before something untoward happens," said K Dharmaraja from Sakkimangalam.
 
 “The bridge at Sakkimangalam side has a steep curve proceeding to the river. These side railings are important because if someone speeds on the curve, they may plunge into the river. So it is important that the railings are strong,” says D Ramsingh from Viraganoor.
 
 The dam is maintained by public works department's (PWD) Sivaganga division and they have replaced one side of the railing at Viraganoor side recently. "We will be replacing the railings on the other side also in this financial year. It will be from the regular maintenance funds set aside for the dam", said a senior official from PWD.
