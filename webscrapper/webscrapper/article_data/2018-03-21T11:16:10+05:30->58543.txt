After announcing his retirement roughly two years ago,   - the   General Manager - stood in the middle of the ring on Tuesday night and revealed that he has been medically cleared to compete. 

 
 
 The fact that the rumor mills had missed this huge development only added to the surprise element. It could be viewed that   played it really really well or the timing just about managed to be perfect. To add someone of Bryan’s calibre to the already stacked Wrestlemania card will be huge, but Bryan was quick to reiterate that his place in the Wrestlemania 34 card is not a certainty. 
 
 However, the big storyline creative went with at the show on Tuesday hints that WWE will keep the fans guessing about Bryan’s involvement at the grandest stage of ‘em all. After thanking the fans and everyone involved in a touching address to open the show, Bryan got some in-ring action, courtesy the ‘Yep’ movement. 
 
 After last week’s actions - a brutal attack on SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon - Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn were fired from WWE by Bryan. The shocked duo then turned on Bryan with another 2-on-1 assault. 
 
 Bryan though fought back bringing back the Yes Kicks and with a barrage of hesitation drop kicks to both Zayn and Owens to the corner posts, made a huge statement upon his return. But the numbers game caught up with the former WWE Champion and Zayn hit a Helluva kick on Bryan before Owens delivered a powerbomb on the apron. Medical personnel tended to the battered Bryan.
 
 Barring this major storyline, SmackDown rolled on with its usual matches. The US title picture for the Wrestlemania 34 was confirmed to be a triple threat with Jinder Mahal officially added to the card on expected line. Some would say he might be the dark horse to win the title at New Orleans.
