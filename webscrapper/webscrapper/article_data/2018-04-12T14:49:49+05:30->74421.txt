VADODARA: Wednesday’s fire at M S   has once again brought forth the issue of safety of the university staffers and officials on surface. 

 Fortunately, the corridor in which the old syndicate room is located was not occupied by the staffers due to ongoing furniture work in the exam section. 
 
 But the second incident of fire has put a big question mark on whether fire safety measures are being adopted seriously at the university head office 
 
 After the fire in February,   had already incurred an expense of Rs 25 lakh in carrying out the restoration work. This expense was in addition to the damage that the fire had caused to the furniture, computers, printers, hard disks, scanners and records of three years. 
 
 “We had carried out all the fire safety measures after the incident in February and taken all the measures as per guidelines,” MSU engineer N K Ojha said after Wednesday’s fire.
 
 After the fire in February, the university’s construction division had issued a missive asking all the faculties and institutes functioning under the umbrella of the university to get no objection certificates from the Vadodara Fire and   (VFES) which had served a notice to MSU for not having a proper fire fighting system at the university head office. 
 
 “We are fortunate that the fire was noticed immediately. If it was delayed even by half an hour, the fire would have damaged the entire corridor in the exam section,” said a teacher.
