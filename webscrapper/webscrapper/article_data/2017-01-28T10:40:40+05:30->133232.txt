NAGPUR: “Humanity is getting diminished day by day due to modernization,” said  , noted thinker and professor of Shivaji University, Kolhapur.

 He was speaking during a talk on saints and nation creation organized by   at its convocation Hall on Friday. “After 1947, the concept of nation started getting over,” Gavas added. 
 
 Great saints like Tulsidas, Rohidas, Mira, Sufism, Dnyaneshwar, Kanak Das and Purandas gave a similar message for peace, he said. According to Dnyaneshwar, Gavas said, the universe is our home and the truth is a tool of living a life. 
 
 “Though we have advantages of modernization, women of our society are still facing problems,” Gavas said.
 
 Gavas said that non-violence, truth and peace is the concept of a nation which no one realizes today. “Even the thoughts of saints have been incorporated in the Constitution, but no one follows them,” Gavas said. He expressed his unhappiness over the fact that today the department of philosophy in many universities is getting closed.
 
 SP Kane, vice-chancellor of NU, said, “Saints are more important than politicians and scientists. Politician are concerned about their votes while scientist are involved in research. But only saints show the path of leading a good life.”
