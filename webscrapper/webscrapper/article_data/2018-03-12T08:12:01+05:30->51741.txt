CHENNAI: Six members of the   including a senior railway official and a prominent dancer from Chennai met the Union culture minister Mahesh Sharma last week regarding the ‘desecration of the sacred spaces’ inside Kalakshetra, the world-renowned performing arts institute in Chennai.

 They also submitted a written memorandum to the ministry. In a 15-minute meeting with Sharma, the alumni briefed him about an event held on the premises of Kalakshetra in mid-February which was a festival on organic food, waste management and yoga.
 
 
 Former director Leela Samson had written about these issues in a Facebook post (now deleted) that this had shocked everyone associated with the institute.
 
 The event had a flash mob which, according to the   (KF) board chairman N Gopalaswami, caused the controversy. This was part of efforts taken by theinstituteto monetise the assets. But it would only be given out for good purposes, Gopalaswami had said earlier.
 
 The six members — Anita Ratnam, Shangita Namasivayam, P T Narendran, Swagata Sen Pillai, Archana Karry and   — who met the minister were from Delhi, Hyderabad and even Malaysia.
 
 Alumni from across the country also sent 70 letters to the ministry on the issue.
 
 “We have requested for a larger representation of the institute’s alumni on the governing board. This is to help ensure that the philosophy and values of the founders and   are adhered to. Currently there is just one alumnus on the board,” said Shangita.
 
 The alumni told the minister that this was because only the alumni will be able to understand the ethos of the institute and ensure that events from across the country — like the annual festival in February — do not violate it in any way.
