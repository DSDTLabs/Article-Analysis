CHENNAI: Actor-turned-politician   Haasan on Monday reached out to political leaders of all parties, both regional and national, for a meet on behalf of farmers on Tamil Nadu’s rights over Cauvery to be held in Chennai on Saturday.

 
 The DMK too has announced an all-party meeting on Thursday. Kamal Haasan called on DMK working president M K Stalin in person on Monday evening and invited him for the meeting, which is to be chaired by veteran communist leader R Nallakannu. Kamal spoke to actor Rajinikanth, who is to launch his own political party soon, and personally invited him to be present for the meeting, after explaining the need for it. Haasan reached out to leaders of several other political parties over phone due to time constraints. These included AMMK deputy general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, TNCC president S Thirunavukkarasar, BJP state president Tamilisai Soundarajan, DMDK’s Vijayakant, TMC’s G K Vasan, Tamizhar Vazhvurimai Katchi’s Velmurugan and   state secretary   and even Nadigar Sangam among others. “I am only a tool in this. The initiative came from the farmers, who were meeting me in batches. When I suggested how we could all unite and consolidate, they readily agreed. There is a need for solidarity and they are all keen,” Kamal Haasan told TOI.
 
 
 It was decided to take it to the next level, by reaching out to political parties. “This is not apolitical alliance. This is an attempt to unite all parties along with the farmers under one umbrella. The culture of solidarity has been missing in Tamil Nadu and I hope this will pave way for that,” Haasan said, while not wanting to hazard a guess on how many of them will participate in Saturday’s meeting.
