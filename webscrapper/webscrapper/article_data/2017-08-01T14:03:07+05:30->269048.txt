PANAJI: CM Manohar   said on Monday the Army’s ability to square-off against PLA of   at   is an outcome of PM Narendra Modi’s policy and the decisions taken during his tenure as the defence minister. Parrikar said the Army’s operational readiness and confidence had increased due to the backing of the government and the improvement in arms and ammunition supplies.

 “When I was in Delhi, I worked hard as a defence minister, I did a lot of work. And the effect of that work can be seen today where the Indian Army has the strength to face China at Doklam. It is the outcome of the decisions taken during my stint in the   government,” Parrikar said. 
 
 Parrikar went on to add that a comptroller and auditor general report, with 2013 as the reference point, showed that when A K Anthony was the defence minister in the UPA government the Army had ammunition for just 10 days. “It shows what the situation was. I have totally changed the situation,” Parrikar said.
