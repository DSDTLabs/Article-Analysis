PANAJI:   chairman   on Thursday said if any mining dependants were willing to begin a business in order to be self-sufficient, the EDC would be more than willing to handhold them. He was responding to questions over reports that certain mining firms had asked their employees not to show up for work. “This is the sad part of the whole judgment. Many times, our learned judges miss the point that with their judgments, livelihoods are also affected. We saw this recently with the liquor ban that affected many livelihoods. It is, however, inevitable and we have find to ways and means to deal with it,” he said.

 Kuncalienker said the EDC was coming out with schemes to help entrepreneurs stand on their own feet. “If a mining dependant is keen on doing a business, the EDC will be more than willing to help him make a living. We have to find ways around this judgement,”   said. tnn
