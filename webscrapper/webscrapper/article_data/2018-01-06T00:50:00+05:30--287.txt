Mangaluru: The coastal districts may be synonymous with moral policing and communal tension, but there is a silver lining in most incidents--- humanity always rises above religion. On Wednesday, when 28-year-old Deepak Rao, a marketing executive was attacked brutally by four men on a sunny afternoon and crying for help, it was his employer Majid who came to his rescue. The incident took outside Majid’s house in Katipalla. Majid says he has lost a family member in Deepak’s death. Deepak was with him for the last seven years. He distributed mobile sim cards, currency and collected payments. Most of his customers were Muslims and he frequented areas dominated by them in Surathkal. He also spoke ‘Beary’ language fluently. Majeed, however, refrained from attending the funeral on Thursday. The same Wednesday evening, when Basheer, a hotelier was closing down his shop in Akashabhavana and heading home, unidentified bike-borne miscreants attacked him around 11.30pm. CCTV footage showed the assault and him screaming for help. It was Shekar, an ambulance driver who was going home who came to his rescue. “At first I thought, Basheer may be the victim of a hit-and-run case as he was lying next to the road. When I went near him I realized that he had been assaulted. Nevertheless, I rushed him to hospital,” he told a regional news channel. It was Abdul Rauf, who runs a fruit shop near BC Road, who rushed RSS member Sharath Madivala, 28, to the hospital in his autorickshaw when the latter was attacked by bike-borne assailants last July 4. The assailants barged into Madivala’s family-owned laundry shop on the busy BC Road and attacked him. He succumbed to the injuries three days later. Recalling the incident that night, Rauf says he had just finished namaz in his tiny shop when he heard cries for help. When he reached the spot, he saw Sharath in a pool of blood. He arranged for a vehicle to rush him to hospital.
