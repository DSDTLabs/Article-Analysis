THANE: The city unit of the   on Monday staged a throaty protest at the Mulund   naka demanding the abolition of the ‘seemingly never-ending toll’ and ease of passage for city motorists.

 NCP city unit chief Anand Paranjpe led the protest and shouted slogans condemning MSRDC minister   for failing to do away with the toll.
 
 He said toll collection was the primary case of traffic congestion in the city as all the heavy vehicular traffic which would use the   route has started using the interior city roads to commute.
 
 “Since the Mumbra Bypass road has been shutdown for repair works the traffic department has diverted vehicles towards Thane city areas. Due to this there is traffic congestion and the toll plaza is adding to their misery as they have to halt to pay the toll,’’ he said. 
 
 Paranjpe said it is unfair for motorists driving towards Navi Mumbai via Airoli to pay the toll twice. So a demand to stop the toll collection at Mulund till the work at Mumbra Bypass is complete so that there is no traffic.
 
 The Mumbra Bypass has been shut and the commuters and truckers have to pay toll twice if they are traveling from Thane to Navi Mumbai. Also, due to the traffic congestion it takes over an hour for a person to cross just the toll plaza, claim the commuters who are facing a tough time.
