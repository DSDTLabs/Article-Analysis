 She said, “The Telugu Desam Party, which came into being with a slogan of self-respect for the Telugu people, will not tolerate the injustice done to the state. We will intensify our protest on on this issue.”
 
 Sowmya appreciated the hundreds of agitators who participated in protests, and said that the demand for special status is coming from the public. She said the BJP will face a tough time in the state for ignoring the promises made to the people.

The special status will help us attract industries, which will help in providing employment to our youth.
