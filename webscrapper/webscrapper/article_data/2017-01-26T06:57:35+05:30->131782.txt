THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after  's (KTU) registrar submitted a report to the government on a host of violations at   in Kottayam,   ordered a   on Wednesday. Vijayan ordered an enquiry based on the recommendation of education minister C Raveendranath. The probe will also investigate the allegations raised by students and parents. 

 Sources said the two-member committee led by registrar GP Padmakumar and controller of examinations S Shabu had submitted a report to the government that the affiliation file of the engineering college for 2016-17 was missing at the university. It was said in the report that the college was not working at the place where it was supposed to, as per the documents submitted to the university.
 
 It is learnt that the registrar informed the government that he did not issue affiliation to the college in 2016-17, but the college produced a copy of the affiliation letter when they were asked to submit the same.
 
 Lending more credence to the allegations that the e-governance solution used by the university was flawed, the registrar asked the government to carry out a study to ensure its robustness. "The affiliation certificate presented by Toms College carried the name of the registrar though he did not issue the same. Also, migration certificate was issued to a student in the name of the registrar without his knowledge," sources said.
 
 The committee had visited Toms College and recorded statements of students and their parents, who repeated the allegations of mental harassment and torture, especially girls, by the college management.
 
 Several students have asked the government and university to make arrangements for alternative facilities to complete their course.
