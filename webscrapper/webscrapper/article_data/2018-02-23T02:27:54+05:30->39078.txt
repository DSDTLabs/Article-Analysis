NEW DELHI: Delhi government employees on Thursday observed a five-minute silence outside their respective offices as a protest against the alleged assault on chief secretary Anshu Prakash by AAP MLAs. In a collective show of strength, a joint forum of the   association, DANICS and DASS   said the incident had “breached the faith of all government employees in the political executive of Delhi government and left them anguished”. 

 The five-minute silence was observed at Delhi Secretariat,   headquarters and the Women and Child Development department, among other offices. 
 
 Home secretary Manoj Parida led the protest at the secretariat, which houses the offices of the chief minister and cabinet ministers. The “silent protest” would be organised for five minutes every day at 1.30pm to make a “strong statement”, the forum said in a statement. 
 
 “Till the government takes tangible steps to ensure the safety and dignity of all government employees, the protest will continue,” divisional commissioner Manisha Saxena, who is also secretary of IAS (AGMUT) Officers’ Association, said. “There has been no apology from the chief minister so far,” she said. 
 
 The officers added that they would continue their boycott of the government till the chief minister apologised.
