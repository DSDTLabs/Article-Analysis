JAIPUR: The new method of family planning has been launched at   hospital and   (CHC) of Phagi, Bassi and Phulera even though the areas are not covered under the Centre’s   (MPV).

 For the MPV programme, 14 districts in the state have been identified and  , an injection that helps women not to conceive for at least three months with a single dose, is now available in all these medical facilities. These injections are provided free of cost.
 
 But deputy chief medical health officer (Jaipur-II) Dr   said other community health centres of the district will soon have the availability of Antara. 
 
 The government has introduced it as a better option for spacing between two children without surgery. The existing methods for spacing are postpartum intrauterine devices (PPIUD) which needs minor surgery and pills, which remain effective for a very short time.
 
 In the 14 districts identified for intensive and improved family planning services, Antara has already been made available up to primary health centres. These districts have total fertility rate (indicates the number of children a woman will have in her lifetime) higher than three.
 
 These districts are among the 145 high focus districts for improved family planning services in the country, which are covered under MPV.
 
 Under MPV, officials are focussing on improving access to contraceptives through delivering assured services, dovetailing new promotional schemes, ensuring commodity security, building capacity (service providers), creating an enabled environment along with close monitoring and implementation.
