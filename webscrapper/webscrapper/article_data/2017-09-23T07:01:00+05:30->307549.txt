NOIDA: The Noida Authority on Friday promised to help homebuyers get 10,756   by   2017, close on the heels of   Industrial Development Authority saying that it would ensure delivery of more than 17,000 residential units across 28 group housing projects by March 2018. 

 That is still, however, far short of the CMâ€™s directive to facilitate handover of 50,000 flats to buyers over the next three months. 
 
 Alok Tandon, chairperson and CEO of Noida Authority, sent a detailed plan of completion of these units to principal secretary (industries) earlier this week.
 
 According to officials, the authority has arrived at the figure after holding open house meetings with the builders of 32 projects and asking them to provide a detailed timeline for completing the projects. The plan includes completion and handing over of flats in four months, including Septem-ber 2017. Officials also said while builders of 20 projects have promised to seek completion of 2,513 flats in September, 19 others have given their timeline for completing 2,828 residential units by October 2017. 
 
 Builders of another 20 projects will complete 2,166 flats by November and the rest of the 20 will complete 3,249 residential units by December 2017. The projects that will be completed this month include that of builders Assotech, AIMS RG Angel, Great Value, Today Homes, Mahagun, Maxblis, PAN Realtors, Oppulent Infra, Sunworld, Unitech, AGC Realty, Gulshan Homz, Jaypee Greens Aman, Amrapali, and others. The projects that will be completed in October through December this year include that of builders Great Value Projects, RG Residency, E-Homes Infra, Today Homes, Unitech, Jaypee Greens Aman, Amrapali, Futech Shelters, etc.
 
 Officials further said that nine projects of builders including Gardenia AIMS Developers, Colourful Estate, Divine India, Perfect Prop Builders, Sunshine Infrawell, IV County, Supertech and Ajnara India have promised to hand over another 5,000 residential units by December 2017 once they obtain completion certificates.
