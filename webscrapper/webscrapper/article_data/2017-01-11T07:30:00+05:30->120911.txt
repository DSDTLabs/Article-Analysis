 The CBI took over the probe from Punjab police.
 
 In its recommendation to handing over of probe to CBI, Punjab government home department had said, “All these three incidents are interconnected and appear to be handiwork of same persons or organisation.”
 
 “There is commonality in all these cases...All these cases are result of some conspiracy and are part of sinister design of some hostile/anti-national group or organisation whose motive is to disturb peace and law and order in the state. There is urgent need to apprehend the culprits for unearthing the conspiracy and to solve these cases,” it said.
 
 Two accused wanted in the explosive case have already fled the country, it said.
