Nagpur: A woman caught her husband red-handed while he was raping their 14-year-old daughter at their rented place in New Kamptee on Sunday night.

 The woman somehow rescued the minor from the accused and took her to the police station. She lodged an offence against the accused, who was immediately arrested.
 
 Police said the accused and the survivor came to the city from Chhattisgarh around three months ago, but the complainant stayed back for work. The duo worked as labourers at a construction site. The cops said the accused brought the minor so that she would cook for him.
 
 Since a fortnight, the accused, who is addicted to alcohol, started sexually exploiting minor. He also threatened to kill her if she discloses the matter to anyone. Finally, she shared her plight with the neighbours, but they too didn’t put their faith in her ordeals.
 
 The cops said the survivor again narrated her grievances to the neighbours and also gave them her mother’s number so that they could convey her message. Accordingly, they told her mother who reached here on July 21. But she too didn’t trust her daughter.
 
 On Sunday, the complainant went out for some work and the accused grabbed the chance to exploit his daughter. The complainant returned home before time. As she entered through the open door, she was shocked to see her husband sexually exploiting their daughter.
 
 After reaching the police station, the minor told the cops about the constant physical and mental harassment.
 
 Police have registered an offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.
