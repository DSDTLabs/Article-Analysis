Mhow: Under acute potable  , Jalokhiya villagers in Dhar district are forced to drink   water of a pond for the past one week.

 About 16 kilometres away from the district headquarters, wells and borewells in Jalokhiya village, have dried up. The villagers have to travel for almost three km every day to fetch water for their daily needs. 
 
 The pond from where they fetch water has turned green due to presence of algae and other aquatic plants. After brining the water at their homes, the villagers have to filter it with a cloth and then boil it in order to make the water consumable.
 
 Narrating the sorry state, a villager,   said that he was having a bullock cart, which he used to transport water from the pond to his house. The water is used not only for   purpose but also for cattle. “Water crisis starts in the village every year in the first week June. But, we are not badly affected by it because monsoon arrives soon. This time the situation has turned worst. Travelling three kilometres to fetch water is very troublesome and we get dirty water even after so much of toil,” he said.
 
 Jalokhiya sarpanch   said that he had told about the situation in the village to janpad panchayat and district panchayat but no action was taken so far.
 
 Local MLA Umang Singar claimed that he was not aware of the situation. “I could have taken appropriate action had I got information about it earlier,” he said.
