The precincts of the over 800-year-old Sri Ramachandra Swamy Temple in Ammapalle, Shamshabad,, provided a surreal setting for the staging of the Bharatnatyam ballet presented by   and her troupe. Titled, ‘Sri Rama Namam — Entha Ruchira Ra’, the performance which retold the story of   left the 500-odd crowd who thronged the venue enthralled. The temple echoed to the rhythms of melodiously lyrical Ramadasu keertanas, mostly renowned and some unknown, that filled the air with deep devotion as the Padma Shri Awardee brought the music and bhakti of Sant Ramadasu back to life with her masterful production. Here are snap shots from what was a magical evening.

 Ananda Shankar was a picture of poise and perfection as she effortlessly switched roles from the sprightly golden deer Mareecha to the valiant Laxmana, the hapless Sita to ever benevolent Lord Rama — all in a heartbeat. It was her depiction of Bhakta Ramadasu that stood out though. From his utter devotion towards Lord Ram to the pathos he evokes when he’s in incarceration — Ananda, with her evocative abhinaya, transported her audience to the 16th century Golconda where the poet saint lived.
