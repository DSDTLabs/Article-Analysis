NEW DELHI: By the end of April, commuters in the capital would be able to use their Delhi   smart cards to travel in all   (DTC) and Cluster scheme buses.

 In January, Delhi joined the ranks of London, Hong Kong and Singapore with the launch of its own common mobility card, which can be used to travel both in the   as well as public transport buses. However, the facility was available only on 250 buses, 200 buses of DTC and 50 of Cluster scheme.
 
 “The work is on to extend the facility in all buses of Delhi and we are very hopeful that by the end of April, it would be achieved,” said a transport department official. “We are in the process of procuring Secure Access Module (SAM) chips, which   (ETMs) in the buses would be equipped with. The SAM chips will allow the ETMs to access Delhi Metro smart cards and deduct the fare from the card and issue a ticket,” he said.
 
 In January, CM   had said that the facility would be available by April 1.
