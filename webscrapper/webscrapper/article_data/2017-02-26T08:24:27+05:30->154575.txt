HYDERABAD: The two states Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may be at loggerheads over several issues, but they seem to have some things in common.
It may be recalled that this past Monday, the AP government convened a meeting of its   to discuss issues related to   and take some decisions. However, AP's Board has no legal sanctity as it does not follow Central government rules on the Board's composition.
 
 And this coming Monday, the Telangana government has called for a meeting of its State Board for Wildlife. And just as the AP board's meeting is expected to fail legal scrutiny, the Telangana board's meeting too is expected to come a cropper if anyone challenges the decisions taken at the meeting. This is because Telangana's board meeting is to be chaired by  , the minister for forests and environment instead of  , who as the chief minister is the designated chairman of the board. The laws relating to the board's functioning mandate that unless the meeting is chaired by the chief minister, any decisions taken by the board, or any discussions based on which future decisions can be taken, will have no legal sanctity. “The laws are very clear about this. A State Board of Wildlife meeting must be chaired by the chief mini ster. The Telangana government's bo ard meeting on Monday as it stands today, will not have any legal standing and any decisions taken will fail if challenged in a court by anyone,“ a source intimately familiar with the rules that govern the board, told STOI.
 
 “This is nothing but a display of utter disrespect of the laws by the two state governments,“ EAS Sarma, retired IAS officer who served as a secretary for the Union government said. “The main objectives of these meetings appear to be approving diversion of forest land and land from wildlife sanctuaries for other purposes,“ he said.
