 will have to declare their   structures for up to five years while admitting new students at the entry level from the next academic year, state education minister   said on Friday. 

 Tawde said several parents in Pune and Mumbai had complaints against “exorbitant fee hike” by some schools. A stricter provision in the  , besides withdrawing the no-objection certificate of non-state board schools, would soon be resolved to ensure all CBSE, ICSE and other non-state board schools did not violate rules related to fees hike, he added.
 
 The move was expected to also ensure that institutes did not make it compulsory for students and their parents to buy stationery items from schools,   told the media on the sidelines of an event in Pune. About 15-20 parents confronted Tawde about the state government’s stand on the fee hike issue and accused him of not taking any “real action” against errant schools.
 
 Tawde told them that the fee-related complaints would be heard in Mumbai on May 14. “We are receiving maximum complaints against private schools affiliated with non-state boards. The only action we can take against them for flouting rules is to withdraw the institution’s  . However, if we do that, students would suffer and we will have to make alternative arrangements for them.” 
 
 On complaints about schools making it mandatory to buy stationery from them, Tawde said it was not possible for the government to ask non-state board schools to distribute books for free like state board schools.
