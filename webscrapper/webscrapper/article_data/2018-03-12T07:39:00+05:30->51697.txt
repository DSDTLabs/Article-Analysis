GURUGRAM: The enforcement wing of department of town and country planning ( ) demolished around 35   along the   in revenue estate of village Nangli Umarpur.

 The shops were constructed along the road but were not functional. “The shops were constructed without seeking any approval,” said district town planner (enforcement) Rajendra T Sharma. He said drive would continue to remove the unauthorised constructions in sectors 59-68 to ensure that the planned development of sector roads in these areas should not be hampered and encroached upon.
 
 Sharma said the plots on which shops were constructed were under litigation as villagers and a private developer claim ownership of the land. The court directed to maintain the status quo despite local villagers constructing shops on the land. Unauthorised construction has emerged as a major challenge for planned development in new sectors. People are constructing unauthorised shops and labour hutments on private land along the road without getting any approval from the authority concerned.
 
 “The general public is advised not to raise any such unauthorised construction without permission of competent authorities in order to avoid any loss of their property construction,” said assistant town planner (ATP)  .
 
 In last two weeks, DTCP has carried out a massive demolition drive against unauthorised structures in new sectors. More than 500 structures were demolished in sectors 81-95 by DTCP during the three-day drive in the first week of March.
