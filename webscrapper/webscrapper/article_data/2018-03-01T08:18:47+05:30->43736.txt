MONACO:   has made a career out of pocketing trophies and winning accolades. And the trend continued on Monday as a week after becoming the oldest No.1 one ranked player in tennis history, the Swiss legend was crowned Sportsman of the Year at the 2018 Laureus World Sports Awards in   on Tuesday.

 
 Federer also walked away with the Comeback of the Year award, which was presented to him by German great  , thanks to a stellar year (2017) which saw him return from a six-month injury layoff to win seven titles, including the Australian Open and Wimbledon.
 
 Twins have always been a dominant theme in his life having fathered two sets of twins in daughters Myla Rose and Charlene Reva (8) and sons Lenny and Leo (4). His twin wins on Tuesday took his Laureus tally to six awards, making the 36-yearold the most decorated winner in the event’s history.
 
 Federer’s female counterpart   won the World Sportswoman of the Year award. The American conquered her 23rd Grand Slam title at last year’s Australian Open despite being eight weeks pregnant.
 
 Year 2017 was indeed special as   and Nadal rolled back the years with the two rivals going on to split the Grand Slams evenly. Nadal, in fact, was also in contention for the Sportsman of the Year gong. “I just wanted to just give a shout out to my rival Rafa. He had an unbelievable year himself,” Federer said.
