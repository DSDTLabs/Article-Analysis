PUNE: A new scheme to augment the city's water quota by 1.5 TMC and a tunnel from   to   through the hills are two ambitious projects that have been proposed in the Rs 5,912 crore annual   for 2017-18.

 Presenting the draft budget, standing committee chairman Muralidhar Mohol said the PMC plans to lift water from the Kundalika river, which flows at Kolad after one descends from the Tamhini ghat. The water will be carried through pipelines over 25km to the Varasgaon dam. Mohol said the city will get 1-1.5 TMC water from the project.
 
 The committee also proposed the first tunnel in the city from Pashan-Panchavati to Kothrud, which Mohol said would help decongest roads in those areas. Presently , people travelling between these two areas use the Chandani chowk-Bavdhan road.
 
 Interestingly, for the first time, the PMC's annual   book has published pictures of RSS leaders, including   and M S Golwalkar. Taking forward the saffron parties' measures on cow protection, the civic body has proposed sheds for stray cattle, especially cows, with an initial provision of Rs 50 lakh.
