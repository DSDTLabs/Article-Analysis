PUNE: Terming   as a “silent killer,“   experts on Thursday said that its adverse effects go undetected for a long time.

 Hence, their symptoms are only noticed when it is too late. Compared to commuting in public transport in a highly polluted city like Mumbai, factors causing indoor air pollution can be as much as 40 times more harmful.
 
 Director of Chest Research Foundation, India, and expert on effects of air pollution on health,   told TOI, “Lungs are the first organ to experience and process the polluted air we breathe.They can take a lot of abuse before manifesting any symptoms of bad health. So, it is only detected after the damage is done.“ Explaining indoor air pollution, Salvi said that lifestyle and socio-economic factor-based choices at home have a direct bearing on a person's health.
 
 “Due to the non-presence of immediate symptoms, many of these factors are never suspected to be causing harm,“ Salvi said.
 
 One of the biggest factors of indoor air pollution is bio mass-fuelled stoves (chulha).
 
 “Nearly 70 per cent of homes in India use chulha for cooking. Not only women who cook using this means but also their children are affected by the resultant pollution. The latter may suffer from respiratory tract infections, poor lung growth and asthma,“ he said.
 
 “We have always been led to believe that the leading pollutants in the country are emissions from conventional combustion engines of cars and other vehicles. But the reality is that the most harmful pollution comes from the safety of home,“ he said.
 
 Salvi was speaking at the launch of a special edition of  '.
 
 The current issue focuses on air pollution and the resultant health risks.
