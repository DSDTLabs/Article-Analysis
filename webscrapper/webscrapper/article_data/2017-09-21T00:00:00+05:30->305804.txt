Does the name Sultan Qureshi ring a bell? Well, it was   Tripathi’s role from the film Gangs of Wasseypur, which was highly acclaimed. Having been part of films like Fukrey, Nil Battey Sannata and Gunday, Pankaj is as happy as a clam. And why wouldn’t he as he is making his Kollywood debut in Rajinikanth’s  . On his role, he says, “I play a cop and I will be seen supporting the ‘system’. But the audience will never know whose side I am on. Director   had seen my performance in Gangs of Wasseypur and Nil Battey Sannata. So, his team had come down to Mumbai and narrated the story to me.” 

 Irrespective of his role, Pankaj says that he would have signed the film anyway just to work with  . “I was curious to know how an actor can be so famous. If I did not sign up to do this film, I would have perhaps met him on set. But now that I am doing the film, I got to spend almost a month with him. Like everybody says, he is indeed down-to-earth. I consider Rajini to be my idol. Who would say no to working with their idol? One gets to learn a lot by just being on the set and observing him. His movements, expressions and skills are unique. Working with an actor of this stature has just been so enriching.” 
 
 But the language, he says, has been an issue for him. “I found Tamil to be tough. There were times when Ranjith would ask me to do a scene and I would end up doing something else (laughs). Initially, it was quite a task understanding what the team wanted from me. Now, I have picked up. We also had someone to translate and that made things easier. My character will have short dialogues with lots of expression,” shares the actor.
