GURUGRAM:  , a restaurant in the part 2 area of   market, was gutted after it caught fire on Tuesday evening. No casualties have been reported. The fire department said the cause of the blaze had not been ascertained.

 The fire department was informed around 5.05 pm about the fire and two fire tenders were rushed to the spot. 
 
 By the time the fire tenders reached the spot, the blaze had already engulfed the restaurant and its basement. 
 
 “The employees and the customers were evacuated from the restaurant before it was gutted in the fire. The fire could have spread to the nearby stores and could have caused major damage. Our team got there on time, and it was brought under control,” assistant fire officer Sukhbir Yadav said.

 The fire also caused some damage to merchandise kept in a nearby store.
