Lucknowite  , of ' ', fame, ushered in 30th birthday in a unique way. The actress has gone on a 10-day solo trip to Istanbul. "I wanted to do something hatt ke on my 30th birthday and since I love travelling solo, I looked for places to which I could get the VISA easily and for which I don’t have to run from pillar to post to get things done. So   was the ideal destination which suited my criteria. And the moment I landed in Istanbul, I just fell in love with this place. I don’t think I could have thought of a better gift to give to myself on my 30th birthday," shared Aahana as we spoke to her on phone.
 And this isn;t Aahana’s first solo trip. "I love travelling and exploring new places and previously too I have travelled to several places alone. I like the whole idea of travelling solo, managing things on your own and yes, making new friends in a completely new place. Not only do I get to know about the place, but I also get an opportunity to know about myself. It is the best way I think, to know yourself by spending time alone,” adds Aahana, who is waiting to come to Lucknow. “I just look for a bahaana to come to Lucknow. Koi mujhe bole aur main Lucknow aana chahti hoon. I keep teasing my close friend   in Lucknow ki please call me to Lucknow and I will happily come to my hometown."
