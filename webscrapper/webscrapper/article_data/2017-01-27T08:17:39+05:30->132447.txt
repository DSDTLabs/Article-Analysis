BENGALURU: Justice P Vishwanath Shetty, who is set to assume office as Lokayukta, has promised a   with a   in place. In an interview with TOI, Justice Shetty said he believes in working as a team and seeking their suggestions to make the institution more potent. Excerpts:

 
 
 
 Yes, certainly. I am grateful that my appointment has received the assent of all the important constitutional authorities, including the governor, chief minister and chief justice. None of these people had any qualms. It’s a matter of pride and recognition for me as they did not heed outside forces which tried all means to prevent me from getting appointed.
 
 
 
 
 I believe that if there is an honest police inspector in town, there won’t be any thieves. I will increasingly work towards a corruption-free bureaucracy by focusing on maladministration and irregularities by putting in an effective Lokayukta system to deal with day-to-day complaints of corruption. I will look to prioritize my work, based on the feedback I get from the public. My work will thrive on the aspirations of the common man. 
 
 
 
 
 My immediate focus will be to strengthen the Lokayukta institution and bring it back to its glory. I will look to function as a team by taking the   and others in the institution into confidence. I will also bring in transparency to restore the faith of the common man in the institution.
 
 
 
 
 Not at all. Each Lokayukta was different and had their own style of functioning. I will work in my own way, instead of being a copycat. I believe in team work and I don’t want to take on any biggies just for fame. I am a man who will rise to the occasion and work in my own style.
 
 
 
 
 Yes, definitely. The Karnataka Lokayukta Act is hailed as one of the most effective and best in the country. Many states have emulated our Act, including the Lokpal mooted by the UPA government. I don’t see any reason why the institution will become weak without police powers.
