The first reaction of director   when he heard about what happened with a popular South Indian   in Kochi on Friday night — when she was   and allegedly sexually assaulted — was shock.

 "This is very shocking. The fear is that if this can happen to a celebrity, then what about the common man? I don’t know the details, but it seems to be personal vengeance in play. She is a very good girl, and it’s unfortunate that something like this happened to her. I have seen many heroines, and no one is as well behaved as her. The actress is innocent, and it is hard to believe that someone could have a personal grudge against her. She’s not the kind of a person to hurt anyone."
