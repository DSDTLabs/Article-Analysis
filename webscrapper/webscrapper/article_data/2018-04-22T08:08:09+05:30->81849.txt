KOLKATA:   once again showed that they are the most explosive team in Powerplay overs while their bowlers have proved to be the most economical in the death overs in   11.   cashed in on these two aspects of their game to crush Kolkata Knight Riders by nine wickets in a rain-truncated match here on Saturday and took the top spot on the points table.

 
 
 
 It was their fourth win this season - their first at the Eden Gardens since 2012. The win took KXIP to the top of the points table with eight points from five matches. Chasing KKRâ€™s imposing tally of 191/7, the visitors rattled up 96 runs without loss in just 8.2 overs when a sharp shower stopped play. But by then   and   had done enough damage and put the game beyond the hapless Knights. For the record, KXIP had logged 31 runs more than the par score under D/L method at that stage.
 
 
 
 Post a 95-minute rain-break, the match was reduced to 13 overs and the winning target was revised to 125 runs under D/L Method. The Punjab outfit reached the target in 11.1 overs losing the wicket of Rahul, who made a sparkling 60 off only 27 balls with nine fours and two sixes. Barely two days after hitting the first century of IPL 11, Gayle once again was at his rampaging best as he tore into the KKR attack and remained unbeaten on 62 that came off just 38 balls with the help of five fours and six sixes.
 
 Earlier, in spite of both Sunil Narine and Russell failing with the bat, KKR managed to put up a challenging total after being put into bat by KXIP captain R Ashwin who won the toss on a hot and humid afternoon.
 
 After offspinner Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman picked up Narine in his first over, Chris Lynn took up the challenge and fired on all cylinders. The Australian hit left-arm pacer Barinder Sran for two sixes and one four after Robin Uthappa had opened his account with a six in the eighth over that yielded 23 runs.
