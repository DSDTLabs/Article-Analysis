Coimbatore: These days, whenever a youngster is asked what are his hobbies, pat comes the answer, listening to music, watching films and playing games.

 As the king of hobbies - philately - slowly loses its patrons, other collection hobbies such as coin, currency, match box, bird feathers, posters, cards have not just become few but rare.
 
 “Gone are the days when people used to collect trump cards, cricket cards and anything new for time pass. It used to be a passion that drove them to look for specific items and increase the collection. Some people would just collect key chains and some tea cups,” said Som Ghatak, philatelist and post crosser.
 
 K Naseer Ahmed said that people are not even aware of real hobbies anymore. “In the age of mobile and computers, people do not have time and patience to collect anything. Such hobbies not just increased our knowledge and helped us learn so much about our history and country but also helped us interact with our peers,” he said.
 
 Rajesh C, a key chain collector, said that his parents used to write letters to friends across the globe via ‘pen pal’. “They would learn about the country and make friends as well. Many of us have even visited these pals in their cities,” he said.
 
 Ham radio was another hobby that people used to interact with the outer world. “These hobbies were our only way to connect to the outer world. But now internet and social media in particular has taken over. But the conversations on these medium has nothing to do with personal communication. People use it to either show off their achievements or troll people. Real communication does not happen anymore,” said Ranjith R, a businessman.
 
 City-based psychologists also pointed out that while their hobbies let them open up and become extrovert, the present ones only isolate people and make them introvert.
