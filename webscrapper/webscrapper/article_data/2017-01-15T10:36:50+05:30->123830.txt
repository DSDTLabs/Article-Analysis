BENGALURU: One morning in the first week of December, Shruthi had gone for a bath. A   on her iphone read ‘chinna.. what are you doing?' ('my dear...what are you doing?') It was from an unknown number and Rakesh couldn't read the entire message as the screen was locked. But he guessed it was than Amith. 

 “The sender's number was displayed on the screen and Rajesh noted it down. A few days later, Rajesh asked a friend to call that number from a coin-booth phone and ask for some Srinivas," sources said.
 
 According to Rajesh, his friend followed the instructions. A male voice said 'Wrong number' and disconnected the call," an investigating officer said.
 
 “This led Rajesh to believe that Shruthi was still meeting Amith. In the second week of December, he tried to follow her car, but was caught by Shruthi who was upset that he suspected her fidelity," police sources said.
 
 Once, Rajesh, who was following Shruthi's vehicle on a motor bike, stopped on seeing her car parked outside a school near Bagalagunte.“Rajesh went near the car and at the same time, Shruthi, who was standing near a bakery, reached the car. She fought with Rajesh, asking him why he was following her,“ police sources said.
