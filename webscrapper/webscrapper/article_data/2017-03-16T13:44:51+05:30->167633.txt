MANDYA: A woman police officer allegedly roughed up two youths for not wearing helmets on the   highway at   village near   on Tuesday. 

 SI Savi reportedly attacked the youths in public and this behaviour has antagonized people. According to eyewitnesses, the SI and other police personnel were checking motorists for traffic violations. Nagashimha and Nishant, residents of   village, were stopped for not wearing helmets. Instead of fining them as per the rules, Savi is said to have abused them and the angry youths responded in kind.
 
 Savi then grabbed one youth by his collar and slapped him twice on the cheek. She then brought them to the police station where she filed charges of obstructing a government official from doing her duty.
 
 Some onlookers captured the incident on their cellphones and uploaded the clip on social media platforms. The youths said they had paid the fine of Rs 100 for not wearing helmets, they were abused and thrashed. They added that they may file a complaint against the officer.
 
 A senior police officer said Savi was at fault and an inquiry would determine what provoked her to misbehave with the youths. If she is found guilty, she should be punished. TOI tried to contact SP Sudheerkumar Reddy several times but he did not take the calls.
