GURUGRAM: The   has decided not to allow registration for the properties, which have taxes pending.

 MCG officials said they informed the tehsil office last month, asking it not to allow any property registration unless the file comes with a no objection certificate from corporation with regards to the payment of property taxes.
 
 “In order to ensure higher compliance with regard to   payments, we have asked officials at the tehsil office not to register any property, be it land or a building, unless its taxes have been paid,” said Y S Gupta, additional municipal commissioner, Gurgaon.
 
 Additionally, MCG has placed its own officers in the tehsil office, one per zone, to ensure the implementation of the order. In case anyone wishes to clear the   to obtain the NOC, they can do so by submitting a demand draft with the MCG officials at the tehsil office. “We have made arrangements for our team to collect the taxes if anyone is willing to pay,” said Gupta.
 
 Land registrations are required for new properties and even in cases of resale. MCG’s move comes after a series of steps against property tax defaulters in the city. 
 
 In the last one year, the corporation has seen a more than 100% increase in its property tax collection. While the property tax collection for the period of December 2015 to December 2016 was recorded at Rs. 177.40 crore, the tax collection for December 2016 to December 2017 was recorded at Rs.378.29 crore.
 
 The percentage increase in the collection comes to around 114%, which is probably the highest collection ever, according to officials.
