Mysuru: Although they exist to streamline vehicular movement, and ensure safety of road users, traffic signals at major junctions in the city have turned into major hurdles for motorists and pedestrians alike.

 While many roads in the heart of the city were widened and asphalted,   at Ramaswamy Circle, Siddappa Square and the junction of New Kantharaj Urs Road and Krishnaraja Boulevard, were not shifted accordingly, much to the chagrin of road users. Consequently, road users have reaped no benefits of the road-widening projects since the position of the traffic light poles skews the width of these arterial streets. Besides, the poles have also turned into safety hazards since they are practically invisible at night. 
 
 JLB Road was widened a year ago, but the traffic pole that ought to have been shifted to ensure it now remained at the centre, was left where it was. To make matters worse, traffic police are yet to take cognisance of this problem. Fortunately, there have been no tragic incidents at any of these junctions, which are counted among the busiest in the city. Interestingly, most of these junctions are equipped with closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, which would inform the authorities concerned about the problem on these roads, and yet the problem persists.
 
 While the island on which the signal pole was installed at Siddappa Square was removed when road-widening work was under way, it was not moved once work was completed, turning it into an extremely perilous spot for road users, the situation is no better near the railway under bridge in Chamarajapuram.
 
 When TOI brought the problem to the notice of City police commissioner A Subramanyeshwar Rao, he promised to shift these poles.
