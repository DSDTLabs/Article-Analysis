NEW DELHI: The much-awaited verdict in the disproportionate assets case, in which   is 
  , is unlikely to be pronounced by the   on Monday, prolonging the political uncertainty in Tamil Nadu. The SC cause list — which catalogues the court’s business for the day — does not mention the case for Monday.

 Significantly, one of the two judges on the bench doesn’t figure on the cause list, though it was not clear whether he is on leave or has taken the day off to finish writing the   case order.
 
 Justice P C Ghose and Justice Amitava Roy, who last year reserved the verdict, had indicated on February 6 that the order could be delivered in a week.
 
 As the court developments are being keenly awaited, there are indications that the Centre may not want the TN governor to get into the business of assessing claims of the Sasikala and   camps. Indications are that the Centre might want the governor to allow the claims of majority to be settled on the floor of the assembly: a course which will be in harmony with the SC’s verdicts in similar cases.
 
 The impending verdict is seen to be the reason for governor Vidyasagar Rao’s 
  to swear in Sasikala as chief minister as an adverse ruling could mean she will be barred from contesting elections and, hence, becoming a legislator.
