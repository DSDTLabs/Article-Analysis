  The dalits had decided not to dispose of carcasses after they were not allowed to sit with members of other communities at a feast in a temple.
 
 Amrut Rathod, 52, a skinner from dalit community, approached the police on Friday to lodge a complaint. He said there was a feast at   temple on February 8 and 9 where dalits were asked to sit in a separate group. 
 
 “Hurt by this, the dalits told others that they would either sit in the common group during the feast or they would not join the feast. After that, the other community members cancelled the feast for dalits,” Rathod said.
 
 “On Thursday, we were told to remove a dead cow but as we were hurt by the bad treatment given to us, we refused to do the job. After that, they announced that no one will have any financial or social dealing with dalits,” Rathod said.
