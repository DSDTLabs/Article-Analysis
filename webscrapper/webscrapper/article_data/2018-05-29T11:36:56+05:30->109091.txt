THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   Vijayan condemned the murder of abducted youth   on Monday saying that it should not have happened in a state like Kerala. The government would take strict action in this case and that no culprit would be spared. The state police chief would take action if it is found that police officers failed to do their job, said the chief minister.

 
 Already four special squads comprising the crime branch and local police had been constituted for the investigation (two each in Kollam and Kottayam). The IG would oversee the investigation, he added.
 
 On the reports that the police did not act initially as they were providing security to the chief minister during his Kottayam visit, Vijayan said: “It is unfortunate that the chief minister’s security is being linked to this incident. A special team provides security to the chief minister and neither the SI nor the CI have to provide security for the chief minister. Police should know how to take up responsibilities and chief minister’s visit should not be an excuse,” said Vijayan.
 
 State police chief Loknath Behera expressed his shock and said this was unexpected in Kerala and it should not have happened. He promised action against police officers if they failed to do their duties.
 
 Meanwhile, national commission for minorities has asked Behera, the district collector and police superintendents of Kottayam and Kollam to submit reports within seven days.
