New Delhi: In a first, Delhi   ( ) will be leasing   to cater to the growing rush of passengers.

 Delhi Metro caters to 28 lakh passengers daily and the numbers are only growing. To meet the rush and run trains at increased frequency — particularly during peak hours — DMRC needs more trains. Till date, DMRC had only purchased trains — a time-consuming process that also needs substantial investment.
 
 The corporation is now exploring the possibility of taking trains on lease instead of purchasing them and the Inderlok-Mundka (line 5) corridor will be the first section where the leased trains will be deployed. DMRC is looking for companies that are capable of supplying trains and, if this new plan works, it will take more trains on lease for its other corridors. The leasing firm will also have to maintain the trains. DMRC will pay rental charges (on per hour basis) depending on the trains’ availability.
 
 At first DMRC will take on lease 150 coaches, which will be converted into 25 six-coach train sets. At present, DMRC has deployed 23 trains on this corridor, out of which one is a six-coach train and the rest are all four-coach trains. The present rolling stock on this corridor was procured from   and the firm that will provide trains on lease will have to follow the same specifications in the train as the existing ones.
 
 “We are exploring this option and will further extend it to other corridors only if it proves to be financially viable,” said a DMRC spokesperson.
