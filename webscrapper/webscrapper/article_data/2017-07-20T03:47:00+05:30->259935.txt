Patna: Amid mounting pressure from chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) to come clean in the land-for-railway hotels case, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son and deputy chief minister   Prasad Yadav left for Delhi on Wednesday to seek legal opinion and challenge in the court the FIR lodged by the CBI against him and his family members. 

 Though Tejashwi’s office maintained that he would review the construction work of a the new Bihar Bhawan building at Dwarka in his capacity of building construction department minister and may meet Union minister of road transport and highway Nitin Gadkari as the deputy CM is also the minister of the department in Bihar, a close confidante of Lalu family said, “Tejashwi’s lawyers have told him to challenge the FIR in the court to get it quashed. In case the court does not give him a favourable decision, he will move for an anticipatory bail.” 
 
 Tejashwi, along with his father Lalu and mother Rabri Devi among others, is accused of ‘criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal misconduct’ in an alleged land deal when the RJD chief was the rail minister.
 
 “Lalu has decided that mere FIR is not a strong reason for Tejashwi’s resignation. However, it is almost certain that Tejashwi will resign once the CBI chargesheets him in the case or he is arrested,” an RJD functionary said.
