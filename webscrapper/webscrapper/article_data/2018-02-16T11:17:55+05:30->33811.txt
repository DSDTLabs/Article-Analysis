 The medical miracle that put Aasif back on his feet began with a stroke of luck: the cardiac arrest happened inside the hospital while doctors were examining him for acute chest pain. As soon as he collapsed, trauma specialists kept the blood supply running by administering continuous cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shock to the heart using a defibrillator.
 
 His heart revived after more than an hour.

Doctors had no choice but to conduct the angiogram, remove the clot and place a stent in the vessel while administering CPR.
