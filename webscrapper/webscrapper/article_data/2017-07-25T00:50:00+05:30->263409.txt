Udhagamandalam: The Nilgiri Documentation Centre ( ), in a letter to the   collector, has listed top 10 priorities of the hill district.

 Stating that around 25 lakh tourists visit the hill district a year and the visitors do not pay a paise for the hill towns’ upkeep, the letter recommended a ‘town betterment levy’.
 
 Other priorities include development of infrastructure including drainage, roads, waste disposal and drinking water. “Charing Cross, the market and the two government hospitals deserve immediate attention. Forest and horticulture departments had been the main beneficiaries of fund allocation and tourism was ignored. Tourism and municipal needs should get due priority under the Special Area Development Programme (SADP),” the letter said.
 
 Honorary director of NDC Venugopal Dharmalingam said the forest department should be persuaded to spare land for waste disposal and traffic management projects.
 
 The district gets no benefit for keeping 56% of its land under forest category, he said. “Boarding schools and hotels are the major beneficiaries of the towns. They should be persuaded to contribute to the upkeep of the towns”.
 
 The other priorities to be considered include parking and preventive action to save Kotagiri hills from overexploitation. “Modern Nilgiris will be 200 years old in January 2019. The unique history deserves to be showcased in the Tribal Resources Centre,” the letter added.
