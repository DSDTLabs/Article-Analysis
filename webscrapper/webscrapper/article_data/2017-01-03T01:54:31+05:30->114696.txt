NEW DELHI: To   the existing   in south Delhi to a double flyover and accommodate additional traffic once the Metro station at the Savitri turn towards GK-II opens, PWD will require to expand the   at this juncture. 

 PWD will, on behalf of Delhi government, fund a survey of the road which will be undertaken by the local SDM.
 
 “There is one gas depot, a couple of offices etc on this road which have already been declared illegal in a previous survey. Since there has been dispute over this claim, we have requested for another survey to be undertaken for which a report will be submitted within a week or so. The portion of the road in question is a major bottleneck and residents have been demanding action against encroachment for several months,” said Saurabh Bharadwaj, GK MLA.
 
 A senior PWD official said that there are two possibilities if the identified constructions were found to be encroachments. “If the land is theirs but the construction is found to have been carried out on the right of way, the concerned parties will be paid adequate compensation and then the encroachment will be razed. If it is an outright encroachment with no right to the land, the buildings will be removed without any compensation,” said the official.
 
 The directions issued in a recent meeting between the MLA, PWD and residents said: “SDM Kalkaji will carry out the survey. It will also be cross checked from the consultant who has developed the proposal for the flyover.”
 
 Chetan Sharma, chairman of the federation of GK-II complex RWAs, said that the flyover itself would take at least two years to come up but the Metro station is likely to be ready by April or May. “This will further constrict the road and when the construction on the flyover starts, this road will become unusable,” he said.
