CHARMINAR: Centre’s move to scrap   subsidy will not affect pilgrims in the state, the Telangana State Haj Committee said here on Wednesday.

 The Telangana State Haj Committee, special officer, SA   explained that while the departure from Hyderabad embarkation point will not be affected but they might have to contend with increased airfare this year.
 
 “As far as the Hyderabad embarkation point is concerned, pilgrims from states of Telangana,   and the Karnataka will not be affected.
 
 Though last year, the airfare was fixed around ₹60,023 for pilgrims at the Hyderabad embarkation point, due to slab subsidy, our Haj pilgrims were charged ₹62,065.
 
 “Thus, state Haj pilgrims were not given any subsidy in 2017,” clarified SA Shukoor.
 
 Earlier the Supreme Court had ordered scrapping of Haj subsidy by 2022, he added. In 2012, the subsidy on fare ticket was released at around ₹700 crore. Later, it was reduced to ₹405 crore in 2017. Similarly, last year only ₹200 crore subsidy was released.
 
 The Centre said the decision to cut subsidy was part of its agenda for empowerment of minorities without appeasement.
 
 The decision is a political signal as well, BJP has argued that the subsidy, essential for air travel, is a demonstrative sop for Muslims and a diversion of funds might be better utilised.The decision did not evoke a protest from  , which maintained it has no objections as long as the funds were utilised for minority welfare.
