LUCKNOW: The school where a class I student was stabbed on Tuesday has allegedly encroached a large part of a public park. 

 Brightland Inter College in   uses Lucknow Municipal Corporation's  , located next to the school, in Mousam Bagh Colony for parking its students' vehicles. 
 
    claimed it had written to police and the principal several times for removing the encroachment but they never took action. LMC's park superintendent for trans-Gomti Rajeev   said, "We have removed the encroachment many times, most recently two months ago, but the school re-occupied the place each time. Despite repeated reminders, there is no compliance." 
 
 Residents of the area also expressed their anger. 
 
 PK Gupta, a retired secretariat employee, said, "We are never able to use the park though it is run by LMC. The school uses it forcefully for illegal parking of vehicles of its students and staff. LMC rarely visits the park for removal of encroachment."
 
 RK Shrivastava, another resident, said LMC does not maintain the park. 
 
 The school management was unavailable for comments but its discipline in charge   said the park was being used with the consent of residents.
