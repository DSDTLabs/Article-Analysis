HYDERABAD: Cases of anaemia in women, including severe anaemia, have been on a constant rise in the state, points out a report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India ( ). As per the report, cases of anaemia increased from 1.42 lakh in 2012-13 to 2.93 lakh in 2016-17.

 The issue came to light last year during an uproar over a string of maternal deaths reported at the state-run Government Maternity hospital Petlaburj. Authorities said it was impossible to save the women, due to their haemoglobin counts being as low as 3-5 grams.
 
 “Anaemia is considered the leading cause of maternal mortality.   (RCH) programme under   ( ) emphasised administration of IFA tablets for pregnant women for a period of 100 days. During 2012-17, state health societies (SHS) reported that 41. 93 lakh pregnant women registered for antenatal checkups. In 2012-15, 97 per cent of women were given tablets. All women who went to the centres were given tablets during 2015-17. But anaemia cases increased from 1.42 lakh in 2012-13 to 2.93 lakh in 2016-17,” read the report.
 
 Similarly, cases of severe anaemia also increased from 11,373 cases in 2012-13 to 14,848 cases in 2016-17 with the maximum of 28,182 cases being recorded during 2015-16. In three sampled districts, it was seen that the shortfall in administration of IFA tablets ranged from 2 to 19 per cent. In   district, cases of severe anaemia increased drastically from 109 cases in 2012-13 to 2121 cases in 2016-17 despite the administration of tablets.
 
 While reasons for increase in cases of severe anaemia were not stated by state government, the CAG noted, “These public health measures were essential for enhanced maternal and child survival and lower RCH morbidity. While the govt replied that previously pregnant women were given only100 IFA tablets during pregnancy but from 2016-17 all the pregnant women received 180 tablets women with and moderate to severe anaemia were given double the dosage, the reply is not acceptable as the rise in anaemic cases during the period was contrary to the claim made by government,” as per the report.
