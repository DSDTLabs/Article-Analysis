BHOPAL: Three people were killed in a clash between neighbours in remote village in Satna district on Monday night. The clash broke out between two families after a man identified as Manendra   was allegedly murdered by one Ehsaan   over a petty dispute. The incident took place at Rimari village of the district at around 6.30 pm. After the incident, Mishra’s family set Ehsaan’s house on fire. Later two charred bodies were recovered from the house. Efforts are being made to identify the bodies. 

 Cops have been deployed in the village in large number to take control on the situation as more than 5000 people gathered at the spot. Police managed to douse the fire and extricate the two charred bodies from the house. “The bodies are yet to be identified. It was a clash between two neighbours over some petty dispute related to hay. The situation in the village is under control and it is not a group or communal clash,” Satna SP Rajesh Hingarkar told TOI. Sources, however, said that it is being suspected that two people were murdered and after their house was set afire the bodies were thrown into it.
