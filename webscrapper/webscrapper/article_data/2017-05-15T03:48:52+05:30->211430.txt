 The community hall was constructed in 2012 after government sanctioned money following the demand of   and they used it for personal celebrations and gatherings. In October last year, the building situated right in front of Pund’s house, registered as a community hall got converted to a temple, informed the villagers in a press conference at   on Saturday. 
 
 They said, “We are not against temples. In fact, we are ready to contribute to formally construct one in the available space in our area. But the Sarpanch has a hell-bent attitude which leaves us deprived of our requirements. This is unlawful usage of government’s property for religious purpose.”
 
 The villagers also approached the  , collector, guardian minister, divisional commissioner but no fruitful results were obtained. They also pointed a finger at Gram Panchayat’s Secretary Bannegare. 
 
 Chicholi has a population of around 1200 people and they plan to conduct a Morcha in front of Hingna Tehsil Office if their demands are turned a deaf ear.
