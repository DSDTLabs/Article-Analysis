VARANASI: A day after a man from Ghaziabad sent a demand draft of Rs 100 to   vice president   for getting his   stitched, a local lawyer, on Thursday, also sent Rs 100 with a letter to him for the same.

 Dinesh Kumar Dixit, practicing at the district session court, sent the amount attached with a letter to Rahul. In his letter Dixit said that he came to know about his torn kurta during Rishikesh rally through media. “It shows the poverty you (Rahul) are facing after demonetisation and managing your expenditure including foreign trip with the money you had exchanged by standing in the queue,” wrote Dixit in a mocking tone. 
 
 In a meeting in Uttarakhand, Rahul had shown that the pocket of his kurta was torn, saying, “Mera pocket/kurta phata ho toh mujhe farak nahi padta, lekin Modi ji ka kapda kabhi nahi phata hoga aur vo gareeb ki rajneeti karte hain” (My kurta pocket is torn, and that doesn’t matter to me. But you will never see Modi ji wearing torn clothes, despite the fact that he claims to represent the poor in politics).
