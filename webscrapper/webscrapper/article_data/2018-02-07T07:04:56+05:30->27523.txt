AHMEDABAD: At a time when   — be it that of vegetables or food grains or even cosmetics and clothing — is promoted, a study conducted by   (CERC) reveals the dark truth about the   we consume. The findings of the study suggested that traces of pesticides and heavy metals were found in samples of organic vegetables – spinach and fenugreek sourced from various places in Ahmedabad. Seven of the nine samples of these organic leafy greens were found to contain chemicals – two with pesticide residues including chlorpyrifos and parathion methyl while five with heavy metals – copper and lead.

  
  Ironically, non-organic counterparts tested by CERC did not find any pesticide residues, states the study, while presence of heavy metals was still detected in non-organic varieties as well, albeit in lesser quantities.
 
  
  “Consumers pay a premium for organic vegetables as they are expensive – nearly double the price of non-organic vegetables. Such malpractices are indeed a big let-down for the   as you never expect traces of any form of chemicals in the vegetables. At the same time, it reflects the absence of regulations to ensure the quality,” said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, CERC.
 
 Both these pesticides as well as heavy metals have adverse health implications, especially on children. Rinsing reduces pesticides on the surface of vegetables, but it can’t remove those that are absorbed by the roots and make their way into the plant’s tissue states the study. “Pesticide residues and even heavy metals – even though in lower quantities – are particularly harmful for children and the elderly,” states the study.
 
 In the wake of the findings, CERC has called for lifting the exemptions given to direct sales of organic produce by small farmers and producer organisations to the end-consumer by Food Safety and Standards (Organic Food) Regulations 2017.
