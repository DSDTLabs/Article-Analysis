CHANDIGARH: Despite the Punjab and   high court on Tuesday scrapping   for admission to 125 seats for MD/MS in the   ( ), Sector 32, and ordering a fresh one, parents and students who won the case alleged they were not counselled.

 They raised slogans and alleged officials were not complying with the court’s order as they did not declare how many seats are under state quota now. “It seems it’s a manipulation to fit in students of the college despite the court’s order,” alleged a parent of a candidate. However, no official was available for comment from GMCH.
 
 The admission of the seats was through the NEET followed by three counselling sessions. The first counselling started on April 4 after a candidate, Dr Chahat Bhatia, was found ineligible to apply from state quota as she was not a pass-out of GMCH. She moved the court and was allowed to take part in counselling as an interim order.
 
 On May 10, while the decision of the high court was pending, some of the students at GMCH approached the apex court. The   referred the case back to the high court. “The college has been giving 100% seats to the institution, which is nowhere in the country. The court decided in our favour and directed to have 25% seats for domicile of Chandigarh and 25% for those who have passed from GMCH,” said one of the 11 petitioners.
 
 Out of the 125 seats, 61 seats are for the state, including the institution. “But it has not been informed how many seats have been surrendered from the institution to the state. We were also told that the GMCH officials have decided to appeal in the Supreme Court,” said a student.
 
 Till the filing of this report, a meeting with the GMCH officials was on and no decision on the new schedule was taken.
