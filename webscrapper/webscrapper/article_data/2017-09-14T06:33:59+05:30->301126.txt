NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday said funds released by the Centre to states under the   Livelihoods Mission (NULM) needed to be audited as more than Rs 2,000 crore had been given to states in the last three years but they had failed to construct   for the  . 

 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said auditing should be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to find out how the money was spent by the state governments. It asked solicitor general Ranjit Kumar to take instructions from the Centre on how the auditing should be done.
 
 The court said governments must ensure that welfare funds given by the Centre were not used for any other purpose. The court passed the order on the basis of a report filed by apex court-appointed panel headed by a former Delhi High Court judge. As per the report, more than 90 percent of urban homeless had no roof over their heads as state governments had pathetically failed in setting up shelters despite the Centre giving huge funds under NULM which was launched in 2013.
 
 The three-member committee, headed by Justice (Rtd) Kailash Gambhir said governments were not using the funds released by the Centre for construction of shelter homes and homeless people in urban centres were forced to live by the roadside, railway platforms and under flyovers.
 
 Lack of shelter leads to unnatural death of many homeless people in extreme weather conditions like cold and heat waves as they are forced to live a life under the open sky. The apex court has been monitoring implementation of NULM since 2013 and has repeatedly expressed concern over “an extremely unsatisfactory state of affairs on the ground”.
