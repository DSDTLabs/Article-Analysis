Mysuru: Although reactions to the rollout of the   (GST) have been mixed, commerce graduates in the city appear to have no cause for complaint. As companies and businesses prepare to adapt to the new system, commerce students, adept at handling taxes appear to be in great demand.

 Professor B Nagaraju, head of the department, faculty of commerce, University of Mysore (UoM), pointed out that there never was a dearth of opportunities for commerce students. “Naturally, this year, the new tax regime has increased the number of openings for students. But the key factor is the performance of students in the workplace,” he added.

 Raghottam C Bhat, who is working with several recruiters from Bengaluru, said, “Knowledge of any accounting software appears to be enough to get a job this year. I have helped get several fresh BCom graduates get a job with a great package in Bengaluru. Experience is not an issue. GST has changed the fortunes of those with one to two years of experience. Freshers are being offered much better salaries this year.”
