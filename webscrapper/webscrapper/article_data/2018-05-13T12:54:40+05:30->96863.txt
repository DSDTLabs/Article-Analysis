TRICHY: At a time when government schools are only being upgraded with computer labs, smart classrooms, libraries and better facilities, it would be surprising to know that the   middle school at Mangudi in   had it all a decade ago. The infrastructure development could be achieved by the school with the support of local people and the parents. 

 Similarly, an overwhelming response for admissions at the government primary school at Othakadai in Madurai district forced it to seek police help to admit students in the last academic year. It is the exceptional coaching offered by the school which has made it much sought-after. Another school which falls in this bracket is the panchayat union primary school at   in Karur district which is way ahead of any government school on many aspects ensuring holistic learning for children. 
 
 These three schools were chosen as model schools by Kalviyaalargal Sangamam at its annual meeting at   of engineering on Saturday. The government schools were found to be ahead of their counterparts in the state in terms of performance by the organisation. Kalviyaalargal Sangamam is a three-year-old organization with over 650 like-minded people, especially teachers. It also rewarded 82 teachers from government schools for their dedicated service.
 
 Schools are selected for the award based on media reports and inquiries, said its state organiser, C  . “Same is the case with the award for teachers also as we don’t call for entries from them,” he said. All Farmers Associations' Coordination Committee P R Pandian, who was the chief guest of the event, said that people had more faith in teachers than doctors or other professionals
