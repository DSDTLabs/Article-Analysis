He also accused Congress of spreading “lies and rumours” on issues ranging from dilution of anti-Dalit atrocities law, reservation and levying GST on share farming. 

 
 In an all-out attack on Congress,   said those who worshipped a family could not worship democracy. “The truth is that they neither had faith in democracy nor in institutions run as per constitutional provisions. In the past four years, their mentality has been exposed time and again. They created an atmosphere of distrust on the apex court of the country. The country knows how they raised doubts on the impartiality of Election Commission and functioning of EVMs. They even raised questions on the policies of RBI and created an atmosphere of distrust,” he said. 
 
 Referring to an order of the apex court on SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the PM said, “People have seen how they are spreading lies over an order of the Supreme Court for their narrow political gains.” Modi was addressing a rally in Baghpat after inaugurating the Rs 11,000 crore Eastern Peripheral Expressway. “They (Congress) even dismiss the courage of Indian Army, which carried out surgical strikes. In opposing Modi, they have started opposing the country,” the PM said.
 
 Highlighting the government’s focus on building infrastructure, Modi said such facilities did not distinguish between caste, religion, faith and class. “Infrastructure creates equal opportunities for all,” he said. The PM also hit out at the newly formed coalition of opposition parties and said people would see through their design. “Who are there on the other side and who are on this side. For them, their family is their country. For me, my country is my family,” he added.
