CHANDIGARH: Teaching departments in   are going to set up a committees of peers to   being offered in their respective departments. This is the first time an exercise where peers will review the courses will be taken up at the University. The Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) of the University has written to departments and chairpersons to start the review exercise. It will include aspects like the length of the course and whether the different courses impart skills that will be of use to students in the future. 

 “This time we are asking departments to conduct in-depth and critical review of their courses. We peers or stakeholders to review courses, instead of the regular exercise of faculty members evaluating their respective courses themselves. This will help us ascertain the social worth and academic aspect of different courses,” said IQAC director Prof M Rajivlochan. 
 
 The exercise is in consonance with PU’s aim of emerging as a world class university and as one of the best teaching and research universities in the country, said Rajivlochan. Course review is generally done in the University every three years. This is the first time that peers will review courses being offered at different teaching departments of the University. 
 
 Evaluation will be done by all stakeholders, including members of society so that social worth of the courses is explored and changes suggested accordingly. “Our new vision is that Panjab University should be slotted as a world-class institution. To do that, we are asking departments what changes they would suggest in the department,” said Rajivlochan, elaborating in the purpose of review of courses. 
 
 Peer review of a course will involve a committee of peers conducting in-depth evaluation of courses. The exercise will require each department to set up their own parameters to evaluate courses offered.
