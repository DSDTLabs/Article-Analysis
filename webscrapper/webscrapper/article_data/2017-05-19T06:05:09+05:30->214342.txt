SURAT: The   ( ) has revived the plan to shift its head office from   in the old city. 

 Two-and-a-half years ago former CM Anandi Patel had laid a foundation stone for the project at old sub-jail on the ring road, which was later scrapped due to technical issues. Now, the SMC has identified three sites based on traffic congestion and accessibility survey. One of them will be finalized for constructing its new 60-storeyed head office. 
 
 After reviving the plans to shift, SMC had invited expression of interest (EoIs) and 16 parties from across India had shown interest. 
 
 “We are conducting a study for the location which is easily accessible and has minimum traffic congestion as the new office would be a sky scrapper. Once that is over we will present it to the standing committee to decide on the final spot selection,” said municipal commissioner M Thennarasan. He said that the new head office will be a 60-storeyed building.
 
 The three locations finalized include sub-jail spot acquired from state government on ring road, land near   road on   and a place near Indoor Stadium. 
 
 The SMC’s requirement for construction is minimum of 20,000 sq m and all the three plots fulfil the basic requirement. 
 
 It must be noted that, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion, SMC had decided to construct a sky scrapper as its new head office. A Chinese company had approached SMC and proposed to build the building in 60-75 days with new technology. 
 
 However, the costing proposed was too high. So, SMC decided not to take up the project. Hence, after stone laying ceremony the project was scrapped and revived again this year.
