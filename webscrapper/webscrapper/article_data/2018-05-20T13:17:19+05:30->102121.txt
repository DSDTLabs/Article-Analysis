SURAT: A report submitted by education department to Free Regulation Committee ( ) about south zone of   had revealed that a total of 661 schools of the region were yet to comply with the Supreme Court’s directives on school fees issue.

  The panel has issued notices to 350 schools for failing to adhere to rules and not completing the procedure while it plans to issue notices to the remaining schools by Tuesday. The FRC instructed the district education office to submit details of schools that had not completed the formalities on fee fixation after TOI highlighted this. The schools are supposed to submit affidavits that they are collecting fees within the highest limit fixed by the state government. Schools that want to collect fees above a specific limit must submit a proposal and seek permission. Only after the FRC’s review and approval can the schools charge higher fees. 
 
 So far over 1,700 schools of the region have submitted affidavits and around 130 schools proposals. The education department on May 3 was unable to provide the number of schools that were yet to comply to the rules. TOI raised the issue and district education department was instructed by chairman of the committee Justice A M Dave to find out about such schools.
 
 “The schools were supposed to comply with the Supreme Court’s directives by March 21. But 661 schools are yet to complete the procedures and hence we issued notices to 350 schools. Notices will be issued to the remaining schools by Tuesday. The schools have been instructed to reply in a week’s time. If they fail to do so, punitive action will be taken against them,” FRC member   said.
