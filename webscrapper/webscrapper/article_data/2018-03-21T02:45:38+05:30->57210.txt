NEW DELHI: With University Grants Commission granting full   to 62 higher educational institutions, Jawaharlal Nehru University will be free to decide its own admission procedure, fee structure and curriculum, and can even expand outside and create new campuses. 

 According to former   Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) secretary Bikramaditya Choudhury, JNU always has academic autonomy as “we design and draft our own curriculum. But with this decision, the government has given us financial autonomy as well. This will mean that the university may move towards privatisation.” 
 
 Resonating his fears, the current JNUTA secretary, Sudhir Kumar Suthar, said the decision would kill social justice in the university. Granting autonomy will mean that the state will “withdraw its obligations for universities to be spaces of social justice”, he added. “With a university looking at self-financed courses to meet its financial needs, social justice takes a back seat, something for which JNU was formed.” 
 
 This decision will make the JNU vice-chancellor “a manager and not a servant of the public” and interests of the marginalised section may be compromised, said Suthar.
