CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday ordered immediate closure of 729 defaulting shops in Koyambedu market due to ‘deliberate failure’ of the   to collect   to the tune of Rs 2.48 crore. 

  passed the interim order on a plea moved by the shop owners assailing the property tax demand made by the corporation from 1996 to 2015. 
 
 On November 17, 2016, the court passed an interim order directing the defaulters to pay the pending taxes immediately. Within 12 days of the order, the shop owners paid taxes to the tune of Rs 2.19 crore. 
 
 On Tuesday corporation officials said 1,596 of the 2,325 shops paid the property tax to the tune of over Rs 3 crore as on June 29. Only remaining 729 shop owners are still defaulting the payment which amounts to Rs 2.48 crore. 
 
 Recording the submissions, justice Kirubakaran said, “It is pertinent to note that the property tax sought to be collected from the shop owners in Koyambedu is not the  , as the last tax revision took place only in the year 1998.
 
  As per the provision of the City  , 1919, the property tax had to be revised once in four years and as per the said provision, four revisions should have taken place after the revision in the year 1998. However, the officials and the higher ups of the Chennai Corporation had deliberately failed and neglected to revise the tax for political gains. While so, even the non-revised 1998 rate property tax have not been paid by 729 shop owners.”
