VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh   on Friday said the   case in Visakhapatnam and the Vijayawada kidnap case were not linked to any hawala racket. 

 Rao said that the Vizag case will attract sections under Money Laundering Act and this was misleading people into believing there was an hawala angle. Both the CID and enforcement directorate (ED) are probing the issue.
 
 The DGP said there were 12 bank accounts and 14 shell companies in Kolkata, where 680 crore was laundered. The income tax officials are examining 42 more accounts. They have found that 533 crore was laundered from a single Canara Bank branch. "CID arrested nine people and identified 17 more people involved. We have sent lookout notices to all ports, airports and railway junctions to ensure that they do not leave the country," the DGP said.
