Vadodara: When Baroda District Hockey Association (BDHA) officials reached the hockey ground on the Rajmahal Road on Saturday, they were in for a shock. The entire ground was ploughed, the goalposts were removed and fences were cut off. 

 When the BDHA officials inquired, they got no replies. The ground’s condition left even the parents of the hockey players surprised. 
 
 “We were told that the royal Gaekwad family that owns the ground has ordered to plough the ground and remove the fences. We have been trying to reach out to the family but have got no response so far,” said Amardeep Singh, secretary, BDHA. 
 
 The ground was sealed in November last year after royal Gaekwad scion Samarjitsinh Gaekwad paid the pending taxes worth Rs 32 lakh to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). “The ground was sealed by the family and our entry has been barred since then. Our hockey students haven’t been able to practice there now,” Singh told TOI. 
 
 The BDHA and VMC had been at loggerheads over last few years over the tax issue. While VMC had asked BDHA to pay taxes as per commercial rates, BDHA had contended that it runs a sporting activity for a nominal fee and it is not a commercial activity. The VMC, however, kept sending notices for tax recovery and in November last year, it asked Gaekwad to pay the dues failing which the ground would be auctioned by the civic body. 
 
 “We met deputy mayor, deputy municipal commissioner and other VMC officials over last few weeks to resolve the issue. They promised to refund the amount Gaekwad has paid and not charge commercial rates if we get a letter from the royal family stating that BDHA runs a sporting activity on the ground. I have been trying to contact Samarjitsinh Gaekwad for last four days but to no avail,” Singh said. 
 
 Gaekwad wasn’t available for comments.
