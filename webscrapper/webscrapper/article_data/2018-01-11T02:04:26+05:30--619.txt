 MUMBAI: Thousands of litres of drinking water are actually going to the drain daily over several weeks from the main supply line located along MIDC arterial road that runs through slum pockets under Digha ward. 

 Authorities have turned a blind eye to massive water theft by the locals. Slum dwellers from Yadav Nagar, Devidham Nagar, Airoli Naka and   have been loosening the joint valve flange and bolts to steal water from the MIDC main line which supplies to parts of Navi Mumbai, Thane city and Mira-Bhayander, alleged eyewitnesses. 
 
 The residents of Digha apart from neighbouring   and Kalwa are complaining of low-pressure supply and reduced supply slot for the last few days. Motorists also find it an ideal place to wash their vehicles free of charge. “For several weeks, drinking water has been going down the drain as the pipeline has remained unplugged. Local slum dwellers are making good use of the 24x7 leakage. Old pipelines with lack of surveillance encourage these locals to tamper with the supply system” said an activist Dilip Mahajan. 
 
 Sanjay Desai, NMMC executive engineer said, “MIDC should plug the leakage spot which will help build pressure in the supply end.” Aresident,   said, “We have been watching for quite some time and this leads to low pressure in the supply tabs in the vicinity. A huge amount of drinking water is being wasted on daily basis. In the absence of any action, slum dwellers are brazenly connecting pipes to fill water tanks and barrels.” MIDC deputy engineer   said, “We have not come across the pilferage which may have occurred recently. 
 
 However, we will send our team to conceal the leakage areas at the soonest and warn the slum dwellers.”
