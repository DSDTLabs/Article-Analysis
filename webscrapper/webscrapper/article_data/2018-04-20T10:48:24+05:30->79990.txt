TRICHY: Farmers from across the delta district urged the state government to disburse the crop insurance claim due for the year 2016-17, as hundreds of farmers are yet to receive the same.

The eligible farmers were asked to approach the concerned agriculture offices to clear their doubts and status of their claim.

According to district administration, a total of 31,000 farmers have so far paid a premium to the tune of Rs 1.55 crore to insure their crops for the year 2017-18.
