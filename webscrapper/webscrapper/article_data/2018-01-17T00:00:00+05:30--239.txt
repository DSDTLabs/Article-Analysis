Pranitha’s latest pet destination is the quaint town of   that is situated in  . “Having been there earlier with friends, I fell in love with the place. It is so old-world and charms you with its coconut groves and backwaters. So this time around when my family decided to go on a holiday, I told them that we should go to Bekal,” shares Pranitha. The destination was a luxury resort that is situated by the backwaters. “It was all about R&R (rest and relaxation). So while my parents chilled out in the garden and read extensively on the hammocks, my cousins and I went kayaking every evening to watch the sun set on the Arabian coast,” says the actor. The spa was another favourite spot and Pranitha indulged in Ayurvedic massages and herbal detoxes. “The Sattvic food saw me going back for repeat helpings. I especially pigged out on the coconut pudding and had six helpings of it,” smiles Pranitha. They also went on a temple trail and visited the famous Madhur temple which is in the vicinity. “I’ve already planned my next visit here,” wraps Pranitha.
