BAREILLY: Dike Victoria, a native of Nigeria, is perhaps the only   in  .

 And it does seem strange at times to be the odd one out in the entire city. A BPharma student at the  , she says her initial trepidation has given way to joy in the two years that she’s been in this part of Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “I never faced any racial discrimination in the city,” Dike, the 19-year-old who won the university’s Miss Invertia 2017 title, says. Though three attacks on Africans have been reported recently in the state and they have “disturbed” her, Dike says her time in India has been relatively “problem free”.
 
 Of course, when she came to Bareilly from Nigeria’s Abuja city, it seemed to her like she had come to a different world. “The initial months were tough, mostly because of the language barrier,” she says. "No one from my family, or my friends, had ever been to India before. Few in Bareilly would speak English and their pronunciation was different from mine.
 
 Others would prefer to talk in Hindi. I was clueless for three to four months because I could not understand a word of what others were saying.”
 
 Dike has now learnt Hindi with the help of her Indian friends. She even sings a few Bollywood songs. “But I share the larger African community’s anxiety following the attacks,” she says.
 
 “My university is secure. Had there been bias, I would not have won the Miss Invertia 2017. I am proud to say I am the first foreigner to win this crown.”
