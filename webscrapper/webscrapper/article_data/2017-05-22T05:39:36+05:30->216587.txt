LUCKNOW: You may see city   without any   and even   manning shops in fixed spots by next year. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation has initiated the process to form a new town vending committee after the state government released the ‘Uttar Pradesh Street Vending Policy’ on May 10.

 The committee would be formed by July 2017 and would have at least 40% licensed street vendors as its members. The panel would identify vending and non-vending zones in Lucknow and assign fixed spots the licensed vendors. Earlier in 2014,   had constituted a temporary town vending committee to work on Union government’s Street Vendors Act.
 
 In 2014, the temporary committee did identify a few areas like Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Kanpur Road, Ashok Marg and Park Road as non-vending zones, however in the absence of stringent rules the legislation pertaining to non-vending zones could not be implemented till date. As a result, small vendors, stalls and shops have mushroomed on most roads, leading to frequent traffic problems.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner PK Srivastava said, “As per government’s notification, this time the town vending committee will only consider those vendors as members who are nominated by the vendors’ association. They will have 40% reservation in the committee, the remaining members will comprise officials from LMC, police and other government departments.” Those vendors who are interested in applying for the committee’s membership should send applications to their association.
 
 As per LMC estimates, there are over 25,000 vendors in the city, of which only a small number has applied for a license. The committee will ensure that there are vending and non-vending areas in each zone and licensed street vendors are given fixed spots of 1-2 sq mt each to run their business. Officials said they have to implement vending rules in next six months.
