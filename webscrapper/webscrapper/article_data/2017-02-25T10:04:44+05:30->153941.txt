MUMBAI: The contentious issue of management of the   between the   (WITA) and   (RWITC), which has been lingering on for almost two years, has finally taken its toll on races to be held on Wednesday, March 1. 

 RWITC has cancelled races after trainers did not send in entries for the same. Now, evening races to be held on Sunday, which includes the prestigious Poonawalla Breeders' MultiMillion, also may not happen as the trainers have decided not to saddle their horses unless the issue is resolved.
 
 RWITC had formed a Working Group (WG) comprising of  , Ram Shroff and Milan Luthria to look into the matter and submit their recommendation to the managing committee (MC). The WG did meet WITA representatives last month, but the two members of WG, Shroff and Luthria did not turn up. Dhunjibhoy, however, discussed the issue with trainers and both parties agreed on certain proposals (see box).
 
 The MC, however, rejected the proposal claiming that they arrived at a decision in the absence of two other members of WG. It had upset the trainers. 
 
 "It is not our fault if the two members did not attend the meeting. RWITC is just trying to keep the issue on hold which they have been doing for almost two years now," said Iver Fernandes on behalf of WITA.
 
 RWITC says WITA 's action is unreasonable. "We say that an opportunity must be given to the WG to meet with all members present, as it was not a unanimous view of the WG. I assure them that the WG will meet as soon as possible. At worst, the MC will deliberate on it at its next meeting on March 9," RWITC chairman Vivek Jain told TOI. 
 
 It is indeed surprising that in this day and age when various forms of electronic communication channels are available, why the club cannot hold an emergency meeting to sort out the issue.
