CHENNAI:   chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday announced an interim relief of Rs 15 crore for fishermen affected by oil spill following the collision of two ships – the MT Dawn Kanchipuram and the MT Maple -- off   port in January.

 The chief minister announced the relief after holding a high-level meeting at the secretariat on Thursday. 
 
 “The CM announces Rs 5,000 each to 30,000 fishing families affected by oil spill in three districts (Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur). Further, two fish markets will be set up at Ernavur and Nochikuppam at Rs 75 lakh,” said an official statement.
 
 In line with the state’s announcement earlier, efforts were on to get compensation from the shipping companies through the Centre. Applications from the insurance companies were being distributed to the fishing families, and filled-in forms were being received. Given that it is a world-wide phenomenon during such accidents, getting compensation from insurance companies is a delayed process.
 
 The oil spill from the ships spread along Chennai coastline and to the neighbouring districts. A massive clean-up exercise was launched by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Greater Chennai Corporation, revenue department, fire and rescue services, highways, fisheries and coastal protection group and several central government agencies, besides the Indian  , involving some 5,700 people on a war-footing manner.
 
 With the army of volunteers chipping in, huge tonnage of oil sludge was removed from the coast for 25 days. “Livelihood of fishermen of three districts was affected as they could not venture into the sea since the day of oil spill, and due to reluctance to purchase fishes from them,” the statement said. 
 
 The state-run Fisheries University has taken up studies off the coast and certified the fishes eatable.
