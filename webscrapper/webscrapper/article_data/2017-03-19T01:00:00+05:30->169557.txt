Singer, actor, VJ and dancer   broke many hearts last year when the news of her engagement started doing the rounds. But it was soon revealed that her ‘engagement’ was only a clever marketing strategy for her single, ' ', which crossed nine million hits. 

 Now, she is working on her next single, which will have a surprise element. Says Sophie, “I have been busy recording my new singles, some of which will be collaborations with exciting names. With my next single, people will be truly surprised.” 
 
 She is also busy with live shows, concerts and corporate gigs across the world. She says, “I love being known as one of the popular performers in the live show circuit. I’m known for my pop diva avatar, that’s something I won’t give up, but it felt cool to sing some French lines for ' '. I’ve already recorded some more playback songs.” 
 
 She adds, “Earlier, I would be asked to pick between singing, acting and anchoring. Do only one, they would tell me. But today, when artistes do more than one thing, everyone is in awe of them. Now, it’s cool to be multitalented. I guess I was ahead of my time in terms of style, videos and attitude. That’s why I have carved a niche on my own terms.”
