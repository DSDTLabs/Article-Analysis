Chandigarh: For stopping another 200 teachers whom the education department has called on deputation from Punjab and Haryana, the UT-cadre educational employees union had a meeting on Sunday.

 The UT-cadre educational employees demand repatriation of deputed teachers who have overstayed since 2011. “The union has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi but the administration has also defied the instructions of local MP Kirron Kher to check the overstaying of deputed teachers,” a member of the union said.
 
 “More than 450 teachers deputed to Chandigarh have overstayed. They have worked here for more than 15 years but the education department is not ready to repatriate them. Even the teachers from Panchkula and Mohali are in Chandigarh on deputation. Instead of sending them back to their states, the department is calling more of them over on deputation,” union president Swaran Singh Kamboj said.
 
 He alleged that some officials of the department got personal and monetary favours to promote extreme deputation in Chandigarh. “The recruitment of teachers in 2015 is under police scrutiny,” a member of the protesting union said. “The previous promotions in 2013 and 2014 also seem to be on the basis of financial favours. Even the ministers of Punjab and Haryana are quiet, as they don’t need these teachers back.”
 
 “If these teachers are unwanted in own states, why did the states hire them?” Kamboj said. “The teachers are shirking their responsibility to the children of their states. Their governments need to take a positive step by calling back those who have overstayed.” The UT-cadre educational employees union wants the overstaying teachers repatriated fast.
