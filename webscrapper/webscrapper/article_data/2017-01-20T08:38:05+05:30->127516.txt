PUNE: The habit of keeping cartridges of 9mm pistol in her purse after   in the US landed a 25-year-old American national woman of Indian origin in the soup at the   on Tuesday night.

 The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel found two bullets in her purse during the security check. She was later handed over to police, but was not arrested.
 
 Before coming to India to attend a marriage about 10 days ago, she forgot to take the bullets out of her purse. Yet, she cleared the   at the airport in America and in Delhi while coming. The two bullets were traced when she was going to Delhi from Pune on Tuesday night. 
 
 Senior inspector of the Airport police Sanjay Naik-Patil said the woman had been booked under the relevant sections of the Indain Arms Act. Praising the alert CISF personnel at the Lohegaon airport, a senior police officer of the crime branch said it was shocking how the security personnel at the airport in America and Delhi failed to trace the bullets in the woman’s purse.
 
 Senior inspector Naik-Patil said the woman was a chartered accountant in the US. She had come to Pune for a marriage function about 10 days ago. “She claimed that she had forgotten to remove the bullets from her purse before coming to India,” he said.
 
 Naik-Patil said the woman regularly practised shooting in the US with her 9mm pistol. “On Tuesday night, she was to fly to Delhi from the Lohegaon airport. The CISF personnel at the airport found two bullets in her purse. They did not allow her to board the flight and sent her to the police station,” Naik Patil said, adding that the probe was on.
