NAGPUR: Over 30,000 consumers in northern part of the city had to go without power for four to five hours when two transformers at 132/11 KV   substation developed minor snags.

 Consumers of Koradi were also hit by the snag. The affected areas in the city were Mankapur, part of  , NADT, Gorewada pumping station, etc.
 
 A source in SNDL said that one 25 MVA transformer at Mahatransco’s Mankapur substation conked off at around 3.30pm. “We received complaints from Gorewada area that there was no power supply. When our repair team tried to find the reason they found out that it was a major breakdown. We immediately went for backfeeding and restored power to some localities. It was not possible to backfeed the entire affected area because of heavy load. Everybody uses air coolers and air-conditioners during the afternoon and power consumption is very high,” he added.
 
 According to the source, just as SNDL had managed to restore supply to most affected areas, another 25 MVA transformer at Mankapur went phut. “This hit us badly because power demand during evening is the highest. People use air coolers as well as electric lights,” he said.
 
 Mahatransco chief engineer Vikas Bade described the breakdowns as minor. “There was a cable fault in the first transformer, which we repaired by evening. Then another transformer developed a minor problem on 11 KV side. It will be repaired soon,” he told TOI on Monday evening.
