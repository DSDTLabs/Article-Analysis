NEW DELHI: A gang of auto-lifters, which was busted in northwest Delhi on Friday, used to steal two-wheelers and lease them out to snatchers for a daily rent of Rs 1,000. After renting out a stolen vehicle for few days, the gang would sell it off to a mechanic. 

 The police said that after stealing a two-wheeler, the original numberplate would be replaced to avoid getting traced. The stolen vehicles usually came retrofitted as per the specifications of the snatchers. If anybody preferred a car, the gang would supply it for a daily rent of Rs 5,000. 
 
 The accused, Rajinder Kumar, Akash and Monu, were caught from a workshop near Mangolpuri. The northwest district police started looking for them after a series of vehicle theft cases were reported from   and Adarsh Nagar. A team laid a trap near Pitampura and arrested the men, said DCP (northwest) Milind Dumbere. 
 
 Ten motorcycles and two scooters were recovered from the trio, but the police said that the gang might be involved in stealing more than 100 vehicles.
 
 Kumar turned out to be a motorcycle mechanic based in outer Delhiâ€™s Kirari. He had 19 previous cases of vehicle thefts against him in several police stations. Kumar was in contact with several phone and chain snatchers in outer Delhi who operated in areas like Mangolpuri and Sultanpuri and they were his regular customers, the police said.
 
 Snatchers preferred hiring the vehicles as this would help them avoid getting traced, said sources.
