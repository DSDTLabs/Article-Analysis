NEW DELHI: Delhi   on Monday moved the high court challenging continuance of disqualified MLA   as the transport minister.

 In the petition, the MLAs have also questioned the reasoning of the   speaker allowing   to continue to attend the house on the ground that he has six months since the disqualification to get reelected.
 
 The plea, filed through advocate Balendu Sekhar, seeks the court’s intervention, arguing that the speaker’s decision to permit Gahlot to sit in the House is contrary to the Constitution and the 1991 NCT of Delhi Act.
 
 BJP MLAs Vijender Gupta, O P Sharma and Jagdish Pradhan have submitted that once an MLA has been disqualified by the  , he/she cannot continue under any circumstances.
 
 It is likely to come up for hearing sometime this week. The MLAs had last week protested against Gahlot’s presence in the House on the first day of the budget session. They had argued that Gahlot can’t appear in the House as he has been disqualified as a legislator by the EC in the   case. But Gahlot has the backing of the speaker Ram Niwas Goel who said justified the minister’s presence and said he can attend the proceedings for six months from the date of disqualification.
