COIMBATORE: In two separate incidents, as many elephants were found dead in   district on Saturday. While a female elephant aged about 25 years died of starvation at Anthiyur forest range, a male elephant aged about 10-12 years was electrocuted at   forest range. In the second case, police have arrested a farmer for erecting an illegal electric fencing.

 On Saturday early morning, Anthiyur forest ranger SP Ramaraj and a team comprising anti-poaching watchers came across the carcass of an elephant at Chellampalayam west beat area while on patrol duty. They immediately brought the Brahmmadesam veterinary dispensary doctor,  , to perform postmorem.
 
 The preliminary autopsy report suggested that the elephant died of starvation. “The elephant hadn’t eaten anything for many days. As such, the animal was very weak that it could not walk long distance in search of food. The animal had died at least two days ago. All the organs seemed to be normal. I will send the samples of vital organs to the veterinary lab for further test,” Dr Arjunan said.
 
 After the postmortem, the carcass was left at the spot for natural decay.
 
 In the second incident, a young male elephant was killed when it came into contact with an electric fencing at a farmland near   in the Sathyamangalam forest range. According to officials, Krishnasamy set up the fencing around the two acres land he had taken on lease to protect maize and cabbage cultivated there from wild elephant raid.
 
 “He connected live wire to the fencing. On Saturday, the elephant tried to enter the agriculture field and it was electrocuted,” an official said.
 
 When alerted, Sathyamangalam forest ranger   and team rushed to the spot and arrested Krishnamurthy. After the postmortem, the carcass of the animal was buried. The forest department has recommended the Tangedco to disconnect the power connection to the agricultural land.
