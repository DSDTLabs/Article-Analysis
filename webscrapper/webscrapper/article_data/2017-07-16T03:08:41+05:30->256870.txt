NOIDA: Over 500   of various Amrapali   staged a   at the builder’s office in   on Saturday. They said they were distraught over the long waiting period and the lack of results at the ground level, despite Amrapali’s commitments.

 Amrapali group is one of the biggest debtors to   and the GNIDA, and had recently proposed that it could bail out of the situation with the help of co-developers. 
 
 While the builder claims to have got eight co-developers, Noida Authority officials have so far not confirmed whether the proposal to help Amrapali diversify its risks has been accepted.
 
 On Saturday, buyers from eight projects protested over the delay in providing possession of their homes, ranging from three to five years. 
 
 “Our patience has run out. Amrapali has so many projects, but no impact is being noticed on the ground. What are we supposed to do in such a situation?” asked Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association (Nefowa).
 
 Meanwhile, Shiv Priya, executive director, Amrapali group, said, “It is a matter of time before the proposal for accepting co-developers is approved. This is the only way out. The buyers should understand that we have submitted a schedule of completion and won’t be able to build 40,000 flats overnight.”
 
 “We are persistently working towards completion. We have even opened escrow accounts with buyers in two of our projects. Out of 40,000 buyers, just a few hundred protesting doesn’t represent the grouse of all our customers,” Priya added.
