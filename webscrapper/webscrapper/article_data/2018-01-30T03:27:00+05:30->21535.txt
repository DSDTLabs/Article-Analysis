Panaji: The Goa   has asked the state government for permission to recruit 1,228 more personnel to staff its force. It says that the rising influx of tourists has made the maintenance of law and   challenging. These additional cops, if approved, will range from superintendents of police (SPs) to  . The force has also requested 120 ministerial posts.

 The proposed recruitment would include five SPs, 13 deputy SPs, 60 police inspectors (PIs), 300 police sub-inspectors (PSIs), 250 assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), and 300 head constables and constables. 
 
 Goa police currently has 6,051 personnel. They maintain law and order along with the India reserve battalion, which is 2,068-strong. A senior cop said that currently there are around 300 vacancies across levels in the Goa Police. “This is highly inadequate when it comes to important events in Goa,” a senior police official said. “Thus, we are compelled to requisition staff from neighbouring states and also from central forces.” 
 
 The Goa police proposal states that the influx of migrants, tourists, and the state’s rapid industrialization has resulted in an increase in organized crime, economic crimes, and cyber crimes. Also, the increasing number of vehicles has put a lot of pressure on the traffic units of Goa Police. 
 
 The proposal also states that while over the past few years, a number of posts of constables have been created, there has been no proportionate increase in posts of head-constables, ASIs, PSIs, PIs, DySPs, and SPs. 
 
 Thus, police say that it now takes almost 20 to 25 years for constables to become head constables, and many personnel who join as constables retire as head constables, with just one promotion in their career as opposed to the two they are entitled to.
 
 This is an injustice to lower subordinates, police sources say, and in view of the laws to be enforced, there is a need for more officers. Hence, the need to create these additional posts.
