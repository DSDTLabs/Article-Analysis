CHENNAI:   deputy general secretary and   candidate   on Wednesday said he would win the byelection and help carry on the "good governance" of former chief minister  . 

 After being formally introduced as the party candidate by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Wednesday evening, Dinakaran urged the huge throng of party functionaries to strive hard to help him triumph in the election.
 
 Dinakaran said he would begin his campaign on Thursday evening. "Tomorrow at 11am when I come here to file my nomination I will do so after the two leaves symbol has been established as rightfully belonging to AIADMK. I will be the candidate contesting under the two leaves symbol," he declared, as loud cheers rent the air. 
 
 His hopes were, however, dashed as the   late on Wednesday froze the two leaves symbol. Earlier, representatives of the two 'factions' in the AIADMK led by V K Sasikala and former chief minister O Panneerselvam presented their arguments before Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi in New Delhi. 
 
 Equating the current situation to the time in 1989 when the two leaves symbol was first frozen following a split in the AIADMK, Dinakaran said he was only 24 then. "I was with Amma and I used to accompany the team to New Delhi to fight for the symbol." He recalled that former attorney general K Parasaran had represented the Jayalalithaa faction and helped it win the symbol. The party was now being represented by his son and former solicitor general Mohan Parasaran, said Dinakaran.
 
 "I never dreamed I would be entering the assembly. But, with your efforts and hard work, I am confident I will win with a huge margin," Dinakaran told his party colleagues, urging them to go to the people across the constituency and get him votes. "My sole objective in contesting this election is to fulfill Amma's dreams and continue her work," he said.
