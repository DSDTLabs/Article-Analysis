CHENNAI: The   on Monday rejected a public interest writ petition which sought a direction to the   government to declare public holiday for   festival. 

 Falling on February 10 this year, Thai Poosam marks the full moon day in the Tamil month of Thai. More than 60 lakh people throng the six holy abodes of Lord Muruga on this day, said of A Annadurai of Tiruppur district. 
 
 Noting that Thai Poosam is a national holiday in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Singapore, his counsel Purushothaman said Tamil Nadu should declare the day a public holiday. 
 
 However, the court sought to know whether he was aware of the number of public holidays in countries like Singapore and Malaysia. 
 
 The   said Thai Poosam was akin to Ganesh Chathurthi, Krishna Jayanthi and Saraswsthi Puja for which holidays had already been declared. 
 
 Reiterating its stand that it was for the government to take a decision on such issues, the bench said the court would not interfere. It also refused to direct the government to consider the pleas in this regard.
