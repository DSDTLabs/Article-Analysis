BELAGAVI: After a gap of almost two years, Belagavi   Ltd. will finally begin work by building a demo   from Mandoli Road to KPTCL Road. However as the firm has decided to widen the demo road to 80 feet and increase its length by 950m, several families will lose their houses.

 If the project is implemented, as many as three families will become homeless. Another nine houses will face partial demolition, two of which to the extent of 50%. It was found that these houses will be affected during the marking for the road.
 
 According to sources, a few houses here were built more than five decades ago. In Chougulewadi, many houses will lose about 5-7 feet and in Dwarkanagar a few houses will lose compound walls. However, in Ayodhya Nagar five families will become homeless after the road widening.
 
 Work towards building the smart road gained momentum after   the Chairman of the Smart City project held a meeting recently with Belagavi Smart City Project MD   and Mayor   recently and instructed to start the work immediately.
 
 Local resident Anil S said, “The road should be 80 feet wide consistently. But due to wrong planning of the smart city project, helpless people in Ayodhya Nagar will lose their shelter. The officials are guarding the houses of the rich while daring to demolish houses of the poor.”
 
 Anant Deshpande, councillor of ward number 18 said the Smart City project was a central government program and it has to be implemented. “It is also important that the families which will lose their houses should get justifying compensation. Families who had lost their homes during implementation of the Master Plan on Congress Road in 1994 were rehabilitated. Now, those on Mandoli Road should also be rehabilitated on the same lines. The MD of the Smart City Project has responded positively to this demand,” he said.
