LUCKNOW: Edged out of the  ,   chief   on Friday hinted that his party may look for a post poll tie-up with parties in case of a hung assembly.

 “No party appears to be getting a clear majority under the present political circumstances,“ said Singh, adding that RLD would assess the situation post elections and consider the possibility of entering into an alliance with the party that gets maximum MLAs. He, however, clarified that RLD would not ally with BJP at any cost. “At present, we are making our presence felt across the state by fielding more than 150 candidates," he said. Singh added that his son   will not contest the assembly elections but will be party's CM face.
 
 Ajit Singh, who was keen on alliance with SP and Congress, had reportedly demanded over 30 seats. SP leadership distanced itself from him while asking   to negotiate with RLD. Even as SP and Congress sealed their alliance, Ajit found himself edged out. He, however, claimed that his party was never a partner in any alliance. “We did not speak either to Congress or SP about any alliance," Singh claimed.
