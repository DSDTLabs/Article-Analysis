Lucknow: The irrigation department is ready to open the   route after a long wait of six months, provided there is no rain and the weather remains dry. The road was blocked on December 10, 2016, on both ends to facilitate construction of trunk (intercepting) drains along Gomti below the barrage. 

 With the department completing tunnel work on both sides and laying trunk drain on one side, it is ready to restore the Barrage Road. As part of the riverfront project, two parallel trunk drains were to be made along the riversides to prevent sewage flow into the river. This construction led to deep cracks on the Barrage Road and also caused caving in of the approach road near Samta Mulak Crossing and irrigation department’s office on Dalibagh side. 
 
 As a result, the road was closed to prevent mishaps. Despite several deadlines, the department was unable to open the barrage for several reasons — incomplete construction, lack of funds, transfer of officials and weather conditions. 
 
 The department has sought Rs 1 crore from the government to complete restoration. A senior official said, “Our principal secretary has agreed to provide funds for such projects so we have sent the request and hope to receive money soon.” 
 
 The department has also asked PWD authorities to deploy an assistant engineer on the site while restoration is conducted so that he can supervise construction and ensure that all PWD standards are met. An official said, “Since the construction is complete, we can open the route in 6-7 days, if the weather remains dry.”
