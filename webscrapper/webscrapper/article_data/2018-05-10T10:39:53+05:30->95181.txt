 A bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice   was hearing a public interest petition filed by Balasivudu of Hyderabad, who charged the authorities with ignoring norms while filling the posts. 
 
 Assistant Solicitor General   argued on behalf of the central government and told the court that this petition was not maintainable because it looked more like a service related dispute. The bench refused to accept this line of argument and said when authorities resort to whimsical ways for taking in their own men into the varsity without following any procedure, there is nothing wrong in questioning the same by way of a public interest litigation. The bench sought counters from the authorities and selected employees and posted the case to four weeks.
