NEW DELHI: The   of   was in full bloom at   as the second annual   got off to a flying start on Friday. 

 Swaying to Odia tunes were  ,   and Paika dancers in their elaborate attires and weapons. A large 3D structure depicting a scene from the Paika rebellion of 1817 generated a lot of interest. But most were drawn to the over 80 food stalls selling authentic yet cheap Odia food like rasagola, pittha-mitha, saccharine khaja, and non-vegetarian items like prawns and mutton. 
 
 According to the event organisers, the number of food stalls has gone up this year as the public response was quite encouraging the previous year. The vendors also expected to do brisk business. 
 
 “Much like last year, when all our items were sold out in a couple of hours, we hope to do good business this year,” said Nihar Ranjan from Cuttack. 
 
 Delhi resident Aqueel-ur-Rehman relished the Odia dahi bada and was all praise for the food and handicrafts on display at the three-day event. 
 
 The stalls selling Sambalpuri, Behrampur and Kotpad sarees drew huge footfall. People were also interested in the Chandua applique work, sea shell or shankha jewellery, patachitra artwork, filigree jewellery and showpieces made from rice paddy. 
 
 CJI Dipak Misra inaugurated the event and said he was born in Banipur, a town known for Paika fighters. 
 
 “We have completed 200 years of Paika Rebellion and we must celebrate it,” Misra said.
 
 Union minsiter Dharmendra Pradhan said the festival would create a buzz for the artistes and vendors brought from all over Odisha. 
 
 IT professional Tukunu Sahu is from Odisha but has been in Delhi for 12 years. He came with his wife and daughter. “Such festivals bring home closer to us,” he said.
