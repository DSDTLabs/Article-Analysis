It has been quite sometime since Deeepika Padukone and   were spotted together. Well, it could be because of their tight schedule in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmavati’. 

 DeepVeer are one of the most loved couple of  . Whether it is on screen or off screen, they always leave us in awe with their romance and amazing screen presence that make us want more of them.
 
 Well, guess what! Looks like they might just team up for Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s next venture. A few days back,   was spotted visiting the ‘Munnabhai MBBS’ director and now even Ranveer was clicked outside the filmmaker’s house. 
 
 The reason for these speculations is that both Deepika and Ranveer just have one movie each post ‘Padmavati’. While DP has signed up for a biopic on Sapna Didi opposite Irrfan Khan, Ranveer Singh has ‘Gully Boy’ opposite Alia Bhatt.
 
 It will be quite a visual treat for all DeepVeer fans to see them come on the big screen together for the fourth time, and if reports happen to be true, then we hope that   gives them a romcom script as that is something they haven’t done together.
