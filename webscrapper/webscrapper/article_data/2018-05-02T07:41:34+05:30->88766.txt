 Talking about his priorities, he said that his first task is to increase the happiness index of the people. In an election year, this is of utmost importance to the government which is going to the people for a fresh mandate in next few months.
 
 Gupta said that he had directed the officials to meet the target of the schemes in the stipulated period. “The people had to get the benefits of the government schemes with minimum waiting period,” he said.
 
 So, meeting the targets of flagship schemes, especially directly related to the common people, is of utmost importance. The major change in the bureaucracy is being seen in this context.
 
 Another important aspect is bringing in harmony between the peoples’ representatives and bureaucracy. Very often there were complaints of ministers and MLAs that they have been sidelined by the bureaucrats or being ignored in decision making.
 
 Gupta said that the bureaucrats cannot ignore the wishes of the peoples’ representatives and they should be taken in to confidence. There should be harmony between these two organs of the government. 
 
 He said, the major challenge in to realize the announcements of the budget on the ground. As finance secretary he has been working hard to give financial approval to the schemes announced in the budget. Considering the time constraints, the government is on the fast-forward mode and there is no place for complacency.
