Vijayawada: The rift in TDP ranks in the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) Council has further wideed with the rebel corporators demanding rotation system for the city   position.

 Though the trouble-shooter sent by the party,  , claimed that the issue had been resolved, he said he would take the demand to the notice of the high command.
 
 Differences among the TDP corporators have been exposed with 15 of them lodging a written complaint to city president Buddha Venkanna alleging that mayor Koneru Sridhar is behaving with them in an insulting manner.
 
  They expressed displeasure over the comments made by Sridhar and demanded action against him. 
 
 The TDP high command took the matter seriously and party president N Chandrababu Naidu himself asked Venkanna to intervene and defuse the situation.
 
 Venkanna held talks with the corporators and noted down their grievances. 
 
 The rebel corporators told him that the mayor is treating them like members of the Opposition party. They even complained that Sridhar’s behaviour with the corporation officials is objectionable. 
 
 To set the things right, they have proposed to change the mayor and give other communities also a chance.
 
 After meeting the corporators, Venkanna met mayor Sridhar to hear his version.
 
 Sources close to him told that he held his ground and told Venkanna that he did not do anything wrong. The allegations were made due to some other reasons and they have nothing to do with his behaviour. However, he was asked to coordinate with all corporators and raise any issue related to the party at appropriate forums instead of in the public.
