You can take a Bong out of Bengal, but can you ever do it the other way round?   -the quietest, softest, most low-profile among Bollywood's Bangali quartet of Shoojit, Sujoy, Dibakar and him â€” wears his Bangaliana on his sleeve, in film after film. So whether it's the way he shows Darjeeling in  !, or the weird Bengali coinages in Jagga Jasoos, you know that you can't take Bengal out of this Bong from Bhilai. In Kolkata, he is the neighbour of Cactus frontman Sidhu and their houses in Garia have a common corner. Anurag's maternal grandmother is famous in the para as Majumdar Mashima and the director, in his early years, would holiday there and play galli cricket. Pinku, as he is known in the neighbourhood, would even call out for Banta aka Sidhu while entering his grandmom's house. Anurag still spends time with his grandma when in town, though the visits have become fewer.No wonder the world of fantasy in   is built with bricks of Bangaliana. In one scene, I saw  , our teenage detective, looking intently at his laptop and typing out one word, which, for me, summed up the spirit of the film. As   kept searching for Hotel `Agapastala', the Bengali in me did somersaults in joy. From Tiktiki railway station to Shundi (fictional kingdom in Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne) -there's a lot in the film for Bengalis to identify with. Anurag once told me his closest buddy in Kolkata was Roopa Ganguly. The other Bengali he gels with is composer Pritam -theirs is a friendship worth exploring another day .
