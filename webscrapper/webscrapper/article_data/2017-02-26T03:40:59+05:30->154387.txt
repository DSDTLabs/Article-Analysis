Ahmedabad: The   (ACPC) has announced that awareness programmes for engineering and pharmacy admissions will be organized for class 12 science stream students. 

 The programmes which will be held across 105 locations will begin from April 3. Details about online admission process, fee structure and the process of filling admission forms, selecting colleges, availing benefits of government schemes and scholarships and the process of availing education loans will be explained to the students and their parents during these programmes.
 
  principal G P Vadodariya, who is also member secretary of the ACPC, said, “The students will be made aware of online admission process during the programme. Apart from the planned 105 locations for these programmes, we will also send our representatives to other locations on request to hold awareness programmes.”
 
 “The students will be guided on selecting respective disciplines for admissions and total number of seats in the state that are available. Moreover, they will be made aware of the large number of seats remaining vacant so that they don’t opt for management quota admissions and later struggle for refund of fees,” he added.
 
 The ACPC will also issue an information booklet of 16 pages for class 12 students through which they can understand the process of admissions. Interestingly, the booklet also contains screen shots of web pages of the online admission portal of the ACPC so that the students can have a fair idea about the process.
 
 There are no major changes in the rules for admissions this time around except for GUJCET replacing JEE exams for preparation of merit list. The list will be prepared based on the score of GUJCET (40% weightage) and Board Exam Results (60% weightage).
 
  The entire process will be completed by the ACPC representatives by the end of April.
