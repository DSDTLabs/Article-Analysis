GUWAHATI:   Nahid Afrin, who faces a fatwa from 46 clerics in the state, on Wednesday said she would not be cowed into silence.

 "I am not afraid. But I was saddened when I came to know that I will not be allowed to sing at the upcoming event," Nahid said from her home in  , about 180 km from here. "I take this as another struggle in my life," she added.
 
 Nahid was scheduled to sing at an event at the   grounds at Lanka in Assam's Hojai district on March 25.
 
 While many described the pamphlets issued against the event as a fatwa, some   said it was a public appeal as the venue is surrounded by masjids, madrassas, idgahs and graveyards.
 
 "I do not bear a grudge against those who do not want me to sing. Music is a part of my life and I cannot do without it," said Nahid. The objection to her event came at a time the youngster had just got admission to Class X. "The fatwa has not only disturbed her, it has distracted her. Fortunately, she got an overwhelming support from the people and different organizations. This has given her the strength to face the crisis," said her mother, Fatima, adding, "I am proud of my daughter."
 
 Nahid started singing from the age of three. "By the time she was in Class IV, she had started doing stage shows," said Fatima.
 
 Nahid trained under  . "When we found she had a strong interest in singing, we encouraged her to pursue music," said her mother.
 
 Nahid shot into the limelight two years ago when as a participant at Indian Idol Junior she caught everyone's attention. Though she finished as the first runner-up, her voice captivated many hearts. Ever since, there has been no looking back.
 
 Nahid made her Bollywood debut with 'Akira' in 2015. She has also sung for Assamese films, some with singing heartthrob Zubin Garg.
