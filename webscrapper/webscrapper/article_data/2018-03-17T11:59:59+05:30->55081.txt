BHOPAL: A magisterial inquiry has been ordered after the death of a man in police custody in   district on Thursday. Three cops were suspended while the SHO of the police station was taken off field duty and transferred to the police lines as punishment.

 It is suspected that  , a local shopkeeper, who had been to   police station with a complaint of theft, died after being beaten by police inside the thana. A post-mortem report also revealed “injury marks” on the body and head of the deceased. Sources said that the CCTV network of the thana was not functioning for the past few weeks.
 
 Soni, in his complaint, had told police that his cell phone and some cash were stolen. Superintendent of police Satyandra Shukla said Manoj was under the influence of liquor when he had gone to lodge the report.
 
 “This is not for the first time that he had been to the police station when he was drunk. Earlier also in an inebriated state, he had been to the thana and would even sleep inside it,” he said.
 
 Manoj’s wife Neelu Soni alleged, “My husband was beaten in front of me. When I requested the police to let my husband go, they denied and asked me to come in the morning.”
 
 She alleged that when she reached the police station, her husband had already died. Rahatgarh police however, maintained that Manoj was alive till Thursday morning but later his health condition deteriorated and he died.
 
 Local BJP MLA   demanded that inspector general of police   remove all the thana staff to have an impartial inquiry. “The hapless wife of deceased and her children had seen the police thrashing the man, they are not lying,” she said.
 
 Later, a magisterial inquiry was ordered and a post-mortem was conducted in the presence of an executive magistrate.
