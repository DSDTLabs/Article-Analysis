 Coimbatore: A 36-year-old woman, who had reportedly given Rs1.32crore to her friend for investing in the share market, committed suicide by hanging at her residence at Perur Chettipalayam on Saturday evening. Her friend had just told her that the business was a flop and wanted more money from her to recover the losses. The rural police have booked five people in this case for abetment of suicide. Police have formed a team to arrest the five absconding accused.
 
 The deceased was identified as K Vishalakhsi, 36, from Perur Chettipalayam. She was a home maker. Her husband P Kumaresan, 40, was working as an assistant in a private bank. Vishalakshi was a good friend of Jothilakshmi from Selvapuram, who was involved in the share market business. The latter encouraged her to invest in the business. Consequently, Vishalakshi borrowed lakhs of rupees from friends and neighbours and invested Rs1.32crores in Jothilakshmi’s business.
 
 Last week, Vishalakshi was informed by Jothilakshmi that the share market business was a failure and she could not even return her investment. Jothilakshmi’s husband Sivakumar, her elder brother Manikandan, a chit fund firm manager Sivaprakash and assistant manager Nithya demanded Rs35lakh from Vishalakshi to recover the losses.
 
 Unable to bear the pressure, Vishalakshi hanged herself using a sari. Police found a suicide not in her residence. In the note, she stated that the five people had swindled Rs1.32crore from her.
 
 Perur police was informed and they sent the body to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem on Saturday evening. It was handed over to kin of the deceased on Sunday.
 
 Perur police registered a case against the five people under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code and further investigation is on.
