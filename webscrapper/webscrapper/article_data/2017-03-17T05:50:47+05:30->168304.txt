BENGALURU: After placing a cap on  , the government may allow farmers to   at multiplexes. Replying to BJP's M K Pranesh in the legislative council on Thursday, municipal administration minister   said the objective is to help coconut growers reeling under drought. However, he did not commit on BJP members' demand to restrict the sale of soft drinks in multiplexes. The   government recently banned sale of aerated beverages in multiplexes on health grounds and said only tender coconut water would be available for movie goers. 

  Home minister   said the CM would take a call on selling of tender coconuts in 1,500 multi plexes in the state.
