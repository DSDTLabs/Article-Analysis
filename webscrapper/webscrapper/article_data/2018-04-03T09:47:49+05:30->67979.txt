GUWAHATI: The Union home ministry partially withdrew the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 from   Pradesh in two police station areas, Likabali police station in West Siang district and   in East Siang district, bordering Assam. 

 The Act has, however, been extended by six more months in three eastern districts of the state which border Myanmar - Tirap, Longding and Changlang - and specific areas under eight police stations of seven other districts bordering Assam. The three districts have been under Afspa since January 2016. 
 
 The eight police stations where the Act will continue to be in effect are Balemu and Bhalukpong police stations in West Kameng district, Seijosa police station in East Kameng district, Balijan police station in Papumpare district, Namsai and Mahadevpur police stations in Namsai district, Roing police station in   district and Sunpura police station in Lohit district.
 
 The home ministry notification states that a review of the law and order situation was undertaken in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts and the area falling under the jurisdiction of 11 police stations bordering Assam. Apart from the two police station areas where the review suggested an "improved situation", the rest of the areas were declared as "disturbed areas" under Section 3 of Afspa up to September 30, 2018, unless withdrawn earlier, the notification adds.
 
 These areas have been declared as disturbed area due to various violent activities by NSCN (K), Ulfa (I) and NDFB (S).
 
 Apart from Arunachal, the Centre has enforced the Act in all of Nagaland state and a 10-km strip inside   bordering Assam, while the state governments of Assam and Manipur now have the powers to retaim or revoke the Act. Tripura revoked it a few years ago.
