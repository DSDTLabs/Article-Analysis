Even as the Delhi University’s admission process was made completely online, a large number of parents and aspirants attended the ‘Open Day’ held at the conference hall.

 The second day of the counselling session, on Tuesday, saw more participation. Most parents arrived at the venue with a multitude of questions. And many of them vowed to return the next day, with more queries. Meanwhile, a first-year DU student, Viktor Avinash Sinha, went out of his way to assist the aspirants in understanding the admission process and help them with course selection.
 
 Sinha, a English (Honors) student at Delhi College of Arts and Commerce, said his exams finished on Monday, “So I decided to come here help out the aspirants”. The 19-year-old, who is from Siliguri, said that he too, was troubled by the whole admission procedure when he came last year. However, a university official opposed Sinha’s activity saying, “There is no clarity in the data he is providing. We have our own approved volunteers who go out and help students. For this we have already requested colleges,” said Gurpreet Tuteja, deputy dean of student’s welfare, DU. tnn
