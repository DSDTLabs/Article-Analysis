KOLKATA: An   in his early 50s, who allegedly faked himself as a “child specialist and general surgeon” and practised at his chamber-cumresidence in   for the last six years, was arrested on Sunday evening.Asim Kumar Banerjee was picked up from his private chamber at F1, Bapuji Nagar after members of a human rights organisation posed as patients, asked for the doctor’s registration number and other details and found them fake. He had been treating patients since 1989 and had opened the chamber at Jadavpur six years ago on the ground floor of his rented home where he lived with his wife.
“I posed as a patient suffering from chest and belly pain. The doctor checked my pressure and was writing me some medicines when I asked for his registration number. At first he was unwilling but later he wrote it on a piece of paper which I sent to a colleague waiting outside. He checked it on the Medical Council of India website and found no trace of any doctor with that registration number. We kept him engaged in further conversation as our other members called the cops,” said Tamal Kanti Ghosh, amember of Human Protection and Awareness Organisation.
 Officers of Jadavpur police station barged into his chamber-cum-rented home around 4.30pm and asked him to show relevant documents. The man, a graduate from Raj College in Burdwan, allegedly failed to produce any documents like MBBS certificate, MD certificate and DCH (diploma in child health) certificate. He had also identified himself as a former medical officer of Calcutta Medical College and NRS Hospitals.
 Cops booked Banerjee under IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or record). If proved guilty, he can be jailed for a maximum seven years.
