Margao: PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar on Friday said that in a meeting held last week, Union minister for shipping and water resources Nitin Gadkari had agreed to undertake the desilting of River Sal and its banks at a cost of Rs 200 crore. “Once done, this will benefit residents of low-lying areas which are prone to flooding,” he said. He said this while assuring residents of Benaulim and Seraulim of moving a proposal with the centre that the ongoing 4.5 kms Western Bypass be built on stilts to prevent flooding of their villages. A delegation of aggrieved villagers, led by Benaulim NCP MLA Churchill Alemao, met Dhavalikar in this regard.
