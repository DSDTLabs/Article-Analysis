KOZHIKODE: The rift between   and CPI over The Kerala   Law College land in Thiruvananthapuram has widened with the leaders of the major constituents of the ruling LDF expressing divergent views on the issue.

 While chief minister   categorically said that there was no question of reclaiming the land assigned to the academy, CPI state secretary   and minister for revenue P Chandrasekharan said an inquiry was on to find out whether the institution had misused the land.
 
 Talking to reporters here on Saturday Vijayan said, there would be no probe into the land dealings happened during the time of C P Ramaswamy Aiyer. “Many governments had come and gone after the land was given to the academy. Now it is not possible to inquire into those transactions,” he said. On V S Achuthanandan’s demand in this regard, Vijayan said. “There are many demands. I cannot respond to each and every one. I cannot intervene only because BJP leader V Muraleedharan was observing fast,” he said. Different sections including the media might have their own interests in the issue but the government was least interested in those issues, he added.
 
 However, Rajendran told media, “I don’t think the CM has said anything on the inquiry being conducted by the  . The inquiry is on the basis of a complaint from Achuthanandan.” He clarified that whether the land was used for the purpose it was handed over to the academy was being probed.
 
 Chandrasekharan told reporters in Kasaragod that the government would take a call after getting the inquiry report by revenue secretary.
