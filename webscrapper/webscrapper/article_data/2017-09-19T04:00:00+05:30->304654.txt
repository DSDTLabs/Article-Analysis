Vadodara: The 61-year-old woman from a remote village in Panchmahal, who surprised everyone by winning the district-level swimming competition in Khel Mahakumbh in Godhra on September 10 by participating without a swimming costume, has now been provided with one. She is also getting formal coaching for the competition. 

 Diwaliben Machhi, a native of nondescript Juni Dhari village, was encouraged by her family and villagers to participate in the competition as she was an expert swimmer in Mahi river that is around 100 metres from her residence. Machhi reached Sports Complex in Godhra town to participate in the competition along with other family members.
 
 Since Machhi did not have a swimming costume, she was initially denied permission. But the matter was referred to senior officials considering the determination of the woman and after long deliberations she was allowed to participate even when she did not have a costume.
 
 Machhi defeated competitors who were several years younger to her to win in the 50 metre butterfly event and stood second in the 50 metre breaststroke competition.
 
 Senior coach of the district coaching centre Pratap Pasaya has been taking keen interest in Machhi’s training. “We were all surprised and very happy for her. We have started giving coaching to her. I also got her a swimming costume and give her money to commute to and fro from the sports complex,” said Pasaya.
 
 Pasaya said cases like Machhi were very rare in rural areas. Machhi has already started using her costume and is practising regularly. Those training her are hopeful that she will do well in the state-level competition too.
