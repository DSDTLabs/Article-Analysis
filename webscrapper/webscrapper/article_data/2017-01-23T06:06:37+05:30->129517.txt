BENGALURU: A 16-year-old student allegedly killed himself after jumping off the third floor of his hostel room on the campus of   in Kumaraswamy Layout,  , on Sunday morning. 

 Jahnul Alam, a first-year pre-university commerce student, was from Assam and his parents are in Mumbai. He opened the window of his hostel room and leapt to his death. The boy is suspected to have taken the extreme step after the college authorities reportedly summoned Alam's parents after a number of complaints were raised against him. The parents were expected to arrive on Monday to meet the authorities. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (south) SD Sharanappa said they have registered a case of unnatural death and are investigating.
 
 "We've recovered a suicide note during investigation. It is early to reveal its contents. We are waiting for the boy's family to shed light on the suspected reason behind the suicide," he said. 
 
 Hostel warden   said Alam was staying in the seven-storey NRI hostel on the college campus. The hostel housed around 500 students. The warden said there were complaints he had borrowed money from friends.
 
 "A complaint claimed he had broken into his friend's cupboard to steal money. Following similar complaints, we wrote to his parents who were expected to arrive here on Monday," the warden said.
 
  Alam was alone in his room when he took the fatal plunge. Passersby on the campus saw him and rushed him to   next door where he was declared dead. From the hospital, the body was transferred to KIMS Hospital for postmortem, police sources added.
