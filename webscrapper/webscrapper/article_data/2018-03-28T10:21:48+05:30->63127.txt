CHENNAI: The ruling   government should approach the   against the issuance of environmental clearance to the   project in Theni and till further orders the project should not be allowed to be implemented, DMK working president M K   said here on Tuesday.

 In a statement, he said ever since the project was announced, it had faced opposition from various quarters. The BJP government’s decision to give clearance for the project by ignoring all the opposition was condemnable, said Stalin.
 
 Terming the center’s attitude as autocratic, he said the center had given clearance for a project which would affect the livelihood of people and the ground water source in the region. No public hearing was held for this purpose, he said. Above all, water for the project would be drawn from Mullaiperiyar reservoir, which would affect   people, he said.
 
 He said authorities should make it clear whether the central government had held discussions with the state government before giving clearance for the project that would endanger the lives of people in the state.
 
 If the state government had not expressed reservations about the project, both chief minister Edappadi K Palanisamy and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam would be held responsible, he said.
 
 As per the order, the project proponent has to obtain clearance from the state pollution control board. So the state pollution control board should not issue its clearance to the proposal, he said.
