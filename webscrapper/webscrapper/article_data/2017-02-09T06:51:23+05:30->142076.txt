BALLARI: Form er Kudligi deputy superintendent of police Anupama Shenoy and   M Rajashekar were quizzed by CID sleuths on Wednesday as part of investigations into the sex CD case involving former minister HY Meti. 

  While it is not known why Shenoy was questioned by the agency, according to sources police are trying to ascertain who filmed the CD. 
 
  It may be recalled that the case witnessed many twists, with the victim initially denying the episode and later claiming that she was threatened to be a part of it. Even, Meti's gunman  , who was allegedly involved, has gone underground. 
 
  Speaking to reporters later, Shenoy said: "It's a coincidence. I have no any role in the CD case. The government and some others are trying to defame and demoralize me. Today, I was questioned by the CID in the Meti episode, which points to the fact that my chances of being reappointed to government service are slim." Shenoy displa yed papers on her correspondence with the Election Commission, Anti-Corruption Bureau, home department and the chief minister. "I will released some documents on Thursday," she said.
