Music composer Bijibal’s wife and dancer Santhi Mohandas’ untimely departure from the world had left everyone in utter dismay and shock. There might not even be a Malayali, who might have not said that their heart goes out to   and his family, and also expressed their condolences to them. 

 Bijibal finally opened up about the irrevocable loss, and he penned down rather an emotional post on his social networking page. One can notice that he was in no way bemoaning, but was celebrating their relationship, saying both their lives are so entwined that it will surpass the boundaries of the mortal world and will always continue to be surreal indeed.
