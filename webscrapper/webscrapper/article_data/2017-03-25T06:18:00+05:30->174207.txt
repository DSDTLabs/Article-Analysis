Kolkata: Trouble again broke out at RG Kar Medical College and   on Thursday night, when a junior doctor was assaulted after a patient died. However, before the scene could turn ugly, the police swung into action and arrested the attacker, a relative of the deceased. 

 In protest against the assault, junior doctors took out a rally on Friday. 
 
 At the centre of the incident was a patient from Burtolla, who was on Thursday afternoon brought to the hospital in a serious condition, short on breath, semi-conscious and intoxicated. After examining him at the emergency ward, the doctors admitted him to the male ward around 12.45pm and reportedly started his treatment. But around 8.30pm, he died.
 
 As the news reached them, the patient’s family alleged that he died of medical negligence as after being admitted, doctors did not even bother to check on him. One of the relatives, Samir Mallick, who was in the ward, turned on the junior doctor on duty, Dr Subhadip, and assaulted him. But before the post-graduate doctor was injured much, police from the outpost ran inside the ward and hauled Mallick away. He was later arrested.
 
 “Prompt action by the police prevented the scene from going out of control. Security measures need to be tightened. We will hold a meeting with senior police officers on Saturday to discuss security matters,” said Dr S Batabyal, principal at RG Kar College and Hospital. 
 
 Junior Doctors’ Unity, a forum of junior doctors, took out a rally on Friday to condemn the attack and to show solidarity with the movement by doctors in Maharashtra. The protesters assembled at SSKM Hospital and demanded security cover for junior doctors, who often faced the ire of patients’ families. “Junior doctors are often at the receiving end for no fault of theirs. These attacks will never stop unless steps, such as improving the infrastructure and enhancing manpower, are taken up,” said Dr Sujan Ghosh, convenor of Junior Doctors’ Unity, West Bengal.
