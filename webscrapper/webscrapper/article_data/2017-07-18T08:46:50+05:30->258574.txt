BAREILLY: Bareilly Development Authority (BDA) will be allotting around 250 flats to   (EWS) across the district under Prime Minister Awasiya Yojna. Officials at BDA said a   will be engaged in the construction work of 250 flats on the outskirts of the city. The cost of one flat is estimated to be around Rs 5 lakh and will be equally borne by government and private builder.

  According to officials at BDA, while the civic body will not be engaged in any construction work under the scheme, it will be responsible for approving the plan of the new flats.
 
  Speaking with TOI, assistant engineer, Bareilly Development Authority, RK Singh said that EWS people will be allotted these two-bedroom houses with kitchen and bathroom. The cost of each unit will be borne by the government and the private builder. Rupees 1 lakh will be paid by the state government while the central government will pay Rs 1.5 lakh.‚Äù
  
 The private builder will be given several benefits by the government in return for the sum he spends for constructing the flats. The benefits include increase in floor area ratio (FAR) from 1.5 to 3.5. They will get a discount in land use conversion charges and external development charges will be lowered. At present, the builder needs to pay conversion charges for converting agricultural land into commercial. This will also be reduced for them by the government, officials said.
  
 When asked about the location of the land where these houses will be built, Singh said this is yet to be finalized. However, it is expected that the flats will be constructed on the outskirts of the city. The civic authority has initiated a survey of the land in areas like Parsakhera, Nadausi and Sannaiya on the outskirts of the city.
 
  Officials said the work for identifying those eligible for the flats will be carried out by the   (DUDA).
