AHMEDABAD: The first ever   (TBM) for constructing the approximately 6km   on the   and   will be operationalised in two days. The engineering firm, Afcons Infrastructure has lowered large parts of the S-710 TBM onto a cradle beneath the ground at the Apparel park metro station in the last week of February.

 It’s a 12 metre deep shaft which has been constructed on the west side of what is called the East Ramp of the underground tunnel. Senior MEGA officials say that in the coming months two TBMs will be operationalised for constructing four tunnels between East Ramp – Kankaria East Station up to Kalupur railway station on the 6.83 km underground section of Ahmedabad metro rail route. In the first half of the works two tunnels, about 1.7km long will be constructed. The whole project costs nearly Rs 784.8 crore for constructing a 2.65km long underground tunnel—which is called package-1 of the construction. 
 
 Parts of the two TBMs arrived in Ahmedabad on November 30 last year from Chennai where they were commissioned to build tunnels over a distance of approximately four kilometres between Washermenpet and central stations. “Our main challenge will be the walled area, which is today a world heritage city. Our efforts will be to minimise vibrations and chalk out an efficient traffic management plan,” said a senior MEGA official. Construction work for the TBM’s diaphragm wall had began in July last. MEGA then completed their soil excavation work immediately towards the end of November. It was after this that the TBMs are being lowered.
