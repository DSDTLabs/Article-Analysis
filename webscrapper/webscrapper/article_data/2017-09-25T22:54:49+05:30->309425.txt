Meerut: Government pharmacists observed World Pharmacists Day on Monday, even as they continued to grapple with the shortage of essential drugs, which was as low as 50% in Meerut district having a population of over 34 lakh. Anil Kaushik, officer-in-charge, pharmacy, PL Sharma district hospital, said: “There are some 400 essential drugs, out of which only 150 are available in Meerut. A proposal has been prepared for 70 other drugs and their procurement is in the pipeline. There is a shortage of 50% essential drugs. Though these are not life-saving drugs but are important in day today’s life.”  According to some pharmacists, the main reason behind the shortage is that the state government authorities have selected only one company for one drug.  “It creates monopoly and makes the procurement difficult. As only one company is given the task of supplying one drug, it creates monopoly of that company and makes the procurement of medicines difficult, since we are not left with any other choice.  "For instance, a requirement of 50 lakh Paracetamol tablets is there in Meerut district every three months, but we have a stock of hardly 10 lakh tablets for three months,” said VK Singh, president of Diploma Pharmacists Association, Meerut.  Dr. PK Bansal, superintendent-in-chief, PL Sharma district hospital, who was the chief guest at the programme organized for the day at office of Meerut chief medical officer, said, “All the pharmacists are free to approach me in case of any problem. Those serving the people in remote areas at the primary health centres and community health centres should treat their work as a service to the poor and be humble in their behavior towards them.”  The pharmacists also cited security as one of the major problems.  “There are cases when the locals thrash doctors and pharmacists for no fault of theirs. Security is a major problem and should be taken care of by government authorities,” said Singh.
