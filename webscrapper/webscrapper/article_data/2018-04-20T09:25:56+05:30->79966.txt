MADURAI: The   bench of the Madras high court on Thursday directed the authorities to conduct the fire walk (pookuzhi) festival at the Arulmigu Mariamman temple in   in Virudhunagar district.

 The division bench of justices C T   and A M   gave this direction on a petition filed by one N S Ramaraj from Rajapalayam.
 
 The court was told that the temple has been in existence from time immemorial. Every year, the annual fire walk festival would take place there, in which thousands of people would attend.
 
 For the festival, devotees would start their fasting by tying a sacred thread on their hand. Accordingly, it was scheduled to be conducted from April 19 to April 30 this year, about which an announcement was also made. It led many devotees to start their fasting. 
 
 Due to dispute between two communities, the special officer of the temple had stopped the festival by issuing a prohibitory order. Due to that the devotees who started fasting were unable to complete it. Hence, it was necessary to issue direction to the special officer to hold festival as per schedule.
