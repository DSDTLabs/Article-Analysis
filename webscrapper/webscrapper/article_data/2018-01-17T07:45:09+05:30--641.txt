AHMEDABAD: Amid the boom and bust of the global startup scenario, the International Centre for   and Technology (iCreate) — a pet project of PM   — aims to create an ecosystem for budding entrepreneurs with help ranging from grooming to funding. Modi along with Israeli counterpart   will visit iCreate on January 17 and dedicate the autonomous Centre of Excellence to the nation.

 The event will also have an awards ceremony for the India-Israel Global Innovation Challenge 2017. Of about 1,000 entries, 36 winning teams — 18 each from India and Israel — will be awarded in three categories. The PMs will also inaugurate a two-day Startup Fair, consisting of about 50 startups from   in fields of IT, Internet of Things and engineering. The PMs are also expected to interact with a group of entrepreneurs.
