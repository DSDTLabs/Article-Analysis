SAHARSA: The Bihar government has finally decided to declare the complex of twin archaeological sites at Mahishi village in   --   and Shree Ugrataara Temple -- as a protected site. 

 The demand for protection of the ancient monuments is over four decades old. Assurances from officials apart, chief minister   also dropped a hint about it at the first Ugratara Mahotsav years back.
 
 The state art and culture department has directed the Mahishi circle officer to display notices at the complex and invite objections, if any, from local people within two months to the government’s intentions to declare the complex as a protected site.
 
 Locals hoped the Archaeological Survey of India after the state government’s initiative would do the needful to save the artefacts and historical evidence at the complex from decay due to the flood ravages of Koshi.
 
 Mahishi is widely acclaimed as a Shaktipeetha. In view of frequent recovery of antiquities of the Maurya period from the village, several historians have been demanding excavation of Mahishi and adjoining villages.
