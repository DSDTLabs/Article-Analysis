NEW DELHI: The   (RTE) may have improved enrollment in schools, but a large number of students stop schooling right after the guaranteed   under RTE Act ends at the age of 14. This is one of the key findings of the Annual School Education Report (ASER-Rural) released on Tuesday.

 The drop in enrollment is sharper for girl students. A reason for the dropout could also be the ‘no detention’ policy under which students cannot be failed until class 8. This is the first time that ASER has surveyed students older than 14.
 
 The survey shows that while only 4.7% males and 5.7% females at age 14 were not enrolled in a school, at age 18 the percentage of male students out of school shoots up to 27.8 and for female students, the figure is 32.1%.
 
 While the survey found 42% of all youth to be working, 76.8% of males and 89.4% females were involved in household work. The study found 79% of the people to be involved in agriculture, almost all on family farmland.
 
 Professional aspirations, according to the report, were also gendered. While most men were interested in joining the army, the police or becoming engineers, females showed a preference for careers in teaching or nursing.
