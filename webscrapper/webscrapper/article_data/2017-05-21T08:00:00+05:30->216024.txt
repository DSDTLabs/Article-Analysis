SHIMLA: Hotels and guest houses in   of tribal   are bearing deserted look these days despite the opening of   as district administration in Kullu is not allowing the tourists coming from outside to enter the valley by denying them permits.

Thakur added that following NGT restrictions, no one can cross Rohtang pass and reach Lahaul without presenting the permit or other valid documents. “We are being given assurances that road will be opened within 2-3 days, however we are still awaiting the opening of road for tourist vehicles,” he said.
 
 He said hotel association and travel agents of Lahaul-Spiti have approached him with a request to ensure that tourist vehicles be allowed to visit Lahaul-Spiti as soon as possible. He said besides taking up the matter with state government and Border Roads Organisation officials, he would also bring the issue to the notice of chief minister   as tourism is the livelihood of hundreds of people in the district.
 
 “In addition I have also requested the government to give directions to district administration for arrangements of police and other logistics on both sides of Rohtang Pass so that smooth operation of tourist flow is carried out,” he said.
