HYDERABAD: In a significant finding, ‘The Threatened Taxa of   Report’ has revealed that 150 species of plants, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including plants having anti-cancer properties as well as the  , are threatened in Telangana.

 
 Governor ESL Narasimhan on Tuesday released the report which observed that several plant species endemic to Telangana are critically endangered. Rapid urbanisation, habitat loss, excess collection of medicinal plants and pollution are said to be pushing the species into danger.
 
 Interestingly, species like Ledebouria hyderabadensis that has anti-cancer properties are among the critically endangered. The species is endemic to Greater Hyderabad.
 
 Osmania University professor Dr  , principal investigator of the TToTS project, told TOI, “Of the 56 species of plants assessed, around 11% are endemic to Telangana. Three species — Cyathocline manilaliana, Ledebouria hyderabadensis and Polycarpaea corymbosa variety Yadagiriense from   — have been assessed as critically endangered. Most of the plant species assessed are threatened by habitat loss, over-collection for medicinal purposes and livestock grazing.”
 
 Among animals, the longbilled vulture and Roux’s Forest Lizard are among the critically endangered. “The fish diversity of Telangana is under threat of extinction due to overfishing. Introduction of major carps into the rivers and reservoirs has led to competition for resources, threatening local species. The amphibian diversity is affected due to decline in habitat quality, pollution in water bodies and mortality due to vehicular traffic,” Srinivasulu said.
 
 The experts did the analysis based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List guidelines. “All the taxa known from 31 districts of Telangana were collected and assessed. Species endemic to Telangana were assessed with a series of workshops attended by researchers and experts,” Srinivasulu said.
