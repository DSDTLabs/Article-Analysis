PUNE: The feud in veteran Congressman Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil’s family came to the fore on Wednesday, barely two months after his death.

 Balasaheb’s elder son, Ashok  , has accused his brother and leader of opposition in the Assembly, Radhakrishna, of illegally grabbing an educational institute and working in collusion with BJP leaders. Ashok has slapped a legal notice on Radhakrishna over the control of the institute.
 
 Balasaheb died on December 30, 2016. Addressing a press conference in Pune, Ashok Vikhe-Patil, who is not active in politics, said, “My brother, Radhakrishna, used his influence in the charity commissioner’s office to get elected as the chairman of   — an educational institute started by our father — when I had gone abroad recently. Also, Radhakrishna is the leader of opposition in the Assembly with blessings of BJP leaders.”
 
 Balasaheb had joined BJP for a brief period in 2001. He later returned to Congress.
 
 Ashok said his father, who was Union minister of state for finance in 2001, had helped BJP president Amit Shah in a case related to Ahmedabad’s Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank, plagued with alleged fraud and misappropriation of public funds.
 
 “Balasaheb had a good relationship with BJP leaders and that is why the party assisted Radhakrishna to become the leader of opposition. It is a return gift by BJP and so he is not taking a tough stand against the party. Chief minister Fadnavis and the leader of opposition are hand in glove,” said Ashok Vikhe-Patil.
 
 Vikhe-Patils rule the roost in Ahmednagar district politics with strong control over sugar cooperatives and various education institutes. 
 
 Family sources close to Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil told TOI the leader was unwilling to speak to the media on this, saying it was a “family matter” and would be resolved within the family.
