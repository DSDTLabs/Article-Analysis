Taking strict cognizance of fake messages doing the rounds on instant messaging apps like WhatsApp about an expected “cyclone” on Wednesaday afternoon, BMC   Ajoy Mehta sent out a hard-hitting letter to the joint commissioner of police, law and order, asking that strict action be initiated against those who spread wrong and dangerous information.

 The social media was abuzz on Wednesday about a “cyclone” that was to hit the city around 3pm, and that   and Pedder Road had been shut to traffic to counter the “calamity”. Mehta has requested the police to hunt down those who spread false information and take action against them under Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The section deals with punishment for spreading false information, according to which whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning about a disaster or its severity or magnitude that causes panic will be punished with up to one year imprisonment or with fine. Senior police officials TOI spoke to said they are yet to receive the letter. Further action would be taken on the basis of the letter, they said. 
 
 K S Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), IMD, said they start monitoring a   seven-10 days in advance and warnings based on its position are issued three-four days in advance. “There is a well-placed warning system for cyclones and the messages doing rounds on Wednesday were completely untrue,” he said.
