JAIPUR: Several people near Badarwas area of the city on Saturday surrounded and pelted stones at four trucks, following rumours that these vehicles allegedly transporting cows to slaughter houses.

  police reached the area to take stock of the situation and control the angry mob. However, when these vehicles were searched, it was found that buffaloes and calves were being ferried to Uttar Pradesh for domestic purpose and rumour of cow slaughtering went pointless.
 
 “Residents gheraoed the trucks and tried to take law into their own hands. They didn’t inform police. We have detained a few people and arrested three truck drivers under animal cruelty act,” said  ,   (ACP), Mansarovar, adding that people were booked for creating public nuisance.
 
 The incident reportedly took place at 9.30 am on Saturday when few people spread rumours about some vehicles carrying cows entering Badrwas. The angry residents stopped the trucks, punctured their tyres and even pelted stones. Panic gripped the area as some miscreants tried to stop the moving vehicle. 
 
 The pandemonium lasted for half an hour and ended only when a team of cops reached. Cops found these animals were cramped into trucks and were taken to Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “Nobody is allowed to take law and order in their hands. We dispersed the crowd and took all of them to police station. We have not found any evidence of cow slaughtering as speculated by some people. Truck drivers have been arrested under offences for animal cruelty whereas people who created ruckus have also been detained,” a police official said, adding that situation was under control.
