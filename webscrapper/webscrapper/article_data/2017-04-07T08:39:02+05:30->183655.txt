COIMBATORE: A 35-year-old man was beaten to death at an apartment complex on the outskirts of the city by students of a private engineering college. Police said that the students suspected the man to be a thief. 

 The deceased, identified as S Michael  , was a native of Kootapuli village near   in Tirunelveli district. Police have detained two third year BE (mechatronics) students studying in a private engineering college. However, family members of the deceased claimed that more than 12 students assaulted him and demanded that police conduct a detailed probe into the case.
 
 Police said Liberty reached Coimbatore on Wednesday and visited Valayapuri Nagar at Kurumbapalayam. Students of a private engineering college who were staying in an apartment at Valayapuri Nagar allegedly spotted him trying to burgle a flat and beat him up severely inside the apartment complex. On being informed, the building owner S  , 69, rushed to the spot and found that the man had died.
 
 Ramasamy alerted Kovilpalayam police who sent the body to the   and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem. Based on Ramasamy's complaint, police registered a case under section 174 CrPC (suspicious death). The building owner stated in the complaint that the students told him that the deceased had gone to a flat and stolen a mobile phone. The complaint added that when he was noticed, Liberty allegedly jumped off the first floor to escape and suffered injuries before he was beaten up.
 
 Relatives of the deceased refused to receive the dead body and demanded that police register a case under section 302 (murder) of the IPC. Kovilpalayam police subsequently altered the section to 302 of the IPC and a postmortem was carried out. On Thursday afternoon, the family members received the body.
 
 Police picked up two students - S  , 20, of Ramar Kottai in Dharmapuri district and Y Antony, 20, of Thangachi Madam near Rameswaram - for inquiry in connection with the case. Further investigations are on.
