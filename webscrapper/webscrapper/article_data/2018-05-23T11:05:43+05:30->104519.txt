AMRITSAR: Blaming the Punjab government for allegedly shielding the people responsible for desecration and theft of Guru   in Bargari and   villages respectively, the Sarbat Khalsa-appointed jathedars have called for a panthic gathering at Bargari on June 1. They said it was time to take some ‘decisive decisions’ and force the government to put the culprits behind bars.

 
 Sarbat Khalsa-appointed Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar   said, “Three years ago on June 1, 2015 and October 12, 2015, Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and torn pages of the holy book were found in Bargari village but none of the people responsible for blasphemy has been arrested so far.”
 
 Alleging that the government was testing Sikhs’ patience, Daduwal said time had come to take some crucial decisions. “We will contemplate on the issue with Sikh bodies and announce our next course of action that will force the government to arrest the culprits,” he said.
 
  president   alleged that during all these years both the SAD and the   governments had formed special investigation teams (SITs), held inquiries and set up commissions only as eyewash attempts to dissuade panthic organizations.
