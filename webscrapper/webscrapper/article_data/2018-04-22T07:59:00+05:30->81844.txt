GURUGRAM: Union minister of state and Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh on Saturday said the location of Gurugram’s first government-run   has been decided. The panchayat of   village, which is barely metres away from  , has proposed giving eight acres of land for the project.

 The minister added that the proposal, put forward by the panchayat two weeks ago, is being forwarded from the state government to the Centre. A team from the Union ministry of health and family welfare is likely to survey the land soon. “The initiative of the panchayat to offer its land for the development of the trama centre is appreciated and is the will of the people,” Singh said.
 
 He further said Union health minister  , who had announced a trauma centre would be set up for Gurugram in his visit in February, is serious in seeing the project through.
 
 “The proposed location is also appropriate because Kukrola is close to both the Delhi-Jaipur expressway (NH-8) and the KMP expressway,” Singh said, adding that it would benefit people in the accident cases on the stretch. 
 
 The village is 2km away from the intersection of KMP and Delhi-Jaipur expressways in Pachgaon.
 
 Gurugram witnessed 115 deaths and 273 injuries in 286 accidents between January and March 2018.The district recorded the highest number of accidents in the state (1,214) in 2017. 
 
 Most of the serious accident trauma cases are referred to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, which causes delay when time is precious.
 
 “It would be nice if the government also engaged paramedical services and brought in more ambulances, as a trauma centre alone won’t be able to tackle the problem. The first few minutes of an accident are critical, and attention is needed at that time,” said a senior traffic official.
