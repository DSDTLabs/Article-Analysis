  Vineet Yadav, assistant commissioner, FSDA, Agra said, “The joint raid of FSDA and police was conducted at a house in Kukhreliya village under Barhan police station. A large quantity of adulterants was found while one woman was caught red-handed making synthetic milk.”

Besides round 67 litre of refined soyabean oil, 22 kg of vanaspati, two litre of liquid detergent, 72 kg of glucose powder, 34 kg of skimmed milk powder, 325 litre of unidentified chemical, 35 kg of viscous paste and 56 litre of refined palmoline oil were also seized, the official added.
  
  From milk, sauce, pickles to spices, Agra has emerged as a major hub of food adulteration in the region. Last month, the FSDA special team had conducted a surprise raid and seized more than 300 litres of adulterated milk from Nari village under Dauki police jurisdiction.
  
  A stronghold of the milk mafia, remote areas like Dauki, Kheragarh and Barhan have a huge market of synthetic/adulterated milk production.
  
  Yadav has formed a special squad to deal with adulteration which has been on the rise over a period of time. “The team first gathers enough evidence before conducting a raid. We do not believe in collecting just samples. The members pose as cattle buyers/sellers and merchants to unearth such activities,” he informed.
