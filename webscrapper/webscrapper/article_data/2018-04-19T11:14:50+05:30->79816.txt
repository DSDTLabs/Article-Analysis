BELAGAVI: The filing of nominations for 2018 assembly elections has begun in   district. While most candidates are waiting for an auspicious time to file their papers,   Satish Jarkiholi has announced that he'd file his nomination during  , a period considered inauspicious for any new venture according to Indian Vedic astrology.

 
 "I want to remove the fear of Rahu Kalam from the minds of people by filing my nomination at that time and winning the elections. This initiative is part of my yearslong campaign to eradicate superstitions," Jarkiholi said.
 
 Jarkiholi became popular with his graveyard-stay programmes organized in Belagavi city during death anniversaries of BR Ambedkar.
 
 "I believe there is no time like auspicious or inauspicious. Success or failure depends on the deeds, efforts and confidence of individuals. If I have done good work in my constituency, I will win even if I file my nomination during Rahu Kalam," he said.
 
 Jarkiholi, an   secretary, purchased a private helicopter two months ago. He said he won't campaign in his constituency and will instead work for his party candidates in other parts of the state.
