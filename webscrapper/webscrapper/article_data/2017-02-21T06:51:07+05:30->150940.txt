NAGPUR: Despite being deployed for more than 24 hours in bandobast to ensure fair and free polling on Tuesday, cops were deprived of  , including  , water and proper hygiene at the poll booth. However, city top cops have assured that those deployed at booths would be provided with the best facilities.

 Thousands of cops, including  , have been deployed to maintain the security from the day before of the elections till the shifting of ballets to the centres after the polling which would end up on Tuesday late in the night. Cops were asked to present at the booth on Monday at 7am sharp. But they were not provided with tea and breakfast which would boost up their energy. 
 
 Sources from the cops sections informed, “It was not the first time when we didn’t get facilities on  . Now we are used to of it. Hence, we carried our beddings and other requirements with us.” But there were several other problems too, including no supply of drinking water and unhygienic toilets, which mainly affect women cops, they added. 
 
 Women cops are less in numbers, in result, sometimes they left alone among male cops. Few women cops told TOI, “They feel uncomfortable while sharing their problems with their male counterparts due to communication gap.” However, one of the senior cops told TOI, “Cops were trained to overcome every kind of challenge in their tough times. They have to predetermine the hindrances coming their way to give their best.” The staffs, who were deployed on polling duty, would be replaced by other staffs on counting day, senior cop added.
 
 “We assured that every cop would be provided with food packets and also with the basic amenities,” CP K Venkatesh told TOI.
