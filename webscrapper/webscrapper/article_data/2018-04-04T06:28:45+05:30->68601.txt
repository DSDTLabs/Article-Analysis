BENGALURU
 The high court has said a man cannot deny maintenance to his children citing harassment meted out to him by his estranged wife.

 It dismissed a Bengalurean’s petition challenging the family court’s directive to him to pay Rs 10,000 each as monthly maintenance to his two daughters. The high court said the children have nothing to do with divorce proceedings between their parents.
 
 Describing the father’s contentions as unjustified, Justice Raghvendra S Chauhan said: “It is rather surprising that the petitioner, who earns a monthly salary of Rs 1,08,000, claims that maintenance of Rs 20,000 is too much of a burden on him. It is the legal and moral duty of the petitioner (father) to maintain both his daughters. Moreover, poverty is no defence when the question is of maintenance to be paid to children.” 
 
 The petitioner had said he couldn’t afford to pay Rs 20,000 every month. He claimed since his wife continued to harass him, the children were not entitled to receive maintenance.
 
 The petitioner and the respondent married on October 26, 2002, in a Christian ceremony. On February 28, 2007, their first daughter was born and on May 20, 2013, they had their second daughter. However, owing to differences they soon parted ways and on February 4, 2017, the husband filed a divorce petition citing cruelty by his wife. The wife, who currently stays in Mumbai, also filed an application seeking monthly maintenance of Rs 60,000 and Rs 50,000 towards litigation expenses. However, the husband opposed the application. On January 9, 2018, the family court directed him to pay Rs 10,000 each as monthly maintenance to his daughters.
