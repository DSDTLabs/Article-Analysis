Trichy: As small and minor millets require minimal effort compared to paddy and other crops, farmers can reap high benefits if they opt for it, says the agriculture department, Trichy. Without putting much effort on its cultivation from sowing to harvesting, they can easily reap 1,000 kg of   per acre, the joint director of agriculture, S M Uduman Mohideen, told TOI. 

 In Trichy district, maize has been cultivated in some parts like Thuraiyur, Thottiam and T Pettai. However, it was very meagre. Since the crop also requires considerable amount of water, many farmers who took to maize cultivation had incurred losses in the last few years. Millet needed only moisture and not water at the time of sowing. It was enough to irrigate the crop during the middle of the day in scorching sunlight. Otherwise the crop did not require much attention.
 
 “It will grow as wild grass without requiring as much attention as needed for paddy. When compared to paddy, millet crops need less than 25 per cent water for its whole period. Besides, there is no threat from pest. With such kind of attention, a farmer can easily get 1,000 kilogram of the grain from one acre”, he further said. 
 
 “Millets being the new favourite of the health conscious, people have started flocking to shops where organic products and millets are available. Hotels serving food prepared with millets are witnessing good footfalls nowadays. These developments have changed the mindset of farmers and they have started thinking of cultivating millets”, said secretary of ‘Thanneer’, a voluntary organisation, K C Neelamegam.
