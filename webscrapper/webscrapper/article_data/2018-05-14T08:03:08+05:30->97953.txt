MYSURU: Incessant rainfall and   over the past week across South Karnataka have hit   prices hard. Prices of all varieties of mangoes in Mysuru district have crashed by Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg. 

 “Badam variety mango, which was earlier selling at Rs 80 per kg, is now selling at Rs 60. Rasapuri mango prices have come down from Rs 70 to Rs 50. Sindhura and Mallika variety mangoes are selling at Rs 40 per kg,” said Mahesh of Vinayaka Marketing, a dealer in mangoes. 
 
 P Prakash, senior farm superintendent, University of Agricultural Sciences, Naganahalli, said multiple reasons are responsible for price crash. “Generally mangoes fall due to gusty winds. These fallen mangoes are sent to the market. They fetch less money as they are poor in quality. Eventually such poor quality mangoes bring down the prices of the entire stock and lead to price fluctuation,” he said.
 
 He also pointed out that increased mango supply to the market may be another reason for prices to fall. As expected, the growers are at the receiving end. They feel that if rain continues it will have a major impact on mango output and the price. Gowtham Prabhu, a mango orchard owner from the Nanjanagud said that if rain continues, mangoes will develop black spots. “One or two spells of rain is good for mangoes. But this year the district is receiving rainfall continuously which is a cause of worry,” he said.
