Tiruvannamalai: The Tiruvannamalai district administration has instructed all government departments and private firms with more than 10 employees to constitute an internal complaints committee (ICC) to look into the complaints of sexual harassments against women at work place.

 Collector K S Kandasamy, in a press statement, said the committee should be constituted within a week and a report submitted to the district social welfare officer.
 
 Officials said the committee would probe into the sexual harassment complaints by women and take appropriate measures as per the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (prevention, prohibition and redressal) Act 2013. 
 
 “If the complainant is not satisfied with the inquiry, they can approach the local inquiry committee (LIC),” said district social welfare officer Chistina Dorthy.
 
 In the absence of ICC, the women can approach the LIC headed by the district collector. “We have sent communication to all the government departments and private firms to submit reports on the formation of the committee within a week,” she added.
 
 She said instructions have also been sent to the non-registered children and girls homes and hostels in the district. “As of now, there are a total of 21 registered children and girls homes in the district,” she added.
