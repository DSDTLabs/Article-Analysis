HYDERABAD: It was perhaps rain that was forecast which made skipper   chase down a target, but he was vindicated as   came up with a top-notch performance to get their IPL-XI campaign off to a winning start.

 
 
 
 
 With unseasonal rain that battered the city over the last two days mercifully staying away, the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium witnessed the Sunrisers complete a nine-wicket win by finishing at 127 for one, Shikhar Dhawan (77 no; 57b, 13x4, 6x1) and Williamson (36 no; 35b, 4x3, 6x1) complementing the fine show of their bowlers, who had restricted   to 125 for nine on Monday.
 
 It was a total Rajasthan struggled to put together largely due to their own lack of enterprise - there were only 12 boundaries - in their innings that lacked thrust at the top and suffered for want of momentum thereafter.
 
 For a change, SRH spearhead   was unsuccessful in the first spell and conceded a few. But Rajasthan still struggled to break free of the shackles imposed by the tall Billy Stanlake, left-arm spinner   (2/23), bowling in the powerplays, Afghan leggie   and the successful Siddharth Kaul (2/17). All of them barely got a sighter, one over each at a time, but the effect was telling on the opposition batsmen.
 
 Rajasthan were 48 for one in first six overs and the loss of skipper   in the seventh over did not help their cause. Rahane added 46 runs for the second wicket with   but failed to beat Rashid covering good ground to his left to take a fine catch at midwicket.
 
 That the second wicket partnership was the highest in the innings was an indication of the struggle Rajasthan went through on a wicket where the ball came on nicely.
