Mysuru: Nanjangud’s Hemmargala village grew tense after Dalit Sangarsha Samithi ( ) members held a protest to condemn the disfiguring of Dr BR Ambedkar’s photograph on the name board of an organization, by smearing it with cow dung. 

 Activists of the Jai Bhim Yuvakara Sangha found that some miscreants spoilt Ambedkar’s image on their association name board and also tried to set the board afire late on Thursday. The activists, led by DSS taluk convener Nagendra Basavattige, Krishnamurthy, Kiran, Prashantha and Mahadevaswamy, condemned it and demanded the arrest of the wrongdoers. 
 
 The incident happened a day after verbal duels between two groups of youths from different communities of the village over a trivial issue, near the Ayurveda hospital in the village. The activists suspect the youths involved in the duel late on Thursday disfigured the name board. 
 
 The protesters, after submitting a memorandum to tahsildar Dayanand, lodged a complaint with Kaulande police who are camping in the village as a precaution.
 
 Dayananda said the Jai Bheem activists protested the disfigurement and demanded action. They gave a memorandum, holding a few youths responsible for the incident. Police are deployed at the village, where the situation is now peaceful.
