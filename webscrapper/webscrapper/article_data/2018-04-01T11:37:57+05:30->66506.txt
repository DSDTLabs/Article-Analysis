 starrer Punjabi biopic ‘Subedar Joginder Singh’ has been in news off late for all the right reasons. From the promising trailer to the grand music launch at the  , the movie is making headlines prior to its release. Now the makers have released the third song, ‘Hathyar’, which is kindling the fire of patriotism.

 In a scenario where intellects are debating on how Punjabi songs have been centered only around meaningless lyrics and objectification of women, the release of ‘Hathyar’ is like a breath of fresh air. It portrays the valor soldiers conceal in their hearts and the spark they carry in their eyes. The song beautifully depicts that army men fear none when it comes to their duty. They can go to any extent for saving the motherland; that their lives are not their priority but their nation is.
 
 Penned by Amrinder Singh Gill, the heartfelt song has been sung by Nachhatar Gill and the inspiring music is by Gurpreet Singh. In March, the makers of the movie released first two tracks, ‘Gal Dil Di’ and ‘Ishq Da Tara’. The former was a saga expressing the unexpressed emotions of the soldiers, while the later showed Subedar in a romantic light. The movie will hit the silver screen on April 6, 2018.
