AHMEDABAD: The ongoing exam season doesn’t seem to have affected the vacationing spirit of Gujaratis at all, and there has been a significant rise in travel bookings for the long weekend. 

 Travel operators say that a significant 35% rise in bookings this weekend, as against weekdays, makes it the most sought-for long weekend after   holidays. 
 
 Both local bookings for trips to places like Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur, Abu and Saputara, and for international destinations have gone up.
 
 “We’ve seen a significant 35% increase in travel bookings. Nearby destinations in Rajasthan such as Jodhpur, Jaipur or those around Gujarat including Diu, Daman and Sasan Gir, or even Goa, are extremely popular choices of travellers,” said Manish Sharma, a tour operator in Ahmedabad.
 
 International destinations are also seeing larger footfall from Gujarat. “Packages were available at affordable rates over the Easter long-weekend for   and Dubai and accordingly, the bookings have significantly gone up,” he added.
 
 Travel consultants claim that this is particularly a time for senior citizens and couples to travel, as they don’t want to be part of the crowd during summers. Most government officials have planned a long weekend getaway, said officials.
 
 “Long weekends are always a preferred trip time for most people. This is typically a time for senior citizens and ‘double income no kids’ (DINK) couples to travel, take a break from the routine and unwind,” said  , a city-based travel consultant.
 
 While road trips have gained traction among travellers, cab operators claim bookings have not been as buoyant. 
 
 “We’ve got limited bookings for sedan cars. There are no major bus bookings and people are not even hiring SUVs for family trips. Perhaps, it is due to exam season that families are refraining from travelling, while couples and youngsters are travelling often,” said  , a cab company owner in Ahmedabad.
