NAGPUR: The city is often referred to as the crime capital of the state, but the conviction rate may be the saving grace. The conviction rate in the district and sessions court has jumped from a dismal 25% to 38% in the last 15 months.

 From November 1, 2016, to February 15, 2107, the court disposed of 479 cases with convictions in 124 cases and acquittal in 355. “There was a 13% rise in convictions. Many convictions were under the   Act, as the public prosecutors worked hard to gather evidence and present the cases,” said district government pleader (DGP) Nitin Telgote at a press conference on Thursday. He was accompanied by additional public prosecutor  , Varsha Aglawe and other lawyers working on the DGP’s office.
 
 “In 2017, the court disposed of 364 cases with convictions in 92. Of these, three persons were found guilty under the Atrocities Act. A large number of convictions (32) were recorded in the 103 cases under the POCSO Act,” the DGP said.
 
 In the first one-and-a-half-months of this year, 45 cases were disposed of, in which accused were convicted in 12 cases, mostly related to POCSO Act. “There is a jump in orders to reject bail of accused, and we’ve made sure that dreaded goons, murderers and scamsters are not allowed to easily get bail. We’ve successfully pleaded cases of MPID Act, due to which accused like Wasankar family, Avinash Bhute, Deepak Bajaj, Santosh Lande and others, failed to come out of jail, as their bails pleas were not entertained,” Telgote added.
