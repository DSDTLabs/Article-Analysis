DHARAMSHALA: Police are struggling to quell the outrage poured over social media over the murder of a 20-year-old woman. In chilling similarity with the   gangrape and murder case, the body was recovered from a forest. This trigerred a barrage of criticism directed at the police and state government on social media. 

 Police did a   live from the headquarters, made public appeals and used WhatsApp to counter people’s claims, but to no avail. 
 
 Superintendent of police,   told TOI that facts were misrepresented. He said social media is flooded with baseless allegations of rape and murder.
 
 “I issued a public appeal through the public relations department and did a Facebook live besides using other mediums of social media to bring truth to the fore,” he said.
 
 Inquiries revealed that a special team has been appointed to tackle the situation. Police also appealed to social media users to check facts and spread word of the truth. The Facebook profile of   SP carried a live video of SP Santosh Patial. 
 
 But it failed to create an impact in the face of protests held in   and the native village of the deceased. Irate protesters demanded justice for the family. Later, the SP was forced to reach the spot and tackle protesters.
