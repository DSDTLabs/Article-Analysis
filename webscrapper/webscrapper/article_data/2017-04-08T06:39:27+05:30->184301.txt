AHMEDABAD: Three children, aged between 10 and 15 years, drowned in the Kharicut canal   on Friday afternoon. While the bodies of two boys were fished of the canal by Ahmedabad   (AFES), the operation continued till late in the night to find one missing girl. A total of six children had got into the canal to bathe, said investigators.

  AFES officials said they received a call from Dakshini Society near Maninagar at 12.30pm on Friday, about a search and rescue for the kids.
 
 “Subsequent questioning revealed that six kids — Ajay Thakor, 10, Anil Thakor, 15, Sandhya Rajbhar, 10, Anil Darbar, 10, Krishna Baviskar, 8, and Komal, 12— had entered the canal for a dip. All are residents of the shanties in   of Hatkeshwar-Bhaipura. All of their parents are labourers. They went to the canal to have a dip to beat the heat. They were not new to the canal, and used to hold on to a rope tied to a boundary pillar and get in. Today, however, the current stronger and they started to drown,” said Harshad Patel, a social worker from Amraiwadi.
 
 On hearing the cries of the children, people nearby rushed to the spot and threw saris and ropes in, and managed to save Anil, Krishna and Komal. The three others could not be found. AFES personnel were then called and the search began.
 
 “Ajay’s body was found near Vatva, and Anil’s at Isanpur. The firemen extended the search for Sandhya up to Aslali, but as of Friday night, there was no sign of her. The chances of her survival are slim, given the strong current,” said a senior AFES official.
 
 “Of the survivors, Krishna suffered head injuries and was been shifted to  . The others were given first aid,” said Nayan Brahmbhatt, the local municipal councillor.
