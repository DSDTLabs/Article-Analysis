THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The mystery behind the purchase of a 50-acre property in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu by vigilance director   on behalf of Kochi-based ISRA Agrotech Pvt Ltd in November 2001 has deepened further with documents showing that two Israeli citizens together hold 48.75% shares in the company and funded the controversial purchase in violation of the   Management Act (FEMA), 1999.

 TOI had reported earlier that Jacob Thomas had been holding the undisclosed property in violation of service rules. The audit reports and balance sheets of the company submitted to the ministry of corporate affairs, accessed by TOI, show that Israeli citizens Eliahu Bazalel and Eliahu Barak not only hold shares in the company (which would have been legal if it had not forayed into agriculture) but also lent funds to it.
 
 “As per the sanction received from secretariat for industrial assistance, department of industrial policy and promotion, ministry of commerce and industry, a sum of Rs 5 lakh was to be allotted as shares to the Israeli collaborators Mr Eliahu Bazalel and Mr Eliahu Barak. 
 
 However, shares were allotted to the above parties only to the extent of Rs 4,87,000. The excess amount of Rs 14,93,256 brought by them is treated as unsecured loan from the directors,” says the independent auditor’s report of ISRA Agrotech for 2012-13.
