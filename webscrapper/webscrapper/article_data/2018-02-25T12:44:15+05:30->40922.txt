BHUBANESWAR: Mudslinging over the pre-poll violence in   district intensified on Saturday as one of the four persons injured in an attack on labour minister  's brother Subrat died. The deceased - Dileswar alias Maagi Sahu - was Subrat's driver and he died at SCB Medical College and Hospital on Friday night. 

 Subrat and three of his associates were attacked near Banabira under Sohela block in the poll-bound Bijepur constituency on Thursday night. While BJD accused BJP of orchestrating the violence to win the byelection, BJP denied any involvement.
 
 "An innocent person has died because of BJP's dirty politics. Every conscious citizen should condemn the incident. We are distressed," BJD leader and former minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak said.
 
  expressed grief at the death and said, "Yesterday (Friday), Vimsar director   said the four injured were out of danger. If Sahu was not critical, why was he shifted to SCB? We urged the governor to order an independent investigation in the matter. We also want the autopsy report to be made public." He also criticized chief minister   Patnaik for 'trying to gain political mileage out of the death.'
 
 Sahu's body was brought to the BJD headquarters here. Naveen, who is also the BJD president, paid tribute to him. 
 
 "The party will look after his family and bear the cost of educating his children," he said. "I am deeply distressed by the tragic demise of Dileswar Sahu," he added.
 
 Sahu is survived by his wife and two children. Three persons have been arrested in connection with the attack.
