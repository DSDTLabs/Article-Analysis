NAGPUR: A special   (MPID) court on Monday awarded seven days police custody remand (PCR) to Prashant  , his wife Bhagyashree, brother Vinay, and brother-in-law Abhijeet Chaudhary.

 The prosecution moved the court regarding second offence lodged at   police station on December 29, 2015. The complainant alleged that she was duped for over Rs1 crore by the accused, who used to run various Ponzi schemes under the umbrella of ‘Wasankar Wealth Management Limited’.
 
 Special public prosecutor Kalpana Pande demanded 15 days PCR to trace their hidden properties, recover the money, and find   purchased by them. The counsel for the accused — Shyam Dewani, Kailash Dodani, Chaitanya Barve and Harshal Puranik — strongly opposed the plea. They contended that the offence was registered 18 months back on allegations similar to first FIR, for which all of them have already been behind bars for three years. They argued that papers of all their properties and even jewellery were seized by the police in the investigation of first offence and nothing was left with them now.
 
 On complaints of builder Vivek Pathak and scores of aggrieved depositors, all four were put behind bars on July 27, 2014. Pegged as one of the biggest such schemes in Maharashtra, the amount involved is believed to be over Rs1,500 crore, with more than 5,000 depositors falling prey to promise of easy money.
 
 The Economic Offences Wing (EoW) sleuths said the accused duped thousands by promising astronomical returns ranging from 24%-75%. Bhagyashree, Vinay’s wife Mithila, Chaudhari’s wife Kumud, and employees — Chandrakant Rai, Deodutt Kardale and   — were also made accused in the FIR.
