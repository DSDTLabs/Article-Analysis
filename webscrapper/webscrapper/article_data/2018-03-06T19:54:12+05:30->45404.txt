SHIMLA: The government will launch a 'no-honking' campaign in   to spread awareness regarding the health hazards from honking by motorists, it was announced on Saturday.

 A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting chaired by Additional Chief Secretary Manisha   in Shimla.
 
 She said it had been felt that unnecessary honking was not only a public nuisance causing inconvenience to the people, but also reflects how sensitive "we are towards our environment and the other living beings".
 
 Nanda said that noise was not merely a nuisance, but also a serious environmental problem and a health hazard.
 
 A lack of awareness about noise pollution caused by honking and its detrimental impact on human health and behaviour was a major concern which needs to be redressed at the earliest, she said.
 
 According to Nanda, a massive information campaign for sensitising drivers, taxi unions, bus and truck drivers, and school students would also be carried effectively.
 
 She said a campaign would be launched in the first phase in Shimla and Manali towns and would cover other urban areas of the state in a phased manner.
