 NDDB has donated a solar photovoltaic (PV) plant to the DCS affiliated with Amul Dairy with a unique system through which the society will not only be able to fulfil its electricity needs but will also be able to earn by selling surplus electricity to the grid. 
 
 NDDB intends to promote this concept to DCSs across the country, said Rath.

 With the support of National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) with whom NDDB has inked an MoU to promote digital payments by dairy cooperatives across the country, Mujkuva villagers have now started receiving payments in the village itself. 
 
 With the support of Amul, NDDB has also started gift milk in the village to fulfil nutritional requirements of school children.
