KOCHI: The first   for agriculture and animal sciences will be inaugurated at SmartCity on Monday.   Agricultural University vice-chancellor   will inaugurate the  . 

 The lab will provide necessary impetus to enhance the quality standards and yield of agriculture and livestock in the country to meet the growing demand for food, address concerns on health and food safety and ensure sustainable development. 
 
 'With the emergence and development of agricultural genomics, next generation sequencing and bioinformatics tools, we are now in the world of whole-genome analysis of plants and animals. As opposed to the study of individual genes, today's technology offers a complete picture of how genes work together. This enable scientists to study, interpret and apply them," said  , chief operating officer, AgriGenome Labs. 
 
 "The DNA sequencing of crops and livestock enables faster improvement through the art of breeding. Looking at the genome, scientists can determine the purity of a breed or hybrid and whether a plant or animal has the desired characteristics rather than conducting enormous trials," said Thomas.
 
 The lab in Kochi will offer a wide range of services including trait mapping, diversity analysis, population genetics, parentage verification, DNA fingerprinting, genetic purity assessment, hybrid purity analysis, mapping of complex traits, marker assisted selection and immunodiagnostics.
