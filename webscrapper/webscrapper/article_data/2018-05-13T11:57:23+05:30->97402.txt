The young bunch of actresses is painting the town red with hatred. The makers of  , a TV series on the lines of Mahanayak, were left fuming when   quit the show after shooting for a few episodes. I hear the actress, who has done films like  ,   and  , decided to concentrate only on films, but realised it rather late. Now Ankita has replaced her in the series. The other actress to have backed out is Darshana Banik. Like Sauraseni, she too perhaps realised that TV is not her calling at an early stage in her career. Now, Anamika will play the part. The thing is, late realisations are always an expensive proposition.
