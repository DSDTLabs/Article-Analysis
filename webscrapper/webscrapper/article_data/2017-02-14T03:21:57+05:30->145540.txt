NOIDA:   can look forward to giving their furry friends a whale of a time this weekend at   Expocentre in Sector 62. The 9th edition of Indian International Pet Trade Fair ( ) comes to Noida on February 17 with the theme, ‘Happy Pets, Happy Owners’.

 With an expected footfall of over 20,000, the three-day event will be packed with information and entertainment. The event features a fashion show for dogs, pet adoption opportunities, aqua-scape workshop, and dog training information.
 
 “Living with a pet is fun, but there are challenges, a day out with the pet is not always possible as most city parks do not allow dogs,” Binoy Sahee, fair director, IIPTF, said.
 
 Pet owners can take notes on pet care training from experts and find out about new food supplements for their pets. 
 
 “Going out with your pet is not easy in cities, so new grooming centres for pets and cafes are coming up at various places so that owners can go and socialise along with their pets. These kinds of service providers will be present at the event. Pet lovers can gain a lot of information,” Sahee added.
