Navi Mumbai: NMMC has got the nod from the state to utilize water from the sewage treatment plant (STP) commercially. The approval from the state-level technical committee came last week and this will enable it to treat grey water for a higher level of purity to be used for industrial processing. 

 This will also save precious drinking water supplied by the MIDC from Barvi dam to the TTC industrial belt.
 
 Being a positive step towards the smart city goal, NMMC had been pursuing the project with the state, which had appointed   as the nodal agency for monitoring the technical details. 
 
 The project, the first of its kind, will be executed at a cost of Rs 130 crore and efforts are on to obtain the funds from the central and state government under the AMRUT scheme. Even as the central government scheme includes a share of funding from local civic bodies, an NMMC official said, “We are trying for 100% funding from the government.” 
 
 The civic body could itself engage in installing the project and recover the cost through commercial sale of treated water.
 
 Municipal commissioner   said, “We will make use of the 40 MLD to 20 MLD water each from the Koparkhairane and Airoli plants for supplying to  . The modalities are being worked out for setting up the plant and supplying the treated water. A technical team has also visited Surat where 40 MLD of treated water is being used.”
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan said, “A technical team led by city engineer Mohan Dagaonkar visited the Surat plant for studying the technology. We are looking at reverse osmosis process for higher grade treatment of  .”
