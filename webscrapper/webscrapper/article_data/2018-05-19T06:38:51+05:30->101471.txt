MUMBAI: Students aspiring to join the   course this year are likely to see an addition of 100 seats in the pool of government seats. The government medical college in Jalgaon may get the nod to start operations.

 
 The   (MCI) has recommended to the   to issue letters of permission to 13 government medical schools across India and four private colleges. Of the 13, five are in Rajasthan, two in Odisha, one in Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh and   each, apart from the one in Jalgaon. With the new college coming through, the pool of seats in the state and corporation colleges will be 2,400.
 
 “We are preparing all our documentation and as soon as we are asked to visit the Centre to present our case, we shall do so,” said Dr  , head of the directorate of medical education and research. “We hope we get the requisite clearances and all our efforts are directed towards starting the new college this year itself.”
 
 The MCI has stated that all new institutes must provide details on infrastructure facilities, teaching and non-teaching staff, building, equipment and hospital. While the state has 16 government-run medical colleges, it was felt that colleges should be established in the Khandesh region (Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and other districts in the northwest parts of the state) and in Sindhudurg district.
 
 Response from the private sector is tepid. A college each will come up in Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and West Bengal. “It is becoming unviable to start and run medical colleges with fees being under the tight control of fee regulatory committees across states,” said a trustee of a private institute.
 
 MCI has also recommended increase in student intake capacity. The Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, will see arise of 10 seats to 150 now.
