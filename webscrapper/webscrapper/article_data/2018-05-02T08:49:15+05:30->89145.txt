LUCKNOW: With   adamant on its decision to not declare BEd results of  , students are running from pillar to post to save their academic year.

 A group of BEd semesters I and III students visited   to request for their results but had to return as the university was closed.
 
 With just a month left for the next semester examination, the students said they were having sleepless nights as they were not able to fill examination forms without results.
 
 “Hearing of the BEd case is scheduled for Wednesday and we are hopeful for a decision in the students’ interest,” said principal Vinita Prakash.
 
 LU had declared the BEd results of all affiliated colleges in April first week. However, results of   semesters I and III were withheld, affecting around 120 students.
 
 “We are visiting the college everyday to find whether the university has sent any direction regarding our result declaration,” said a student of IT College.
 
 She said the group had visited the university last week with the hope of some relief but in vain.
 
 “There is so much confusion with students discussing whether our course will continue or not,” said another BEd student.
 
 Meanwhile, LU authorities said they are bound by rules. “Giving permission to the college to continue with the wrong method of admitting students is not possible. If we declare results, it means we are supporting a wrongdoing. The matter is sub-judice; the college has to wait for the court’s decision,” said LU vice chancellor SP Singh.
