INDORE: The regional pollution control board (PCB) plans to go on an overdrive to catch industries violating effluent discharge norms, so it can meet the deadline of May 15, set by the central  , to submit a report on violations in the region.

 A recent   order made it mandatory for industrial units across the country to set up effluent treatment plants (ETP) and directed the PCB to not allow units to work without the plants.
 
 The order has directed PCB to disconnect water and electricity supply if industries are found flouting rules. According to the board, most of the large industries have ETPs but there is not sufficient data about small industries in the region using ETPs.
 
 A senior PCB official said, “We have started a drive to check water discharge and water treatment mechanisms in every industry of the region. It is mandatory for industries to install ETPs on their premises to treat waste water.”
 
 Industries under any category that discharge waste water must have ETPs installed and every drop of waste water from industrial operations must be treated.
 
 PCB will issue notices to industries found violating mandatory water treatment norms and their work will be suspended too. 
 
 Dinesh Mishra, an executive at a packaging industry operating out of SEZ said, “We follow a zero discharge norm and have set up an ETP worth Rs 1.5 crore on the premises. Whatever water is used in our plant is treated and used in gardens and washrooms.”
 
 Industry participants said most small industries cannot afford to set up ETPs due to the high cost.
 
 There are two common ETPs set up at Sanwer road industrial area and Special Economic Zone.
 
 OP Dhoot, president, Association of Industries   (AIMP) said, “Every industry cannot afford to set up ETP on their premises. Also, the discharge from small industries is very less in comparison to large units. For small industries, more common ETP’s should be made.”
