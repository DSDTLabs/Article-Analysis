NAGPUR:   Home Care Medicine (IHCM) will arrange free home visits, conduct   and give   to 101 women above 60 years of age to coincide with  , on Monday. 

 Brainchild of consultant geriatrician and founder of IHCM Sanjay Bajaj, the initiative is aimed at honouring the spirit of motherhood. The organization has plans to continue the drive every year. 
 
 Dr Bajaj said, “Physicians will visit homes, examine patients and give medical advise to 101 women above 60 years of age who have not consulted IHCM before. The tests include ECG, random blood sugar, blood pressure, and measurement of height and weight. Tips will be given on prevention of osteoporosis, falls, fractures and sarcopenia.” IHCM has a team of twenty members consisting of doctors, nurses and drivers. Physicians will visit two to three old women daily who have enrolled themselves for this service within corporation limits of Nagpur, Pune and Kolhapur, Dr Bajaj said.
 
 Commenting on this new trend, Dr Bajaj said, “In the modern era when food and shopping items arrive at your doorstep soon after you place an order, then why not doctors?” 
 
 According to him, people turn a blind eye towards the well-being of senior citizens. Even seniors themselves neglect their health. In most of the cases, various diseases are detected after the age of 60, but there is a general lack of awareness. IHCM initiative will help such people, he added.
 
 Dr Bajaj said that majority of people do not get proper guidance about nutrition. In many cases, there is no one to look after senior citizens and give them medical attention they require during this phase of life. 
 
 IHCM holds health drives for elder persons during June and October, which coincide with World Father’s Day and International Day of Older Persons respectively.
