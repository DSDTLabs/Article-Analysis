BHUBANESWAR: The   may have granted bail to gangster Sandeep alias   after he was sentenced to life for killing judo coach  . But his worries seem far from over. He is unlikely to be released from jail as his bail in an old case was rejected on Wednesday. 

 Police said a court trial against Acharya in connection with a 2010 case registered against him at Lingaraj police station is still on. "Unless he gets bail in the case, he cannot be released from jail," DCP Satyabrata Bhoi told TOI. Lingaraj police had registered the case against Acharya for allegedly making a threat call from the jail to an automobile showroom dealer for extortion money. Bhoi said at least 40 criminal cases were registered against 48-year-old Acharya at different police stations in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack since 2000. "We have information that he has been acquitted in 20 cases. Though trials are still continuing in 20 other cases, he managed to get bail in 19 of those," Bhoi said. 
 
 The history-sheeter was convicted in the Biranchi Das murder case in December 2010 and has since been cooling his heels in the Jharpada special jail here. He was awarded a four-year jail term by a trial court here in October 2011 for abducting Arun Mantri, brother of Ollywood actress Bidusmita, in April 2008. Acharya was also sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment by a trial court here in March 2012 for sending threat SMS to album actress Leslie Tripathy, whom he unsuccessfully tried to woo in 2008. However, the convictions ran concurrently with his life imprisonment. It was alleged that Acharya had gunned down Biranchi Das, who nurtured child marathoner  , outside the latter's judo centre near Kalpana on April 13, 2008 because the coach tried to shield Leslie get rid of the don.
 
 Incidentally, Acharya was acquitted in June 2010 for issuing death threat to Leslie in a separate case. He was also exonerated in September 2010 a case involving giving death threat to a model coordinator.
