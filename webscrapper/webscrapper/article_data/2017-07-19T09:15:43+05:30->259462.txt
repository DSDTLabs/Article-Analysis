VADODARA: The residents of the   in   will soon get respite from the   buried there. Since a decade, the   (VMC) has been burying small animals there.

 The civic body had an incinerator to dispose animals carcasses. The incinerator malfunctioned in 2006 and could not be repaired. Since then, the civic body has been burying dead animals at Gajrawadi. The repeated digging at the same place to bury animals leads to stench that spreads in the entire locality. Also, remains of carcasses come out at the sites at times.
 
 The VMC had been getting repeated complaints from residents regarding the stench. VMC corporators have also been raising the issue from time to time including representations in the general board.
 
 The corporation is now looking to set up a new incinerator at the site. The incinerator will be procured from a city-based company at a cost of Rs 24.75lakh. But half of the cost of the incinerator will be borne by a spiritual organisation Shri Jalaram Sevashram Trust. The trust has already written a letter to the civic body expressing its interest in the project. 
 
 The civic body is also open to other organisations contributing to the project. A nod has been sought from the standing committee of the civic body to allow the administration to procure the equipment without following processes like tendering. The proposal will be taken up for discussion in the meeting of the committee on Thursday.
