LUDHIANA: Eyeing revenue generation, civic officials in the city are planning to put some of its prime lands up for sale.

 The properties will be used for construction of   (SCOs), sources revealed.
 
 The officials claimed that some of these prime land parcels are available for commercial use. However, these are lying vacant at the moment and can be encroached upon. Moreover, the MC can use the same to generate revenue for the civic body.
 
 Meanwhile, assistant town planner SS   said, “We are preparing the proposal which will be discussed with the municipal commissioner and the mayor. Once their approval is received, the MC general house will take the final call on the matter.”
 
 The officials are considering the sites near   canal, Hambran Road, Kailash Cinema road and Jawaddi for the auction, sources revealed. At first, the officials will visit these sites and complete the demarcation of land. In case any encroachments are found on the said sites, the same will be removed.
 
 Earlier, the civic officials had tried selling some prime properties but could not garner enough response from the drive. The SCOs to be constructed opposite Keys Hotel are still under dispute and only a few have been constructed so far. The dispute arose out of payment of pending dues. As a result, some of the allottees did not construct the SCOs, even as the auction of the land took place in 2013.
