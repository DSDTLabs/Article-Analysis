JAIPUR: Is Mughal emperor Akbar really the Great? The country and scholars must have debated this question for centuries, but it again came to the fore at   ( ) on Sunday.

 Author Shazi Zaman’s book ‘Akbar’, said to be the outcome of 20 years of research and studying historical documents from museums in India and abroad, presents some unheard of accounts from the life and times of the Mughal emperor.
 
 Speaking to senior journalist Ravish Kumar at the session, ‘Akbar: Kitna Itihas, Kitna Upanyas’, held in Charbagh, the author highlighted the secular aspect of Akbar.
 
 Claiming that Akbar was a true secular emperor, the author pointed to the book’s cover which showed his shield with pictures of 12 Hindu rishis along with the picture of sun.
 
 The book further claims that Akbar prayed to the Sun. Quoting a para from the book, Zaman said that once during a fit of anger Akbar said that Muslims should eat the meat of pig and Hindus that of cow. He explained that this controversial statement was made when he was upset over the Hindu-Muslim tension.
 
 When Kumar asked the author if the book was a work of history, literature or fiction, Zaman said that it was a product of meticulous research carried out to the core of Akbar’s life, and stated that he had studied historical texts such as ‘Akbarnama’, ‘Muntkhbutwaarikh', ‘Babarnama’, ‘Humayunnama’ and 'Tazikratul Wakyaat’ as well as paintings, monuments and buildings from that era.
