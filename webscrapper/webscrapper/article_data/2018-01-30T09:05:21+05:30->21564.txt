SURAT: If you aspire to be a financial wizard but lack the wherewithal and proper guidance to make it, don’t lose hope.   (34), a chartered accountant (CA), company secretary (CS) and cost and management accountant (CMA), has made it his life’s ambition to help deserving students. 

 For the past 14 years, he has been running coaching classes for professional courses in the city. His life took on new meaning and a different direction when he launched   in 2016 and enrolled 38 students in his class and provided them free education for chartered accountancy course conducted by The  . Fourteen of them were provided free boarding and lodging facilities too as they belonged to another city and could not afford to pay for the expenses. Of the total 38 beneficiary students, 27 have cleared the   (IPCC) examination and are now eligible to appear for CA final examination. 
 
 “I have been providing free coaching to students but not at this scale. I felt many deserving students needed support. Hence, I increased the number of beneficiaries by enrolling 38 students for CA course,” said Chhavchharia, who was among national toppers in CA, CS and CMA examinations. 
 
 “Gradually, students from outside too have started to come. So, I arranged for their stay and food in apartments near my institute. A few students helped by my coaching institute are now working at good places,” he added.
 
 “My father had passed away a few years ago and I had no money for tuition for CA course. I approached sir and he agreed to coach me without taking any fees from me,” said Urvashi Pandya, whose mother runs tiffin service to meet the household expenses.
 
 Chhavchharia usually charges Rs45,000 for CA final examination and Rs34,000 for CA-IPCC examination.
