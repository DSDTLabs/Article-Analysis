HYDERABAD: Popular   and   leader   has come out in support of Jallikattu. His response also brings out a North-South divide as he refers to the people of ‘Dakshin Bharat’ being hurt at the ban on Jallikattu and also Kodipandem (cock fights).

 Early on Friday, the actor posted photographs of himself in his farmhouse near Hyderabad showing that he had 16 cows and calves in his ‘goshala’. 
 
 “Looking at the roosters and cows in my farm made by think about the ban on Jallikattu and Kodipandem in Dakshin Bharat,” the actor said.
 
 “The ban on Jallikattu and Kodipandem by the Government of India is an attack on Dravidian culture and its integrity. This is how it is being viewed in Dakshin Bharat. I observed this deep hurt in the people of Dakshin Bharat while I was shooting in Pollachi, Tamil Nadu,” he said.
 
 The actor-politician said during his political interactions in Andhra he came to know about the feelings of people about the ban of their respective cultural events in recent times. “The government of India cited animal cruelty as the reason for the ban on Jallikattu and Kodipandem. If we truly consider this puritanical approach ,then we have to examine the statistics of India beef exports and poultry industry,” he said.
