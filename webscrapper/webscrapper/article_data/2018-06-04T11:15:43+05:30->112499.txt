CHANDIGARH: The 14 sub-committees for the Chandigarh municipal corporation will start functioning from next week. Since, these   carry financial powers too, all the small tasks related to developmental works will be assigned to these committees instead of finance and contract committee (F&CC) or the general house.

 The role of some of these committees is quite crucial, as they carry good amount of finance. Mostly, the issues related to their subject are directly sent to them from the general house and F&CC for thorough probe. F&CC had hence been facing a lot of pressure in absence of these committees. They have now been constituted after a gap of five months.
 
 They include road committee, water supply and sewerage disposal committee, house tax assessment committee, sanitation committee, environment and city beautification committee, electricity committee, fire and emergency services committee, apni mandi and day market committee, women empowerment committee, enforcement committee, slum, colonies and village development committee, arts, culture and sports committee, primary health committee and primary education committee. Each of them have nine members, which will hold their meetings and discuss the agenda items. Each committee will hold one meeting in a month to discuss the issues of their subject.
