LUCKNOW: Within days of RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya triggering a controversy by saying that caste-based quotas are not supposed to be permanent, Sangh's joint general secretary   on Monday hailed Dalit icon Babasaheb Ambedkar as a 'patriot' who was not opposed to Vedic religion and didn't represent any caste.

 Krishna Gopal was speaking at a lecture series on Ambedkar organised at   (BBAU) in Lucknow.
 
 “In fact, he had immense faith in Vedic religion but was opposed to the discrepancies that occurred later. A champion of the downtrodden, it was Ambedkar who opposed the idea of language-based states," Krishna Gopal said.
 
 “Ambedkar never spoke against the country even though he had to face insults and worked to ensure unity without malice. Itne atyachaar aur apmaan ke baad bhi, unhone kisi ko bura nahi kaha, aur zeher, bhagwan Shiva ki tarah, apne gale me hi rakha (Despite facing insults and atrocities, Ambedkar didn't utter anything wrong to anyone. He, like Lord Shiva, drank poison and did not let anyone get affected),“ he added. The RSS leader said great personalities like Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar had the same ideology .“They may differ from each other on a few issues but both worked for a common goal for the betterment of the country ,“ he said. Krishna Gopal said Ambedkar was never against religion. “He could not envisage a society without religion.According to him, religion was a central point. But he did not believe in only rituals, but rather the spiritual part of it, which was evident in the Vedas...,“ he said, claiming that Ambedkar was never against Brahmins.
