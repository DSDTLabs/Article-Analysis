MUMBAI: Observing that pendency of a criminal case and change in management will not change its liability, a   has ordered Dhanalaxmi Co-operative   to hand over Rs 1.38 lakh deposited by an   in 2008. The society will also have to pay around Rs 1.49 lakh in  . The EOW has registered a complaint against the credit society chairman and attached it properties. 

 The court refuted the administrator’s plea to transfer the complaint to the sessions court. The complaint was filed before the Additional Mumbai Suburban District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on January 25, 2011, by Khar resident Nilesh Hate, who said in 2008, he opened two accounts with the credit society—one in his mother’s name and another in his son’s name. Hate told the forum that he shut the accounts in 2009, but the society did not return the Rs 1.38 lakh balance, which was in his son’s account. Hate said he even lodged a complaint with the EOW. 
 
 In his reply to the forum, the credit society chairman denied all allegations and said the management was done by other officers. 
 
 The forum perused the Hate documents and said, “We are of the view that the society is liable to pay the amount to account-holder with reasonable interest. The pendency of criminal case and change in management will not change the liability of society.” 
 
 The consumer forum added that considering the poor financial condition of the society, it was taking a lenient view and did not direct it to pay compensation.
