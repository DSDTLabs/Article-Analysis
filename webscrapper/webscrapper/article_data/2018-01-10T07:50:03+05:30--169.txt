BHUBANESWAR: The   on Tuesday increased the   by 30% to 40% and brought their   on a par with their counterparts who are staffers. 

 The move is part of the government's initiative to attract and retain faculty members in the two newly opened medical colleges in Baripada and Koraput and three upcoming medical colleges in Balangir, Balasore and Puri.
 
 "Contractual professors, who have been drawing a salary of Rs 90,000 per month, will now get Rs 1.25 lakh per month," health minister Pratap Jena said.
 
 Similarly, associate professors will draw Rs 1 lakh compared to Rs 75,000 per month earlier. The assistant professors will get Rs 75,000, up from Rs 60,000. 
 
 "The government will also offer annual hike of three per cent to these teachers," the minister said.
 
 Though the number of contractual teachers is less than 50 at present, the government plans to make more contractual appointments for the medical colleges. The government is planning to recruit around 40 more medical teachers soon, a government official said. "Since the regular appointment process takes time, it will be difficult to fill up the posts and meet the   norms unless contractual teachers are hired," the official added.
 
 The revised salary is over and above the location-based incentives the medical teachers get. For example, faculty members in   region get 100% extra as location incentive considering the region is remote, poorly connected and lack social infrastructure. So, professors in Balangir and Koraput medical colleges will draw Rs 2.5 lakh per month, the official added.
 
 It must be mentioned that the government had earlier announced a hike in the monthly stipend for interns of government-run medical colleges in the state by Rs 5000 per month with retrospective effect from April 1, 2017. They now get Rs 20,000 per month compared to Rs 15,000 earlier.
