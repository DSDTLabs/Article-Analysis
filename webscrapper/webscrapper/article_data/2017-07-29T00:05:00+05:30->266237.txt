With a Bachelors degree in Pharmacy and over 30 years of experience in  , Goa-based musician and   William D’Souza, who was in the city recently, says that he is always on the lookout for new sounds and rhythms.

 Question him on why he creates awareness on using daily objects to produce music, and he says, “I believe that the trends could change tomorrow and hence my intention is to creatively use everyday objects. I believe that in the future, space could always be an issue. People should find objects that require less space and can still produce good sound.” 
 
 William usually creates melody using utensils with a copper base, sweet bottle jars, car horn, benches and more. “The old-style car horn is very useful to create Latin rhythmic beats,” he says. William’s fascination with music began as early as when he was 10-years-old. “My father was a violinist and my mother was a dancer, so music came to me naturally. After I finished my education, I was called by a group named Embryo, who took me to Germany and that was a life changing experience for me. However, I came back to Bengaluru and enrolled in Karnataka College of Percussion, so my music has a lot of Carnatic and Western influence,” he says. 
 
 A well-known name in Goa, William has even worked with   and other international bands who have toured the country. “Back in the day, I was one of the only percussionists from Goa and that opened a lot of avenues for me, including some impromptu acts with Remo Fernandes’ band,” adds William.
 
 When asked about his future plans, William says, “I want to continue my research on music. I want to create and find more melody and rhythm, and want to share this knowledge with others. My message to budding musicians is ‘have the right attitude, the right approach, perseverance and focus’,” he signs off.
