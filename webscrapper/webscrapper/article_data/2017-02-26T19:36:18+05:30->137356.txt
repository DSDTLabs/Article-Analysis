Hindustani classical singer  , who made his playback-singing debut with the recent   film  , has just introduced his first independent music video, Kaahe Tu. Written, composed and sung by the Mangaluru-born vocalist, who represents the Kirana Gharana, the video is shot extensively at various, little-known locations in and around  . Directed by Jayanth Aithal, the video features Bharatanatyam dancer and dietician Sridevi Bhat, who is also acting in a music video for the first time. 

 'It started off as an experimental project in February last year. I always to wanted to do a music video of my own, and this sounded like a good opportunity. I chose to sing in Hindi so that it reaches out to more people even outside the state. I am planning to compose for similar albums in Kannada as well. Apart from the music, the specialty of the music video is that it features some beautiful locations in Udupi ' particularly a heritage house and hanging bridge. The video follows a storyline and is full of classical expressions,' says Balachandra. 
 
 The singer, whose formal musical training took place in   and who completed his MBA in  , is releasing two more music videos later this month ' one on morning raga and the other on Shiva shlokas.
