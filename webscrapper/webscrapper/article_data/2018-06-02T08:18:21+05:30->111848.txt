LUCKNOW: A day after the defeat in Kairana and Noorpur by-elections, the ruling   in Uttar Pradesh faced yet another embarrassment on Friday when party MLA   from   constituency in   took to social media and termed government officials as "corrupt" and chief minister Yogi Adityanath "helpless". 

 In a   post, he wrote a poem saying BJP came to power in the name of PM  , but couldn't do much for the people. " Modi naam se pa gaye raaj... kar na sake janta mann kaaj... Sangh, Sangathan haath lagam... Mukhyamantri bhi asahay... janta aur Vidhayak trast, adhikari adhyaksh bhrasht (Government was formed in the name of PM Modi... but could not work as per the expectation of the people... it is neither Sangh, nor CM Yogi who is wielding power... people and MLAs are frustrated and officials are corrupt)," Prakash wrote.
