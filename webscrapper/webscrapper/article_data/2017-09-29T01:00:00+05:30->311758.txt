Dressed in traditional Assamese mekhla chador, members of   (NADA) in Sector 119, made the most of the Durga Puja celebration. Since the pandal was set up by the Assamese community of Noida, Goddess Durga was seen wearing a mekhla chador too, with a traditional golpata (neckpiece). The pandal was covered with white cloth that signifies that the idol must be covered to prevent the rays of the moon from reaching her. "We believe that Durga is the mother goddess and the moon is a demigod, so it is not above the goddess. This is the first time that we are organizing this Puja in the Assamese way and the response has been really nice," says Biman Chandra Borthakur, president of the association.

  "With japi, gamcha and other such items, we have decorated the pandal in typical Assamese style. We performed 60% of the rituals in typical Bengali way and 40% in traditional Assamese way. We have the big Assamese cymbals that we play during the puja. We believe that Maa Durga is our daughter and she comes back home from the Himalayas for these five days," says Ritupan Kaushik, one of the Puja in-charges.
