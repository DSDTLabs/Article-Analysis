PUNE: One out of the two laptops, used for entering patients’ records, was stolen from the fourth floor of a private hospital in   on Friday afternoon.

 Prasad Wahal, a hospital employee, lodged a complaint the with   police.   told TOI the hospital had kept two laptops in the fourth-floor passage for the doctors’ and nurses’ convenience. “The doctors and nurses entered their records in the laptops,” he said.
 
 He said both the laptops have passwords so that nobody else could access them. Moreover, the laptops were locked in a case so that no one could steal them either. 
 
 “However, on Friday, someone broke one of the two cases and made away with the laptop worth Rs 30,000,” Wavhal said adding that the suspect tried breaking the other case as well, but did not succeed in the attempt.
 
 An officer from the Alankar police station said they are checking the hospital’s   footage to trace the suspect. “We are surprised how someone could steal the laptop when there are security personnel on each floor of the hospital and its entrance,” the officer said,
