GURUGRAM: A group of   residents, unable to bear with   drains and broken roads, knocked on the door of   on Monday, in a desperate attempt to jolt the lax civic officials into action.

 The residents alleged that they had been suffering due to the clogged drains for the past three-four months. And the recent showers, which resulted in flooding of the sector roads, have only added to their woes. They submitted a memorandum to the commissioner, requesting him to look into the matter and address the problem on a priority basis.
 
 “Almost 70% of the drains are clogged here. Dirty water flows on the roads regularly, causing problems for the  ,” said Dharmendra Singh, president, RWA.
 
 The residents blamed   for lack of maintenance and cleaning of the sewerage lines. “The drains were last cleaned up in 2014. We had made several requests to MCG officials in the past, but in vain,” said Vinod Vashisth, a resident.
 
 “During the showers, the sectors roads get flooded easily as the clogged sewage lines are unable to   out the rainwater. We are living in an unhealthy condition. The dirty water, accumulated on the surface, has become a breeding place for germs and mosquitoes,” said Shammi Ahlawat, chairperson, RWA.
 
 The residents also highlighted the issue of the broken roads in the area. Sources said the road repair work, which was started a few months ago, has been put on hold due to the monsoon.
