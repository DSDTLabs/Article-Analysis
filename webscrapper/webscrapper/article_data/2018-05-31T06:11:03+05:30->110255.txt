CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain   on Wednesday directed chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh to prepare a “comprehensive” river-cleaning plan and set a timeline for its implementation. 

 He said rivers passing through the state — Ravi, Beas and Satluj — had to be cleaned up just like the central government’s projects to clean up the Ganga and the  . The state government has already submitted a proposal in this regard to the central government, he added.
 
 Chairing a review meeting in the wake of the recent molasses spill in the Beas, after a leak in a sugar mill in Gurdaspur district on May 17, the chief minister directed the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to monitor all industrial units and act against those found discharging untreated industrial waste into rivers. 
 
 He emphasized on keeping a strict vigil on untreated industrial effluents which flow into the   in Ludhiana, and Kala Sanghian drain passing through Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar. Local government minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, environment minister OP Soni and revenue minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria attended the meeting.
 
 The chief minister said none of the 64 water and sewage treatment plants in the state was functional when the   came to power last year. “The number of functional units has gone up to 18 now. By the end of the year, 40 of these plants would become operational,” said Amarinder.
 
 Describing the recent Beas river pollution as an accident resulting from record production of cane this sugar season, Amarinder said the central government was also expected to ensure that the right amount of cane was produced and sold to the mills for sugar production. He attacked Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition   for “indulging in cheap politics” over such a serious issue. “AAP leaders like Khaira are only interested in getting their pictures printed in newspapers through cheap publicity tactics,” he said.
