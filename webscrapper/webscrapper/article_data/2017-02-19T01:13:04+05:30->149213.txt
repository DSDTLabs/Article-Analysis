GURUGRAM: Two days after TOI reported about the   to 70 streetlights in   getting snapped over   to  , the   (MCG) on Saturday resolved the issue.

 Lack of streetlights led to a spike in the crime in the area, according to the residents.
 
 However, an MCG official claimed that there were no dues on the civic agency’s part. “We got to know about dysfunctional streetlights in the sector last Friday. There were no dues. It was merely some confusion that led to disconnection of power to streetlights. After residents made a request and a media report was carried on Thursday, we fixed the lights on that day itself,” said the MCG official, who did not wish to be named.
 
 Residents were relieved to realise the issue was fixed after these streetlights went out last week (February 8). 
 
 “I am glad that the streetlights were fixed after the matter was reported. We were extremely worried as lack of streetlights triggered rise in cases of eve-teasing in the area. We hope that the corporation keeps a regular check over maintenance and upkeep of streetlights as it is the basic requirement of residents living in any area,” said Harsh, a member of Sector 28 RWA.
 
 Sangeeta Raina, a resident, said, “Absence of streetlights lead to maximum number of crimes, especially abduction, eve-teasing and other crimes against women. Also road accidents can increase as roads are already in very bad shape. It was good to see prompt action by the corporation this time though.”Developed by Huda, the sector has more than 200 streetlights.
