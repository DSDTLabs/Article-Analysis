NEW DELHI:  , adviser to   Prime Minister on foreign affairs, defened the military court's verdict against  , and said the government had concrete evidence against him.

 Questioning why Jadhav had two passports, Aziz said India must provide an explanation for this.
 
 "I would like to ask India why he (Jadhav) was using a fake identity and masquerading as a Muslim. Why would an innocent person possess two passports, one with a Hindu name and the other bearing a Muslim name? For this, India has no answer," the Dawn quoted Aziz as saying.
 
 Further, Aziz claimed that every norm and regulation had been followed during the proceedings of Jadhav's trial.
 
 "He (Jadhav) was involved in subversive activities in Pakistan. He was sentenced as per the law of the land. He has the right to file a review in the   and also file a mercy petition to the army chief and the President in 40 days," the top diplomat told reporters at a press briefing..
 
 Aziz also claimed that the reason India was denied consular access to Jadhav was becuase it had refused to cooperate on diplomatic matters involving Pakistani spies held in custody.
 
 Dismissing India's assertion that Jadhav, a former naval officer, was captured in Iran, Aziz insisted that Jadhav is a serving naval official. He further warned India to stop issuing "rhetorical statements" against   over the issue.
 
 "Inflammatory statements and rhetoric of premeditated murder will only result in escalation, serving no useful purpose," Aziz warned, in an apparent reference to external affairs minister  's address in the   earlier this week.
 
 Swaraj had condemned Jadhav's trial as "farcical" and the death penalty against him as an act of "premeditated murder" by Pakistan. Warning Pakistan to consider the "consequences" on their ties if Kulbhushan Jadhav is hanged in the alleged espionage case, Swaraj vowed to go "out of the way" to save him.
