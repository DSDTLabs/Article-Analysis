AHMEDABAD: A consumer court directed a builder to create a parking facility for 50 cars and 25 two-wheelers at a residential complex in Surat. The developer,  , has been told to provide the facility seven years after he completed the housing scheme and flat owners started living there.

 The case involves  , developed on a 4,727 square metre plot in the Vesu area of Surat. Twenty-three of the 78 flat owners moved the Surat District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum with complaints that the developers had not provided facilities as promised in a brochure and as stated in the agreement.
 
 Last July, the consumer court in Surat ordered the builders to provide common facilities like gym, indoor games facilities including basketball and badminton courts within two years. The forum, however, did not address their grievance regarding parking facilities.
 
 The residents were unsatisfied with the forumâ€™s order as they wanted more parking space because the builder had promised that each flat owner would have parking space for one car and two scooters. However, in place of parking space for 78 cars and 156 two-wheelers, space was provided only for 28 cars and 131 two-wheelers. The flat owners then approached the   State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.
 
 The residents submitted that a third building in the scheme, which they unsuccessfully objected to, had led to the shortage of parking space. 
 
 The builder argued that the third tower was erected after getting permission from the civic body, which had assessed the parking facilities while granting Building Use permission.
 
 After hearing the case, the consumer commission ordered the developer to create parking space for 50 cars and 25 two-wheelers for residents because this was what was promised to them seven years ago and they had bought houses in the scheme on the basis of the promises made.
