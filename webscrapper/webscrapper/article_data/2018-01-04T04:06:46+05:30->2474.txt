NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation has directed its department to ensure all   complexes are functional for 24 hours during the House meeting on Wednesday keeping into consideration a similar move by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). Currently, the toilet complexes under SDMC operate in two shifts — from 7am to 2pm and 2pm to 10pm. 

 “To ensure that people use the toilet and put an end to   defecation, we have directed the department to ensure all   are functional for 24 hours and attendants are deployed for its maintenance,” said Shikha Rai, leader of House SDMC. 
 
 In October 2017,   had declared all its 104 wards “open defecation free”, however, the problem still exists, especially rural and slum areas under the civic body’s jurisdiction. 
 
 Last year, SDMC had constructed 32 of the sanctioned 348 community toilet complexes and 97 of 440 public toilets. DUSIB constructed over 60 toilet complexes with over 2,000 seats in 2017 and developed 617 toilet complexes, 23 cubicle toilets and deployed 36 mobile toilets in its areas. TNN
