MANALI: Peak winter season is almost over and Manali received its first spell of snow this year only on Tuesday. It has led to concern among the elderly and made them turn to their deities for rain and snow. They blame internet and handy weather forecast for this and believe that it is the result of technology being given more importance than deities that weather god is upset and not showering snow and rain.

 Nitin Sharma, priest of Shirghan Nag, a deity who is believed to control rain and snow, said a large number of people had come for relief after they were directed here by the oracles. “The deity said people are abandoning the holy cow on roadsides and ‘dharma karma’ has no place in the society. Mother nature is upset with the mankind and that it is resulting in dry conditions,” he said.
 
 The century-old tradition of taking shelter of deities after dry spells is close to extinction in Kullu. All temples in   used to organize puja and special events to appease the deities. The locals even used to throng temples to ask for possibility of snowfall and weather forecast. Today, this has been replaced by internet.
 
 “The deities are probably angry with us. We are bringing deities to the roads. The sacred dance forms ‘Laldi’ and ‘Orn’ are being organized on road during   and winter carnival of Manali. These holy dance forms can be performed on special occasions only. Cattle are left to die on the roadside. Nothing good is happening,” said  , an elderly from Manali.
 
 Another elderly   said deities used to forecast weather till a few years back, exactly like internet does now. But nobody is asking them anymore. “Our tradition has almost become extinct. Even our priests now mobile phones to see weather forecast. We remember deities only when we are in real trouble after long dry spells.”
