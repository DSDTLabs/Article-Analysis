PATNA:   leaders led by leader of opposition   protested outside the state assembly and took out a march up to the   on Monday in protest against the delay in arrest of BJP leader Manoj   whose SUV allegedly crushed at least 20 schoolchidlren, killing nine of them on the spot, in Muzaffarpur.

 Tejashwi warned of a public agitation if the culprit was not arrested immediately.
 
 Interacting with media before taking out the march, Tejashwi accused chief minister Nitish Kumar and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi of protecting Baitha.
 
 “More than 48 hours have passed, but the administration has failed to arrest the culprit,” Tejashwi said and, added SuMo was helping Baitha evade arrest. He also flayed the CM and deputy CM for not visiting the bereaved families.
 
 Tejashwi also submitted a memorandum to governor Satya Pal Malik, highlighting poor law and order situation and state- sponsored atrocities on the marginalised sections.
 
 The memorandum also talked about various scams, including Srijan and toilet scams, and land grabbing by BJP leaders. 
 
 However, NDA leaders criticised Tejashwi for politicising the issue as BJP MLC Sanjay Mayukh said deaths should not be used for deriving political mileage.
 
 JD (U) spokesperson   called Tejashwi a ‘newborn child’ in politics. “He is giving irresponsible statement. We have a track record of good governance, and the culprit will be behind bars,” he said.
