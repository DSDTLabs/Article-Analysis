BHADRAK: Science Express Climate Action Special, an innovative mobile science exhibition train, reached Bhadrak on Tuesday but the response from the people was poor on the first day of its halt near the riot-hit town. The train will halt here for four days from May 9 to 12. 

 On the first day, about 400 people, including students and children, thronged the science express exhibition. Official sources said when the train had reached Chandil in   on May 8, the response had been huge. Nearly 13,381 people had visited the exhibition. At its earlier halt at   in  , the exhibition had drawn 17,000 visitors. Usually, the footfall is very high for these science exhibitions. Though the train was supposed to stop at Bhadrak at 10 am, it was late by two-and-a-half hours. It halted at a goods shed, around 1 km away. Since the station was 5 km away from the town, this could have been a reason for the poor footfall.
 
 Programme manager   of the exhibition said they had informed the district education officer about the arrival of the train. "We had also informed the public through the media. Schools in Odisha have closed for the summer vacation from April 28. So it was not possible for schools to bring the students to the exhibition," he said. 
 
 Mrunal Majhi, a local, blamed the scorching heat for the poor footfall. "The train is parked on the outskirts of the town. That may have discouraged many," he added.
