MUMBAI: The proposal for converting the   at Shivaji Park in Dadar into the --Bal Thackeray memorial received its final nod from the   on Monday without any kind of discussion.

 The proposal had already received a go ahead from the   on January 11 this year. In fact on the morning of January 11 a few hours before the   could be announced a meeting had been called hurriedly by the civic improvements committee to give the proposal a nod. This is mainly as no major proposal could be passed during the code of conduct.
 
 As per the proposal the Mayor bungalow plot, which is approximately 11,500 sq metres would be handed over to the members for the trust that will be entrusted with the upkeep of the memorial of late party chief Bal Thackeray. A senior civic official said now that the corporation has passed the proposal they would sit along with their legal department to prepare the draft lease deed. “The trust would need to execute the agreement. However for making any kind of change they would need consent of the heritage committee mainly as the bungalow is a listed heritage structure,” said the official. The plot is being handed over to the trust at a rent of Re 1 per annum. In September this year the Shiv Sena has submitted to Maharashtra government the names of the members for the trust. While Sena President Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya would remain as lifetime trustees, Sena leader Subhash Desai and architect Shashi Prabhu had been nominated as members of the Trust.
 
 However there is yet a question over where would the new Mumbai Mayor move in considering the bungalow at Byculla zoo which has been considered would still require certain refurbishment to make it to the caliber of the home for Mumbai’s first citizen.
