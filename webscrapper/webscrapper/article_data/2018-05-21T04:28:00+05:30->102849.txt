Mangaluru: A Facebook live video, purportedly showing a person raising pro-Pakistan slogan during a celebration by Congress supporters in the city, has gone viral.

 The 139-second video has since been deleted. The original video, remastered to highlight the purported slogan, runs for 80 seconds. The person highlighting the mastered video rewinds to the portion where this alleged slogan is heard.
 
 Vijeth Nayak, a Facebook user, referring to the alleged video posted by Samarth Bhat, commented: “Dear why have you deleted your live video which I have commented on,,,,, if nothing is wrong in that video why you have deleted (sic).”
 
 Samarth, in his defence, states that the media was very much present during the celebration and anyone with grievance could cross-check with them. He also posted another video where the offensive part is not heard.
 
 City police chief Vipul Kumar said no complaint has been filed. “This may be one of the fake or doctored messages that are in circulation. We have already warned people from forwarding unverified videos or messages on social media. We have seen the video and are verifying it,” he said.
 
 The reported incident took place when Congress workers, led by former Mangaluru City South MLA  , were celebrating in front of the DKDCC office after the resignation of B S Yeddyurappa as the chief minister.
