 Narmada district superintendent of police Mahendra Bagadiya told TOI, “Sardar Sarovar Dam is an important asset, strategically located between Vindhyas and Satpura ranges with a large catchment area. It is essential that we install CCTV cameras at strategic locations of the dam and also the Statue of Unity. A survey for CCTV surveillance was conducted a few months ago and a proposal submitted to   (SSNL). The SSNL authorities have approved the proposal and sanctioned Rs20 crore for installation of CCTV cameras at 44 locations of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and the statue of Unity at Kevadia Colony.” 
 
 Work for installation of CCTV cameras will start soon and is expected to be completed by September-end. The Statue of Unity is likely to be inaugurated by Prime Minister   on October 31. The CCTV cameras will help Narmada police keep a watch in the interior parts of the dam and on the hilly areas, Bagadiya added.
