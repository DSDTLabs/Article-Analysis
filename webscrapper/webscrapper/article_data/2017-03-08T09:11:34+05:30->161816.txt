NEW DELHI: A 32-year-old man was stabbed to death by a group of men after a scuffle in southeast Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar on Monday post-midnight in a suspected   case. Two others were critically injured in the incident.

 Around 1am, the police received a call about three men bleeding profusely near a park. They were taken to a nearby private hospital. One of them, later identified as Vinod, was declared dead, while the other two are in a critical condition.
 
 Vinod, a taxi driver, got into a scuffle with the accused men after an argument. He then called the cab owner, Mukesh, and his relative, Satya Prakash, to help him. The accused men stabbed the trio and fled.
 
 “No CCTVs have captured the incident,” said a senior officer. The police will question the injured men once they are fit. A case under IPC sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) has been registered. Raids are on to nab a few suspects from Dakshinpuri.
