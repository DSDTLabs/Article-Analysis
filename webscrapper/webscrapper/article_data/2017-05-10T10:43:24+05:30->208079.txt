BENGALURU:  , a former rowdy sheeter who is absconding after Rs 14.8 crore in demonetized currency was seized from his house, has released a second video.

 In the video, he alleged that all cases filed against him are a conspiracy by senior police officers in the city.These senior police officers had approached him to convert demonetized currency lying with them, but couldn't do so. To get back at him, they have been filing cases against him, he said.
 
 Since his last video, several cases were filed against   by many officers, who he alleged are part of a senior IPS officer's conspiracy to trap him. In an appeal to chief minister Siddaramaiah, Naga claimed that he is contemplating do ing something drastic in front of  , and if he did, the CM would be responsible for it.
 
 He asked the chief minister to order a probe against his senior police officers. He added that a study of call records would reveal which police officer had called him, and how many times.
 
 However, Naga lavished praise on home minister   as he had said action would be taken against the guilty , irrespec tive of whether they were IPS or IAS officers. “If the home minister asks me, I will present myself before him in 10 minutes,“ Naga said.
 
 Plea to senior cop
 
 Ironically, he even made a plea to the senior IPS officer to stop the witch-hunt. “You have got back the money you had given me,“ he said.
 
 He went on to add that though there were around 40 cases registered against him, most of them were petty in nature. Many of them were registered while he was contesting elections, for campaign-related offences.
 
 The only attempt to murder case filed against him (as per his claim) was a false one, he said, adding that most of the cases involved a penalty in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 200 as fine.
