CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered notice to the Puducherry government on a PIL moved by legislator   seeking direction to the government to desist from the proposal for expansion of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Kalapet. 

 A division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and   passed the interim order directing the authorities, including the Puducherry pollution control board to file their replies by June 8.
 
 The petitioner said Strides Shasun Limited in Kalapet has been classified as 'red category large industry' by the CPCB. 
 
 "Though there are complaints that the company is causing serious pollution in the area and exploiting the ground water, it had illegally expanded its operation in the area despite a ban imposed by the government.
 
 "As a representative of the area I raised the issue in the assembly. The company has applied to the Union ministry of environment for clearance for further expansion," the petitioner said. 
 
 Aggrieved by the move, the petitioner has approached the high court.
