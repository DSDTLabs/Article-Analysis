KOLKATA: Not a single Durga idol from any community Durga Puja committee in the city was immersed on Ekadashi, despite a High Court order that had revoked the   government’s ban on immersion of Durga idols as it had coincided with   on Sunday.

 “None of the community pujas had immersed their idols in the Hooghly on Sunday. A handful of household puja idols were immersed on Sunday morning and afternoon but the number is very few,” said Supratim Sarkar, joint commissioner (headquarter) of Kolkata Police.
 
 Sources said, eight idols were immersed at Nimtala Ghat, three at Judges Ghat and only one idol was immersed at Baje Kadamtala Ghat (Babughat) from Sunday morning till afternoon. “All of them were household puja idols that had not brought any procession with them. However, a few small budget community puja idols in Jadavpur, Bijoygarh and   areas immersed their idols in the local ponds but again without any major procession on Sunday morning,” said an officer at the police traffic control room.
 
 “We generally immerse our idol on Ekadashi but this time, since the government had issued a ban, we had already made alternative arrangement and decided to be a part of the immersion carnival. When High Court revoked the order we decided not to change the schedule anymore,” said a senior club organizer. All other big ticket puja committees also refrained from immersing their idols on Ekadashi, when the city witnessed more than 50 Muharram procession across different parts of the city.
