Ludhiana: Two motorcycle-borne miscreants tricked a hosiery trader and looted him of Rs 9 lakh on RK Road in broad daylight on Wednesday. The trader was going to his factory from his house with a cash bag and a laptop in the backseat of the car, which his driver was driving.

 Sixty-year-old Shiv Kumar Bansal of Barewal Road owns a hosiery factory in Phase-IV of Focal Point. Following his daily routine, he left in the morning with his driver Kuljinder Singh. Around 11am, when they reached RK Road near Cheema Chowk, two men on a bike waved to the driver and said fuel was leaking from the engine. 
 
 The driver stopped and started checking the car. The trader followed him out. Meanwhile, the miscreants picked up the cash bag and laptop, and fled. 
 
 ACP (center) Mandeep Singh and Division 6 police personnel reached the spot. Mandeep Singh said Bansal often carried Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh with him to the factory. However, on Wednesday he had Rs 9 lakh in his bag. Division 6 SHO inspector Davinder Singh said the bike rider was wearing a helmet, and the face of the pillion rider captured in nearby CCTV cameras was unclear. 
 
 The police have sounded alert at all checkpoints. They are also investigating the role of the driver who was hired 25 days ago. The cops said it seemed to be the handiwork of a person who knew that the trader had more cash on Wednesday. 
 
 An FIR under section of 379-B (snatching) of the IPC has been registered against unidentified accused.
