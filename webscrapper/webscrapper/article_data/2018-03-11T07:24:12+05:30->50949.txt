LUCKNOW: The city has got its first digital and paperless policecircle office. Ghazipur circle office on Saturday was equipped with the crime and criminal tracking network system (CCTNS).

 Now, in three city police stations—Indiranagar, Gudumba and Ghazipur—officers can see and monitor online the cases being registered and details of the general diary.
 
 
 General diary keeps a record of all personnel in a particular police station. “Under the system, office staff can monitor the current status of investigation of a case. Even the public can see the status of their complaint by clicking on a link online,” said circle officer Ghazipur Avnishwar Srivastava. Indiranagar, Sarvodayanagar, HAL and parts of Mahanagar come under Ghazipur police station.

  Lucknow   said, “Residents of areas under these police stations can now lodge an   sitting in any part of the world. They can also track investigation of their cases online. Police will now also make a digital diary entry that will make their accountability greater towards complainants,” said Kumar.
 
 Kumar also added that the model will be replicated in other police stations soon.
