Jaipur: Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ) protested in front of the Vice-Chancellor Secretariat on Monday at Rajasthan University. They burnt an effigy of Ashok Nagawat who is handling the selection committee alleging corruption in the recruitment process of the Rajasthan University and irregularities in the MPAT exam. 

 The students shouted slogans against vice-chancellor R K Kothari, Ashok Nagawat and university administration. They also demanded the resignation of Nagawat alleging that he was involved in corruption during the recruitment process. Many candidates have also alleged that even after being more qualified and eligible, candidates with lower qualifications are being selected.
 
 Husyar Meena, unit president of ABVP said, “Nagawat is a member of all the important committees of the University and is acting like a dictator by making and breaking rules according to his whims and fancies. The administration changed the MPAT cut off marks to 50% violating UGC guidelines, the result for the recruitment of faculty members is not displayed on the website. We demand that MPAT should be done according to the old regulations and also to change new rules for the negative marking in exams.”
 
 ABVP has declared that if these demands are not accepted then the agitation in front of the VC Secretariat will continue longer.
