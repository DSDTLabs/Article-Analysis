NEW DELHI: The capital is likely to get a relief from the rising mercury next week with light rain and thundershowers forecast for the capital on Tuesday and  , Met officials said.

 Delhi’s maximum  , which touched 31.2 degrees Celsius, is forecast to go up to nearly 34 degrees over the next few days. However, officials say light showers will help in regulating this and once again bring down the maximum by three to four degrees celsius.
 
 “The capital will see light rain and thundershowers on Wednesday evening and night, as well as on   morning. Before this, temperature may touch close to 34 degrees but the rain will once again bring it down to 30 degrees, which is normal for this time of the season,” said Kuldeep Shrivastav, scientist at the Regional   Forecasting Centre in Delhi.
 
 Shrivastav said the rain will be caused due to an active western disturbance. The western disturbance will also see showers take place further up north. “Several places in the plains will see some rain which will bring down the maximum temperature in these areas.”
 
 The minimum temperature in the capital on Saturday was recorded at 17.5 degrees Celsius — one notch above normal for the season, while the humidity oscillated between 24 to 71% in the last 24 hours. The highest maximum temperature was recorded at Palam observatory where it touched 32.3 degrees Celsius, officials said.
 
 Tuesday was the hottest day of the season so far, when the mercury touched 36.2 degrees Celsius. Officials said while temperatures generally rise above 35 degrees in the latter half of March, the upcoming spell of rain is likely to regulate that.
