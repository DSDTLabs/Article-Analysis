NEW DELHI: The brother of 26-year-old   (name changed), who had streamed his   on  , said that he had seen   in his older sibling.

 “My brother expressed his frustration saying that nothing was going right in his career. He had done a course in aviation after investing a lot of money, but couldn’t get a job,” said the younger brother, Amit.
 
 After having lunch, he left for a party at Chhatarpur around 5pm.
 
 The two talked around 8.30pm when Aniket said that he was going to sleep after having dinner.
 
 “Around 1am, I got the call from my friend saying that my brother was attempting to kill himself. I boarded an autorickshaw and reached my house by 1.30am,” the man said.
 
 As Amit entered the room, he found his brother’s body hanging with the ceiling fan, the face blue. “I thought he had passed away as his tongue had come out and he had urinated in his pants. The autorickshaw driver refused to help,” he said.
 
 Amit lifted his brother and stood there for at least 10 minutes. He then pulled a chair and made his brother stand on it. “I contacted my neighbour and he untied the noose while I lifted my brother’s legs. He was unconscious, but breathing faintly,” he said.
 
 Around 1.50am, Amit took his brother to the nearest hospital and also gave him CPR. By 4.30am, Aniket was revived. “He is fine now and has been taken to a rehabilitation centre for counselling,” Amit said.
