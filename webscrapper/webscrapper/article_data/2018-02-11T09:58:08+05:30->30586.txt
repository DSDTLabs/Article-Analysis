After getting married at a simple, private ceremony in the USA, former actress   and her husband Arun Kumar had a reception party at Houston.
The actress looked resplendent in her golden coloured lehenga, paired with matching, elegant accessories and hairdo, in the photos of the function that went
 viral on social media, recently.
 
 Divyaa's daughter and son are also seen in the video of the function. It's in early February that Divya tied the knot with Arun Kumar, who is a software engineer in the US. Though a lot of trolls aiming at her decision to marry circulated online, many also came in support of Divya, who was earlier married to Dr Sudhir. 
 
 It's in the 2013 film 'Musafir' that Divya acted last in Malayalam, in which she made an appearance as herself.
