PUNE: Some persons chopped and stole four sandalwood trees worth Rs 20,000 from   on Tuesday morning.

 The incident came to light after Dinesh Deshpande, security in-charge of the Raj Bhavan, noticed the chopped trees. He immediately lodged a complaint with the Chatushrungi police. The trees were aged between eight to 10 years.
 
  An officer from the Chatushrungi police said one side of the Raj Bhavan premises can be accessed from Kasturba slums and the suspects may have entered and escaped from there. 
 
 “We are questioning the residents of   slum to see if they noticed any person/s carrying   with them in the early hours of Tuesday,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said that there are no   cameras at the main gate of the building. “Since the past few years only one guard has been deployed there. It is not possible for one person to guard the huge premises,” he added.
