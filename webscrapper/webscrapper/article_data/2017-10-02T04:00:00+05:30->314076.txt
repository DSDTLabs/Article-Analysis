Surat:   

 The Tazia processions are taken out on Muharram to pay homage to the sacrifices of Hazrat Imam Hussain and his companions at Karbala.
 
 Tazia processions began from different parts of the city at around 2.30pm. Tazia procession from Limbayat passed through Jhampabazar, Kamela Darwaja and Moto Talkies of Rajmarg. It also passed through Bhagal, Lalgate, Chowk Bazar and Hodi Bungalow. More than 500 vehicles with colourful Tazia, burakh, akhada, water and sharbat lorries passed through Rajmarg and reached Variyali Bazaar. Tazia processions from different directions converged at Bhagal where mayor, police commissioner and Swami Amrishanand gave away prizes to the first 10 that reached there early. 
 
 Thousands of people gathered on both sides of the roads to get a glimpse of the Tazias. There was a tight police bandobast for the occasion.
 
 A Tazia Visarjan Committee member said, “We wanted the processions to pass through Rajmarg before 7.30pm. We are happy that the programme went off peacefully.”
 
 Tazia Action Committee vice-president Asad Kalyani said, “Like in the past years, this time too, the processions went off well. Communal harmony is Surat city’s main characteristics.”
