LUDHIANA: Disability can be an obstacle for many people, but not 11-year-old Kamaljeet Singh. Unable to write with his hands because of a congenital problem, this Class V student of Government Primary School, Sahauli, has been writing all his exams with his right foot.

 And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The spirited boy, with a disarming smile, topped the annual exam of his class last year.
 
 On Friday, a TOI team visited Kamaljeet’s school when he was appearing in his Class V exam. During the visit, TOI came face to face with the boy who has been taking all challenges in life with a smile on his face. Even during the exam, Kamaljeet sat on a mat and wrote his exam, while his classmates sat on benches.
 
 In spite of the obvious challenge he faced, Kamaljeet completed his exam within time and neatly. The school’s head teacher,  , calls Kamaljeet an “intelligent and obedient” student. “When I joined this school last year, I was touched by his spirit. From taking part in the morning prayer to all other activities, Kamaljeet enjoys his school life to the fullest,” Gurpreet said.
 
 Kamaljeet’s father   was told about his son’s disability at his birth. “They broke the news to me as soon as I held him in my arms,” he says. , “I earn only Rs 8,000 per month and cannot afford his treatment. Doctors have told that after a few operations Kamaljeet would start walking properly.”
 
 
 
 
 Santokh says Kamaljeet was not even able to walk till the age of eight. “He was bed ridden. When my younger son used to play with me, Kamaljeet would feel sad. Once he said I had made no efforts to make him walk. After that I kept him taking to all medical camps and doctors I could afford,” he says.
 
 The turnaround in Kamaljeet’s life came three years ago, with the NGO ‘Nai Zindagi Nai Udaan’. The NGO sponsored an operation of Kamaljeet’s feet, after which he started to walk. However, his knees still do not bend due to which he needs support to get up and sit down.
