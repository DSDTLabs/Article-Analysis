CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Saturday stayed the orders passed by Kapurthala-based permanent   that had restrained the highway authorities from collecting toll at Ladhowal plaza for not taking any road safety measures. Ladhowal toll tax plaza is located on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway.

 Justice Daya Chaudhary of the HC passed these orders after hearing a petition filed by Panipat-Jalandhar NH-1 Tollway Private Ltd. 
 
 The counsel appearing for the company, Sumeet Goel, had submitted that the restrain orders were passed by the Lok Adalat at the back of the petitioner and the lok adalat has no jurisdiction to pass such orders as per the provisions contained in Legal Services Authorities Act 1987.
 
 Goel also informed the HC that March 15 and April 17, 2018 orders have been complied with.
 
 Hearing this, Justice Daya Chaudhary adjourned the hearing of the case for April 24 and ordered a stay on Lok Adalat’s orders that had restrained the concessionaires from collecting toll.
 
 On March 15, Kapurthala Lok Adalat chairperson Manju Rana had directed the NHAI to close illegal accesses to the NHAI and ensure barricading. 
 
 On April 17, the Lok Adalat was informed that not a single step had been taken for smooth and safe movement of traffic. “NHAI is stopped from charging toll tax at Ladhowal toll tax barrier near  , on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway, till the compliance of the order dated March 15, 2018, as toll tax is charged not as revenue for the government, but it is primarily charged for construction of the toll road and collecting charges as toll taxes later on. But the NHAI has failed to do its duty in a proper manner,” judge Rana noted in her order.
