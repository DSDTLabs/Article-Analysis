KOLKATA: The Centre has barred   from using beacons but it has not been a  , or so it seems. An amendment to Section 108 of  , 1989, has left a grey area that has prompted beacons to make a comeback atop VIP cars, this time in its blue avatar. And one look at the parking lot of Nabanna on Thursday made it amply clear that the   episode is far from over.

 The motor vehicles rule clearly states that no one — except ambulances — can flash red beacons but the omission of sub-rule 2, which deals with blue beacons, has left room for multiple interpretations, allowing many VIPs to continue flaunting the blue beacons on their car.
 
 The amendment is meant for doing away with the VIP culture in the country by abolishing beacons but this loophole in the sub-rule, experts say, defeats the purpose. According to them, the omission is deliberate to accommodate the ethos championed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had said “Everybody is important”. 
 
 Hitherto, sub-rule 2 of CMVR’s Section 108 empowered the state government to use its discretion to determine and notify which vehicles could use blue lights with flasher. But in the seventh amendment of the CMVR, the sub-rule 2 is omitted, leaving none — neither the central nor the state government — to decide which vehicle can use blue lights. This effectively means anyone can use blue lights with flasher as no one is authorized to stop the usage.
 
 The transport department officers said they can hardly do anything if every vehicle starts using a blue light with flasher. Nabanna sources said the final decision on beacons will be taken after the return of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.
