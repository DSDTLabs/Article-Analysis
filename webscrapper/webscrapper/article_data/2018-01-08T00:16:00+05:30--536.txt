Edited: 270 words Madurai: Four thousand Block Resource Teacher Educators (BRTEs) of the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) scheme, who have not been promoted as graduate teachers in government schools, have decided to wear black badges and attend work from Jan 8 to protest against the government’s failure to conduct conversion counselling for them. The meeting of the BRTEs was held in Dindigul on Sunday. State president of the All Resource Graduate Teachers Association, M Ravikumar said that the SSA program was implemented Tamil Nadu in the year 2002. In the year 2006, a GO was passed which said that BRTEs would be absorbed into the regular school system as graduate teachers, to teach from classes VI to X. This conversion from BRTEs to graduate teachers was done through counseling. It was conducted regularly till the year 2013 and 500 of them were brought under the regular school system each year. The government then stopped the process citing lack of funds. The teachers went to court and the HC passed orders in their favour. The government then appealed against it and in that too, the judgement was in favour of the BRTEs. Yet, the government failed to implement the court orders.  Later, the government informed the court that it would recruit new BRTEs and then consider the conversion transfers for the earlier batch, but that too has not been done till date. “Hence, we have decided to attend work till Pongal wearing black badges in all districts. If the government continues to fail us, we will resort to protests in front of the school education department till our demands are fulfilled,” Ravikumar said.
