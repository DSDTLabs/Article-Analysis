 — Dhanu ( ), Tanu ( ) and Manu ( ) — who have been hiding their true identity of being undercover agents, will face yet another challenge in the upcoming track of the show, 'Trideviyaan', which airs Monday to Friday at 9.30 pm on Sony SAB. Shaurya ( ) and Trideviyaan are on a mission to catch the dwarf who steals a missile made for the Indian Army. Tracking its location, Trideviyaan manage to reach him, but the shrewd dwarf somehow dodges them every time. At last, Trideviyaan succeed in getting hold of him. However, Shaurya realises that the arrested dwarf doesn’t have the real missile. The one 
who has it, is still on the run. 
 Commenting on this new challenge, Aishwarya says, “This is an interesting track where Trideviyaan catch the wrong thief. The role is played by   who is a very good actor and a comedian. Thus we could easily manage our comic timing with him. It was fun to shoot with him.”
