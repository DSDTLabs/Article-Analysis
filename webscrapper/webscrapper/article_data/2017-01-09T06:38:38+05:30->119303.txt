 may be God’s own country but Rajasthan’s   has God’s own art. 

 Now, the twain have come together at the Kochi art biennale where, for the first time, Nathdwara’s traditional   paintings are on display along with the best of contemporary art.
 
 It’s perhaps fitting because the   too have found a new avatar. Disappointed that the artists of Nathdwara, a temple town where the Pichvai originated, were churning out cheap souvenirs rather than the intricate work they’re famous for, Delhi designer Pooja Singhal embarked on a six-year-long research project aimed at not only reviving the art but giving it a contemporary twist.
 
 “I researched old compositions, trained new artists and found a way to get my hands on natural colours made from grinding stones, a particular cloth from a calico mill and handmade layered paper called basli that the old-timers used,” says Udaipur-born Singhal, who inherited a love of Pichvais from her mother. Pichvais show Lord Srinathji (Krishna) in different moods, settings and seasons.
 
 The experimentation started when Singhal tried to find ways to get this art to modern living-rooms. “Earlier pichvais were really big wall hangings not suitable for small flats. So we found some out-of-work miniature artists and asked them to work on a 12-inch by 12-inch size,” she says.
 
  The results are quite unique. The Chaubees Swaroop (24 miracles of Krishna) have been deconstructed into small miniature works framed with Mughal jaalis. Religious iconography has given way to a more secular iteration in a series titled Lotus.
 
 The signature temple map, rendered in black and white, has already been snapped up by a Swedish collector. As Singhal, who runs an atelier in Udaipur, very practically points out, there can’t be a revival without commerce. “People have to stop thinking of this art form as traditional and start thinking of it as timeless.”
