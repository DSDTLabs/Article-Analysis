NEW DELHI: It's getting increasingly difficult to figure out what's going on with the rift in   (SP) founder  's family.

 Yesterday, Mulayam was conspicuous by his absence at a key event to release the party's election manifesto for the upcoming state polls, which lead to speculation that all is still not copacetic in the family. 
 
 But then last night, his son and Uttar Pradesh chief minister  , posted a photograph on Facebook that seemed to indicate there is no rift.
 
 In the photo, Akhilesh and his wife Dimple are standing next to a seated Mulayam, smiling as they show the SP founder the manifesto. (Mulayam isn't smiling, though.)
 
 
  
 
 "Today's manifesto takes forward the path of development we have done so far. It further empowers the farmers, youth and the women of UP," Akhilesh's Facebook post said. Yesterday's event was also the first appearance by Akhilesh after he became party chief in a sort of bloodless coup, after the Election Commission awarded the SP's electoral symbol the 'cycle'. The SP faction that supports Mulayam and his brother Shivpal lost that battle. 
 
 Then the SP announced a list of candidates that did include Akhilesh's uncle Shivpal, prompting some to think the rift was finally mended. But then again Mulayam's and Shivpal's absence yesterday triggered a new round of speculation. 
 
 The only certain thing so far appears to be the SP-Congress alliance announced yesterday. The   managed to wrangle 105 seats for itself, even as it was appearing an alliance may not happen, as the Congress wanted to contest as many as 121 seats. But the two reached a compromise just before Akhilesh released the manifesto.
 
 As he released the manifesto, Akhilesh promised smartphones for the state's meritorious students, pressure cookers for the state's women and a pension scheme of Rs 1,000 for 1 crore of the state's women, among many other things.
