NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   on Saturday accused the   government in   of destroying the 'Switzerland of India' and depriving the state of development for years. 

 "Congress is in power for the last 15 years in Manipur but it has not done anything to develop the state," PM Modi said while addressing an 
  at Langjing Achouba ground in Manipur's capital Imphal. 
 
 "There will never be an 
  when BJP comes to power in Manipur, I assure you this," he added.
 
 He also assured voters that "if voted to power in upcoming polls, they will do everything in 15 months what Congress did not do in the last 15 years."
 
 The Manipur assembly elections will be held in two phases - March 4 and 8 - to elect 60 members of the state legislative assembly.
 
 “After coming to power in Lok Sabha elections in 2014, we came out with ‘Act East Policy’. As we believed that the country wouldn't develop until our eastern part prospers," Modi said, adding, "Unity of Manipur, the welfare of its people and development of the state is the only goal of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)." 
 
 Highlighting the progess made by BJP-ruled states, PM Modi said, “Today, every BJP governed state is progressing at a fast pace and wherever Congress government is in power, the state lacks progress."
 
 "Former Prime Minister   had made policies for overall development of north-eastern states but the Congress party didn't carry the work forward," Modi said while attacking Congress-led state government. 
 
 Urging the people to uproot the corrupt government in Manipur, Modi asked them to "end" the Congress and "bring" BJP in the state.
