BENGALURU: Chief minister   recently announced that  , which will dish out food at affordable prices, will be operational within two months in all 198 wards. But meeting the deadline won’t be easy as BBMP is finding it hard to locate space for the facilities, especially in core Bengaluru.

 S Anand Kumar, chairperson, standing committee on public health, BBMP, said civic officials in each ward have been asked to suggest three options for vacant spaces/government-owned buildings where Namma Canteens can be housed. “Joint commissioners of east, west, south, Rajarajeshwari Nagar,  , Bommanahalli, Mahadevapura and Yelahanka zones have been told to compile the list in their respective jurisdiction. Some JCs have submitted the lists, while the others are still putting them together,” he added. 
 
 Though space is readily available in outer zones like Mahadevapura, Bommanahalli, RR Nagar and Dasarahalli, it is a problem in core city areas. “We want the officials to look for BBMP-owned land/property or other government-owned space on priority. We don’t want to hire private spaces, which may run into roadblocks later. However, if we don’t find government space in all core areas, we may have to rent private buildings,” said an official.
 
 The canteens modelled on Tamil Nadu’s   intend to cater to communities like autorickshaw drivers, construction workers, daily-wage labourers and students. They are likely to benefit the 15-20 lakh floating population of the city every day. The breakfast menu is likely to include avalakki bath, chow chow bath, pongal and upma. The lunch platter will include rice, sambar, a vegetable dish, pickle and buttermilk. While breakfast will cost Rs 5, for lunch one has to pay Rs 10.
