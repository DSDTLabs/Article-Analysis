NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) leader   has expressed serious disagreement with   over forming the government in Bihar with BJP, calling it an “unfortunate” decision which is against the mandate of the people of the state.

 “I don’t agree with the decision in Bihar, it’s unfortunate. The mandate by the people was not for this,” Yadav told reporters, bringing the murmurs in JD(U) over Nitish’s decision out in the open.
 
 Sharad Yadav had slammed the Modi government on Saturday, tweeting that neither black money stashed abroad had come, one of the main promises of BJP, nor was anyone named in the Panama Papers caught. 
 
  chief   has extended an invitation to Sharad, urging him to lead the battle against the BJP in Bihar after the collapse of the Mahagatbandhan.
 
 Hours after Sharad Yadav’s strong comments, Nitish defended his decision, saying he would not not compromise with corruption.
 
 Party sources said Nitish has asked his colleagues not to react to Sharad Yadav even if the latter is critical and vocal about the alliance with BJP. Party insiders say the Bihar CM is in no mood to lock horns with the senior leader and continues with his efforts to pacify him.
 
 “Everyone should fall in line with the party president’s decision. There are leaders raising questions about why the leadership is so lenient on Yadav. However, Nitish Kumar wants that Yadav should retain his position as a senior leader in party,” said a senior JD(U) leader.
 
 JD(U)’s Rajya Sabha MPs —Veerendra Kumar and Ali Anwar —have openly criticised Nitish's move to break away from the ‘Grand Alliance’. 
 
 Party sources said prior to his quitting as CM and forming the next government with BJP, Nitish had a three-hour meeting with Yadav during which the latter was briefed about the plan in detail.
 
 “The CM reportedly reminded Yadav about how he had quit after his name had figured in the   case while FIR had been registered against Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav,” said a source.
