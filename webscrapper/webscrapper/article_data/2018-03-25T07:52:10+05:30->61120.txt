PALANPUR: At a time when many parts of the state are facing severe drinking water crisis, Eklava village with a population of over 1,200 in   taluka of  , has set an example for water conservation using traditional rainwater harvesting technique. 

 Of the 250-odd households in the village, 62 have adopted the traditional rainwater harvesting technique over the past 12 years. “Over a decade ago, women and children of our village used to walk several kilometres to fetch water. Fights over water was a common phenomenon,” sarpanch of Eklava village   said.
 
 “Like any other village in border district of Patan and Banaskantha, the drinking water here was highly saline and unhygienic. This was our fate then,” he added. 
 
 In 2005, people from   of   came to the village and introduced them to traditional rainwater harvesting techniques (TRWHT). Using this technique, underground water tank is built near the house and all the rain water during monsoon is diverted into it. This water is then used for drinking and cooking purposes throughout the year. “Now, we have water stored in our backyard. All we have to do is just pump it out using a hand pump,” Chaudhary said. “This has put an end to fights over water and agitation against the district authorities.”
 
 He said that in 2005 these families paid Rs 4,500 for setting up the system, while the remaining expenses were borne by Motibhai Foundation. 
 
 Dayabhai Sadhu, whose family was one of the firsts to adopt the TRWHT system, said, “We are able to store 15,000 litre of rainwater in our underground tank. It is sufficient for our family of five. Not only has it saved our time in fetching water, but also reduced our visits to the doctor, which was very frequent earlier.”
 
 Sadhu said that 200 other families of the village are ready to adopt the system. But the system has become costly so they are waiting for some government programme for financial support.
