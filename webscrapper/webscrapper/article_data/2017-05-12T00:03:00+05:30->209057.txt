Indore: A 36-year-old woman was gangraped at knife point by two men, who offered her lift in their four-wheeler late on Wednesday.

 The incident took place when the woman was on her way from Badnavar to Indore after a religious tour and was waiting for a bus at Badi Chowpati.
 
 Badnavar police said that two persons came in a four-wheeler and offered her a lift. As the woman knew them, she sat inside the vehicle after they promised to drop her Indore.
 
 The accused stopped the vehicle at Jayaswal Dhabha in Gadgara village and allegedly took turns to   the woman at knife point. They also threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone, said police.
 
 After committing the crime, the accused fled the scene after leaving the woman on the spot. She somehow managed to gather the villagers and asked for help. They took her to Badnavar police station where a case was registered.
 
 “The woman was sent for medical examination and a case was registered against the accused. Two accused including Narendra Verma and Manohar were arrested and booked under relevant sections of the IPC and produced before the court. Further investigations in the case are on,” said Badnavar police station in-charge Sunil Gupta while speaking to TOI.
