MELBOURNE: Maria  , returning to the venue where she tested positive for Meldonium two years ago, received a warm reception from a near full-house. The 30-year-old responded by pulling off a 6-1, 6-4 first-round win against   Maria to advance to a potentially tricky   second round meeting with Anastasija Sevastova. Sharapova, who struggled with her serve, as has been the trend since her return to competition last April following a 15-month doping ban, however, slammed 22 winners.

 The Russian, sporting a flattering blush-pink dress, ran away with the first set in the only 30-something first-round matchup in the women's draw here.
 
 Tatjana, got into the exchange with her single-fisted backhand, forcing two successive errors from Sharapova that saw her serve broken in the third game. Interestingly the German used to hit her backhand with both hands on the stick until her pregnancy break in early 2013.
 
 On her return she switched to the single hander with help from her husband and coach Charles Edouard Maria. The couple have a four-year-old daughter. "It felt pretty routine," Sharapova said after her first match in Melbourne in two years. "I got a lot of things out of the way, physically, emotionally and mentally last year. A lot of firsts again for me, playing the first tournament, first Grand Slam. But it felt pretty routine today, just really happy to be back here."
 
 The Russian, who'll next play  , the 14thseed, with who she split two meetings last year, beating the Latvian in Beijing after falling to her in the US Open. "I missed a lot of swing volleys at the US Open. My father made me hit swing volleys till I was blue in the face when I got back. I felt like I did improve on that and was moving forward and being a little bit more consistent (in Beijing).
 
 "But, yeah, it's not an easy match for anyone, especially for an aggressive player like me." 
 
 
 
 
 
 Melbourne: Johanna Konta decided to address her blueberry craving two days ago. She treated herself to two boxes. "I went to the supermarket to buy blueberries. I only bought blueberries. Two punts," she explained, stressing on the details. "I left the two punts of blueberries there! It's $5 that I won't get back!"
 
 "It's actually more the betrayal in my own mind. I feel so upset about it. I went to the shop and left them there. I was so sad. I don't know where my mind was," she said, laughing, then adding that she hasn't got over the incident. "I now need to go again to buy blueberries." Konta, 26, realized she hadn't brought back her shopping bag only when she returned to her hotel room. "I was already changed into my PJs and thinking, wait a second, where's my blueberries? Oh, my gosh, I know!"
 
 
 
 Melbourne: Judy Murray likened 23-year-old Kyle  's (left) gear at the Australian Open, a pink and black combination, to a 'kit of licorice'. Judy, Andy Murray's mother, also a tennis coach, has a way with words. "I don't think pink really suits me," Edmund, who shocked South African   in the first round, said. "I think if you have a better tan, it would suit you. But it's all right. It is what it is."
 
 He added that he didn't have much of a say in the designing of his gear. "They want you to wear a certain kit for each tournament. That was the kit for this tournament, so here I am..." he said.
