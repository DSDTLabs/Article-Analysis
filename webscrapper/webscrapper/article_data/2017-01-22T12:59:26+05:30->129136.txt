  "I didn't expect at all that I could be the Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa winner as I was competing with two great dancers Shantanu and Salman bhaiya. I would like to thank all my fans and celebrity friends who promoted and requested everyone to vote for me," shared Teriya.
  
  Describing her Jhalak journey, Teriya said, "My Jhalak journey has been a rollercoaster ride. The worst moment was when I was eliminated, but I was lucky that I returned to the show.

  When asked about her future plans and if she is open to acting, Teriya said, "Yes, why not? If any interesting opportunity comes my way I would love to act in Bollywood or TV. Many of my friends have switched from dancing to acting and they are doing well in career. They still dance and are acting also so if I also get a chance I will definitely take it up."
  
  On being asked, about the prize money, she said, "When the last time I won Dance Indian Dance I had donated some amount of the prize money to a foundation on my name Teriya foundation. It works for education of underprivileged kids. So this time too I will contribute some amount for them."
