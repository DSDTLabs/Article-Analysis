 Solar energy consultant  , told GEDA officials and the electricity department that the Goa State Solar Policy 2017 itself states that all solar and renewable power projects would be initiated through GEDA, which is the nodal agency of the ministry of new and renewable energy, and which will serve as a single window to deal with projects.
 
 Solar system integrators, who were attending the second edition of the   in the capital, also questioned the roles of the electricity department and GEDA.  , an integrator, appealed to the government to consider reducing the eligibility criteria for solar installation projects. He said local companies could not bid for tenders as the tapping of solar power is yet to kick off in the state and local solar system integrators didnâ€™t have the required experience. He further pointed out that people from other states were bidding for solar projects while locals were being disqualified at the initial stage itself.
 
 In response, GEDA member secretary  , said the government has decided to set up a committee to resolve issues and problems faced by those in the solar power industry.
