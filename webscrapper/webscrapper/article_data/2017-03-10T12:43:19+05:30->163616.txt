 has penned two screenplays and they have both been trashed by his filmmaker father and brother,   and  . Unfazed and all smiles, the 29-year-old actor admits that while his brother pulled his leg, his father didn't think it was good enough either. 

  
  
 "I have two directors at home and take their honest opinions really seriously. Maybe these screenplays did not measure up. But I also feel that the storylines were not to their taste and style of filmmaking," says Varun, who wasn't disheartened and instead, put it down as a learning experience, continuing to write. "Now I am working towards writing something far darker, the kind of film I've always wanted to do and I want to produce it too, maybe act in it as well," Varun beams.
 
 However, before he gets down to filming anything, he discusses his projects with his father, mentor   and a couple of close friends who have nothing to do with the film industry to get their perspective on his story. "I usually sum up the crux of the plot and share it with them in a two-line brief to gauge their reaction," says Varun, who while studying acting and filmmaking, had directed and featured in around eight short films. "I was often shooting these films on my cell phone but I don't want to go back to doing that because I'm a 70-mm actor now and I don't know how a short film from me will be received. Instead, I'd want to focus on a full-length feature which will work commercially and enable me to do many more films."
