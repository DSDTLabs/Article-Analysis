BOKARO: An 18-year-old  , who went missing on March 22, was found in an unconscious state in   near   Thermal colony on Saturday. The girl alleged that she was raped by her supervisor, an employee of a private coal mining firm, at her residence for three days.

 According to the police, Mihinaj Ansari, a resident of Gandhinagar area, raped the 18-year-old at his residence at Bokaro Thermal colony and promised to marry her. “He applied vermillion on her forehead and threatened her with dire consequences if she reported the incident to anyone,” Rajesh Kujur, officer-in-charge of Bokaro Thermal police station, said.
 
 The incident, Kujur said, took place when Ansari reportedly offered the girl to drop her home after a marriage ceremony. “The victim alleged that on March 22, when she was returning home after attending a marriage, Ansari met her on the way. He offered to drop her home on his motorbike,” the police officer said.
 
 However, instead of dropping her home, he took her to his house in Bokaro Thermal colony and raped her several for three days. On Saturday, one of his friends left the girl inside Pilpilo jungle, Kujur added.
 
 The victim’s family, who had launched a search for her, found her in an unconscious state in Pilpilo forest. The parents immediately lodged a complaint with Bermo Thermal police who then sent the victim to a government hospital for medical examination.
 
 “The girl is in a state of shock. The parents had alerted the police after their daughter did not return home that night,”a police official of Bermo Thermal police station. 
 
 “We have launched a hunt for Ansari who has gone into hiding since the incident,” Kujur said.
