CHANDIGARH:   (SAD)   on Sunday said Congress vice-president   cut short his Punjab tour because he was put off by the party’s “lackluster performance” in parts of the state and instead went to Uttar Pradesh, where the party has high stakes.

 He referred to an email purportedly written by Punjab Congress former president Partap Bajwa to Rahul that has gone viral on social media. Congress has called the email in question fake.
 
 Chandumajra said it also indicated that the ground was slipping from under the feet of the Congress. “The authenticity of the email may be suspicious, but the fact that Rahul cut short his tour is a fact. The party has failed to offer a credible explanation for his abrupt exit to Uttar Pradesh, where the elections are far off. Speculations are rife that Rahul committed a political blunder by projecting the party’s state president, Capt Amarinder Singh, as its chief ministerial candidate to boost the sagging morale of the party.
 
 In the letter, Bajwa conceded that Punjab unit had split into three factions of Captain (Amarinder Singh), Sherry (Navjot Singh Sidhu) and PK (Prashant Kishore) and this was hurting the party in Majha and Doaba, while it had already been relegated to the third position in Malwa. Chandumajra said the Congress’s strategy to induct Sidhu in the party and declare Amarinder as party’s the CM face a few days had not gone well with rank and file of the party.
