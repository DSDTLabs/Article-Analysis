LUDHIANA: Special Task Force (STF) nabbed another   having direct links with those based in Pakistan from a checkpoint near Sherpur Chowk on Sunday evening. They have also recovered 1kg heroin from his possession, that he had buried in a plot in Sangowal village near   of Sidhwan canal. According to police, 1kg heroin costs Rs 5 crore in the international market.

 Significantly, the arrested accused Jaswant Kumar (57) of Amritsar is the main link of the chain of drug peddlers, claim police.
 
 Earlier on July 11, STF had arrested a drug peddler of Tarantaran Gurnam Singh and his two accomplices Daljit Singh and Swaran Singh with 4kg heroin from Kakke Dhaula village of Ludhiana. Later on July 19 STF had also arrested two NRIs Palwinderjeet Singh Sidhu (43) and   (41) of Gorayan, Jalandhar with 5kg heroin.
 
 STF in-charge Harbans Singh said, “Recently Jaswant had recently got 11kg heroin from a Pakistani smuggler out of which he had delivered 4 kg to Gurnam and 5 kg to the   smugglers. Jaswant has direct links with Pakistani smugglers, whom he would connect with through whatsapp calls.”
 
 He further said that Jaswant has been into drug peddling for over 20 years. In 1996, he was held by Amritsar police with 44kg heroin and later with 85kg heroin. He was also sentenced to 16 years of imprisonment in Amritsar. After completing the term, he came out of jail three years back and restarted drug peddling. He smuggled contrabands in Delhi and Haryana too. 
 
 “STF has almost broken this chain of drug peddlers by arresting Jaswant, Gurnam and the NRIs. Just one peddler Saheb Singh is absconding. He too will be in the police net soon,” added Harbans.
