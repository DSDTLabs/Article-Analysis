What happens when a young poet comes out to his mother? Shiva traces the journey of a poet named Shiv, and how he opens up to his mother about his   through poems and letters that deal with the theme of conviction, fear, choice and a childâ€™s longing for acceptance. 

  A confluence of theatre, dance and Carnatic music, Shiva is about the journey of gender identity and sexuality of ordinary people, which culminates into Shiv's journey. 
 
  The play will be staged at Ranga Shankara on February 20 at 7.30 pm.
