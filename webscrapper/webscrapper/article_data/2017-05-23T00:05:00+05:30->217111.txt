“Body confidence is not limited to clutching a designer handbag, sipping wine at a posh restaurant or talking a selfie and posting it on social media,” says immersive   expert  . She is all set to conduct a unique   in Bengaluru soon, at which participants will experience how aspects of their bodies and voice, and not body-image hacks on the internet, can make an impact.

 , this workshop aims at exploring the ways through which one can move, respond and transform, while also focusing on gesture and voice patterns. Based on elements of performance arts, this workshop will help one to push boundaries and experience new possibilities.
 
  “In this age of hyper mass media, everyone — particularly women — seems to be too preoccupied with the ‘ideal’ body image. There is a lot of pressure on people to look good and presentable at all times. This workshop strives to help people break free from this mindset and change the way they perceive their bodies and each other’s. The special sessions will enable participants to live the world through their senses. It’s a reflective process that inspires one to look inward and gain self-confidence. It is performance with their body which, in turn, will make them feel uplifted and love themselves,” explains Aruna.
 
  Although this   project is primarily crafted for women, “it’s intriguing to see how men, as well as elderly women, are taking interest in it”, she adds. The special performance session will take place at   over the weekend.
