IMPHAL: A day after BJP general secretary   said the party will set aside the North East Democratic Alliance (Neda) and contest the assembly elections alone, the Nagaland People's Front (NPF) released its list of candidates for 15 constituencies, in most of which it will fight it out with both Congress and BJP. 

 Of the 15 seats NPF has fielded candidates in, four constituencies - Saikul, Kangpokpi, Saitu and Henglep - are Kuki-dominated. The candidates for these seats are Thangboi Haokip, LK Chongloi, Sehpu Haokip and Thongjamlen Haokip, respectively. 
 
 All four former legislators from NPF - Samuel Risom (Ukhrul),   (Karong), Dikho (Mao) and   (Chandel) - are on the party's list. The four had resigned from the assembly, denouncing the passage of three Inner Line Permit-like bills by the assembly on August 31, 2015. NPF has said the statutes go against the interests of the tribals and the Nagas.
 
 Lawyer-turned-politician Samuel will take on Congress candidate   and ace footballer Somatai Shaiza of BJP in the Tangkhul-dominated Ukhrul constituency.
 
 Jiribam, which has a mixed population of Meiteis, tribals and non-Manipuris, will witness an NPF candidate, M Kamei, joining the fray for the first time. Located along the Assam border, Jiribam is one the seven districts that have been created recently - over which the state has been under siege with an economic blockade imposed on the two national highways of the state by the   (UNC). 
 
 Notably, a mammoth Naga village authorities' meeting, organized by the UNC at Yaikhong Pao village in October last year, had decided to support NPF. Nagaland chief minister and NPF leader TR Zeliang, who attended the gathering, had appealed to the people to support the party. 
 
 NPF is likely to release its election manifesto on Tuesday at a function at Mao, bordering Nagaland, said a source in the party.
