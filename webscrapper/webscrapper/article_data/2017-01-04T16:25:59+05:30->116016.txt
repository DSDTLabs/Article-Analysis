HYDERABAD: The ongoing strike by Uber and Ola cab drivers has resulted in revenue gain for Meru Cabs, which has seen a tremendous increase in the number of people reaching out to them over the past four days. While   have seen around 50 per cent increase in city rides, auto drivers said that they have seen about 30 per cent increase in the number of passengers. 

 "In Hyderabad, we have seen an increase of around 50 per cent in demand for city rides. Meru has always believed in transparent and fair pricing and continue to serve customers without any 'surge price' despite peak demand," said Nilesh Sangoi, CEO, Meru Cabs. 
 
 The CEO of Meru also said that in the past three days, they have seen five times increase in their app download rate. Likewise, Telangana Auto Drivers Samaikya general secretary A Sathi Reddy said they had seen a significant increase in number of people taking autos. "What these taxi aggregators are doing is illegal and at the beginning, we protested against them. But with time we realized that there is no point in fighting and started educating our people."
 
 Another beneficiary of this strike happens to be Sky Cabs. According to an official, even they have seen a considerable rise in the demand for cabs.
