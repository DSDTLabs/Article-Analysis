CHENNAI: Unregulated vehicle parking, especially cabs operated by taxi aggregator apps, and   put up by street   is hindering traffic movement on the   near Tidel Park junction.

 The presence of a large number of cabs is inconveniencing locals from nearby residential neighbourhoods. “Cabs park haphazardly on the road. During peak hours, it becomes difficult to reach the OMR service road without bumping into cab drivers,” said Rajan, a local resident.
 
 Cab drivers told TOI that they had nowhere else to park their vehicles. “Our customers work at the IT parks. If we wait here, we have a better chance of picking up rides,” said a cab driver, who did not want to be named.
 
 A traffic policeman, Silambarasan, who reports to duty at the police outpost on Film City Road, told TOI that   movement on the road was a challenge but it was “nothing that could not be managed.”
 
 Vendors moved into the road after Greater Chennai Corporation evicted footpath vendors from near the Ascendas building and Ramanujam IT park a few months ago. Temporary structures using asbestos sheets fin lieu of roofs have been raised on the storm water drain infrastructure on the road. One stall had set up shop on a raised concrete platform by the roadside.
 
 P Balaji, a passerby, told TOI that the shops had set up stalls closer to the drain to dump trash. “If you go around to the back of these stalls, you would find plastic waste and food being thrown into the drain via an opening,” he said.
 
 Uncleared garbage is also a common sight. Near the government-run catering institute on the road, plastic and food waste pile-up on a daily basis. A corporation official attached to Adyar (Zone 13) told TOI that the road did not fall under their jurisdiction. “We do not maintain the road. So, we cannot move against the vendors,” the official said, adding that he will look into the uncleared garbage on the road.
