JAIPUR: Amajor crisis facing   is one that the authorities are not even ready to acknowledge or address in a systematic manner. The holy city has an abundance of abandoned cows, both old as well as ill. The numbers are beyond the capacity of city to handle. With every passing day , the bovines are increasing in the narrow lanes and bylanes of the holy city, defeating the local administration's cleanliness efforts.

 Since the fear of `gau rakshaks' has become acute, people from nearby villages and towns find it `beneficial' and safer to release their old and ill cows rather than keeping them at their home or sell them.
 
 “There must be around 500 cows in the city at present.Every day, we see more cows being released by villagers.Since cows have a holy significance for Hindus, nobody touches them or tries to shift them elsewhere,“ said  , a   counsellor.
 
 He added that with the rise in the number of abandoned cows, fodder sellers too have increased on city roads, thereby, increasing encroachments in the city. “Devotees and locals throw food to the cows wherever they spot them, making it difficult for us to maintain cleanliness in the city,“ he said.
 
 The local administration has asked the state government to provide land for building cow shelters. The two existing cow shelters in Pushkar are running full to their capacity . Unless more land is provided, these cows will continue to roam on city roads.“Now, I can't even touch a cow if she obstructs the way or sits outside my shop. The fear of vigilantes is so high that we don't even think of hitting a cow,“ said  , who has an antique shop in the main market.
 
 The local administration has identified land near Pushkar to shelter around 500 cows and has asked the state government for allocation. Experts say that if the land is allocated for a third cow shelter, it will be filled in a week. According to estimates, 90% of these abandoned animals come from outside the city.
