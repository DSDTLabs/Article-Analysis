KOLKATA: The   ( ), eastern zone bench, declared the   (SWZs) on the   as specially protected ones on Tuesday. There are two sweet water aquifers on the beach. 

 These are unique as there are only a few places in the world where sweet water sources are located so close to the sea. Even the British were aware of their importance and wouldn’t allow them to be tapped.
 
 The NGT has been hearing an application on environmental degradation in Puri, moved by green activist Subhas Datta, for over three years now. 
 
 The bench of Justice S P Wangdi and Prof P C Mishra, on Tuesday, directed that water can’t be drawn from these aquifers without permission. The sale, lease or transfer of land in the vicinity have also been declared as illegal and all existing constructions in the area will be treated as illegal.
 
 “All encroachments will have to be removed from the area and steps will be taken against those withdrawing water illegally,” the bench observed. The NGT also made rain water harvesting compulsory for Puri and directed that trade festivals not be held on the sea beach. Authorities in Odisha have already informed the bench that necessary measures have been taken to control the smoke and soot that emanates from the Swargadwar crematorium. Acting on past directions, open food stalls near Swargadwar, directly affected by the smoke and soot, have already been closed down. 
 
 The Odisha Pollution Control Board (OPCB), in its submission to the NGT has already criticized the solid waste management system in the temple town and the Puri Municipality has been directed to take immediate steps. The new sewage treatment plant (STP) at Bankimohun should also be completed within a year. 
 
 “An all-out effort will have to be made to improve the environment health of the town,” the NGT directed.
