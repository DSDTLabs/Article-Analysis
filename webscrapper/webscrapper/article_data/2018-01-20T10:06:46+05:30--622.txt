SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh assembly speaker Dr   on Friday met Union defence minister   in New Delhi and submitted some documents regarding the long pending land dispute between Army and the people of Nahan town. He apprised the Union minister of problems faced by families of ward number 12 of Nahan town and 12 adjoining villages due to the dispute which began around 45 years ago due to some flaws in settlement.

 Bindal said this matter had been raised many times with the state and Union governments. He said following his talk with former defence minister Manohar Parikar, the Union government had informed the Himachal government through a communiqu√© that if it transferred an equal measure of land to the Army as had been encroached by the locals, the matter could be resolved. He told the Union minister the dispute had led to delay in work on 5km long road between Banog and Jabal Ka Baag under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. 
 
 Sitharaman has assured Bindal that all efforts would be made to settle this issue permanently.
 
 According to sources, the state government had transferred 185.70.11 hectare land to Army in   and Majholi village (116.56.85 and 69.13.26 hectares respectively) in 1979. However, the Army has possession of 113.38.17 hectare land only. Out of the remaining 72.31.94 hectares, 3.18.68 hectare land is in possession of civilians, who have had their houses, lawns and paths on it since generations. Army has still not occupied 69.13.26 hectare of land in Majholi.
