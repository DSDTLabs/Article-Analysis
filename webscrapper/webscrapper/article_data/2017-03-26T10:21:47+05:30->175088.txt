IMPHAL: The BJP-led coalition government in  , which ended the United Naga Council's four-month-long blockade of the state's national highways, now has two general strikes on its hands. 

 The Democratic Students' Alliance of Manipur has called a 17-hour strike from midnight on Saturday in protest against induction of Independent MLA Ashab Uddin as parliamentary secretary. The group describes Ashab as 'non-indigenous'.
 
 On the other hand, the Manipur Muslim Welfare Association imposed a 24-hour strike from 6pm on Saturday to support its demand for a white paper on the Centre's deal with   (I-M). The association also urged the state government to pass bills to check inflow of illegal migrants in the state.
 
 Faced with the twin bandhs, chief secretary Oinam Nabakishore   urged the concerned groups to call off their respective protests in public interest. A government statement signed by Singh also appealed to all service providers, including transporters, shop-owners and other establishments, to continue to work.
 
 "The state machinery will provide necessary security to all establishments during the bandh," the statement said.
 
 Taking serious note of Muivah's claim that Naga integration was included in the Centre-NSCN (I-M) framework agreement, state   vice-president and MLA Y   said the pact should be made public.
