HYDERABAD: It was the day of the underdogs as unfancied Dabang Delhi turned the tables on former champions and last season runners-up   with a shock 30-26 win on Day-2 of the   Season-5 at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Saturday.

 The team from the capital should be thankful to their experienced duo of Nilesh Shinde and Bajirao Hodage, who combined to defend the raiding machines of the Panthers, whose top players have a tally of over 800 points in the   so far. “Our defence is the best in the   this season. This is just the beginning,” said Dabang Delhi coach   after the match, sounding a warning to the rival teams.
 
 Jaipur had only themselves to blame for the defeat as they enjoyed a 10-point lead at 11-4 in the first-half.
