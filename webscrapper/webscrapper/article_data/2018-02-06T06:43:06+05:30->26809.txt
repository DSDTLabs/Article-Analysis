The condition is estimated to affect 1 in 10,000-30,000 newborns and is a rare group of "congenital human brain malformations".

 A division bench of Justices   and   allowed the woman to abort the foetus at her own risk. “The neurologist has reported that the condition affecting the foetus has high mortality... and... the risk of termination of pregnancy is not going to be more than of normal labour,” the judges said.

 The woman found that the foetus suffered from the syndrome in her 22nd week of pregnancy. “Even if the baby is allowed to be born, in all probability it is not likely to survive or have a normal life span or quality,” she said in her petition. Under section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 20 weeks is the outer limit prescribed for an abortion. But there are exceptions, especially if the mother's life is in danger. The rules allow pregnancy to be terminated within 20 weeks if it is feared that the child would go on to suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped if allowed to be born. The court said the rule could be considered for a pregnant woman even beyond 20 weeks.
 
 The woman, on the order of the court, appeared before the medical board of the Sir JJ Group of Hospitals. The board confirmed that the foetus suffered from Dandy Walker Syndrome, along with other complications, and there was high risk of mortality.
