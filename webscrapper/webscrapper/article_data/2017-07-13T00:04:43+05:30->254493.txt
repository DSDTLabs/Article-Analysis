Thiruvananthapuram: In the get-together of fish workers held as part of Matsyotsavam at Tagore Theatre on Wednesday, fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma said that those who were registered under the Kerala Fishermen’s Welfare Fund Board will get BPL ration cards.

 The three-day festival was organized by Matsyafed. Around 1,000 fish workers participated in the Matsya Adalat that was held as part of the event. Majority of the complaints in the adalat were about the APL status in ration cards
 
 Civil supplies minister P Thilothaman has assured that the fishermen who have registered under the welfare fund board will be included in the BPL list. “We were able to solve certain issues that were raised in the adalat and the remaining requests will be considered in course of time. The fish workers who obtained loans on or before 2008 will be included in the debt relief policy of the state government. We will recommend the central government to provide financial aid packages for the fish workers who took loans after 2008. The housing construction scheme for the fish workers will be completed within the tenure of this government,” the minister said.
 
 Managing director of Matsyafed Lawrance Harold said, “The festival has been successful with the participation of fish workers and also through the implementation of favourable actions through the Matsya adalat. The suggestions that were raised during the festival and the new knowledge that were imparted to the community are mutually beneficial for the fish workers as well as for the fisheries department”.
 
 Neyyatinkara MLA K Ansalan presided over the function. District panchayat president V K Madhu delivered the key note address. Distribution of financial aid for fish workers was conducted by A Sampath MP.
