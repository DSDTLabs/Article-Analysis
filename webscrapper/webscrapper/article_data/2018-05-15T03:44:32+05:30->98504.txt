MUMBAI: Almost four years after the   admitted 99,437 applications from hawkers during a ten-day registration drive, a preliminary scrutiny by the civic body has found only 23,265 — or nearly 25% — of the applicants eligible, though 2,782 forms are still to be scrutinized, said officials. 

 The BMC has marked around 85,000 hawking pitches in the city after enactment of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood & Regulation of Street Vending) Act of 2014. But officials indicated not all pitches need to be filled up. 
 
 The BMC started its hawker registration drive on July 18, 2014. It distributed more than 1.25 lakh forms across the city. In all, 99,000-plus applications turned out to be successful. Recently, a detailed scrutiny was done by staff from the office of superintendent of the licence department. 
 
 There are criteria that hawkers need to meet in order to be eligible, said officials. A hawker is required to be an Indian national, should have completed the age of 14 years at the time of the survey, and should have proof of vending prior to May 1, 2014. 
 
 “During the registration drive we had not sought   , but for final registration it will be considered,” said  , superintendent of the licence department. Thus, for final registration, a hawker will have to have a   domicile certificate and submit an undertaking that the business is being carried on by him and that he/she has no other means of livelihood. 
 
 The hawker should also not transfer rent, certificate of vending or the place specified therein to any other person. But all is not lost for those found ineligible. 
 
 “We are planning to write back to these applicants and ask them if they have any submissions to make,” said Bande. 
 
 These hawkers will have to reply in 30 days. Dayashankar Singh of   said BMC is in no mood to implement the policy in totality.
