KOLKATA: After failing to repay a bank  ,   (46), a defence ministry employee, tried to commit suicide by setting himself ablaze in front of bank officials and cops during a raid on his residence at Ichhapore on Saturday afternoon.

 Majumder was admitted to R G   with severe burns. His family members, including his wife and two sons, were evicted from the house which has been sealed by the bank officials.
 
 According to locals, Majumder, an employee of Ichhapore metal factory and a resident of Ichhapore’s   area, had taken the loan of Rs 15 lakh in 2008 from a private bank to build his house. According to bank records, he never paid any instalment in the last eight years and the outstanding amount rose to Rs 33 lakh with interest. “We issued him notice at least 17 times but he did not respond. He met the bank manager twice and assured to repay the loan but didn’t pay any amount,” a bank official said.
 
 “After sealing the house on Saturday, while the bank and police officers were about to leave, Majumder, with a kerosene container in his hand, rushed to them and blocked their way. He suddenly emptied the container on his body and set himself afire,” said a neighbour. The people standing nearby rushed to him, doused the flames and took him hospital.
