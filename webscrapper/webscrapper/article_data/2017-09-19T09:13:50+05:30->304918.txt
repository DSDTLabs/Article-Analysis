ITANAGAR:   has said the Centre has not taken any decision about citizenship for Chakma and Hajong   and any such reports are rumours.

 “I don’t know how this simple thing has not been conveyed to the people. How has the message gone that Centre is going to grant citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs Who spread this rumour Who manipulated such a campaign Rijiju said here on Sunday on the sidelines of a  .
 
 Attributing the stance on refugees to a concern for the rights of “his” people, Rijiju said, “First of all, I think about my people. I value human rights and constitutional norms, but everything will be meaningful to me if the rights of our people are protected.”
 
 The Supreme Court had in 2015 asked the Centre and the Arunachal government to grant citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs within three months. “But we did not accept it, saying that we cannot accept it at present and the rights of the indigenous people of the state should be protected first,” Rijiju said. 
 
 He added that the home ministry has asked the SC to modify the order so that rights of the indigenous people are not diluted. “We are trying to tell the court that giving Chakma and Hajong refugees the same rights as Arunachalees is not acceptable to us. So, people of the state should appreciate the fact that for the first time the Centre has not agreed to the court’s order,” he further said.
 
 “Even Aapsu has filed a case in court against the refugees. All matters now lie with the apex court. The   had passed an order stating that Inner Line Permit is not required for Chakma and Hajong refugees and they should be treated as citizens of the state. The (Union) home ministry has not accepted the decision,” Rijiju said.
 
 
 The state government is also fighting a for deletion of names of refugees from the voters’ list, Rijiju added.
