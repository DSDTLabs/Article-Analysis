 “Let the Madras high court deal with it. You (petitioner) go there. Why do you come all the way to Supreme Court,“ a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud told a petitioner advocate.
 
 Advocate N Rajaraman, who mentioned the plea before the bench, said the protestors should not be assaulted like the Ramlila Maidan incident in 2011 where supporters of Baba Ramdev were caned by police.
 
 He said the court should take suo motu cognizance of the development and provide relief to the agitators.The bench, however, asked the petitioner to approach the Madras high court for relief.
 
 The development came on a day when Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek promulgation of an ordinance to allow jallikattu amid widespread protests in the state against the ban on the sport.
 
 The apex court had reserved its verdict on December 7 last year on a batch of petitions challenging the Centre's notification allowing the sport.
 
 On the next day, the Centre had issued a notification lifting the ban on jallikattu in Tamil Nadu with certain restrictions, which was challenged in the apex court by Animal Welfare Board of India, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals India and others.
