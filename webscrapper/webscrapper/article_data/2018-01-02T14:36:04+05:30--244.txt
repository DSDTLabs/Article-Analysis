The actor has now requested folks to not spread the fake pictures on social media. “What you see going viral is not real. I will soon share the picture of the baby with you all,” Vishnu said in a statement.
 
  Ariaana and Viviaana are said to be overjoyed about the newest addition to the family. The proud parents are of course equally elated too. Seems like 2018 will be a good year for Vishnu seeing as how he has a good lineup of films like ‘Gayatri’, ‘Voter’ and ‘Achari America Yatra’.
