TRICHY: By now, Trichy   over Bridge (RoB), often called Aristo roundabout, should have been commissioned to ease the traffic congestion near the railway junction. But with   acquisition being a major reason for the delay in completing and commissioning the project, traffic snarls continue in the city. As defence minister   was here on Friday, the need for a portion of defence land in   to complete the RoB works was brought to her notice by district collector  . The minister, on hearing the requirements, was said to have promised to do the needful at the earliest.

 With six arms, the Trichy junction RoB was designed to be established at an estimated cost of Rs 81.40 crore to enable vehicles heading to other districts to bypass the city. They could thereby avoid frequent traffic congestion near Dindigul road and Madurai road. However, the persistent issues on acquiring land involving various state and central government agencies including defence and railways has been affecting the overall progress of construction works.
 
 Except for the Chennai arm of the RoB that awaits 0.66 acre of defence land to complete the high level road, works in all other arms had been completed while two arms were opened for traffic. “The district administration reiterated our request to defence minister to provide the defence land for completing the Chennai arm works in Trichy junction RoB. The union minister was informed about the project and she assured to do the needful at the earliest,” district collector K Rajamani told TOI. The process of sanctioning the defence land to the state government for completing the RoB works was said to be in the final stage.
 
 Highways department sources said that if the defence land was acquired, the remaining construction works in Chennai arm could be completed in three months and the bridge commissioned for public use. The equivalent monetary value of the 0.66 acre of defence land was estimated at Rs 5.77 crore.
