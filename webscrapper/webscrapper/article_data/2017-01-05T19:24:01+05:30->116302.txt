PANAJI/MARGAO: Chief electoral officer Kunal said on Thursday that flying squads have been formed to respond to complaints of violations of the election code of conduct. “The response time for the flying squad is five minutes,” he said, after the election commission declared the election schedule of five states.

 With February 4 being announced as the date for the assembly elections, Kunal said the code of conduct has now come into force. 
 
 Complaints, he said, can be made on their toll-free number as well as their Facebook page.
 
 Kunal said all government departments have been issued guidelines asking them not to undertake major works. If there is work which needs to be carried out as an emergency, Kunal said they will have to take clearance from the election commission. 
 
 He said defacement of public property will not be tolerated. Any posters and banners put up by political parties in public spaces will be ordered to be removed within 24 hours. 
 
 To stop the play of money power, Kunal said, the commercial tax department has been keeping tabs on consumer goods’ vendors to check if the sales are exceptionally high.
 
 Vendors of vegetable, milk, fish and distributors of newspapers will be on their radar to check that they are not being used to reach out to voters during the last two days before the elections. 
 
 The   district administration has geared up its machinery for the assembly polls as well. Addressing a joint press conference on Wednesday, South Goa collector, Swapnil Naik said, “In South Goa, there will be 42 flying squads, two each in every constituency, headed by an executive magistrate, which will remain operational 24 hours. Three teams have been constituted for each squad which will work in eight-hour shifts. Besides, 13 static surveillance squads will be stationed at strategic locations,” Naik said.
