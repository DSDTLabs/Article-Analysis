AHMEDABAD: Even as multiplexes across Gujarat voluntarily decided not to screen the film Padmaavat, which released nationwide on Thursday, most multiplexes in Ahmedabad kept their premises shut, with fear of violence looming large. It may be noted that   (SRRKS) had called for a nationwide bandh on Thursday in the wake of the film’s release.

 Most multiplexes voluntarily downed their shutters to avoid any controversy. “We’ve kept the multiplex shut today and tomorrow onwards, we’ll begin business as usual. The decision to not release Padmaavat stands,” said  , president,   (GMA) and owner, Wide Angle Multiplex on SG Road.
 
 Some others who kept their premises open were forced to cancel movie shows at least in the morning, as audiences stayed away, despite heavy security cover. “Even though the mall and multiplex were kept open amid a tight security cover, the footfall was minimum and the cinema hall was forced to cancel shows in the morning,” said Jayen Naik, of Ahmedabad One Mall.
 
 Overall, turnout was low across all the malls. “We opened the mall after 2pm and the multiplex also began shows around the same time. However, the turnout was much lower than what we expect even on a weekday. From Friday onwards, we anticipate that custom will be back to normal,” said Aditya Shah, CFO, Gulmohar Park Mall.
 
 Meanwhile, impact of the bandh was hardly visible as most commercial establishments and major markets operated as usual, except for Bapunagar diamond market which was closed. MoS home and law,  , said, “There was not a single incident of violence reported. State police is taking all necessary action to maintain law and order. The chief minister’s public events in Visnagar and  , too, saw huge public participation.”
