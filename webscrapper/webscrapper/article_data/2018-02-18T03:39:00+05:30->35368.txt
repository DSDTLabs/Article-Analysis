Vijayawada: Railway officials, who were worried about the slow speed of their   network, found that most users were downloading  , affecting the bandwidth badly. While the network is genuinely slow, downloading of pornographic content worsens the problem. “We are working to provide a much efficient bandwidth,” the DRM told TOI.

 Interestingly, viewing porn using free Wi-Fi provided by the government is not something new, and limited to the Vijayawada railway division alone. 
 
 Railway officials said it is common across various stations and added that no steps are being taken to restrict websites offering pornography. They say it is not their business to interfere in somebody’s private space. According to studies, only 4% websites in the world offer sex-related content, but the traffic generated by them is above 20%.
 
 RailTel, which provides Internet services as RailWire via its extensive fiber network along with Google, launched the Wi-Fi services in April 2016.
 
 Officials said the Wi-Fi services at the station benefits over two lakh people a day. Nevertheless, a casual speed test revealed that speed is only around 1 mbps. The service built over the fiber network of RailTel is designed to offer high-speed broadband experience to users.
 
 It is intended to allow travellers passing through these stations to easily stream high-definition videos, research their destination, download a book, or a new game. The DRM said that few other stations within Vijayawada division will soon have free Wi-Fi service. Free Wi-Fi network at public places is no longer a rare thing, and is seen as sign of technological and socio-economic advancement. However, like all things good, the free Wi-Fi service is throwing up some unintended and undesired results.
