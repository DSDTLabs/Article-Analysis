MUMBAI: Disgraced former   czar   has hit out at the   a day after TOI reported how the official Board website,  , owned by Modi, had gone offline last weekend after the domain was not renewed in time.

 Modi’s counsel,   issued a statement on Monday. “Despite having been treated so unjustly by BCCI Lalit Modi still keeps the domains alive and functional for the good of cricket and its administration,” Abdi’s statement read.
 
 “Modi reinvented the BCCI in many ways. Digitalization was one such sphere. While the then the mindset of the BCCI functionaries was archaic vis-à-vis latest IPR avenues like domain names etc, Modi himself took the initiative and got host of domain names registered by him. Bcci.tv is one such domain name.”
 
 Abdi claimed that the domain couldn’t be renewed in time due to ‘payment gateway issue.’ “The domain was on auto renewal. 
 
 Whereas, there was some payment gateway issue which has been resolved and the website is operational. 
 
 The BCCI should have been proactive to get this domain renewed well in time so as to avoid the glitch. Many domain names are relating to cricket are owned by Modi and some of them are subjudice. Modi takes care of their updation and upkeep,” said Abdi. Modi was banned by the BCCI since 2010 and forced to live in exile in London after a series of financial misappropriation accusations
