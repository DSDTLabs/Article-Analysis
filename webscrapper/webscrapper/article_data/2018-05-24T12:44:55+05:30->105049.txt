NAGPUR: In a first-of-its-kind move, the district administration has directed the city police to take stern action against those who use animals for transportation during peak heat.

 Following a complaint by animal activist  , the district collector   recently wrote to the commissioner of police  , stating that the central government’s Prevention of Cruelty to Draught and Pack Animals Rules, 1965, should be implemented in full force.
 
 As per the rules, no person is allowed to use any animal for carrying load or drawing vehicle between 12 and 3pm in areas where temperature exceeds 37 degree Celsius. 
 
 In the letter, Mudgal further stated that animals won’t be made to lug around any material for more than nine hours in a day and for more than five hours continuously without a break or rest.
 
 “If these rules are violated, the police should take action as per the relevant sections of the act,” the letter stated. As reported by TOI recently, cops registered offences against two people who were using bulls to transport timber around ten days back.
 
 The men were using bullocks to transport timber near   at 1.30pm, when the city’s maximum temperature was 44.5 degree Celsius. 
 
 With heatwave grappling the region, activists are demanding strict implementation of these rules. On Wednesday too, the The Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, issued a warning for heatwave in the region. As per the warning, heatwave is likely to prevail over some parts of Vidarbha and severe heatwave in one or two pockets from May 22-26. 
 
 On Wednesday, Akola was the hottest in the region with a maximum temperature of 43.7 degree Celsius. It was followed by Chandrapur which recorded a maximum temperature of 43.6 degree Celsius. 
 
 The maximum temperature recorded in Nagpur was 43 degree Celsius. As per the predictions, the maximum temperatures are expected to be on a higher side in the coming days. Citizens are advised to stay indoors during afternoon hours.
