BENGALURU: Mining baron and former minister Gali Janardhana Reddy has been allowed by the Supreme Court to visit his hometown Ballari for three days to take party in Dasara celebrations.

 Reddy can be in Ballari from September 29 to October 1. Reddy, arrested by the CBI in connection with illegal mining cases, was released on bail in January 2015. One of the conditions was that he would not step into Ballari, Anantapur and Cuddapah where he had his businesses.
 
 After denying him permission several times, the Supreme Court relented and permitted Reddy to stay in Ballari for three days. The court had on September 4 dismissed a similar plea to enter Ballari while refusing to relax the bail conditions.
