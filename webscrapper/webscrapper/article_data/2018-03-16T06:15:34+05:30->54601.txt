KOLKATA: Bengal government is all set to start its first nonscheduled flight under the regional connectivity scheme this month with a private nonscheduled operator winning the bid to connect three or more destinations in Bengal.

 Bengal will be the first among states to reap the benefit of the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) announced by the   offering to share the burden of viability gap funding (VGF).
 
 If Bengal’s scheme fits into the RCS policy, viability gap funding will be shared between Centre and state in a 80:20 ratio. Under RCS, the standard fare was kept at Rs 2500.
 
 According to senior government officer, Heritage Aviation, a helicopter and aircraft charter company based in New Delhi, has won the bid to operate the non-scheduled flight with a ten-seater fixed wing aircraft, which will be brought to Kolkata shortly.
 
 The state has set a minimum utilization hour at 75 hours a month. If the aircraft develops any snag within that period, it needs to be replaced by the operator.
 
 When operated in the predefined routes, the operator must sell seats to public at an indicative price set by the transport department. “We want to fly the aircraft among the airports that are under direct control of the Bengal government such as like Coochbehar, Malda, Balurghat, and  . Besides that, the aircraft can also use Kolkata, Andal and Bagdorga.
 
 Bengal has 34 listed airports and airstrips but less than a dozen are considered viable. Many of them, including Behala and Malda, have encroachments along the flight funnel. These two airports, along with Balurghat, could make the scheme when the second phase is announced.
