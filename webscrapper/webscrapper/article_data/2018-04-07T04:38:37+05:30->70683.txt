MUMBAI: At least five   students from a central  , who had initially passed their exams, were declared failed in a subject when they applied for revaluation with a hope to improve their scores. 

 Having originally cleared the ' ' (CRM) paper, the students did not even register for the repeaters' exam that begins on Tuesday. The students from  , who have been above-average performers in all the previous exams, seemed to be the first set of victims for this season's revaluation goof-up. The affected students approached their college's BMS coordinator with their plaint on Friday, when the revaluation results were declared. When TOI contacted a student from the college said almost all the affected students usually have had 'O' and 'A' grades in their exams. "The differences in scores now are between 20-40%. They are unable to concentrate on their final exams, which are slated to commence in the next 15 days. The marks of some other students from the college too have reduced after revaluation, but they have at least passed. It is really unfair for them," the student said. One of the students, who had originally scored 47 in CRM in the results declared on February 23, has scored 25 after re-valuation now. A principal said that the university allows second revaluation only in exceptional cases and that too with the vice-chancellor's assent. "Since the repeaters' exam is scheduled in the next three days, there is no scope for them to reappear. The university will have to consider them as special cases. It is just unfortunate," said the principal. 
 
 Examination section's representative,  , said that the students will have to approach the university with their grievances on Saturday they will look into the matter. The university has till now received 17,000 applications for revaluation for the exams conducted in November-December 2017.
