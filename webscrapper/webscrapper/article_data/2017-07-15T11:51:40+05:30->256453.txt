 has been receiving flak for two or more reasons in the last three days. Now the Viswaroopam actor has said he will apologise after being under tremendous pressure for mentioning the name of the actress who is a sexual assault victim in a press meet recently.

 Kamal had convened a press conference recently to answer to the controversies relating to the ongoing TV show Bigg Boss Tamil.   being the host of the show which involves celebrities living in a house with rules and regulations, was answering the press people to the questions related to the show.
 
 When a reporter asked the actor-director about the safety of   in the film industry after the sexual assault case of a Malayalam actor, he had replied “Why is it the safety of women in the film industry alone? A female’s presence in the crowd is important to me and I will not let anything happen to her. It’s our duty to see if you are safe. It is not just about actresses. We are not supporting her (mentions the name), because she is an actress.”
 
 When pointed out that the name of the victim shouldn’t be named he had argued that there is nothing wrong in that. After the actor’s statement   chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam has sent a notice to Kamal demanding an apology for publicly naming the victim.
 
 Now Kamal has replied to the notice in a series of tweets and by eventually saying he will apologise. His series of tweets said, “Apologize say women, while I love & fight 4them. I will bend 2 no woman or man 4 no reason. U r penalizing the lawyer & missing criminals.”
