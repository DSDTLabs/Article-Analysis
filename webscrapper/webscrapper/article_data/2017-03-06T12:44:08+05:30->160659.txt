Imran Khan, who was last seen in  's 2015 romantic-drama ' ' is all set to turn director. Mirror has learnt that the 34-year-old actor is currently penning a script with   who has earlier written films like the Sidharth Malhotra-Alia Bhatt-Fawad Khan starrer 'Kapoor & Sons' and 'Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu' with Imran and  . The duo has also been friends since 20 years and their minds are completely in sync.

  
  
 "It's a character drama revolving around several people and their lives. It's still being developed. Imran is extremely excited about the project and completely focussed on it," says a source close to the actor. Buzz is, several A-list actresses have shown interest in it. The source, however, insists that Imran who will not be acting in his directorial debut because he wants to concentrate on one thing at a time - will only begin casting after he has locked the script. The film isn't expected to roll this year.
 
 Meanwhile, he's on a self-imposed hibernation as far as acting is concerned. While speaking to Mirror (August 10, 2015) earlier he had said that it's important for him to like the script and the director since he will be spending six to eight months working on a film. "I ask myself if I'd watch the film and be entertained by it. If the answer is 'yes', then maybe it's a 'yes' from me too," he had said.
