KOTTAYAM: The Kerala Technological University’s (KTU) move to conduct a second inspection at the   in   near here sparked protests on Tuesday. The panel from the KTU, which had visited the campus earlier, had recommended the closure of the college. What infuriated the students unions, especially the ABVP, was the move by the panel to begin the inspection from the hostel building. The college authorities allegedly tried to “dress up” the hostel building and pass off it as part of the academic block. 

 Following stiff resistance from the students, the panel, headed by G P  , the registrar of the university, dropped the plan to inspect the hostel building and returned to the old college building. By the time a contingent of police personnel also reached the campus.
 
 Meanwhile, Padmakumar said that he will submit a report to the government on Thursday. He also said the majority of students who appeared before the panel had expressed their wish to continue their studies in other colleges. Among the 210 students, 198 of them said so, he said.
 
 The panel recorded the statements of students and their parents. Meanwhile, the students alleged that the inspection was a farce as the same questions asked in the first sitting were repeated.
 
 The hostel and a building which are under construction was modified to appear as part of the academic block of the college. The students alleged that the move was to safeguard the affiliation of the college to the KTU by showing that the college has sufficient facilities. The facilities were video recorded by the cameraman who accompanied the panel. 
 
 The students' unions alleged that the move by the college management was to obtain a clean chit to reopen the college. The students were earlier issued notice that the college will reopen on February 2. The college chairman Tom P Joseph did not turn up on Tuesday also.
