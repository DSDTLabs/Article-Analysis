The tri-cycles are adding to the traffic woes of Madurai as the slow moving vehicles often clog narrow stretches in the busy city which is yet to find a solution to the congestion it has been facing for long. The haphazard parking of the tricycles also leaves the bikers high and dry, as it takes the parking space of at least five bikes.

 It is high time the city police to streamline them and bring about a solution without affecting the livelihood of the tricycle pullers, opine police officers. “Violating traffic rules on one-way stretches has become a norm for the tricycle pullers. They do not take circuitous routes because of obvious reason,” said a traffic police official.
 
 Another police officer said the slow moving vehicles play spoil sport when the city police tried to introduce ‘green-corridor’ in 2015. The green corridor would enable a vehicle to pass through an entire stretch consisting of multiple signals in one go. The slow moving vehicles caused bottleneck, propelled them shelving the plan, he said.
 
 The trading community opined that the issue would mitigate when the markets are shifted to the new facility. An official in the police department said it is planning to bring down the numbers gradually in a few years. However, it would be done without affecting the livelihood of the vehicle pullers by ensuring rehabilitation. But police alone cannot do it. Other agencies like civic body and labour department can help solve the issue. As of now they can be streamlined to an extent by barring them from congested roads. But again, it would be done without affecting their livelihood much, he added.
