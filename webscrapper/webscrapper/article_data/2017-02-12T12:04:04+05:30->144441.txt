PANAJI: Facing a   and unable to foot the Rs 3.12 crore   for the municipal market complex, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) now wants the state government to come to its rescue. 

 With less than five days to go to cough up the money to pay the outstanding dues, CCP mayor Surendra Furtado has written to CCP commissioner   asking him to petition the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) for Rs 20 crore as grant-in-aid.
 
 Furtado has also sought disciplinary action against an unnamed accounts department official who failed to follow up with an earlier proposal that was to be sent to DMA for grants. In the letter sent to Dessai, Furtado sought a probe into the inaction of the accounts section for “not submitting a proposal for grants-in-aid on time.”
 
 “Had the proposal for government grants been sent to the DMA in November 2016, based on the resolution taken by the council, the government might have sanctioned the grant amount and the corporation would have been able to pay the electricity dues to the power department,” Furtado said.
 
 Given that the power bill has accumulated since October 2015, it has reached a point where the dues are straining CCP’s financial capability, Furtado indicated. Furtado insists that a resolution was taken in November 2016 to seek government grants but the proposal was not sent to the DMA.
