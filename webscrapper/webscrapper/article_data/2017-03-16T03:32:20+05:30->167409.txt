 Explaining its reasons for the tabling the bill, the state said the double   was passed on to home-owners by unscrupulous builders. “It has been observ-ed that some unscrupulous el-ements after constructing the building unlawfully, sell flats to buyers who purchase them under the belief that such construction is authorized,” the bill said. “Since the amount of penalty is recovered as arrears of property tax, buyers have to pay the penalty though it is not their fault.” —Priyanka Kakodkar
