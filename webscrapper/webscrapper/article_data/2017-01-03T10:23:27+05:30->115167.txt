MUMBAI: The Supreme Court's decision to crack the whip on a defiant   for refusing to implement the   reforms may finally force a clearly rattled Mumbai Cricket Association ( ), which has so far staunchly resisted them, to fall in line too.

 After becoming the first state unit to announce that it will implement the Lodha Committee reforms post SC's July 18 order, MCA did a 'U-turn' when it challenged them in the SC. In a Special General Meeting (SGM), the association even rejected one of the key recommendations, which allowed for only one vote from one state in the Board elections.
 
 However, the resignation of its president  , who was ineligible to continue primarily because is 75 years of age and is thus disqualified (reforms stipulate that administrators must not be above 70), in December, and Monday's developments may now force MCA, and the other associations, to implement reforms. “Do we have a choice? We will now call for a managing committee meeting, then an SGM, and amend the constitution. Almost all of us have to quit now, because we're ineligible on one grounds or another,” a MCA official told TOI on Monday. There was speculation that Pawar's resignation will be rejected by the MCA's managing committee, but that looks unlikely following the SC's strong order on Monday.
 
 “It's indeed sad that a wonderful administrator like Pawar has to go. He ensured that we got the land at the BKC for our ground and the indoor academy for merely Rs2.65 crore. Today, the value of that land is around Rs 1,500 crore. It was so easy to get work done with him at the helm. The lease for the Wankhede Stadium is coming up for renewal next year, and it would've been far smoother to manage that issue if he was around,” rued an MCA official.
 
 Implementation of reforms will also see the exit of former batsman Dilip Vengsarkar since he has been a MCA Vice-President for nine years now.
