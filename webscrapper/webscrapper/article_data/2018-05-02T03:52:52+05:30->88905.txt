NEW DELHI:   MPs will attend ‘Kisan Kalyan Karyashala’ on Wednesday, organised by the Centre at the block level across the country as part of the ongoing ‘Gram  .’ 

 
 The campaign is seen as the ruling BJP’s effort to connect with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, besides youth and farmers, by highlighting and expanding several welfare initiatives of the   dispensation. 
 
 The campaign started on April 14, the birth anniversary of Dalit icon B R Ambedkar, and will continue till May 5. Sources said Agriculture Minister   had written to all MPs, asking them to attend the workshops. However, it had no takers among opposition MPs, which often accused the government of politicising such events.
