NEW DELHI:   vice-president   thanked minister for external affairs   for acknowledging the contribution of various Congress governments in building the nation.

 In an apparent bid to drive a wedge between Swaraj and Prime Minister Narendra  , Rahul tweeted, “Sushmaji, thank you for finally recognising Congress governments’ great vision and legacy of setting up IITs and IIMs.”
 
  
  
 
 In her address at the UN general assembly on Saturday, Swaraj complimented previous governments, including those of the Congress, for helping to build India.
 
 She also showcased the demonetisation drive and introduction of goods and services tax (GST) as successes of the Modis government.
 
 The minister said, “There have been many governments under many parties during 70 years of Indian freedom for we have been a sustained democracy. Every government has done its bit for India’s development." Modi hailed Swaraj for her speech, saying she delivered a strong message on the dangers of terrorism.
 
 In a series of tweets, Modi said, “A strong message was given by Sushma Swaraj ji on the dangers of terrorism and why we have to unite and fight this menace.” 
 
 In her speech, Swaraj asked Pakistani leaders to introspect as to why India was recognised as a global IT superpower while the neighbour was infamous as the “pre-eminent export factory for terror”.
