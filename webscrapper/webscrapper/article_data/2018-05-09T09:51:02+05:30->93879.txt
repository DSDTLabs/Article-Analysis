CHENNAI: A   tournament for top   officials in   last July has played spoilsport for Southern Railway’s athletes, with their daily allowance of Rs 150 during monthly camps having been stopped for almost a year. Officials in the zonal railway said the   Sports Association ( ) was facing a fund crunch as it overshot the budget earmarked for the tournament.

 Coaches and sportspersons told TOI that this had led to a cut of up to Rs 40,000 for teams in various sports, affecting the morale of players. Every player is eligible for the daily allowance for a maximum of 30 days. “Due to the cut, experienced players have stopped coming for practice and camps,” rued the coach of a team. Weightlifters and bodybuilders who have to spend a considerable amount on nutrition are now hard-pressed for funds, added a sportsperson. 
 
 SRSA secretary and chief planning and development engineer   told TOI that the allowance was increased three years ago, but he was not aware of the cut. “If they are not getting it, we will pull up the welfare inspectors,” he said. 
 
 Officials said the budget allocated for the golf tournament was around Rs 15 lakh but the total amount spent was more than Rs 18 lakh. “Of this, 75% was spent for accommodation for 200 people, all of whom are top officers in Indian Railways. Many of them brought their families along as it was held in Kodaikanal. One officer even brought a bungalow peon who demanded a separate room,” said an official involved in organising the event. The accommodation was provided in three hotels and many retired officers also took part, the official said. Another official involved in the sports department said SRSA is already hard-pressed for funds since the allocation has been decreasing. The   gives a grant of Rs 20-25 lakh every year. “Unlike Integral Coach Factory, SR does not have infrastructure of its own like high-quality grounds. There has been no fund generation for this reason,” the official said.
