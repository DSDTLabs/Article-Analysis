KOLKATA: Within hours of a   being lifted at  , another started on the   campus, a stone’s throw away, on College Street.

 On Tuesday, registrar   and other officebearers were allowed to go home after 24 hours by students who held them captive in the name of “demonstration” since Monday evening. Immediately after the gherao ended, another student protest started in CU, this time over allegations of nepotism in the Bengali MPhil selection test.
 
 The CU demonstration stopped V-C Ashutosh Ghosh from leaving the campus. “The agitation was mostly by Bengali MPhil applicants who claimed candidates selected on the merit list got there thanks to their alleged closeness to a department teacher,” said a source.
