This year's Academy awards nominations are ditching the traditional live audience by going online. 

 Contenders for the 89th Academy Awards will be revealed via a live, global stream, but without the traditional live audience, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said. 
 
 Nominations will be hard to miss, as they will be LIVE on Oscar.com, Oscars.org, the Academys digital platforms, a satellite feed, ABC s Good Morning America, and local broadcasts. 
 
 This year's nominees for the 24 categories will be announced by Jennifer Hudson, Brie Larson, Emmanuel Lubezki, Jason Reitman, Ken Watanabe, and Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs on January 24. 
 
 The award ceremony, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will air on February 26.
