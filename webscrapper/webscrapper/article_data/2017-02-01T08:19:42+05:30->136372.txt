ETAWAH: When   arrived at the Collectorate here in a white Audi Q7 sporting an SP flag, vehicles accompanying him carried his and party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s posters. However, photographs of SP national president Akhilesh Yadav were missing. Shivpal, who filed his nomination for Jaswantnagar seat in the Yadav bastion, was accompanied by Abhay Ram, his elder brother and father of Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav, Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap, and brother-in-law Ajant Singh

 When asked about his name missing from star campaigners’ list, Shivpal Yadav said that if invited, he would definitely campaign for the party candidates in the Assembly elections. “If party would invite me, I will canvass for candidates and if not I will campaign for those candidates, who are being denied tickets by the party leadership," he said without showing any sign of remorse.
 
 He clarified that he would not campaign for those who had joined rival parties -- BSP, BJP or Congress. 
 
 All the ‘disgruntled’ SP workers were invited by Shivpal at his nomination. Etawah Sadar MLA   and sitting MLA Sukhdevi Verma from Bharthana (reserved), who have been denied SP ticket, were found sitting next to Shivpal Yadav. Former ministers Amarjeet Chaudhary, Ashok Bajpayi and Rajpal Yadav were also present with the former state SP president.
