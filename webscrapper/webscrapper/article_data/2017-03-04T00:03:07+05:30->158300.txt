Gurgaon: After the Delhi-Jaipur side of the   at   on the Gurgaon-Jaipur expressway, work on the   to   side has gathered pace. And if   is able to make available land that is currently occupied by a restaurant and a wine shop, this   could see completion by   — ie, within the stipulated 30 months since work started.

 The two commercial establishments on the service lane of the Hero Honda Chowk occupy an area of 850 square metres. There was a dispute between the restaurant owners and Huda on acquisition of land for the flyover project at the busy intersection, which was the root cause of the massive traffic 20-hour gridlock in the city in July last year.
 
 Huda and NHAI officials met the owners of the restaurant and the wine shop on Thursday evening and tried to convince them to vacate the land. “We have asked them to give us the land for the flyover project. But the owners said they need some time to discuss it among themselves. A meeting is scheduled for Friday when we will finally decide on the issue,” said Yashpal Yadav, Huda administrator.
 
 In order to decongest the Hero Honda Chowk, NHAI and the Haryana government had approved a three-level crossing at the intersection — an eight-lane flyover on the expressway and a four-lane underpass on Old Gurgaon Road while the existing road to be exclusively used by vehicles coming from the Delhi side that want to turn into Old Gurgaon Road. There will also be slip lanes for U-turns and right turns.
 
 The construction of the Rs 139 crore project began in February 2015, with completion time of 30 months. But the project slowed down due to delay in clearance of the land required. The Delhi-Jaipur side of the flyover at Hero Honda Chowk is likely to be thrown open to traffic this month-end.
