THRISSUR: The education department is planning to file a caveat petition at the high court and other judicial bodies to reduce the flow of appeals at the   next year.

 Education minister C   said petitions will be filed before the courts with a request to hear the government’s version before pronouncing an order on appeals filed by various contestants.
 
 “Right now, we are not heard when appeals are sanctioned by the courts, and we get caught unawares by the spate of appeals, which in turn derails our schedule,” the minister said.
 
 When asked about the complaints that judges are giving ‘A’ grades liberally to contestants, he said: “We had actually enhanced the marks required to secure ‘A’ grade from 70% to 80% this time. Now, judges have to ensure that they select only those meet the set standards. We will try to identify judges early next time and give them an orientation.”
 
 However, he and director of public instructions (DPI) KV Mohankumar disclosed that several eminent personalities like Manju Bhargavi, Bharathi Sivaji, Ramesh Narayan, Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri, and Mattannur Sankarankutty were judges at various stages.
 
 Only judge   was exempted from the panel following complaints that he had concealed the information that he was among the judges for the district-level competitions in  , the DPI said.
 
 The minister said government favoured a thorough probe in the forged appeals case. Crime branch has launched a probe, he said.
