PANAJI: With small parties holding the key to government formation in the event of a hung assembly, the   (GFP) on Tuesday said it would support a dispensation that would protect the interest of Goans.

 “We are for the formation of a ‘Goenkarwadi sarkar’ (government for Goans),” party mentor  , said.
 
 Stating that the GFP hasn’t yet taken any decision on whom to support if there is no clear mandate, Sardesai said the party would meet on Thursday to reassess the political situation and decide their future course on the possible scenarios.
 
 “We are clear on one agenda: our need to contribute for a ‘Goenkarponn sarkar’, a government that will protect the interest of Goa and Goans,” Sardesai said, claiming that the sons of the soil have been getting marginalized.
 
 Certain that it will be a hung assembly, the GFP mentor nevertheless said it remained to be seen what mandate the two national partiesBJP and Congressreceived, in order for the regional party to deliberate on its role in government formation. 
 
 When asked about the conditions the GFP would lay down to be part of a pro-Goenkar government, Sardesai said they would be listed in a common minimum programme. 
 
 “The policies of both the national parties has led to the dilution of   in the past. It’s time we work towards empowering sons of the soil,” he said.
