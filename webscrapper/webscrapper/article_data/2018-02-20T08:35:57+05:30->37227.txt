HYDERABAD:  's population - in the next 50-60 years - could witness a steep drop in count, courtesy the dwindling fertility levels of the state. While as per globally accepted standards, the replacement level fertility (RLF) of a state should be stable at 2.1 children per woman, the figure, in the case of Telangana, is a poor 1.8. This was revealed in the recently released National Family Health Survey (NDHS-4). 

 The RLF is the fertility level required to keep the population the same from generation to generation, and is estimated with the number of births necessary to replace the loss caused due to death. 
  
  
 "Fertility in urban areas at 1.7 children per woman is lower than in rural areas by 0.2 children per woman," read the report, thus raising an alarm, among experts, about an imbalance in the state's population in the long-run.
 
 Explaining this further, Prof Satyapriya Rout from the department of sociology,   said: "While it might not be a cause for immediate concern, in the long run the overall population will begin to reduce and can have several implications - like a huge ageing population." 
 
 Experts also stressed the problem of infertility being on the rise, especially in urban areas. "We are seeing a constant increase in infertility due to various reasons like late marriages, increasing incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), consumption of junk food, obesity and even endometeriosis," said Dr Prameela Shekar, consultant gynaecologist, Apollo Hospitals (Jubilee Hills).
 
 An while the   in the state, as per the NFHS report, isn't dictated by religion, caste or tribe, education plays a vital role. "It does vary with the level of schooling. Women with no schooling have 2.2 children per woman, while women with 12 or more years of schooling have 1.8 children per woman," the report stated.
