GANDHINAGAR:  , political secretary to   president   and   MP, while speaking in the Rajya Sabha during the thanksgiving motion to the President’s address raised the issues of Gujarat’s farmers, dalits and disabled persons.

  Patel said, “After consecutive droughts, some good rain came and just as farmers began making big preparations for rabi sowing, you took away all the cash. A report by   itself says farmers’ earnings went negative for November and December. Vegetable farmers, flower farmers had to throw their produce on the roads of Gujarat. Yeh hai apka badlav? When farmers were finally about to get a good crop of wheat and pulses, you began to import these for much cheaper prices and distorted the market. Before the 2014 elections, you said you would give farmers 50% profit. Then you said you will double their incomes by 2020. In fact, they have fallen due to demonetization.”
 
 Patel also raised the issue of atrocities on Una dalits.
