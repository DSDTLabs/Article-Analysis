BHUBANESWAR: The   of Chandaka wildlife sanctuary on Tuesday night nabbed a wanted poacher from   area with a country-made gun. 

 With no right-hand palm and no left arm, Bishnu   was caught by the department officials based on an intelligence report. Wanted in several poaching cases, he had long been giving the forest personnel a slip. 
 
 "Two of his aides, however, managed to escape. They were planning to lay a trap to kill animals. Pradhan also used to sell the meat of prey animals. He knows the geography and topography of the sanctuary and the places of prey concentration," said divisional forest officer (Chandaka) Kedar Kumar Swain. 
 
 Bishnu had lost his palm and arm while making explosives a decade ago. He used to make explosives to kill animals. "Despite being handicapped, he is a sharpshooter," said a forest official. With Bishnu's arrest, other small-time poachers will desist from entering the forest and killing the animals. 
 
 Bishnu used to hunt barking and mouse deer, wild big and boar. "We are trying to break the network of his meat trade so that others involved in the racket can be brought to task," said the official. 
 
 In April last year, two poachers were arrested from the sanctuary while trying to hunt an animal.
