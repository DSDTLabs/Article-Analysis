ALLAHABAD: The red-green buses of  ' run by   (UPSRTC) might soon sport a whole new look. The name Lohia might be replaced with  , Bhimrao Ambedkar or Atal Bihari Bajpayee. 

 The   was started by the   government in 2015 to connect remote villages with cities. Since it was meant for the rural populace, the fare of these buses was also kept 25% less than that of other buses. The department would be making a presentation to the transport minister in Lucknow on April 8 in which removal of the 'Samajwadi colours' would be discussed, apart from other issues. "We are preparing detail regarding the colour to be used and expenditure to be incurred on painting the buses," said a senior officer preferring anonymity.
 
 Minister of State, transport, Swatantra Dev Singh said over the phone, "The buses are painted with Samajwadi Party colours, flags and also bear the name of their ideologue. Public transport and ambulances are essential services extended to public and should not be used as a medium to publicise a party." He said the earlier government had make a mistake which the current government would correct.
 
 However, a senior department official said, "Unnecessary expenditure will be incurred on removing the colour and applying new coat on over 550 buses. It is the public who will have to pay for the cynical decision of the state government."
 
 The buses were assembled at a workshop in Kanpur. To colour the buses, they would be brought to the workshop from various parts of the state and would be sent back after the same. "It will be old wine in new bottle," said the officer.
