AHMEDABAD: A   law student was allegedly beaten up for having a moustache in a   village where another youth from the community was assaulted just five days before for the same reason. The attackers are suspected to be members of an upper caste.

 The alleged assault occurred in Limbodara village, about 15km from  , when the victim,   (30), arrived to visit a friend at Rohitvas, a Dalit neighbourhood, on Friday night.
 
 Maheria is being treated for his injuries at a hospital in Gandhinagar. On September 25, men suspected to belong to the Darbar community had attacked a 24-year-old named Piyush Parmar over his moustache.
 
 Krunal told TOI, “A man from the Darbar community first hurled abuses at me and then beat me up with a police cane. He repeatedly asked me if I wanted to be a darbar by sporting a moustache.”
 
 Kuldip Maheria, 27, another youth, alleged Dalits in Limbodara were neither allowed to enter the village temple nor to participate in the main garba event. “A Dalit groom cannot ride a horse at his wedding,” he added. The sarpanch, Ranjitsinh Vaghela, was not available for comment.
 
 Gandhinagar superintendent of police Virendrasingh Yadav said a complaint had been registered for the assault on Krunal, as well as under the prevention of atrocities Act. “A complaint has also been registered by members of the Darbar community,” he said.
 
 A social media campaign begins In the wake of the assaults, Dalit youngsters in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar have launched a social media campaign in solidarity with the two men attacked in Limbodara. They are clicking selfies of themselves twirling their moustaches and posting them on Twitter and Facebook. Hashtags such as ‘#JativaadNaVirodhMa’ (opposing casteism), ‘#PiyushbhaiNaSamarthanMa’ (in support of Piyushbhai), and ‘#SamidhanNaSamarthanMa’ (in support of the Constitution) are going viral on social networking sites.
