MARGAO: Minister for tribal welfare   has said that the state would soon write to the Union ministry for tribal welfare seeking relaxation in criteria in the central acts for declaring predominantly tribal-inhabited hamlets as ‘scheduled areas’. 

 This will facilitate the state to carry out infrastructural development works,   said, adding that as most of such villages are located in forest areas, prevailing rules prohibit any sort of development works like road construction, etc, there. 
 
 Stating that he has already held preliminary discussions over the matter with chief minister  , who holds the forests portfolio, Gaude said the state government would try to prevail upon the Centre to effect amendments to certain acts. 
 
 Gaude told TOI that, in his recent meeting with the Union minister for tribal affairs  , he apprised him of the need to grant special concession to Goa considering the small size and tiny population of the state. Gaude said Oram has agreed in-principle. 
 
 “The criteria pertaining to the declaration of scheduled areas have turned out to be a hindrance in providing basic infrastructural facilities to such villages lying in forest areas, including construction of roads,” the minister said.
 
 Gaude was speaking with reference to the proposed development plans for Vavurla village in Quepem taluka by the tribal welfare department. TOI was the first to highlight the plight of the village in May 2015.
