KOLKATA: Automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra is setting up a state-of-the-art digital spare parts centre in   to serve the entire eastern region. The Rs 150 crore facility will come up on a 13-acre plot and will have a covered area of 2.20 lakh sq ft.

 Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of BGBS, M&M chief purchase officer   said the facility will generate 520 digital jobs where people will be trained to operate in a fully-computerised environment.
 
 In the conventional system that is in operation at the facility in Pune, a person is handed a job of picking up a part for despatch. He then locates the part, brings it back, gets the inventory updated and then hands it over to despatch. At the centre in Kharagpur, workers will be equipped with hand held devices where parts requirement will be notified. Once a person picks up a part, he has to scan the code and then place it on a conveyer belt for it to get packed and shipped.
 
 The facility at Kharagpur will stock up to 40,000 components at a time across all its businesses — generator sets, commercial equipment, passenger vehicles, trucks and tractors.
 
 Apart from ensuring smart management and operation of the facility, the setting up of the centre will reduce the lead time for parts delivery in the region. At present, it takes up to a week for parts to arrive in Kolkata and up to as long as three weeks for it to be delivered to towns in the north-east. “Once the Kharagpur unit is in operation, Kolkata will get the part the same day while delivery to north-east will happen in three-five days,” said Sikka.
 
 Construction of the unit will commence in April and the facility is slated to be operational by September 2018. 
 
 M&M is also consolidating its facility in Maharashtra by shutting down the rented Bhiwandi unit while retailing the one at Kanhe near Pune. Apart from western India, M&M has a similar facility at Jaipur for the northern zone. The Kanhe facility will continue to cater to southern markets.
