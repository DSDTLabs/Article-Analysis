PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Four   contractual   have applied for cleaning drainage chambers with modern machines in all eight zones of the city for eight years.

 Their services would include operation and maintenance of the vehicle-mounted suction-cum-jetting machines with recycling facility. Civic officials said the contractors should train their workers properly to operate the machines and   the chambers.
 
 The shift from manual scavenging to mechanized operations comes in the wake of the death of labourers while cleaning   in  . In September last year, a contractual labourer died due to suffocation while cleaning a drainage chamber at Kalewadi. Another labourer died as he had inhaled poisonous fumes inside a drainage chamber at   in June 2013. 
 
 The agencies have sought some suggestions and clarifications from the municipal corporation on issues such as not slapping penalties in cases of breakdowns of machines due to site conditions and free-of-cost parking facilities for the safety and maintenance of the machines. 
 
 The civic body has asked the agencies to provide demonstrations of the vehicles within three months. The annual cost of cleaning the chambers in each of the 8 zones will be Rs 1.35 crore. 
 
 The civic body will provide the agencies with 1 lakh litre of water from the STPs for cleaning the GPRS-fitted vehicles.
