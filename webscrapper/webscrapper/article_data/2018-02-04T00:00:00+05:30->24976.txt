Mornings are when I embrace ‘possibilities’. Sipping on a soothing mug of warm lemon tea, I go through daily affirmations, the wish list of all aspects of my life – from career, health, relationships to home. Nothing is too silly or too serious. In that misty time before I’m truly awake, and the door to my subconscious is still ajar, I can and do create my own reality.

  But the magic begins with me. If I want a world of love and peace, I need to first feel that love and peace towards myself. So, just before I’m ready to unleash the chaos of the day, I play my favourite Erik Berglund’s album Angelic Harp Music. 
 
  While I wait out the inevitable “Mom, 5 minutes please!” I scan my affirmations linking them all to powerful visual images. This is a neat trick I picked up over the years attending the Global Festival of Spiritual Sciences. This visualisation tool has created miracles in my life. While the strains of Erik’s harp breezes over our insane mornings — breakfast, forgotten homework, missing shoes, over-worked husband — I surrender to the angels. The more we align to our inner being, the more heaven becomes a place on earth.
