PANAJI: The cabinet of the Manohar Parrikar-led government on Wednesday approved the rationalization of tax paid at the time of registration of motorcycles and cars at regional   

 Although the move is expected to decrease the   by approximately Rs 6 crore, the government expects to increase its mop-up through higher registration of vehicles.
 
 The decision to accord approval at the third cabinet meeting follows Parrikar’s promise to lower registration taxes on motor vehicles. He had made the announcement while presenting the state’s budget for the new financial year.
 
 “Rationalization of taxes paid during vehicle registration will provide the automobile sector with relief. While the high taxes imposed on expensive cars have been slashed, the government is hopeful of covering loses to some extent through the registration of more vehicles. Many citizens used to otherwise register their vehicles outside the state to save taxes,” an official said.
 
 The move will benefit luxury vehicles that cost above Rs 15 lakh, as this bracket has seen the most reduction in taxes. Motor tax payable for cars that cost over Rs 15 lakh and up to Rs 35 lakh is 13%. Vehicles above Rs 35 lakh will attract 14% as against the earlier 18% in taxes.
 
 “In the case of high-end vehicles, purchasers chose to evade the levy by registering their vehicles in states that have a lower incidence of tax, thereby causing losses to the state exchequer. I propose to rationalize this levy,” Parrikar said in his budget speech last month.
 
 The cabinet also gave ex post facto approval to the extension of   hired by the Goa   Management Authority and the Goa Football Development Corporation.
