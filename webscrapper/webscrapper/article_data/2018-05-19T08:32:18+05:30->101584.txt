LUCKNOW: Nine-year-old  , injured in an attack by savage dogs on Thursday morning, succumbed on Friday at   district hospital, taking the toll to 14 since November last year. 

 The autopsy report, however, stated the cause of death as respiratory failure. A doctor said, "Sonam choked while drinking tea. We had warned her parents not to offer her anything to eat or drink as she had deep injuries in the neck."
 
 Chief medical superintendent, Sitapur district hospital, Dr Anil Agarwal told TOI, "Sonam was responding well to treatment. Till Thursday night, she was improving. On Friday morning, her parents probably gave her tea that choked her wind pipe, causing her to choke and triggering her death. Her parents went against our advice and offered her tea."
 
 Sonam's father, Acchelal, was inconsolable. Her relatives Sushil, Devesh and Rita expressed anger at the apathy of the administration in handling  . Devesh said, "The administration is responsible for her death." Sonam was attacked by a pack of four dogs on Thursday when she went to fields with two friends and was rushed to Sitapur district hospital.
 
 The administration has not been able to control dog attacks despite conducting combing operations in the district which has mere 3.81% forest cover. Two children have died while three were injured in dog attacks since CM  's visit to Sitapur.
