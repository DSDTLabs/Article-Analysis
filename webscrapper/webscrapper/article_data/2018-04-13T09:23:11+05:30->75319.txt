MYSURU: There is a poll twist to this Akshaya Tritiya (April 18) in  . The occasion is believed to be auspicious for buying gold as it is believed to multiply one’s wealth, but astrologers in   say it is also the most auspicious day for candidates to file their nominations for the May 12 elections.

 
 Filing of nomination papers is set to begin with the notification of elections on April 17.
 
 “Many political leaders are approaching me seeking suggestions on a good day to file the nomination papers. Akshaya Tritiya is always a good day to start any work,” said  , an astrologer from Chamundipuram. “Of the seven days between April 17 and 24, no other day is as auspicious as April 18. A few candidates may opt for other days based on their horoscopes,” he said.
 
 Ramesh Pai, an astrologer from   in Mysuru, too said he was advising many leaders to file their nominations on Akshaya Tritiya.
 
 However, there are candidates who are not ready to go by the belief. JD(S) candidate from Chamaraja constituency K S Rangappa said. “I don’t believe in any day being good to do something. So I am not going to file my papers on April 18 just because it is Akshaya Tritiya.”
 
 Social activist KS Shivaramu said filing of nomination papers based on one’s astrological sign was not only superstitious but also anti-constitutional. “Voters must not vote for candidates who file nominations on suggestions from their astrologers,” he said.
