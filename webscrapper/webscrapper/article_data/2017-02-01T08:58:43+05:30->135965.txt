PUNE: Attendance in schools across city dropped by at least 30% on Tuesday following the ‘chakka jam’ ( ) agitation called by transporters in   against the  . 

 Some schools declared holiday on Tuesday, while many parents had to drop their children to schools as transport vehicles refused to ply. However, some school bus and van operators dropped and picked up children in the morning. Officials at several schools said student attendance had dropped marginally.
 
 Seema Lakhani, a resident of Kalyaninagar, said, “I am a working woman. I got to know about the strike on Monday itself when our transport operator told us about it. I had informed my office that I would be late to work. I dropped both by kids to school while my husband picked them up later.” 
 
 Many parents had to take half day or full day leave, while others decided not to send their children to schools. Madhuri Deshpande from Vadgaonsheri said, “I have a baby at home so I could not drop my child to school.”
 
 The Union government, earlier this month, revised transport-related fees while hiking late fees for permit renewals and charges for other documents. Transporters across all sectors have opposed these revisions claiming that “the hike is steep and unjustifiable”. They have demanded urgent rollback, failing which they would intensify their stir.
 
 Maruti Jadhav, an autorickshaw driver who ferries students of St Arnold’s School in Vadgaonsheri, said, “Although I ferry students for a short distance, I decided to keep off the road to avert any problems. I had informed parents two days earlier about the strike.”
 
 Suman Sirkar, principal of a school in Aundh, said, “We had put up a notice saying that attendance was not compulsory on Tuesday and that only those students should attend school whose to and fro transport could be arranged by parents. There was sizeable drop in attendance, but classes were conducted as usual.”
