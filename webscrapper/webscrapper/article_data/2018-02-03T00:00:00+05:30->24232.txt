 has finally bitten the bullet — he will be playing the role of a cop for the first time in Thimiru Pudichavan. The film, directed by newcomer  , will go on the floors from the first week of March. Says Ganeshaa, “This is a first — Vijay Antony being featured in a cop film. Instead of the regular hero-villain kind of sequences, this one is a mind game. There will be power-packed action sequences and an intense drama. It will evoke social awareness and target the youngsters of today to suggest whom they should follow. ” The director is certain that the audience will see a different Vijay Antony in this film. 

 With the rest of the cast and crew still being finalised, Ganeshaa informs that Vijay Antony will be composing music as well as editing the film. “This story was written keeping him in mind long ago. To be precise, I met him three years ago with this story. I was in no mood to settle for someone else for the role as I felt he would be apt for it. Eventually, things fell in place and Vijay was on board,” says Ganeshaa, who has earlier worked with SS Rajamouli. There will also be a silambam portion in the film, for which Vijay is presently undergoing training. The film will be made in Tamil and Telugu.
