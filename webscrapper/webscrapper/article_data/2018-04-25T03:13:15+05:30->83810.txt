NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Tuesday started test runs on its 8.10km Pink Line stretch between   and Sir   stations. The line is expected to open in June and will connect four major markets in the city — Sarojini Nagar, INA, South Extension and Lajpat Nagar.

 The first section of the 59km Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar corridor between Majlis Park and Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus stations was opened in March. Two more sections — South Campus to Lajpat Nagar and   to Trilokpuri — are expected to open by June. The test run was flagged off by DMRC managing director  .
 
 “In these test runs, the interface of the train will be checked to ensure there is no physical infringement with civil infrastructure during the movement on the track and also various subsystems of coaches will be tested,” a DMRC spokesperson said.
 
 The new signalling technology, Communication Based Train Control (CBTC), that allows driverless train operations will also undergo rigorous testing in stages.
