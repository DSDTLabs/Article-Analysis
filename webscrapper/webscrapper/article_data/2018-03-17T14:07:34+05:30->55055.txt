MADURAI: Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) leader   has claimed that his party will present the next Tamil Nadu budget after a “sweeping victory” and that the one presented on Thursday would be the last of EPS and OPS. Dhinakaran who launched his party at Melur in Madurai on Thursday was speaking to mediapersons on Friday. 

 He said that deputy chief minister   had presented the budget as a mere formality as it had ignored many important aspects. “EPS and OPS cannot win elections with just the ``irrattai illai’’. Instead, they also need the people’s support which can only be garnered by concentrating on projects and schemes needed by the people,” he said.
 
 “They have been shaken by my party flag and have gone to court claiming that it looks like the   flag. AIADMK party flag is 50 per cent black, 50 per cent red with white in the middle and Anna’s image. But, our flag is 50 per cent white in the middle with 25 per cent each of black and red on the borders,’’ he said. He claimed that the party he launched was not a new one but only a different faction of the AIADMK under which they would function with the cooker symbol till they wrested the party name and symbol. Dhinakaran said that the image of Jayalalithaa on the flag also stood for ‘Dravidam’ though the term did not figure in the party’s name. 
 
 Later, Dhinakaran visited a church in Koodalnagar where members of the Christian community alleged that they were attacked on March 11. While condemning the attack, he said that if ‘Amma’ had been alive, the people responsible for it would have been arrested under the Goonda act. ``It is the responsibility the Hindus who are a majority to protect their minority counterparts,’’ he said. ``My party will be secular and protect people of all religions and castes,’’ he added.
