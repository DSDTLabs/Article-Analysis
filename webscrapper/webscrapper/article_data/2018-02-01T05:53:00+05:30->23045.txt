 Chennai: PMK leader S Ramadoss on Wednesday hit out at chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for deciding to meet his Karnataka counterpart, Siddaramaiah, in Bengaluru to seek the Cauvery water due for Tamil Nadu this year. “The Tamil Nadu chief minister should take an all-party delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to save the standing samba crop,” he said.
 
 In a statement, Ramadoss said the chief minister’s decision would do no good to the state, as his counterpart would not budge, given the impending assembly elections in his state. He said Siddaramaiah might attempt to drag the issue through continuous talks. “He may even cite the talks before the Supreme Court and avoid the intervention of the tribunal and courts, causing setback to Tamil Nadu,” Ramadoss said. The meeting between the chief ministers could happen only after the Karnataka budget on February 16, and water release thereafter would not benefit the standing crop.
