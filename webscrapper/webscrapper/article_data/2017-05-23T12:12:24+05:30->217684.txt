  : A 68-year-old vegetable trader set himself ablaze on the first floor of his shop in the new vegetable market on Sanaur road here on Monday. 

 Police said that the manner in which Taranjit Singh Chawla committed suicide - tying himself with a chain and locking it, - suggested that he did not want anyone to save him. The keys were yet to be found. 
 
 Chawla, in his three suicide notes recovered from his scooter and shop, alleged that family members of one of his 'friends' who took a loan of Rs 14 lakh from him and 'grabbed' one of his shops in the old vegetable market in the Ragho Majra area of the walled city were harassing him by sending legal notices.
 
 In the notes written in  , he alleged that Jasvir Singh, alias  , had refused to repay the loan and his family was asking for Rs 10 lakh from him to vacate his shop. Jasvir had also recently filed a case against Taranjit in a local court. Chawla had also received a notice which had upset him. 
 
 Chawla reached his shop around 7.30 am. As the shouts of the old man started emerging in the market, vendors and traders rushed to the spot. But due to non-availability of firefighting equipment and water, they could not save Chawla. Soon a fire tender reached the spot and doused the flames in the room.
 
 The body was later taken post-mortem examination and later it was handed over to his family members. 
 
 A team of senior police officials also reached the spot to take stock of the situation.
 
 The police have registered a case under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Jasvir Singh and other family members on the basis of the suicide notes recovered and a complaint filed by the Chawla's son Gurtej Partap Singh Chawla, a resident of   in   village. They were yet to be arrested.
