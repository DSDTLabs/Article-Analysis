PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Peeved over unauthorised hoardings marring the beauty of   city,  , chairperson, standing committee, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), has demanded that the civic administration send show cause notices to corporators for supporting unauthorised hoardings and opposing drive against them.

 Savale made the demand during the meeting of standing committee on Thursday.
 
 Corporators, cutting across party lines, have been demanding for around five years that strict action be taken against people erecting unauthorised hoardings. The civic administration conducts drives to remove hoardings but they again come up.
 
 Many political workers and residents erect unauthorised hoardings and seek the help of corporators and people’s representatives to stall action against them.
 
 Savale had also directed the civic administration during standing committee meetings to remove unauthorised hoardings but in vain. The proposal for allotment of a contract for two years to remove unauthorised hoardings came up for approval at the committee’s meeting on Thursday.
 
 “I have told municipal commissioner   that the civic administration must send a show cause notices to corporators who oppose removal of unauthorised hoardings. They should be asked the reason why they should not be disqualified. If the civic administration sends such notices to five-six corporators then it will send a strong message to them that they must not oppose the drive,” Savale said. 
 
 “The civic administration does not have adequate machinery and manpower to remove unauthorised hoardings due to which they cannot remove unauthorised hoardings in the city. Now the civic administration will be able to take action and rid the city of the menace of unauthorised hoardings,” she added.
