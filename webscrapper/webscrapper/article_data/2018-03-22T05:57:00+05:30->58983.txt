Nagpur: Slamming the civic authorities for failure to remove 314 slum dwellers from Lonar lake embankment, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday sternly directed them to evict the squatters within a week.

 A division bench comprising Justice Bhushan Gavai and Justice Murlidhar Giratkar also asked Buldhana Municipal Council to take police protection if needed and demolish the illegal structures. The respondents were told to shift the slum dwellers to the tenements which were specially constructed for the purpose but remained unoccupied for the last three years. They were directed to file compliance report within three weeks.
 
 The censuring came while hearing a PIL by lawyer Kirti Nipankar along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana, through counsel Anand Parchure, claiming that Lonar Lake was slowly degrading because of pollution and silting.
 
 Earlier, Parchure contended that though the last meeting of the ‘Lonar Reservoir Damage Control and Conservation Committee’ under Buldhana collector was held on February 6, neither its report nor the steps taken by the concerned respondent for the preservation of the historic crater was filed.
