Panaji: Agonda continues to be the favourite nesting site for flippered visitors, as in a flurry of activity eight Olive Ridley turtles laid more than 800 eggs in just over a month. In the previous season, which ended late June last year, Agonda had witnessed 28 nests being laid and more than 2,800 hatchlings crawling out to sea in a record season. Galgibaga, also in Canacona, and Morjim and Mandrem in Pernem had seen fewer flippered visitors. While Morjim has received only one visitor on January 14 this year, no turtles have surfaced at Galgibaga and Mandrem so far. The nesting season has been marked by a new time table as turtles arrive late in January, as compared to the usual October-March season. The hatchlings emerge even during the rainy season, as witnessed last year. But Agonda beach played host to the first nesting as early as October 19 last year. “A total of 41 turtle hatchlings were released,” a forest official said. The second nesting had occurred on January 7 and it was followed by six more nests, raising the total to eight so far. On February 3, the last weekend visitor laid 92 eggs.  The incubation period is about 55 days. “The second nest is likely to hatch late February,” the official said.  Agonda had 16 nests in 2013-14, eight in 2014-15 and six in 2015-16, besides 28 in 2016-17 season while Galgibaga had the highest 23 in 2013-14. Morjim had four in 2013-14, eight in 2014-15, six in 2015-16 and seven in 2016-17 Turtle nesting on Ashvem-Mandrem beach has been random, at one or two every season.
