NAGPUR: “While travelling to so many countries and getting a chance to explore different cultures, I can say that culture is when you find different ways of solving the same problem,” said 16-year-old John WT Cramer from the US.

 Like John, around 15 children from various countries such as US, France and   are in the city for cultural performance on   through Rotary Youth Exchange programme. The programme is scheduled on January 8 at Mankapur Stadium at 3pm.
 
 “When you are hungry, you invented food. In the same way, when you face any problem, you find a solution. This is what culture is,” John said.
 
 These students are adopted by different mentors of Rotary Youth Exchange programme and are placed in Nagpur, Nashik and Jalgaon among other places.
 
 The students shared their experience in India till now and expressed their love towards the food and festivals, especially Navaratra and Diwali, and how much they love India. “Indian food is quite spicy but we can’t resist ourselves from eating dosa, poha and samosa. We just love It.” they said.
 
 Tarun Patel, another member, said it is the love and affection which make the kids sad when they go back to their countries. “ It is very necessary for everyone to explore each other’s culture and grab the merits of what is best for them,” he added.
