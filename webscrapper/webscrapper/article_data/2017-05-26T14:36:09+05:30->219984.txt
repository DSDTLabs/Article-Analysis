DEHRADUN: State unit of the BJP is keeping its distance from the ongoing issue of Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s letter on the   probe in the NH-74 scam. Refusing to elaborate on the matter, state BJP president Ajay   on Thursday said “the state government is committed to take action against those involved in the scam” and that “the party is monitoring the development closely”.
 
  Bhatt, however, refused to react on the question of meeting between chief minister   and Gadkari in Delhi. Rawat has flown to Delhi on Thursday afternoon and will return to Dehradun by night. “Going ahead with the CBI probe will tick off the union minister, while any further delay in the probe will be raked up by the  ,” said another BJP leader on condition of anonymity.
  
  The land acquired for the NH-74 expansion is located in Jaspur, Kashipur, Bajpur and Sitarganj.
