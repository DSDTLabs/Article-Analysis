NEW DELHI: Chicago-based Indian American businessman  , who’s reportedly in the running to become the next US envoy to India, has denounced “fake news” as being behind recent reports targeting him in the US media. 

 Speaking to TOI, he said, “I am a victim of this fake news, which is part of a political agenda to attack President Trump.” A Washington Post story recently said Kumar was quietly lobbying for a job of ambassador to India. 
 
 Kumar said, “Fake news and fake media are a growing problem. President Trump and Steve Bannon (the president’s chief strategist) have spoken about it often. This year, President Trump will also boycott the White House Correspondents’ dinner.” 
 
 In response to the Washington Post story about Kumar lobbying for the India job, Pete Sessions, senior Republican Congressman and chairman of the powerful rules committee, said in an emailed statement, “Mr Kumar has played an integral role in bringing our House Republican Conference to be more involved with the Indian American community across the country.” He said, “He led a concerted effort to gain support (for Trump) from among Hindu voters in the 2016 presidential elections, especially in critical swing states.” 
 
 Of particular concern to Kumar is the media depiction of his relationship with his god-daughter Manasvi Mamgai, whom he describes as his “dharmaputri”. “This is part of a long Hindu tradition which included Sita as Janakputri, even Krishna, who was born to Devaki but raised by Yashoda. To question it with innuendoes is unfortunate,” he said.
