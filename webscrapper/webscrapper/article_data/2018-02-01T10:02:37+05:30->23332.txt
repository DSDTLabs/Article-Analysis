SALEM:   railway division on Tuesday warned job seekers not to believe unauthorized institutions’ claim to give training course for assured railway jobs.

 The Salem division administration came to know that a few private organisations were claiming to run railway safety education colleges and enrolled students on the assurance of giving railway jobs on the completion of the course. “They collected pots of money for such fake courses,” a railway official said.
 
 "People were warned not to get carried away by such false promises as   was not running any such colleges nor such courses," said  , divisional railway manager.
 
 He further said the recruitment for Railways were done only through authorised recruitment bodies such as   and Railway Recruitment Cell. “Southern Railway has no link with other institutions and would not be liable for claims arising out of such courses,” he added.
