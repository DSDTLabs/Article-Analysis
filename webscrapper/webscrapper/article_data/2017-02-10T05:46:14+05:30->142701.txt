SURAT: This 18-year-old youth who grew up in a government orphanage in the city was on   on Thursday when the test result for entry into   (BSF) was announced. 

 “I am the happiest person on the earth today. I promise all the students in the orphanage here that I will help them in every possible way to get into the armed forces. I want all of them to get selected for the armed forces,” said Dhanraj, who has been living in V R Popawala Children Home for the past eight years. 
 
 Dhanraj Sindhi has been selected for soldier general duty in BSF.
 
 Dhanraj was left in government children home in Ahmedabad when he was around four years old by his grandmother. He doesn’t know anything about his family. He was later transferred to Bharuch and from there to the city. 
 
 He was focused on getting into the armed forces. This is why he had been preparing hard for the physical test which he cleared with maximum marks. Dhanraj got through medical test without any trouble either.
 
 “I worked hard to clear physical test. I was helped by my teacher here for the written examination and I had also joined classes in Vadodara. I had no money but my teacher helped me to meet my basic needs,” Dhanraj said.
 
 “After completing studies up to Class X, Dhanraj opted for the BSF examination. He was completely dedicated towards his goal and thus cleared it without any problem. We helped him to the maximum extent possible. Many students from this children home are now well settled,” said Ramesh Khadsaliya, in-charge of the children home.
