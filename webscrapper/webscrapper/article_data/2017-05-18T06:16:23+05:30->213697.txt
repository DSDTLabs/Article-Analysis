KOCHI: Many   have introduced software which requires prescribing   along with the brand name by doctors. However, these hospital pharmacies only keep three or four branded drugs produced by top   to ensure quality.

 Incidentally, even then the adherence of doctors writing the generic drug names in the corporate hospitals is just about 60% to 70%.
 
 “With the introduction of electronic medical record systems in corporate hospitals, we are now insisting on both generic and branded names. However, our prescription audit done in the last two years show that just about 70% doctors do this. This is mainly because every year we get nearly 150 new doctors who tend to follow old practices,“ said Dr  , medical superintendent, AIMS.
 
 “Though we ask doctors to prescribe both generic and brand names, only 20% to 30 % adhere to this. However, more than 50% prescribe medicines with their generic name,“ said VPS Lakeshore chief executive officer AK Abdulla.
 
 Even though these hospitals ask their doctors to prescribe generic names, they are wary about storing generic drugs from unknown brands. So the hospitals stock three to four high quality brands. Sources said corporate hospitals select them from 50 to 100 best known pharma brand names that meet their requirement and price.
 
 “Government is yet to stop proliferation of pharma companies that make low quality drugs. Until the government doesn't take steps to ensure that quality and infection control in pharma, the doctors will continue to worry about quality of generic medicines and opt for medicines of known brands. We can't risk the patient's life,“ said Dr M I  , chairman and mana ging director, KIMS Healthcare Group.
