KOLKATA: A car parked in the basement of the   parking lot   on Monday when   were suddenly alerted about the ‘suspicious vehicle’ that lay abandoned for two months. Finally, the owner turned out to be an airport staff who had left the car in the ‘secure’ space after the battery had died. 

 “It was evident that the car had not been used for long. What appeared to be an AAI sticker on the dashboard turned out to be a pass issued by the airport cargo wing,” said Babulal Yadav of MS Enterprise that operates the parking lot.
 
 After an alert that raised questions on why the parking agency staff or CISF had not acted for two months and allowed the vehicle to lie unattended, airport officials said the parking agency staff was aware of the owner. “The car belongs to Nirmala Kumari, a housekeeping staffer at the airport. The alarm was needless,” an airport official said.
