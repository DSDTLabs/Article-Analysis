Producer   has filed an injunction in the City Civil Court in Hyderbabd seeking a ban on the release of  . The filmmaker contends that the upcoming   Rajput-Kriti Sanon- starrer is a copy of his 2009 Ram Charan-starrer  . 
“We, the makers of Magadheera, felt through various sources, including the trailer and publicity materials, that Raabta is being remade violating the copyrights of our film. Hence 
 we approached the Hyderabad Court seeking a ban on the film’s release. The Hyderabad Court issued notice to the producers of Raabta and a hearing has been scheduled for June 1 to decide whether Raabta should be permitted to release,” read an official statement issued by the film’s producer Allu Aravind.
 The makers of Raabta however 
 refuted the charges when contacted.  , one of the producers of the film, said, “I am aware of the case filed by the makers of Magadheera in a Hyderabad court but we deny all the allegations. Raabta is totally a different film. I believe they are just 
 assuming from the trailers because the plot deals with the subject of reincarnation. There are a lot of films based on the theme and as far as my understanding of the law goes, copyright laws can’t be applied to a plotline.”
 “In fact, we saw Magadheera and can confidently say that our film is totally a different one. This is not the first time in our industry that somebody has attempted a movie around the reincarnation theme. Moreover, we are ready to screen Raabta to the court and they can decide for themselves. I’m sure things will be crystal clear 
 after that,” he adds. 
 The court has schedule a hearing on the petition on June 1. Keep reading this space to find out the verdict.
