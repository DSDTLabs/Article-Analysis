The UP State Road Transport Corporation will soon be starting women-only   in Noida and   again. The buses will be fully air-conditioned and will also have a female driver and a female conductor. CCTV cameras will be installed on the buses, besides a GPS system. Each bus will also have a panic button that passengers can press in case of an emergency. The button will send a signal to the control room in the depot, from where the district police can be contacted.

  Anurag Yadav, assistant regional manager at the Greater Noida depot, says, "The central government has given funds of `83.4 crore to the   State Road Transport Corporation ( ) from its   to procure 50 AC buses for women in the state, four of which will be for Noida and Greater Noida."
 
  Officials estimate that the depot will get these buses by December, and in the meantime, the department will finalise things like routes and the frequency of these buses. As of now, the only thing finalised is that out of the four buses, two will ply on Noida roads while the other two will operate in Greater Noida. The buses will be subject to frequent checking by flying squads, which will make sure that only women board the buses and that all the security arrangements in the bus are up to the mark. Officials say that in a city like Noida, with a large number of working women and female students, these buses will be of great help.
 
  This is not the first scheme for a women-only mode of public transport in Noida. The district had a women-only bus service a few years ago. And in September last year, the Regional Transport Office in Noida started a pink auto service with 25 women-only pink autos (the number was gradually increased to 100). However, the service did not catch on as women generally avoided the autos, citing irregular frequency and the ‘cage-like’ grill in the autos.
