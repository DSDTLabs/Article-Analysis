 “Our air cadets will (now) get maximum flying exposure. We will likely commence actual flight training on the new aircraft in the summer,” said Wing Commander  , commanding officer of the 3 Air   (GP HQ). 
 
 The NCC (GP HQ) has a special air squadron to impart theoretical and practical flying training to its cadets. In 2002, the squadron got its first twin-seater, Zenair CH 701, which was grounded 10 years and 1,500 flying hours later. “The present aircraft has been allotted to NCC air squadron  . It will be flown and operated there,” Mahajan added.
 
 The squadron gets about 1,300 air cadets, most of whom are from the junior division (Classes VIII to IX). The rest are from the senior division (Graduation first to third year). “We give basic flying exposure to junior cadets. Senior cadets are supposed to get four sorties a year,” Mahajan said.
