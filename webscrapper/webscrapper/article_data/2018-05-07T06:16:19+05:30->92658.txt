HYDERABAD: With only a few days left for Intermediate advanced supplementary exams,   (BIE) officials are reportedly going easy on   during the summer vacation.

 The BIE officials, who have been conducting raids on colleges, said they were getting requests from parents and students to allow classes in the wake of supplementary and competitive exams.
 
 “We were asked to stop conducting raids from May 5 as the board was getting many requests from parents to allow colleges to run classes. Parents are worried that their wards won’t study for improvement or supplementary exams, which are scheduled to begin from May 14,” a BIE official said.
 
 The official further said that parents were also worried that children won’t study for competitive exams like Joint Entrance Examination Advanced, which would be conducted on May 20. They added that if they don’t let colleges to conduct classes, they wouldn’t even hesitate to shift them to a college in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.
 
 Parents also shared similar sentiments and said that it doesn’t make any sense to stop colleges from conducting classes for those students who would be appearing for advanced supplementary exams.
 
 “When the board is allowing colleges to conduct classes for those students who are appearing for competitive exams, why can’t they allow them to conduct classes for supplementary students. In fact, these students need guidance than the ones appearing for competitive exams,” Rakesh D, whose son sat for Intermediate first-year examination this year, said.
 
 After it was brought to their notice that many colleges were conducting classes during the summer vacation, the BIE officials had conducted daily surprise raids on Intermediate colleges with the help of special teams for almost two weeks. They had even locked down various colleges and issued show-cause notices for some for not following the board’s rules and conducting regular classes.
