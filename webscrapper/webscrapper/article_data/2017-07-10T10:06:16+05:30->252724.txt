Lee Child’s new   
  is a superb collection of short stories, some of the length of a novella, featuring Jack Reacher. The collection works as a great addition to any Child fan’s shelf, especially someone hooked to the   crime fictions. After 21 Reacher novels from Child, these short stories provide the reader with a refreshing outlook on Jack’s stories, since it deals with much of his past, and his formative years.

 The 12 stories follow Jack Reacher in his youth and most of them end with him in the present day. In one of the stories, a 13-year-old Jack already seems aware of mortal combat and fights off bullies physically, demonstrating his investigative abilities as well. “High Heat”, set in New York, follows a teenager Jack with a date, who helps the FBI catch a drug lord providing them with clues. In the newest story, “Too Much Time”, Jack witnesses a mugging and steps in to hand the thief to small-town cops. In another curious story, one curious story, “Everyone Talks,” Jack seems to be in a hospital bed after getting shot. He somehow takes down the antagonist, all the while sedated up and doped on painkillers, from the comfort of his bed.
 
 The award-winning   knows how to sell books. This format of a collection of stories seems not just appealing to pick up, but the idea of too many different mysteries and the associated thrill -- all in one package has definitely been lucrative to lovers of the crime fiction genre.
