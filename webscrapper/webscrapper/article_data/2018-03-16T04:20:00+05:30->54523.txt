Vadodara: When the Indian and Australian team turned up at the Reliance Stadium to play the second one-day international (ODI) on Thursday, not many had expected that the stands would be full of spectators. 

 But, Barodians created a history of sorts by turning up in large numbers to watch the match.
 
 In fact, Indian captain, Mithali Raj said that the last time she saw such crowd for a women’s cricket match was 14 years ago. “I saw such big crowd in Dhanbad in 2004 when India played ODI tournament against West Indies. It was the time when we used to play at small centres,” Raj recalled.
 
 “I am very happy that such big crowd turned up. Till the end, I saw everybody stayed to watch the match. I am hoping that they will turn up in bigger numbers on Sunday as it is a weekend,” Raj said. 
 
 Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) officials said that over 9,000 people came to watch the second ODI. Most of the stands were packed as the crowd cheered for the teams and danced to some music as well. 
 
 Australian player, Ellyse Perry, was also impressed with the turnout. “It’s brilliant for the players giving such performances. The team loved playing here in Baroda,” Perry said and added that she is expecting more people on Sunday. 
 
 BCA management that had been working hard to draw crowds to the stadiums too is happy. From social media management to installing hoardings, the team hired by the BCA to promote the ODI series made number of efforts to bring in the crowd. A world record event too was organized during the first ODI to spread the message of women’s empowerment. 
 
 “We had been reaching out to our members and citizens to ensure that they watch an international women’s match here. We are glad that thousands of spectators came to watch the match on Thursday. It wouldn’t have been possible without the support of the BCCI, BCA officials and the police department,” said Snehal Parikh, BCA secretary (in-charge).
