NEW DELHI: Dense   hit the capital early this morning, resulting in both flights and trains being affected as visibility fell below 300 metres in the capital. Over 20 flights were delayed in the morning at Delhi’s   airport with large queues and a huge rush reported due to these delays.

 
 
 
 People also took to Twitter, posting images of the rush at the airport, while some also questioned the management. "Pathetic situation at #DelhiAirport due to fog (sic)," said a Twitter user @devendrakumarty.
 
 The IGI airport has been facing long delays over the last few days with over 1,000 flights delayed since December 31 – when “very dense” fog first hit the IGI airport and visibility fell below 50 metres. While flights can land when visibility is below 125 metres, flights can only take off when the runway visual range (RVR) is above 125 metres.
 
 Airport officials, however, said today’s situation was much better with general visibility not going below 300 metres as compared to the last few days where ‘zero’ visibility was also reported.
 
 Railway officials, meanwhile, said 49 trains had been delayed, 13 were rescheduled and 12 were cancelled due to poor visibility.
 
 Delhi recorded its lowest minimum temperature on Thursday as the capital shivered at 5 degrees celsius – two notches below normal. Met officials have forecast a minimum of 6 degrees today and a maximum of 20 degrees.
