AGRA: A watchman for the famous Radha Rani temple at Barsana in Mathura district, one of two suspects, was arrested on Friday for the alleged   of a devotee from Odisha on the premises earlier this week. Police said the other suspect, who is on the run, worked at the temple as well. The two have been identified as Kanhaiya Yadav, the watchman, and Rajender Thakur, a cook.

 The woman was allegedly sleeping in the temple hall on the night of September 11, when the two allegedly struck and took her by force to a secluded spot within the shrine to rape her. The woman said though she subse quently went to the Barsana police station to report the rape, the cops refused to file an FIR. Police claimed that since she could not communicate properly “because of the language problem“, the station in-charge may not have understood her.
 
 Police have now arranged for a translator to record her statement, and will send her for a medical exam.Meanwhile, Mathura SSP Swapnil Mangain told TOI that a case of gang rape had been registered against two accused, and CCTV footage from temple recovered. He added that Rajender had been traced, and said he had also ordered an investigation into woman's claim of police inaction. “If her allegation is found to be true, disciplinary action will be taken against the concerned officer,“ he added. An official at the temple said, “The woman, 45, is being looked after by other devotees. Her husband and child reportedly died a few years back. Both the accused have been sacked by the temple management.“
