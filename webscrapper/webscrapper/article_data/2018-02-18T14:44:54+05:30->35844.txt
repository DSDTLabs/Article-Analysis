INDORE: The   constituted by the   for conducting   of Indore high court   as per one bar one vote (OBOV) principle, will take   of the bar association administration from February 19. 

 The order passed by the high court in the PIL seeking implementation of OBOV principle was delivered to the members of the ad hoc committee on Friday afternoon after which it was declared on Saturday that a meeting will be held on Monday when the process will begin for the election of the new high court bar association’s executive committee. 
 
 The term of the last bar association ended on January 25, while the PIL was pending. The court in the judgment had appointed a committee of seven members to take over the functioning of the bar association with immediate effect and to prepare a voters list of those members who had unequivocally chosen to cast their vote at the Indore high court bar association. 
 
 “Since 10 am on Monday we will take over the bar association’s functioning and convene a meeting over how the elections have to be conducted,” ad hoc committee chairman advocate Champalal Yadav said. 
 
 The other members of the committee appointed by the high court are BI Mehta, Pradeep Choudhary, RS Chhabra, Sudhir Dandawate, and Ritu Bhargava. Advocate Mini Ravindran has been appointed as the secretary of the ad hoc committee. 
 
 Meanwhile former bar association executives, who had opposed to the implementation of the OBOV rule at Indore high court bar association, now plans to challenge the high court order before the Supreme Court. 
 
 “However, the appeal before the Supreme Court will be filed after seeking guidance from the state bar council and the bar council of India. We will act according to response we get from these two bodies,” said Indore high court bar association former secretary Anil Ojha.
