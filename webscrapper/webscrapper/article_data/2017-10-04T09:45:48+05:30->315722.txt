AHMEDABAD: The body of 23-year-old sailor in the Navy, Raxit Kumar Parmar, who died of bullet injuries at the Kochi Naval Base on Sunday will be brought to the city on Wednesday. 

 Sources said that Parmar is suspected to have committed suicide.
 
 His body will be flown to Ahmedabad from where it will be taken to his native Dadusar village in Mahuda taluka of   district in Gujarat. 
 
 Parmar is survived by his parents and a brother who went to receive his mortal remains. Since Parmar's suicide was a case of unnatural death, the incident was reported to Kochi police who are currently investigating the matter. 
 
 Kochi police had said that preliminary inquiry suggests that the sailor had committed suicide. “The bullet was fired from a 20-round gun. It appears to have entered through the sailor's chin and came out piercing his skull,” said S Vijayan, assistant commissioner of police, Mattancherry. 
 
 Parmar had a ‘love marriage’ in August and had applied for 25 days’ leave starting from October 7, the police said.
