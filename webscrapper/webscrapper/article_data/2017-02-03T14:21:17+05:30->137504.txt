PATNA: The Patna police’s investigation into an alleged Army recruitment racket seems to have gone off track with the   stalling the arrest of Army officers Devle and Shekhar on the ground that the   would be needed to arrest them.
 
  The CrPC does not empower police to arrest personnel of armed forces. According to Section 45 of the CrPC, “No member of the   shall be arrested for anything done or purported to have been done in the discharge of official duties, except after obtaining the consent of the central government.”
  
  Apparently in view of the CrPC provisions, the cantonment authorities on Thursday wrote to Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj, seeking time to get the Centre’s nod.
  
  “The letter does not mention any time frame as to when the duo would be handed over to police,” the SSP told newsmen. According to him, Lt Col Siddhartha Sharma’s letter says the Army will produce the duo before the civilian court concerned, but has not given any date even for it.
  
  The alleged racket was unearthed following the arrest of Munna Kumar, Rahul Kumar,  , Nitish Kumar Singh and Vicky from Shivala under the Shahpur police station area in Patna district on January 28.
  
  “Kingpin Munna told interrogators he would take Rs 3-5 lakh each from candidates aspiring for recruitment in the Army. He used to make arrangements for the candidates to clear fitness test and written exam with the help of Devle and Shekhar,” the SSP said.
  
  The SSP said Muuna, currently in judicial custody, would be taken on police remand afresh for further interrogation after the suspected Army personnel are handed over to police for interrogation. “Involvement of a colonel of recruitment board and other Army personnel can only be confirmed by Devle and Shekhar,” the SSP said, admitting their probe would remain off track till then.
