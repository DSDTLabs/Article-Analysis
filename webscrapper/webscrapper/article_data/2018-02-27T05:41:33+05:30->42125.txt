PATNA:   police have lodged an FIR against a   ( ) functionary, who was allegedly driving the vehicle that mowed down nine children in Muzaffarpur district two days ago. Police are yet to arrest the accused.

 At least nine children were killed and 10 injured when they were crossing the NH-77 after coming under a speeding SUV.
 
 “BJP functionary   was driving the SUV which crushed the nine children to death,” Minapur SHO Sona Prasad Singh said on Monday, adding that the police have conducted several raids at Baitha’s village, Fatehpur, to arrest him.
 
 Singh said the CCTV footage captured at a toll in Sitamarhi shows Baitha driving the SUV. The footage was sent for forensic examination to prove that Baitha was on the wheels.
 
 Muzaffarpur SSP Vivek Kumar said the accident took place when Baitha dashed against two women and tried to flee from the spot. “Sakina Khatoon, 65, and her daughter Samina Khatoon, 35, were injured. Baitha panicked and crushed the children while attempting to flee,” the SSP said.
 
  unit president Nityanand Rai said on Monday Baitha was suspended from the party for six years. Rai claimed that Baitha did not hold any rank in the party and was only a member.
