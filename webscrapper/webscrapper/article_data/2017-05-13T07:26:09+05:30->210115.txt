CHANDIGARH:   (AAP) on Friday asked Captain Amarinder Singh-led   to waive off farmers’ loans by May 31 as promised before elections. The party has warned of launching an agitation in case the deadline set by it is not met.

 In a press statement issued here on Friday, AAP state president   said that as per media reports, more than 40 farmers had   in the 56 days of the newly-formed Congress Government. He said the government apathy was the sole reason of the sorry state of peasantry in Punjab. He said the new government had completed two months but no roadmap in that regard was announced yet.
 
 Mann said although the Congress had replaced   in, nothing had changed for farmers in Punjab. He said the financial condition of the state couldn’t be an excuse to run away from the promise of waiving off the farm debt as the Congress was aware of the conditions when it was making promises before elections. Mann asked the chief minister to announce a time frame for loan waiver.
 
 Giving two weeks’ time for announcing waiver, Mann said if the government failed to do that till May 31, AAP along with the farmers of Punjab would start agitations throughout the state. He said along with farmers, government must announce waiver for the farm labourers as they were totally dependent on farming.
