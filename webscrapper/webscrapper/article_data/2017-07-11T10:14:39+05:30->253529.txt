LUCKNOW: A   prevailed on most   of the city throughout the day on Monday due to   after incessant  . 

 “There is hardly any traffic here usually but today, I found jams at three places from Mahanagar to Hazratganj. It took me an hour to cross the stretch that usually takes 20-25 minutes,” said Shilpa Rastogi, a teacher.
 
 Congestion peaked during school hours. Amrita Sahu, a parent, said “Because of rain, many parents came to pick their wards from schools, adding to the jams.”
 
 Waterlogged streets and potholes aggravated the situation and slowed down vehicular movement. The underbridge leading to Janeshwar Mishra Park was clogged due to backflow of rain water. There was heavy waterlogging near Baikunth Dham, on Shahmina Road, in Vishal Khand, Vijyant Khand, Chowk, Lalbagh near Nishat hospital, Tehseenganj and several other areas.
 
 “Most   of Vijyant Khand have huge craters. Since morning, two bikes have slipped and two people have been injured because of potholes,” said Radheshyam, a shopkeeper.
 
 Diversions for heavy vehicles at a few places in Old City also added to the congestion. The ripple effect was seen on most bylanes and connecting roads of Aminabad, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh, Nakhas and Chowk.
 
 It took hours for people to move from cis-Gomti to trans-Gomti areas. 
 
 Heavy turnout at all Shiva temples in the city also led to crowds on roads.
 
 “There was massive traffic at Daliganaj underbridge. Nabiullah Road too was blocked. Hardinge Bridge was also jampacked with vehicles. We finally took Dubagga main road for Alambagh,” said Pranav Joshi.
