New Delhi: Customs officials   foreign currency worth around Rs 40 lakh from two passengers at IGI airport on Tuesday. 

 The accused, both from Punjab, had concealed the currency in their rectum to avoid detection.
 
 Customs officials said the two, who were travelling to Abu Dhabi by flight 9W 582, were intercepted based on specific information.
 
 “A thorough personal search of the passengers resulted in the recovery of   currency, consisting 57,450 Euros and 600 UAE Dirham, worth around Rs 40.66 lakh. Both passengers had concealed the currency in their rectum in a polythene bag. They have been arrested,” said a senior customs official.
 
 Last year, customs had carried out a similar seizure at the IGI airport with a group of 4 passengers hailing from Punjab caught smuggling foreign currency inside their rectum. Officials say the two are suspected to be related to that group as the modus operandi was nearly identical and they belong to the same region as well.
 
 “We are probing further to check if there is a connection. This could be part of the same smuggling racket,” said a customs official.
