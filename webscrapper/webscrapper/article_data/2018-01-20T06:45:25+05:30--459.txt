 The CID crime has sent a letter to all police commissioners and range IGPs, asking them to allot physical space in every police station for  .
 
 Ashish  , DGP, CID crime and railways, said the Bal Corner will be a desk dedicated for minor complainants as well as accused. While primarily it will deal as front desk for minor complainants who come to the police station, it will also help minor accused.
 
 “Minor accused who are brought to police stations will be dealt with according to their age. The Bal Corners will also help in returning such   delinquents to the social mainstream,” DGP Bhatia said.
 
 The CID crime letter mentions that Bal Corners should be designed keeping children in mind. They should be clean, have clean drinking water, food, clothes and material for entertainment of children. “A child, whether an accused or a complaint, should feel safe and secured in such corners,” DGP Bhatia added.
 
 The letter stresses that juvenile accused should be treated according to their age. “Police station across the state have been directed to appoint a police officer as a child welfare officer and should maintain a different register for registering complaints lodged by minor victims,” said a police official.
 
 DGP Bhatia pointed out that such steps will help build friendly and homely environment for minor victims. “According to the Juvenile Justice Act- 2015, we have in place a Special Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU) to act as nodal office with a deputy superintendent of police rank officer. We also have an   (AHTU) which provides help to minor victims,” said a senior police official.
 
 The letter also mentions that steps to design Bal Corners in police station across the state will play an important role in providing a friendly environment in which a minor victim should feel safe and narrate things without any fear.
