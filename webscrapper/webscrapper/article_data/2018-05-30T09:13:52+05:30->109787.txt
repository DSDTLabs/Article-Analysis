CHANDIGARH: Taking serious note of employees’ strike affecting healthcare services,   health minister Anil   said all staffers of health institutions under the   (NHM) in the state had been included in Essential Service Maintenance Act (ESMA), 1956. Thus, such employees can lose their jobs if they go on strike, he added.

 The health minister said in that regard, all civil surgeons had been issued directions. The act would also be implemented on employees working in government hospitals under NHM for ambulance, mother and child healthcare, emergency and other essential services. “If employees of NHM go on strike, the emergency services in hospitals get affected and patients have to face many problems. This decision would ensure treatment of patients without any obstruction,” he added.
 
 He said that the striking staffers had been included in the Service Rule-2018 implemented in the state. Therefore, if NHM employees go on strike then actions would be taken against them under the Act. He said all civil surgeons had also been directed to send daily attendance and other activities of such employees at headquarters. They can appoint new employees in place of striking employees for ensuring smooth functioning of healthcare institutions, he added.
