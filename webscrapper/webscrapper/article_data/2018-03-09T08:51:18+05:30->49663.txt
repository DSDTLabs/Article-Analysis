CHANDIGARH: A district court on Thursday acquitted three people of stealing and selling off steel bars from bus-queue shelters.

 The main accused, Arjun, is on the run and the court has declared him a proclaimed offender, while those acquitted are Om Prakash, Narayan Kumar, and  , because the prosecution failed to come up with evidence against them.
 
 
 The matter dates back to December 5, 2016, when the accused were arrested. The police complaint suggests that a subdivisional engineer (SDO) passing through Sector 27 saw these three men cutting steel frame stripped off a   (Chandigarh Transport Undertaking) busqueue shelter outside a school ( ). When he asked them if they had permission and they failed to produce any document, he dialled 100 to call cops.
 
 A patrol squad hauld them up for theft. It was alleged that they had sold steel frames from the busqueue shelters to some individual. Police also recovered some of the stolen material from a forest area near   and booked these men under Sections 379 (punishment for theft), 411 (receiving stolen property dishonestly) and 34 (common intent in crime) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Defence counsel R P S   said: “These three men are innocent daily-wage earners.  , who is a proclaimed offender, is behind the crime.”
