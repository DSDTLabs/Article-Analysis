GHAZIABAD: A day after BJP’s landslide victory in the state, many from Muslim community expressed skepticism about the win and felt that SP or BSP was a safer choice for them.

 Parvez Malik, a voter from Ghaziabad said, “I hope BJP realises Muslims too have voted for them. Now it is their turn to strike a chord with the Muslim community. I wanted BSP to win this time, Mayawati has done a lot for the minorities.”
 
 Arzoo , a resident of Noida, echoed Mayawati's concern regarding EVMs. “There is something not right about BJP’s landslide victory. I suspect EVMs were rigged to facilitate a BJP victory,” Arzoo said.
 
 Tahsin Zahid, co-chairman of PHD Chambers of Commerce and a resident of Indirapuram said, “BJP cannot afford to neglect Muslims in the state. I expect BJP to set things right in the state. Equal oppurtunity for all communities is the need of the hour.”
