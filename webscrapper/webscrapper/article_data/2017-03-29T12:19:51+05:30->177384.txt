Anika asks fake   about Soumya, as one of the servants had spotted him speaking to her. In order to avoid a plethora of questions from Anika, Shivaay begins to fight with her. Anika cannot understand the reason behind Shivaay's absurd behaviour. 

 Just to calm him down, she throws water on him. But this makes fake Shivaay so angry that he holds her neck. Anika is taken aback and tells him how can he be so furious when they have played this game so many times before. 
 
 Shivaay excuses himself by saying that he is tensed about Priyanka's wedding. Anika thinks about Shivaay's changed demeanor but lets it go, thinking she might be wrong. 
 
  
 Anika overhears Shivaay conversing over the phone and decides to test him. She goes to him and talks about their honeymoon and things they share in common. At the end of it, Anika is sure of the fact that he is not her husband, but an imposter. 
 
 She recalls the words of the transgender and begins to wonder where her Shivaay is. While she tries to get the details from the number Shivaay called, she also begins to think of ways that would help her get to Shivaay.
