Kantilal Parmar and   were trapped by the crime branch when they were accepting money from Dr Krutesh Shah at another doctor’s clinic on Thursday.

 According to police, Shah had given interview to a local news channel about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on doctors taking favours from pharmaceutical firms during his recent visit to London. During the interview on April 21, Shah uttered an idiom in Gujarati language and he told the police that he apologized for it the very next day. However, a day after his interview was telecast, Shah got a call from Kanti whom he had treated several years ago.
 
 Kanti, who claimed that he is member of Bhartiya Dalit Panther group, told Shah that he may get calls from Dalit community members for using casteist slur against them in the interview . After a while, Naresh called up Shah and started threatening him. Naresh said that he and the other community leaders will agitate against him and also file a complaint. 
 
 “It was Kanti who made the plan to extort money from Shah. Kanti asked Naresh to threaten Shah and the former then tried to show the doctor that he was convincing Naresh to not file any complaint,” said H R Damor, police sub-inspector, DCB.
 
 Shah then sought help of Dr Pragnesh Bharpoda and Dr Bhikhu Parikh for intervening in the case. Naresh and Kanti then demanded Rs 50 lakh from Shah along with an apology letter for not filing complaint against him. After some negotiations, the accused duo agreed to settle the case for Rs 12 lakh. Parikh gave Rs 2.5 lakh to the duo. But they kept calling Shah and Parikh to recover the remaining amount.
 
 They kept threatening to hold protest march against Shah. Shah realized that the duo was blackmailing him following which he approached the crime branch and filed a complaint.
