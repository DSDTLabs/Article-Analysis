BENGALURU: With the Pre-University examinations coming to a close on Monday, the government has decided to bring a closure to the continuous agitation among PU lecturers and principals across the state.

 Tanveer  , primary and secondary education minister, said: “The government will discuss separate pay scales for lecturers and principals in government PU colleges.The department will recommend the addition of lecturers' salaries in the Seventh Pay Commission.“
 
 The move comes after a longdrawn battle between PU lecturers and the education department as the former demanded their salaries be increased to Rs 26,000 per month from the current Rs 22,000. Further, principals of government PU colleg es were upset as their salary has been on a par with that of lecturers, without an increase.
 
 The lecturers also had their way on BEd courses which they had to pursue for two years. As per the government order, the lecturers would be given a stipend of Rs 12,000 as they will be marked absent from duty during the two years.
 
 “We'll look at ensuring that the dies-non agreement will be cancelled by the cabinet,“ Sait said.
 
 Lecturers wore black armbands while conducting the PU exams which ended on Monday. Manjunath  , president, PU Principals' Association, said, “The minister has called for another meeting between April 13 and April 20 to finalize the salary hike and pay scales before submitting the proposal to the chief minister.“
