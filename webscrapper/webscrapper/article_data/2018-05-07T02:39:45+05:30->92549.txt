 Police said that in the second week of April when someone visited the BJP MLA, the woman leader was also present at the legislator’s house. The visitor started arguing with the MLA. The video of the incident had gone viral. A few days later, a school teacher posted a picture of the woman leader and the MLA with objectionable comments. Three portals carried a story on the basis of the post. 
 
 BJP leader Raman Mallik said no one is above law. “We respect freedom of expression, but carrying news without verifying facts is unreasonable.”
