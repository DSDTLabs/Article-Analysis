COIMBATORE: Traffic congestion at Ramanathapuram, Singanallur and Sungam would become a thing of past in a few years, if the state government’s plans to construct over-bridges at these three junctions on Trichy Road materialises.

 Chief minister   announced these projects at the collector’s conference in Chennai on Wednesday. Though he did not specify the cost involved, the chief minister said the work would begin in 2018-19. Palaniswami also announced another over-bridge on Trichy Road, the works for which would again commence in 2018-19. And this one would be constructed at L& T Bypass near  .
 
 This apart, work to construct an over-bridge at Thudiyalur on Mettupalayam-Ooty Road and preparation of detailed project report for another bridge at Lawley Road to facilitate smooth travel to Maruthamalai would be taken up, Palaniswami said in his speech. He has also promised three more bridges at Narasimmanaickenpalayam, Thudiyalur Junction and Saibaba Kovil Junction.
 
 When the chief minister visited the city to participate in MGR centenary celebrations in December, he had made a slew of announcements including construction of railway over-bridges at Thanneerpandal, Irugur, Neelikonampalayam, and a railway underpass at Gandhiji Road at a total outlay of 111 crore.
 
 Residents welcomed the announcements, but seemed skeptical about the timely completion of the projects as well as the specifications of the bridges. “Several bridges were completed after a long delay. The rail over-bridges, including those on Irugur-Peelamedu stretch, are delayed by almost 10 years. The rail over-bridge at SIHS Colony has been stuck for years because of land acquisition problem,’’ said a resident of Ramanathapuram.
 
 Government authorities were, however, hopeful but they admitted that there were issues concerning land acquisition in residential areas. “We might face challenges in land acquisition, especially in thickly populated areas like Ramanathapuram,” they said.
