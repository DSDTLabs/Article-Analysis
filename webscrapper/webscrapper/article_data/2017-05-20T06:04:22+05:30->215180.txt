LUCKNOW: Although   is down to its worst-ever tally in both the   and  , an encouraging response to its   has enthused the cadre in the state. The party claims that the number of new members during the drive has already touched 30 lakh. 

  “It’s an encouraging sign for the party just before civic elections,” says an old-timer. UP Congress chief   is coming to the city on Saturday to meet the district-level office-bearers and the returning officers, who are holding the membership drive.
 
 For a party which is out of power for 27 years, the beeline of aspirants at its Gandhi Bhawan main hall is a morale-booster. “Congress is still my party,” says 20-year-old Abarar, waiting for his turn to deposit Rs 5 fee to become a member of the Congress family.
 
 In fact, party leaders themselves are a bit pleasantly surprised over the impressive response as they had not expected such a turn out in the wake of the party’s debacle. “We had reached 45 lakh when the party had 22 MPs in 2009 and this time with just two MPs and seven MLAs in a House of 403, 30 lakh members have already enrolled,”says a Congress leader.
 
 Its official spokesman Dwijendra Tripathi said that unlike the past this time the party’s vice-president had imposed strict conditions on enrolling an individual as a member of the party and one has to submit his address proof, mobile number and a photo. Anyone is open to see and verify the membership drive claimed, Tripathi, who said that the similar encouraging response was being witnessed all over the state.
 
 An insider, however, said that the rise in the membership could be attributed to the forthcoming civic bodies elections. “I feel that a good number of individuals might be eyeing the party ticket,” he said, adding “even this is welcome for us. This is how there would be a connect between the Congress and the masses.”
