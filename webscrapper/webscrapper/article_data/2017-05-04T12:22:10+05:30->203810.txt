Goli gets a small bat for Malaiya, as the kid wants to bat first. Tapu sens asks Goli to bowl softly, but Malaiya hits a six on the first ball itself which surprises everyone. As the game proceeds, Malaiya scores all fours and sixes on Goli's balls and seems quite happy. After some time, Malaiya says that it is quite late and he has to head home, then Tapu sena comes forward and tells him that they would leave him home.
 
  When Tapu asks Malaiya, when would he invite them over to his place, the latter gets nervous and says that they can't come to his house. Tapu senses something fishy and asks his friends to follow him and know why he said that.

His father touches her forehead and says that she has high fever. Malaiya's family then sits together and eats lunch, while Tapu Sena looks at them. On seeing Malaiya's mother's health, Goli calls up Dr. Hathi and asks him to come over and check her.
