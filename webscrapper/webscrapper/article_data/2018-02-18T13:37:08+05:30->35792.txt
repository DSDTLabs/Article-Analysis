Actress  , who lost her mother   when she was 18, said she is still her biggest inspiration.

 "The woman who has inspired the most is my mother. I am a product of her disadvantages in life, and she tried to make sure that we took advantage of all of the opportunities that were afforded to us," quoted Spencer as said. 
 
  
  
 The actress said her mother taught her to be practical, grounded and hardworking from an early age.
 
 She said: "We had more than she did, and a lot less than a lot of people, even to this day. So she is the one woman that I credit everything to."
