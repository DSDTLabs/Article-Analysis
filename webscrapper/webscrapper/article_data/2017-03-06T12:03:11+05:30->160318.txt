SRIKAKULAM: As many as 91 couples tied the knot at a mass   at Nuvvularevu, a remote   inVajrapu Kottur mandal, on Sunday. 

 In this mandal, marriages are always between the local men and women and no dowry or any form of monetary exchange is allowed between families. This rule was made by the village elders almost a century ago. 
 
 They had come up with this rule after coming across incidents of domestic violence and dowry tortures in marriages between inter-village couples. The villagers fix an auspicious muhurtam every three years for the mass marriage and people from across the district visit the village to witness the event. 
 
 District officials are also invited to take part in the auspicious programme.
 
 S Suresh, a fisherman by profession, said the tradition always united them during difficulties. “We don’t take dowry. It keeps up away from several social evils,” he said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Behara Dharma Rao, the sarpanch of Nuvvularevu village, said most of the villagers are from the neighbouring state of Odisha and belong to the Kevati community. Nearly 10,000 people reside in the village and worship Tulasi Mata.
