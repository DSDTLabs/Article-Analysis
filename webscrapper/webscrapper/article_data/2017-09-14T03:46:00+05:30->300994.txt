Panaji: Imran Khan, a businessman, who was arrested by the special investigation team (SIT) in mining related cases, has been remanded to 2-day police custody by a local court.

 The SIT had sought 10 days remand to unearth “deep-rooted criminal conspiracy of theft of iron belonging to the state.’’
 
 Senior counsel, Nitin Sardesai appearing on behalf of Khan strongly opposed the police request before Irshad Agha, Principal District and Sessions Judge.
 
 Judge asked investigating officer Dattaguru Sawant to justify his request for 10-day remand as the defense counsel made a strong plea that Khan should be granted interim bail.
 
 Police officer told the court that there is a possibility that Khan would pressurize other witnesses who are willing to support the prosecution’s case. 
 
 Iron ore to the tune of Rs 320 crore was extracted by the accused, and its recovery is pending.
 
 Sawant pointed out that he did not get much time to interrogate Khan since his arrest last night and pleaded for 5-day remand.
 
 Sardesai told the court that no substance or material was produced before the court by the prosecution to justify their demand.
 
 “Where is the material to justify the remand,” Sardesai questioned. 
 
 He said there was no substance placed on record to substantiate the provision of the Prevention of Corruption Act slapped against Khan.
 
 Sardesai maintained that the applicant was not a public servant and there was no statement from witnesses that he had taken money.
