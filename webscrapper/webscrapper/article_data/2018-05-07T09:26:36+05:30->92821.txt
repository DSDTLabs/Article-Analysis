CHENNAI: A CBI court convicted a Southern Railways senior section engineer of graft charges and sentenced him to two years of rigorous imprisonment and fined him 15, 000. 

 A special CBI team arrested   for demanding 15, 000 from a railway contractor to record data of projects the contractor executed in 2014. 
 
 The railways in December 2012 awarded L G Ravi a tender, estimated at 97 lakh, for work on the Chennai-Gudur section. The project involved the laying of points and crossings between Ennore and  . 
 
 Under the agreement, the railways would provide raw material and Ravi would hire and pay the workers for the project, which was to be completed by February 2013. But the railways extended the contract till May 2014 due to delays in procuring raw material. Ravi approached the deputy chief engineer requesting to release the payment for work done and to close the agreement. Ravi met officials, including T Shivakumar, at   station on March 4, 2014.
 
 The CBI said the deputy chief engineer directed   to record the measurements of work Ravi had done. When Ravi met Shivakumar at his office two days later, the engineer demanded a bribe of 15,000. Ravi filed a complaint and the CBI set a trap to catch the engineer. 
 
 On March 7, Ravi met Shivakumar at My Lady Park near   and handed over the bribe. A CBI team caught Shivakumar in the act and booked him under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
 
 Principal special judge for CBI cases A Thiruneelaprasad pronounced Shivakumar guilty after hearing the arguments and going through the evidence. He sentenced the engineer to two years of rigorous imprisonment.
