NEW DELHI: Railway minister   said his ministry is putting in place a comprehensive monitoring system to stamp out violence on  , in the wake of a recent killing near the Capital.
 
  “If anyone is targeted because of religion, it will not be tolerated,” he said in an interview. “We have already directed railway police to be more active and improve passenger safety. It’s a telling message… whosoever is doing it should be given strictest punishment. We are putting in a centralised monitoring system and installing   in all trains.” The financially stressed Indian   is in revival mode, the minister said.
  
  “Railways is on the path of gradual recovery but it still has to be kept in the ICU as it needs to be strong enough,” Prabhu said.
  
  “Passenger revenue, which was down in the past five years, has now shown an uptick. We have registered almost 9% growth in the first quarter of this fiscal. We have launched five different premium train products.”
  
  The ministry will spend a total of Rs 8 lakh crore to upgrade the railways as part of efforts to improve safety and raise speeds. Prabhu said India’s first   will start services in 2022.
  
  Prabhu did not comment on the Comptroller and Auditor General report that said food served by railways was not fit for consumption.
