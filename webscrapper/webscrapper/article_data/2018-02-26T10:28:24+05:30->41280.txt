KERI: In most parts of Goa, the festival of   starts on the full moon day of Phalgun, the last month of the lunar calendar. In Canacona, however, this celebration is already underway, having started on the Saturday, the ninth day of the month.

 In Canacona, Shigmo has a vibrant celebration; it’s marked by folk dances, folk songs, and rituals deeply rooted in the past. On Saturday, for instance, folk troupes assembled in the temples of their village’s presiding deities, and, by invoking these gods, broke the coconut and began the celebration. 
 
 At the Agrasani mandap, six folk troupes from Loliem — Shelkar, Kolkankar,Tanshikar, Tamnekar, Pedekar and Polekar performed their folk dances. In nearby Poinguinim, Belwada, Mahalwada, Galaye, Borus, Khavat, and Partgal, forgetting their differences, displayed the unity of their village.
 
 In the forested villages of Cotigao and Gaondongrim, tribals of the Velip community descended into the hilly areas of ‘Devadano’. There, refraining from alcohol and non-vegetarian food, they perform folk dances like the Tonyamel and   every night.
 
 When they’re not in their own villages, they also visit other areas and present folk dances there, and are welcomed by each family with a ‘thali’ comprising coconut, rice, and sweets. There is also ‘veeramel’ in front of ancestral homes; a devotee, holding a sword, performs ritualistic dances in front of the sacred places.
 
 Folk researcher   from Amona says, “The   has been celebrated by us (in Canacona) since time immemorial and has provided a forum for displaying the talents and skills of folk dances inherited from many generations.”
