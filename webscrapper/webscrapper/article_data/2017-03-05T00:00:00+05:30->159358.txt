Women are buying their own jewels, not waiting for a gift

 When   was spotted sporting a huge rock on her ring finger a few years ago, everyone wanted to know who had given her the ring or who was the lucky guy? True to form, Sen shut everyone up by declaring: "I don’t need a man in my life to have diamonds. I can own them myself." Last year, she celebrated her rock in an Instagram post: "A diamond is forever... my most famous rock a massive ring I gifted myself a while ago that gently stated 'either beat the size of my stone or match the size of my heart'." She hashtagged it #celebrateyourself. Now a lot of women are seeing the Sen-se (pun intended) and following suit.
 
 
 
 Jewellery designer Garima Maheshwari says, "Today, more women are financially equipped and they love to mark their personal accomplishments or career milestones by rewarding themselves with gold or diamond." With women managing their own finances, spending their hard-earned money on something sparkly is definitely a must-do. Marketing professional Aarti Sinha is okay with the ‘treat (yo) self’ dictum. "I bought my first diamond ring out of my own salary at the age of 25. To me, it’s not just an accessory, it’s a personal milestone. Plus, the sense of pride and self-empowerment is priceless," she says.
 
 
 
 Maheshwari notes that another reason women prefer to pick their own trinkets is that they have definitive tastes now. Jewellery designer Leshna Shah attributes the change to "well-travelled women who are aware of global trends". Women would rather trust their own tastes and instincts. Shah says, "This has led to impulse buying. There was a time when jewellery shopping was a planned activity with the family, but this has changed. I have women of all age groups walking into my jewellery boutique with a clear idea of the design and budget in their mind."
