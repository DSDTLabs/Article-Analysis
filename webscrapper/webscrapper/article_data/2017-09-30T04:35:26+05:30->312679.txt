MUMBAI: Every day, Kalyan residents Shraddha Varpe and her father, who has a limp, would go together to work at the Kamgar Kalyan Kendra near  . 

 On Friday morning, as it was raining, the 23-year-old asked her father,   (53), to make his way down the overcrowded railway bridge while she waited near the ticket counter. 
 
 She said she would catch up with him after he got down the stairs. “She wanted shelter from the rain. Her father took approximately 10 minutes to get down and started calling her on her cellphone because of the sudden commotion all around. But she didn’t take her calls,’’ recounted family friend Bhimrao Dhulap. After police arrived, Varpe found Shraddha’s body.
 
 Varpe said they used to travel in the same compartment every day. But as she was in a saree on Friday, she travelled in the ladies compartment and then decided to wait near the ticket counter because she didn’t want her saree to get wet.
 
 The news of Shraddha’s death wasn’t told to her mother, Sudha, till the time of going to press as she is a heart patient. Although posters and WhatsApp messages were put out to offer Shradhanjali to the young victim, her mother was kept in the dark. Ganesh Tavar, an IT engineer from locality, was the first in the area to get information about Shraddha’s death. “I work in Prabhadevi. As soon as I heard about the mishap at Elphinstone Road station, I called up on her cellphone but there was no reply,’’ he said. Around 2 pm, a colleague of Shraddha picked up Tavar’s call and told about the mishap. Shraddha is survived with her father, mother Sudha, and two brothers.
