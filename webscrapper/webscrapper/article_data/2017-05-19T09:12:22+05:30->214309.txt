MUMBAI: The department of legal metrology (LMO) has issued yet another warning to the   ( ) and the   (MCA), which oversee the management of  , to curb overcharging on the premises.

 Controller of legal metrology, Amitabh Gupta, said, "Our officers conducted a surprise check during Tuesday's IPL match between Mumbai Indians and Pune Supergiants. We caught three stalls selling ice cream well over MRP. One stall named Dana Pani in the Garware Pavilion on the first floor was selling Magnum ice cream for Rs 100 as against the printed price of Rs 75. Stall no 3 at the Gavaskar Stand as well as Stall no 1 in the Vijay Merchant Stand were both charging Rs 60 for Cornetto ice cream whose MRP is Rs 55. Cases have been filed against them under the Legal Metrology Act for overcharging and cheating consumers."
 
 Gupta said, "These repeat violations by BCCI and MCA are a matter of grave concern. Earlier too we have booked vendors at Wankhede for overcharging on packaged goods. They had assured us they would appoint a compliance officer to check such malpractices. Still the violations continue."
 
 Meanwhile, BCCI and MCA both shrugged off responsibility. BCCI representatives asked TOI to contact MCA since it is that body which manages Wankhede Stadium. However MCA joint secretary Unmesh Khanvilkar said, "This particular match was a BCCI playoff so it was the BCCI which appointed the vendors. The earlier seven matches were managed by Mumbai Indians as the local franchisee. At that time it was their mandate to control overcharging by vendors."
 
 In December 2016, the LMO had inspected Wankhede during the fourth cricket match between india and England and booked M/s Wheels and More of stall no 007 for selling a litre of bottled for Rs 50 whereas the MRP was Rs 20.
