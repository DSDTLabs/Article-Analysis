Nagpur: “Jobs aspirants are being cheated in large numbers through ‘salami slicing attack’ using which cyber-criminals steal money,” psychologist and career counsellor Nitin Vighne explained while speaking on the pattern of   crime techniques to college students.

 Vighne was speaking on the occasion of ‘Police Rising Day’ at Dr. Vasantrao Deshpande Hall at Civil Lines on Saturday. Commissioner of   K Venkatesham, under the supervision of DCP (EoW) Shweta Khedkar, has organized the seminar based upon the concept of ‘Avoid falling prey to cyber crimes’ under the title of ‘Cyber safe City’ for college students . 
 
 The seminar also aimed to ease equation between the cops and the students so that the latter feel free to approach the police to lodge their complaints if needed, informed API Vishal Mane.
 
 Over 500 students from government ITI (vocational skills) college attended the seminar where joint CP Shivaji Bodkhe was the chief guest. Alongside Vighne, also present were vocational trainer V Murli and Chandrakant Ninale, joint director of vocational training.
 
 Vighne added, “Browsing Internet frequently is a psychological-ill behaviour which needs to be treated emotionally. Youngsterscan become victims of porn sites, online molestation and defamation.”
 
 Vighne, who also took psychological test of students during seminar, said online fake job employers, consultancies procure identity details of applicants and dupe them. He mentioned total 14 types of cybercrimes including cyber stalking like ‘Blue Whale Challenge game’.
 
 Murli advised the students on how to have self-control over one’s mind and take proper decisions. Bodkhe, in his interaction, asked the students to spread lessons in cyber security among the masses as their social responsibility. 
 
 Sakshi Wadhwani (17) told TOI, “We were more active on Instagram and Snap Chat rather than face to face communication. Thanks to the seminar, we are now actively participating in group conversations. ”
