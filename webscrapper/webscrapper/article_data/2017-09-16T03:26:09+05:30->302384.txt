NAVI MUMBAI: The number of children found   on city streets has increased, say citizens and activists.

  While the city cops do not seem to be taking necessary action against those pushing minors into begging, social workers have been blaming the lack of awareness drives. 
 
 “I have noticed an alarming increase in the number of child beggars under New Panvel flyover and at   close to MGM hospital. Those who live under bridges and flyovers are making their own kids beg at traffic signals. They come from villages only to earn through begging. This is tragic as the children are not getting any school education,” said Panvel activist Vishnu Gavali.
 
 Pastor Biju Samuel of New Panvel’s SEAL ashram said many motorists are seen giving alms to the children and this boosts the begging racket. “These kids also have the Right To Education but due to lack of family support they are pushed into begging. I have seen some kids addicted to inhalers like ink erasers and petrol soaked in cloth.” 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police of Navi Mumbai crime branch   said places where children are being forced to beg in the city will be raided.
