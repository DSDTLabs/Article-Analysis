Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday allowed the forest department to issue fresh order on tranquillizing   (T-17), who is dangerously moving in the human habitat along with her four cubs coming under Brahmapuri forest division.

 While disposing of the PIL by activist Swanand Soni, a division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Arun Upadhye directed the department to consult with the petitioner before issuing fresh order to tranquillize and capture the beast.
 
 Earlier, the forest department issued orders to tranquillize her with cubs on March 20 and shift her to forests, after villagers lodged many complaints. They cited that tigress was terrorizing the nearby villages and had killed a couple of their domestic animals. It becomes difficult for them to move out freely due to her presence in the area.
 
 Soni then filed a PIL contending that the department’s move may disturb her cubs and there were chances that they may get separated from the family. The HC had then granted a stay on the department’s orders.
 
 On Wednesday, the department, through counsel Mehroz Pathan, pointed out that its earlier order had expired and, therefore, the petition becomes infructuous. The court granted green signal to them to issue a fresh order.
