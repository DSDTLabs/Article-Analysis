AURANGABAD: After the state   drew a blank while looking out for inmates who jumped   or furlough, the department has decided to introduce complete   before their release.

 “Taking into account the high number of convicts jumping parole or furlough, we have shot off a communication to jail authorities to release the inmates only after a complete mapping is done,“ Maharashtra DGP Satish Mathur said, The state police chief has asked the prison authorities to record all biometric details of the inmates, including their iris scan, to identify them in case of any eventuality or untoward situation.
 
 The DGP's directives also include recording the antecedents of the inmates, contact numbers of their kin and their addresses.
 
 The inmates' latest photographs and identification marks on the body have to be checked and recorded before granting them on parole.
 
 The prison authorities are planning to publish the inmates' latest photographs at regular intervals in local dailies till the time they are out on parole.
 
 A senior officer with the prison department said, “If things go according to plan, the inmates getting parole or furlough may have a GPS-enabled tag on the body before their parole please is sanctioned. Some companies having expertise in the field have been contacted for the purpose.“
 
 The police department, along with the Maharashtra government, was left red-faced a few months ago when it submitted a report to the Bombay high court, stating that 672 prisoners had jumped parole till September 2016.
 
 As an immediate solution, the police units across the state formed special squads to trace these suspects.
