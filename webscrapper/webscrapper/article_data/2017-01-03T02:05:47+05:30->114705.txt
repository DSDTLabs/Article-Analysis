NEW DELHI: The delay in guideline for   admissions has left parents baffled. Schools say they have received several queries regarding the availability of forms, but are having to turn them away as they are still awaiting instructions.

 Sources said the EWS guidelines are being delayed because the government wants to release the circulars for both EWS admissions and admissions to private schools on DDA land together. “The government is serious about the issue as the high court will be video-taping the draw of lots. So the authorities are taking their time to go through the due process,” said a source.
 
 Senior officials in the department of education said that the EWS guidelines are expected to be out next week.
 
 Lawyer-activist   said EWS admissions this year are expected to be riddled with issues. “EWS admissions are mostly for those living in cluster houses and slums. But these colonies are usually not properly mapped. A majority of applicants will be informed by SMS, but several schools do not have this facility,” he said.
 
 Schools, however, are waiting for the guidelines. “A number of parents were upset on why the EWS forms, along with general category ones, were not being given,” said Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School.
