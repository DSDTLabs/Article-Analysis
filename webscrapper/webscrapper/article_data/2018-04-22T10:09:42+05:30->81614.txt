NAGPUR: From operating on a wooden table with table tennis lights hung over the head for conducting surgeries 25 years back at   in   tribal belt, the doctors of the   of Nagpur South Dist 3030 now have come a long way in serving the Korku tribals.

 They have a start-of-art operation theatre with six operating tables, two anaesthesia machines, auditorium etc where not just surgeons from Nagpur and India perform the surgeries but now surgeons from world over come to learn surgeries for the world surgeons, especially in thyroid surgery.
 
 The journey which began in 1992 as a small makeshift diagnostic camp has now reached its peak. The camps have benefited men, women, children from the tribal belt and changed the lifestyle of the Korkus. They now understand their rights. They know importance of education, healthy food and clean water. The villages now have over 2,000 solar lights, all thanks to the Nagpur doctors.
 
 The two annual camps have generated two major books for the ENT surgeons. One of them the thyroid Atlas has attracted wide acceptance. A book, ‘Surgery of Trismus in Oral Sub Mucous Fibrosis’, published by Springer Publications is being used worldwide.
 
 The club is celebrating its silver jubilee on Sunday at Chitnavis centre at 6pm. The Maharashtra forest and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar will be the chief guest at the function.
