Rattled by the scale of defeat in the Maharashtra local body elections, the   leadership is likely to call a meeting of state leaders to discuss measures to stem the erosion of the party base. Sources said Congress’s former chief ministers, former and current state unit chiefs and other senior leaders will be part of the stock-taking exercise, amid fears that the one-time bastion is slipping from the party’s hands. They not only suffered a drubbing in the BMC— where it won 31 of the 227 seats—but were also swept aside in other city bodies. The defeat coincided with massive gains for arch-rival  . 

 As a desperate measure, Congress and   have decided to join hands to helm zilla parishads where they jointly have the majority.
 
 The meeting in the capital is likely to focus on how the party lost its base so rapidly after having ruled Maharashtra virtually unchallenged for five decades. While the state unit blames “infighting”, the defeat is seen as evidence of an atrophying local leadership, worsened by a BJP on the upswing. That BJP has single-handedly matched its ally   in Mumbai and decimated it in the rest of state is seen as an ominous sign. The push from a section of the Congress to ally with Shiv Sena in the city is being seen as a diversionary tactic to hide their failures. Sources said there was little likelihood of the Congress embracing Sena as the alliance would have consequences for its ideological positioning.
