KOLKATA: A 14-year-old, who was returning with his mother to their   home in a rickshaw on Saturday night, was run over by a speeding vehicle when it tried to flee after knocking them down. The teenager had returned from school hostel barely hours before to spend the weekend with his family. While the boy,  , died at a hospital, his mother   is still battling for life with eight fractures on her ribs. 

 The incident took place around 9pm. Rupa, who had lost her mobile, asked her son to accompany her to   PS. After lodging the complaint, they took an autorickshaw from Sonarpur to   station, from where they took a rickshaw for home. They were hardly 500 metres from their home, when a speeding vehicle hit them from behind. As a result, both fell on the middle of the road. 
 
 As they lay on the ground, the vehicle swerved to its right. While doing so, it ran over Sudipto. The vehicle then hit a tree. Locals took the duo to a private hospital off EM Bypass. Later at night, the boy died. His mother regained consciousness on Sunday. Police have seized the vehicle and arrested its driver.
