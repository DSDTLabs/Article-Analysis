CHENNAI: In a clear bid to send out a signal that she has taken charge and also to seek endorsement of her elevation as AIADMK general secretary,   on Monday said she will meet functionaries at the party headquarters from 4 to January 9. In a party press release signed by her, the first after taking charge on Saturday, Sasikala said, “I have taken charge as AIADMK general secretary with the blessings of 'idhaya theivam puratchi thalaivi  ' (the god residing in my heart, revolutionary leader Amma).“ TNN Sasikala would hold meetings with district town and village-level functionaries, constituency-wise general council members, district-wise MPs and MLAs and district heads of the various party wings.

 She directed all functionaries to attend the meeting “without fail“.Starting with Chennai and Tiruvallur districts on January 4, she will hold meetings daily until January 9, except on January 5.
 
 At the party headquarters on Saturday, after accepting the post of general secretary, Sasikala made it clear the AIADMK would be run with the same military discipline like under J Jayalalithaa. In the evening, chief minister  , ministers, several MLAs and senior partymen gathered at the   residence where Sasikala unveiled a huge portrait of her friend and paid homage.
 
 While the clamour for her to take over the AIADMK and the administration culminated in the party entrusting her with the responsibility of general secretary on December 31, it is only a matter of time before she is sworn in chief minister, say party leaders.On Monday , senior leader and Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambidurai called for to be sworn into the top post. State revenue minister   offered to resign from his Thirumangalam constituency in Madurai to enable her to contest from the thevar-dominated district.
