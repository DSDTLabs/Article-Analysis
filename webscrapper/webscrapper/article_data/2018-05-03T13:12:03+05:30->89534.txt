PUNE: The Pune rural police on Wednesday arrested a teacher from a privately run junior college for   from his student to get marks and pass the examination.

 An offence was registered under section 354-A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code. The teacher was produced before the court on Wednesday and has been remanded in judicial custody. 
 
 An officer from the   police told TOI that the complainant is a first-year commerce student from a private college. The suspect is a teacher from the same college. “A few days ago, the suspect had tried to lure the student by telling her that he would help her get marks and also clear her examination,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said the student ignored it, initially. “However, for the past few days, the teacher had been calling her and demanding sexual favours from her,” the officer said.
 
 The terrified student informed her parents about it. She also recorded the teacher’s conversation on her cellphone. With the help of the members of a parents’ organisation, the student’s parents approached the police and lodged a complaint against the teacher, the officer said.
