COIMBATORE: DMK working president   on Saturday urged party workers to avoid extravagant  .
In an appeal to the cadres on Sunday, Stalin said the party would win the support of the people when it shuns indiscriminate use of flex boards and banners. Instead, cadres could hoist as many party flags as possible, he urged. It is a must to avoid erection of banners on roads, he said.
 
 Incidentally, Stalin's statement comes a day before the birthday of his elder brother  , with whom he has a long running power struggle. January 30 has always been celebrated by Alagiri supporters wih much pomp and show in Madurai.
 
 Invariably, his supporters would turn every available space on the walls of the city into canvas to paint the former southern strongman's portrait.
 
 Larger than life images of Alagiri would adorn ev ery road in Madurai as the event would turn into an occasion for show of strength for his suporters, even after his dismissal from the party .
 
 This year though, Alagiri has kept a very low profile.Alagiri supporters said that they don't intend to make a grand extravaganza on Sunday. “Alagiri has asked us not to make his birthday a celebration as thalaivar (M  ) was not keeping well,'' said one of his supporters.
 
 Around the same time last year too, DMK headquarters issued a statement asking cadres to shun indiscriminate posters and banners, which again was seen as an instruction to Alagiri supporters.
 
 Stalin, however, made no reference to Alagiri or his birthday bash. “When I visited Coimbatore recently , there were a number of banners all along the route I travelled. Though it was heartening to see the love of cadres in those posters and banners, they shouldn't invite disgust from public,'' he said in the state.
