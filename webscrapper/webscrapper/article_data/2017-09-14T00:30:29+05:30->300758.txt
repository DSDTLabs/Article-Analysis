NAVI MUMBAI: The Panvel civic body will table its   tax   for all the nodes, including Kharghar, in the next general body meeting. The uniform   currently levied in the defunct   area will be abolished. 

 Property tax will now be based on the ready reckoner rate which will increase the tax burden in the days to come in developed nodes. 
 
  corporator Paresh Thakur said, “The upcoming property tax proposal will try to balance the tax rate based on the ready reckoner. The tax rate in the defunct PMC area remains same everywhere irrespective of the higher rate of ready reckoner value difference in different places of old Panvel.” 
 
 Those staying in posh areas pay almost the same tax as those in backward areas, he said. 
 
 “This needs to be balanced. Accordingly, the tax will be more in posh areas and less in villages based on the ready reckoner values,” Thakur added.
 
 Since residents of Cidco nodes were not paying the property tax and the tax in grampanchayat areas was less, the Panvel municipal corporation has decided to do a balancing act while computing tax for all the areas, so as to ensure that it was not unfair on residents of any area.
