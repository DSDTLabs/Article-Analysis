Ahmedabad: A 32-year-old student of nursing has accused her  ,  , of   and sending lewd messages on her mobile. She also alleged that the professor, on study tour to Bangalore in February 2017, tried to touch her and others on the pretext of asking them to massage oil into his hair.

  The victim alleged that four other girls also were victimized by the professor. According to Shahibaug police station officials, the girls also alleged that the professor would drink alcohol and misbehave with them.
 
 “This is not the first time the professor has been accused of molestation. Some 10 months ago the girls had complained to the management of Civil Hospital Nursing College, but the professor was let off by the management with a warning,” added a police official.
 
 Police officials said the girl alleged that Mackwan sent them ‘kiss’ emoji on their mobiles. “The next morning, when the girl spoke to the professor about his messages, the professor told them not take his messages seriously, especially those sent in the evening,” added a police official.
 
 Inspector of Shahibaug police station V N Yadav said they registered a complaint under section 354 for molestation, 509 for criminal intimidation and under the IT Act for sending lewd messages.
 
 “We have formed two teams to find the professor as the victim is not aware of his address. We sent a team to the nursing college to get his address,” added Yadav.
 
 The principal of the nursing college   said that after the girls complained to the management about the professor’s behaviour, they wrote to Shahibaug police to take action against him.
 
 Sanadiya added they had received such complaints about the professor earlier. “A committee was formed to probe the allegations but as all the committee members were junior to the professor, no action was taken against him. As such, the earlier allegations were hearsay too,” Sanadiya added.
