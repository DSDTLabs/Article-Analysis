KURUKSHETRA:   power engineers criticized the ‘arbitrary transfer policy’ of the state government.   ( ) stated on Tuesday that they were perturbed over the non-acceptance of their long pending demands. They said the power utilities’ management had failed to grant a meeting with the power engineers’ association to discuss their problems for the last about six months.

 HPEA, in its executive meeting held on Tuesday at  , condemned the transfer policy, alleging it had been formed to divide the engineers. “The transfer policy does not allow rotation of all engineers but pick and chose policy had been made to favor their blue-eyed engineers,” the association stated.
 
 It said the persons working in the field were not allowed to opt for head office posts and vice versa. The field engineers had been forced to remain in the field and it was a violation of natural justice, HPEA said.
 
 The association condemned the “arbitrariness in allocating marks in the guise of policy”. General secretary of the association K K Malik said there was no base for assessing the individual performance as the marks were given in an arbitrary way.
 
 The association welcomed the acceptance of its demand for revival of the post of engineer-in-chief in discoms (distribution companies). However, the abnormal delay in the promotions of engineers at various levels was an issue and promotions should be made immediately as and when a vacancy arose, the association said.
