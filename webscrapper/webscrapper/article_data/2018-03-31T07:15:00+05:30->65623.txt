CHANDIGARH: The stand-off between the representatives of panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and the Haryana government took a new turn on Friday, with the   offices in  , Gohana in   district and Fatehabad, Ratia, Tohana and Bhatu Kalan in Fatehabad district remaining locked.

 The panchayati raj institutions’ representatives were agitating against the suspension of nine gram sachivs, who allegedly accompanied protesting sarpanchs and panchs for a negotiation meeting with the government in Chandigarh.
 
 The row has its roots in protest here by panchs and sarpanchs, who were opposing the e-tendering and computerization of panchayati raj department across the state. As a result, road connecting Chandigarh to Panchkula remanded blocked for over six hours before the officials in the chief minister’s office convened a meeting with the agitating elected members of panchayat.
 
 Gram sachivs who were placed under suspension included Naresh Dhankar, president of the association from Rohtak, Ajit Singh of Hisar,   of Sampla, Satpal Singh of NArwana, Sultan Singh of Safidon, Narender of   and Mahesh Kumar from Morni and   of Nuh.
 
 According to information, the   representatives had sought the withdrawal of decision as all panchayats don’t have effective internet system and most of the representatives and staff of the department were not computer literate.
