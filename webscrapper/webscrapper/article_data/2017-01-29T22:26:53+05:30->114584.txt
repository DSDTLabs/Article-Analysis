Oscar-winning actor   says that he is absolutely fine with the constant spotlight on his life, but gets bothered when his children's personal space is invaded. 

  
  
 The 44-year-old star shares a cordial bond with his estranged wife  , with whom he has two daughters Violet, 10, Seraphina, seven, and four-year-old son Samuel. 
 
 Affleck, who recently made headlines for his highly-publicised split from Garner, said he always tries to protect his kids from the public eye.
 "You become a public figure and it changes all the rules. The press can become invasive and dishonest, and you have to put up with inconvenient stuff like that. 
 
 "I'm at peace with paying my own price, what I'm not at peace with is when it invades on my kids' space and time. They didn't make any bargains. I try to shelter them as best I can. That's my only real gripe," he said.
