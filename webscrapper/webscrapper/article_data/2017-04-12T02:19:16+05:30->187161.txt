KOLKATA: A flash protest by students of a private school in Cossipore turned ugly on Tuesday morning with cops being gheraoed, allegation of a drunk policeman punching a protester and even a dramatic motorcycle rescue of the accused cop by his colleagues barely 300 metres from the police station. All this, while the school principal refused to come out of the Cossipore OC’s office, claiming she might get mobbed by both media and parents. The police finally managed to bring order with the school authority agreeing to resolve matters. By then, the OC’s office has been occupied for more than an hour.

 The students were protesting against “absence of teachers, a crumbling teacher-student ratio, claims of exams being cancelled without any proper reason and even a host of allegations against a relatively new principal”.
 
 According to police, students of the school — located close to the Cossipore Haldiram’s — had assembled at 8am, only to realize their exam had been cancelled. The students alleged the principal was acting whimsically, forcing several teachers of the school, including those working for over a decade or two, to either resign or stop attending school. Though the principal was not in school, her office denied the allegations. It said: “This was an internal school matter and had nothing to do with students.”
 
 Around 9 am, ASI Sujoy Bhattacharya arrived even as the students continued the agitation. Two hours later, a former student Abhijit Yadav alleged he was heckled by an ASI. Within minutes, he was chased and sought shelter in a sweet shop 150m away. Hundreds gheraoed him claiming he was in an inebriated condition. DC (North)   later said, “Bhattacharya was not drunk, but was unable to express himself due to some illness and he had never reported to work in an inebriated condition.” The impasse was finally resolved around 1pm.
