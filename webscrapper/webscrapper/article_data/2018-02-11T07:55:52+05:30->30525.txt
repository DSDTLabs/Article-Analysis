CHENNAI: With Class   a little more than a month away, the   exempted 24 students of a government-aided school in   from writing the compulsory Tamil language paper.

 Citing earlier rulings of the court in the matter, a division bench of   and Justice MV   passed the order while allowing a PIL from minor C   and 23 other students of Shree GK Jain Higher Secondary School, Royapuram. Noting that they had studied Hindi in their primary education, the students said till 2015, there were no Tamil teachers in the school. 
 
 Only in 2016, did the school engage Tamil teachers, they said, adding that they ought to have been granted exemption from writing Tamil subject examinations. 
 
 The students wanted the court to quash an order passed by the chief educational officer dated November 7 and the consequential order of the disrict educational officer (Chennai-east) dated November 11, 2017 and consequently, to grant exemption from the implementation of   Compulsory Tamil Learning Act, 2006.
 
 The Bench, while referring to the high court’s ruling upholding the Tamil Nadu Tamil Learning Act, 2006, said it had then observed that the process of introduction of Tamil as compulsory language in part-I should be done in a phased manner from Class I to X so that a student who was taught Tamil from Class 1 was not over-burdened and could learn the Tamil language at ease. 
 
 “Taking into consideration the observations of this court, we are of the view that requiring students to take Tamil paper as a compulsory subject in the ensuing X standard examination would be unjustified.”
 
 The bench then quashed the order of the authorities and said, “petitioners are exempted from taking the Tamil examination in the coming 2017-18 Class X public examination.”
