 “Anantrai first offered to show him samples of diamonds of different shapes and sizes via a social messaging site, but Jain called him to Ahmedabad, offering a sure purchase. Jain fell into the trap and landed at the city airport with his friend on Sunday,” said a senior police official.
 
 According to a complaint lodged by Anantrai, Jain asked him to hire a cab and come straight to his shop. “In half an hour, Anantrai and his friend came to the shop and were impressed by the gold jewellery which, in fact, was fake,” said a police source.
 
 At Jain’s request, Anantrai showed him the diamonds. “Jain first checked the diamonds with his naked eye and then entered the partitioned room where he said a diamond-checking machine was kept,” said a police official.
 
 According to the complaint, Anantrai heard the sound of the machine for about 15 minutes before everything went silent. “Anantrai then got up and entered the partitioned area only to find the back door open and no sign of either the diamonds or Jain,” said a police official.
 
 On inquiring with the locals, Anantrai found that the shop was rented and the address given to the landlord also turned out to be fake. “Anantrai realized he had been cheated of diamonds worth Rs 15 lakh. Luckily, he had not given a second packet to Jain which contained diamonds worth Rs 45 lakh,” an investigator added.
 
 During their investigation, the cops found that the CCTV cameras in the showroom had no digital video recorders and were for show only. “We have activated our informers to get clues,” added a senior police official.
