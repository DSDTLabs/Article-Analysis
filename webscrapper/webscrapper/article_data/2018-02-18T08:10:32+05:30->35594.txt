TIRUPATI: In another face-off between   sleuths and red sanders smugglers deep in  ,   opened fire in the air when members of the smugglers gang pelted stones at them in an attempt to secure release of their accomplices in the early hours of Saturday. The sleuths confiscated 16 red sanders logs and nabbed five smugglers, while the others fled the place. 

 It all began when the Task Force team was conducting a combing operation in the area between   in the late hours of Friday. The Task Force team followed a trail of footprints left by the smugglers up to a certain distance. 
 
 They changed the strategy by combing the   area after discovering that the gang members had got the wind of the operation and erased their footprints. The smugglers fell victim to their own strategy as they lost their way after travelling some distance.
