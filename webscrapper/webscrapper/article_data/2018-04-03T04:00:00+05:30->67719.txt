Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stepped in for domestic   hit by bad loans and sliding bond prices at the same time, which is expected to severely dent their profits. On Monday, the   said lenders will be allowed to spread their losses, resulting from dipping prices of government securities (G-secs, or  ) over four quarters for the December 2017 and March 2018 quarters respectively. 

 This will permit banks to report lower losses in coming quarters and would also soften gilt yields, bond market players said. Meanwhile, the central bank asked lenders to build adequate reserves to protect against increase in yields in the future. “All banks are advised to create an investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) with effect from the year 2018-19,” the RBI said. 
 
 According to RBI data, as of March 23, lenders had a total investment of nearly Rs 33.5 lakh crore in gilts, of which nearly Rs 20 lakh crore is under held to maturity ( ). The balance of about Rs 11.5 lakh crore is held in available for sale (AFS) and held for trade (HFT) portfolios. Losses accrued under   and   during the two quarters, ended December 2017 and March 2018, could now be spread over four subsequent quarters, bond dealers said. This could also lead to some rally in bank stocks on Tuesday, they added.
 
 On Monday, the RBI said that to address “the systemic impact of sharp increase in the yields on government securities, it has been decided to grant banks the option to spread provisioning for mark to market (MTM) losses on investments held in AFS and HFT for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018”. Gilts classified under HTM are those which would not be traded in the market and would be held throughout the securities’ tenure. On the other hand, gilts under HFT and AFS could be traded at frequent intervals.
