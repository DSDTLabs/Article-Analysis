BENGALURU: Dropped from the Indian Test squad after the home series against Australia in March last year, middle-order batsman   is set to return to the India fold with the historic one-off Test match against Afghanistan starting in Bengaluru on June 14. The 26-year-old — who scored an epic unbeaten triple hundred (303 n.o) against England in December 2016 — has been drafted in as the sixth specialist batsmen in the Ajinkya Rahane-led India team.

 
 
 
 
 
 Rahane will stand in for skipper Virat Kohli — who will play county cricket for Surrey — in the run-up to the tour of England. Kohli will return to lead the side for the two T20 contests against Ireland on June 27 and 29 before India embark on a long tour. Also missing from the Test squad which toured South Africa recently are Rohit Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah.
 
 Pacer Ishant Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara — who are currently playing for Sussex and Yorkshire — will return to India for the Test against Afghanistan. In the pace section, Ishant will be joined by Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Shardul Thakur with all-rounder Hardik Pandya too in the mix.
 
 Speaking about the team, which was picked here on Tuesday along with four other teams, MSK Prasad, chairman of the senior selection committee, said: “Except Virat, the other Test specialists are playing this match. Virat is out so that he comes well-prepared for the England Test series. It is always good that he goes there and performs well and he is very keen. He himself wants to do well in English conditions. It is a great opportunity for us to win the series.”
 
 
 
 
 Thanks to his good domestic outing and red-hot form in the IPL,   has made it back to the Indian line-up after almost two years. The 32-year-old, who has scored 423 runs for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL so far, will travel to England as part of the ODI squad. Punjab pacer Siddharth Kaul too has been rewarded for his domestic performance. While Kedar Jadhav has been ruled out due to injury, another middle-order batsman, Manish Pandey, who features in the T20 squad, has been left out of the ODI team.
 
 Among those who missed the bus for the T20s against Ireland (two T20s) and England (three T20s) are Jaydev Unadkat — who featured in the Nidahas T20 tri-series in Sri Lanka — Axar Patel and Thakur. The selectors continued to show faith in Washington Sundar, who has had a rather ordinary IPL with the struggling Royal Challengers Bangalore.
 
 Rahane, meanwhile, will not travel to England for the limited overs tour while KL Rahul, who was dropped from the ODIs against South Africa, has made the squad in all the three formats. Suresh Raina is in only for the T20Is, though.

 IPL performances have been rewarded and some major reshuffling has taken place across formats as the selection committee announced five separate squads on Tuesday. TOI takes a look...
 
 • Ajinkya Rahane, who will lead India in the one-off Test against Afghanistan, doesn’t find a place in the England ODI and T20 squads.
 
 • Rohit Sharma has been ‘dropped’ from the Test squad, while Kuldeep Yadav makes a comeback.
 
 • Karun Nair, the sixth specialist batsman, earns a recall to the Test team after 15 months.
 
 • Shardul Thakur has got a Test berth, but lost his place in ODIs. He also finds a place in the India ‘A’ squad for one-day series against England Lions and West Indies ‘A’.
 
 • Ambati Rayudu, currently blazing the batting charts in the IPL, has made it to the ODI squads for England but failed to find a place in the T20I squad.
 
 • KL Rahul, who has been impressive in IPL-11, returns to the ODI squad after being dropped last August.
 
 • Manish Pandey, who has been unimpressive in the ongoing IPL, has been left out of ODIs but retains his place in the T20I squad.
 
 • Sunrisers bowler Siddharth Kaul, who has impressed in IPL-11, finds a place in both the ODI and T20I squads.
 
 • Ashwin, Jadeja expectedly find a place in the Test squad but not in any other squad.
