THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   has written to Union minister for railways   to begin new trains from other zones to Kerala. "Due to the negligent attitude of some railway officials, Kerala did not get any new trains from the railway board timetable committee that met in Mumbai," said Vijayan. 

 The Jabalpur-Thiruvananthapuram train demand did not fructify, but the train was given to Tamil Nadu by diverting it to Tirunelveli. Another request for a train to Thiruvananthapuram via Kottayam from east-central railway was rejected. The other demands were to increase the frequency of Kochuveli Bikaner weekly train to three days a week and operation of Kochuveli-Lokmanya Tilak Express as a daily train.
 
 He alleged that railway officials cited the shortage of space at   station to deny new trains to the state. 
 
 "The stand taken by certain southern railway officials went against the state's interest. Passengers depend on trains for long-distance journey and Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad divisions are earning good revenue. Taking these factors into consideration, railways should increase the frequency of trains to the state and allot more trains to Kerala," he said. TNN
