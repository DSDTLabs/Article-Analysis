Coimbatore: A team of researchers from the Bharathiar University has successfully produced light absorbing graphene - a form of two-dimensional carbon the thickness of which is just a few atoms - in a cost effective method. 

 Graphene is a two-dimensional material made of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb like structure. It has good electrical and thermal conductivity, strong chemical stability and high mechanical strength, all of which arise from its two-dimensional nature. Graphene is believed to possess potential to drive the future technology by revolutionising material sciences.
 
 If graphene has to be used as light absorbing material in solar cells, it must be prepared with ‘band gap’ which is essentially a semiconducting property. But inducing the property in graphene is a challenging task, the release said. The researchers, led by Devaraj Nataraj of physics department, have successfully produced a new form of graphene, in which they were able to see intrinsic light absorption and emission properties, it said. tnn
