NASHIK: The city witnessed around 60% voting for the   (NMC) elections on Tuesday, which was marginally better than the 57% polling in the last civic elections in 2012. 

 Political experts said many voters' names had been struck off the  , else the voting percentage could have been higher.
 
 Municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna told TOI that around 10.73 lakh citizens cast their votes this time as against around 10 lakh in 2012. 
 
 The experts said the voting pattern and the changed equations over the last few years in the NMC indicate a close fight for power between the   and the BJP, with the former having the advantage.
 
 Medha Saykhedkar, who has a doctorate in political science, said the names of nearly 15% voters had been struck off the electoral rolls. Saykhedkar said the current mood in Nashik pointed to gains for the Sena. "It is going to be a close call between the Sena and the BJP. CM Fadnavis' statement of the BJP adopting Nashik was not forceful enough to create an impact. Besides, the BJP candidates did not have a connect with the voters. MNS could gain votes in their traditional strongholds," she added.
