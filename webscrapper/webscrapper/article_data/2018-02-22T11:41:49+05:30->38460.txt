PANAJI: The state’s department of fisheries is looking to adopt Udupi’s successful model of house-to-house cage fish farming. 

 Initially, about a hundred 4mx4m sized cages will be set up. Locals will be able to install these cages in their yards and begin fish culture.
 
 While the practice of raising selected fish in enclosures in the open sea has been going on for the last few years at Polem and reservoir culture is on at Chapoli dam, the new model will look at involving people other than fish farmers to raise fish for self-consumption and even sale, if there is excess production.
 
 “With this, there will be less dependency on the market and people can go for local species. Technical and financial assistance will be provided by the department,” said fisheries secretary  . The National Fisheries Development Board ( ) has agreed to provide help in this regard, he said.
 
 “Local species of fresh water fish will be more feasible for this experiment. Seeds and feed for the same will procured from NFDB and Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Every block in Goa will be provided with the opportunity,” he said.
