GURUGRAM: A 42-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide in her flat in Sector 56 on Saturday following a quarrel with her husband.

 Anita Singh was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room when the couple’s son and the security guard of the flat broke open the door, police said. Anita’s husband Mahavir Singh, the chief manager of a Canara Bank branch in Chandigarh, was arrested on Sunday following a complaint by the couple’s son, Himangshu.
 
 A case of abetment to suicide has been brought against Singh.
 
 A police officer said Himagshu had mentioned in the complaint that his parents would often fight over trivial matters. Himansghu, who lived in Chandigarh and came home to Gurgaon on weekends, got into a fight with Anita on Saturday over whether they should visit his ancestral house in Manesar, the complaint said. Singh allegedly abused and beat up Anita, following which she locked herself in her room. 
 
 “We heard from neighbours that the husband would trouble the woman often. We are going through their call recordings,” a police officer said.
 
 Himagshu reportedly told the police that when his mother did not open the door despite repeated knocks, he went down and called the security guard. After they broke open the door, Anita was found hanging with her dupatta. She was taken to the hospital, where she was declared dead.
 
 The couple’s daughter Ankita, who works in Pune, arrived home on Sunday morning after getting the news of her mother’s death and corroborated what Himanshu had told the police, officers claimed.
 
 The police said a post-mortem of Anita’s body would be done on Monday by a medical board. The family lived in the high-rise Hiva apartments in Sector 56.
 
 “We have arrested Mahavir Singh on the basis of the complaint made by the couple’s son,” said the SHO of Sector 56 police station, Arvind Kumar.
