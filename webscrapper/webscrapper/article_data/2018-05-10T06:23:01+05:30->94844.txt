AHMEDABAD: Gandhinagar could soon be deprived of the shrill bird calls of the blue-cheeked bee-eaters (Merops persicus), if the wanton excavation along the Sabarmati banks behind Indroda Fort does not stop. 

 A large habitat and nesting site of these birds is along the sandy banks and embankments of the Sabarmati and these are literally being scooped out by sand miners.
 
 Tractor trailers frequently visit the spot, which is just a few hundred metres behind the ministerial enclave and governor’s bungalow. 
 
 Birding enthusiasts like Snehal Shah posted pictures on social media of the birds busy building their nests despite the mining activity around them. 
 
 The nests are one to two metres deep and end in a large incubation chamber, in the sides of the muddy embankments. The breeding season of the blue-cheeked bee-eater is from March to June. They generally breed in loose colonies. The birds at one location, lay eggs within three weeks of each other, say experts.
 
 “Many avid birders visit the Sabarmati banks below Indroda Fort to witness the nesting of these birds. The bee-eaters are in pairs throughout the breeding and nesting period and make beautiful bird calls. The forest department should intervene to save the birds habitat and check whether the mining is being legally carried or not,” says naturalist Haseeb Sheikh.
