ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad   on Monday directed the UP   to conduct an inquiry into awarding of identical marks to a few of the successful candidates in the recruitment examination for 122 posts of assistant engineer. 
 
 The court has also directed the nigam to consider, within six weeks, objections raised by the candidates regarding incorrect answer keys to some of the questions asked in the written examination.
 
 Disposing of a writ petition filed by one Subham   of Kanpur Dehat, Justice AP   and Justice   made it clear that the appointments already made on these posts will be subject to the outcome of the inquiry conducted by the nigam.
 
 The petitioner's contention was that appointment letters to successful candidates in recruitment examination for the post of assistant engineers were issued in February 2017 and thereafter the answer key and answer sheets were released online. After perusing the answer key and answer sheets, the petitioner found that a few of the successful candidates had got equal marks by giving identical answers correctly.
 
 According to the petitioner, even wrong answers given by these successful candidates were identical. Counsel for UP Jal Nigam filed an affidavit of RP Sinha, chairman of recruitment committee, in which it was said that objections raised against wrong answer keys had been sent to the agency conducting the examination.
