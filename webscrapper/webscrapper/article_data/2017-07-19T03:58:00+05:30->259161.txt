Panaji/Candolim/Colva: The invasion of blue bottle   on many of Goa’s popular coastlines — Baga-Sinquerim, Benaulim-Cavelossim, Anjuna, and Morjim — threw tourists’ plans out of gear as many abstained from swimming and approaching the surf zone out of fear of being stung.

 The Baga-Sinquerim beach was the worst hit, as the high incidence of jellyfish blooms washing up on the popular stretch made swimming extremely difficult. While swimming is not favourable during monsoon, tourists are allowed in certain ‘restricted’ areas.
 
 Drishti Lifesaving, the state-appointed professional lifeguard agency advised tourists and locals to keep away from the water, as the toxic sting of the lurking blue bottle jellyfish (Physalia utriculus), also called   Man-of-War, could leave the victim in pain for hours due to their toxicity. 
 
 Some of the jellyfish found in Candolim were less than an inch in size, but even dead ones can deliver a sting.
