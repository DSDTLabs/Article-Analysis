BENGALURU: When   walked into the prematch press conference, he wore a smile that lit up his face. He grinned throughout the 12-minute interaction on Thursday and was relaxed. Ready for his first game of the   season, the home skipper spoke on the lessons from the break and the match ahead. 
 

 
 
 I got hit on the 16th (last month) so it's almost been a month. It's never a good feeling when you have played seven-eight years without missing a game. I am delighted to be back and excited to take the field. Time away reignites that spark in you. When you play a lot of cricket, that tends to go down. Luckily it's stayed.
 
 
 
 
 During the course of a big series, you go into a zone. Sometimes you think in hindsight, 'maybe I could have done things differently, handled myself differently.' You understand what's important for the team. I learnt a lot from that phase, as a captain, individual and person. I wouldn't say I will be disappointed if the attention is on me again, because I am used to it. I will handle it better than I have in the past and not necessarily take too much of a load onto myself. The last few weeks have been irritating as far as going on to the field is concerned... It will make me stronger and I will know how to handle it better.
 
 
 
 
 I stayed back in Bengaluru to work on strengthening my shoulder. I wanted to let the guys focus on their game and work on the sidelines. I enjoyed it a bit.
 
 
 
 
 Chris has always been a priority. The last game was a scenario when AB came in,   was the captain and other two guys were bowling well. It was difficult to leave three of the others out. (Selecting) AB is a no-brainer so Chris was left out. In Bengaluru, we will go in with the strongest possible combination and Chris is a big contender for the home games.
