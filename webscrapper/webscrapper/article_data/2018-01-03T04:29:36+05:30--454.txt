Singer-actor   finds actor   an "amazing team player".

 
  
 According to a report, Nick said Black made their screen kiss in the movie   easy.
 
 "It was important for the story. We did have to do quite a few takes but Jack is an amazing team player. He and I really connected. He loves a good meal, as do I, so we ventured out to some of local spots on Oahu,  , where we were shooting," Jonas said.
 
 Unlike the original, the new film follows four high school teenagers who discover an old video game console and are transported into the game's jungle setting, becoming the adult avatars they chose.
 
 The four must work together to survive in the jungle and beat the game in order to return to the real world or they will be stuck forever.
 
 The sequel was shot on site in the Hawaiian jungle and Jonas said it was the same location where   was filmed.
