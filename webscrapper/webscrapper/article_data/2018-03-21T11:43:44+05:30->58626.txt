 Shakespeare had famously said, “What’s in a name?” But   from   would have strongly disagreed with the literary giant. I have not yet had the pleasure to actually meet Salma, however, I know her very well through  , our domestic help.
 
 
 Roopa was married to Salma’s son, Sooraj, years ago, before she realised that life as a divorcee is better than a life of domestic abuse camouflaged with an elaborate facade of red bangles and shiny vermilion. After her marriage, Salma gave Roopa clear instructions, that she was not supposed to take her husband’s name. One year flew by without uttering ‘Sooraj’. Casual waving of the hand, innocuous sounds, the very Bollywood ‘sunte ho’ was replaced by ‘Disha ke papa’, when she gave birth to a baby girl. A coterie of kids followed, but for the sake of convenience,   remained only ‘Disha ke papa’! Everything was hunky dory, till Roopa decided to make casual conversation with the mother-in-law about the weather. ‘Aaj Sooraj bohat tez hai, garmi hai’, she remarked nonchalantly. Salma did not take to this kindly! How dare the daughter-in-law utter her son’s name? So what if she was referring to the sun! Roopa was packed off to her parents’, where she spent the next few weeks in punishment. This pattern went on for nearly a decade, till Roopa decided to rise above her meekness and take charge of her life. Now, there are so many   out there, making life torturous for so many Roopas, while all the Soorajs stand and witness the injustice being meted out, is dispiriting. This just shows that proper education and exposure is capable of creating and shaping us into wonderful, empathetic human beings. The lack of either, or worse, both, is equally capable of turning us humans into monsters!
