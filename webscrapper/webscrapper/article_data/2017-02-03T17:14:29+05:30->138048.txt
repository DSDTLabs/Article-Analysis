NEW DELHI: In a bid to clear the air on airline punctuality, the   ( ) is likely to recommend full automatisation of on time performance (OTP) recording mechanism at airports. The regulator is currently studying the process of recording OTP at Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad – the four places from where the figures are taken to see how punctual an airline’s domestic operations are – after getting complaints from a carrier about the monitoring system.

 “These four metros have 375 boardings areas in all. Of these, 36% record the exact time of an aircraft arriving or departing electronically using the visual docking guidance system. These other are remote bays which record the arrival and departure time manually.   aircraft have a system where this time s captured and relayed electronically to the airport operator. All   planes do not have this,” said a senior DGCA official.
 
 During random sampling, the DGCA found that sometimes planes which arrive or depart 15 minutes after their schedule time – and being categorised late or not on time – can be shown to have flown in or out on time with manual intervention. For instance, two employees at Mumbai airport were found to have tampered this data.
 
 “We have studied the US, Australian and British system of monitoring OTP. The data collection there is automatic with little or no human intervention. We are looking at recommending that model in India too,” said the official.
 
 The regulator’s report is expected by end of this month. “The OTP data is collected by the airport operators at the four metros and then released by us after which it is known as government or DGCA data on OTP. Therefore we have to ensure that the same is fully correct,” the official added.
 
 Punctuality is a major deciding factor for passengers when it comes to choosing an airline.
