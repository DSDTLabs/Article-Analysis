NAGPUR: Introduction of   (BTT) and abolishment of the current   will prove to be revolutionary should the government implement it, said economist  , on Wednesday.

 He was delivering a lecture on Arthakranti chairman Anil Bokil’s concept of Indian economy. The lecture was organized by Akshari Mitra Mandal at Jyeshth Nagarik Mandal Hall in Narendra Nagar.
 
 Paraskar’s lecture largely focused on Arthakranti’s study of the economy which led to Bokil’s recommendation to the government to demonetise specified bank notes (SBNs).
 
 He began with the prescribed condition of the nation’s economy post-independence. Paraskar said, “In 1947, the Nehru government declared that the economy will be mixed. Until 1992, the economy was struggling to keep up with the rest of the world which is why the then Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao took a bold step to open up the economy to globalization and invited foreign investment.”
 
 “But thanks to complex taxation and weak banking systems,   was being created as people managed to take advantage of the loopholes ingrained in the system and evaded direct taxes. This is where the study of Bokil and his teams of economists came into picture,” Paraskar said.
 
 “Bokil’s study suggested that too much liquidity and proportionately less available credit in the system was a major reason behind black money creation,” he said.
 
 “In the 2014-15 fiscal, currency in circulation was Rs9.8 lakh crores and available bank credit in the form of cheques, demand drafts, etc., was Rs8.8 lakh crore. This is not the case in developed economies where bank credit is 4 to 5 times more than the liquidity, as per Bokil’s study,” the economist said.
 
 He too believed that the new system will be enough to meet the nation’s revenue demands in the future.
