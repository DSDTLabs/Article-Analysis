AHMEDABAD: The brand new edition of   is all set to be back with a bang on Sabarmati riverfront on Sunday below   between 6am to 9:30am. Get out of your lazy beds, grab that tracksuit, slip into your joggers and the yoga gear and head straight to the west promenade near Paldi. Witness Gujaratâ€™s longest running place making project, a mission to sustain our public spaces to build stronger communities.

 
  Join the exhilarating   conducted by Ruth Gabriel, bicycle on the riverfront stretch, skate or play some street games. If you are fitness freak there is Mac Fitness to consult. If you are one of those talented budding musicians, bring your street band to Happy Streets and let the crowd cheer you. Children get a chance to make new friends and so do parents. You could even volunteer to teach others a few important Yoga exercises or share your expertise and ideas with others on how to improve neighborhoods or begin a new green or cleanliness drive. You could also raise awareness on traffic safety or help suggest ways of taking care of our environment. The possibilities are endless, so do join us this Sunday at Happy Streets.
