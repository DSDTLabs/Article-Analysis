SRINAGAR: A crowd of miscreants threw stones at an   patrol in  , Budgam district, on Friday afternoon, and hurled a firecracker towards the Armymen. The soldiers, who mistook the bang of the cracker for a grenade, responded with gunfire, wounding two youths, Tanveer Ahmad and Ibrahim Wani.

 Tanveer, 22, succumbed to injuries at a hospital while Ibrahim was undergoing treatment, the police said. J&K police have registered a case against the counter-insurgency 53 Rashtriya Rifles unit in connection with the killing, police sources said.
 
 The violence was triggered by separatists asking people to observe a shutdown and march to the UN observers’ office to protest against “frequent killings of civilians”.
 
 Police said an Army patrol was stoned at Beerwah.
 
 “Someone among the miscreants also hurled a firecracker towards the Armymen. Because of the ‘bang’, the soldiers thought a grenade had been hurled and they retaliated,” police added.
 
 However, locals alleged that a few stones were hurled from somewhere towards the soldiers who opened fire and killed Tanveer, a tailor, near his shop. They said soldiers came down from the Sumo stand at Beerwah, thrashing everybody on the way. This, they said, was followed by youths throwing a a few stones at the soldiers. They alleged that the soldiers then opened fire.
 
 There was partial shutdown in the Valley — the situation in several areas was normal, barring curfew in downtown areas, police said. Thousands participated on Friday in the funeral prayers for Tanveer. Multiple funeral prayers were offered at his native Beerwah in central Kashmir, reports said.
 
 Sources in Kashmir said clashes erupted soon after the funeral prayers. Reports said the forces fired tear gas shells at mourners when his body was taken for burial. Police sources said people threw stones at the soldiers and they retaliated with tear gas shells.
