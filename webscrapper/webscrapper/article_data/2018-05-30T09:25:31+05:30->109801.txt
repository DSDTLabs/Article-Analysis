SHANGHAI: A   flight from China to Vietnam was forced to turn around after cracks appeared in a window, Chinese state media reported on Wednesday.

 Beijing-based Capital Airlines, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, and Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 
 Earlier this month, a Sichuan Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after a cockpit window blew out.
 
 Also in May, a Southwest Airlines plane made an emergency landing after a window pane cracked in flight.
