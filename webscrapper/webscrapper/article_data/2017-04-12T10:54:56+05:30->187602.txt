PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation has so far been able to tag 1.5 lakh properties with the geographical information system (GIS) since it started the work five months back.

 GIS mapping will help highlight encroachment on open plots. Continuous monitoring can expose unauthorised constructions. The administration can also keep track of the current status of amenity spaces.
 
 PMC officials said that the project started in November 2016. The first phase ended on Saturday and two firms have been tasked with the work of mapping the properties. The civic body intends to complete the process by July end.
 
 The city has around 7.8 lakh properties, which include open plots, commercial as well as residential buildings, educational institutes and other government properties. The civic body has been demolishing buildings which were not constructed in accordance with the law.
