The thought of seeing actor Sreenivasan and   on-screen as a couple in the film Honey Bee 2 has already gotten the Malayali audience excited! 

 It looks like the combination is here to stay, as the duo will be seen essaying the role of a husband and wife in yet another film titled  , directed by debutant Sreekrishnan. Interestingly, the movie's script will be by Sreenivasan and it will be rich with all the aspects that a film from him will have. 
 
  Lena says that the movie is essentially a family drama, which will be close to the hearts of all. 'I play the role of Annie, a teacher, and my character is meticulously woven into the story. Sreenivasan and I belong to different religions and had a love marriage. However, they are childless and problems crop up,' she says.
  Having essayed a lot of character roles on-screen, it really seems like a breath of fresh air for Lena, who is cast in one of the lead roles. She adds, 'I would say it is a dream role for me. There certainly is a difference in this role, as the film revolves around me, and that changes everything. I have to consistently be performing.'
 
 About being cast opposite Sreenivasan, Lena says that she has been a fan since childhood. 'Sreenivasan is indeed the backbone of the film. He is very specific about what he wants from the character. But he is not that serious on the sets. He keeps cracking jokes often, and everyone has a lot of fun. There is this scene, in which both of us are riding a cycle, and it was hilarious. He used to say something in a rather serious tone, but the way he used to present it was such that we used to end up laughing to the core.'
