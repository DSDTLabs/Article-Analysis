AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday paved the way for a man in   to prove his   by abusing and humiliating him in public during his divorce proceedings before  .

 This 43-year-old government employee has been seeking a divorce from her wife since 2013. While hearing the case, the family has granted the man permission to visit his minor daughter every alternate Sunday in a public park, which is situated between their houses in Sector 7 of the capital.
 
 During one such visit, there was a quarrel between the man and his wife, who allegedly abused and threatened him. The man recorded the audio of the agitated woman in his mobile phone, and made an   out of it.
 
 The man, then, requested the family court to allow him to play the CD in court to establish how cruelly his wife behaved with him. The court did not grant him permission to place the CD on record without appropriate certificate for considering the CD as an electronic evidence.
 
 This brought the man before the high court, which has asked him to request the family court to send the CD before the   for verification of the audio clip by following the procedure of collecting voice samples of the woman for authentication of the CD, said advocate Jeet Bhatt who represented the man before the HC.
