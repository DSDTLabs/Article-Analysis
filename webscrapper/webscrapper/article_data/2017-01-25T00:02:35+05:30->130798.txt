Chennai: Only 35 pro-jallikattu protesters were found campaigning at   till Tuesday evening even as some parents rushed to the venue to persuade their wards to withdraw. Some volunteers who have been part of the week-long protest tried to negotiate with students to quit.

 “We spoke to the students and clarified that there would be no hurdles to conduct Jallikattu in the future. Several were convinced and returned home,” Mary, a homemaker, from Perungalathur said. Police were seen talking to protesters saying no action would be initiated against them and necessary arrangements would be made to ferry them home.
 
 However, not convinced with the assurance, a section of protesters continued demanding release all arrested protesters.
