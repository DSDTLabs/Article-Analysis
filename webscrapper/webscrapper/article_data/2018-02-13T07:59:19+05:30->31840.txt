NEW DELHI: Home minister Rajnath  , who reviewed the security situation on Monday in the light of Saturday’s fidayeen attack at Army’s Sunjwan camp and a bid by terrorists to storm a   camp in Srinagar on Monday, emphasised the need for security forces to ensure foolproof perimeter security and round-the-clock surveillance at their facilities across J&K. 

 Sources said Singh also instructed security forces and J&K police to step up joint counter-terrorist operations in the state as well as keep a check on infiltration. 
 
 “Terror outfits have taken a major hit in view of the successful counter-operations. It appears ISI-backed Jaish and LeT, to revive the morale of their cadres, have decided to unleash spectacular attacks... the key therefore is ensuring that the camps are fortified and personnel guarding the perimeter vigilant enough to spot and challenge any approaching terrorists,” said a senior home ministry officer.
 
 Government sources pointed out that ISI is primarily using Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in carrying out attacks at the camps of  , BSF and CRPF while Let and HM are rearranging their strength in the valley, which is a cause of worry. 
 
 About 60 highly trained Pakistani terrorists, mostly fidayeens, belonging to JeM are presently based in Jammu and Kashmir while more are likely to infiltrate as soon as the passes start opening in South Kashmir, said sources. Sources in security forces claimed that frequency of fidayeen attacks is being regularly monitored at the highest level. 
 
 Rajnath Singh held two separate security reviews through the day, one a larger meeting attended by representatives of army, central forces and intelligence agencies and a second one exclusively with home Secretary and Director, Intelligence Bureau. 
 
 While the morning meeting saw him take stock of the situation in J&K in wake of the latest terrorist attacks, the second meeting in the afternoon is believed to have focused on the way forward.
