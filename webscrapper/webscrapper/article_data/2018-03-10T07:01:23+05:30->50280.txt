Lucknow: Commuters can hope for less snarls in the city and a faster commute sometime soon. Planning better traffic management,   has divided the city into five traffic zones, each headed by an inspector. 

 The five zones will be Airport, Hazratganj, Charbagh, Chowk and trans-Gomti. SSP Lucknow Deepak   said, "The inspectors will ensure regularisation of traffic, pay attention to accidents and management of VVIPs and rallies."
 
 Each inspector will report his position to the control room from 8am till 9pm. During peak hours, from 9am to 11am, and 5pm to 8pm, they will have to inspect important crossings.
 
 SSP Kumar said that each inspector will ensure that stoppage of autos and buses is 50 metres away from roundabouts and crossings, remove all illegal autos and bus stops, and keep a watch on over-loading.
 
 CO, Traffic, Rajesh   said that it is for the first time that uniformity in movement of traffic has been planned in city. The plan is being implemented in the city after a trial during Investor' Summit.
