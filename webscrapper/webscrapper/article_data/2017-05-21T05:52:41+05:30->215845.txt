PANAJI: Almost a year after accessibility audits of 31 buildings and public spaces were complete, the government is yet to prepare the estimate of funds required to make them  . Its lax approach to the matter recently prompted the social welfare department to request that the task of estimation be handed over to a non-governmental agency.

 Only three of the 31 public buildings and spaces surveyed under the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities’ Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) had received ‘satisfactory’ ratings. 
 
 The offices of the director of tourism and the   (GTDC), both housed at Paryatan Bhavan, and the directorate of art and culture had fared better than the rest in terms of accessibility. 
 
 The  , the general post office, the Panaji police station, the   bus terminus in the capital city, the CCP, the urban health centre and the social welfare department had received ‘poor’ ratings where their accessibility to persons with disabilities, including senior citizens, was concerned. 
 
 The popular Miramar, Calangute, Baga, Candolim and Colva beaches also received a similar rating. 
 
 A majority of the buildings didn’t make the mark for lack of kerb ramps in footpaths, beepers or audio signals, and tactile guidance in footpaths at their entrances.
 
 Accessibility auditors from the Universal Design Centre, BNCA, Pune, had provided detailed recommendations for each of these buildings and public spaces to ensure that they are made fully accessible. These, however, are yet to see the light of day. 
 
 For Panaji’s KTC bus terminus, for instance, the auditors had recommended accessible toilets, a new accessible cafeteria, handrails for ramps and steps, relocation of the information counter, accessible ticket counters, an accessible drinking water fountain, audio signages, and emergency evacuation provisions.
