CHANDIGARH: Raising question over   and political-appointee officers on special duty (OSDs) in Haryana chief minister’s office (CMO) issuing orders to  ,   officer   has said that this was against the state’s own rules of business.

 When one such order by an OSD of CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s reached Khemka, who is posted as principal secretary for science and technology, mentioning “chief minister has desired…”, he raised a red flag. The whistleblower officer has said that since such orders were not signed by the chief minister, they did not have any legal sanctity.
 
 Khemka has now brought the issue to the knowledge of chief secretary   and cabinet minister Anil Vij. The file noting, accessed by the TOI, reads, “The administrative secretary is responsible for the correct observance of the Rules of Business. Orders and directions are received directly from persons appointed in the Chief Minister’s office. Sometimes, such persons are outsiders not appointed through a fair selection procedure mandated under Articles 14 & 16.”
 
 Khemka has mentioned that OSDs appointed in the CMO were supposed to aid and advise the chief minister in the discharge of his functions. He has now sought clarification from the state government as to whether an order or direction issued from the CMO is binding on government departments without approval of the concerned minister in charge.
 
 The senior IAS officer has also sought a list of the names and designations of persons authorized to communicate approvals or orders of the chief minister. He has also sought clarification whether such approval or order of the chief minister conveyed by a signatory other than the chief minister requires to be confirmed in writing by the chief minister.
 
 Khattar has five OSDs: Neeraj Daftaur, Amarjit Singh, Bhupeshwar Dayal, Amarender Singh and Capt Bhupinder. They are either from RSS or have central leadership’s backing. Also, Deepak Mangla is political secretary to CM.
