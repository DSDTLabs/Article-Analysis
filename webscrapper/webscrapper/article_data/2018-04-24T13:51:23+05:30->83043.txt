PANAJI: The Goa State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has upheld an order of the North Goa Consumer Forum directing Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) to return a repaired modem or replace it with a new one within 30 days. It also ordered   to pay Rs 10,000 to an aggrieved customer.

 The commission, in an order by Justice U V Bakre and Justice Jagdish Prabhudessai, stated that the affidavit and documents BSNL produced in the appeal couldn’t be considered as they were “totally new and contrary to the facts as stated in the written version before the forum”. 
 
 The commission held that BSNL didn’t explain why the facts sought to be disclosed by way of affidavit/documents weren’t disclosed earlier in the written version. It added that the consumer didn’t get an opportunity to explain his stand on the new facts. 
 
 In August 2016, when the instrument supplied by BSNL stopped functioning, the consumer, a doctor from St Cruz, took it to the Merces telephone exchange, where the technical staff promised to repair it within 48 hours, but failed to do so. Stating that he lost contact with his patients due to the malfunctioning instrument, the doctor submitted a complaint at BSNL Bhavan,  . He stated that he incurred loss in his practice and had been paying bills to BSNL without telephone service.
 
 BSNL, in its defence, stated that the WLL instrument was thoroughly checked and could not be reset due to change in frequency which was beyond the hands of the company. It advised the complainant to close the connection and instead take a landline connection, which he refused. BSNL also stated that some WLL connections had been disconnected due to technical and administrative reasons.
 
 In his complaint before the forum, the doctor asked for reimbursement of the money paid to BSNL from the month of August 2016 with interest of 12%, as well as reimbursement of taxi fare to the tune of Rs 6,000.
