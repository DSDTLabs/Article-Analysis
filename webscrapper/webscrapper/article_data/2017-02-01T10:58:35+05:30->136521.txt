MADURAI: A petition before the   has said that a former judge of the Supreme Court,   who had given a judgment in favour of the   (AWBI) and  , and was bestowed with `Man of the Year' award in 2015 by the latter (PeTA) for the same, has clearly violated and abused Article 124 (7) of the Indian Constitution.

 The Article 124 (7) says a retired judge of the Supreme Court shall not plead or act in any court or before any authority in the country , which by that very fact means that the retired judge is not at all supposed to receive any favour or award or written gift for rendering favourable judgment to a party . Thus, it is necessary to restrain the secretariat of the President of India from considering the afore-said judge Radhakrishnan in giving an opportunity to him in the sittings of the Supreme Court in future under Article 128, the petitioner said. He further sought direction to the former judge to re turn the award he received from PeTA, by declaring it as unconstitutional.
 
 Salai Chakrapani, a 62year-old agriculturist from Pudukottai district has filed the public interest litigation.The petitioner said the former judge Radhakrishnan gave a judgment on May 7, 2014 in the case of AWBI vs A Nagaraj and others, quashing the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009 as unconstitutional. In that case, PeTA was one of the representing parties.
