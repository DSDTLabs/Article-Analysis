BHOPAL: A 20-year-old girl   in a car after attending a party at a mall had a harrowing experience on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday when a few men not only pulled her out of the vehicle but even tried to drag her to a remote location before relatives came to her rescue.

 According to the complaint filed by the girl, the incident occurred at around 2 am after around four men overtook her car when she was returning home.
 
 She was alone in the car and the men pulled her out before they tried to take her to an isolated place located near the incident spot. The accused stopped only after the girl’s brother and   who were following in another car rushed to her aid. When the brother confronted them, they manhandled him and even broke the glasses of his car.
 
 One of the accused was identified as one   who along with three others was involved in the shameful act. The girl registered a complaint at police station immediately after the incident. No one has been arrested yet. It is also significant to note that police have not even appointed an investigating officer in the case.
 
 Sub-inspector   said, “Nobody has been arrested. We still have to appoint an investigating officer in the case as incident occurred late at night.”
