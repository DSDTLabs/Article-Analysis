Ghaziabad: A 26-year-old MNC employee on Tuesday lodged a complaint with the SSP’s office against her husband, a UK national, for blackmailing her after making an obscene video of her.

 The woman stated that she got married to him in November 2015 and got their marriage registered in 2016. However, after their wedding, her husband did not take her to the UK over one pretext or another. Instead, he kept visiting her at her home in Indirapuram periodically.
 
 The MNC employee, met her husband, who works for a London-based firm, through a common friend and began a relationship. The man had promised to take her to London after their wedding, but never showed any interest in getting her visa ready.
 
 A few months ago when she insisted on going with him, her husband made an obscene video of her after lacing her drink with sedatives. He then threatened to upload the video on the internet and took lakhs of rupees from her. The woman has also accused him of trying to force her to sleep with other men.
 
 She further alleged that she recently came to know through another common friend that the man never intended to take her with him, and only wanted to extract money from her.
 
 The SSP office has forwarded the complaint to its women’s cell for further investigation. Additional SP (police control room), Manish Kumar Mishra said, “As the case pertains to a married couple, the women cell will conduct an inquiry and submit a report. An FIR will be lodged on the basis of the investigation report.”
