KORAPUT: Defying Maoist threat, villagers of Marigeta and Bodigeta panchayats in Kalimela block of   district voted on Sunday for the rural polls after a gap of 15 years. Last time the villagers of the twin panchayats had voted in 2002 in rural polls. 

 Sources said with police throwing a security blanket in the region, the villagers could muster courage to vote on Sunday amid ultras' call for poll boycott. 
 
 Owing to extremist threat, the villagers had not participated in the previous two rural polls. The dwindling Maoist organisation in the area could be a reason for people going against the Red diktat, said a source at Kalimela. 
 
 Police said keeping in mind the rebels' dominance in the area, security was beefed up for the rural polls and drone cameras were used to keep an eye on the movement of guerillas and anti-socials. 
 
 "The drone cameras were of high quality and captured pictures within their 10-km radius," said SP (Malkangiri) Mitrabhanu Mohapatra. 
 
 Apart from the drone cameras, over 500 security personnel from SOG, DVF and   were pressed into service for counter-insurgency operations in the area on Sunday. 
 
 "As all the three zilla parishad seats for which elections were held on Sunday come under Kalimela block, we had intensified our combing operations and the forces were kept on high alert," the SP said. 
 
 The Maoists had given poll boycott in the district and threatened to chop off fingers of those who dared to cast votes. Officials said the over 65% polling was recorded on Sunday. 
 
 Earlier, during the second phase of the polls on February 15, not a single voter turned out in at least 10 polling booths in Nakamamudi panchayat under Korkunda blocks in the district owing to Maoist fear.
