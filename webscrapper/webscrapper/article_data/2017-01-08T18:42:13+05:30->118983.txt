LUCKNOW: Despite talks of alliance with SP in Uttar Pradesh, Congress today said it was going ahead with preparations for fielding   in all 403 Assembly seats in the state.

 "We are in the process of selecting candidates for all the seats," UP PCC chief   said here.
 
 He said all the names will be recommended to the Central Election Committee of Congress by tomorrow.
 
 So far candidates have been selected for the first three phases of the UP polls.
 
 Babbar has not been in favour of any alliance with SP, though senior Congress leader and incharge of UP Ghulam Nabi Azad is not averse to such a tie-up.
 
 Meanwhile, senior SP leader Ramgopal Yadav refused to reveal his cards, saying he had not spoken to Akhilesh Yadav and was not in a position to make any comment.
 
 Akhilesh has been saying that the SP will get majority on its own and in case of an alliance, they will get over 300 seats.
 
 Talks of a possible alliance with Congress had hit the roadblock when Mulayam Singh Yadav ruled out a tie-up with any party and favoured only merger of parties with SP.
 
 But, with Akhilesh gaining the upper hand in the power game in Samajwadi Party, Congress seems to be moving closer to an alliance with the ruling party in Uttar Pradesh to keep Muslim-Yadav equation intact.
