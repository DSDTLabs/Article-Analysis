NOIDA: Residents of Express View Apartments in Sector 93 complained of   supply on Wednesday. The apartment complex has 1,008 flats, of which 850 are occupied. The residents also claimed there is no regular supply of Ganga water, which is often diverted to more affluent neighbouring societies.

 “We got dirty, muddy water supply early on Wednesday morning with very low pressure. The water was so muddy that it could not be used for anything — washing, cleaning or bathing,” said Sujit Pandey RWA president of Express View Apartments.
 
 However, according to Pandey, this is not the first time that the society had got   water. 
 
 Another resident, Deepak Kumar, said that “the poor quality of water supplied to the residents has become a norm with no action by the   despite repeated complaints. On top of that, the pipes are rusting, old and in need of change”.
 
 When contacted, MD Pandey, senior project engineer (Jal 3), denied dirty water supply to the society. But junior engineer in-charge of sectors 92, 93 and 93A, Vinod Sharma, said the water was dirty as the department had done flushing of pipes (to clean it off deposits) during supply time.
 
 On rusting pipes and low pressure of water supply, Sharma said, “The residents need to change their old, galvanised iron pipes to CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) pipes, which are thermoplastic ones.”
