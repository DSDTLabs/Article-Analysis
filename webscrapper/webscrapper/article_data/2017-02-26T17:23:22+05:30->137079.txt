Actress-producer   has been controversy's favourite child for a while now, as she has been entangled in issues someway or the other. The latest one to have made headlines is the news about a scam that was allegedly done by a woman called Sandra Thomas in the garb of an artificial flower business. 

 While the news was being reported, the picture that was used was that of the producer's. According to reports, Sandra raised strong remarks against the fabrication of news, and also asserted that it is actually very baseless. 
 Sandra also highlighted that while it would give mileage to yellow journalism, the people concerned, who are essentially celebrities have to bear the brunt of things.
