MARGAO: Expressing solidarity with one of their fraternity members, Dr  , who was allegedly assaulted by two persons at his Carmona clinic on Monday, practitioners associated with the   marched to the   district police headquarters at Margao on Tuesday, demanding justice. 

 A delegation of doctors met South Goa SP Chandan Chowdhary and demanded stern action against both the accused. Speaking to reporters, Chowdhary said while one of the accused,  , has been arrested, the police are on the lookout for his daughter, Genevieve. 
 
 While the accused’s contention was that Redkar didn’t intervene to save the life of the patient who was brought to his clinic three weeks ago, Chowdhary said, “That doesn’t give anyone the right to barge into a doctor’s clinic and resort to violence.”
 
 Redkar narrated his version of the episode. “An elderly woman, was brought to my clinic three weeks ago. When they asked me to see the patient in the car outside, I asked them to get her inside, to which they said that she couldn’t be moved. When questioned why, they said she couldn’t breathe. At this point, I suggested that they rush her to the hospital nearby where better facilities would be available to revive her. They insisted that I see her. By the time I went out, the woman was gone,” Redkar said. 
 
 On Monday, the husband and daughter of the deceased woman confronted Redkar holding him responsible for her death. While Genevieve allegedly hit Redkar on his face, George allegedly abused him. Colva police booked an offence against the accused and arrested George. 
 
 IMA office-bearers demanded that the police book the accused under the Medicare Act where there are stringent provisions for such offences to be booked as non-bailable ones.
