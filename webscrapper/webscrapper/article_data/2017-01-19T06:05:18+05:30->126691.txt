 (ALLAHABAD): The   (VHP) will give the   government three months’ time after the assembly elections to construct the Ram temple at  . The decision was taken in a ‘Chintan Shivir’ organised during the   on Wednesday. The VHP will postpone the campaigning for construction of the Ram temple till the polls are over in the five states.

 The VHP also warned the central government that it would organise a march to the Parliament with about 80 lakh members if the latter failed to speed up the process for building the Ram temple. VHP’s international general secretary, Champat Rai presided over the meeting.
 
 “We have suspended all the agitation for building the Ram temple with immediate effect as the   is engaged in assembly polls. The campaigning will intensify after the polls,” Rai said in the meet, which was attended by VHP leaders from Awadh, Kashi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur prants (regions).
 
 He added, “VHP will be giving only 90 days’ time after the elections. We want the government to expedite the process for creating a special bench for day-to-day hearing of the temple case or pass a bill in the Lok Sabha for building the temple. If either of the two demands are not met, then Modi government should be ready to face the VHP.” 
 
 He said the central government is dilly dallying over the Ram temple issue due to which resentment is brewing among the saint community. 
 
 “Saints are not ready to hear any excuse whatsoever from the Modi government. I urged VHP office bearers and saints to prepare themselves for an agitation if the government again fails to fulfil our demands,” he added. VHP claimed that people have given a mandate to Narendra Modi led government to build the temple.
