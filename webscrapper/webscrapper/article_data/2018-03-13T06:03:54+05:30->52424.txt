 Islamic State terror group emir in Jammu & Kashmir Abu Yahya was among three terrorists killed in an encounter with security forces in south Kashmir’s Anantnag early on Monday.

 The trio was earlier affiliated to groups like the Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen but had pledged allegiance to Islamic State (ISJK) last year. They are part of a small but significant number of terrorists who have left groups like HM, Lashkar or Jaish to declare their allegiance to IS. The group sees Hurriyat as “compromised” politicians and its online propagation is resulting in a steady stream of recruits.
