NEW DELHI: As the   increases, Northern railways has deployed civil defence   and Bharat scouts across three major stations in the city to help ease the congestion and assist passengers, especially the elderly and the disabled, in accessing their trains. The stations will include Old Delhi, New Delhi and Anand Vihar with plans to add more such personnel to other stations as well.

 Close to 45 civil defence volunteers have already been deployed starting last week, railway officials said and more are likely to be added based on the summer rush and congestion. In addition, 25 Bharat scout volunteers have also been deployed at New Delhi   with two help booths setup at Platform 1 and 16 for passengers.
 
 R N Singh, divisional railway manager of the Delhi division says the main objective of their deployment was to help out senior citizens, women, children and the disabled. “They have been asked to assist everyone in a caring manner with the motto of Athithi Devo Bhava. Wheelchairs and Golf carts have been kept handy for the elderly and the disabled. Both civil defence volunteers as well as Bharat scouts can take them to the desired platform or train but also help with general queries,” said Singh.
 
 Officials say access to wheelchairs has been made easier with their presence as one just needs to approach a volunteer directly on the platform. Provisions for golf carts have also been made. In addition, the volunteers will be keep a tab on the cleanliness, functioning of lights and fans as well as the availability of drinking water, reporting any deficiencies to the authorities. They will also report overcrowded platforms and long queues to the authorities to ensure timely management.
