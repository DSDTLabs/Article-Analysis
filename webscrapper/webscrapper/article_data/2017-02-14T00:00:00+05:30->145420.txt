Little did Adarsh Vyshak, a Class five student know that when he accompanied his grandfather to an adoption drive for street dogs, he would return home with double the joy and a four-legged friend. “Once she spotted me, she started to wag her tails and I could not ignore the shine in her eyes. I think she likes me and I wanted to take her home. She is white in colour and I have named her Whitey,” says Adarsh, adding, “Now I will have company at home when I return from school.”

 Like Adarsh and his grandfather, several denizens from Trivandrum flocked to the My Desi Valentine event, an adoption drive for street dogs held at Manaveeyam Veedhi on Saturday. Puppies aged between 30 days and two months were up for adoption. While 12 pooches found homes, many people who came for the event expressed their interest to adopt rescued local breeds.
  One of the adopters, Merin Samuel, an undergraduate from Mar Ivanious College points out that the drive is a step in the right direction to curb the street dog menace. “Giving home to strays will help reduce the incidents of attacks by dogs. Proper sterilisation and vaccination will make strays healthy and lessen the aggressive instinct.”
 
  Sunitha Susheelan, one of the organisers, says that the rescued canines and puppies undergo a detailed examination by vets before being handed over to people for adoption. We also provide anti-rabies vaccination for the pups once they are adopted. An adoption certificate is also provided to the owners that include all the details of the vaccinations,” she says.
 
  The organisers have been conducting similar drives over the past 18 years at Kovalam and Shangumugham beaches. “Through this we also want to spread awareness that local breeds are most suited for the climate in Kerala than the foreign breeds,” says Sunitha.
