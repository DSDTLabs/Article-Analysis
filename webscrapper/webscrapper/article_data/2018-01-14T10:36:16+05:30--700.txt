BHUBANESWAR: The Nandankanan zoo had cause for celebration on Saturday as   successfully delivered two cubs. The two were fathered by the zoo-born Saif. 

 With the birth of the cubs, the tiger population in the zoo has gone up to 26. Of them, eight are white tigers, 16 are normal and two melanistic. "The health of the cubs is being monitored on CCTV cameras as no one can enter the enclosure now. Ankita is healthy and taking care of her babies," said zoo deputy director Jayant Das.
 
 Zoo officials said the sex of the cubs are yet to be known. Incidentally, Ankita was born on this day in 2012 to tigress Sara. She and Saif were allowed to mate in October 2017, zoo officials said. Saif came to Nandankanan from a zoo in Hyderabad.
 
 Meanwhile, the zoo authorities on Saturday completed reinforcing the tiger enclosure by putting up an additional iron mesh. In October last year, tigress Megha had tried to climb up the iron mesh to access her partner, Nandan. Following the incident, she was kept in a separate enclosure. 
 
 "Megha was Nandan's mate and she gave birth to two cubs. They are more than a year old and have been put on display in an enclosure with their father. However, the enclosures of Megha and Nandan are separated by that of tigress Bijaya. So, Megha and Bijaya have frequent fights," zoo officials said.
