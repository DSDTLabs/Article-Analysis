CHANDIGARH: Residents of   and the everyday commuters travelling through the village are by now used to a bumpy ride, with their village roads in a miserable condition. 

 With two  , acting as the prime outlets and inlets to the village, tapering to intersect, the poor condition of the route has made it difficult for people to ply on the same, without a rickety ride. 
 
 “The road is broken from various points and at some places, the potholes are huge. Sometimes , two-wheelers skid here and fall down while trying to cross from this spot,” said Asha, a resident of the village. 
 
 The roads, at various ends has also sunk in, exposing the bottom layer of the road, revealing the mud bed beneath, thus leading to added pressure on the car wheels. “I have been living over here for the past five years, and I haven’t seen the road being carpeted ever. Hence, the problem of bad roads has only grown from bad to worse with time,” said  , a nearby resident. 
 
 At many places, the road is seen to be covered in gravel along the sides of the road. Larger stones covering the potholes and other type of bumps on the road which has created a slippery situation at these points can also be spotted, thus increasing the risk of vehicular accidents over here. “The road, which is broken and has potholes, has also torn off with time, and water during the monsoon season also gets collected in the puddles,” said a shopkeeper. 
 
 However, when asked about raising a complaint with the municipal corporation, Chandigarh, many residents blamed the corporation with neglect and apathy. “We have sent them written letters but they don't respond and nothing happens. Once in two years, they just sometimes come and pick up the gravel,” added Raman.
