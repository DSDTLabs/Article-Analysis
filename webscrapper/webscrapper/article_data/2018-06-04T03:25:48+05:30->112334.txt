NEW DELHI: Lok Janshakti party chief   met BJP president   on Sunday, seeking an ordinance to restore the original provisions of a law on atrocities against Dalits and for reservation in promotion in government jobs for the scheduled castes.

 
 “Amit Shah assured us of action soon in both these cases. Wherever I am going as a part of the reach out programme to highlight four years’ achievements of government, people are asking me these questions,” Paswan told TOI. He added that the government is keen to take more steps for the welfare of Dalits and minorities. Paswan was accompanied by his son Chirag who is also a Lok Sabha MP.
 
 The Union minister said they also raised the special category status for Bihar, a long-standing demand made by chief minister   as well. “Bihar is one of the poorest states. So many states are demanding it. Bihar deserves it. We have been demanding the special status since we came to power at centre in the NDA,” Paswan said.
 
 The  , in a recent order, introduced new guidelines which, almost every political party has claimed, dilutes the law and will lead to a rise in crimes against Dalits. The government has moved the apex court for a review.
