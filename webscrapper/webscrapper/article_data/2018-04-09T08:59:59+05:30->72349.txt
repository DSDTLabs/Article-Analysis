BHOPAL:   has put his own party’s government to embarrassment by blaming the district administration for violence during the Dalit-called   on April 2 .

 On Sunday, he alleged that the district collector and superintendent of police did not take preventive action despite getting intelligence inputs on March 29.
 
 Talking to media in Morena, Mishra said he was prepared to hold an agitation against the two if the people of Morena were willing to join him. Later, talking to TOI, Mishra claimed that three days before the violent agitation, people took out large bike rallies, carrying mashals and shouting slogans. The administration did not respond even after the bike rallies, he said.
 
 Mishra, a four-time MLA and former minister, said that after an agitation of farmers about four months ago, he had pointed out the “indifference” of the bureaucrats, but to no avail.
 
 One person died and dozens injured in violence that day. Public property worth crores, including that of railways, was damaged in the agitation. Several trains were delayed as protesters blocked tracks.
 
 Curfew is still in force from 9pm to 7am in Morena district. During the day time, Section 144 is in force. The administration has suspended arms licenses in three riot-hit districts and thousands have surrendered their arms.
 
 Faced with a barrage of criticism for failing to pre-empt the April 2 violence, the state government had said that intelligence warnings were passed on to the three district administrations but local officials couldn’t take effective counter measures.
