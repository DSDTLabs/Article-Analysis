UJJAIN: With the appeal by the state government seeking possession of Vinod Mill land in Ujjain being quashed by the Indore bench of high court on Wednesday, the municipal corporation’s smart city proposal will now see some major changes. 

 The total area of the mill land is around 45 acre, which the corporation has proposed in the smart city proposal sent to the state. 
 
 However, the high court in 2004 had held that Vinod Mills land was the property of the official liquidator who had the right to sale the land and settle the dues of the workmen.
 
 A division bench of   RK Dubey heard the appeal filed against this order by the state on Wednesday and upheld the previous order. 
 
 “Vinod Mills land was proposed to be developed on the public-private partnership model and Indore’s Mehta and Mehta consultants had been roped in to prepare the plan for the development of the land. However, if the land is sold to any private group, he might build his own project on this piece of land, which will be against the smart city plans decided by the corporation for the area,” said Ujjain smart city project CEO Awadhesh Sharma. 
 
 Along with the Vinod Mills, the corporation had also included the vacant land of   in its smart city project. This mill, which also became defunct in 2002 is spread over a total area of 18 hectare. However, the possession of this land is with the   (NTC) and the government has proposed that if the land is made available to them for the smart city plan, they will develop it also using the PP model.
