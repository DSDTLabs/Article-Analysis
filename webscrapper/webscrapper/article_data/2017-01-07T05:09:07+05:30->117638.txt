NAVI MUMBAI: Cracking down on  , the Konkan Railway’s   (RPF) seized 6,830   (IMFL) bottles, totally worth Rs 5.26 lakh, in 2016 and arrested 32   for illegally transporting them on trains.

 Sreekumar Kurup, assistant security commissioner of   RPF, said, “The bootlegging nuisance was an important aspect concerning passengers travelling on Konkan railway (KR) trains. It was mostly due to the proximity of Goa, where IMFL is available at low price. The RPF carried out regular and consistent drives and nabbed bootleggers. The drives were successful due to the effective use of CCTV camera surveillance and staff’s vigilance at railway stations.”
 
 He added, “Last year, as many as 45 missing children, either runways or wandered, were rescued and handed over to the Childline NGO which, in turn, handed over them to their parents. The RPF was instrumental in detention of 10 criminals involved in theft of belongings of passengers.”
