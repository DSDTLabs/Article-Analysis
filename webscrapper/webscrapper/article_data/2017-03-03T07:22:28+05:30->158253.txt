JAIPUR: Leader of opposition   on Thursday attacked the   saying it stood for “Four Cs”—crime, corruption, confusion and controversy. Dudi said the only   her government knew was ‘privatisation’.

 The Congress leader, while participating in the debate on the Governor’s address, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‘introduced’ corruption in banks through his decision on ‘note-ban’. “Earlier, banks had just one door. After note-ban, banks got a backdoor too,” Dudi said, suggesting about corruption in banks due to demonetisation.
 
 Claiming that relations between Raje and Modi were strained, Dudi had the house in splits with his demand for a probe into why the PM cancelled his plan to attend the “Resurgent Rajasthan” conclave of investors held here in 2015. “It is good that you are now working on improving relations with the PM. The state should not suffer because of strained relations,” Dudi told the CM.
 
 In his hour-long address, the   highlighted issues of 4500 SBC candidates, 26000 Vidhyarthi Mitra, thousands of Home Guards, farmers and state government employees. “Your Sankalp Patra made 611 promises to the people before the assembly election. Of these, just 25% have been fulfilled so far,” he said.
 
 As the leader of opposition hit out against government departments one by one, the ministers concerned interrupted his speech to counter the charges. Congress whip Govind Singh Dotasra objected to the interruptions and said the opposition too would not allow the CM to address the house if the ministers continued to disrupt Dudi. Power, PHED, PWD, forest, mines and panchayati raj departments were targeted by the leader of opposition, who stressed that state’s law and order deteriorated in past three years.
