BENGALURU: Citizens continued to encounter glitches while attempting to pay   on Friday too even as   (BBMP) officials consulted technical experts to resolve the issues. 

 Many taxpayers complained that the   (http://bbmptax.karnataka.gov.in/) was showing wrong tax estimates, not initiating the process and there were hiccups in online payment options and delays in processing.
 
 Citizens said the website hangs during the payment process. "When I paid my property tax on Thursday, the website began hanging after I initiated the process of paying by credit card. I got a text message that the money had been deducted but there was no sign of the receipt. Fortunately, I had saved the application and knew the number. I checked the status to find the payment had been made and then downloaded the receipt," a senior citizen pointed out.
 
  A senior official in the BBMP's   wing admitted there are some glitches but many problems are because people don't know the proper procedure. "We got a complaint from a Koramangala resident who said his tax amount is running into crores of rupees though he lives on a 1200 sqft plot. We found that he had entered the 10 digit application number in the site dimension block. We are creating more awareness about payments. People are requested to visit the closest office of the assistant revenue officer or ward officer to understand the process," he added.
