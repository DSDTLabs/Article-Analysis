SHIMLA: Reacting to charge-sheets filed against former Union finance minister P   and his family under the Black Money Act for possessing and operating several illegal assets and accounts in foreign countries, chief minister   said that this speaks of the level of corruption during the previous UPA government’s tenure.

 In a statement issued on Sunday, Thakur said that as per the estimates of the income tax department, the former finance minister held assets to the tune of $3 billion. “This explains why despite Supreme Court’s orders former   president Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Dr   and then finance minister P Chidambaram dragged their feet on the formation of SIT, one of the first decisions taken by the present NDA government headed by Prime Minister   to fight black money,” he added. Thakur asked why Congress president Rahul Gandhi had not taken action against Chidambaram in an alleged disproportionate assets case.
 
 The CM said that in its four years in power, the BJP has given an honest, scam-free government, a decisive leader and pro-poor thrust on governance. He said that for the first time ever, India had emerged as the fastest growing economy in the world.
