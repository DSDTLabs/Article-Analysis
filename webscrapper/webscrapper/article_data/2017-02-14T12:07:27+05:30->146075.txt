AGARTALA: Tripura chief minister   has asked   officers to work without fear and pressure for the sake of the state's development. 

 He said this while talking at the 24th biennial conference of Tripura Civil Service Officers' Association on Sunday evening. He added that for taking any decision, an officer should not be under fear or dilemma and should rather discharge his duties boldly in the larger interest of society. The bureaucrats are the key persons to run the government and help people, he said. 
 
 He added that besides routine work, the officers must meet people more frequently to resolve their problems. "If the chief minister can meet people thrice a week regularly, why can't the officials not meet them at least once a week ? asked Sarkar. He said, "Some officers just skip the issue instead of taking any decision, which is not expected of them." The chief minister added that time has come to change the style of functioning of civil service officers and society wants something innovative from them.
 
 He said while signing on files, the officers were expected to put comments also which helps the higher authorities to understand the problems better before taking a decision. The age-old tradition of file culture should be ended gradually, giving room to new ideas, he added.
