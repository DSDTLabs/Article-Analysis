Bhopal: Even as Rajasthan chief minister   has announced that Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period saga ‘Padmavat’ will not be released in the state respecting the sentiments of the people, MP government is yet to take a decision on the film release.

 Sources said that chief minister   will discuss the issue with members of the Rajput community before taking any decision as the film is slated to be released on January 25.
 
 Chouhan had on November 20 announced that ‘Padmavati’ could not be released in   till corrections are done as per the public demand. After meeting members of MP Rajput Samaj, who had been opposing the release of the film, Chouhan had also stated that the film included distorted facts and would not be allowed to be screened in the state till the controversial scenes were removed.
 
 Going a step ahead, the chief minister had also announced a bravery award in the name of ‘Rani Padmavati’.
 
 Sources said that after the nod by CBFC, Chouhan is likely to discuss the matter with Rajput Samaj which has been opposing the film. The Samaj will review changes made in the film and decide its future, sources added.
 
 However, members of Rajput Samaj are still firm on their stand to not allow the release of the movie before watching the amendments made by CBFC.
 
 Community members said that MP government had already banned the film and if it decides to lift the ban then Samaj would take its own decision. “As of now, the government has imposed ban on the movie. Chief minister had announced that distortion of historical facts would not be allowed. The Rajput Samaj would take decision if the government lifts ban on the movie. After the discussion we will decide our next course of action", said Samaj state general secretary Deepak Chauhan.
