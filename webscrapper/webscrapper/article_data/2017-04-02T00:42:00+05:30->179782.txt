Bhopal: In yet another shock for the power consumers of the state — Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) has increased power tariff by an average of 9.48%, on Saturday.

 Following the hike, the power bill of an average family that consumes around 200 units of power will now be Rs 1367 (approx.). It will thereby register an increase of Rs 137 per month from April onwards.
 
 Interestingly, power tariff is already highest in Madhya Pradesh compared to neighbouring Chhattisgarh and other states like Delhi. For the same consumption, one pays around Rs 775 in Chhattisgarh and around Rs 450 in Delhi. Power in Madhya Pradesh is 300% costlier than Delhi and 200% more when compared with Chhattisgarh.
 
 The worst hit because of the power tariff are agricultural consumers with a maximum hike of 13.18%. 
 
 Among others are public water works where it has gone up 13.18% while the raise is 7.83% for domestic consumers. The average power tariff hike is 9.48%. 
 
 The power distribution companies sought an hike of 10.62% against the revenue gap, i.e., the difference between the income and expenditure of the discoms of Rs 452 crores for financial year 2017-18. 
 
 MPERC after going through all the documents and objections raised by the consumers and consumer groups—allowed an average increase of 9.48%. 
 
 Interestingly, the MPERC had increased the tariff even above the proposed hike by discoms. In their tariff review petition for 2017-18, discoms had requested the MPERC to increase the power rates of consumers using less than 30 units of power from Rs 2.90 per unit to Rs 3.00 per unit but MPERC has increased it to Rs 3.10 per unit.
 
 Sources said that there is no embargo that MPERC will increase only that much power tariff as sought by discoms, but the decision to revise tariff is taken as per the regulations and the revenue requirements. For the consumers using less than 30 units, there is a regulation that the power tariff should not be less than half of the energy costs and at present the cost of per unit power comes to around Rs 6.28.
