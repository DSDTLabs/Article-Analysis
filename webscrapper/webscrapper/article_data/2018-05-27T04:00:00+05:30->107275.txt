Surat: Deputy commissioner of police (traffic), B R Pandor, suspended two traffic constables and terminated the services of three traffic brigade jawans here on Friday. 

 Umshankar Thakur, Jitendra Sangada and Shyam Karnkale, traffic brigade jawans, were caught on camera accepting cash from two-wheeler riders in the city. Their services were terminated by senior officers after a preliminary inquiry. Saitsh Ravidasbhai and Pramod Kadkiyabhai, police constables, were suspended because the traffic brigade jawans were collecting cash in their presence at Chowk crossroads.
 
 “The action was taken against the constables and traffic brigade jawans after we conducted a preliminary inquiry. A departmental inquiry will also be conducted against the constables,” Pandor said.
