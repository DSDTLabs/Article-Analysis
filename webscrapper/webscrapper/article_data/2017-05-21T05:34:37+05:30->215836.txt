PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday announced the government’s decision to start superspecialty courses in   (GMC) for which the process has been initiated.

 Addressing a press conference at his office on Saturday, Rane said his department has started the process of re-designation of consultants in existing superspecialty departments of the GMC, a first step to start superspeciality in the state’s premier hospital. GMC dean Dr   has been directed to write to   (MCI) about the proposal. “The whole idea behind this is to strengthen GMC and make it a premium teaching institute in the country,” Rane added.
 
 The GMC proposes to start superspeciality courses in department of urology with two master of surgery (MCh) seats, department of cardiology with two doctor of medicine (DM) seats, department of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (1 MCh seat), department of cardiac anesthesia (1 seat) and department of endocrinology (1 seat).
 
 At present, GMC has a Mch programme only in the neurosurgery department, and once MCh/DM or diplomate in national board (DNB) programmes are started in the proposed superspecialty departments, GMC will be recognized as a superspecialty teaching institute in the country, he said.
