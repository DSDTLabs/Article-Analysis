VADODARA: Students of final year masters of commerce (MCom) at M S University’s Faculty of Commerce have accused a teacher of the Department of Business Economics to harassment and intimidation. 

 Around 50 M Com final students had recently submitted a complaint against Dr K   alleging that he was threatening to seal their papers and will not allow them to take exams. The complaint submitted by the students to the head of department and dean of the faculty states that instead of teaching his subject properly, Shanmugan abuses other teachers of the departments and bad mouths their parents. 
 
 Sources said that when Shanmugan came to know about the complaint against him, he called few students, mostly girls and threatened them of dire consequences. Sources also said that when he summoned the students inside his cubicle, one of the girl students even collapsed while others left crying as the teacher threatened to reduce their marks if they continued submitting complaints against him.
 
 “He throws around his weight before students claiming to be some “government-nominated teacher” – whatever this means,” said a source privy to the developments. 
 
 Although Shanmugan could not be reached for his comments despite several attempts, faculty dean and   confirmed that he had received a complaint from students a couple of months back. 
 
 “I had ensured that grievances of students are resolved for which I had also taken the teacher with me and sorted out all issues. But I am not aware about the recent complaint,” said Nayak.
