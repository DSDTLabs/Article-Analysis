MUMBAI: Five days after lawyer   was arrested for allegedly procuring call detail records (CDR) of actor  's wife illegally, the   on Wednesday ordered his immediate release holding that his detention was “unlawful” and “high-handed”.

 The court directed the home department to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the police officers concerned, besides giving the go ahead for Siddiquee and his wife to initiate civil and criminal proceedings against the Thane police. 
 
  
 “The mandate of Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) is clearly flouted," said a bench of justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Prakash Naik while hearing a habeas corpus petition by Siddiquee's wife, Tasneem. Hours after the court's orders, police released Siddiquee.
 
 The Thane crime branch had issued a notice under Cr PC section 41 A to Siddiquee on March 16, directing him to be present for investigation on March 17 at 11 am. However, they arrested Siddiquee around 10 pm on March 16. “There was thus no justification provided as to how this police functionary proceeded and arrested Siddiquee,” said the judges. 
 
 A statement was made on behalf of DCP Abhishek Trimukhe that police had no objection if Siddiquee was released on the orders of the court. The bench said that the officer was not obliging it by making a statement and the least expected was for the officer to admit that he had taken the law in his hands and would voluntarily release Siddiquee. “This was the expectation from this police officer and if he had apologised genuinely and bonafide and sought time to release the petitioner's husband, we would not have directed any action to be taken against him. However, he remains adamant and persists that only if this court says, he would have no objection to such release,” observed the court. The court clarified that Siddiquee does not enjoy any immunity from prosecution and police could proceed against him but strictly in accordance with law.
