Mangaluru: To assess and measure the competency level of students at a young age and suggest changes in learning, the state government has introduced ‘Sadhana Examination’ for students of class 4 and 6 of government and aided schools in the state. 

 This is the first time that the Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) is introducing the Sadhana Examination pattern statewide. 
 
 “Earlier this exam was conducted in select taluks only. From this academic year, we have made it mandatory for all schools across the state,” Yashoda Bopanna, director, Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board, told TOI.
 
 Under this programme, KSQAAC will set the question papers for class 4 and class 6 and after the examinations, the answer papers will be evaluated by teachers from other schools. “This will help us know the strengths and weaknesses of the students. Based on these results, extra coaching will be provided for students in subjects they find difficult to grasp,” she added.
 
 The Sadhana Examination for class 4 and 6 began on Monday and will end on March 11. Each paper is of 50 marks. Once the evaluation is over, marks and other details of the students will be uploaded online. It is applicable for Kannada, English, Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Tamil and Telugu medium schools.
 
 A senior official in-charge of Sadhana Examination in Dakshina Kannada says this will help students understand their abilities before they enter higher primary and high school. “A student gets a year's time to upgrade his knowledge for higher primary and high-school,” he added.
 
 After the assessment, a student whose performance is poor is given extra coaching during summer holidays.
