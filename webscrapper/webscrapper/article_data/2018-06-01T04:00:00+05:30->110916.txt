Mumbai: Falling   prices and short-covering late in the   expiry session pushed the   up by 416 points and it closed at 35,322. Expectations of good   growth numbers (which was due after the markets closed and came in at 7.7% rate) and predictions of good monsoons helped the positive sentiment on Dalal Street. In the last couple of hours, short-covering by speculators — to cut their losses — also helped the rally, market players said.

 Banking and financial services firms led the rally with  , HDFC and   being the biggest contributors to the day’s gains, while Sun Pharma, Tata Motors and Hero MotoCorp being the laggards.

The day’s gains also added about Rs 1.6 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at almost Rs 149 lakh crore. Despite the rally in frontline stocks, mid and small cap stocks continued to witness selling pressure with BSE’s midcap index closing 0.2% lower while the smallcap index closing 0.6% down.
