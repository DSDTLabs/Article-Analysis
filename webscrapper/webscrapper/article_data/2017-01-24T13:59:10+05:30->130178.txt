PATNA: Attacking PM   for forcing common people to opt for cashless transactions,   general secretary and former Union minister   on Monday said such transactions would reveal the purchaser’s privacy and buying behaviour to the world.
 
  “The cashless transactions will keep a record of everything you purchase. It will have records of what and how much you purchased on which date and at which location,” Joshi said enumerating the drawbacks of cashless transaction at a state-level ‘Jan Vedna Sammelan’ at the state   HQ here.
  
  He said all the main servers of cashless transactions are located on foreign shores. “Your transactions and buying behaviour can be viewed by persons controlling these servers,” Joshi said.
  
  Maintaining that the idea of cashless economy is the product of a “fascist thinking”, Joshi said Modi was trying to benefit big corporate houses and the banks from where these big houses have taken giant loans. “The Congress workers will have to go to villages and educate people about Modi’s game-plan,” he said.
  
  Joshi appreciated state Congress chief Ashok Choudhary’s efforts to organise successful agitations in Bihar against notebandi.
  
  Party’s block and district-level functionaries MLAs and ex-MLAs attended the meet. Choudhary in his address thanked them for the success of party’s stirs against notebandi. He asked partymen to hold ‘Jan Sunwai’ (peoples’ hearing) against the PM in at least 182 blocks of the state before February 23, as per the AICC directive.
  
  Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh also addressed the meet.
