THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has decided to bring out an ordinance to regulate the price of bottled  . “We decided to bring bottled water under the Essential Commodities Act. Government will not allow anyone to charge Rs 20/litre and hence necessary legislation will be brought in to regulate the price,” said food and civil supplies minister P Thilothaman.

 
 Government has agreed to the demand of   to fix the price of one litre bottle at Rs
 
 13. Earlier, obeying the government directive, manufacturers had decided to bring down the price to Rs 12/litre from April 2 after GST was introduced in Kerala. However, retailers are still charging Rs 20/litre.
 
 Bottled water was initially sold for Rs 10/litre and manufacturers later increased the price to Rs 12, Rs 15, Rs 17 and Rs 20/bottle. In the backdrop of these events, government decided to bring an ordinance to regulate the price of bottled water.
 
 Thilothaman had convened a meeting of manufacturers and traders’ organizations to reach a consensus on reducing the price of bottled water.
 
 At the meeting, a section opposed the decision to bring down the price. Following this, the minister warned that bottled water will be brought under the Essential Commodities Act and then everyone will be forced to obey the government.
 
 The government was forced to bring in a legislation since a few companies were not ready to bring down the price. The government made it clear that there will be no compromise on quality since the price was reduced now. If any quality reduction is found, there will be strict action against the companies, said the minister.
