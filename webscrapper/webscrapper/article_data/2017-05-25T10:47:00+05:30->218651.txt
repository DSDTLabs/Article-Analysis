PATNA: The proposed nine regional centres of   ( ) at Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Chhapra, Munger and Saharsa will be functional from June 11, board chairman Anand Kishor said on Wednesday.

 Kishor said the regional centres will be directly linked with the main BSEB office in Patna. “The grievance cell at the main office will handle students’ issues like correction in documents, issuance of certificates, admit cards, marksheets, migration certificates and other stuff. Instead of making rounds of the main BSEB office, students can visit the regional centres for these issues from where their cases will be forwarded to the grievance cell for redressal,” Kishore said.
 
 He added, “From June 11, the regional centres will function from temporary buildings with two section officers, an assistant, an IT employee, a home guard, a caretaker, an account assistant and a sweeper. The Patna regional centre will be manned by more employees.”
 
 Kishor said the regional centres will shift to their permanent addresses by 2019. “The buildings are being constructed by the Bihar State Educational Infrastructure Development Corporation,” he added.
 
 The campuses of   (Patna), Haridas Seminary Uch Vidyalaya (Gaya), Jaglal Uch Vidyalaya (Bhagalpur), B K D   (Darbhanga), B B Collegiate School (Muzaffarpur), Zila School of Purnia and Saharsa, B Seminary School (Chhapra) and Uch Vidyalaya Vasudevpur (Munger) have been selected for construction of permanent buildings for BSEB regional centres. Each building will be built with an estimated expenditure of Rs 16.93 crore. Divisions like Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur will have five-storey building.
 
 “The upcoming regional centres will also be used as examination centres. More than 10,000 students can write papers at these centres in two sittings. These buildings will also be used as answer paper evaluation centres,” Kishore said.
