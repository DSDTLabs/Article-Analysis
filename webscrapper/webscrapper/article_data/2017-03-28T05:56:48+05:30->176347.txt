KOLHAPUR: After getting   in the first round of the   (RTE)  , the district primary   is planning to commence the second round of the admission later this week.

 Subhash Chougule, education officer (primary), told TOI that before continuing with the admission process, the pendency which the earlier round has produced needs to be cleared to zero.
 
 “In the first round, we got 525 confirmed admissions by the March 25 deadline. We have found that 580 parents have not approached for the admissions as of yet. Their pendency will be cleared through online mode and fresh second round of admissions will be called in later this week,” he said.
 
 According to Chougule, appropriate announcements will be made, once the dates for the second round admission process are finalised. “We will be taking in consideration the suggestions made by senior authorities and schools to ensure that we get desired response,” he said.
 
 “Since the department received less than 40% applications for the total number of seats in the city and district, there was no lottery drawn for many schools. This year, the department is trying hard to get a better response compared to last year, where the department failed to get less than 10% admissions,” Chougule added.
 
 Interestingly in the academic year 2015-16, the department had got over 60% response for the seats designated under the RTE Act.
 
 It should be noted that under the RTE Act, economically and socially disadvantaged children, as well as those with disabilities, can be admitted to Class I or at the pre-primary stage of private unaided schools. These children receive free education including textbooks, and other facilities.
