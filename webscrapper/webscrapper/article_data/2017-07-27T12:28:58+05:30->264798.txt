CHANDIGARH: The   and city schools are now embroiled in a debate over the   that are in force, whether the city follows the Right to Education Act or Punjab Education Code.

 The two have been at   over the department granting recognition to schools. While schools claimed that the issue of recognition was irrelevant as they were registered according to   Act, when it came into force in 2010, and there was no mention in the RTE Act that they had to apply for recognition after every few years, officials of the education department said extension of recognition was needed under the Punjab Education Code, which was followed by UT.
 
 To this, the schools said Punjab education Code held no meaning after RTE came into force. Independent Schools’ Association president H S Mamik said, “After the RTE Act, under which every school is registered, the issue of recognition is irrelevant. The (UT education) department needs to concentrate on its own schools, instead of trying to resurrect private schools. Are these 34 schools due for recognition not registered under the RTE Act? Registration under the law had its own form to be submitted to the department. All schools that are not registered should have closed by now.”
 
 UT director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said inspection committees had been formed and the work (of screening schools for further recognition) was in progress. “Once I get the progress report from them, we will update this information on our website,” he said.
 
 An official of the department who did not wish to be named said they had been following Punjab Education Code for years and the recognition of schools had to be renewed regularly under it. “As per RTE Act, it had to be done again for new and old schools. But since we had given initial recognition based on Punjab Education Code, we extended it for a few years. Schools often say that only RTE should be followed, but administration has not issued any clarification,” he said.
