 is back, pushing the boundaries to play the title role in '  Of Aarah'. The actress plays a singer, who hails from Aarah in Bihar, whose songs comprise lewd lyrics. She is a confident girl and the star performer of her troupe.

 Swara, who’s excited about this role, says, “Playing the titular role was not so much of a challenge as was conveying Anaarkali’s vulnerability and yet keeping the rugged and feisty aspects of her personality intact. It was interesting to portray a woman who sings songs with double meanings and wears her sexuality on her sleeves, but at the end of the day, she is also like any other woman with feelings. I made sure I didn’t cross the lines of vulgarity while playing Anaarkali. Yet, my performance had to be raw, original and hard-hitting. I am blessed to play some powerful roles at this point in my career.” Producer  , says, “I was aware of Swara’s capabilities as an actor, but the manner in which she got into this role surprised each one of us. We have fabulous performances from   and   too.” 
 
 'Anaarkali of Aarah', produced by Priya and Sandiip Kapur of Promodome Motion Pictures, releases on March 24.
