KOLKATA: Huge bales being loaded on buses parked on the road, honking vehicles trying to to get past the vans scattered on the thoroughfare and a helper on the bus yelling, “Can’t you see they are working? You have to wait” is a scene common for the locals on the stretch from   to   Road.

 
 They are now used to this chaotic environment that continues throughout the day. “We stopped using the road long ago. There is no point in arguing with the offenders. We use another lane that leads to the CIT Road,” a woman said.
 
 After the incident in which the car of a shoe manufacturer in   was allegedly set on fire for protesting on a similar issue on Wednesday, most locals kept mum.
 
 SK Sajid, a shopowner in the area, said, “Cars dropping passengers is another problem. Moreover, footpaths encroached by hawkers force pedestrians to take the road.” “The owner of a battery service centre here was complaining a few days ago that it has become difficult for him to dispatch goods due to the snarls,”   said.  , a resident of the area for five decades, said, “Often people relieve themselves in the open. There is a public bathroom, but nobody uses it.” “We do not object to the bus service. But it should be operated properly,” he added.
 
 In Golf Green, buses are parked along the road, making one-third of it inaccessible for other vehicles. Conductor of a route-223 bus, parked on   opposite an eye hospital,   said, “Our depot is at some distance from here. However, there is not enough space. So we park here for a while.”
 
 DC (traffic) Sumit Kumar said, “Removal of illegal parking is a priority for us. Kolkata has a limited road space and if there is any encroachment, the carriageway gets narrowed further.”
