NEW DELHI: A day after the CBI booked him for alleged corruption, former director of the agency   told TOI that his exchanges on Blackberry Messenger (BBM) with meat exporter Moin   were "mostly personal and innocuous in nature as between friends". 

 The retired IPS officer, who headed the CBI between November 2010 and November 2012, said none of his   with Qureshi pertained to the agency's investigations.
 
 Singh, who is credited with the 2G spectrum scam investigation, said he would offer detailed comments only after consulting his lawyer, but added that "suffice to say that these BBM messages have been in the public domain for over three years".
 
 "Income tax and Enforcement Director have not added anything further. None of the purported messages sent through Blackberry Messenger pertain to the CBI investigations. They are mostly personal and innocuous in nature as between friends," he said.
 
 Singh said a majority of the messages were exchanged with Qureshi after he had retired from the CBI on November 30, 2012.
 
 The agency has booked Singh under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act along with Qureshi, Hyderabad-based businessman Pradeep Koneru, Qureshi's employee Aditya and unknown public servants on a complaint by the ED.
 
 Meanwhile, CBI officials said they were examining documents shared by ED along with their complaint including Qureshi's BBM messages with several people.
 
 Sources said the agency may ask the income tax department and ED to give all the BBM messages Qureshi exchanged with Singh and others to know the context of their conversations. The ED has shared only 25 BBM messages of Singh and Qureshi, which took place in 2012 and 2013, along with its complaint.
