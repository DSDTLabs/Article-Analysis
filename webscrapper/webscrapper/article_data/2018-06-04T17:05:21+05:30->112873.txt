 Talking about the storyline of the film, Kareena said, "When we see four girls on screen, the audience thinks that it is a chick flick and it will be about their clothes, shoes and bags but this film is not like that. I think that's why the producers decided not to position this film as a chick flick because it's a story of four girls who are in different stages of marriage. We are showing certain issues in the film which we have not addressed earlier."
