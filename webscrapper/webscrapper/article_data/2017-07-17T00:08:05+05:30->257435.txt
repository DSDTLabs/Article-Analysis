It’s been two weeks since his celebrity chat show   wrapped up and host   is already experiencing withdrawal symptoms. “This season, the show gained epic proportions and I personally was witness to the kind of following it fetched because of social media. The previous two seasons, I wasn’t able to fathom the popularity because I wasn’t active on social media. This time around, I was extremely interactive, hence was able to see first-hand the kind of love and regard people have for the show. Also, the various personalities who graced the hot seat catapulted the show to another level,” he shares.
 Ramesh looks back on his   stint with much fondness and shares that it’s been five years since he first made a foray into this medium. “Preethi Inda Ramesh was what I debuted with and now, here I am at the end of five years with three seasons of WWR. TV has brought me closer to my well wishers and people have begun to think of me as their own. Another aspect is that with films, you work on them for a few months and you’re done. But in case of television, week after week, you are on your toes and beaming into the households of people... it is a whole different connect altogether. That is what you miss when it ends,” he states. 
  Ramesh adds how he is someone who likes to keep himself busy constantly. “If not films, then it’s television. Let’s see, I might take up another exciting and creatively challenging show on the small screen soon. TV has become both engaging and intriguing today,” he sums up.
