HYDERABAD: The 100th water ATM was inaugurated near the   on   on Monday. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) is planning to set up more such kiosks in its limits.

 “We want to set up 400 water ATMs in the city,” said mayor Bonthu Rammohan. These ATMs have been set up to provide clean drinking water to people at a low price. One glass of water costs Re 1 and it is Rs 2 per litre. But, one can buy 20 litres of water at just Rs 20.
 
 These water ATMs operate on Built Own and Operate (BOO) model. All you need to do is insert a coin and the machine dispenses water. People can get their own water bottles. However, a steel glass is attached to the machine with a chain.
 
 Water ATMs in the city are drawing a mixed response. While a lot of people were seen quenching their thirst at the machine at  , the footfall at the kiosk inside a residential area at   was less. “The treatment technology used in this system is internationally-patented based on a natural mineral which has unique properties,” said a top GHMC official.
 
 The area to set up these machines is being provided by GHMC. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has in principle given its consent to supply water to the ATMs free of cost. The water supplied by the board is collected on-site into a tank and then treated using the unit inside the kiosk.
