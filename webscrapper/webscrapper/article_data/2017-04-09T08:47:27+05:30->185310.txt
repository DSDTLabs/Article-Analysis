NEW DELHI: A 56-year-old man attacked his live-in partner with an axe till she stopped breathing at their house in southeast Delhi’s Okhla on Thursday night.

 The accused, identified as Chandrapal, told cops that the woman never gave him importance and always did what he opposed. According to the police, Chandrapal had an argument with the woman before he attacked her.
 
 After attacking her, Chandrapal fled towards the railway tracks near his locality, but was chased and caught by a police team. The woman,   (55), was a divorcee and had eight children, six of whom were married and two lived with her, said police.
 
 “The accused said that he often tried to make Devi understand things but she refused to listen to him. He was left with no option but to kill her,” said  , DCP (southeast).
 
 Devi, a sanitation worker, was a native of Mathura and had divorced her husband six years ago. Police said that Chandrapal and Devi started living together five years ago at a rented apartment in Okhla Industrial Area.
 
 Around a month ago, Munni’s uncle came from her native village to live with her. All was okay between the two, until a woman visited their house a few days ago to meet Munni’s uncle.
 
 “Chandrapal told us that his brief interaction with the woman was not liked by Munni. It resulted in them having frequent quarrels over the past few days,” said the officer.
 
 On Friday evening, Devi served dinner to Chandrapal, but he refused to eat. That led to a heated argument between the couple during which he allegedly picked up an axe and struck her five times.
 
 When other members of the family raised an alarm, Chandrapal fled towards the railway tracks nearby. While some locals kept a track on his location, one of them called the police.
 
 A police team arrived at the crime spot and was directed towards the direction in which Chandrapal had fled. He was later arrested, and the axe used in the   was also recovered.
