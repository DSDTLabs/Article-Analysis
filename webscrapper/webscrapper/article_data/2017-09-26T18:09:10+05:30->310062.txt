If you look at  's recent hairstyle, you'd easily believe that she's got a haircut. She was actually sporting a faux bob hairstyle done by a clever trick. Yes, you read that right. If you love the idea of bob hairdo, but don't want to make a commitment to short hair, then this hack will be your saviour.

 
 This clever hairstyle needs only some twisting and pinning to fake short hair. To copy this style, you can first work on the textureâ€”like curls or straight locks. Once you've got the desired style, pull back the hair into a low and loose ponytail. Now, tie this ponytail with a clear elastic or the one that matches your hair. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Lastly, you would need to twist and push the ponytail underneath, so it looks like a bob hairstyle. Make sure you secure the ponytail with bobby pins so it doesn't come out. You can also pull out a few strands if you don't have front layers like Sonam and you're ready to go!
