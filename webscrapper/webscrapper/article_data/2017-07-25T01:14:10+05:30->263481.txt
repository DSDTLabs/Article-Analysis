THANE: The case of a 32-year-old   and attacked with chemical, allegedly by six familiar persons at Golai Nagar, Kalwa late on Sunday turned out to be a   plotted by the woman’s 13-year-old daughter. 

 The Kalwa police had launched a cross-border hunt to trace three persons, who were falsely accused of raping the woman. The girl is believed to have fabricated the story to get back at their distant relatives, who were reportedly harassing her father.
 
 “The entire rape and chemical attack story was scripted to perfection by this little girl. She had tutored her mother as also her eight-year-old brother to parrot the lines so as to mislead the investigation. To make us believe in her chilling account of the rape, she even poured hot oil on herself to create a wound and cry acid attack blaming the three relatives for the crime they never committed,” said a police officer.
 
 “There were no struggle marks on the woman’s body. Also, her clothes were not torn, only the hooks were broken. We were then sure she had been lying,” he added. 
 
 The higher-ups in the Thane police commissionerate are discussing the action to be taken against the girl and her mother.
