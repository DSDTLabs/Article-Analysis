ALLAHABAD: Even after three fire incidents at the   pandals, the administration is yet to take action against those flouting the  . Despite administration orders, seer camps continue to use five-litre LPG cylinders banned on the mela campus, risking the lives of scores of pilgrims who arrive at the mela to seek salvation. 

  “Last year, at least eight cases of fire outbreak were reported and 15 kalpwasis with burns were admitted to a makeshift hospital in the mela area. But no action was taken. This year, too, authorities have taken no action in this regard,” said a fire safety officer, preferring anonymity.
 
 This year, incidents of fire were reported from camps of   group of seers, Dandi saints and kalwasis, but no casualty has been reported so far. 
 
 To cope with the increasing cases of accidents, the fire department has deployed two fire-fighters and equal number of assistants at each of the 12 fire stations in the mela area. Arrangements of water tanks as well as hydrants have been made to meet any eventuality at the mela.
 
 Chief fire officer,   said, “Kalpwasis and seers camping in the mela are supposed to follow the norms like keeping fire extinguishers, making entry and exit points, keeping buckets full of sand and not to using five litre cylinder. If they are not following the same, it’s the responsibility of the mela administration to look into the issue.”
 
 The mela officer said, “Awareness campaign would be initiated to make those campaigning at the mela to follow the fire safety norms.” Seers should also understand that the guidelines have been framed for their security, he added.
