BHUBANESWAR:   government on Monday issued show cause notice to 26 junior non-government colleges for non-compliance with the eligibility conditions for getting temporary recognition to run the institute.

 
 "It has come to the notice that though these colelges have already completed seven years of temporary recognitions, they failed to comply with the conditions of recognitions. The colleges violated the rules in respect of its own land, building, qualified faculties and well equipped laboratories and libraries within the prescribed time period," the letter issued to the colleges said.
 
 The government has asked the governing bodies of these colleges to explain in writing within 15 days that 'why the temporary recognition so granted to the institute shall not be restricted including restriction on fresh admission'.
 
 Of the 26 colleges maximum eight colleges are in   district followed by four in  , four in  , three in  , two in   and one each in Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Debgarh, Bargarh and Gajapati districts.
 
 "These colleges have been given seven years to develop infrastructure. But they did not follow the rules. Many colleges have litigations in land and building while some are running in rented houses. So the government has to take a tough stand so that the quality could be maintained and others may not get tempted to open new institutions without proper infrastructure and faculty for minting money from students," said a senior officer in the directorate of higher secondary education.
