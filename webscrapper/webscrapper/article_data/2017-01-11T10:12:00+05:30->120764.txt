Rajkot: Alarm bells have been ringing in the coastal district of Jamnagar after 41   (domestic birds) were found dead   in   of Jodiya taluka on Monday afternoon. Officials of the state animal husbandry department rushed to the spot and alerted other government departments for coordinated action. 

 According to animal husbandry department officials, seven samples of birds were collected and sent to a laboratory in Bhopal to ascertain whether the birds were infected with bird flu. The dead birds included 25 spot billed ducks, 12 bar-tailed godwit and two pigeons.
 
 Dr Bhagirath Patel, deputy director of animal husbandry department of Jamnagar, told TOI: “The village sarpanch informed us about the incident on Monday afternoon and we rushed to the spot. We have disposed the dead birds as per the central government guidelines. We have asked the villagers not to use the lake’s water until we get the report on birds’ samples. We have taken all possible precautionary measures after the 41 birds were found dead in Keshiya village. We have also alerted concerned departments across the district to inform the animal husbandry department if they found any bird sick or dead.”
 
 Sources said that forest department, irrigation department and animal husbandry department are working in tandem after the birds were found dead. “We do not want to take any chances after the avian flu was reported in Hathijan village in Ahmedabad last week. We are following   and central government’s guidelines in dealing with avian flu,” said an official.
 
 “We are keeping a close watch on this issue and have advised people not to panic,’’ Dr. Patel said. “Before bird flu was detected in Ahmedabad, we had collected samples of around 150 birds from poultry farms and wild birds and sent them for avian flu test last month as precautionary measures. All the test results were negative,” Patel added.
