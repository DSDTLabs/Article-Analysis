Thane: The Motor Accident Claims   (MACT) awarded a compensation of Rs 13.20 lakh to a couple for the death of their son and daughter, aged 5 and 7 respectively, in a freak mishap, when a   hit a wall, which collapsed on the minor and they died in   in 2014.

 The judge, N N Shrimangale, found that the   policy was fabricated and hence the insurance company was exempted, and only Gopal Gharat, the tempo owner, was told to pay the amount to the parents.
 
 Sudam Pardhi, Sonali, and the deceased, Sameer and his Jyoti, resided at Umbarkhand village. The children were playing in an open place close to their residence, when the tempo was reversing, and it dashed the wall of the house on April 19, 2014, at 2.15pm. Their bodies was buried under the debris of the wall.
 
 They were taken to the civil hospital but doctors declared them dead on arrival. A case was registered at Padgha police station against the driver.
 
 Gharat denied that the driver was negligent. The legal team representing the insurance company pointed out that the policy period was from April 22, 2014 to April 21, 2015, and at the time of accident, the vehicle was not insured. 
 
 Shrimangale pointed out that the FIR was sufficient to prove rash and negligent driving. “There nothing on record to prove that there was contributory negligence on the part of children in the accident,” Shirmangale said.
 
 The judge came down heavily on the owner and said he did not enter the witness box to face cross-examination. “Had he entered the witness box, the truth of the policy would have surfaced. This conduct is sufficient to draw adverse inference against the tempo owner,” the judge said, adding that only he was liable to pay the compensation of Rs 6.60 lakh each for the deceased boy and girl.
