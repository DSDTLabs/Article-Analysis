NAVI MUMBAI: The civic engineering department conducted on-site inspection for demarcation of trees to be cut in order to construct the   connecting Karave village to creek-side of   on Monday. The standing committee approved Rs 1.94 crore for the project.

  plans to construct a 72m long and 7.5m wide underpass to connect the 9m road to the creek but is still to get NOC for diverting motorists from traffic department. 
 
 The underpass is a long-pending demand of Karave village fishermen, as several citizens have died or been injured while trying to cross the   to go to the creek-side for fishing. 
 
 Administration decided to go ahead with the project due to the fatal accidents occurring on the stretch and plan to complete the work before monsoon. Work will begin soon on two of the three lanes on either side of the road. One lane will be kept open for motorists, said an official
 
 The proposal for the underpass was approved by the general body last year but the project has been delayed as the traffic department has still not issued the NOC, said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan. 
 
 “NMMC has sought for NOC at least twice but got no response. Eventually on March 27, we officially intimated that work will commence from April 3,” he added.
 
 The traffic officials are skeptical that the work will be completed by the monsoon, hence, they are not issuing the NOC for safety reasons.
 
 Nitin Pawar, DCP (traffic), said that they have asked NMMC to start the work post monsoon. “If the work is not completed as planned, it could cause accidents during the rains, so we haven’t given the NOC,” he added.
