LUCKNOW: Ever since   was announced from November 8, 2016, the prices of   like potatoes, onions, tomatoes and peas come down by more than 50%. While potatoes have dropped to Rs 10 per kg from earlier Rs 20, rate of peas has reduced from Rs 45 earlier to now just Rs 20. Tomatoes and onions’ prices have also fallen up to 50% because of change shortage among people.

 Surabhi, a resident of Vikasnagar, said, “Most ATMs are generally dispensing a note of Rs 2000 which vegetable vendors refuse to accept. We don’t have change, so vendors are forced to sell their vegetables on credit and at a lower price.”
 
 Since seasonal vegetables are prone to perishing soon, even mandis are selling them at a discounted rate. “Every second buyer comes up with complaint of no change. We have no option but to sell product at cheap rate to clear the stock,” said Rajan Singh, a seller at Narhi Mandi. Another vegetable vendor Gaurav Raikwar from Unnao said that he is selling green-peas and cauliflowers with negligible profit because no is ready to buy them at market’s standard prices.
 
 The   like mushrooms and bell-peppers have seen almost 60% hike in last 50 days because of people not carrying change. In posh areas like Gomtinagar and Niralanagar, vegetable vendors have installed e-wallet system of payment, so people are not facing change problem. But in most other parts, the residents are buying vegetables in large stock to be able to pay them higher note.
 
 Another drawback of demonetisation is since people are not able to buy more stock of vegetables, the vendors are seen mostly selling stale vegetables in colonies. Manya Nirwan of Aliganj says, “My family is fond of eating peas in breakfast. But every morning when I go to buy peas from vendors, they are seen selling stale peas. This is a seasonal vegetable for winters. It is disappointing to buy stale peas.”
