JALANDHAR: The Punjab unit of RSS has reacted strongly to   (AAP) MLA and newly-elected leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s demand that the role of Hindutva forces should also be probed vis-a-vis the recent killing of a pastor in Ludhiana. Stating that Khaira’s statement could break social amity in Punjab, RSS   (state president) Brij Bhushan Singh   asked him to withdraw his statement or face legal action. 

 Bholath MLA Khaira, while addressing a press conference in Ludhiana on Friday, had said though he was not sure of Hindutva forces’ involvement, but police should probe their role.
 
 But in a statement issued here on Saturday, Bedi said Khaira levelled false allegations against the Sangh and VHP for political mileage. “He has lowered the prestige of his post and and his statement can damage social amity in the state. Sangh does not believe in violence and respects all religious heads,” he said.
 
 Bedi also said that Sangh members sacrificed their their lives for the unity and integrity of the country and just a year ago, they lost its Prant Seh Sanghchalak (state vice-president) Brigadier  . “Khaira should apologize to people for his objectionable statement or the Sangh would take legal action against him,” Bedi said. He also said Punjab had high expectations from the young leader of opposition but such statements dented his image.
