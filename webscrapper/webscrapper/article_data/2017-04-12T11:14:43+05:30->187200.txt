NAGPUR: The   ( ) does not know where 58% of the city’s potable water is being supplied everyday. The total quantum of water loss comes to 415 million litres per day (MLD), which is enough to meet the requirement of ten cities like  , that count every single drop of water due to the acute scarcity.

 This is happening despite spending over Rs 1,000 crore on infrastructure development works, including 24X7 water supply project, in last seven years and appointment of private water operator   five years ago. Unfortunately, the cash-strapped civic body is also incurring a huge financial loss along with loss of the natural resource, since it pays OCW as per the total water supplied.
 
 NMC data says the water billing for 2016-17 was 300 MLD while actual supply was 715 MLD, indicating a direct loss of 415 MLD potable water. Unfortunately, the water losses are increasing instead of reducing.
 
 TOI had, on April 3, 2016, highlighted water losses were at 380 MLD in 2015-16. The water supply was 680 MLD in 2015-16 and billing was at 300 MLD. Since then, the water supply has increased by 35 MLD due to rise in supply from Pench-IV water treatment plant. However, the water billing has not increased.
 
 As per central government thumb rule, 135 litres water should be supplied per person per day in urban areas. Going by this formula, NMC’s water supply of 715 MLD can fulfil requirement of 53 lakh people, double the existing population of the city. However, many areas in the city are still facing a water crisis.
 
 The OCW spokesperson told TOI that water billing increased by 130 MLD since OCW took over water works. “Water billing was 170 MLD when OCW started services on March 1, 2012. Now, the water billing is 300 MLD. OCW started three major drives — conversion of average to regular meter replacement, unregistered to registered meter drive, and NIT layout meter replacement drive. Results of this are evident from the fact that consumer data base increased to 3.12 lakh from 1.70 lakh,” he said.
 
 Water supply was 540 MLD when OCW took over water works. Now, the water supply has increased to 715 MLD, a rise of 175 MLD, which shows water losses increased by 45 MLD in OCW regime.
 
 The NMC’s expense on water works is around Rs193 crore per annum. The revenue in 2016-17 was Rs122 crore, resulting in a loss of Rs71 crore.
 
 Municipal commissioner   did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages.
 
 An NMC official from water works department said water losses will go down once 24X7 water project is completed. “New water network and meters are being ensured in the project. Losses are due to leakages and unaccounted water supply. These will come down on completion of the project,” he said.
