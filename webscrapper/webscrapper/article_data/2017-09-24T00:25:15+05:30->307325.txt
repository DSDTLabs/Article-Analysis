New Delhi: A month after a doctor at St Stephens   was stabbed to death by a fellow doctor, police on Saturday have prepared sketches of the   wearing a turban. They suspect that he has changed his look to evade arrest.

 Police hired a graphic artist to prepare the probable facial changes the man might have undergone and have circulated them to get information about his whereabouts. A reward of Rs 50,000 has also been declared on the accused, Suyash Gupta, who has been changing locations to evade arrest.
 
 Meanwhile, the family members of the victim, Shashwat Pandey, will be holding a protest march at Jantar Mantar on Sunday seeking justice. 
 
 Jatin Narwhal, DCP (north), said police teams had last tracked Gupta to Anand Vihar ISBT from where he allegedly left the city. He had updated his Facebook status saying “It was a nice stay in India”, which led police to suspect that he must have left the country. He had also withdrawn Rs 5 lakh before fleeing. 
 
 However, sources said that a look-out-notice was put out soon after the incident and the possibilities of him leaving the country was less. 
 
 Police said they have recovered the murder weapon — a military knife — that Gupta had bought online. Police now suspect that he could still be in the country assuming a different identity, possibly a Sikh man, travelling as a medical representative. Gupta’s bank accounts have been freezed and police have also written to MCI for cancellation of his registration as practitioner.
 
 Gupta was probably planning the murder for nearly two months since his suspension from the college. His last update on WhatsApp was “Morghon naejot qrinuntys olvie aderi” (death in front of enemy may come soon), police said.
 
 Police have so far raided over a dozen cities where Gupta has any links. “We are taking help from software experts also to get clues from his online activities which might be coded,” said a senior police officer.
