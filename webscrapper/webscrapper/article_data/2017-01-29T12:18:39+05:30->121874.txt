After   joined practically the entire Hindi film industry for a cameo in the title song of  's 'Om Shanti Om' in 2007, Mirror has learnt that the latter is now returning the favour for  's Sallu-starrer 'Tubelight'.

  
  
 Initially slated to shoot in December, SRK's schedule was postponed to this month owing to both the actors' busy schedules. "SRK plays a pivotal role and will be shooting through Sunday night for his portions," informs a source close to the development.
 
 The 'Tubelight' team has been shooting at Mumbai's   where Kabir has recreated a hill station for the film's last schedule, after Manali and Ladakh. The two Khans have previously shared screen space in 'Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam', 'Karan Arjun' and 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai', among others. 'Tubelight' marks their big screen reunion after 10 years.
 
 Meanwhile, SRK is also slated to make an appearance on Sallu's reality show, ahead of his new film, the Rahul Dholakia directed 'Raees' release over the Republic Day weekend. The duo recently shot for a promo for the two-episode segment. A source from the sets reveals that they shot at Mehboob studios and SRK came in with wife Gauri and younger son AbRam. "Salman greeted him with a hug and made suggestions about improvising bits for the promo. Shah Rukh had to leave early for  's upcoming film so the promo shoot was wrapped up in an hour," adds the source.
