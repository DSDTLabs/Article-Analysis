PANAJI: If all goes well, students in Goa may soon be able to get benefit from   for those who   of  .

 A proposal to this effect was announced by minister for art and culture   on Wednesday.
 
 The concept is along similar lines of claiming sports marks in exam results. Just like students participating in sports activities are given these marks, the contribution of students engaging in art and culture should also be considered, said Gaude.
 
 “I will ensure that students working in art and culture activities receive grace marks,” he said while speaking on the sidelines of the launch of a scheme titled, ‘Gaansaraswati Kishoritai Amonkar Research Fellowship in Indian classical music’.
 
 He said that while the extra marks are useful to students, but the policy should be such that it doesn't compromise the rank of another meritorious student.
 
 Without naming anyone in particular, he said, "A student recently got 96-97% and after adding sports marks crossed the 100% mark. This devalues the worth of attaining 100%. It is also injustice to the student who has scored well solely in academics,” Gaude said.
 
 “We will discuss these parameters and decide how to grant marks for participation in art and culture activities, besides studies. It will also be decided whether a student can avail marks for both sports and art and culture activities or either one,” he added.
 
 Asked, by when this move will be implemented, he said, "We are still in the primary stage of this initiative. Nothing has been decided yet."
 
 Also present at the launch, director for art and culture,   said, "There are students who participate in art and culture activities and win accolades at the national level. This initiative is to give them grace marks for such prestigious achievements."
