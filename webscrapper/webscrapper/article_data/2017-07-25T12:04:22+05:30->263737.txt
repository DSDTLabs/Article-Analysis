AHMEDABAD: A commercial court in the city has turned down an application filed by a labelling company requesting the court to restrain a packaging company from using the word ‘Maharshi’ in its trade name on the grounds that it has registered trademark in this name. 

 In the legal battle in the commercial court, Maharshi   had taken exception to the use of the word ‘Maharshi’ by   by claiming its right over the trademark. It approached the court to restrain   from using the word ‘Maharshi’ as it had registered ‘Maharshi Udyog’ with the trademark registrar.
 
 After hearing the case, commercial court judge R T Vachhani, on July 5, had rejected Maharshi Udyog’s application on the ground that the company cannot claim exclusive right on word ‘Maharshi’.
 
 After failing to convince the lower court, last week,   approached the high court. In the commercial court Maharshi Packaging had opposed the application on the ground that ‘Maharshi’ is not a word that is coined by the applicant. It is a generic and common name that means sage or saint. It argued that a company cannot claim trademark or trade name over a common word. Moreover, there are hundreds of companies which use the word ‘Maharshi’ as prefix or suffix in their trade names. 
 
 Maharshi Udyog cited an undertaking given in 2014 by a former partner of Maharshi Packaging that they will not use the word. But the company opposed this stand arguing that the partner who promised this had already parted his way with the company. Moreover, the trademark registered is ‘Maharshi Udyog’ and not the word ‘Maharshi’, whereas Maharshi Packaging stands for a completely different business. Moreover, Maharshi Udyog uses this as a house-mark and not trademark.
