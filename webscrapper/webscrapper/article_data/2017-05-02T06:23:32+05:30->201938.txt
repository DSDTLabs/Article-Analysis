UDAIPUR: A 20-year old boy and 17-year old girl shot themselves near a temple place at   in   district in the wee hours of Monday. The boy died in the civil hospital while the girl is admitted in Udaipur hospital in serious condition. Love affair is said to be the reason behind the suicide, however, the family members of the couple said they didn't know about their relationship. 

 The couple had even made a video before shooting themselves explaining the reason behind the act and tried to post it on social media but the uploading failed, police said. Cops have found a pen drive and 6 suicide notes, one each at their homes and four from the area where they shot themselves. Two letters were written by the girl and rest by the boy.
 
 "We were informed that Vinod, son of Dashrath Kumawat and Manisha, daughter of Kushali Ram Raidas had shot themselves and they were taken to the district hospital. Vinod died there but Manisha was referred to Udaipur. The couple left suicide notes behind in which they said they were killing themselves of their own will and no one had forced them for this," Pratapgarh SP Kaluram Rawat told TOI. 
 
 According to sources, the couple left home after Sunday midnight and went to the Devnarayan   (small temple) where they even made a visual clip of their confession. Vinod's father told the police that he was out of station and around 2.45 am he came to know about the incident when a neighbor called him. "Prima facie it appears Vinod shot Manisha first and then shot himself. They used a 'desi katta' to shoot. We are investigating on how they got the weapon," Rawat said. According to sources, Vinod was into much religious activities at the Devra and acted as 'Bhopa'. The girl's family was opposed to her involvement, which was the reason for their suicide, villagers said.
