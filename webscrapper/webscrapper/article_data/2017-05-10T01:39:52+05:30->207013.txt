Lucknow: In a statement that would put four-time Gorakhpur MLA Dr Radha Mohan Das Agrawal on backfoot, UP government spokesman   said on Tuesday that every people’s representative should exercise restraint while speaking. 

 Agrawal had allegedly indulged in a heated exchange of words with a trainee IPS Charu Nigam, posted as Gorakhnath CO. The dispute had resulted in a major controversy with the IPS trainee officer seen in tears.
 
 “He (Agarwal) is a senior leader and a representative of the people. The police may have behaved in a certain manner but we should exercise restraint in saying anything,” Sharma said. 
 
 On Saharanpur, Sharma said the incident had been taken up with all seriousness and things would normalise soon.
