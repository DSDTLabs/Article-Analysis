KOLKATA: The Lake Town traffic guard on Thursday launched a special three-and-a-half hour drive on VIP Road — between Kaikhali and   — armed with a  . The whole idea was to curb speeding. At the end of the drive, over 50 challans were issued.

 Two days ago, a TOI report highlighted the problems that possibly resulted in multiple accidents over the past week on the stretch.
 
 “There are different speed limits on this stretch of the VIP Road connecting Ultadanga with airport. This depends on the road width and crossings. There are stretches where the speed limit has been fixed at 50 km/hr. For the past one month, we have been trying to instil speed sense among motorists. However, our officers were often challenged by motorists claiming they were being falsely implicated for speeding. Hence, we decided to employ the speed-gun so that we have proof of the speed and catch those breaking the law red-handed,” an official said.
 
 Police sources said if anybody is found involved in rash driving, cops will slap a fine ranging anywhere between Rs 100 to Rs 500, depending on whether the motorists are found to be repeat offenders. It has also been decided that in extreme cases of rash driving, cops will slap harsher charges under   sections. “There was no such case registered on Thursday,” said an officer.
 
 “Once the gun sets its eye on the road, it captures the image of the approaching vehicle. It also captures the speed at which the vehicle is crossing. In case of violation, it will alert the traffic personnel,” said a police officer.
