CHENNAI: More than 40 days after sharing an abusive and offensive   post about woman journalists, comedy actor and   functionary S   failed to earn any reprieve in the  .

 
 The apex court refused to grant anticipatory bail to the actor on Friday and, instead, directed him to surrender before a judicial magistrate in court in Chennai and seek regular bail there. The court had earlier stayed Shekher’s arrest.
 
 But on Friday, vacating the interim stay, a vacation bench of Justice L   and Mohan M Shantanagoudar directed Shekher to surrender before the jurisdictional magistrate.
 
 During arguments, Tamil Nadu government’s counsel submitted that chargesheet in the case had already been filed by the prosecution. Recording the submission, the court directed the actor to appear before the judicial magistrate and seek regular bail.
 
 The actor had on April 20 shared the controversial facebook post targeting woman journalists, triggering protests and court cases by journalists. When went underground and moved the high court for anticipatory bail, apprehending arrest in the case, journalists joined in as interveners and opposed bail for him.
 
 On May 10, the Madras high court dismissed his bail application with caustic remark: “If sharing bed is the only way for women to come up in life (as per Shekher’s FB post), then does it include all women who are holding high posts now?”
 
 Addressing another important issue concerning social media posts, the court said, “forwarding a message is equal to accepting the message and endorsing it.”
