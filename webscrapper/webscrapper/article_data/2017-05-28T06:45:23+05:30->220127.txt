LUCKNOW: Still grappling with the emergence of Dalit outfit Bhim Sena,   chief Mayawati on Saturday saw another challenge emerge when expelled BSP leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui formed his own political outfit called   

 Siddiqui, who was shown the door by Mayawati on charges of anti-party activities on May 10, said that his Morcha would conduct state-wide mass contact programmes to mobilize people associated with the ‘Bahujan movement’. 
 
 “A conspiracy is being hatched to weaken the ideology of Ambedkar and BSP founder Kanshiram. The Morcha would try to take on such political outfits,” he said. In an indirect attack on Mayawati, Siddiqui said that a few political leaders were misguiding Dalits in the name of Bahujan.
 
 The Morcha will have representation from all communities, he said. While Siddiqui will be convener of the Morcha, former BSP leader Brahm Swaroop Sagar, a Jatav, has been appointed co-convener. Likewise, former BSP MLA OP Singh, a Thakur and former state minister in the BSP regime Acchey Lal Nishad, an MBC, have also been made co-conveners.
 
 Siddiqui, however, is yet to give any position to his son Afzal who was also expelled from the BSP.
 
 Sources said the Morcha will soon approach the   to get itself registered as a political party. Plans are also afoot to launch a state-wide ‘BSP chhoro andolan’.
 
 The members of the Morcha said the forum would provide a platform to the disgruntled members of the BSP.
 
 Siddiqui had engaged in a war of words with Mayawati after he was expelled from the party. While Siddiqui came out with audio tapes purportedly about Mayawati seeking money from party functionaries, the latter shot back saying that Siddiqui was a ‘taping black mailer’. 
 
 Siddiqui has since been touring the state and meeting his supporters, many of them still in the BSP.
