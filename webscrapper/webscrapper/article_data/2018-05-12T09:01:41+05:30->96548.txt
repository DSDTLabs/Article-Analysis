  : The   has demanded that the state government do away with the continuous and comprehensive evaluation ( ) system. 

 In a letter to the Commissioner and Director of   department, APPSA state chairman   said that there is the possibility of malpractice for the internal marks in the CCE pattern. 
 
 "There was a great unrest among both the students and teachers. It will be better if the system is revoked in 2018-19 academic year for the sake of the students, teachers, parents and managements. Though the motives of the CCE are good, it is not so easy to implement right now since it needs a lot of awareness. If there is no proper awareness, it will become a wild-goose-chase only," said Murthy.
