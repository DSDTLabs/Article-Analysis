JAIPUR: State BJP president   on Thursday claimed that by criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move, it was the Congress which was losing out on support of the people.
“Demonetisation has been well-received by everyone despite the fact that people did face a few hardships. However, everybody supports it as it has helped curb corruption and deal with terrorism and black-money. The Congress by criticising it is only losing out on public support,'' said Parnami, in response to the country-wide protest to demonetisation planned by the Congress party .
 
 Reacting to former chief minister  's demand for a public debate on the performance of the Raje government, Parnami said that the Assembly provided the platform for all debates between elected representatives. “Like pointed out by senior cabinet minister  , in a democratic setup, assembly is the pla ce for all debates. If he (Gehlot) has an issue, he should raise in in the house,'' said Parnami.
 
 Parnami was addressing a media briefing following a meeting of the state party's executive members and district presidents on Thursday , where the party members held discussions on strengthening the party ahead of the 2018 assembly polls. `Òur focus now is the 2018 assembly polls and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. We will strengthen our party and all its wings including the booth level committees,'' said Parnami.
 
 When asked about a disciplinary action against senior BJP legislator  , he said, that the process was a lengthy one and the recommendation came from the disciplinary committee. “When a decision is taken, everyone will know,'' he said. Tiwari has been vocal against the party decisions and Vasundhara Rajeled government in the state.
