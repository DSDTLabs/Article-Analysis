BHOPAL: Though not so vocal about the   like in the past, yoga guru-turned-entrepreneur Baba Ramdev said the government should reconsider the Rs 2,000 currency note, introduced  . Even if the Congress seeks my support for some good work, I would extend support to that party, he said.

 Talking to media in Bhopal on Monday, Ramdev said the Rs 2,000 note is not good for economy of any country. Asked to explain, he said, currency notes in big denomination become a medium for crime. Drug dealers, terrorists and   use them. That was the reason why Prime Minister   had withdrawn them. This is why the government should reconsider Rs 2,000 notes in coming days,” he said in somewhat a guarded manner.
 
 Asked why he has been vague about the black money and that it has to be brought back from abroad, a stand he took in the past, Ramdev said, “sadhu sant ko nirmohi hona chaheeye” (a sant should be detached). The yoga guru says: “He had supported Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and there was no hidden agenda. I did it khullam khulla (openly). That was the time of political disappointment and people were frustrated with scams.” 
 
 Ramdev said he had already been raising the issue of black money and Modi told me “he is with me.. not 100%, but 200% on the issue.” “Modi said if his party won the election, it would bring back the black money and stamp out the corruption. I trusted him. I still trust him,” he said. Modi has been in power for three years and two years are still left. His track record shows whatever he commits he delivers, Ramdev said.
