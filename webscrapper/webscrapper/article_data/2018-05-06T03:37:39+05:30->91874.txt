MUMBAI: A 38-year-old man from Vasai has been sentenced to life imprisonment for sexually abusing his two minor nieces and impregnating one of them.Babloo Yadav was on Friday found guilty of the crime. Special Judge N G Pradhan of the Vasai court sentenced Yadav to life imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs 17,000 on him. 

 Yadav was having an affair with the sisters' mother while their father, Yadav's elder brother, was bed ridden at their native town in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 In 2012, Yadav, who is unmarried, brought the girls aged 14 and 17, along with their mother and two other siblings, to stay with him in Vasai. Yadav began sexually abusing the 14-year-old niece when her mother left for work as a housemaid. He impregnated the girl and forced her to undergo an abortion in Uttar Pradesh. Her mother, elder sister, younger sister and brother were unaware of the sexual abuse.
 
 In December 2014, Yadav tried to sexually abuse his 17- year-old niece. However, she raised an alarm and alerted the neighbours.
 
 The girls' mother lodged a police complaint against Yadav, a vada pav vendor, at Valiv police station in Vasai (east) after which Yadav was arrested.
 
 His arrest gave the 14-year-old the courage to speak up. She told the police about the rape and abortion by Yadav. This shocked the elder sister. Yadav was charged with rape, molestation and under relevant sections of the POCSO Act. He was lodged in Thane jail. 
 
 Assistant public prosecutor Kadambini Khandangale examined five witnesses. The mother, who is the complainant in the case, failed to turn up in court during the trial. The court relied on the statements of the sisters besides their medical tests.
