For the first time ever, Ilaiyaraaja and his sons,   and  , will be composing together for a film. They will be composing for the Vijay Sethupathi-starrer  , which will be directed by National Award-winner Seenu Ramasamy. Close on the heels of the maestro receiving the Padma Vibhushan,   chose to announce this collaboration on Twitter.

 We spoke to Seenu on this development, and he said, “This happened entirely because of Yuvan’s initiative. He was very impressed with the script of Maamanithan and so wanted to do something special for it. He asked   and myself if we would be OK if he composes the music along with Raaja sir and Karthik, and we were overjoyed. I see this as a gift for me from Yuvan.”
 Talking about the film, he said, “The film is an emotional drama about a man who values, respects and admires his relations.” He added that the rest of the cast and crew hasn’t been finalised yet. “I’m starting the shoot of  , my film with Udhayanidhi and Tamannaah, in the next couple of days. Once I wrap up the film, we are planning to begin the shoot of Maamanithan, most probably by May,” he revealed.
 
 "On this day when the great man has been conferred Padma Vibhushan by the Government of India, we are glad to announce the inclusion of the maestro in our project. The title Maamanithan gets a meaning now. Beyond being his son, I attach a lot of pride in being his fan, too. I have learnt the art of music from him, privileged enough to learn it from close quarters being his son. Now, as a producer, my heart is filled with joy having him on board. The very thought of co-composing with him and my brother,   Raja, makes my journey of being a music director more meaningful and purposeful," said Yuvan.
