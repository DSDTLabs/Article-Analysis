 The boys, who live in South City 2 and studied at  , Sector 46, shared each other’s notes for studying till Class X. “I and Abhay have done our schooling together. We used to copy each other’s notes. We have done well in the exam because we don’t like to miss classes,” Shubham said.
 
 In Class XI, Shubham opted for the science stream, while Abhay chose commerce. But this didn’t hamper their studies. “Even though we had different subjects, we would sit together and ask each other questions. This helped us prepare for the board exams in better way,” said Abhay. “Till Class X, we were not serious about studies, but when we reached Class XI, we had a talk and decided to take our studies seriously. It was then that both of us started dedicating four to five hours daily to our studies,” Shubham said.
