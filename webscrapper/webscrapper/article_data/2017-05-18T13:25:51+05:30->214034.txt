But Mirror has learnt that one of the major changes it is set to undergo is a replacement for  . Both   Bachchan and   have been approached to take over as the new host. 

  
  
 A source from the channel said, "Mr Bachchan's daughter-in-law Aishwarya is among those who has been approached to take over as quiz master for season nine. The channel is in talks with both Madhuri and Aishwarya." Bachchan's tenure as host had been interrupted when Shah Rukh Khan took over in season three. In all these years, 'KBC' has never been hosted by a female celebrity and the channel is considering Aishwarya and Madhuri because they want to bring some novelty to the familiar format.
 
 We reached out to both Aishwaya and Madhuri's spokespersons but they chose not to comment.
