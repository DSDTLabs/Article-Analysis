MYSURU: Inspired by  , Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cleanliness initiative, a Mysuru-based businessman has turned a stretch of the street in front of his house into a garden. Pleased with his handiwork, he sent a mail to   with details on his project and, to his great surprise, Modi replied seeking more information.

 Pradeep Kumar AD, who runs a hardware store on Ashoka Road, resides with his family just behind Decathlon in Venkatalingaiah Layout. Pradeep always had a healthy environmental streak and for years nurtured a terrace garden. He mostly grew flowering plants and a few vegetables like tomatoes. However, he always wanted to do more. Inspired by Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, he decided to turn the street in front of his house into a ‘green’ street.
 
 “I was inspired by PM Modi’s concept of Swachh Bharat and decided to contribute to society in my locality,” Pradeep told TOI. Pradeep had previously got students from   (CAVA) to decorate the walls of his house with artwork, but this time he hired painter Sai Krishna Shetty to paint the compound walls on the street, depicting wild animals, colourful birds and tribal art.
 
 On December 12, Pradeep mailed a letter to PM Modi explaining what he had done to transform his neighbourhood. Great was Pradeep’s surprise when Modi’s office replied to his letter on January 2, lauding Pradeep for his work and asking him to provide details along with photos of his initiative.
