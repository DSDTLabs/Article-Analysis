NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Thursday found no merit in a batch of petitions challenging State Election Commission’s (SEC) delimitation exercise for next month’s municipal polls.

 A bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Chander Shekhar said it was satisfied with the stand of the commission and dismissed the petitions.
 
  The court referred to the redrawing of wards for scheduled caste and women candidates and concluded that the criteria was based on population density of an area and the 2011 census data.
 
 The court said there was no illegality in the manner in which the commission went about its task and also pointed out that before coming out with fresh wards, it had consulted all stakeholders after inviting their objections beforehand.
 
 The petitions had sought quashing of the notification laying down criteria for allocation of wards for reserved categories and women in the upcoming polls to be held on April 23.
 
 The court upheld State Election Commission’s decision and said it did not violate any provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act or Article 243 of the Constitution of India.
 
 It also maintained that there is no merit in the pleas by NGOs and several social activists, who have sought quashing of the notification laying down the manner of allocation of wards for reserved categories and women.
 
 The commission through standing counsel Sumeet Pushkarna had informed the court about exhaustive satellite imagery surveys and 2011 census to justify its stand.
