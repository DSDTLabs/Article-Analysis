HYDERABAD: People suffering from   (PAH) can delay the onset of  , including damage to heart and lungs if they walk for six minutes a day for six months, reveals a new study by a team of researchers from abroad as well as Hyderabad. The study was published in the latest issue of the science journal, PLoS One.

 PAH puts extra pressure on the heart to pump blood to lungs and thus the patients get tired easily. Unlike the systemic or normal hypertension where the pressure in the blood vessels is high, PAH is a   affecting the arteries of the lungs.
 
 The study revealed that six-minute walk, a test commonly prescribed by doctors for those suffering with PAH, is effective in controlling future health issues related to heart and lungs. The research team was drawn from about a dozen institutions across the world, including  , São Paulo in Brazil, the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, California and Care Hospitals, Hyderabad.
 
 The researchers found that patients with PAH walking more than 400 metres had lower risk of disease progression, including   or hospitalization and all-cause death. “Patients with PAH who achieve a six-minute walk distance of 380 to 440 metres may have improved prognosis,” researchers said.
 
 Stating that PAH is a “relentlessly progressive disease leading to right ventricular failure and poor survival”, the researchers noted that six-minute walk test is a simple and reproducible measure of exercise capacity. Data from observational studies and randomized trials suggest that absolute values of six-minute walk are associated with better prognosis, As part of the study the patients were divided into two groups – those walking for more than six minutes and those less than six minutes – to assess future risk of PAH-related death or hospitalization and all-cause death. Patients with a six-minute walk distance of over 400 metres at the end of six months showed reduced risk.
