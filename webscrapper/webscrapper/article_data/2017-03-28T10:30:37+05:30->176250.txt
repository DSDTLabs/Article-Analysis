Panaji: The state cabinet on Monday granted six months extension to five off-shore casinos to operate in River Mandovi. The permission given to five off-shore casinos to operate in the river ends on March 31.

 Five existing off-shore casinos that got six more months to move away from   (M V Horseshoe),   (M V Pride of Goa), M/s Highstreet Cruises and Entertainment (M V Royale),   (M V Boa Sorte) and   (M V  ).
 
 The cabinet meeting in March 2014, renewed licences of off-shore casinos that were expiring on or before March 31, 2014, by two years to allow them to make alternative arrangements to move out of the Mandovi river.
 
 The cabinet had also resolved that licences of all those off-shore casinos which were expiring after March 31, 2014, shall not be renewed for operation in River Mandovi.
 
 The cabinet, then, had also agreed not to allow any more off-shore casinos in the state.
 
 Subsequently, the government had started looking out for alternative sites to shift the off-shore casinos. 
 
 Alternative sites in River Zuari,   and Chapora and Sal were also identified. But, the proposal to shift the casino vessels to an alternative site never saw the light of day during the last two years. In fact, the proposal was shot down on grounds that it was unviable.
