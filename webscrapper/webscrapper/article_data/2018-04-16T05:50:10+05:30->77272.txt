CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu   and   might be delayed this year as teacher associations have boycotted the  , pressing for their demands pertaining to pension scheme and pay. 

 Evaluation of Class XII answer scripts, which began on April 12, is already taking a hit from the protests. Protesting teachers announced that they will completely abstain from work from April 24, if their demands are not met. More than two million students from Class X to XII sat the board exams this year, and a total of 74 evaluation camps have been set up.
 
 This is an extension of the massive protests by members of the JACTO-GEO last September and this January, pressing for their 11-point charter of demands. The demands have now shrunk to six points with the protesters threatening to not only boycott evaluation but also prevent other teachers from entering the camps. Scrapping the new pension scheme and revivingold one, pay on a par with central government-funded schoolteachers, releasing seventh pay commission arrears (due for 21 months) and regularising consolidated pay are their primary demands.
 
 Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers' Organisations (JACTTO), a new confederation of more than 15 associations, including the prominent Tamil Nadu graduate teachers' association, informed the state school education department and directorate of government examinations last week of the boycott, the group's general secretary   told TOI. 
 
 In response, a senior official from the school education department said the government was looking into the demands and efforts are on to arrive at an amicable solution so that the evaluation process is not delayed.
