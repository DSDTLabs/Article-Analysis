JAIPUR: In an attempt to help   and beat  ,   (DIET) -a body under state education department -to offer  ,  , conference rooms, computer libraries at DIET offices in many districts to private schools.

 The government has decided to generate income by taking nominal fees from the private school in lieu of these aforesaid services.
 
 The move is an outcome after state education department has made DIET and State Institute for Education Research and Training (SIERT) autonomous bodies in terms of generating funds by running programs and renting out facilities. The role of DIET is to provide pre-service teachers training, in service training and conducting exams for Class V and VIII in government schools while it is optional for private school students. Both DIET and SIERT are being funded by state government which spends 92% of the total budget on meeting salaries of teachers.
 
 “Other than giving a window to DIETs for generating income, it will be an opportunity for private schools to improve their quality of teaching along with enhancing syllabus,“ said state education minister Vasudev Devnani while explaining the multi-faceted objectives of offering training and facilities. Rajasthan has about 35,000 private schools, most of them are low budget which don't have facilities or spent on teachers training.This is the reason that learning outcomes of private schools is also not impressive.
 
 The DIETS are also planning to offer special training programs for students in their smart classes which will improve learning outcome of students in private schools. Padma Saxena, principal of Jaipur DIET said, “Most of the facilities are in poor condition and due to scarcity of resources we have not been able to carry several functions. Renting out of facilities will generate income.This income will be monitored by DIET development and management committee,“ said Saxena.
