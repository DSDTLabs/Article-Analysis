CHENNAI: Despite Chennai being the third largest city in India with high air pollution, the state government has not thought it fit to release subsidies for autorickshaws plying on the city’s roads to convert to LPG from petrol, said the  . LPG as a fuel is considered cleaner than petrol.

 “The indecision of the state government in non-release of subsidy has affected the conversion of petrol driven autorickshaws to LPG vehicles,” said the CAG report.
 
 Despite a government order in April 2007, a decade later the government still has not made any leeway. As per the original plan, autorickshaws were to install LPG kits with new permits following subsidies given by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for each conversion.
 
 In November 2008, a TNPCB high-level committee suggested that the green tax collected from old vehicles be used for granting subsidies. “Even though Rs 136.13 crore has been collected by the state as green tax, such conversions have not been effected,” the CAG said.
 
 The government has sought to follow the methods of the Delhi government in getting more petrol-driven autos to switch to LPG in December 2016. A report is awaited in this regard. “Since the emission of smoke from motor vehicles is a major source of air pollution, the delay in implementing the scheme has contributed to continued air pollution, beyond permissible limits,” said the CAG.
 
 But a problem with large scale adoption of LPG vehicles is the lack of infrastructure, say dealers. India has about 56,190 fuel outlets of which 1,073 stations distribute LPG, according to data with Indian LPG Auto Coalition. When it comes to Tamil Nadu, in total the state has 4,702 petrol pumps of which only 148 stations have LPG.
 
 “For large scale adoption, we must have infrastructure and availability of fuel in place. Indian Oil has more than 2,000 petrol pumps in the city, but very few cater to the LPG segment,” said an Indian Oil spokesperson.
