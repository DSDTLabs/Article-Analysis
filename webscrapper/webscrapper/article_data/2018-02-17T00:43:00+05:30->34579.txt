Madurai: Passengers at the Madurai international airport will no more have to get handbags tagged by the airline and stamped by security personnel as these age-old security features have been done away with. Airport authorities said that the change had come into force on February 10 after a week-long trial run which was successful. 

 The new method was implemented after the customary nod from Airports Authority of India and Bureau of Civil Aviation, the regulatory authority for civil aviation security in the country. Earlier, passengers had to ensure that their handbag was tagged while getting the boarding pass from the concerned airline. During security check, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel used to stamp the tag after the bag was screened. This stamping was again checked before the passengers were allowed to board the flight. 
 
 “It will significantly save time. On many occasions passengers might forget to get the tag and had to return to the respective airline counter. For those who hurry at the last minute, this was an issue,” said Madurai airport director V V Rao.
