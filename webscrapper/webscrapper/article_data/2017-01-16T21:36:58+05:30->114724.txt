The year has just begun and the alleged animosity between the office bearers of the   and the Tamil Film Producers��� Council (TFPC) has taken a new turn. With the tenure of the present office-bearers of  , led by Kalaipuli S Thanu, coming to an end, Nadigar Sangam secretary and actor   made a surprise announcement that actress-politician-producer   will be the presidential candidate for his team for the upcoming election to the council, which is slated for February 5. 

 In November 2016, Vishal was temporarily suspended from the TFPC for criticising the council in an interview to a magazine ��� for saying that it was more interested in solving remuneration issues through katta panchayat than more important ones like piracy, and finding new avenues to augment revenue. He had also informed of his plans to contest the next TFPC elections in the interview.
 
 This, and his present announcement that   will be contesting for the post of the president in the TFPC elections, has led to speculations that the actor is trying to settle his personal scores with the TFPC through Khushbu. 
 
 However, when we contacted Khushbu, the actress maintained that the decision to contest was hers and not Vishal���s. Hitting out at speculations, she said, ���I don���t care what others have to say. I think we are here to do a good job and we are here to set a few things straight. And that���s what I am going to focus on. The way people talk, I think they are trying to make me a scapegoat for Vishal. But this is what I have to say to all the naysayers...I am a well-educated woman who has a mind of her own. So, it is not Vishal who made me contest this election; it is I who decided to do so. I am an individual who has her head in the right place.��� 
 
 As for her political work coming in the way of her work in the TFPC, if elected, she said, ���The state elections are two years away. But I will strike a balance and give them equal attention.���
