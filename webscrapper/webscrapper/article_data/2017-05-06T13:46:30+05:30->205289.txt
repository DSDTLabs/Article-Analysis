A 30-year-old female advocate, who had climbed up 16 floors of an under construction building in Azad Nagar, Wadala, apparently to commit suicide was rescued in a nail-biting experience for those involved.Police said the woman was upset with her family for allegedly forcing her to marry a man of their choice.

 On Friday morning, the woman, a local resident, perched herself on a ledge on the highrise. After she had spent nearly three hours in that precarious position, the police reached the spot. It took another five hours for the cops to bring her down.
 
 Sources said the woman suffers from chronic depression. She walked in through the gate of the building and went to the16th floor of the17storey structure and positioned herself on the ledge. “Locals spotted her around 10 am and alerted us,“ said Senior Inspector   of   police station.
 
 Police said the woman threatened to jump if anyone tried to come near her. The police then tried to distract her while some women constables and fire officials rushed up the stairs. The cops then roped in Inspector  , an expert counsellor, to save the woman.
 
 “I just focused on talking to her and buying time,“ Sharma said.
 
 As Sharma kept the woman distracted with a conversation, rescue officials managed to get close enough to be able to rescue her.
 
 Bansod said, “It appears she wanted to pick a groom of her choice rather than being forced into marriage. She was apparently under pressure from the family to get married and this aggravated her condition.“
