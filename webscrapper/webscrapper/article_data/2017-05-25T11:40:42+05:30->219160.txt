DEHRADUN: Around   have reached Govindghat in   for the Hemkund Sahib yatra — the revered   of Hemkund, 15,000-foot above  , near Badrinath — which is   from Thursday.
 
  According to district administration, the trekking route to the shrine has been repaired and arrangements have been made for the photometric registration of the pilgrims.
  
  Joshimath sub-divisional magistrate Yoginder Singh told TOI, “Sri Hemkund Sahib gurdwara will open around 8 am on Thursday. All arrangements for smooth darshan have been made. The rates of jeeps, ponies, etc, have been fixed and a rate chart signage has been installed near photometric registration centre.”
  
  “Besides, guidelines have been issued for two-wheeler drivers. Not more than one pillion will be allowed on a motorcycle. Except Sikhs, wearing helmet is mandatory for all.
  
  According to rituals, gurdwara granthis take dip in the holy Hemkund sarovar, following which the Guru Granth Sahib is brought for a procession led by Panj Pyare and set up in the gurdwara. This is followed by main ‘ardaas’ (prayer) and summed up with a ‘langar’ (mass kitchen).
  The devotees will have to trek down for Govindghat by afternoon as there is no arrangement for accommodation at Hemkund.
