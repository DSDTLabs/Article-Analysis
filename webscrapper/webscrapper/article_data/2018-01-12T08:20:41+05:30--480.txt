MANGALURU: Most   barely draw a glance from passersby. But on Thursday, a sick dog at   got help 1,000km away, from   Maneka Gandhi. Responding to an SOS, the minister directed the animal husbandry department staff to find the dog and get it treated.

 The stray suffered from a disease that had led to open sores on its back. Unable to bear the pain, the dog was limping. On Wednesday, a devotee from north India who was visiting Dharmasthala clicked photos of the dog on a street. She sent them to an animal welfare group via Whatsapp and the message was forwarded to the Union miniter.
 
 Officials of the Dakshina Kannada animal husbandry department said the district administration received a message from Gandhi’s office on the dog’s plight. They alerted the animal husbandry staff and directed officials to take care of the dog. Animal husbandry department assistant director Rathnakara Mallya sent veterinarian Jayakeerthi Jain to Dharmasthala. First aid was administered to the dog and it was brought to Mangaluru in an ambulance.
