Noida: A day after a cab owner’s body was found in his own car outside Lotus Panache society in Sector 108, police said the victim and his driver, who is the main suspect in the murder, had talked to each other over phone multiple times. The police scanned the call details of cab owner Lokendra Singh and driver Ajay Sharma on Friday.

 Pankaj Rai, SHO, Surajpur police station, said the police conducted a search at Sharma’s house and found him missing. “The accused has fled along with his family members. We questioned his relatives and friends to know about his possible hideouts. We have assigned a team to arrest him,” he said.
