THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If everything goes as planned,   will become the first state in the country to set up a   (NERS) envisaged by the Union ministry after the   in Delhi. NERS is a unique and single helpline number that integrates all existing important emergency helpline numbers in one platform. 

 State police chief   here on Saturday said that the works on the system are going on in a steady pace and in all likelihood, it would come to existence in three or four months. People can access the service of the helpline by dialling 112. 
 
 "It is an integrated helpline number that can be dialled in any kind of emergency. The calls will be redirected to the departments concerned according to the nature of the emergency," Behera said. 
 
 Explaining the features of NERS, Behera said that at present, the state has many emergency helpline numbers such as 100 for police, 101 for fire and 102 for ambulance. The centres where calls are received too varies according to the location of the caller. For example, if a person dials 100 while within any city, the call would be received at the police control room functioning in the city. If the caller is located outside the city, the call will be redirected to the nearest police station. NERS changes all that. A person can dial 112 from anywhere in the state and the call would be received at its control room, from where the caller's complaint will be redirected promptly to departments concerned. 
 
 "We have also sought the government to allow funds to expand the fleet of   (CRV) so that we can respond to calls from rural areas more promptly," the DGP said, admitting the fact that they often find it difficult to provide quick response in rural areas. 
 
 NERS is a central government-funded project. It was announced following the Nirbhaya gang-rape case in Delhi in 2012. The proposed aim of the project was to avoid the trouble of remembering the numerous emergency helpline numbers.
