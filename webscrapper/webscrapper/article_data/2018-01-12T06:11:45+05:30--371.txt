KOLKATA: The detective department investigating the   murder case, where promoter   was shot dead on Monday morning, questioned four men who accompanied the main accused — Md   — to Bright Street.
 
 According to a source, one of the men called up someone after the incident to say kaam ho gaya (work is done). Thus, the investigators suspect another promoter, considered close to a top political leader in the area, might be involved and had used the property dispute between Rehman and Idris to his own advantage. “Rehman and Idris were neighbours. Why would Idris need to take men and vehiclesto visit his neighbour, unless he had other plans?,” the source told TOI.
 
 The CCTV footages of the area are being scanned. Cops also questioned two business associates of Rehman as they were present at thes pot.
 
  stoodby his neighbours in times of need, which led to his fall out with Idris and another promoter with criminal antecedents,  . “The fact that Idris came armed early in the morning shows it wasn’t a sudden decision but a planned murder,” said a source.
