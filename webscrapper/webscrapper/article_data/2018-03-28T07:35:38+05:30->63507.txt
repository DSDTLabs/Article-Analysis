PUNE: The state public works department ( ) will use the waste generated at various recycling points after the plastic ban in building asphalt roads.

 B Bawiskar, executive engineer, PWD (Pune division), said the department will use the plastic waste in road construction on pilot basis. “Based on a study by  , the roads built using plastic waste and tar will not just be cheap but also of superior quality than the prevailing asphalt roads,” he added.
 
 The   in its recommendations has stated that using plastic waste with tar to build roads improves the quality as well reduces soil pollution.
 
 “In the beginning, municipal corporations with a population of over 5 lakh and municipal councils with a population of over 2 lakh will be asked to include plastic waste for building roads in 50km radius,” a PWD official said.
 
 Studies have revealed that plastic waste have great potential for use in bituminous construction as its addition in small doses, about 5-10% by weight of bitumen, helps in substantially improving strength, fatigue life and other desirable properties of bituminous mix, leading to improved longevity and pavement performance.
 
 According to PWD officials, plastic waste in road construction ensures higher resistance to deformation, water-induced damages, increase durability and strength.
 
 When it comes to Pune, PMC is already tying up with firms like   Environment for setting up hot mix plant in   where plastic trash would be mixed with tar for a proposed 25km road. “The firm will collect the plastic waste from the city and process it at the plant to be eventually mixed with tar,” PMC officials said.
