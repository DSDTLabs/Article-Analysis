NAVI MUMBAI:   will have to face water cuts for 48 hours every week, starting April 11. To stretch supply from Ransai dam till monsoon, MIDC has decided to cut supply for two days instead of the existing one-day shutdown on Friday for weekly maintenance purposes.

 At present, the water level at Ransai dam is less than the corresponding level last year. So, citizens will have to brace for dry   on Tuesday and Friday, which means 20% to 25% water cuts are on the cards for   (UMC) areas besides 22 grampanchyats and industries. Residents have expressed resentment over the proposed additional cut on Tuesday.
 
 “We have already been suffering from weekly water cut on Friday under the guise of maintenance. To add to our woes, MIDC is going to implement cuts on Tuesdays too. Authorities should have a visionary plan to provide basic amenities like water and power before preparing the blueprint for rapid urbanization through mega projects like Navi Mumbai airport and Naina,” said local resident and activist, Santosh Pawar.
 
 MIDC will impose the 48-hour cut every week in two phases from April 11. The cuts will be in force till monsoon.
 
 “With far less rainfall in the catchment area last monsoon, the dam level has gone down drastically, indicating an all-time low that could only stretch the supply till May. With the fresh arrangement, looking at a late monsoon, supply will last till June-end with sizeable saving while the current storage is just 3.896 MCM,” said Ranjeet Biranje, deputy engineer, MIDC.
 
 He added, “Since Cidco has curtailed supply from actual demand of 10 MLD to 5 MLD, we haave been forced to impose further cut. Our dam level has also declined substantially, prompting us to implement cuts after delaying the process due to Ram Navami festival. Last year the water cut was implemented from March 15.”
