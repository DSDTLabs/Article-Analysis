MANALI: With National Green Tribunal ( ) stressing on setting up of passenger ropeway between Kothi village near Manali and Rohtang pass to reduce to number of tourist vehicles on this route but with residents of local panchayat not issuing NOC to the project developers, the government has called a public hearing on this issue on Monday.

 The NGT has repeatedly directed the state government to complete all formalities to set up the ropeway but the paper work is still incomplete. The residents from Kothi, Palchan, Solang, Ruar and many other villages through their panchayat have been opposing the ropeway. Some of the hoteliers and taxi operators are also opposing to the project. The   panchayat from where the ropeway is to be constructed has denied to issue NOC to the project. The NGT had summoned the panchayat representatives to appear before it last week and has ordered the state government to submit the report on the status of the ropeway project within one month.
 
 The public hearing is scheduled for Monday at Manali wherein officials from administration and tourism department would be present to discuss the issue with the villagers. Local commissioner from NGT is expected to join the hearing.
 
 Palchan panchayat pradhan Sunder Singh Thakur said, “I was informed that a public hearing is being organized in Manali and all of us are required to be present. I can not take any decision alone. We shall talk and let’s see what the results comes out.”
