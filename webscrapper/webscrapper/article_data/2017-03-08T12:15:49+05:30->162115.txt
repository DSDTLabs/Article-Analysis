It’s not   but  , who will host   8.
 
  Karan Tacker is set to host the ninth season of Nach Baliye. The deal was finalised over the weekend. Earlier, it was reported that Karan Singh Grover had been approached to come on board along with his actress-wife Bipasha Basu. But according to a source from the channel, there were plenty of creative differences with the duo so Karan Tacker will take the Star Plus’ dance reality show forward, even though he admits to have not seen a single episode earlier.
  
  “This is the first time I will see it that too live. The format is being altered slightly, it’ll be a little more straight-jacketed but fun,” informs Karan, who despite rumours of dating TV actress Krystle D’Souza insists he’s single and not qualified to be a participant on the couple’s dance show.
  
  
 
  
  The actor has been off daily soaps for a while after being last seen in Ek Hazaaron Mein Meri Behna Hai which ended in 2013. He confides that he misses performing and is waiting for something that will make him want to act again. Meanwhile, he thinks reality shows are fun as they don’t require too many hours of work and are done in 18-20 days and “Also, they don’t get monotonous.”
  
  He adds, “You can jump from one show to another once the season ends. Whereas in a series you’ve to stick to the same character graph for a couple of years. I’ve hosted The Voice before and had participated in Jhalak Dikhlaa Jaa. I was terrified of dancing and was pathetic at it. My schooling happened on the show and I went on to be one of the runners up. Now I love dancing, and I’m sure I’ll have a couple of performances on Nach Baliye too.”
  
  Buzz is, Karan Johar who was a judge of Jhalak Dikhlaa Jaa will be introducing Tacker in his upcoming campus caper, Student of the Year 2, which features Tiger Shroff in the lead and is being directed by Punit Malhotra. Karan abruptly turns wary, brushing off the question saying he will talk about it when the time is right.
