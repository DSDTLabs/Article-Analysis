AHMEDABAD:   police on Friday registered a complaint under IPC section 304A (causing death by  ) against three persons — the site engineer, the site supervisor, and the labour contractor of Cloud 9 project — for the death of three labourers on Thursday afternoon.

 The site near the Jhansi ki Rani statue had a major cave-in at about 3pm and a group of labourers were trapped after earth slid down from about 50 feet. Labourers from an adjoining site rushed to help and rescued eight persons. One labourer died on the spot. Those present at the site did not call the fire brigade.
 
 According to the complaint filed by S S Chaudhari, a sub-inspector with the Satellite police station, there was no retaining wall or overhanging protection as   mandate. The workers were not provided safety helmets or boots. Prima facie it appears to be a case of negligence leading to the deaths, the complaint says.
 
 The FIR says that Vijay Sahni, 25, Gurukumar Sahni, 18, and Pramodhanrai Yadav, 30 — all natives of Muzaffarpur, Bihar — died in the incident.
