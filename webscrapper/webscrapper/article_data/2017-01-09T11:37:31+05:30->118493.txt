RAJKOT: Congress leaders in Saurashtra staged protests against   leader   for his remarks against Congress national president   on Friday in Jasdan town of Rajkot.

 According to sources, Bhanderi, chairman of Municipal Finance Board and former mayor of Rajkot, had allegedly used abusive words for Sonia Gandhi during his speech after laying foundation stone for a road project in Jasdan town. He had also criticised Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. Congress leaders on Saturday organized protests in Rajkot, Porbandar and other towns of Saurashtra demanding unconditional apology from the BJP leader.
 
 In Rajkot, Congress staged protest at Trikon Baug and burnt an effigy of Bhanderi. Congress workers also rushed to state government’s Seva Setu programme venue and created ruckus there. They further ransacked deputy mayor Darshita Shah’s official car.
 
 “Using abusive words for Congress president Sonia Gandhi shows Bhanderi’s mentality. He has insulted a women,” said Congress leader Mansukh Kalaria.
 
 Congress workers in Porbandar also cornered Bhanderi and demanded his apology. Following the goof-up, BJP leader Nitin Bhardwaj said that Bhanderi has already tendered his apology over wrong choice of words. Bhardwaj accused Congress of playing it just for publicity.
