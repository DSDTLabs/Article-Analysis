HYDERABAD: A minor girl's boyfriend was arrested by   police on Saturday for helping his friend rape her. 

 Bowenpally police said car driver   was arrested, while his friend   was still at large. The victim was in a relationship with Raju for the last three months. About a month ago, Raju called the victim on the pretext of discussing their marriage plan and sexually abused the minor. 
 
 On May 15, Raju again contacted the victim to come to Dairy Farm Road in Bowenpally, but the minor rejected his request. The car driver, however, forced her to meet him. When the victim reached the location, instead of Raju, his friend   was at the location. When enquired about Raju, Kiran asked the minor to follow him. 
 
 "Kiran threatened her that he will reveal about the relationship between Raju and the victim. He also said he will defame her and her family in the locality. Fearing for her reputation, she went with Kiran to a nearby place, where he raped her. He later threatened her not to reveal the matter to anyone" Bowenpally police said. 
 
 Police said from the scene of offence, a leather purse was recovered in which the driving licence and a debit car belonging to Sai Kiran was recovered. A case was registered against the two under sections 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
