Panaji: The elderly, students and their parents were the most inconvenienced by the protest with many having to walk long distances to get to their destination. Some were forced to abandon their vehicles while others who were dependent on public transport were seen walking in the scorching heat to and from the Panaji bus stand as well as across the Mandovi bridge.  For those who decided to take the Panaji-Betim ferry, it was sadly the survival of the young and fittest. Motorists blocked the entire jetty and entrance to the jetty, leaving no space for people on foot to enter or exit the jetty. Commuters were left with no option, but to climb over the compound wall. Parents carried their little children over, while senior citizens with knee problems, including women in sarees, struggled to scale the wall. A pregnant lady refused to climb over the wall and had to wait for a considerable amount of time as she forced motorists to make way for her to exit the Panaji jetty. Some senior citizens driving cars, who got caught in the traffic jam at the Panaji jetty, decided to park their cars there and return later to pick them up.  “They have been flaunting their gold chains,” one senior citizen said, referring to those involved in the mining business, adding, “Now they’re creating hell for us,” he said.  At Bambolim, senior citizens, who visited Goa Medical College (GMC), waiting endlessly for public transportation in the blazing sun. A mother with her newborn was seen taking shelter from the afternoon sun in the shade of the GMC underpass. At the bus stand, a senior citizen couple who had walked a considerable distance were asking for directions and advice on transportation to reach a clinic in St Cruz.  They had to walk across the Ourem bridge to get transportation to reach St Cruz.  Many students and senior citizens were stranded at the bus stand and enroute to the bus stand.
