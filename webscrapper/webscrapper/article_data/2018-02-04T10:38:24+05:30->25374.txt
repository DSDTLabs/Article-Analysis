LUCKNOW: When he visits   on Holi, chief minister Yogi Adityanath might walk a distance of 500 metres to reach Rani Mahal—the place where gopis are believed to have played   with Lord Krishna.

 Though the distance is short, it would be difficult for the CM to walk, as the route-—Rangeeli Lane to Rani Mahal—is heavily crowded on the day.
 
 
 The CM had earlier said that he would visit Mathura to be part of the traditional Holi on February 24, the day Holi festivities begin in Barsana.
 
 Famous for ‘lath maar’ Holi, festivities begin a week before Holi festival in Mathura.
 
 According to legend, Lord Krishna had gone to Barsana to play Holi with Radha and other gopis. Retaliating, the gopis armed themselves with sticks to thwart Krishna and his friends’ efforts. The gopis then sprinkled colours on the group from Rani Mahal’s rooftop.
 
 This time, UP government is making efforts to make   a big event. The culture department is said to be investing money to make the event grand like   in Ayodhya.
 
 While replying to the opposition’s criticism on lavish Diwali celebrations in Ayodhya, Yogi had said that opposition would again criticise the government when he will go to Mathura to play Holi.
