NAVI MUMBAI: Over 300   on   land near   railway station were razed amidst protest in a   drive organised by Cidco and   on Wednesday. The protesters even set a few shanties on fire, which prompted the authorities to summon fire tenders. But no damage was reported as the fire was doused on time. 

 Slum dwellers alleged they were being cheated by the land mafia, who allowed them to construct chawls and shanties after taking money. A slum dweller, Shirish Gaikwad, said, “We had to shell out Rs 20,000 to the local goons, politicians and villagers. We had no idea that the land belongs to Cidco. There’s a nexus between land mafia and officials.”
 
 The team also demolished a 5-storey under-construction   building in sector 12, Khairane village, adjacent to the railway track. The developer constructed the building after demolishing an old health centre belonging to Cidco. P B Rajput, controller of unauthorized constructions, Cidco, said that the developer, Eba Patel, had been served with eviction notices under the MRTP Act but he paid no heed. “We have freed 300 sq m.”
 
 Over 100 cops were deployed with security staff from NMMC and Cidco to provide protection at both the places. The team faced stiff resistance from locals, which delayed it by couple of hours.
