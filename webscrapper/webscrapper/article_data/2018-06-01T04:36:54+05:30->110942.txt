NEW DELHI: Oil minister   burned the midnight oil on Thursday with his ministry officials and top honchos of oil companies in an effort to figure out a way to reduce  . The meeting discussed whether the government could ask ONGC to subsidise retailers by way of discount on crude or a windfall tax. However, it came to the conclusion that ONGC could not be expected to do so as it is likely to face major expenses in coming months. 

 
 Pump prices have risen to record levels in the fortnight since the Karnataka election, spurred by rising crude prices. This has shifted the focus on Centre raising taxes when the global oil prices were practically on a free fall. But since the government does not want to cut excise duty, it is looking at alternatives to reduce petrol and diesel prices that had on Tuesday touched an all-time high of Rs 78.43 per litre and Rs 69.31 a litre, respectively. Sources said the alternative in works is to ask ONGC give discount to fuel refiner-retailers.
 
 Oil producers ONGC and Oil India Ltd had till June 2015 made good as much as 40% of under-recoveries or subsidy arising out of selling fuel at below market price. The same subsidy sharing in some form is being brought back, they said. ONGC chairman Shashi Shanker, before the news of meeting came to light, said that the company hasnâ€™t heard anything from the government on subsidy sharing. Petrol and diesel prices have in the last two days have been cut by 8 paise and 6 paise a litre and the government is keen to show a visible reduction which can be possible only if retailers are subsidised.
