Rajkot:   

 Police identified the deceased as Jairaj Trivedi (18), a resident of Mehulnagar-2.
 
 According to police, the accident occurred at 11.30pm when Trivedi was driving his friend’s two-wheeler and his friend Jenish Virgama (19), a resident of Damjinagar near Pipaliya Hall, was riding pillion. 
 
 “After having breakfast at a roadside eatery, both friends started for home. While earlier Virgama had driven the two-wheeler, now Trivedi was riding it. When they reached Parshuram temple, a biker ahead of them slammed his brakes suddenly as his eyes were blinded by the lights of a speeding car coming from the opposite direction. Virgama, who was behind the bike, lost control and first hit the bike while overtaking it and came in the way of the car,” said an official from the University police station.
 
 “Such was the impact of the collision between the car and the bike that both Trivedi and Virgama were flung off the road. While Virgama miraculously escaped with minor injuries, Trivedi’s head banged against the road and he died on the spot,” added the official.
