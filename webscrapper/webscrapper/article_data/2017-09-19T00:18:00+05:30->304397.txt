Chandigarh: Eleven days after the students of Panjab University elected their council, there is still confusion over whether the newly elected members of the council would even take oath at a ceremony or not. The varsity is yet to announce a date for the event.

 While   dean for student welfare (DSW) Prof Emanual Nahar said they would not have any hesitation in holding an oath-taking ceremony for the new council if its members came to them with such a demand, newly-elected council secretary Vani Sood said they had been visiting the authorities every day, but they had not intimated them about the ceremony. “We don’t have any constitution that makes it mandatory for student council to take oath and then start working. We have completed all formalities and gotten signatures of office-bearers of the student council. We have not yet decided on the oath-taking ceremony. But, if students council members make such a demand, we will hold the ceremony,” said Nahar. 
 
 Sood said they were confused over the ceremony. “We assumed charge on September 11 and have been regularly coming to office since. We have started taking up students’ issues and have already started working with the central placement cell of the university,” Sood added. 
 
 A council member said they were yet to be given letterheads for official correspondences and that was one of the problems faced by them. “We are not able to give representations to the authorities because of this,” said the member. 
 
 Sood said the authorities were yet to apprise them of the date set for the event. The oath-taking of the department representatives (DRs) and executive council has already taken place, even though the elections for them were held nearly a week after the elections for members of the student council.
