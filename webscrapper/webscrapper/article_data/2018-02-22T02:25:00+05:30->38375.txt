Guntur: Notwithstanding the big scare over the proposed Financial Resolution and   Insurance (FRDI) bill among people which allows failing banks to use depositors’ money to cut losses, the mega Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam has forced people to rush to banks to withdraw their monies.

 If top banking sources are to be believed, depositors in Guntur district have withdrawn Rs 2,800 crore from the nationalised banks in the last three months. A top bank manager not willing to be named confirmed this. The severe cash crunch at ATMs is another factor keeping people away from depositing in the banks. Sources said that banks in the district have only Rs 25,000 crore in their accounts. “We are struggling to convince the customers who are trying to withdraw their FDs. We have not faced such a situation in the past,” Ch Moses, a branch manager at a nationalised bank, averred.
 
 K Raghuram, a former coordinator of State Bank of India (SBI) employees’ union, confirms the worst fears of depositors: “It is true that people have stopped depositing in the banks. Lack of cash at ATMs and fears on regulations about withdrawals are also to blame for the   in deposits,” he reasoned.
 
 Surprisingly, neither the banks nor the Reserve Bank of India have initiated measures to win the confidence of small depositors back. The nationalised banks in the district have 284 branches, which have granted loans of Rs 33,823 crore but have only Rs 27,800 crore in the form of fixed deposits (FDs). “I cannot leave my little savings to the looters of the banks,” shot back a retired employee Shaik Subhani, while withdrawing his Rs 3 lakh FD. Long queues are seen in the banks, who are trying to withdraw FDs.
 
 Although there is no direct link between FDs and advances, senior bankers expressed apprehensions that dwindling FDs could impact the health of the banks.
