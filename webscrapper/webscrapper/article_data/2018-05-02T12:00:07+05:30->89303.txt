HYDERABAD: Even as the TRS government is going full steam ahead on implementing the much-touted   scheme, 4.6 lakh   are yet to link their Aadhaar cards with government records to avail themselves of the benefit of 4,000 per acre. 

 More than 57 lakh passbooks will be distributed to farmers all over the state from May 10 when Rythu Bandhu is rolled out, but cheques will be given only to those who linked their Aadhaar cards with the records.
 
 Chief minister  , who held a review meeting with officials on Tuesday on the investment support scheme for farmers, said 4,114 crore had been kept ready in banks for disbursement. 
 
 Because of the severe heat conditions, cheques will be distributed from 7am to 11am and from 5pm to 7.30pm on May 10. The cheque distribution programme will be extended to a couple of more days if people are not able to collect them on the day they were supposed to receive them.
 
 The finance secretary would meet Reserve Bank of India officials to make arrangements for getting another 2,000 crore cash ready. A total of 6,000 crore cash reserves would be kept ready with the banks for distribution this season. The funds will be kept with State Bank of India, Telangana Grameena Bank, Grameena Vikas Bank, Canara Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Corporation Bank, Andhra Bank and Syndicate Bank. 
 
 In the first phase, financial assistance of 8,000 per acre per year for two crops will be distributed. 
 
 Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who held a review meeting on the investment support scheme for farmers, said 4,114 crore had been kept ready in banks for disbursement
