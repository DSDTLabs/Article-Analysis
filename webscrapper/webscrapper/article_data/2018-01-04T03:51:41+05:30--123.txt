NEW DELHI: Peeved at the dragging of its name in   caste violence, the   (RSS) on Wednesday hit back at its critics, saying the incident was the handiwork of “breaking India brigade”, which wants to divide the country on religious and caste lines. 

 “The ‘breaking India brigade’ had raised anti-national slogans at JNU in 2016 and is now trying to divide the Hindu society but Sangh will not allow it to succeed,” RSS spokesman   said at Ujjain on the first day of the saffron fountainhead’s coordination meet with BJP. Vaidya alleged that the “breaking India brigade-”chanted slogans at JNU in 2016 that India will be shattered into pieces. 
 
 “It wants to divide the country on religious and caste lines. It wants to divide the Hindu society. The Sangh castigates it,” he said. “The Sangh by uniting all sections of the society wants to march ahead,” he said when asked about   president Rahul Gandhi’s statement accusing RSS of being involved in the Maharashtra violence. 
 
 In his book ‘Breaking India’, Indian-American author Rajeev Malhotra has specifically written about this mentality stating that it is aimed at gaining political mileage, Vaidya said. “That is why this breaking India brigade is indulging in such acts. We won’t allow it to succeed. The RSS strongly condemns such mentality and opposes it,” he said. 
 
 Union minister Satyapal Singh defended the RSS against the allegations, saying, “The RSS is for establishing peace in the country and not to spread violence.”
