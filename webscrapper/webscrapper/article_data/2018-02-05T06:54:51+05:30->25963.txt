 “Northwesterly wind is still blowing into the city. But the moisture from the Bay of Bengal is not letting this cold and dry wind leave its impact. So, it has suddenly become warm,” said  , director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata. The mercury was likely to remain above the normal mark for the next few days, said the Met office, adding the maximum temperature could reach as high as 32°C by Tuesday.
