PUNE: Rabid   are not only a threat to the city’s dog population, but also to the health of its citizens. 

 The city, which had almost no reported cases of dogs inflicted with the fatal disease around 15 years ago, has seen a steady rise over the past few years, say animal rescuers.
 
 According to Neha   from animal rescue organisation, RESQ Charitable Trust, “The city was nearly rabies-free 15 years ago. About eight years ago, we used to receive two calls a year to report dogs that may be suffering from  . Three years ago, it rose to 1 call a month, and now we receive eight to ten calls a month”.
 
 She added that the biggest issue is illegal relocation of strays. “When dogs stay in a particular area, their health can be monitored and action taken if something is wrong. With these relocations, the problem worsens as animals suffering from the disease go undetected and may infect other dogs or even bite humans,” Panchami said.
 
 A dog’s rabies diagnosis can only be confirmed post its death by testing a brain sample. “There is currently no facility for this test in the city and kits available for this are expensive. Civic authorities need to ensure anti-rabies vaccinations are administered when they pick up dogs under the   programme,” she said.
 
 An official of the civic body’s health department said PMC does not have data on the total number of rabid dogs in the city due to the lack of such testing.
