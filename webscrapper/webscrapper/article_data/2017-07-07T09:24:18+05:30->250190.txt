NEW DELHI: A car   nearly managed to steal an armyman’s   in Delhi Cantonment after throwing chilli powder on the driver’s face, but he had to abandon his plan and flee after getting caught in traffic. 

 The entire incident was caught on camera.
 
 The incident was reported around 9.40pm on Wednesday. Lt Colonel Pinak Bani was contacted by one Jigar Patel after he put up an advertisement online for selling his old Maruti Zen.
 
 Patel met him near Delhi Cantonment after which Bani asked him to board his BMW to take him to see the Zen. He stopped midway at the mess to pick up some items and asked Patel to wait in his car with the driver.
 
 After a few minutes, Patel requested Bani’s driver to allow him to take the BMW for a spin. Patel drove a short distance and returned to the spot where the driver was waiting. However, instead of getting off, Patel threw chilli powder on the driver’s face and sped towards the gate.
 
 When the security personnel tried to stop him, Patel stepped on the gas and rammed through the gates. His plan to drive off with the vehicle was cut short due to traffic jam on SP Marg. The thief then got off the vehicle and ran away.
 
 Cops from   police station have recorded the statements of Bani and his driver. 
 
 “CCTV footage from the mess are being scanned to identify Patel. His online profile is also being scanned for clues,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Surender Kumar.
