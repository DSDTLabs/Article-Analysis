AMARAVATI: Sanjay Khodke, the Congress candidate for Amravati division Graduates’ Constituency polls who took objection to the nomination form submitted by state home minister   (BJP), is preparing to file a petition with the election commission challenging the affidavit. 

 Khodke claims that wrong details about his property have been submitted by Patil.
 
 “I had objected to Patil’s nomination before the returning officer but he has no jurisdiction to decide objections concerning affidavits. Now I will approach the election commission,” said Khodke.
 
 Divisional commissioner  , who is the returning officer, told TOI that he had received Khodke’s application but the matter has to be dealt by the election commission.
 
 Khodke alleged that Patil has provided incomplete, false and misguiding information about his property, education, profession and debts. He has also filed vague information regarding his own income, that of his wife’s and dependents. 
 
 Khodke claimed that Patil’s income of Rs 73.98 lakhs and that of his wife’s Rs 56,577 is false. The minister has also lowered the value of land that he owns.
