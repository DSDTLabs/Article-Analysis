JAIPUR: The   have renewed their demand for 5% separate quota within the 50% cap and once again given an ultimatum to the state government.  , who has been leading   since 2006, has given 10 days’ time to the government to meet the demand.

 A prayer meeting was held near Bayana in Bharatpur district on Tuesday for Gujjars killed in police firing during the quota agitation on May 23, 2008. Bainsla, while addressing his community men at the prayer meeting, announced about the 10-day ultimatum over the renewed demand.
 
 The Gujjar leader confirmed it to TOI on Wednesday. “Yes, we have asked for 5% separate quota for SBC (Special Backward Classes) within the 50% limit. State government should divide the 21% quota of OBC (Other Backward Classes) to meet our demand,” Bainsla said.
 
 He had made the same demand a couple of times earlier also but every time after negotiations with the state government agreed to have the   above the 50% limit and then contest its legitimacy in courts.
 
 Gujjars and four other communities included in the SBC category created through the reservation Act of 2015 were reverted to the OBC category last week, as the Rajasthan high court struck down the quota Act. This was the second time since 2009 when the 5% SBC quota was struck off by the high court since it shot up overall reservation in the state to 54%.
 
 “Successive state governments have been fooling Gujjars by giving SBC quota outside the 50% limit. The government brings in an Act and the court strikes it down. How long will it go on like this? This time the government should give our quota within the 50% limit or face statewide agitation,” said Himmat Singh, spokesperson of the Bainsla-led Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti.
