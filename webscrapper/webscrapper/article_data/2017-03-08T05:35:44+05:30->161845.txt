GURUGRAM: Here’s good news for taxpayers. MCG has decided that basements established as common facility in   and exclusively used for parking will be exempt from property tax.

 The notification of the Haryana government, dated October 2013, lays down the property tax chargeable from properties based on their classifications. In paragraph 2(A) under clause (a) sub-titled “Property Tax on Other Floors”, the notification states that basements that are used exclusively for parking are exempt from property tax.
 
 However, under clause (b) sub-titled “Flats” specifying applicable property tax rates per square feet based on carpet area of flat, there is no mention of whether basements exclusively used for parking would be assessed or exempt from property tax. Therefore, in the absence of any specific mention, some officials of the MCG have been assessing basements in residential group housing flats for property tax.
 
 “There has been some confusion prevailing in the minds of both officials as well as residents about this issue. Some complaints, too, have been received from residents. In order to bring in clarity, MCG commissioner V Umashankar, in keeping with the rules, has decided that basements established as a common facility in group housing residential flats and exclusively used for parking shall be exempt from property tax,” said an MCG official. Zonal taxation officers have been directed to immediately identify and review assessed properties in the nature of basements exclusively used for parking in residential group housing societies and exempt them from property tax.
