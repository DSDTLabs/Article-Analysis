NEW DELHI: India’s ambassadors around the world will put their heads together to focus on smarter and more effective diplomacy, weaving the government’s flagship programmes into their diplomatic arsenal. 

 The annual MEA talk-shop for its heads of missions, from May 4-7 here, is likely to also project greater diplomatic outreach in the regions that get less attention, like Africa and Latin America. PM Narendra Modi is expected to address the ambassadors while they will spend almost four days debating big thematic issues, including special sessions on China, connectivity, etc. 
 
 Meanwhile the MEA is once again getting used to the message from the Modi government that seniority is no longer the only criterion for plum postings. Vinay Kwatra, joint secretary in the PM’s office is set to take over as India’s ambassador to France in July. Ruchira Kamboj, currently India’s representative in Unesco, will go to South Africa as high commissioner. 
 
 India is sending a bunch of new people out as ambassadors — Gaitri Kumar, president Pranab Mukherjee’s social secretary, will be going as ambassador to Brussels, while Venu Rajamony, the very visible press secretary to the Rashtrapati will represent India at The Hague. Mukta Tomar has just taken over as ambassador to Germany, Manjeev Puri in Nepal and Taranjit Sandhu in Colombo. Pradeep Rawat, currently jont secretary, East Asia, will replace Nengcha Lhouvum in Indonesia. Santosh Jha, joint secretary policy planning, will take over as second-in-command in Washington DC, which is an ambassador-level post.
