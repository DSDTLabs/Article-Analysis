LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati said on Tuesday that President Pranab Mukherjee's address at the start of   in parliament reflected failure of the   government's policies. 

 Mayawati said the President's address is considered documentation of government policies that should raise hopes among people. "Instead, the speech was a repetition of old schemes which benefited only the rich," the former UP chief minister said. "Clubbing   and Rail budget and bringing them at the beginning of February is a part of BJP's drama," said Mayawati. She reiterated that decisions like demonetisation did not benefit people as projected by the BJP leaders.
