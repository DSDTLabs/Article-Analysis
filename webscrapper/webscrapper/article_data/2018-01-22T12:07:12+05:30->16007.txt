KOZHIKODE: In a severe jolt to the unification of the two Mujahid groups, a section from the former Markazudawa faction organized a meeting on Sunday in Kozhikode under the banner of the Ithihadu Subbanil Mujahideen (ISM), the youth wing of   (KNM). 

 Though there were provocative declarations at the conference, the presence of senior Mujahid leader and working president of the Kerala Jem-Iyyathul Ulema (KJU), the body of Salafi scholars, C P   was significant.
 
 Sullami inaugurated the conference in the presence of Mujahid leaders such as E P Ahamed Kutty, Abdul Latheef Karimpulakkal Ali Madani Morayur, ISM general secretary Jabir Amani and vice-president Abdul Salam Muttil. Historian K K N Kurup and social critic K E N Kunahammed also spoke at the programme organized to mark the golden jubilee of the ISM.
 
 The factions led by T P Abdulla Koya Madani and   merged in December, 2016, ending almost fourteen years of animosity. There were allegations at that time itself that the merger was effected without addressing differences on basic issues. One such issue was the effect of   (black magic or occult) that became of a bone of contention between the groups.
 
 A few months ago KNM brought out a circular on Sihr indirectly affirming that black magic can have influence humans, which was opposed by the Markazudawa group. The controversy led to the resignation of Abdul Latheef Karimpulakkal, who is now leading the dissident group. The dissidents feel that they were denied a decent accommodation at the Mujahid state conference held at Kooriyad in December 2106.
 
 "We will go ahead with the activities of the ISM though there are some restrictions imposed by the KNM," said a leader of the Markazudawa group.
