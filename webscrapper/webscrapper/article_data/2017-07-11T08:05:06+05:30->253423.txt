Actors Ajith, Vijay and Nayanthara have been seen smiling from ration smart cards stunning officials of the state civil supplies department verifying pile of applications.

 After the strange response, the department has begun organising special camps for a range of services including collection of photographs for smart cards. According to sources, a window was given to cardholders to upload a photograph of the family head if the one accessed from the National Population Register was not clear. But those who went online had different ideas it seems.
 
 “We were shocked to find the photographs of popular actors like Ajith, Vijay and Nayanthara in the attachments provided for   during verification. In a few cases, some have uploaded landscapes, photographs of deities and of outings with family members at picnic spots,” an official said.
 
 About 10% photographs received for family heads were inaccurate the official said, adding that most of the photographs were of actors. Sources said that one application was furnished with an obscene photograph. 
 
 Sources said the department chose to delete all applications with wrong photographs thereby delaying the timely delivery of smart cards to the public.
