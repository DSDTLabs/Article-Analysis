A producer and actor, Madhu Bangarappa is the sitting JD(S) MLA from Sorab. The family rift saw   take on Madhu and the other siblings. He defeated KJP’s Haratal Halappa in 2013. In the 2004 assembly elections, Kumar defeated Madhu by a margin of 12,000 votes. At that time, Madhu was the   candidate from Sorab.

 
 
 
 The fight is not between members of the Bangarappa family but between two individuals. Kumar has his own poll issues which he will talk about in his campaign and I have my five-year track record as MLA from the constituency. Despite losing elections previously, I didn’t run away from the constituency like some others.
 
 
 
 Everyone knows who followed the true principles of my father, S Bangarappa. Everyone knows who ruined my father and the family. Now, it’s shameful that Kumar has gone and joined the same party which he once called communal. People are shrewd and need not be told. There is already a lot of dismay among my father’s followers.
 
 
 
 The constituency saw Kumar earlier contesting from   and relegated him to third place. If BJP is under the false impression that the Bangarappa name alone will fetch them votes in this constituency, then it’s mistaken. My sister   and I have begun our campaign. It’s a no-contest.
