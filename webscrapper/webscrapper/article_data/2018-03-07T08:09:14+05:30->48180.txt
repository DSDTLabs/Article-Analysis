LUDHIANA:   will now face the music, as MC officials are going to serve sealing notices to them. Left with only a few days for the end of the financial year, civic officials are now left with the option of creating pressure on defaulters for  , and for that, they will serve sealing notices. Similarly, for defaulters of water supply and sewerage dues, the department will start disconnecting the lines, so that they clear their dues.

 Officials have been given set targets for every day. For   A, B, and C zones, they will have to recover Rs 2.5 crore each until March 31, while for Zone D, it is Rs 4 crore, because most commercial establishments fall in this zone. Apart from this, for water supply and sewerage, each zone has been asked to recover Rs 5 crore by the end of the month.
 
 A meeting was also conducted on Tuesday over this issue, where officials were asked to recover pending dues, without caring for political or any other kind of pressure, and there will be daily monitoring of their recovery drives. The sealing notices will be served by officials to defaulters, who will be given one week time to clear their dues, failing which MC can seal the establishment as well as auction it for recovery of their dues.
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said though they were ahead of the previous yearâ€™s recovery targets, even then, they wanted to achieve more. Therefore, the staff concerned were asked to expedite their recovery drives. He said they were expecting to recover around Rs 30-32 crore by the end of March, and defaulters not clearing their dues would land in trouble, as MC could seal and auction such properties.
