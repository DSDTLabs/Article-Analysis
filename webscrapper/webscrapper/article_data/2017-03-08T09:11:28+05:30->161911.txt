CHANDIGARH: Punjab Pardesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief   on Tuesday said that Prime Minister   had made a mockery of the plight of India’s debt-ridden farmers, dismissing his farmer loan waiver promise to Uttar Pradesh farmers as a “poll gimmick”.

 Questioning the timing of Modi’s promise of waiver of farm loans in UP if the BJP came to power in the state, Amarinder accused him of indulging in electoral politics at the cost of the lives of hundreds of farmers. Had the Modi-led central government been sincere in its concern over the plight of the farmers reeling under debt burdens, it would have by now waived these across the country, including Punjab, said the state Congress chief.
 
 “Modi could easily have announced farm loan waiver on behalf of the central government, as was done by   under the UPA regime,” Amarinder pointed out, recalling that the Congress had waived Rs 70,000 crore of farmers’ loans when it was in power. It was evident that the farm-debt waiver promise made by the Prime Minister during electioneering in UP and targeted at farmers of that state was nothing more than a ploy to garner votes for his party, the   chief ministerial candidate added.
 
 He reiterated his promise of waiving the loans of all farmers and agricultural labourers in Punjab, with or without the central government’s support, once the Congress came to power in the state. He pointed out that Modi even in his New Year eve address to the nation on December 31, 2016, had announced only partial relief for farmers, giving a 60-day interest waiver to those, who had taken loans from district cooperative banks. Why did the PM not announce a sweeping debt waiver for farmers across the country then, asked the the PPCC president.
