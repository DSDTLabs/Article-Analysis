KOLKATA:  's MPhil student Sushil Mandi called on vice-chancellor   on Wednesday, three days after he returned to the campus on February 27, to plead for a fair probe into the allegation against him.

 Mandi went missing from JU campus on February 2, after a film studies department student accused him online of sexually assaulting her. Besides, he also wants the cells addressing complaints of sexual harassment and minority issues on campus to be strengthened.
 
 “I am happy he has returned,“ V-C Das told TOI. After a teary reunion with his brother Haradhan, Mandi spoke about how he got involved in Singur and Nandigram protests after securing admission to JU's engineering faculty. “I had voiced my protest against gender abuse, patriarchy and casteism. Yet, I found myself in the centre of a molestation controversy, where I was being tried on social media without any formal complaint being lodged,“ he said. Torn between his political past of supporting abused women and his current status of being shamed as a molester, Mandi claimed to have run away to his friend's house in Belda. “But three weeks later, I called up my friend Jubi (Saha) and returned to JU because I wanted to reveal the truth,“ Mandi said. Saha insisted she wouldn't support anyone guilty of sexual harassment: “If Sushil is guilty, he should be punished. But I was present there and I know Sushil wasn't in the wrong.“
 
 Asked why he didn't return when his friends were searching for him, including at morgues, Mandi claimed he wasn't aware his absence had created such a hue and cry. Saha said she had even called up the person Mandi was staying with in Belda.“But as Sushil had asked him not to, the friend did not tell us he was with him. His friend feared disclosing his location might drive him away from his home. Police are questioning the friend,“ Saha said.
 
 About the FIR against five students following a complaint by Mandi's brother, Saha said, “We are seeking a legal advice.“
