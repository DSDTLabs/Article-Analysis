AHMEDABAD: A man escaped a would-be fatal   by a whisker on Saturday morning, when the car he was driving rammed into a bus in front of him, leaving him with injuries caused by the broken windscreen.

  police said Kishan Suthar, 30, a resident of Khoraj,  , is a driver for Bopal-based Rao Tourist for past three years. He ferries employees of a Sanand-based company to Ahmedabad and vice versa. According to his statement, he had dropped off the employees from the morning and was returning to Ahmedabad with the night-shift employees.
 
 “When he was near Antariksh Colony on   road at 8.15am, he slowed down because there was a speed breaker ahead. The bus was then hit by a car from behind. Suthar and others got down and found that the car had squeezed under the bus up to the steering wheel,” said an investigator.
 
 The car driver, identified as Dinesh, 28, suffered cuts due to the broken windshield. He was shifted to the ICU at a private hospital by an EMRI 108 ambulance. Investigators said that it likely that the car was in speed and the driver misjudged the speed of the bus when it slowed down, thus colliding with it.
