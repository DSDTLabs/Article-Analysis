NEW DELHI: An 
  in   last Wednesday had only minor injuries and was not admitted to any hospital's intensive care unit (ICU), contrary to Indian media reports.

  India's ambassador to Poland made this clarification in a Facebook post.
 
 "He was discharged after first aid and feels fine now. (Some sections of the Indian media have incorrectly reported that he is in the ICU.)," wrote  , the ambassador. The student now wants his privacy, Bisaria added.
 
 Several media reports said the Indian students was "badly beaten up", "managed to survive" and was "admitted to the ICU." A man who claimed to be the student's friend also told TOI the incident was racial like the shooting murder of   in Kansas in the US.
 
  It appears none of this is accurate.
 
 
 
 
 
 The ambassador further wrote that the Indian student was "punched on the face for no reason by an unknown assailant, a male in his 20s, who shouted at him, apparently in Polish", after which he ran away from the scene. The motive of the attack is also unclear, he said.
 
  
  
 
 "The police have CCTV footage and two eye-witness accounts; they are hopeful of hunting down the culprit. We are monitoring this case closely," Bisaria wrote.
