TRICHY: V Divaharan, brother of jailed AIADMK leader  , has claimed that his statement on former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death has been misinterpreted. He had claimed earlier on Wednesday that the late leader actually died on December 4, 2016, and that the hospital had taken a day more to declare it.

 Divaharan gave the clarification at a hurriedly called news meet at his house in Suntharakottai in   district after his statement evoked much criticism. “There are two types of death, clinical and biological. Jayalalithaa suffered clinical death on December 4, 2016. Subsequently, the Apollo doctors tried their best to revive her with the help of ventilator. However, on the evening of December 5, she suffered biological death. I came to know of all these only from the doctors of Apollo hospital. When I said Apollo doctors, it was misunderstood as its chief Prathap Reddy”, he elaborated.
 
 He said that neurologists from   Memorial Government hospital had arrived in Apollo and certified her death. Only after their certification did Apollo Hospital formally declare that she had passed away. “Some people have tried to take advantage of the situation. My statement was only aimed at exposing such people”, he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, fisheries minister   has said that Divaharan should be arrested for his controversial statements about the death of the former chief minister even as an inquiry commission was going into the circumstances leading to her death.
