Gurgaon: Traffic diversions that were put in place on Delhi-Gurgaon   on Monday did not even last a day — soon after the morning rush hour, traffic snarls choked both sides of Rajiv Chowk junction. Vehicles barely moved and tailbacks were seen till   and Hero Honda Chowk on either side of the carriageway. 

 The diversions have thus been scrapped and an alternative route is being devised around Rajiv Chowk, Signature Tower Chowk and   where underpass construction is going on. 
 
 Traffic police, officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the contractor for the underpass held a meeting on Tuesday wherein it was decided to conduct a fresh inspection of the area on Wednesday to devise a more feasible route for commuters. 
 
 Construction of the three underpasses at Rajiv Chowk, Signature Tower and Iffco Chowk began three months back. Since then, around 20% of the work has been completed and it now needs to be expanded. To facilitate this, traffic diversions were imposed on Rajiv Chowk from Monday wherein vehicles coming from the Jaipur side were diverted left towards  , only to return to the junction after taking a U-turn.
 
 But things did not go as planned. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded on the road, and to worsen the situation, a truck broke down near Rajiv Chowk on Jaipur-Delhi side around 10am. It took commuters over an hour just to reach Mini Secretariat from the junction. It was only after three in the afternoon that the congestion was cleared. 
 
 “The   plan turned out to be disastrous; it did not survive the Gurgaon traffic even for a few hours. We will inspect the area again on Wednesday, and by next week, we will have a new, better diversion plan in place,” said DCP (traffic) Balbir Singh.
