DEHRADUN: A group of five disabled people will undertake   on Tuesday, trekking from Gaurikund to Kedarnath as part of the   2017 mission.
 
  Chief minister   on Monday gave a send-off to the group in Dehradun.
  
  Group members, who walk on artificial limbs, say they are excited to undertake the pilgrimage, for which they will be trekking a distance of about 21 km between Gaurikund to Kedarnath and vice versa.
  
  The members will offer prayers at Kedarnath on May 3, the day when portal of the holy shrine opens.
  
  One of the participants said, “By undertaking this trip, we want to tell the world that a mission is accomplished by mental toughness more than anything else.”
  
  The trekking is being organised by Nautiyal Artificial Limbs Centres (NALC), Dehradun, which has been proactively conducting trekking for the past three years. NALC director Vijay Nautiyal said, “Due to lack of motivation and guidance disabled people are generally left out. Our aim is to provide all possible aids to these mentally fit people for whom physical barrier is not an issue.”
  
  The group will return to Dehradun on May 4 after covering 42 km.
  
  A total of 14 people have left for the mission, including NALC director, who has taken different groups of disabled to   and Kedarnath on several occasions in the past.
  
  The flag off ceremony was attended by Ajay Bhatt, Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi and several other dignitaries.
