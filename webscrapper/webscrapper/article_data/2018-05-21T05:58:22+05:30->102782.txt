CHANDRAPUR: Speeding vehicles knocked dead a sloth   and spotted deer in separate accidents on Chandrapur-Brahmapuri road under   and   ranges on Sunday morning. This road has been recently declared as national highway and its widening and strengthening work is underway through forest patches without undertaking any mitigation measures.

 A sub-adult female sloth bear was knocked dead by an unidentified vehicle under compartment No. 356 in Mahadwadi beat during the early hours of Sunday. The bear had sustained injuries on its head and had died after walking a few feet aside the road. Special Tiger Protection Force personnel found the carcass while patrolling and informed the local officers, who in turn shifted the body to   transit treatment centre for postmortem.
 
 In yet another incident on the same road ahead, an unidentified speeding vehicle knocked dead a spotted deer on Mul-Sindewahi stretch passing through forest compartment No. 317 of Saoli range. Officials claimed that the male deer had collapsed around 20 feet away after being hit by the vehicle head-on. This is third such hit-and-run case on the same road in Saoli range in four months. Earlier this month, a leopard was killed under a speeding vehicle in Lohara forest.
 
 The speed of vehicles on the road has increased after the National Highway Authority of India started road widening work a few months ago. Despite objection and protest by wildlife activists to avoid road widening and cutting of trees in the eco-sensitive zone of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, the road widening work has continued unabated. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre emphasized the need for taking up mitigation measures while widening and strengthening of the road. “Speed of vehicles on newly widened road has increased, taking its toll on the wildlife,” he said.
