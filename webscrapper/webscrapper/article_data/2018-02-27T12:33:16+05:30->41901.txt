Trichy: Members of   and   met the district collector during the grievance day here on Monday and urged him to take steps to allot houses in slum clearance board since nobody is ready to rent them houses.

 Though the government has been extending various welfare measures to the community, both governmentâ€™s free house site and allocation of solar powered green houses have not been extended for them, they stated in the petition submitted to district collector  .
 
 Since there were lots of practical difficulties cited by the government for allocating free house site for transgender, they urged the government to do the needful to get home from the quarters which were being built under slum clearance board. They also added that senior citizens were not getting old age pension for past one year.
 
 More than 500 transgender people reside in Trichy. However, only 50 have so far been provided with   under   provided in association with union government project, they said.
 
 Since a considerable number of transgenders are having the educational qualification, the district administration should conduct job fair exclusively for them and help them to get employment opportunity both in government as well as private organisations, they demanded.
 
 Meanwhile, district collector K Rajamani asked them to behave in a way that would bring them respect in the society. He also assured them of getting maximum welfare measures for the upliftment of their community, P  , president of the association said.
