NEW DELHI: Apart from tackling law and order, the   government in   has a tough challenge ahead as the country’s most populous state has slipped on most social and economic parameters due to decades of unstable governments and rule by regional outfits.

 Realising that UP must develop for India to progress, the   government has asked the   to assist the state in charting out a road map for transformation. 
 
 Be it the number of poor, health indicators, higher school dropouts or houses without electricity, UP lags way behind other states.
 
 According to a presentation made by Niti Aayog CEO   before Adityanath, the state has 22 districts out of 100 across the country where the ratio of below poverty line individuals to the total population is high.
 
 The situation of education in UP is equally grim. Out of 100 districts across the country with poor school dropout rate, 21 are in the state. 
 
 In terms of learning outcomes, UP is among the poorest performers. Only 46.7% of students of Class V in the state can at least subtract. The heath scenario too is bleak.
 
 On children under 5 who are stunted, 29 of the 100 worst-performing districts are in UP.
 
 A six-member joint working group, with three representatives each from Niti Aayog and the state government, will suggest an implementable action plan to boost economic growth.
 
 Sources said BJP’s top leadership, including PM Modi, wants the state to make noticeable improvements on the infrastructure front and social indicators before the 2019   polls.
