CHENNAI: The right of an accused to be released on bail at the end of a 90-day remand period is not absolute, the Madras   said on Thursday. Such a ‘limited or restricted right’ could be invoked only after the prosecution’s petition to extend the remand to 180 days is decided by the competent court, it added.

 Justice R Suresh Kumar gave the clarification on a petition filed by Muhamed Sahibullah and Sadhik, both accused in the 2014 murder case of Hindu Munnani leader K P S Suresh Kumar, assailing the order of the special court for bomb blast cases, principal sessions court, Tiruvallur.
 
 Advocate M Radhakrishnan, representing the petitioners, said that as per provisions of the CrPC, if the prosecution failed to file chargesheet within 90 days of arrest, the accused should have the right to release under statutory bail. In the case of the petitioners, the 90-day period expired. But their remand was extended to 180 days and therefore the trial court should have allowed their plea seeking  , he argued.
 
 Dismissing this, Justice Suresh Kumar said: “It seems, even if the initial statutory period of 90 days is expired and until a petition to seek extension of remand is pending, and in the meantime if a plea seeking statutory bail is filed, the same shall be considered only after disposal of the extension petition. In other words, only when extension petition is rejected or not filed, the accused shall be entitled to seek statutory bail.”
