The event organisers expect a participation of 10,000 delegates from different academic and social fields. 
 
 Expressing pain and anguish over growing atrocities on dalits and adivasis on non-issues, the bid to grab the tribal people's land by the corporate organisations and capitalists against their wishes besides a spurt in the incidents relating to attacks on Muslims in the recent years, the SIO functionary said education alone is the tool to empower the vast population of the dalits and adivasis and Muslim youths. 
 
 "Nearly 80 percent of the government school students are dalits, muslims and adivasis. Ironically, at these government schools, the level of education is abysmally poor," claimed Ansari. "The best way to improve the education of the government primary schools is to upgrade them on the lines of Kendriya Vidyalaya," said Ansari.
