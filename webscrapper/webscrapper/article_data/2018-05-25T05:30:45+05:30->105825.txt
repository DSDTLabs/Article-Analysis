DEHRADUN: The   government has invited bloggers from across the country to hop on a ‘bloggers bus’ to four Char   destinations. The bus, which aims to promote the yatra through blogs, was flagged off on Thursday from Rishikesh with eight passengers. The bloggers will cover the three-day Tehri lake festival which starts on Friday.
 
  Earlier this month, the first such bus was flagged off from Rishikesh on May 16. From May 16 to May 20, seven bloggers went to Ganogtri and   shrines.
  
  Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “There are several picturesque locations in Uttarakhand. We need to serve this message to as many people as possible. Tehri lake festival holds immense potential and opportunity for the state.”
