PATNA: Two days before the formation of a massive human chain in Bihar on January 21 against alcoholism, the   on Wednesday asked the state government which law empowered it to disallow vehicular movement on national and state highways and involve schoolchildren in the event.

 Hearing a PIL filed by  , a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice   directed the government to submit its reply on Thursday when the case would be heard again.
 
 Seeking to know under which law has the government restricted vehicular movement on the highways and planned to involve schoolchildren in the human chain formation, petitioners’ counsel   and Syed Azhar Nezami also questioned whether or not involvement of children in the human chain event would amount to violation of human rights.
 
 The PIL referred to the state chief secretary’s order on Monday banning vehicular movement on the highways between 10.15am and 3pm on the day, and pleaded to the court to quash the order as it violated people’s rights to move on roads.
 
 Principal additional advocate general Lalit Kishor assured the court on behalf of the State that emergency services like ambulance would be exempted from the restriction. However, the court wondered if it would not be a case of discrimination against other services and vehicles.
 
 That emergency vehicles will be allowed to ply, suggests there will be room for vehicular movement during the event, the court observed.
 
 The proposed human chain is likely to be spread over a length of 11,285km, including 3,007km on the main route, which will not break anywhere. The length of the chain on sub-routes will be around 8,000km. CM   will also participate in the chain to be formed for 45 minutes from 12.15pm to 1pm.
