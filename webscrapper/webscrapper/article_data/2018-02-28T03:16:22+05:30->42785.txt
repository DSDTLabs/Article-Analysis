KOHIMA/DIMAPUR/SHILLONG: Voters turned out in huge numbers in the highstakes election to the Nagaland and Meghalaya assemblies on Tuesday. Voting was largely peaceful, barring a gunfight near a polling station in Nagaland in which one person was killed. Till 4 pm, Nagaland registered a turnout of 75% and Meghalaya 67%. In 2013, Nagaland and Meghalaya had recorded 91% and 89% polling respectively. Reports are yet to come in from the remote areas. 

 The votes will be counted on February 3. 
 
 Both Nagaland and Meghalaya have 60-member assemblies. In Nagaland, the fight for power is between ruling NPF and National Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP)-BJP alliance. This time, the election was held only in 59 seats because one of the constituencies, Northern Angami-II, has already been won by NDPP chief   unopposed. Last month, Rio, a former CM, had broken away from NPF and formed NDPP. Despite its alliance with NDPP, BJP is still an ally of NPF in the government. 
 
 In Meghalaya, too, voting took place in 59 seats as election to the Williamnagar seat has been countermanded following the killing of NCP candidate Jonathone Sangma by suspected   militants 10 days ago. The ruling Congress is fighting, among other parties, Nationalist Peopleâ€™s Party (NPP) and BJP. Though they are fighting the assembly elections separately, both NPP and BJP are allies at the Centre.
