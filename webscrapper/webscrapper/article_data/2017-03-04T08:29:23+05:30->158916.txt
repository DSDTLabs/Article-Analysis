VISAKHAPATNAM: The   MLC elections has turned into a political battle with the YSRCP on Friday extending support to   (PDF) candidate Avadhanula Aja Sharma. Now, the elections has become a straight fight between the PDF candidate and TDP supported   candidate PVN Madhav.

 Apart from these two, Congress candidate Yadla Adiraju and independent nominees VV Ramana Murthy and Chandra Sekhar are also in teh fray and can play spoilsport to the two main candidates. 
 
  The constituency has almost 1.57 lakh voters of which almost 90,000 votes are in   district and 61,000 in the seven assembly constituencies in city alone. Majority of the voters are employees and youth. “I will fight for the youth and employees benefits apart from striving for the aspirations of the   people. I will focus on the railway zone issue and seek more funds for the development of the backward area of North Andhra,” the TDP supported BJP candidate Madhav said. 
 
 On his part, PDF candidate Sarma said North Andhra has been neglected by successive centre and state governments and that he would continue to raise his voice to highlight the issues of the region in the council and elswhere.
 
 The MLC elections are to be held on March 9 and the results slated to be declared on March 18.
