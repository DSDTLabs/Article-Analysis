 BALANGIR: A case was filed recently against the sarpanch of   gram panchayat in   block of Balangir district for allegedly abusing and threatening village resource persons (VRP) of a social audit team while they were presenting a report before the gram sabha. 
 
 A source said the incident started from a small argument and escalated to a heated discussion in the presence of villagers. The sarpanch then reportedly used abusive language against the women of the team.
 
 However Ananta Kishor Sahu, the sarpanch denied all charges framed against him. "The audit team has been demanding a bribe at every social audit," Sahu said.
 
 The audit team was assigned the social audit of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Act ( ) by the district administration. In a block level, the VRP audit villages twice in a year and present their report before the gram sabha.
 
 Barsha Harpal, district social auditor said this is a case of harassment. "This incident raises concerns on the safety of women social auditors who work in remote villages to maintain transparency in MGNREGA in the district," said Harpal.
 
 This is the second such incident where a VRP was threatened while carrying out an audit on MGNREGA. Earlier on December 7, a relative of the sarpanch of Sihini gram panchayat abused and drove out a women's audit team while they were on duty.
 
 "I have received a complaint on the incident and initiated an inquiry," said Mohan Sahu, block development officer of Titilagarh block.
