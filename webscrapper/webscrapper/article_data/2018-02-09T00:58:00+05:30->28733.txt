Trichy: BJP state president Tamilisai Soundarrajan has said that she is worried at the law and order situation in the state in the light of gangsters celebrating a don’s birthday by cutting the cake with a machete and creating public nuisance in Chennai on Wednesday. 

 “I don’t know whether to appreciate the police for arresting the gangsters or to criticise the state government for letting them out,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a state-level consultative meeting of the party in Trichy. 
 
 “Tamil Nadu has shot into international limelight with rowdies cutting cake with a machete. The chief minister should pay attention to the worrisome law and order situation in the state with utmost priority,” Tamilisai added. 
 
 On the national eligibility-cum-entrance test to select MBBS aspirants, she said, “The entire people in the state have accepted NEET as important for medical aspirants. Tamil Nadu government too has been making arrangements to conduct special coaching classes for the benefit of the aspirants. 
 
 But the communists and Congress have been showing double standards. The communists in Kerala and Congress in Karnataka had already accepted NEET. However, in Tamil Nadu, both the parties oppose NEET”, she said. 
 
 She assured that all discrepancies would be removed before the examination was conducted.
