PATNA: The   will start functioning as a centre for haemophilia (an inherited bleeding disorder) from this financial year.

 State health department recently issued a directive to the   and Hospital ( ) and New Gardiner Road Hospital to create two posts each for haematologists in the hospitals. The letter said the New Gardiner Road Hospital would be developed into a haemophilia centre. 
 
 New Gardiner Road Hospital superintendent Dr   said on Thursday three departments, including the endocrine department, department of nephrology and a specialized department for haemophilia, were needed to be developed to develop the hospital into a superspecialty centre for haemophilia,
 
 “The endocrine and nephrology departments are almost developed. We have one doctor each in both the departments as well as necessary equipment and drugs. The process to depute one more doctor each in the departments is underway. As of now, we need Elisa reader which we are hopeful to get soon,” Dr Sinha said.
 
 The Elisa reader is used to conducts tests for immune responses of the body attacked by viruses, bacteria and allergens.
 
 According to Dr Sinha, the haemophilia department has two sanctioned posts of haematologists against which one doctor is working on deputation.
 
 “As of now, we require drugs for the treatment of Factor VIII and IX (protein and protease respectively, responsible for blood coagulation). We have two options before us. Either we wait for the Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructures Corporation Ltd (BMSICL) to supply the drugs to us or we conduct local immediate purchase. As the drugs need to be bought on a large scale, the BMSICL option seems more feasible,” Dr Sinha said.
 
 On the other hand, PMCH principal Dr Vijay Kumar Gupta said for now two haematologists would be appointed in the department of pathology as there is no specialised department for haemophilia at PMCH.
