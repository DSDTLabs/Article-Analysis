KOLHAPUR: The civic body has decided to pay Rs 1 crore to the   (WRD) that has threatened to snap   to the city if the lifting charges are not paid.

 The WRD is a state government body that manages water use from natural resources. Last week, the department wrote to the   to pay dues of over Rs 10 crore. It charges Rs 4.2 per 10,000 litres lifted from the Panchganga.
 
 Suresh Kulkarni, KMC’s chief hydraulic engineer, said, “We have drafted a proposal to pay Rs 1 crore to the department, which is now with the accounts department. The department has agreed not to initiate any action. We are discussing with WRD officials regarding our claims on rates at which they are charging fees from the KMC. The payments will be made next week.”
 
 The civic body lifts water from several sources for instance from the Bhogavati river and Panchganga river. The WRD charges the civic body and other local governing bodies for using water from these sources.
 
 After lifting water from the Panchganga at   and  , the KMC supplies water to treatment plants after which it is supplied to households. The civic body on an average lifts 120 million litres of water each day.
 
 The KMC claimed that since they constructed a barrage at Shingnapur on its own, the rate should be just 70 paise per 10,000 litres as per guidelines. But, the department claimed that they have to release water from dams as the barrage does not get filled adequately.
 
 “We have requested department authorities not to charge exorbitantly during monsoon as the water is not released from dams. We have also asked them to charge according to the use and not the quota. As per the use, the KMC will save around 30% in the fees,” Kulkarni said.
