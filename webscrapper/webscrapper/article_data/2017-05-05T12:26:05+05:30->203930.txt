PUNE: The state Inspector General of Registration and   department ( ) has proposed linking of data from the registration department to the police department which will exempt citizens from the mandatory   to encourage more online registrations for leave and licence agreements.

 The move will keep out middlemen like lawyers and real estate brokers from the system. The e-registration system was launched in 2014 and has picked up in many cities in the state. The department has written to the police a month ago. 
 
 “If the police department exempts citizens from giving information for the document registered with us, they will be encouraged to go for online registration. We have over 300 authorised service providers who have to be paid a fixed sum. They can come home and register the documents for leave and licence agreements,’’ the IGR official said.
 
  
  
 
 When the police headquarters in Mumbai was contacted, senior officials said they would have to look into the proposal in detail.
 
 Officials said the process can be done from home if the service providers have a web camera and a thumb scanner and net facility to access the registration department’s website or call any of the empanelled service provider who would have to be paid Rs 300 for helping or be called home with the equipment for Rs 1,000. 
 
 “These services have been provided if the police verification is done simultaneously as the person has to provide the Aadhaar number and PAN number as part of verification. We could provide the data to police which would clear the verification process,’’ the official said.
 
 Sheela Krishnan, a resident of Kondhwa area, said when she leased out her apartment a year ago she had to pay Rs 8,000 to her lawyer. Today, she is aware of the online registration process and has called a service provider home for Rs 2,000. 
 
 Mohan Das, who is new to the city, said he had to pay his broker a hefty amount to ready the entire documents with the police verification.
