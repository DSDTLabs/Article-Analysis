KOCHI: The   requires   (KSEB) support in developing a temporary parking lot at the busy Palarivattom Junction. 

 The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd ( ) needs 0.7 acres owned by the electricity board on lease for a period of one year.
 
 The Metro agency is of the view that a temporary facility would be required till the proposed multi-level parking on KMRL’s premises get ready at Palarivattom. 
 
 “There is an immediate requirement for parking space. Hence we approached the KSEB,” said KMRL spokesperson. 
 
 Though KSEB officials confirmed that the Metro agency has submitted a formal request seeking land at the busy junction, they did not confirm whether a decision has been taken in this regard. 
 
 “The electricity board has initiated discussions in this regard. However, it would be difficult for the KSEB to part with the land,” said a senior KSEB engineer in Ernakulam.
 
 When Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) expressed its willingness to begin commercial operations from Aluva to Palarivattom in April, the city police cautioned about the possible traffic congestion in the city. If metro is thrown open without providing basic infrastructure facilities it would lead to traffic blocks. As many people would come down from various parts of the city or state to take a Metro ride, and there is a possibility of vehicles getting parked on the sides of the road resulting in congestion and slow movement of traffic.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (law &order and traffic) G H Yatish Chandra had said that it was the responsibility of Kochi corporation and Metro agencies to provide sufficient parking facilities.
 
 Even though the local body is bound to come up with measures to ensure sufficient parking, they do not have any concrete plans.
