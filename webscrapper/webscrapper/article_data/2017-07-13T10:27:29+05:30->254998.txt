NAGPUR: “In our society, a woman always has to face a lot of challenges and struggle but it is good to see that ladies in the city are coming out of their homes and working”, said Mayor   on Wednesday. 

 Jichkar was speaking at the inaugural meet of All Ladies League (ALL), Nagpur chapter as the chief guest at Chitnavis Center, Civil Lines. 
 
 ALL Ladies League (ALL) is the world’s largest All-inclusive international women’s chamber and a global movement for the Welfare of ALL by empowering women’s leadership.
 
 Holding a discussion with around 50 women entrepreneurs at the event, Jichkar who is a multiple degree holder, shared the struggling phase of her life. “I was the kind of girl who would never go out of her home after 6pm, and now I am managing the whole city. Society expects a lot from us and definitely it is our duty to serve our family and children, but somehow this will affect our professional life too. And between all these things, you need to figure out your skills and passion and work towards your dream”, she added.
 
 At the same programme, chartered accountant Riddhi Saboo, chairman of ALL, Nagpur chapter and CA Kirti Agrawal spoke on ‘Understand GST in much better way’.
 
 The city’s first lady also said how it is the quality of multitasking which makes women different from men. ”We as woman always have the habit of listening to everyone who gives us advice, but I think to achieve something big in life you should follow your heart and ignore everything else.”
 
 “When you don’t like anyone’s opinion, don’t blame it on anyone and lose your focus, work hard towards your own journey,” she added. 
 
 Anisha Singh, who heads a herbal cosmetic product business, Ela Shrma, who works in media production,  , who works in art and craft, Richa Agarwal, who owns a bakery and Simran Khandelwal, chartered accountant by profession were among the women who had come for the occasion.
