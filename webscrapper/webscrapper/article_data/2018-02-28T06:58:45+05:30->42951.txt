KOLKATA : Breaking its  ,   has decided to   to sustain its   and reinvent itself.

 The garden was established in 1878 and till now, did not charge entry fee. However, due to lack of funds and the need to make it attractive, the silviculture (Hills) division (research wing) of the forest directorate, that maintains the garden, has decided to charge visitors.
 
 “We will be introducing ticket system from mid-March and visitors will be charged entry fee. It is a nominal amount but is required. We do get fund from the state government but it’s not enough to improve and maintain the garden,” said Manoj Kumar Chhetri, the range officer. Visitors will henceforth be charged Rs 20 per head. Students will be charged Rs 5 if they come in uniforms or provide identity cards.
