Bhubaneswar: To revamp public transport in the city under its smart city projects, the   (BDA), the   and   (BMC) will invite expert opinion in a workshop to be conducted on Thursday. 

 Smart Mobility Solutions is one of the components of the smart city which will pave way for improving public transport. Earlier, the BDA had signed an MoU with   (WRI), a global non-government organization working for sustainable urban mobility, for technical assistance in its mobility plan.
 
 Columbian  , who is from WRI and one of the experts, will deliberate on how to make the city's transport a smart one. There will be citizen's groups besides various government agencies taking part in the discussion. 
 
 "This will be the first discussion on the city's smart mobility plan since signing of the MoU with the WRI. This will help identify the grey areas," a BDA spokesperson said.
 
 Official sources said the WRI will coordinate with the stakeholders such as the transport department, the Bhubaneswar-Puri Transport Services Limited (BPTSL), BMC, the works department and other agencies to help BDA implement the project. 
 
 "There will be total overhauling of the city's public mobility. There will be dedicated bicycle paths and wide and planned roads to reduce accidents," said a BDA official.
 
 Based on the solutions to come out from the discussions in the workshop, the WRI will conduct a survey to identify the routes for implementing the new transport plan, which include dedicated bicycle paths, pedestrian paths, developing child-friendly roads and streetscaping. 
 
 This discussion will centre around modernization of city buses, improving the bus bays and depots, procuring more buses to reduce waiting time for commuters at bus stops and re-designing the stoppages. Currently, there are around 125 buses being run by BPTSL while there's an additional requirement of 400 buses in the city.
