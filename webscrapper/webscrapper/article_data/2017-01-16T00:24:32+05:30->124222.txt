 An expert present at the discussion said that one exam can’t serve two purposes of licensing and of an entrance exam as both assess different capacities of candidates. 
 
 Chief advisor of MARD, Sagar Mundada, “All agreed that standardization in medical education is necessary but NEXT is not the way out. It was suggested that the final-year exam be standardized across India to improve quality of doctors.” . The discussion was organized by the Association of Medical Consultants.
 
 Dr Pravin Shingare, director, directorate of medical education and research, said that giving licences to doctors should be the state’s prerogative. “The exit test will act as a licensing test. For 50 years, we had no test for registering doctors. This will also mean that the Centre will have a say in doctors getting a licence from the state medical council,” said Shingare. TNN
