You know that   is totally technical subject. You just can’t rely on questions asked at the end of chapters. When it comes to  , questions could be asked from any section of the chapter.

 Under such conditions, it is better for you to go through the entire chapter. I agree that not all sections in a chapter would be useful. So, if you feel that a particular section is important, highlight it by using a marker or pencil. You may read it again and again and memorize it. You may then go through this highlighted section again during your revision session.
 
 When it comes to geography, marking stuff on maps is a surprise question that may be asked. Map marking can’t be mastered just by looking and going through maps. You will have to plot the asked locations on the map and practice it. Question papers also often reveal important questions and sections, which carry high amount of marks. Be logical while answering questions in civics. If you want to score more marks, you must attempt all the questions and in points.
 
 To make you more aware, let me tell you that you may get questions related to the types of resources and conservation. Your focus should be on all main concepts in economics and learning them in relation to each other. But I’ll suggest you to not study anything extra or from a new book right before exams, as you may get confused.
 
 Revise what you have studied and glance at important notes. So, keep calm and make sure you are also spending some time playing and re-energizing yourself.
