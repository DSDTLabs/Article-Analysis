KOLKATA: Following the bus accident at   in which two college students were killed on Saturday, Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police, along with traffic and transportation engineers of the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority ( ), carried out a joint inspection of the Chingrighata and Swabhumi-Kadapara (Hyatt) crossings on Monday. A slew of changes have been proposed for three main crossings on EM Bypass — Chingrighata, Beliaghata and Swabhumi-Kadapara (Hyatt). A professor from IIT-Kharagpur was part of the inspecting team.

 “The team will prepare its report and submit it to the police soon,” said an officer.
 
  
  
 
 “We have discussed plans regarding foot overbridges with escalators and a subway. There will also be separate lanes for pedestrians and cyclists. The plans will be further tweaked,” said Kolkata Police DC (traffic) Sumit Kumar.
 
 KMDA officials, however, said there was some difficulty in setting up a subway at Chinrighata crossing since there is a canal flowing beneath it. “But there is no problem in setting up the two foot overbridges there, one from Chaulpatty Road to   and another from near Captain   to the Chingrighata flyover end,” said an officer, adding that the foot overbridges will need to have escalators, as pedestrians often avoid taking a footbridge since they have to take the stairs.
 
 Traffic police officers said the existing Sukanta Nagar bus stand at Chingrighata will be pushed back towards Captain Bheri to keep buses from creating blockages at Chingrighata. “We hope to complete work on subways at both Hyatt and   crossings by May,” said a KMDA official.
