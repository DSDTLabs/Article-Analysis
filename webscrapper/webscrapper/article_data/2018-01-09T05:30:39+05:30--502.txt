MANGALURU: Abdul Basheer, the 48-year-old man who was murdered in retaliation to the killing of Hindu activist  , was laid to rest to as per Islamic rituals at Mohiuddin Juma Masjid premises, Kuloor-Panjimogaru, near here, on Sunday.

 Basheer was attacked by four persons on the night of January 3, hours after Deepak died in Katipalla following an attack allegedly by members of a minority community. Basheer, who was returning home after a day’s work at the fast-food outlet which he ran, was left for dead. He was found by an ambulance driver 15 minutes later and was shifted to a private hospital. Doctors had performed multiple surgeries on him to save his life. He succumbed to his injuries on Sunday morning.
 
 Basheer is survived by wife, three sons and a daughter. The eldest son is married and his daughter is pursuing PU. The youngest son is a Class 8 student. Although the funeral was to be held soon after the autopsy in the morning, the family waited for one of the victim’s sons to arrive from Abu Dhabi, where he is working.
 
 
 
 
 As soon as the news of his passing spread, hundreds of people flocked to the hospital. Among them were food minister UT Khader, Mangaluru City North MLA BA   and former minister  . However, a slogan-shouting group asked Palemar, who tried speaking to the media, to leave, exhorting him not to politicize the death.
 
 Sources said Basheer’s family had requested police and well-wishers not to take his body on a procession from the hospital to his house in Akash Bhavan. The body was transported to the house for final viewing around noon. Only family members were allowed to pay their respects. Thereafter, the body was taken for burial.
