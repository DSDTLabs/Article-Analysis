Celebrities of this era are having tough time coping with the trolls and memes made on them. Irrespective of the popularity or fan following they have, every actor is being trolled on social media for something or the other. But, recently a video has gone viral on social media after a TV channel’s VJs were seen making derogatory comments on  .

 VJs Sangeetha and   while hosting the show ‘Franka Sollatta’ have made comments about Suriya’s height. In the video   was seen commenting, “Looks like director KV Anand has approached   to be part of Suriya’s 37, but Amitabh hasn’t confirmed on the move. In case he accepts, this could be the first Tamil film Amitabh Bachchan would be acting in."
 
 Meanwhile, Nivedhitha starts giggling and Sangeetha asks why, for which, mocking Suriya's height she says, "Aren't there any actors in Tamil. For Anushka itself it was funny and for this I don't know where they will keep the stool."
 
 Sangeetha joins taking a dig at Suriya saying, For Anushka itself, he had to wear heels to maintain the height gap, now he will have to stand in a stool to cope with Amitabh’s height.”   was also seen saying, “They could shoot the entire film by having scenes where the actors sit and not stand.”
 
 The VJs have been severely criticised for their unprofessional behaviour by Suriya fans and public on social media.
