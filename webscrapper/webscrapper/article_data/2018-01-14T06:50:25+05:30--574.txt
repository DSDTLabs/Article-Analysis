VIJAYAWADA: The city police and political leaders are locked in a bitter tussle over cockfights in the state, with both sides coming up with their own interpretation of the   orders. 

 Organisers argue that according to the   order, cockfights can be conducted as part of tradition. On the other hand, the police say the SC never gave permission for cockfights, and that any kind of gambling or betting and tying of knives to roosters will attract criminal action.
 
 Unlike last year, police have come down heavily on cockfight organisers. The city police conducted raids on cockfight arenas at various places, and stopped organisers from making arrangements for competitions. Joint commissioner of police BV   and DCP   monitored the raids at   near Kankipadu. They made organisers leave the area where arrangements for cockfights were being made.
 
 Ramana Kumar said they will not allow cockfights in the jurisdiction of Vijayawada commissionerate. "  and the   have given specific orders to curb gambling and animal cruelty in the name of tradition. We are bound to implement the orders and urge people not to participate," he said.
