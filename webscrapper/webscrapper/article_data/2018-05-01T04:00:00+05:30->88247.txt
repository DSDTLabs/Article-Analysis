Surat/Bharuch: Former Congress MLA from Vagra constituency in Bharuch district Iqbal Patel died after battling with cancer in Mumbai on Saturday.  He was elected as MLA in 1998 and 2007 assembly elections from Vagra. In 2009, Congress had made him chief whip of the party in the state assembly. Despite several upheavals, he remained loyal to the Congress and was considered close to senior leader Ahmed Patel. Patel expressed grief at the passing away of Patel and said he was a soft-spoken and popular leader in the district.  Patel was hospitalized in Mumbai for treatment. He is survived by wife Rashida Patel, who had also won the Vagra seat in 2002.
