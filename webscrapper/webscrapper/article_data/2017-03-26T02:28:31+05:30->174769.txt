 As she waited her turn, some other   ahead in the queue got into an argument over who was to go next ,which led to chaos in the hospital.
 
 Patience wore thin at the hospital on Saturday, as patients were made to wait for hours for ultrasound and X-ray tests. A few were even denied the service and were told to return on Monday.
 
 This was the last straw. Patients waiting their turn since morning lost their temper and exchanged heated arguments with the hospital staff. When the guard on duty tried to intervene, the angry crowd surrounded him, leading to utter chaos. Things cooled down only after senior officials from the hospital management pacified the patients.
