Bhopal: A track for public   sharing scheme appears to have hit a roadblock after former BJP MLA Shailandra Pradhan began a protest on Monday against proposed demolition of structures, including houses coming in the way of the track. 

 Pradhan said, “People in Ahmadpur locality on Hoshangabad Road have been living for more than 100 years and the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) declares houses as illegal. Reports said the BMC wants to demolish them.”
 
 “People are agitated and worried about demolition of their houses. All this to pave way for the cycle track, a green corridor and service road,” he said. Pradhan, however, ended the protest after an hour after senior BJP leaders persuaded him to do so.
 
 “BMC chairman Surjeet Singh Chouhan came to meet me and promised that no demolition will take place,” Pradhan said, adding, “We have also submitted him a memorandum giving all details of the area.” Some part of the cycle track has already been constructed on the Hoshangabad Road.
 
 Pradhan said nobody in the area is opposing development in the city and development of facilities, but not at the cost of the destruction of prime property. About 12 km cycle track is proposed from Misrod till the Link Road number 1.
