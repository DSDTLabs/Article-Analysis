AGARTALA: Chief minister Biplab Kumar   on Saturday announced that the government will provide one lakh   connections to poor women under the Pradhan   (PMUY) by the next 100 days. In a public programme on Saturday, Deb said PM   had launched the PMUY scheme long ago with the mission to achieve a smoke-free India, but the previous state government failed to implement the initiative. 

 Deb informed that 53.68% households of the state have LPG connections while more than 67% families live below the poverty line. 
 
 "I have already requested Indian Oil authority to provide one lakh LPG connections to poor women under PMUY by next 100 days and hopefully we shall be able to achieve the target," he said. The scheme was launched in 2016 in the country while the process for its implementation in   began in September 2017. TNN
