CHENNAI: For three months, children from the fishing hamlet of   on the   beach were exposed to photography using high-end digicams as part of an afterschool class. A collection of 50 photos were on display at Spaces on Saturday. And the kids had a special guest in film   who took keen interest in their artistic endeavour.

 “Digitisation has broken barriers and ensured the democratisation of artistic expression," Ranjith, who recently directed the Rajnikanth blockbuster Kabali, said. He was interacting with singer  , who is part of the Urur-Olcott Kuppam festival scheduled for February 10 and 11.
 
 The photographs had a simple theme ­-capturing the daily lives of the fishing community . While one depicted boats heading out to sea, another captured their homes and the frugal food they ate. Another had children playing with stray pups.
 
 Art is the most effective tool of expression for marginalised, said Ranjith, whose three movies have been on the vibrancy and politics of these sections. “Every photo displayed here tells a story.Art is common to all and availability of technology can break the shackles,“ he said.
 
 Krishna, whose oratory and writing skills have stirred a hornet's nest for a few years now, asked Ranjith why there was opposition to mixing politics and art. “I've never seen it as different.When people from marginalised communities express themselves, it becomes political. In India, my food, beef, has been politicised. Only art can bridge the wide gap that exists between the haves and have-nots in the country," Ranjith said.
