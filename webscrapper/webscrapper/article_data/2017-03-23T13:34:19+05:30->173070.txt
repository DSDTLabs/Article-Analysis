 The doctor, who served as MARD president 1979-1983, remembers how back then resident doctors took the then   regime head-on after the government announced plans to start a three-year MBBS course for rural areas. "We thought they were favouring a few parts of the state and trying to create a back-door entry into the medical profession. The protests went on for weeks before the government was dissolved all of a sudden," he says, adding that threats of termination too are not new for resident doctors.
 
 Security, stipend, living conditions and human rights of doctors have remained points of contention for the last three decades. "Almost all strikes have occurred over these issues, which means they have remained unresolved," Dr Kumar says. "The reasons could be that doctors have no political affiliations. Nor do they form a vote bank for any election."
 
 He says resident doctors are some of the best minds in the country and practically run public medical institutions. "Society should demand more accountability from the government, rather than having unrealistic expectations from these student doctors."
