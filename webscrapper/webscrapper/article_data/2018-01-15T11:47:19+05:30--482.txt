PANAJI: An Olive Ridley   arrived at   beach in   on Sunday morning, a visit that provided some relief to lovers of the flippered visitors in the state. 

 The female turtle landed at 4am and crawled straight towards the interpretation centre overlooking the mouth of the river Chapora. “The eggs laid did not have to be relocated as the nest was dug within the turtle nesting site,” a source said.
 
 While the beach stretch from the river mouth till almost the first shack towards north at   in Morjim has been demarcated as turtle nesting site, the turtles often surface in the area beyond the shacks. The eggs then have to be buried in a pit within the safe zone.
 
 With this nest laid at Morjim on Sunday, the tally has crawled to three.   and Galgibaga in  , and   in Pernem, are the other sites. The first nest laid on October 19 at Agonda has already yielded 41 hatchlings out of 92 eggs. Just over a week ago, a second nest was laid on the same beach.
 
 Mandrem and Galgibaga are yet to receive any flippered visitors for nesting so far, sources said. 
 
 The last season was very productive, with a total of more than 2,800 hatchlings released at four turtle nesting sites till May. A few more crawled to sea during the monsoon.
