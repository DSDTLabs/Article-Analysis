PATNA: Renowned economist   on Saturday recalled the contributions of freedom fighter Anugraha Narayan Sinha as an architect of modern Bihar and a staunch opponent of imperialism.

 The JNU-Delhi professor was delivering a lecture on “A climacteric for capitalism”, organised by A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies in memory of the state’s first deputy CM.
 
 “The social gulf has widened in the advanced countries under neo-liberal capitalism. The increase in income inequality, and its implications are matters of concern for democracy,” Patnaik said and wondered whether capitalism would restructure itself to come out of its current crisis by accepting the concept of welfare state. 
 
 Magadh University VC Prof Qamar Ahsan was the chief guest on the occasion.
 
 The participants were welcomed by institute’s director Prof Sunil Ray who stressed on limitations of intellectual engagement with isolated socio economic issues. He highlighted contemporary capitalism’s struggle to maintain its hegemony and overcoming its inherent contradictions.
 
 Institute’s registrar Prof Nil Ratna presented the vote of thanks.
