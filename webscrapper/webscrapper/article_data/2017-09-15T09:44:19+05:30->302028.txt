BENGALURU: At a time when the government is thinking of   and   to bring in  , an US environment expert deplored such attempts of `geo-engineering', saying they are unsustainable.

 In a chat with TOI in Bengaluru, Leah Bamberger, director of sustainability for the city of Providence Rhode Island, spoke on environmental issues plaguing modern cities and possible solutions for problems like climate change. Bamberger, a climate reliance expert, is meeting stakeholders, including heads of governments and civil society members, in India.
 
 “Steps like seeking fake rain, changing the course of rivers and linking them amount to geo-engineering, which is not sustainable. Instead, the focus should be on building infrastructure to ensure better utilization of resources,“ said Bamberger.
 
 Drawing a parallel between the Houston floods and the flash floods in Bengaluru, Bamberger said the calamities were the outcome of bad town planning in both cities.
 
 She refused to blame cli mate change alone to the extreme weather conditions that cities often witness. “I avoid saying that. We need to look at the big picture when we are analysing such issues.Over-industrialization and urbanization are among the reasons,“ she pointed out.
 
 Referring to the highly polluted waterbodies in Bengaluru such as the foaming Bellandur Lake, Bamberger said the solution is an efficient system to manage waste water, storm water and solid waste.
 
 Taking the US example, she said civil society should be proactive and pressure the governments to make them compliant with environment conservation. Citizens must take up the responsibility and ensure residential and commercial buildings are complaint with green norms.
