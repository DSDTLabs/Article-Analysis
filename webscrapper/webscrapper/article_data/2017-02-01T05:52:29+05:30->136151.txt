GUWAHATI: After  , the Centre has now withdrawn NSG cover for another former chief minister,  , but has retained the   cover for Gogoi. 

 While Gogoi's security will be taken care of by state police, Mahanta will be guarded by CRPF personnel.
 
 According to the order issued by ministry of home affairs, the decision to have CRPF cover for Mahanta has been taken after reviewing his security arrangements in the ministry in consultation with central security agencies and getting approval from the 'competent authority.'
 
 "Accordingly, CRPF is requested to provide Z+ category mobile security cover in Assam to PK Mahanta immediately," the order stated.
 
 The home ministry has also requested the DGP to provide logistic support to CRPF, including threat inputs, in order to enable them to provide adequate security to the protectee.
 
 When contacted for his reaction, Mahanta said, "I am not obsessed with security covers. Unless one has the support of people, no cover can provide security." 
 
 Gogoi, on the other hand, said the Centre's move is in bad taste. "This is unprecedented for any government to withdraw NSG cover," he added
