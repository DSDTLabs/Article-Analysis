PANAJI: Pointing out that shortage of government land and high standard of living were affecting the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin), minister for rural development and housing   asked the Union ministry of rural development and   to consider a special scheme to meet the need for housing in Goa. 

 Salgaonkar further said that reluctance to donate land and the prolonged land acquisition process was hampering the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana.
 
 The   met with Union minister for rural development and panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi.
 
 The peculiar topography and demography of Goa and the various bottlenecks are affecting the smooth implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Ownership of lands, objections and rejections by local authorities of the beneficiaries and requirement of a fresh socio-economic caste census were some of the bottlenecks, Salgaonkar told Tomar.
 
 According to a note issued by the government, Salgaonkar suggested that the Union ministry could consider a special scheme to meet the need for affordable housing in Goa by relaxing the conditions of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
 
 Salgaonkar also mentioned that Goan villages are semi-urban in nature and the state road network covered almost every part of Goa. There is however, a need for roads in some pockets in Goan villages but land owners are reluctant to donate lands, Salgaonkar said.
 
 The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Gramin) can be suitably converted to cover the water ways so that inaccessible villages can be covered through water transport, Salgaonkar recommended.
