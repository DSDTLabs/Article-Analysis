PANAJI: Corporation of the City of   (CCP) on Thursday threatened to revoke permissions granted to   to lay the piped natural gas network in the capital. The civic body’s grouse is that   has started work before the council could take a decision on the matter and that Goa Natural Gas has just paid one-third of the fees that CCP stipulates.

 The issue created a ruckus at the ordinary council meeting that was held on Thursday, with the council issuing an ultimatum to the company to pay the entire amount of Rs 97 lakh within a week’s time.
 
 As per the rate fixed by CCP, a fee of Rs 2,000 per meter will be charged to any entity for digging of road and footpath and laying of utility services within CCP limits. But, commissioner Ajit Roy has charged one third of the amount and has asked Goa Natural Gas to pay Rs 32,33,333 (Rs 32.33 lakh).
 
 Roy has argued out that as per the Union government’s norms, utility services that are backed by the Union government, such as the natural gas pipeline should be charged one-third of the prevailing rates.
 
 Goa Natural Gas has proposed to dig up 4,850m of road to lay the city gas distribution network in the first phase.
 
 The project, once complete, envisages the supply of natural gas to households, commercial and setting up of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations for vehicles.
 
 “Natural gas is 23% cheaper than a subsidized LPG cylinder and 53% cheaper than a non-subsidised cylinder,” chief executive officer of Goa Natural Gas K K Sachdeva said.
 
 For the councilors, the loss of revenue was the sore point, since CCP lacked funds for development.
 
 “All the time when we ask for development works, we are told that there are no funds. Now when we can get funds, why should we forgo it,” councilor Soraya Pinto Makhija said.
