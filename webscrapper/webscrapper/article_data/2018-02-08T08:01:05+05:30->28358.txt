AMRITSAR: The Amritsar unit of Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to condemn the alleged interference of   MP   in the functioning of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital.

 General secretary of the association Dr   Singh, in a release issued here on Wednesday alleged that  , during his visit to hospital on February 6, also brought officials of the vigilance department and few ‘unruly’ persons of some NGOs along with him.
 
 “The MP, vigilance officials and outsiders visited the blood bank and also asked irrelevant questions in the orthopaedic department. They asked questions about treatment protocols and implants prescribed by qualified doctors and questioned whether they were required or not,” he said, adding that not only the faculty was humiliated and demoralized, image of the institution was also tarnished.
 
 The release further states that the MP visited the hospital without informing the authorities managing the government medical college and allied hospitals. “In protest, we have decided to go on one day strike on February 8,” Dr Karamjit mentioned in the release.
 
 Meanwhile, Amritsar MP   said his office had received numerous reports of alleged negligence on part of the doctors and functioning of the blood bank and other departments of the hospital.
 
 “This hospital is always in news for the wrong reasons. I am a public representative and have constitutional right to monitor the departments. I have told them several times to regulate their services and provide best medical care and facilities to the patients but they didn’t listen so I had to go and monitor their functioning and I will keep going there,” he said, adding that there was a nexus of doctors who were irked by his action. He said it was due to hospital staff’s negligence that government was earning a bad name.
