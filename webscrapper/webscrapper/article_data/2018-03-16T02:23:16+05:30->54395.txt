Mumbai: Nearly 40,000   were in for a shock on Thursday when they found Rs 500 deducted from   towards recovery of 10% of Diwali bonus paid last year. The salary too came late—on the 15th instead of 10th. Upset, the BEST Workers’ Union decided to   outside all 26   in the city on Friday from 1.30pm. BEST services will not be affected as only employees who are off-duty will be on protest.

 “We feel cheated...The bonus was not deducted from January salary,” said union leader Shashank Rao, adding that many workers have not yet received  . “They are unable to seek loan from credit societies.” 
 
 Senior BEST officials said the protest was uncalled for. “We had decided to recover the Rs 5,000 bonus in instalments and had deferred the process by a month,” said an official. “The management has decided to go paperless. Employees can send an email seeking a salary slip or get it via the website or mobile app.” A senior official said the BEST can give salaries latest by the 15th of the month. 
 
 Sources said the BMC is taking back the bonus as the transport body ‘failed’ to implement a slew of reforms suggested for financial revival. —Somit Sen
