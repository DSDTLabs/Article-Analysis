CHENNAI: DMK working president   on Wednesday welcomed the move by   chief minister   to meet his   counterpart, Siddaramaiah and request in person for release of Cauvery river water for the benefit of farmers in the delta districts in the state.

 “The chief minister should take a delegation of leaders from the opposition parties as well as representatives of the   farmers while meeting the Karnataka chief minister. Only then, the visit will achieve something meaningful,” he said. “If needed, he should lead a delegation of opposition leaders to meet the prime minister to achieve the purpose,” he added.
 
 Stalin said such a visit should have been undertaken much earlier. “Even though it is belated, it is a welcome move,” Stalin told reporters, during a visit to his Kolathur assembly constituency on Wednesday.
 
 Stalin said with the state government failing to roll back bus fare hike as demanded by all, a meeting of the opposition leaders will again be convened on February 6 to decide on the next course of action. The opposition parties led by the DMK held protests across the state on Monday to force the state government to withdraw the steep increase in bus fare.
 
 Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Stalin urged CM Palaniswami to meet the Prime Minister and the president to get the Centre’s nod for the ordinance passed by the state assembly seeking exemption from NEET for Tamil Nadu.
