Author-poet   in her poem, From The Ganga To The Tay, weaves in tales of two countries — India and   — through an imagined conversation between two rivers. In a packed auditorium at the ICCR, a group of artistes on Saturday staged a dance-drama based on the poem.

  
 Conceptualised by filmmaker Amalesh Dasgupta and choreographed by Rhythmosaic Dance Institute, the dance-drama showcases the mythic origins, sacredness and the history that these two rivers have witnessed. 
 Speaking on the occassion, Basabi said, “Though a poet should never be speechless, I’m at a loss of words today to see such an overwhelming response from you all. Rivers love the diversity on its banks and through the 
 conversation between the Tay and the Ganga, I tried to tell the stories of Kolkata and Dundee, which is situated on the banks of the Tay.” 
 
  
 The dance-drama is part of a series of programmes celebrating 70 years of cultural relations between India and Britain.
 While Agnimitra Paul welcomed the guests, Goutam Ghose, Neelanjana Ghose, Goutam De and other eminent personalities were spotted at the do.
