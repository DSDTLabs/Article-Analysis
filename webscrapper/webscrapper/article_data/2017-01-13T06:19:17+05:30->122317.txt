PUNE: Chief minister   will be the face of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election campaign in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.

 “The recent polls have proved that Fadnavis holds all the aces — BJP won the highest-number of seats. He was able to tear through the areas dominated by NCP and Congress,” a senior BJP leader from the city said.
 
 The CM has taken a keen interest in the city’s issues, Ganesh Bidkar, a BJP leader in  , said. “The development plan, sanctioned by the state recently, has been appreciated by everyone, including the opposition parties,” he added, pointing out that the party has a strong team of leaders at the state and Centre to take the campaign forward. 
 
 Party sources said the CM’s “clean image” will play a key role. “There has not been a single allegation against the chief minister in the last two-and-half years. Most leaders in the NCP and Congress are tainted. Even those have been leading Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for the last 10 years have been criticized. Citizens here are smart enough,” sources said. 
 
 Fadnavis has been attending ward-level public functions. Political quarters would want to see if NCP leader   brings his might to bear in the election campaign in support of his nephew Ajit Pawar.
