The wine industry is not enjoying any high after this year’s Budget as none of their proposals has been addressed to.

 Housing 39 of the total 95 wineries in the country, the proposal from the industry to revive the Indian Grape Processing Board ( ), dissolved three years ago, did not find a mention in the Budget. 
 
 The ministry of food processing industries set up the IGPB at Pune in 2009 to promote and regulate grape processing activities and improve the standards of wine production. The 15-member board was suspended in February 2015. 
 
 Wine Tourism Advisory Committee chairman Jagdish Holkar said, “There is no mention of the wine sector in the  . We feel that the government is treating wine as an alcoholic beverage and not a part of the agro-processing sector. There is no substantial provision for agro-processing. We have very little focus on agro-processing as compared to foreign countries. Around 95% of the agriculture produce is still sold as raw goods.” Holkar said, adding that   will not be benefited until their produce is processed. Citing the reasons, the wine industry had appealed to the union government to revive the IGPB. 
 
 “There has been nothing on this front. There is a need to bring wine in the Goods Services Tax to have a uniform tax structure. On this front too, we are left high and dry by the government,” added Holkar.
 
 Yatin Patil, president of All India Wine Producers Association, is positive about the Budget still benefiting grape farmers and, eventually, the wine industry. 
 
 “There is a provision of Rs 1 lakh crore for agricultural credit, which might benefit farmers. The government has also increased the crop insurance and made a provision of Rs 9,000 crore,” Patil said.
