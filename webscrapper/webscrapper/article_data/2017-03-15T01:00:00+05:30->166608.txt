PATNA: A large number of ATMs ran out cash on the day after Holi even as banks remained shut for the fourth consecutive day on Tuesday for the festivities.

 On the last working day on Friday before the banks were closed for Holi, bank officials had claimed there would be no cash crunch during their holiday as they had taken care to stuff the ATMs with cash to the full.
 
 However, most of the   kiosks had their shutters down on Tuesday, and people had to return empty- handed and move from one ATM to another to draw money. The silver lining was that most of the ATMs located next to bank branches had cash in them.
 
 A police officer, Anil Kumar, had to come all the way from Gola Road on the city’s western outskirts to an ATM at Gandhi Maidan. “I hopped from one ATM to another... Most of them were empty. I also had an additional work at Gandhi Maidan or, else, I would have returned home without withdrawing money,” the cop with Economic Offences Unit told TOI on Tuesday evening.
 
 This reporter visited Gandhi Maidan, Boring Road, Boring Canal Road, Nala Road and Fraser Road areas, and found many ATMs having run dry. “Worse, there are no guards to answer our queries,” rued Santosh Kumar, one of the disappointed customers.
 
 Patna University student Amit Kumar, standing near a cash-dry ATM on Nala Road, was livid. “Banks charge us for their services... If ATMs do not have cash, it should be considered deficiency in service and banks should be penalised for it,” said the 22-year-old.
 
 This reporter came across Bhagwan Das, a guard at an ATM on Boring Canal Road (east), who had a simple explanation: Cash was loaded three days ago on Friday and, therefore, the machine became empty by Tuesday morning.
