The forest department imposed fines on two people on Wednesday for allegedly felling 10 trees near Jalvayu Tower, a residential society in Sector 56. An official said they also chopped 120 tree branches with a width of more than 70cm. The matter came to light after residents filed a complaint with the forest department. “The trees were cut from a nearby green belt. We immediately raised an alarm. When we stopped the driver of the tractor, they told us they have been hired by the authorities,” said VMK Singh, a resident of Suncity, a township in Sector 54. According to sources in the forest department, the two people were fined for cutting trees. “It has been found that these people were contractors of one of the authorities. We have penalised them and will make sure that an appropriate action will be taken against them,” said a forest officer. TNN
