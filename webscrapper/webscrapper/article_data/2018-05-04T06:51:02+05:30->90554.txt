MUMBAI: Almost two years into his incarceration in a money laundering case, former deputy chief minister  , who has moved the Bombay high court for bail, will know the outcome on Friday. 

 Bhujbal (71) sought bail after the Supreme Court last December scrapped a provision in a special law that had made seeking bail difficult. Bhujbal through his counsel Vikram Chaudhary argued that since the SC had last November struck down Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which required the accused to show that he is not involved in money laundering, his bail should be considered in regular course. Several accused facing   charges were released on bail, he pointed. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for Enforcement Directorate, argued that even though section 45 is quashed, Bhujbal has to contend with Section 24 of PMLA, which stipulates "presumption'' of money laundering. It says: "When a person is accused of having committed the offence... burden of proving that proceeds of crime are untainted property shall be on the accused.'' But Bhujbal's counsel said that this section kicks in only during trial and not at the bail stage. Singh said it would apply even at the stage of a bail hearing.
