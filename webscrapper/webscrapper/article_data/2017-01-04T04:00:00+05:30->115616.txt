Mumbai: BSE, the oldest stock exchange in Asia, on Tuesday got the go-ahead from markets regulator   to launch its  , which is estimated to be worth Rs 1,500 crore. In September,   had filed its draft offer document with Sebi. 

 The bourse is not raising any money through the IPO since it does not need any cash now. Only some of the existing shareholders of the exchange, mostly its broker-members, are offloading their stake in the IPO. The draft of the IPO launch is yet to be decided.
 
 The IPO will sell nearly 3 crore shares of the exchange translating into about 30% of its equity. BSE’s shares will be listed on the NSE, the largest stock exchange in India in terms of turnover and also its biggest competitor, since Sebi does not allow “self-listing”, i.e. listing of a bourse’s shares on its own trading platform. In late December,   too filed a draft prospectus for going public. Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), a commodities derivatives bourse, is the only listed exchange in India.
 
 Sebi’s latest update on the status of various draft offers filed with it showed that BSE has received the regulatory observation on its IPO, which allows it to go ahead with the offer. 
 
 Among BSE’s existing shareholders, the Singapore Exchange, Quantum Fund (owned by billionaire investor George Soros), Bajaj Holdings Investment and Citigroup Global Markets are selling in the IPO.
 
 Edelweiss Financial Services, Axis Capital, Jefferies India, Nomura Financial Advisory, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, SBI Capital Markets and SMC Capitals are managing the offer.
