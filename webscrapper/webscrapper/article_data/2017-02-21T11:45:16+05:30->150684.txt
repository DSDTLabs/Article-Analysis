PATNA: Bihar assembly Speaker   on Monday termed the recent ruckus in   as an “ominous sign” for Indian parliamentary system.

 At an interaction with select journalists ahead of the state legislature’s Budget session, Choudhary said either the 10th Schedule of our Constitution or the Anti-defection Law, 1985, does not prescribe any code to conduct a secret ballot. “Yet   threw chairs, toppled tables and yanked mics because   did not heed their demand for secret voting during the trust vote sought by  ,” he rued. 
 
 Choudhary pointed out as per law, legislators have an obligation to vote according to the whip of their party. Not doing so may invite action as provided for in the Schedule. “If secret ballot is permitted, it would not be possible to identify whether or not an MLA voted according to the party whip,” Choudhary said.
 
 He said it was high time political parties sat together and took a clear stand on the vexed issue. “As rules do not permit secret ballot, political parties should stop demanding it,” he added.
 
 Choudhary also urged the media to be responsible while covering assembly proceedings. “Those who disturb the House proceedings should not be made heroes. People should be informed about the details of deliberations, not disturbances,” he said.
 
 The Speaker also expressed concern over legislators’ “lack of interest” in proceedings of the House. “Empty chairs in the assembly give me nightmares,” he said and called upon the elected representatives to actively participate in the House debates.
