 LONDON: A 33-year-old British-Pakistani man was on Wednesday found guilty of kidnapping, raping and killing his 20-year-old Indian-origin niece by a   court.

  killed   in a jealous rage by slitting her throat and then dumped her body into a freezer, the Old   court here was told during the trial.
 
 The builder from London was also found guilty of the attempted murder of a second 21-year-old Indian-origin woman, who was a friend of the victim and managed to escape with serious injuries during the attack last year.
 
 Meanwhile, co-accused   — a labourer employed by the builder — was acquitted of all charges against him.
