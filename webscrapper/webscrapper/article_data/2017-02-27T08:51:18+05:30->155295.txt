Ahmedabad: A Rajkot shopkeeper will have to go to   to serve his three-month sentence in a 22-year-old food adulteration case, as   high court upheld his conviction and three-month sentence.

 A food inspector filed a complaint under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act against Naresh   in January 1995. This happened after the official collected samples of ‘chana dal’ and sent it to a laboratory for tests. The report revealed that the samples did have a label with a batch number of the food product. This was in violation of the law. After getting consent from the concerned health authority to file the complaint, the food inspector filed his complaint at a magisterial court.
 
 The magisterial court held Rathod guilty and sentenced him to a three-month jail term in 2003. The next year, a sessions court rejected his appeal. He approached the high court, which found the lower courts’ decisions correct. Upholding the conviction, the HC directed Rathod to surrender to jail authorities in a month’s time.
