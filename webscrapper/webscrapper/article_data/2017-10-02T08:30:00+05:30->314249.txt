Chandigarh: Scared by the number of customers moving consumer court to settle their disputes with shopkeepers, local trade body Chandigarh Business Council has thought of a novel thing to regain their faith. In a month, it will offer them an alternative platform for redress—a mobile-phone app.

 The app is aimed at bridging the communication gap between the shopkeeper and customer, and guiding the tourists. The council hopes that restored faith will enhance business so that the market gets out of a slump. “If any product is found defective or faulty, why should the customers be harassed, when it is our duty to satisfy them. They can send us the complaint over the upcoming app and we will fix it. They’ll even be able to share feedback with us,” council president Neeraj Bajaj said. He runs a shop in Sector 17.
 
 “Since most of the customers in Chandigarh are from outside, the app will also guide them to the shops and tell them which mode of travel to take. We have involved young businessmen and volunteers to make the optimum use of technology. The app’s content will be updated regularly,” Bajaj said. The council CBC has 300 members and it targets to take the number to 600 in a few days. It will offer them the app so that they can stay in touch with the customers and enhance their business.
