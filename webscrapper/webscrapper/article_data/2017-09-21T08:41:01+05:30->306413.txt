HYDERABAD: Over 2,000 passengers were left stranded at the city's   ( ) on Tuesday night -many without food and accommodation -after 16 flights to Mumbai were diverted to the Shamshabad facility on account of unfavourable weather conditions in the Maharashtra capital.

 In fact, hundreds of them were forced to stay put at the airport till late on Wednesday afternoon, with many airlines failing to accommodate them on earlier flights.
 
 While a bulk of the diverted aircrafts belonged to   ­ servicing both domestic and international circuit ­ the list included Air India, Swissair, Malaysian Airlines and   carriers.
 
 The air traffic disruptions led to massive chaos at the Hyderabad airport, as hapless passengers lashed out at airline authorities for their apathy and demanded alternative arrangements.
 
 Angry outbursts over poor communication from airline staffers and lack of basic facilities flooded social media platforms, even as operators made attempts at pacifying their guests. "The diversion wasn't in the airline's control, so we cannot complain. But what transpired later could have been managed better," said Sandeep Sharma who was on board Jet Airways' flight from Kolkata to Mumbai.
 
 The airline in an statement maintained that its "teams are working round-the-clock to ensure that inconvenience to guests is minimised and operations are normalised at the earliest," not everybody was amused. "Had they told us the waiting period would be so long, we could have checked into a hotel," said another harried passenger at RGIA.
