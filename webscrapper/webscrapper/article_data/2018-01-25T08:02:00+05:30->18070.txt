Noida: A group of students were barred from entering a private school in   for failing to pay   on time. They were reportedly sent back home and one of the parents called up police for alleged ill-treatment by the school management. The school said that they were operating as per the rules.

 The students of “Samsara —The World Academy” on Wednesday morning were turned away but the father of one Kanvi Jain, a kindergarten student objected to the treatment meted out to his daughter and called the cops.
 
 The father Sanjay Jain, a grocery shop owner in Purvanchal Silver City 2, Greater Noida, said: “Kanvi was made to sit in the school van in the cold. Is this the way a school deals with its students? My business had not been going well and I had requested the school for a fee waiver.”
 
 School principal Pravin Roy said a student’s name can be struck off the rolls if fees are not paid within three months. “We had repeatedly informed Jain that dues were pending. The child is studying on a 50% discount. We had received applications from him about fee waiver which we had considered earlier,” she said.
 
 Kasna SHO Brijesh Verma said he had not been informed about the incident.
