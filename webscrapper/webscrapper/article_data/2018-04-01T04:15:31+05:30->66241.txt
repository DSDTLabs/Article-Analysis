THANE:  , family time and feasting on various traditional goodies mark the   in the lake-city on Sunday. Dressed in their festive best, Christian families begin the celebration of their biggest festival on Saturday night with the midnight mass and spend the rest of their day meeting and wishing their relatives and friends a Happy Easter, and feasting on Easter eggs.

 “Easter is the biggest   for the Christian community as it marks the biggest miracle in the scriptures, which is Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead. It is the day we are reminded of the sacrifice he made for our sins, which gives us the biggest reason to celebrate. The day starts with attending the mass,” said a priest at St. John the Baptish Church.
 
 Following the prayers and celebration of the Eucharist in church either at Midnight mass or mass held in the morning, people spend the rest meeting relatives and friends and preparing and sharing an exhaustive array of savoury and sweet delicacies. 
 
 “Sannas and Sorpotel is a must on Easter, along with other dishes like chicken xacuti and chicken fry, pulaos, fish fry and various salads. We end the meal with Easter eggs. As this is a lot to prepare in a short time frame, the entire family comes together and prepares the meal in the morning after attending the midnight mass,” said Samantha Dias, a   2 area resident. Anne John, a Luiswadi resident said, “Easter is more about introspection of our faults and celebration of forgiveness.”
