NEW DELHI:   has set aside an   passed by a   directing a   to pay   to a flyer for being  . 

 The flyer had booked two SpiceJet tickets for a Banglore-New Delhi flight on April 21, 2010 for Rs 12,399 but alleged that when he reached the airport for boarding the flight one hour before departure, airport officials did not attend to him and the flight took off, leaving him behind.
 
 The state commission members, O P Gupta (judicial) and Anil Srivastava, however, noted a statement from the passenger which stated, “While returning from Bangalore on April 26, 2010 I missed my flight due to the reason that I reached the check-in counter 25 minutes before flight time. Although I agree it is my mistake and the check-in time is 30 minutes before flight and I reached a little late, but the flight was still there till that time.”
 
 The bench observed that that statement led to an “inevitable and inescapable” conclusion that the complainant was unable to adhere to the deadline. “If that be the case, he cannot take the advantage of his own wrong,” the commission said.
 
 According to D K Jain’s complaint, the airline had shown deficiency of service, therefore, he had claimed both the refund for purchase of tickets and also compensation towards mental and physical agony suffered. The complaint was allowed and the airline was directed to refund the amount spent by the complainant for the purchase of fresh tickets, besides the compensation. “The impugned order, since not sustainable, is to be set aside,” the bench held.
