PATNA: Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad (BJP), Bashistha Narain Singh and Mahendra Prasad alias King Mahendra (JDU), Manoj Jha and Mohammad Ashfaque Karim (RJD) Akhilesh Prasad Singh (Congress) were declared elected unopposed to the   on Thursday.

 Thursday was the last date for the withdrawal of names. State assembly secretary Ram Shreshtha Rai gave them the certificates as no seventh candidate had filed nomination papers.
 
 King Mahendra entered the Rajya Sabha seventh time while it is the fourth term for Ravi Shankar and third term for Bashistha. Akhilesh, Jha and Karim are making their debut in the Upper House. 
 
 RJD and Congress have been the main gainers at the cost of JD(U) and BJP. For, among the six seats that had fallen vacant, four belonged to JD(U) and two to BJP.
 
 Talking about the outcome of byelection after receiving his certificate of being elected, Union minister Ravi Shankar said, “What could be better for us than this that the Congress and other parties win the Lok Sabha byelections and we the general elections! It is good that they get the consolation prize and we the main prize!”
 
 He also said BJP would look into the causes of the party’s losses in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Araria byelections. 
 
 Congress’s Akhilesh said it was his first election to the Rajya Sabha, which would add to his responsibility to reinvigorate the party in Bihar. He avoided the question regarding continuance of state Congress acting president Kaukab Quadri. “The question is outside my domain,” he said.
 
 Manoj Jha said he would place the party’s line and thought forcefully in the Rajya Sabha.
