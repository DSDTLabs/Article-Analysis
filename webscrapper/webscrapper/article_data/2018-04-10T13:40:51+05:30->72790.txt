NEW DELHI: The home ministry, in view of the   called by some groups on Tuesday to protest against caste-based reservation, has advised all states and Union Territories to beef up security and take necessary precautions to prevent any untoward incident. 

  Sources said the bandh call was given through social media, apparently to counter the April 2 strike organised to protest alleged dilution of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The April 2 bandh had turned violent in many states . 
 
 The home ministry advisory issued on Monday asked states to issue prohibitory orders, if necessary, and intensify patrolling in sensitive locations so as to prevent loss of life or damage to property. 
 
 The advisory stressed that district magistrates and superintendents of police be made personally responsible for ensuring that the law and order situation remained firmly under control in areas under their jurisdiction.
