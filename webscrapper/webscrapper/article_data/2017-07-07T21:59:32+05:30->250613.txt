 The breezy romantic entertainer starts with newlyweds Pallavi (Nivetha) and Arun (Aadhi) planning their first anniversary celebrations. The story is largely set in the US.
 
 It then shifts back to Vizag where the love story of Pallavi and Uma (Nani), a PhD scholar, unfolds. There are enough scenes to establish the chemistry between the two. But fate has other plans.
 
 
 
 Till the first half,   plays out like any other routine film with the trappings of a quintessential love story, but the treatment is fresh. With striking visuals and two songs, ‘Unnatundi Gunde’ and ’Adiga Adiga’, the movie keeps one glued to the seat.
