NEW DELHI: A day after he launched a highly personal attack on PM  ,   chief   targeted   again on Monday and said he was in denial about the threat of “mass unemployment” and his “acche din” claim would take a beating.

 
 In a tweet, Rahul referred to economist Paul Krugman's remarks at an event here and said Congress had been constantly laying stress on job creation.
 
  
  
 
 “Nobel prize winning economist, Paul Krugman, confirms what we've been saying for over two years now. Mass unemployment is the biggest threat India faces. Unfortunately, we have a PM who lives in denial. Afraid his ‘acche din’ PR will take a beating,” Rahul said.
 
 The Congress chief attacked the government over its “failure” to provide two crore jobs every year as promised by Modi, and alleged it has instead taken away jobs due to demonetisation and “ill-conceived” implementation of GST.
 
 Meanwhile, after Congress declared at its plenary session it would focus on agrarian issues, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, which left the BJP-led NDA last August, announced it would work with Congress on farmers issues, hinting at a possible alliance ahead of the 2019 general elections.
 
 The Maharashtra-based party's MP   met Rahul but maintained the decision on an electoral alliance would be taken following the discussions.
 
 Congress general secretary in Maharashtra Mohan Prakash said, “We will be working together on agri issues in Maharashtra. It can be considered a pre-poll alliance in the state.”
