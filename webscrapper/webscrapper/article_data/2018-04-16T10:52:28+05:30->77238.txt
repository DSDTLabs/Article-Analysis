AHMEDABAD: After statues of political leaders being defaced and vandalized in recent past, a similar incident, that of the nameplate of a former Dalit woman   being defaced on the birth anniversary of Ambedkar came to light in Malsan village of  .

 A villager, who knew about the incident, said that the nameplate attached on the 3m long gate of a primary school in the village was found broken on Friday night.
 
 “There was a scuffle between local Dalits and   community regarding the nameplate of the former sarpanch, Gomti Ven. The Chaudharis, being dominant in the village, wanted to remove her nameplate, even though she was instrumental in building the school,” said a villager on conditions of anonymity.
 
 When Ven was contacted, her husband, Jagshi Ven, received the call and said that he did not want to discuss the issue as it may prove harmful to them. “We (Dalits) just have around 80 families in this village, while the Chaudhary community have over 300 households. So, if we speak up against them it will prove harmful for our kids,” he said.
 
 He said later, “As we are Dalits, the Chaudhary community members did not want my wife’s name on a school gate and it was defaced. They had then written name of some Shankar Chaudhary on that gate.”
 
 Babu Bhatiya, a local activist, said that Ven was Sarpanch for five years and she was replaced by a woman from Chaudhary community whose husband,  , manages affair of the village on her behalf. “After the incident, the school principal   approached the police and filed an application to investigate the case,” said Bhatiya.
 
 Police sub-inspector Harendrasinh Bhati confirmed the incident and cited technical reasons for not starting probe in the issue.
