LUCKNOW: Governor  , who had initiated his campaign for writing correct name of BR Ambedkar as ‘Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar’, is saddened over the politicisation of the issue and criticism by the SP and the BSP for UP government’s decision to implement the change.

 
 “It hurts me as I never imagined that even Ambedkar can be   as I think he is our national hero and should be above petty politics,” he said.
 
 
 However, Naik who had brought the same issue to the notice of the President,   and the Home Minister through his letters, is still waiting for a positive response from the Centre. He had also apprised BSP chief Mayawati about mistake in Ambedkar’s name, but she, too, has not responded. " I am waiting for the Centre's response and if required will write another letter," he said.
 
 
 What has pained Naik is the criticism by the SP and the BSP because the two parities had unanimously supported the amendment in Amebdkar’s name in the state assembly and the council.
