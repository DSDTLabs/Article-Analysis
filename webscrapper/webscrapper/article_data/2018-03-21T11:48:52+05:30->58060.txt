CHENNAI: Amma Makkal Munetra Kazhagam founder T T V Dhinakaran is trying to delay hearing in the two-decade-old   case pending against him before a special court for economic offences, said the  , seeking to vacate a   order staying proceedings in the case.

 On March 7, Justice M V Muralidaran passed the interim order on the criminal revision plea moved by Dhinakaran assailing the order of the additional chief metropolitan magistrate (Economic offences-II), Chennai refusing to issue copies of certain documents, including case diary, and intelligence reports sought by him to defend the case.
 
 The case pertains to the allegation that Dhinakaran acquired $1,04,93,313 in foreign exchange without obtaining prior permission from Reserve Bank of India and deposited it in the current account of Dipper Investments Limited.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing on Tuesday, the ED filed a counter affidavit saying the documents sought by the accused could not be provided as there was a bar in sharing such documents under CrPC. FERA also prohibits disclosure of department information which is highly confidential.
 
 He had also sought production of communication between high commissions of India and the ED, the affidavit said, adding that these were official communications between government departments and the accused had failed to establish the need to call for such documents. On the accusedâ€™s request to produce correspondence between ED and DVAC regarding the case against late CM Jayalalithaa, the ED said there was no necessity to produce the same. The judge posted the plea to March 22.
