Hyderabad: City-based pharma player   Pharma Limited on Tuesday said it has notched a 11.5% jump in consolidated net profit for the third quarter of FY18 at Rs 217.4 crore as compared to Rs 194.9 crore in the third quarter of FY17 despite clocking lower revenues.

 The company’s consolidated total revenues for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017, declined 16% to Rs 573.6 crore from Rs 685.1 crore in the third quarter of fiscal 2016-17. The decline in revenue during the quarter was predominantly due to large stocking quantities of generic Oseltamivir during the third quarter of last fiscal. “The company is very pleased to show strong earnings during the quarter in spite of loss of exclusivity for generic Oseltamivir in the USA market,” it said. “We launched several new products in the US market recently that includes generic versions of Glatiramer Acetate, Oseltamivir suspension, Liposomal Doxurubicin and Lanthanum Carbonate, and continue to believe in strong growth,” it said.
