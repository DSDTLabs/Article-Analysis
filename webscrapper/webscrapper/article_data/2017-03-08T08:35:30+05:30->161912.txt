CHANDIGARH: More   are moving towards financial independence and are getting an education, if statistics in the   2015-16 (NFHS-4) are to be believed. However, health has taken a toll, as more of them have developed anaemia, obesity, and hypertension.

 According to the survey by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, the number of women having a savings bank account in Punjab has gone up from 14.6% in 2005-06 to 58.8% in 2015-16. For women in urban areas, the figure is 65%, while that for rural areas is 54.9%.
 
 Punjab’s women have outdone their Haryana counterparts in this. Only 45.6% women in the neighbouring state have a savings bank account, according to the survey.
 
 There are also 57.2% women in the state who use mobile phones. This category was not there in the previous survey. For women in cities, this figure is 71.9%. In rural areas, only 47.9% own mobile phones of their own. 
 
 When it comes to literacy, there has been a nearly 13% jump in women getting an education. Women’s literacy has shot up from 68.7% in 2005-06 to 81.4% in 2015-16. Sex rato, too, has improved, with number of females per 1,000 males rising from 882 2005-2006 to 905 in 2015-16.
 
 A professor at the Population Research Centre of the Centre for Research at Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID),  , said although the rise in number of women having savings bank accounts was a positive sign, this was possibly because most government schemes now required an account for direct transfer of benefits. “Some of these (bank accounts) might be zero or low balance accounts,” he said. 
 
 HEALTH MATTERS
 
 The health of women in Punjab has taken a beating in the past 10 years, shows NFHS-4. According to the survey report, the number of overweight or obese women in the state has gone up from 29.9% to 31.3% in 10 years. Also, 10.5% women in the state have slight hypertension and 2% of them have “moderately high levels” of the health condition. There are no figures available in this category for the 2005-06 period. Women who have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS has increased from 23% to 49.3%.
