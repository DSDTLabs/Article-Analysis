PATNA: In a first of its kind action in the state, the   (ED) has initiated the process to attach properties of two top Maoist leaders following a letter received from Bihar police in this regard.
 
  Names of at least 10 more leaders are in the pipeline for action under the   (PMLA), 2002.
  
  Sources said the ED has initiated action against   and  , who are most wanted in Bihar and Jharkhand. Sandeep carries Rs5 lakh reward on his head in Bihar and Rs25 lakh in Jharkhand. The Bihar government has announced Rs50,000 on Pradyuman while he carries a reward of Rs5 lakh in Jharkhand.
  
  “The two Maoist leaders have several immovable properties in Bihar,” sources said, adding that they have also amassed benami properties worth several crores in the name of their kith and kin in the two states.
  
  A source said the Maoist leaders have also invested huge amount of money in construction firms through different sources in the Bihar and a few other neighbouring states. “Details of persons who had made such investments and also supplied arms and ammunition to the   have also been gathered,” sources said.
  
  They also said the work to identify the properties and bank accounts of the Maoists were going on for the past several months following the demonetisation of old Rs1000 and Rs500 notes from November 8 last year as they deposited huge amount of extortion money in several bank accounts which were flagged by the intelligence agencies.
  
  When contacted, IG (operation) Kundan Krishnan said four more Maoist leaders are on the list of those whose property details have been collected to be sent to the ED for attachment very soon while work was on against several other leaders.
  
  “Most of these properties were in the name of their relatives. This proves that the Maoists are not revolutionaries but like other criminals who lead a lavish life with money extorted from businessmen and villagers,” Krishnan said.
