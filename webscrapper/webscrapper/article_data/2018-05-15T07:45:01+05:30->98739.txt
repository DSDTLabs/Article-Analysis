He lost his father hours before the mathematics exam but appeared for it and scored a perfect 100 as it was his father's favourite subject. 

 It was a very difficult time for class XII student of   Kanpur Road  , who scored 98.25% overall but he is assured he made his father proud. 
 
 "My father worked in an insurance company. He suffered a heart attack and was admitted in a private hospital while examinations were on. He asked my mother to tell me that he was fine and I should focus on the board examination. On the day of my mathematics paper, my mother called me from hospital around 10am to inform me that my father had passed away. I was shocked and felt I would not be able to take the exam," said Anmol, who has also qualified   and is confident of making it to IIT by qualifying JEE Advanced. 
 
 Anmol rushed to the hospital in tears but was requested by his mother to go to school as his father's last wish was that he scores well in mathematics. 
 
 "My father used to help me in studying mathematics. I was shattered, but I came back from the hospital, wore my school uniform and appeared for the exam which was from 2pm. I scored 100 in maths for my father but he is not with me to celebrate my success," said Anmol, who, after the examination, completed the last rites of his father.   also scored 100% in chemistry and computers.
