AHMEDABAD :   and   (LGBTQ) activist,  , is set to form an   on   and Section 377 IPC for law students at Karnavati University. The proposal for creating the module was put forth by the  , Dr Deepak Shishoo, on Thursday, soon after Gohil addressed a lecture at the varsity.

 Talking to TOI, Gohil said, “The module will educate students about something that the education system avoids. Considering the fact that India reports the third-highest number of HIV positive cases in the world, lack of knowledge and sex education can be further detrimental to the spread of sexually transmitted infections.”
 
 Gohil added, “Issues around gender and sexuality often have taboos associated with them and bringing them to students on an academic forum will help broaden their outlook.”
 
 “Even as it was proposed on an open forum, I immediately agreed because social change can happen from an educational institute. If one institute takes the initiative, others will follow suit,” Gohil said.
 
 Highlighting the academic rationale behind the proposal, Dr Shishoo said, “The module will not merely talk about Section 377 of the IPC but rather include trivia on how the law came into force and the debate that followed after a Delhi High Court judgement as well as the Supreme Court judgement.” 
 
 “The idea is to make it an exhaustive module including how the law evolved and its impact in addition to other issues,” said Dr Shishoo. 
 
 Gohil mentioned his plans to set up a resource centre on his palace ground to facilitate medical care for mental, physical and sexual health of the LGBTQ communities in addition to skill development and training for the community.
