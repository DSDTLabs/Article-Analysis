Rana Daggubati, who plays a pivotal role in Sankalp Reddy’s 'The Ghazi Attack', has been deeply affected by the challenges faced by our defence personnel. The film, whose trailer has intrigued the audience, has been inspired by a classified mission conducted by the Indian   against their Pakistani counterpart in 1971, which not many people know about. It rekindles the mystery of what happened on the night of December 3 that year and what caused the sinking of the PNS Ghazi, Pakistan Navy’s first fast-attack submarine. The movie, that releases on February 17, has Rana playing Lieutenant Commander  , who is said to have remained underwater for 18 days during the war. While shooting for the film, he met many former Navy officers who were part of the mission. Rana was so moved on hearing about their challenges that he decided to write a letter to the President of India. In his letter, Rana has requested that our armed forces personnel be acknowledged, as the nation must know about these unsung heroes and their immense contribution.
