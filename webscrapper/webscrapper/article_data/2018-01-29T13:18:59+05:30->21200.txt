 Jyoti was part of Arshi Khan’s party, which she had thrown recently and what's more, the former has been staying at the latter's place since then.
 
 Vikas Gupta, Priyank Sharma, Akash Dadlani, Benafsha Soonawalla, Sabyasachi and Mehjabin Siddiqui were the other former Bigg Boss contestants who attended the said party.
  
  On a related note, Bigg Boss 11 winner Shilpa Shinde, who was also part of the guest list, was not found in attendance and this had set a lot of tongues wagging.
 
 Arshi had taken to her Twitter account to lend voice to her emotions. She had shared a cryptic message which ran as: “Har rishte me farz hota Hai jab kuch kiya jaaye to apne pehchaan wale ko bulaya jaaye r jb wo aaye to acche se istaqbaal kiya jaaye. Bulana mera farz. Aana unka farz. Ku ki ZAMEER nhi hilte yaha. ZAMEEN hil jaati hai,” she wrote.
