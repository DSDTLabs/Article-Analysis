MANGALURU: If you are a student securing a seat under the   in a  , then you must serve a three-year rural stint.

 Though the rule has been in existence for some time, there was no clarity until now. The   (KEA), which conducts entrance tests, has announced the mandatory three-year rural posting rule on its website and said candidates must serve in areas decided by the government. They must submit a bond to this effect at the time of admission to the college.
 
 KEA administrative officer SN Gangadharaiah told TOI: “Candidates who have received free admission under quota will have to serve in rural areas for five years.” To criticism that the rule was thrust on candidates without notice, the officer clarified that the rule has been in vogue for long and is part of the government’s admission policy.
 
 Sources said the government may strictly implement the rule from this academic year as it was facing an acute shortage of PG doctors in rural areas and governmentrun hospitals in the state.
 
 PG medical seat aspirants upset
 
 A similar rule exists for UG medical students under government quota where they serve in rural areas for one year. This is in accordance with the amendment to Rule 11 of the Karnataka Selection of Candidatesfor Admission to Government Seats in Professional Education Institutions Rules, 2006.
 
 However, postgraduate medical-seat aspirants aren’t happy. A student preparing for the entrance test told TOI: “When other states prescribe a one-year bond, why does Karnataka impose a three-year rule? Is it because they don’t want us to opt for government-quota seats?”
 
 Verdict on Monday: The Supreme Court, which has stayed the Karnataka government order making studying in the state for a minimum of 10 years mandatory to qualify for government seats in postgraduate medical courses, is likely to deliver its judgment on Monday.
