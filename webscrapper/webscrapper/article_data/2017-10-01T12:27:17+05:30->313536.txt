NAINITAL:  ,   in Haldwani-Kathgodam Municipal Corporation, who used film posters of blockbusters of 70s, 80s and 90s such as Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaenge, Sholay, Don, Coolie, Anand, Zanjeer, Deewar to deliver messages about cleanliness has been chosen for ‘Swachta Hi Seva’ award by Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. 

 Earlier, this year in April, a Twitter user sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attention on this, to which the PM tweeted, “Haha! Borrows from cinema to make a point on cleanliness. Innovative.”
 
 Adhikari, ecstatic over the development, told TOI: “I am feeling happy and proud. I am also delighted that the government recognized not only my effort, but also that of 19 others. I will continue working in the best interest of the people and keep spreading word in innovative ways about ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’.”
 
 In March, TOI had reported the innovative move. The officer had put up posters inspired by movies to motivate people into participating in ‘Swachh Bharat’ movement. Twitterati lauded the move. One user tweeted, “It is a good attraction for the Bollywood lovers. At least by this, they would keep our country clean.”
 
 The civic body had put up posters of blockbuster movies, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna, Pran, Nirupa Roy and others. The characters were prodding people to keep the city clean and renounce use of plastic bags.
 
 “The idea sprung up from the thought that people will pay more attention to anything which is interesting. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take notice of the initiative. It is like a lifetime achievement award to me. The praise has given us a huge morale boost and we will try to make our country clean,” Adhikari said.
