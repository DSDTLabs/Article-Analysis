GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Chamber of Commerce & Industry ( ) has approached   and Haryana high court, seeking a stay on the auction of the prime 11.76-acre plot in   to a   subsidiary, claiming the land was earmarked for a community centre and multi-level car park for entrepreneurs.

 The court has directed the state industries department and Haryana State Industrial & Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) to ascertain the petitioner’s claim by April 22. On February 27,   sold the plot in an auction for a record price of Rs 1,496 crore. Afterwards, industrialists alleged there was a proposal for the construction of a multi-level car park and community centre, whose foundation stone had been laid in 2004 by then chief minister  , but HSIIDC had failed to follow up on that afterwards to implement the project.
 
 The high court has observed that the writ petition involves “pure question of facts”, which can be determined by the authorities themselves, and disposed of it with a direction to HSIIDC and the industries secretary. 
 
 After the auction, an HSIIDC official said the multi-level car parking project had been shifted to a different plot in Phase 4, Udyog Vihar, though the project could not be started because of ongoing litigation. He added once the court case was settled, the construction of the multi-level car parking facility can begin.
 
 A DLF spokesperson said the company did not want to comment as the matter is subjudice.
