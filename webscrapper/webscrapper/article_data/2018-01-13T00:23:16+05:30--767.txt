Bhopal: Khushboo Khan, a promising hockey player, whose shanty was razed, is all set to get a new home. Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) team demolished the shanty of the player, who was part of the 33-member core group of the Indian women hockey team a couple of months ago.

 Speaking on sidelines of mass Surya Namaskaar at Lal Parade ground in Bhopal on Friday, Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Priyanka Das confirmed the move.
 
 She said a BMC team surveyed the area and found Khushboo eligible for a new house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).
 
 “Under Prime Ministers’s Awas Yojana, Khushboo is eligible to get a new house. Our team is on the job and out of our seven upcoming projects, she will definitely get a new house as per her choice and eligibility,” the BMC commissioner said.
 
 She said the hockey player would be shown few other properties, which are already built by BMC. “If she and her family like and select any of them, we will provide them the same and if she can wait a bit more, then we will be able to provide more choices to her,” she said.
 
 She admitted the family of Indian hockey team core group member Khusboo Khan faced eviction from her home which was a shanty where she and her family had lived for over17 years on the campus of the veterinary hospital at Jehangirabad.
 
 A few months ago, the shanty was bulldozed, but the hockey player would be soon rehabilitated to a pucca house which the BMC will try to give close to any stadium, Das said.
 
 Khusboo, 18, the daughter of an auto driver Shabir Khan, has come up the hard way. She has represented the state in national tournaments in senior, junior and sub-junior categories.
