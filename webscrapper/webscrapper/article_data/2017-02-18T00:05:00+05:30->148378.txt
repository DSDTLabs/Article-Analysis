 cinema has been making a lot of progress in recent times. The latest being the idea of making a crowd-funded film. And taking up this innovative method of filmmaking is director  , who is currently soaking in the success of his recent film 
 . Ask Sooraj what made him opt for this detour in spite of being backed by a hit film, he says that he couldn’t digest the conditions laid down by local producers. “They have umpteen demands, which as a director I find ridiculous. The rest have a genuine interest in making  , but don’t have the funds to back them,” he explains.
It was this dilemma that led Sooraj to think of gathering funds from the public and other film lovers to back his upcoming film. Titled 
 , the movie explores the nuances of languages – the use of English and Tulu in the local scenario. “English language has become a part of our daily conversation, so I wanted to explore this aspect and tell my audience to judiciously make use of the language and not just wipe out the local tongue,” observes the director. The film will star leading man Pruthvi Ambar as a villain for the first time. Other Tulu biggies including Naveen D Padil. Aravind Rai and Manju Rai will also star in the project. “I’ve already got an encouraging response from friends and other Tuluvas who are residing in Mumbai and the Middle East. Since I have a hit film behind me, they have reposed immense faith in me. The budget is about Rs 60 lakh, so I hope to gather that amount by April and go on the floors,” sums up Sooraj.
