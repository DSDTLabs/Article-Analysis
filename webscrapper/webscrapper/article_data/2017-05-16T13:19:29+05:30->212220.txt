VISAKHAPATNAM: Sector-10 of   under ward number 7 of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( ) has many civic issues which need to be addressed immediately.

 Residents point out that poor condition of the drainage system and blocked canals are the major civic issue of the the area which is close to Beach Road.
 
 “The drainage canal passing through our area is always blocked with plastic and solid waste. Sanitation officers hardly visit our area or clean it. The canal is the best example of how poorly the GVMC takes up maintenance works,” said P Parvathi, a resident of MVP Sector 10.
 
 Another resident  , a businessman, said the streetlights do not function in some areas. “There are snakes and other reptiles in the vast ground and bushes near Andhra University Student’s Hostel in the locality. Lack of proper lighting is a major impediment,” he said.
 
 “The bar in the area remains open beyond the scheduled time as there is no regulation by the excise and police personnel,” said a housewife Srilatha K.
 
 A senior GVMC officer said, “Most of sector is slum area where fishermen abide. Despite our sincere efforts in maintaining cleanliness, the condition of the area remains same, particularly in the rainy season. However, we will do our best to upgrade the area.”
