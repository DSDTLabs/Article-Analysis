MUMBAI: In an attempt to end “unhealthy“ competition between bus corporations in the neighbourhood and promote route and time sharing, BEST has made a unique proposal to the state--bring BEST as well as TMT and NMMT, the bus undertakings in Navi Mumbai, Thane and  , on a common service platform.

 Besides ensuring that there is no clash in services, the objectives include optimum utilization of buses, better frequency and availability of more buses during peak hours.
 
 “There should be an integration of services where the infrastructure can be shared between bus corporations and the bus routes and timings can be rationalized to ensure there is no clash,“ said BEST general manager Jagdish   after Thursday's committee meeting.
 
 He further said the proposal has been sent to the state and the BMC. Sources said the state has already swung into action, with the transport department holding a meeting to work out the modalities. “After all, the resources--the buses--come from public money. Why compete?“ said Patil, who is keen on improving the quality of bus services. For instance, he said, if a bus from Thane is leaving at a particular time in the morning, a BEST bus should adjust its timings in such a way that it operates only after the Thane bus has left.
 
 “This will ensure better frequency and reduce the waiting time for passengers,“ he said. At the same time, a BEST bus should be allowed to use the terminus or depot at Thane or Navi Mumbai and vice versa. Nearly 500 buses operate on 50 routes to Navi Mumbai and Thane.
