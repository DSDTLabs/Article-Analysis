 Marketing seems to be a popular domain with students. Unlike finance where the roles are fixed, marketing provides a wide range of opportunities to the students. Analytics, an integral part of sales and marketing, is among the recent domains that has been gaining significance. It is gaining popularity because it plays a major role regardless of what the industry is, said Abhishek Totawar, chairperson, placement and external relations at IIM Trichy.
 
 Amit Kumar Pandey, a first year PGP student said that he opted for general management in the summer placements to get exposure to other domains. Top recruiters opt for summer placements to recruit students. The recruiters give critical projects to students and based on the performance they are offered pre-placement interviews or pre-placement offers. Amit has been offered a management role in a reputed automobile company in the summer placements.
