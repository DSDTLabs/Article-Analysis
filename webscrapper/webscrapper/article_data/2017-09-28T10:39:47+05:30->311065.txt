PATNA: At least 26 of the Congress’ 27 MLAs skipped the function at which party’s newly appointed working president Kaukab Quadri assumed charge at the party’s state HQ at   in Patna on Wednesday. 

 While MLA Siddharth attended the function, at least 15 MLAs and MLCs visited ousted   president   at his residence at 2, Polo Road to express solidarity with him. “It would not be proper to reveal the name of MLAs who met Choudhary,” a close aide of the sacked party chief told TOI.
 
 Before assuming charge, Quadri called on Congress legislature party leader in assembly Sadanand   at his residence. “Quadri is like my younger brother. The party high command’s decision to appoint him as working president will be honoured. We will work together to expand the party’s base,” Singh said.
 
 Quadri later announced that the party would launch a massive agitation across the state against the multi-crore Srijan scam and bungling in the   pump canal scheme. He said he would organise agitations at block and district levels against “anti-people policies” of the Nitish Kumar government.
 
 Quadri appealed to the Congress leaders to sink their differences and strengthen the organisation. 
 
 Asked about the opposition of certain Congress legislators to alliance with RJD boss Lalu Prasad, Quadri said, “It is a policy matter on which the party’s central leadership will take a call.”
 
 To a question on Choudhary harping on his dalit background after his removal, Quadri said it was the same Congress which made him the party president and minister.
