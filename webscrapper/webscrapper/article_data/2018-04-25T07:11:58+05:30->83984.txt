HYDERABAD: ACB sleuths registered a criminal misconduct case against the suspended   director, K  , for forcing a real estate firm management to sell four plots in   for much below the market price. The accused official made a profit of 18.9 lakh. 

 ACB registered the case based on the complaint lodged by TP Reddy, representative of GRR Developers. The complainant alleged that in 2016, Purushotham Reddy who was the director (planning) of HMDA, demanded four plots of 1,266 square yards for a lesser price in a venture at Shankarpally to approve the layout permission.
 
 While the prevailing market price per square yard was 3,500, the accused official got the flour plots by paying only 2,000 per square yard, said an ACB official. 
 
 Purushotham Reddy paid 20 lakh in cash at his house in   to a firm representative. "As part of the deal, he was supposed to pay 25.3 lakh but he paid only 20 lakh in cash and got the real estate firm signed documents saying that the plots were sold to him. However, Purushotham Reddy did not get the plots registered in his name to keep the transaction concealed from agencies like ACB," said an investigating official. 
 
 The complainant also handed over 20 lakh paid by Reddy to ACB. The amount will be submitted to the court. 
 
  ACB court convicted K Anuradha, SI (Traffic), Hyderabad in a trap case registered in 2008. ACB caught Anuradha at the   of the CCS, taking a 5,000 bribe from the complainant to arrest the accused in a dowry harassment case. The court sentenced the accused to undergo two years rigorous imprisonment and pay a fine of 5,000 fine.
