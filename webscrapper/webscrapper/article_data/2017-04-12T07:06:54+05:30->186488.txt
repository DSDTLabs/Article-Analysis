 As most bikers involved in accidents were found not wearing helmets, RTO had recently made it mandatory for dealers to give helmets to new bike and scooter buyers. Also, those getting two-wheeler licence have to submit an affidavit before RTO that he will use a helmet while riding the vehicle. —Somit Sen
