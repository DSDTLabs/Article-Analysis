With the third installment in the ‘Race’ franchise all set to hit theatres this year in June, the cast and crew are in a hurry to complete the film on time. Starring  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   in important roles, ‘Race 3’ is directed by Remo D’Souza, and is touted to be among the biggest releases of 2018. 

 However, thanks to Salman’s recent legal woes, it seems the film’s schedule has gone slightly awry, leading the cast to reportedly work in double shifts. With the spotlight on Salman’s conviction, imprisonment and bail in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case, ‘Race 3’ has suffered a slight setback since the actor was out of action for several days. It is a known fact that a huge amount of money rides on Salman, so any delay causes stress to his producers. Another problem for the film is the fact that there was a sudden shift in the shoot locations. So, scenes which were initially supposed to be shot abroad, are now being shot in India, leading the crew scrambling to get everything in place on time. 
 Producer  , however, says that there is no truth in these rumours and that the schedule is on time and progressing well. Taurani says that the film has already completed its Abu Dhabi schedule and portions are now being shot in India. Fans, meanwhile, are hoping that the film releases on time.
