The exercise will continue till all unauthorized hoardings are removed," said an officer of BMC. The removed materials were taken in a truck to the BMC stockyard. 
 
 The move came two days after the BMC held discussions with representatives of all political parties to seek consensus on imposing restriction on putting up political posters in no-hoarding zones. At the meeting, the BMC officials informed them about heritage sites and routes that have been declared as no-hoarding zone. It was also decided that a format for applying for putting up posters would soon be created for political parties so that permission can be granted accordingly and public will also come to know which political parties will have posters at which locations.
 
 "The unauthorized posters not only lent an ugly look to the cityscape but also led to generation of lot of waste, which the civic body had to clean. The regulation will help clear the cityscape of the eyesore and maintain its aesthetic beauty. It will also restrain the parties, which earlier used any space for posters," said a BMC officer. 
 
 The representatives of the parties had also urged the BMC to take stringent action against those violating the no-hoarding norms irrespective of political affiliation.
