KOLKATA: The Freemasons' District Grand Lodge of Bengal recently   to dispel myths and throw some light on what actually goes on within the closed doors of the extremely secretive society.`Three Knocks', staged at  , tried to address questions about their practices.

 The name `Three Knocks' is itself very symbolic since it is a code that guides Freemasons about various stages that their meetings are in, the announcement of a brother's arrival and the degree of his initiation into the system. The knocks are either given by a wooden gavel, or through one's knuckles. The play, written by Amit Dutt, a Freemason, is a murder mystery that seeks to unfold and explain the “secrets“. 
 
 “We do have codes and passwords, but then even armies have them. Do we question them? Take the Rolls-Royce, for example. It has its own secrets about how to manufacture a dream car. Does the world question them for that?“ Dutt asked. “What the world knows as secrets are basically allegories.Yes, we do have some prayers in the dark but that should not be misconstrued. We are all in the dark as humans and are searching for the truth.... Freemasonry is about searching for this truth,“ he added.
 
 Perhaps the rituals with coffins, skulls and crossbones have caused the greatest disbelief among the common man about Freemasons. People have accused the secretive society of practising black magic.Dutt says: “There is nothing dark in whatever we do. We don't deny that we use skulls in our prayers, but those are also symbolic.“
 
 Through his murder mystery, Dutt has tried to explain the symbolism of the squares and compasses and that of the three knocks.
