KANPUR:   stadium pitch curator   has been transferred to   district. Sources said Kumar has been asked to report to the new station soon. Sports director   said it was routine affair and not related to the betting racket during the   match between Gujarat and Delhi recently.

 It might be noted that three bookies, including a former Mumbai-based cricketer, were arrested in the city during the match.
 
 During investigation, it came to light that the mastermind of a betting racket had claimed to be in touch with Shiv Kumar to know the nature of pitch. Kumar had dismissed the claims of Shah.
 
 Interestingly, Kumar had joined the sports directorate as an electrician but rose to become a pitch curator.
