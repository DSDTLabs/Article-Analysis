NAVI MUMBAI: A 23-year-old law student, whose husband had alleged that she was kidnapped by her parents residing in  , was reunited with him after she told the   on Wednesday that she wanted to return to him.

 Mankhurd resident   (28) had claimed that on December 17, when they were outside  , four men who came in an MUV assaulted him and abducted his wife,   (23), at the behest of his in-laws as they were opposed to their inter-community marriage.
 
 On Wednesday, Reshma appeared before a bench of justices BR Gavai and BP Colabawalla in the judge’s chamber. Advocate Hasnain Kazi, counsel for Choudhary, said, “Reshma accompanied by her cousin appeared before the judges. The judges asked her what her decision was: whether she wanted to stay with her parents or return to her husband. She replied that she wanted to return to her husband. Accordingly, the bench passed an order handing over Reshma’s custody to her husband.” 
 
 He further said, “The judges told us to get their marriage registered before the registrar of marriages at BKC on February 8 as they had only solemenized their nikaah.” The judges even waived off the one month period notice mandated for registration of marriage, he added.
 
 Following Choudhary’s complaint of kidnap, Navi Mumbai police had arrested two persons, one of them in Mangaluru. Choudhary had also filed a habeas corpus petition in the HC seeking directions to produce his wife. Last month, when Reshma was produced in court, she told the judges she had gone home of her own accord and that would like to stay with her parents for a while as her mother was unwell.
 
 Kazi added, “Reshma requested the HC bench to consider quashing the FIR lodged against her parents in connection with her kidnapping as she did not want her family members and relatives to be arrested. But we have sought time till February 16 as my client wants to talk to his wife to know whether she was forced by her parents not to go back to him.”
