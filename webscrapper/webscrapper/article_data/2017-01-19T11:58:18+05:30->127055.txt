VADODARA: Seven candidates are now in the fray for two seats of donor’s category of M S University’s senate body even as the   is heating up with each passing day. Elections for the two seats are scheduled on February 9.

 The scrutiny of nomination forms held on Wednesday witnessed intense drama as one time ‘guru shishya’ turned foes – professor Pragnesh Shah and Jigar Inamdar entered into heated arguments at the university head office. 
 
 Ahead of the scrutiny, Prataprao Bhoite, president of the  , who is one of the candidates backed by the ‘sankalan samiti’, had submitted objection to Inamdar’s nomination on the grounds that the latter had not submitted the mandatory no objection certificate (NOC) though he is drawing salary from Government of India as an officer in the   for Cultural Relations.
 
 Inamdar, on the other hand, argued that he is not an employee of the Central government and hence he does not require to submit a NOC. He argued that he has been appointed just as a consultant for a period of one year. 
 
 While arguments between Shah and Inamdar continued at the university head office for quite some time, the university considered all the seven nominations as valid under statute 158. 
 
 After scrutiny, nominations of Mayank Patel, Vrajesh Patel, Rahul Sandhu, Sangram Barot apart from Shah, Inamdar and Bhoite have been declared as valid. 
 
 While Bhoite and Vrajesh Patel are the official candidates of the ‘sankalan samiti’ which compromises of members of the BJP, RSS, ABVP and Maharaja Sayajirao Vishvavidyalay Shaikshik Sangh, Inamdar who was earlier served as government-nominated senate member is now fighting the poll battle as a rebellion along with Mayank Patel.
 
 The last date of withdrawal of nominations is January 24. There are nearly 130 voters in this category of elections but nearly 108 voters including individuals, institutions and corporates are expected to participate in the voting process.
