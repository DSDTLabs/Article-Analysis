KOLKATA: The   on Thursday stayed proceedings against   leader   — under Sections 182(b) and 211 of the IPC — for three months after his lawyers argued that no investigation had been carried out by police. 

 Majumdar was arrested on January 14 on charges of receiving money from some youths with promises to provide them teaching jobs.
 
 Majumdar’s counsel Bhaskar Sen and   had submitted in the HC that a police officer had met their client when he was an inmate at Dum Dum Correctional Home and urged him to pay Rs 10 lakh to the complainants. He also handed over a letter, purportedly written by the complainants, stating that they would withdraw the complaint on receipt of money. 
 
 On Thursday, Justice   stayed proceedings under the two sections and wanted to know why no FIRs had been lodged against Majumdar. He observed that it had to be examined whether an extortion case could be made out against the cop who allegedly visited Majumdar.
