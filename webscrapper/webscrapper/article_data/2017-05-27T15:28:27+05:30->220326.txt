RANCHI: Former Union home minister in the UPA cabinet   on Friday said there is a need for the   government to introspect over the Kashmir situation and India’s relationship with foreign nations. 

 The veteran Congress leader, who arrived from Delhi, to provide a ‘true picture of the Modi government’ who is celebrating its third anniversary in office, said Kashmir will be on the boil if the Centre did not initiate tripartite talks with Pakistan and separatists.
 
 “There was never a situation before where stones were pelted at the armed forces. During our time, such isolated incidents took place but were quickly brought under control,” Shinde told media persons at Congress’ Jharkhand headquarters here. The politician added, “Terrorist activities are increasing in the valley because Modiji is not engaging in dialogue. There should be a liaison between all those concerned.”
 
 Recollecting his visits to the state as home minister, Shinde said the Modi government had failed to tackle the rising Maoist menace. “The guidelines for anti-Maoist operation was not followed in Chattisgarh’s Sukma district. This is why so many jawans lost their lives in the Maoist encounter,” he said.
