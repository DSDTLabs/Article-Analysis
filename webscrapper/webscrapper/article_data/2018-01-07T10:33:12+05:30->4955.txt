COIMBATORE: While the   ( ) staff continued their strike for the third day on Saturday, authorities roped in drivers of school and college buses to operate 59% buses in the district. As many as 230 town buses and 83 mofussil buses, which were taken out of the 10 depots around 5am, were used to conduct services within the district and to neighbouring districts.

 Tnstc deputy manager (commercial) R   said that the department has taken adequate steps to operate all the buses and is hiring temporary drivers. “Tnstc Coimbatore region has 1,071 buses, including 723 town buses. The revenue generated from the Coimbatore region was Rs 1 crore a day. We have been facing a loss of Rs 50 lakh a day for the last two days. However, we managed to operate more buses in the districts by recruiting more than 100 temporary drivers to ensure smooth operations,” he told TOI.
 
 “Because of the trade unions strike, many people have postponed their travel plans. So, the number of passengers has come down. But, if the situation continues till the Pongal festival, Tnstc will have to bear losses amounting to cores of rupees,” a senior Tnstc official said.
 
 In Coimbatore city, the authorities managed to operate only 30% of the buses till 5pm. While 170 buses were operated, as many as 570 town and mofussil buses were parked at the eight depots in the city police limit.
