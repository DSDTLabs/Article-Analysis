CUTTACK/ANGUL: The mathematics question paper of the state board-organised matriculation examination went viral on social media within 45 minutes of the exam starting on Saturday. The news comes days after similar photographs of the   and English matric papers too were circulated on social media at different stages while the exams were being written. 

 With reports reaching that villagers in   received photographs of the maths question paper at around 9.45 pm on  , it is being alleged that an exam centre in Dhenkanal district is responsible behind the 'leak'. 
 
 Like the Odia and English papers, it is the objective section of the   that was allegedly leaked. Students have to answer the objective questions in the first hour of the exam, between 9 am and 10 am. They are then given a separate question-answer booklet to write on from 10 am to 11.30 am.
