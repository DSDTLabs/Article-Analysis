New Delhi: More than eight years after the then   government created  ,800 posts of talatis in  , the posts are still vacant. 

 The recruitment examination for talatis in 2014 was marred by mass irregularities and cancelled in 2015.
 
 The state government can now take fresh measures to fill these posts. The   has drawn the curtain on the litigation initiated by candidates by holding that the state was right in cancelling the recruitment examination because of large-scale malpractices.
 
 A total of 1,800 posts of revenue talati were created by the government on October 23, 2008. When Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board expressed inability to hold the recruitment examination within the time frame decided by the state, the revenue board of the government decided to undertake the recruitment process itself.
 
 IThe revenue boardâ€™s proposal was approved on December 4, 2013. On January 15, 2014, an advertisement was issued for filling 1,500 posts of talatis. 
 
 The examination was held across the state and 7.53 lakh candidates took the exam.
 
 A month later, police arrested two persons on the charge that they had taken money from candidates assuring them of appointment as talatis. 
 
 More complaints of irregularities poured in. The examination was cancelled July 3, 2015.
 
 Aspiring talatis challenged the cancellation. An SC bench of Justices J Chelameswar and A M   upheld the cancellation. 
 
 The judges said whenever large-scale irregularities mar a recruitment process, a state cannot be restrained from cancellation of the recruitment process on the basis of reasonable evidence indicating malpractices.
