PUNE: The   (NGT) bench here on Tuesday set a three-month deadline for the   to remove all construction debris from the Mutha river bed.

 Hearing an execution-cum-contempt petition filed by activist Sarang Yadvadkar and five others, the bench comprising Justice U D Salvi and expert member   also sought a list of encroachments and unauthorized structures within the blue flood line, and directed the PMC to undertake a massive tree plantation drive during the ongoing monsoon.
 
 The petition was in connection with the construction of a 24-metre wide road linking Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass at  , as part of which a 2.3-km stretch passes through the river bed.
 
 Civic authorities have to submit a progress report to the green tribunal after a month-and--half. Failure to implement the order will result in the municipal commissioner, civic chief engineer, superintendent and executive engineers paying environmental damages from their salaries, the bench warned.
 
 “We are happy that the NGT bench has come out with very specific and clear directives, and has fixed responsibility. The directives which come as a good precautionary measure from the viewpoint of people who often get affected by flooding due to heavy rains,” Yadvadkar told TOI. 
 
 An officer from the PMC’s law department, on the request of anonymity, said the directives pertains to the debris generated during the construction of the bypass road. The officer also confirmed receiving the directives pertaining to the plantation drive and submission of the list. 
 
 Lawyer Asim Sarode, who appeared for the petitioners, said, “The bench has posted the matter for hearing next on September 4 with regards to compliance of its directives.”
