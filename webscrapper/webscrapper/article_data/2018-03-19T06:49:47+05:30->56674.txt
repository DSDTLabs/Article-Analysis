JAIPUR: Government jobs are the most sought after, or so one believes. An RTI has revealed that more than 40% of   who cleared the examination for medical officers at government hospitals, did not join duty. According to the government’s reply on the RTI filed by one Nikita Jangid, the state government has announced recruitments for medical officers four times since September 2014.

 
 The state has requirement of 6,000 medical officers and is reeling under a shortage of 1,400. However, attempts to fill the posts seem futile. In 2016, the state government had selected doctors on 1,170 posts in 2016. Of these, 579 joined the duty while 591 chose not to. After a gap of two years, the health department this month announced recruitment of MBBS doctors on 894 posts. “We have advertised 894 posts for medical officers this month,” said Dr RS Chhipi, additional director (gazetted), health department.
  
 
 
 “Government is not giving posting to candidates on places of their choice. Also, basic amenities like electricity, water and facilities like security and education for their children are not being provided,” said Dr  , a public health management expert.
 
 
 He said that the biggest reason for not joining government job is that there is no certainty of getting pre-PG incentives because every year the government is redefining definition of remote and difficult areas. “The MBBS doctors posted in remote and difficult areas get incentive marks they secure in NEET pre-PG exams for getting admission in PG medical courses. If they get posting in community health centres and primary health centres which do not fall in remote and difficult areas, they would prefer not joining the posting,” said Bagria.
 
 
 Health officers are posted at primary health centres, community health centres to take care of patients. Also, they help the government in improving health indicators by encouraging immunization,  .
