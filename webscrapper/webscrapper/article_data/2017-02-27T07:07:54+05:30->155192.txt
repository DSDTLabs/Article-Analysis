 "Guruji wants to field his younger son Basant Soren in the Littipara by-election for his electoral debut, considering this to be the one of the safest seats for the JMM," a senior JMM functionary of Pakur district unit said. The JMM leader added that Murmu's first wife, Uniki Tudu, however, expressed her willingness to contest from her husband's seat, to ride the sympathy wave.

 "Under no circumstances will JVM (P) accept the candidature of Basant Soren as JMM nominee in Littipara assembly seat if Murmu's wife is denied a party ticket," Pintu Agrawal, central committee member of JMM, said.
