NOIDA: A day after TOI reported about the dwindling profits on most of the routes of   buses, commuters have called for a speedy launch of the mobile application proposed to monitor the timing and location of the bus service. An app for the   buses is also on cards.

 The proposed NMRC mobile application for the GPS-enabled bus service was to be launched in March last year. NMRC officials, however, say that the application will be launched in February. The app, once equipped, will update users on bus timings, e-wallet, route tracking service and bus stops, among other features.
 
 “The NMRC bus service is a very good service in comfort but residents hardly know about the timings and the nearest stoppages of the buses. Just like app-based cab services show the exact location of the cab, there should be a mechanism to know the exact timing and spot where the bus would reach. It is not difficult since the   are already installed with the global positioning system (GPS),” Avnish Kumar, a resident of Prateek Wisteria society said.
 
 Rohit Tyagi, vice-president,   (AOA), Mahagun Moderne, Sector 78 said that the app would notify the users about the nearest location of the bus. “If timing and location are known to a commuter, everyone would prefer to travel by the city bus rather than the autos,” he said.
 
 PK Bose, regional manager, UPSRTC and nodal officer for NMRC told TOI that the app has been stuck because the data was not being uploaded and was not showing the exact location of buses. 
 
 “The problem was defeating the very purpose of the app. However, the same has been resolved now and we are looking at launching the app in February,” he said.
 
 An app for the UPSRTC buses which will be accessible to all commuters in the entire state is also in the pipeline, he said.
 
 “The company responsible for the   is also making an app for the 12,000 UPSRTC buses That will happen in the coming months,” Bose said.
