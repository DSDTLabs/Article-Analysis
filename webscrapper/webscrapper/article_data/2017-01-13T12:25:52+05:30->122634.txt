SHILLONG: Militant-turned-lawmaker  , who was arrested on last Saturday for raping a minor, has admitted his involvement in the crime against the 14-year old before the investigation team. "He (Dorphang) has admitted to sexually assaulting her. He is co-operating with the investigators," said Vivek Syiem, East Khasi Hills district SP (city). 

 The Independent legislator from Mawhati was remanded in five days' police custody soon after he was arrested from an inter-state bus terminus (ISBT) at Gorchuk in Guwahati.
 
  Dorphang was produced in a city court as his police custody ended on Thursday. The court remanded him in judicial custody for another 14 days. At least two cases have been registered against the lawmaker, who is a former chairman and co-founder of the Khasi militant outfit, Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), for his alleged involvement in the rape. 
 
 The sex racket came to light after an employee of a city guest house, owned by a senior Congress leader and state home minister HDR Lyngdoh's son was arrested for trafficking the victim last month.
 
 The girl, who hails from Ichamati was rescued near the guest house and was brought to the police station where she named all those involved in the crime.
 
  Altogether nine people, including Dorphang, as of now have been arrested so far in this case, based on the FIRs filed by the   (SCPCR). Meanwhile, the state police said more arrests are likely to follow .
 
 Women's organizations held a public rally on Wednesday demanding that chief minister Mukul Sangma should sack home minister HDR Lyngdoh, whose son's guest house in Shillong was allegedly used for sexually abusing the minor girl. The activists also demanded that all guest houses and hotels named by the victim should be shut down immediately. Other demands that were placed before the CM included setting up of fast track courts in all districts to ensure speedy and time bound justice to victims of violence and trafficking.
