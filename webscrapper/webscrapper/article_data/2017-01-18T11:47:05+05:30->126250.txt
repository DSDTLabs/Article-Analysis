KOLKATA: In a surprise move, India's top female player   has withdrawn from the  , to be held in Tehran from February 10 to March 5.

 Humpy, however, has not given any official reason for withdrawing from the meet. Her father   confirmed Humpy's withdrawal, but refused to disclose the reason behind the move. Humpy's withdrawal left only two Indians - GM D Harika and Woman GM Padmini Rout - in the fray.
 
 Reigning women's world champion China's Hou Yifan is also skipping the meet as she is not happy with the format. The 2015 world champion Ukrainian GM Mariya Muzychuk and current US women's champion   have decided to stay away in protest against the mandatory donning of headscarf as laws in Iran require women to cover their head. The headscarf issue has been widely criticized, but all the Indian players had initially said they have no problem with that.
