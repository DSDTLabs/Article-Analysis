 
 We have 14 members more than   in Karnataka. In  , with just one MLA above the majority mark, Congress completed five years in power. Here at the Centre, there were three MPs fewer (during the   government) than the magic number, but we continued and managed for five years. So, it is not the question of how many MLAs we have, it is a question of commitment. We are committed to democracy. 
 
 
 
 Both the parties are wise enough and the high command is there to guide us. Our high command has taken a wise decision in installing this government. Our aim is to safeguard the interests of the people and of democracy. 
 
 
 
 In coalition governments, problems will always be there. But we have joined hands on the principle of uniting all secular forces to keep the communal forces away from power. It is the desire and will of the people that we have implemented, particularly to save democracy and the Constitution. We are together, there is nothing to be worried about. Even the NDA government is a coalition. Congress-JD(S) will show the results. In the interest of the state and the country, sometimes we have to forget the past. BJP is trying to destroy democracy and institutions. We have to work together.
 
 
 
 Congress’s main objective is to keep BJP, backed by RSS, away from power. We want good governance, development. Law and order should be maintained, there should not be any polarisation in the name of Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikhs. People want peace. We will ensure that. Also, we have to look at 2019 Lok Sabha elections. If all secular parties don’t come together, it is difficult to stop the RSS-BJP from taking the reins of the country. 
 
 
 
 Naturally. We will create a programme of governance by finding common points from the two manifestos of JD(S) and Congress. 
 
 
 
 This is not the time to analyse all those things. After the vote of confidence in the assembly, when the leadership calls a meeting on election results, we will discuss it.
