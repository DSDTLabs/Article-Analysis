BHUBANESWAR: When   was taking oath as chief minister for the fourth time here on May 21, 2014, two   and   had skipped the ceremony at Raj Bhawan. 

 Maheswar had then gone on record saying he was upset after being dropped from the ministry and did not accompany Naveen to the   the same day. On Sunday, he and Patro were on cloud nine after staging a comeback.
 
 After governor S C Jamir administered the oath to the duo on Sunday, Maheswar and Patro were seen hugging each other, colleagues and supporters. 
 
 "I thank chief minister Naveen Patnaik for taking me back in his cabinet," said Maheswar, who avoided queries on the reasons for his expulsion from the ministry in 2014. Mohanty has got revenue portfolio. 
 
 In 2008, the BJD was left red-faced in the wake of the much-talked about assembly sex scandal surrounding Maheswar, who was then the speaker. In the third week of March 2008, a lady assistant marshal of the assembly accused Maheswar of harassing her sexually. Amid a massive public outcry and mounting pressure from the opposition Congress, Maheswar had to step down on March 31, 2008.
 
 Mohanty was in the thick of a controversy when some armed miscreants opened fire on him in Puri in February 2014 and hit him on his head at Chandanpur near Puri in January 2012. Maheswar, who was then the tourism minister, had suffered serious injuries. He faces fresh allegations of land grab around Swargadwar in Puri and Nabakalebara mismanagement. 
 
 Patro, who had been holding different portfolios since 1990, was seemingly so upset after being axed from Naveen's ministry in 2012 that he did not attend the CM's oath-taking function in 2014.
