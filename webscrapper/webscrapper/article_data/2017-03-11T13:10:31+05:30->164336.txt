 HUBBALLI: With many villages in Dharwad district facing acute drinking water shortage, the zilla parishat has come to the rescue of farmers by setting up helplines at each taluk. 
 
 Water crisis is severe in 13 villages of   taluk and five villages of Hubballi taluk. People of Mullolli, Yerinarayanapura, Rottigawada, Yereguppi, Kodliwad, Konkankurahatti, Gudenanatti, Hirenarti, Shirur, Kamadolli, Hosalli, Chakalabbi and other villages in Kundagol taluk and people of Shiraguppi, Bandiwad, Manturk, Nagaralli and Kusugal of Hubbali taluk are depending on water supplied through tankers to meet their daily requirement. Similar is the situation is in other taluks of the district. In many villages, borewells have become defunct forcing people to trudge miles to collect water. The district administration is also making use of private borewells to supply water to parched villages. 
 
 There have been complaints by the villagers that officials are not visiting their villages to understand the gravity of the situation. “When we meet officials they assure us that they will address our problems.
