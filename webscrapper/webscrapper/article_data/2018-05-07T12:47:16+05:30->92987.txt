LUCKNOW:  , the doctor and an accused in the deaths of children at the   in Gorakhpur, said on Sunday that he had no regrets for his efforts in saving the kids in August last year. He was released on bail recently after spending eight months in   jail. 

 The doctor said that if given a choice he would like to return to the hospital and do his best to save children in the encephalitis ward. "Whatever I did - from the night of August 10 till August 12, and all the efforts the staff put in to save the children, like getting oxygen cylinders from wherever possible - and if I had a choice I would still do the same things. I have no regrets, because I did what humanity calls for, and what anyone would have done, as a father, as a doctor, and as a human being," he told TOI. 
 
 Recalling the incident, where 30 kids died within 48 hours at the BRD hospital's encephalitis ward, Dr Khan said, "Children were dying every hour, and by then parents knew that oxygen supply to the hospital was disrupted. There were over 1,000 angry parents who were ready to attack us. Even if a similar situation arises, I'm willing to stay back and help like I did in August."
 
 He was speaking at a seminar on ' ' in Lucknow.
 
 Dr Khan said that he and eight others accused in the case were made scapegoats to hide the administrative failures. "Those culprits who failed to pay for the budget of the oxygen supply and the system that failed the children, were saved whereas nine of us were made the scapegoats. I don't know if my religion was the primary reason for my imprisonment," he said.
