 CHANDIGARH: With a motto to instill practical knowledge in the process of learning,   provided the students with the opportunity of a telescope making workshop, which concluded with an ‘Exhibition of Telescopes’ at  , Sector 27B, Chandigarh on Thursday. The exhibition was conducted to showcase the 10-day hard work that the students had put in during the workshop.
 
 The workshop commenced on May 2 and the students who participated were organized into 5 groups thus creating 5 well-functioning telescopes at the end of the workshop. The telescopes were made by the students themselves under the mentorship of  , a telescope expert from Inter University Centrefor Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. All of the tasks including grinding, polishing, assembling and painting thetelescopes were done by the students.
 
 The confidence with which the students briefed the process of making and functioning of the telescopes showed that they were mentored well and understood the concept in depth. Siddhant Kapoor, a class VIII student began by explaining the type of telescope they had made, “We have made a Newtonian telescope which enables us to see stars and planets like Saturn, Jupiter etc.”
 
 Arpit Narang, a class IX student said, “We grinded the lens using   (SiC). This process converts plane mirrors into concave or convex mirrors. This process was followed by polishing with Ferric Oxide. We also adjusted the focal length to 36 inches.” These children knew intricate details of each and every term thatthey used and answered all questions correctly with precision. Tushar Purohit talked about the material used to make the telescope. He said, “We have used items like table top glass and grinded them to make mirrors. The telescope tube is madeof PVC pipeswhichthe students have painted.”
