PUNE: The Hadapsar police launched an investigation on Wednesday to arrest a heavy-vehicle driver for   his 10-year-old daughter at their residence on Tuesday around 11.45am. 

 The girl is studying in the fourth standard of a Marathi medium school. Her mother works as a domestic help.
 
 Hadapsar police sub inspector   said, “The driver, his daughter and son were present at home while his wife had gone to a neighbouring house for work. The suspect instructed his son to go and play outside the house. He then caught hold of his daughter and started misbehaving with her, following which she raised an alarm.” 
 
 She said, “The suspect panicked and freed his daughter who opened the door and rushed out of the house. The terrified girl went to the house where her 33-year-old mother was working. She picked up her courage and told her mother about the acts committed by her father.”
 
 In the meanwhile, the suspect fled from his house after the neighbours rushed there on hearing the girl’s cries for help. 
 
 “The girl’s mother went home to seek an explanation from her husband, but he did not return home till late in the evening. The woman then decided to register a complaint against her husband under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection to Children from Sexual Offences Act,” she added.
 
 A police team has launched a hunt to arrest the suspect.
