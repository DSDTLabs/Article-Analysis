DHARAMSHALA: A team of police personnel and local trekkers on Sunday rescued a trekker who had fallen into a gorge on the Triund trek near here. 

  SP   said that Ankit   (33), a resident of Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and an assistant professor at   was trekking solo to Triund top. 
 
 On his return Paliwal slipped on a narrow curve and fell into a gorge. Locals informed the police after he called for help. "A team comprising police personnel and local trekkers was dispatched to the spot immediately, which pulled him out," said Patial. He sustained minor injuries and was given first aid at a local health centre. 
 
 The 8-km trek is considered moderate but is dangerous for solo trekkers and first timers, given the fact that around 12 persons have lost their lives on the trek in the last 10 years.
