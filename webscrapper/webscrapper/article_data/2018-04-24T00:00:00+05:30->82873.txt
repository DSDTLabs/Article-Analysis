Ever since director Anand Shankar announced his next,  , with   fame   in the lead, there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the project. Now, the news is that after Mehreen Pirzada, Chennai model   has joined the cast. The model-cum-actress, who shot to fame with Balaji Mohan’s As I Am Suffering From Kadhal (AISFK), will be playing an important role in this political thriller. 

 Says Sanchana, “I went to audition for a role, but was told later that I had auditioned for the wrong role. One of his assistants had informed me this and asked me to meet the director. When I met Anand sir, he told me that the role he had me in mind for, is a different one, albeit an important one, which has good screen space. When I heard the narration, I loved it. We were supposed to start shooting earlier, but there was a delay because of the strike. We have begun shooting for the film now.” Though she doesn’t want to reveal much about her role,   says that she will be sharing screen space with Vijay. “Who doesn’t like Vijay after Arjun Reddy? I met him on the very first day itself, on the set, and he seems to be a chilled out person,” she says. 
 
 Ask her if the offers have increased post the success of AISFK, and she says, “Oh, yes. That was a big break for me. I have been getting a lot of offers, and I have been auditioning for a few roles, too. I want to take my acting career as it comes. I am not hung up on playing only lead roles. If there is a solid character, which is crucial to the film’s plot, I am game. My role should be able to connect with the audience.” Sanchana will also be seen in Rajinikanth’s 2.0.
