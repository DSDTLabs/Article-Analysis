PANAJI: A lot of negativity is creeping into Goa today because of some self-styled leaders posing as public advisers and guides, and, along with current MLAs, former legislators should also step in to bring in the much-needed positivity, said speaker Pramod  , on Tuesday. He was addressing current and former MLAs at the state secretariat on the occasion of Goa Legislators’ Day.

 “There is a need for positivity in Goa and only we can bring it. Today, some self-styled leaders are emerging in Goa, who think they are guiding the people. Why should that happen when we are still around to guide the people. We need to mould society,” Sawant said.
 
 The assembly speaker said that all former legislators, irrespective of party lines, should also appreciate the government when it is moving in the right direction. They should also point out flaws to the government when required, he added.
