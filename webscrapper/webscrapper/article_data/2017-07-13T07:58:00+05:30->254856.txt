There is no information about Abhishek Kharbanda, the 22-year-old youth from Chandigarh who had gone missing from Shrikhand Yatra since July 3. Police and local search teams are combing the region to get some clues about him. The state government authorities had also tried to search him by helicopter but inclement weather conditions are not allowing helicopter to operate sortie. The government chopper, which had reached Mandi on Sunday, could not land in Kullu due poor visibility. The ground teams are searching for him since July 6.
