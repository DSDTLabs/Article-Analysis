 "Those speaking in favour of the Rohingya staying in India are simply politicizing the issue by giving it a religious tone. This problem is between Myanmar and Bangladesh. India has no stake in it. I praise   for the manner in which she has taken up the issue with the Myanmar government in order to find a solution," Prasad said here while addressing the media.
 
 It is the   of the government to deport  , the Union law minister said.
