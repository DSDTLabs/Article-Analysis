BENGALURU: Copying in an exam can now have a student debarred from writing one for up to three years. Sending a stern message to students, the   (Amendment)   2017, piloted by primary and secondary education minister  , was passed in the legislative council on Friday. Seen as a gamechanger, the Bill seeks to hike the quantum of punishment for examrelated malpractices.

 The bill was passed amid opposi tion from members of the BJP and JDS, who contended that the threeyear ban on a student caught copying was too harsh and would destroy the latter's academic career.
 
 BJP's   and JDS's   demanded that the state government reduce the ban to a single semester instead of three years. The opposition members also said the bill sought to target teachers as it prescribed punishment for question paper leaks and refusal to report for evaluation of answer scripts.
 
 Defending the bill, Sait said, “It's wrong to say that the bill has been brought intentionally to target teachers. We want to check malpractices in exams and will target only those who are guilty. The provision makes a student caught copying liable for punishment of up to three years and will deter them from resorting to unfair means.“
