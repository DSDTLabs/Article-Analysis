LUCKNOW: A wheelchair that can sense what is to be done through hand movements was the centre of much attention at  . Innovated by Arjit Tyagi, a BTech student of PSIT Kanpur, the wheelchair aims to make life easier for the differently able. “The aim was to develop something which could make the handicapped independent,” said Arjit. Another innovation was an app based   to track people in danger. The app will help people at risk of crime. 

 “We are focusing more on ‘were she/he is?’ rather than ‘where we are’ said app developer Alok Maurya of Dr M C   of Colleges. The passageway towards the auditorium had displayed 14 innovations from various AKTU-affiliated colleges. These included a spy camera, a bike with an air turbine engine and a solar-powered electric vehicle which could cover 130km at 40km/hr.
