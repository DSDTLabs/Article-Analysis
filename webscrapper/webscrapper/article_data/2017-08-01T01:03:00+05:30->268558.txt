Salem: Wild and Nature Conservation Trust (WNCT), an NGO, has lodged a complaint with the chief wildlife warden of Tamil Nadu forest department against ‘Zee’ TV channel authorities for showing two rose-ringed parakeets in one of their serials.

 One of the trustees of WNCT S Sharavanan told TOI that the rose-ringed parakeets come under the Schedule 4 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. “We have to protect the bird by all means,” he said.
 
 Sharavanan said the parakeets were featured in a daily serial ‘Yaradi Nee Mohini’ in   at 8.30pm on July 25. The birds were shown in the entire episode with a woman who acted as a fortune-teller. “Both the birds were used by violating WPA rules and regulations,” he added. 
 
 WNCT urged the chief wildlife warden to initiate stern action against the TV channel by invoking sections 9, 39, 50, 51 of the WPA, 1972.
