TIRUPUR: CPI and   cadres on Thursday petitioned the   deputy superintendent of police, P  , seeking action against a policeman who allegedly threatened them in an inebriated state a few days ago.

 “He was in plain clothes. When we questioned him, he said he was a police head constable with the   police station. He was in an inebriated state and he threatened us,” the Left cadres said, seeking action against him.
 
 A police source said the policeman was not presently working with the Perumanallur police station and he has been transferred to a special wing.
 
 The   has promised the petitioners to take appropriate action.
