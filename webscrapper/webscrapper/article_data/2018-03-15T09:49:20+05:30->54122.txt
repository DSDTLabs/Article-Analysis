CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) are putting paver blocks on the area along the V6 road in   where the residents used to park their vehicles at night. During a visit to various areas in the sector, it was found that a concrete area is being developed along the row of houses, whose residents are complaining that the authorities should leave part vacant so that water can seep in which is required for improving the ground water level.

 Sachin Sharma, a resident of the Sector 21, said he has raised the issue with the authorities and the area councillors, as it has become the issue of concern that such a concrete area is being developed all over the sector, which is not serving any purpose to the residents. He said the authorities should consult the residents before implementing such measures in any sector.
 
 Residents also complained that they have spent a lot to beautify the surroundings of their houses and now, the authorities are erasing those efforts by imposing their policy, which they have drafted without consulting the local people. They demanded that the authorities should re-think about these measures for the betterment of the residents.
 
 In the dock:
 
 The municipal corporation has made a policy that paver blocks will be installed on V6   for the convenience of public. The height of the paver blocks is such that the residents can easily park their vehicles on them at night. I have also asked the officials to look into cases where the residents have beautified the front-side of their houses and grant them exemptions, only if policy permits.
