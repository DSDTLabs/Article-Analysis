The driver of an  , who has worked in many South Indian films, including  , was arrested on Saturday morning in Kochi for conspiring and kidnapping her, and allegedly sexually assaulting her, along with a few other men on Friday night. 

 Learning about the incident made   angry, who said that the men who did this to her should be killed. "Only a woman can understand what she must have gone through. If it is true that the actress was sexually assaulted, and if that is proven, then the accused should be killed for putting a person through this. They should be shot. By committing such an act, they have shown that they don’t even respect their mother — a woman to who they were born. This isn’t just about the actress, but about every woman. Taking advantage of a woman’s physical weakness is not being a man. Men throughout history have taken a stand, which is why they are deserving to be called men. I am very angry right now. As men, we don’t know what a woman goes through in such times, but we can and must try to understand her pain."
