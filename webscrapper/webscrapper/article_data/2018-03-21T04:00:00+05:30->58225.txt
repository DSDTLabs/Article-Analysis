Surat: Police recovered six synthetic diamonds from office of Arvind alias Arjun Pandey at Princess Plaza in Mini Bazaar diamond market area of Varachha on Tuesday. They have begun Pandey’s questioning in this regard. Police also found one real diamond from the same office.

 Pandey was taken to his office on Monday and during examination cops recovered 10 small paper pouches similar to the ones used by diamond traders to pack diamonds. Of the 10 pouches, three were empty, while seven had one diamond each. Of the recovered diamonds, only one diamond was found to be real. 
 
 On verification it was found that six diamonds were fake.
 
 “We are hoping to recover some diamonds from Pandey’s office since he has been involved in some diamond loots in past. But recovery of fake diamonds has left us shocked. We are yet to find out why the accused had kept the fake diamond with him,” a police officer said.
 
 Police are questioning Pandey to find out if he was trading in synthetic diamonds. They are also exploring possibility that Pandey found the fake diamond in some loot. Further questioning of Pandey will reveal if he was running a racket to cheat other diamond traders by selling them synthetic diamond claiming it to be real.
