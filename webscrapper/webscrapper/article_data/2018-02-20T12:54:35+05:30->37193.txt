ALLAHABAD: The education board of the state, Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board ( ), has decided to debar for a period of 15 years all those examination centres from where 'serious malpractices' have been reported in the ongoing Class X and XII exams. 

 As per norms, centres are blacklisted for three years for malpractices. Apart from it, the evaluation of Class X and XII exam answer sheets will also take place under   surveillance. 
 
 The step has been taken after many principal-cum-centre superintendents were caught by the   on charges of conniving with solvers' gang to facilitate mass copying in Allahabad, Chandauli, Varanasi, Kaushambi, Meerut among others. 
 
 They were found working in tandem with copying mafia to dictate answers to the examinees of both class X and XII exams. Secretary, UP Board,  , said: "This year the state government has adopted every means to put a curb on mass copying and keeping copy mafia at bay from the examination process." "We have completely revamped the procedure of conducting the Board exams. Despite this, incidents of principal-cum-managers of schools conniving with copying mafia is not stopping. Hence, it has been proposed to blacklist such schools for a period of 15 years," she said. As part of the process, officials are compiling a list of all such centres where cases of irregularities have surfaced. The list of such centres will be placed before a committee which would select the schools to be debarred for a period of 15 years. The secretary said, "Out of the total centres, we have planned to debar only such centres whose superintendents and invigilators were found to be involved in fraudulent means to facilitate cheating." The proposal will be sent to the state government for approval.
