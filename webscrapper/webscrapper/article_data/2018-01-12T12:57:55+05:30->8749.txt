KOCHI: The signs were all too ominous, but migration experts have now confirmed it: remittances into Kerala are bound to come down over the next few years.

 It is estimated that the state receives annual remittances amounting to Rs 90,000 crore, which is 35% of the state’s income.
 
 For long, Kerala had been riding the tiger called remittances which not only sustained state’s economy but even gave a boost to the economic activity of the state, in terms of increased consumer spending and boom in construction sector.
 
 But experts warn that there will be a definite 5-10% decrease in remittances this year mainly due to the decrease in the outflow of migrants to other countries.
 
 “The decline is due to the fact that the population here is ageing and the state has relatively younger work force as compared to decade ago,’’ said Irudaya Rajan S, migration studies expert and professor, Centre for Development Studies. There are currently around 2.2 million non-resident Keralites.
 
 According to a   report the remittances to the South Asian region declined by 6.4% in 2016.
 
 The report said that ‘nationalisation’ policies aimed at mitigating unemployment rate of nationals have slowed employment opportunities and it has adversely affected remittance to many countries in   including India.
 
 Irudayarjan points out that the social and political atmosphere in the   countries, dip in oil prices and   issue have made it tougher for emigrants to get employment. “There is a two digit unemployment rate in some of these countries and they are feeling the pinch now,’’ he said.
