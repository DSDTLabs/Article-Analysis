NEW DELHI: The government is set to clear the air on taxing angel investor funding of startups and is expected to specify a threshold up to which investment in identified companies will not face  , even if it is above the fair market value, a senior government official said. The issue will address concerns as tax authorities have been issuing notices on investments above the market value, since a premium can be added to the income of a company.

 
 The move is part of the latest policy boost for startups and a notification specifying the details will be issued soon, industrial policy and promotion secretary   told reporters. Experts, however, suggested that a comprehensive solution is needed. "The issue of taxing the excess premium received by companies needs a complete solution. Carving one exception at a time, and that too with several riders, only adds to complexity and creates a further non-level playing field between Indian and foreign investors," said  , a partner at consulting firm  .
 
 The industry secretary said the government was keen to address all concerns and was pushing states to put in place a favourable regime for startups. Several initiatives, including a ranking of states on various parameters, were being undertaken.
 
 The government has recognised 8,765 startups, with 88 eligible for benefits, such as tax exemption on profits made during three of seven years of operations. Abhishek said initial estimates from around 7,000 startups indicate that over 81,000 jobs will be generated with a bulk of them being in the IT services space. Among the startups recognised by the government for various incentives, Maharashtra has seen maximum number, followed by Karnataka and Delhi. He said state rankings would be on the basis of initiatives taken to develop startup ecosystem. The ranking framework covers seven areas of intervention and 38 action points, including policy support, incubation centres, seed funding, angel and venture funding.
