PATNA: The state health department on Wednesday released a revised essential drug list (EDL) which saw the number of medicines go up to 310 from 145 in the previous list prepared in 2011.

 The new EDL envisages free distribution of 310 types of drugs and 42 kinds of medical devices to patients visiting government hospitals from June this year. For its revision, a technical core committee was set up that consulted principals, superintendents and specialist doctors of medical college hospitals in  . 
 
 “It was found that ophthalmological drugs and those meant for diabetes were not being provided to patients as per the previous EDL at the   and the Rajendra Nagar Eye Hospital. The same was the case with cancer drugs. These have, however, been included in the revised list,” state health minister Mangal Pandey said while addressing an event organized for the release of the revised list in Patna.
 
 Antihemophilic factor drugs will also be given for free at all medical colleges and hospitals as well as at the Gardiner Road Hospital. “The government is trying to convert the existing health sub-centres into wellness centres where better treatment facilities will be provided,” the health minister said.
 
 According to state health society’s administrative officer and drug procurement officer Khalid Arshad, the medicines, which will be supplied to the outpatient department (OPD), will also be utilized for patients in the inpatient department (IPD). However, a proper register will have to be maintained in the drug repository.
