It was a pleasant Sunday morning — the sun was well below the horizon and a nippy breeze was sweeping across Tank Bund, when thousands of Hyderabadis gathered at People’s Plaza, Necklace Road at 5:30 am to participate in the annual ‘SHE Teams Run’. Organised by Hyderabad Police’s SHE Teams to mark the upcoming Women’s Day on March 8, the theme of this year’s run was to ensure safety of women and children in the city and make Hyderabad a crime-free metro. 

 “Women’s safety is the top priority of the Telangana government and  . And since 2014, the SHE Teams have worked relentlessly to keep up with it. Thanks to their efforts, Hyderabad today is rated as the safest city among all the metros in India,” said K Mahender Reddy, Director General of Police. Badminton ace   and   actor   flagged off the run that had three categories — 2K, 5K and 10 K. Speaking on the occasion, Sindhu said, “Previously, women were afraid to step out of their homes at night, but after the inception of SHE Teams, I have seen a massive change. I want to thank the SHE Teams for all the good work they have done.”
 
 Praising the efforts of the women’s protection squad, Vijay said, “Hyderabad is the number one city to live in India and one of the biggest reasons for that is because women feel safe and secure here.”
 After an hour-long warm-up session that saw participants dance to foot-tapping numbers imitating professional dancers on a stage, the run finally kicked off at 6:20 am. And a sea of blue t-shirt-wearing people blanketed the Necklace Road. “I am participating in the run for the first time and trying to finish at least the 2k run,” said Bharathi, a private company employee.
 Another participant, Deeksha, a student of St Ann’s college, said that of all the things, she is excited to see celebrities like Sindhu and Vijay. “It is a good initiative from the SHE Teams in-charge Swati Lakra. I am thrilled to be around so many eminent personalities,” she averred.
