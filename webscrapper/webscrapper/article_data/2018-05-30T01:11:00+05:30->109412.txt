NEW DELHI: In the wake of the controversy surrounding the “semi-naming” of the IIT   station of Magenta Line as FIITJEE-IIT station by the   and IIT-Delhi approaching Delhi high court opposing the same,   has pasted a disclaimer outside the entry and exit   of the station.

 As part of co-branding of stations by DMRC, the entity to which naming rights are auctioned is given the right to carry out branding of entry and exit gates and also inside the station. IIT-Delhi has opposed the move of giving the naming rights of   metro station to FIITJEE, a coaching institute, as it says that it gives a misleading impression that the institute is in some kind of partnership with the coaching centre. IIT-Delhi wants   to either revoke the permission granted to FIITJEE, or remove the name of an upcoming metro station at the Safdarjung Development Area.
 
 FIITJEE has now pasted wide stickers where it says in bold letters that FIITJEE is in no way connected with any IIT in the country. The stickers appear right below the brand name of the coaching institute on a yellow background at all entry and exit gates of the station. A FIITJEE spokesperson refused to comment on the move.
 
 “We had advised the concessionaire to put up disclaimers at the station,” a DMRC spokesperson said. IITs hold and conduct the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for which the private study centre, FIITJEE, provides coaching. The premier engineering institution’s contention is that the naming of IIT metro station as FIITJEE has made many alumni and aspiring candidates believe that the institute has endorsed FIITJEE as an official coaching partner.
