PILIBHIT: A close aide to Union minister  , Swami Pravaktanand, who had rebelled against BJP leadership after he was refused a party ticket from Barkhera assembly seat, filed his nomination on Saturday on the symbol of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).

He claimed his political rival and sitting SP MLA from Barkhera assembly seat, Hemraj Verma, had clandestinely financed a weak candidate, Kishan Lal Rajput, to contest on a BJP ticket from Barkhera so that his electoral run was hurdle free.
  
  On the presence of many close aides of Gandhi during his nomination, Swami said he excellent personal relations with Gandhi as well as her team. He however kept quiet over issue of active support of Gandhi’s team despite his shift to RLD.
