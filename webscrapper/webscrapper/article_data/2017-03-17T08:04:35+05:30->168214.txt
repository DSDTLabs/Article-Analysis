GANDHINAGAR: The state assembly witnessed noisy scenes when   alleged that the state government had failed to improve   in Rajkot city. In the past one year, the city had registered a 50% rise in murders and 43% in rapes.

 The matter was raised by Rajyaguru during the discussion on law and order in Rajkot city. The Congress MLA said that as compared to 2015, there was an increase of 75% in dacoities, 53% in loots, 50% in murders and 43% in rapes.
 
 Later Rajyaguru told journalists outside the assembly that the law and order situation in Gujarat has been deteriorating. 
 
 “I just want to draw the attention of the government to the fact that the police had caught wanted criminals even from the election office of chief minister Vijay Rupani and this is on record,” Rajyaguru said. “The incident has been reported and it took place when Rupani was contesting the by-election after Vajubhai Vala resigned.”
 
 He said that the law and order in Rakot city had deteriorated beyond control. Rajyaguru further alleged that this had happened because the government has gone in for political appointments as chief minister Vijay Rupani hails from the city. During the discussion inside the house, minister of state for home   said that the population of Rajkot was increasing and there was tremendous industrial development in the city and nearby areas. 
 
 After this there was hue and cry in the assembly as   members demanded an apology. But Congress legislators refused to apologize. Speaker Ramanlal Vora repeatedly asked Rajyaguru to apologize, but when he refused, speaker expunged the remarks from the records.
