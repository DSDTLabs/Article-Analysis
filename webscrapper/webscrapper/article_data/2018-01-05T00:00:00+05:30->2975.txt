Actress   has shot for not one but two films in Bengaluru. But she is upset that she could not venture out and hang around the city hotspots, since she was shooting non-stop, till late at night. “It is a such a pity, because I really took to the city. The infrastructure here seems to be very meticulously planned and I was impressed with how clean the city is. There is traffic and the mess, but it is not chaotic. I like Bengaluru, from what I saw of it,” says Seerat, adding, “The people here are very nice and cooperative, which I saw during my shoot.” 
Point out to the leggy actress that she has two Kannada girls as co-stars in her upcoming Telugu film — Shraddha Srinath and   — and she says, “Oh, yes! Bengaluru people are sweet like I said.   is a doll. When they say no two actresses can by friends, I’d say that it is a myth because we get along like a house on fire. Shraddha is a nice girl as well, and we have had a great time when shooting together.”
 Seerat says that she is happy that the kind of films she has done thus far have allowed her to play different characters and avoid stereotyping. “I am looking at doing films that satisfy me creatively,” she adds. Will she do Kannada films, too? “I’d never say never. I’m taking baby steps in the industry right now, so I want to prove my worth where I have begun. I intend to do any film that interests me and this is not bound by languages. So, you never know. I have received a few offers for films here, though,” says Seerat.
