MARGAO: Former PWD minister   on Thursday accused defence minister   of “exerting pressure” on the Union ministry of home affairs ( ) to pass an order in favour of Benaulim MLA  .

 “In one order, one person of the MHA certifies that Caitu ceases to be an Indian citizen, and then the person is replaced by another who issues another order withdrawing the earlier one and declaring him an Indian citizen and not Portuguese. I have no doubt this is done at Parrikar’s behest,” Alemao told mediapersons. He was referring to the latest order issued by the MHA pronouncing Silva to be a citizen of India “and not a Portugal national”, and withdrawing its earlier order declaring him to be a Portuguese citizen.
 
 Alemao further ridiculed Silva for his purported statement that 27,000 people have been “saved” by MHA’s latest order. “The names of 27,000 people who have surrendered their Indian passports have already been struck off the electoral rolls. How can Caitu save them now?” Alemao said, stressing that he was in possession of some documents that would prove Silva’s acquisition of a Portuguese passport.
 
 Reacting to Silva’s claims that he would file a petition for damages against his daughter Valanka as well as John Fernandes for “mental harassment” and “malicious prosecution,” Alemao said that Valanka’s election petition in the high court “merely questioned if a foreign national can function as an elected representative.” The MHA order pertains to the complaint lodged by Fernandes and not Valanka, Alemao said.
