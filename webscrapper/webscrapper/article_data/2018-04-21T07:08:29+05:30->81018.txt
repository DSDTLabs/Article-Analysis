NEW DELHI: Nearly eight months after   officer   retired as chairman of  , the game of musical chairs continues in the state-run behemoth that supplies 80% of the country’s coal production.

 Suresh Kumar, an additional secretary in the coal ministry, is being given additional charge of the company, replacing   chief Gopal Singh, who has been doubling up as acting chairman of   since Bhattacharya’s retirement.
 
 After Bhattachrya superannuated on August 31 last year, Singh, who has risen through the ranks, was given the post of acting chairman of Coal India as an additional responsibility for three months. He was given extension of similar duration twice.
 
 During this time, the government had conducted the exercise to select Bhattacharya’s successor twice. First, government head hunter PESB rejected all the six candidates interviewed for the post and told the government to take a call on how to select the new CIL head.
 
 Subsequently, the government cast a wider net, seeking applications from the public sector entities, state and central governments as well as professionals from the private sector. This time too, the interviews were conducted but nothing much was heard since then.
 
 Kumar will be the third IAS officer to head Coal India after S Narsing Rao, who took over as chairman in April 2012 and Bhattacharya. Both Rao and Bhattacharya were from the   cadre.
