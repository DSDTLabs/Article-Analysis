 Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, the association state president P V Hamza said the sale of mango has shown a 75% dip.

 “Usually, around 200 loads of fruits arrive in Kerala daily. During the Ramzan it shoots up to around 400 loads. But now it has come down to less than fifty loads. In Kozhikode, the sale has come down to 10 loads from 25 loads. The market for banana also has come down drastically," Hamza said. The merchants said that the fruits bitten by bats are not being sold in Kerala. “The fruits sold here are brought from outside the state and even from foreign countries. But the propaganda through the social media has badly affected the sales,” he said.
 
 The sale of fruit juices in Kochi has also registered a drop in Kochi after the news of Nipah virus broke, despite this being the Ramzan fasting period. “People have become fearful.
 
 Mango juice has no takers but sale of vegetable juices like carrot has not been hit.,”
