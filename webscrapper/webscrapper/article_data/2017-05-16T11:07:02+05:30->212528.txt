CHANDIGARH: Chahat, a 10-month-old   from Amritsar weighing 20 kg, has tested   She is admitted to PGIMER and will be discharged on Tuesday. But the obesity linked to genetic disorder cannot be ruled out, according to her   

 "Her blood samples were planned to be sent to Spain but it is taking long as we have not received any response. They will be sent to Bangalore for exome sequencing (gene sequencing). This will cost around Rs 2 lakh," said Dr Devi Dayal, a paediatrician treating her. 
 
 Chahat's father is a cable operator and does not earn more than Rs 6,000 per month. He plans to go to his village in Amritsar and borrow money from relatives or friends. "It is not possible for us to arrange the amount within a day or so. But if need be, I will beg for help," said Suraj, father of the baby.
 
 The doctors also plan to subsequently put her on Continuous Positive  , required for those who suffer obstruction at the airway passage due to excessive obesity. "If she continues with obesity, we need to put her on this machine which is around Rs 35, 000," said Dr Dayal. Chahat is the only child of the young couple. "We had lost our one-day-old son two years ago. She is the only child. People would come and stare and sometimes laugh at her. If we are helped financially for her treatment, she can live a normal life," said Renu, mother of Chahat.
