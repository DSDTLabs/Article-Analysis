PATNA: Governor-cum-chancellor   has appointed VCs in six of the state’s ten universities, but he has yet not appointed pro-VC in any of these universities. The offices of pro-VC fell vacant simultaneously with those of VC on January 31 this year. 

 The chancellor’s secretariat advertised the posts of VC and pro-VC in October last year. More than 500 academics from all over the country applied. The search committees constituted by the chancellor for different universities are interacting with the shortlisted candidates.
 
 The search committees are also learned to have submitted to the chancellor’s office separate panels for both the offices for Veer Kunwar Singh, Jai Prakash , B R A Bihar, L N Mithila, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur and Magadh universities. However, the chancellor interacted with the recommended VC aspirants only.
 
 Sources said the chancellor’s secretariat has deliberately delayed the appointment of pro-VCs so that both the offices of VC and pro-VC do not fall vacant simultaneously as it happened this time. Recently, the chancellor had to appoint caretaker VCs in all the universities as both the VCs and pro-VCs had completed their three-year term on the same date.
 
 This time, the appointment of pro-VCs would be made only after the completion of the process of appointment of VCs in all the universities, the sources said.
 
 Efforts are on to appoint the new VCs for the remaining four universities. Interaction of shortlisted candidates with the search committee for selection of Patna University VC will take place on March 24 and 25. The search committee for Nalanda Open University VC will interact with the shortlisted candidates on March 27. 
 
 The interaction of shortlisted candidates for the appointment of VCs of Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University and B N Mandal University will be held in April. In all probability, the new pro-VCs will be appointed in April end or May, said the sources.
