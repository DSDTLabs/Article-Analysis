MUMBAI: The embattled   Group has received 25 final bids for its 30 properties, with nearly half of them going unwanted and the remaining seeing multiple offers.
 
  Mostly bids are from real estate and fast moving consumer goods companies, said persons familiar with the development. The deadline for sending final bids for these properties ended on May 20.
  
  “While earlier reports had suggested that some large corporates had shown interest in picking up these properties, some of these names are missing and have not (made a final) bid,” said one of the persons. Estimated valuation of the properties is Rs 7,400 crore and Sahara received a total 163 expressions of interest from 59 parties.
  
  The group is liquidating assets in order to make bail for its chief Subrata Roy, as per Supreme Court orders. An email and text messages to the Sahara Group spokesperson remained unanswered until the time of going to press. Knight Frank India, the transaction advisor, declined to comment for the story.
  
  The process of Sahara Group tying up with prospective buyers for these land parcels will be completed over the next two weeks. Most of the bids from interested parties are above the threshold of 90% of circle rate or ready reckoner rate.
  
  The properties are located in Delhi, Pune, Indore, Lucknow, Coimbatore, Bhopal, Raipur, Patna, Solapur, Kolkata, Kanpur, Chandigarh and Noida.
