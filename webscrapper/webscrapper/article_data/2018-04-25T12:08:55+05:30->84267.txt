DIBRUGARH: A blind beggar, who used to earn his livelihood by singing on the streets of Amtola in   district, has been accused of raping his 10-year-old daughter over a period of four months. 

 The accused used to live with his daughter and five-year-old son in a slum in Panigaon Amtola area on the outskirts of the town. The man has been absconding ever since the allegation surfaced against him.
 
 "We have placed the minor girl and her brother in the custody of their relatives. It is a very sad and unfortunate incident. The accused has gone into hiding, but he will be nabbed soon," Lakhimpur SP Sudhakar Singh said on Tuesday. The victim underwent a medical examination on Monday and police are waiting for the report now.
 
 The incident of   came to light when some neighbours caught him in the act a couple of days ago. The locals soon gathered and reportedly thrashed the man. But instead of handing him over to police, the crowd shot a video of the accused being beaten and uploaded the clip on social media.
