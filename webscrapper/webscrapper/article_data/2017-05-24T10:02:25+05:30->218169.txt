CHANDIGARH: Former Union minister and senior Congress leader   on Tuesday flayed the   government at the Centre, and the BJP government in Haryana for the piteous condition of farmers in the country and the state. “The grain mafia are flourishing in the BJP-ruled states under the patronage of the government. Daily, 35 farmers are forced to end their lives due to poverty and unpaid loans. This exposes the working style and character of the BJP government and its rulers in the state as well as the country,” said the former Union minister.

 Singh was in Chandigarh to review the preparation for organizational elections of the Congress party in Haryana, scheduled to be held in August and September. Citing figures of loan waivers to industrialists and the rich by the NDA government, he said: “Don’t you think this is an irony that the farmers — who form 62% of contributors to the economy — have been left to die, while the BJP government has facilitated its capitalists friends with a waiver of Rs 1.54 lakh thousand crore. This government has forgotten everything, including its promise of giving 50% profit over the input cost of crops to farmers,” he said.
 
 Jitendra, who was flanked by Haryana Congress chief  , and Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee (CTCC) head  , termed the government announcement of the loan waiver for Uttar Pradesh farmers as ‘jumla.’
