THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Techies, who were demanding better transport system in and around Technopark, can now afford to relax.   service, which was cancelled two years ago, is all set for a re-launch. This time,   Travel and Tourism Cooperative Society Ltd will conduct its operations.

 A trial run of the short-route bus service, exclusively for Technopark employees, will be done next week. The society is planning to start operations in full swing by March.
 
 Secretary of the society   said the aim is to ensure that employees will have a safe, hassle-free transport option at minimum cost. “The service will be operated exclusively for employees with valid ID cards issued by companies at Technopark. The boarding points will be Kazhakkoottam Railway station, Kazhakkoottam Junction, Kariavattom Junction and   to Technopark Phase-I, Technopark Phase-II, UST Global and Infosys, he said.
 
 The fare will be collected on a monthly bases using prepaid access cards provided by the society. 
 
 The society is also planning to provide an app through which the route and next boarding point and expected time of arrival can be known to the user.
 
 Meanwhile, JRTO Binumon K said that he received a proposal for running Technopark Express only on Wednesday. “I don’t think there is any hurdle before the service. However, permission will be given only after seeking opinion from higher officials,” he said. The service will be available from 7.30am to 10pm at regular intervals.
 
 Technopark employee Biju Sundaran welcomed the move and said: “It will be a relief when one considers the fleecing by autos and night travel. We will also know when the next trip is, making it convenient”.
