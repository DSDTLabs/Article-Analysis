The secretary concerned was informed about this development, but the government chose to maintain a silence in this regard and its machinery got into action on the night the VGGS event finished.
 
 The petitioner claimed that the state government has made a false statement on affidavit, when it said that it came to know about presence of bird flu on January 11 when it received a report of the sample sent to a laboratory in Bhopal.
 
 During the hearing, a bench of Justice R S Reddy and   asked the lawyers whether the monitoring of the situation at ground zero is satisfactory.
