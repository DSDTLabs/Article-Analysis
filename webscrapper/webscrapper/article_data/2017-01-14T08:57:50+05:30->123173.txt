JODHPUR: The   (ACB) on Friday arrested five persons, including former vice-chancellor of   (JNV) University B S Rajpurohit and former Congress MLA Jugal Kabra in connection with the alleged irregularities in recruitment of teachers in 2012. 

 Kabra was a member of the university syndicate when the alleged irregularities occurred. 
 
 Congress leaders called the arrest of Kabra as 'politically motivated'. Former chief minister   said, "When chief minister Vasundhara Raje visited Jodhpur last time, she had directed the ACB to act against the political opponents by pursuing false cases pending against them. Kabra's arrest is part of a political conspiracy. I am not against a fair probe by the ACB, but I condemn the misuse of government machinery for political purposes."
 
 PCC chief   said, "The arrest of Kabra is politically motivated. The charges against him have been dismissed by the high court. His arrest on the same charges is a contempt of court."
