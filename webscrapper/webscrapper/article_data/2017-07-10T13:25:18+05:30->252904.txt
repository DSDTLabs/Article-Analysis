The rainy season is here and   are looking forward to enjoying the   with some chai pakora and long drives. Here are some monsoon must-dos for city’s youngsters:
 
  Kush and Adnan take a ride across Cantonment
 
 
 
 Kush, a graduate from Rampur Garden, says, "For me, a long drive to Cantonment is a ‘must-do’ thing during monsoon. The lush green surroundings make for a perfect car or a bike ride."

 Prateeksha, a resident of Rampur Garden, pursuing a course in management, says, "During monsoon, the popular bhutta joints in DD Puram, Rajendra Nagar and Cantonment get flooded with bhutta-lovers gorging on bhuttas with lemon and spices. At times, we buy some bhuttas and go to a nearby park and enjoy eating it while spending some qualitative time with friends and family members while enjoying the weather."

 Angad, a resident of Rajendra Nagar who is pursuing BBA, says, "Baarish ke mausam mein roadside khoke par doston ke saath chai aur samosa enjoy karne ka mazaa he kuch aur hai. During rainy season, I prefer going to tea-joints in Rajendra Nagar and Gandhi Nagar, jahan par   ke samose bahut famous hain."

 Adnan, a graduate from old city, says, "I love cycling enjoy during this season. I live in the old city area, there isn’t much space around, and so I prefer going to Cantonment for cycling."
