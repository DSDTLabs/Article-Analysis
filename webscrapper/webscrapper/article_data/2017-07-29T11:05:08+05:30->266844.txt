MOHALI: The biometric   has paved way for a 14-year-old boy to unite with his family. 

 In presence of Mohali district child welfare officer   and members of missing children’s home, Ludhiana, the boy, Vishnu was handed over to his parents Papu and Meera by deputy commissioner (DC)   in Mohali on Friday.
 
 Sapra said, the child went missing from Nuh village in Rajasthan in 2015 and was found by government railway police (GRP) at Ludhiana railway station. GRP handed over the boy to child protection officer in Ludhiana and was later admitted to government school in Kurali. The school management, while enrolling the children for Aadhaar card, discovered that his credentials were not adequate enough and the application was rejected. Later, the school management applied for the Adhaar card in Chandigarh. During the biometric assertions, the credential of the boy matched with that of his parents in Nuh village in Rajasthan. The information was passed on to the Rajasthan counterparts leading to the reunion of the boy with his parents.
 
 Sapra said, “We never thought that   registration can unite missing children with their families. This proves that Adhaar card enrollment is a must.”
