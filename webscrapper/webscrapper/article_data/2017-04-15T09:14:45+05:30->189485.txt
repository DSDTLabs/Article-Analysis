VADODARA: Son of the head of   of M S University’s Faculty of Performing Arts was caught copying in the fourth-semester   of Masters of Performing Arts by the by MSU’s vigilance squad. 

 Durgesh Gangani, son of officiating head of the Department of Dance Jagdish Gangani, was caught the university’s vigilance squad after they saw he had scribbled some artist’s name on the hall ticket on Thursday. The reputed family of Kathak dancers, however, said that events of Thursday are being twisted and wrongly presented to defame them. 
 
 While another masters student of music (vocal) who was caught with multiple chits was allegedly allowed to continue in the exam, Durgesh was asked to come out of the class for thorough checking even as the squad found nothing objectionable from him. 
 
 Both the cases have been referred to university head office. The unfair means committee of   will now decide whether the students are guilty or innocent based on which further action will be initiated. 
 
 Durgesh, who is aspiring a gold medal and has performed with several national and international artists, told TOI that when he entered the classroom he was revising a topic. “Question papers were distributed and the central supervisors who had come to sign the hall tickets had also found nothing written on my hall ticket. The question paper consisted of some artists whose names were difficult to remember. I thought it better to write down the names so that I don’t forget them later. And hence, I had written them on the hall ticket,” said Durgesh. 
 
 “The issue is being blown out of proportion as I am son of a famous kathak dancer and belong to a reputed family,” he said. 
 
 “University’s vigilance squad should have heard him. We hope that we will get justice. My son does not need to adopt any unfair mean to clear his exam,” Jagdish Gangani told TOI.
