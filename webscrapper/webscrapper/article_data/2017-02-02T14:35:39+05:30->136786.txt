With the new budget system in force from this year, railway officials here on Wednesday struggled to get details about allocations and approval of various proposals they had forwarded to the  .

 The divisional railway managers (DRMs) of both, South East   (SECR) and Central Railway could not get hold of the ‘pink book’, which usually has all the details about fund allotment and sanctions under every head. Earlier, this book used to be uploaded on the railway website an hour after presentation of the budget.
 
 Central Railway DRM Brijesh Kumar   hailed the new accounting accrual system. “There will be now no compartmentalization and there will be synergy between highways, roads, airways and other modes of transport,” he said.
 
 Another benefit of the system is that railways will now not have to pay huge dividend to the Centre. Last year it paid Rs 9,000 crore as dividend. All the divisions had to share this liability, which is now thing of the past. 
 
 “We stand to gain as railway allocation has gone up from Rs 47,000 crore to Rs 55,000 crore, and plan outlay has also been pegged at Rs 1.31 crore from Rs 1.21 crore. Now money will also flow in under new safety fund,” said Gupta.
 
 The DRM said new policy shift envisages to generate non-fare revenues by cashing on assets like railway land and advertisements. “It is possible that trains originating from Nagpur will be branded now,” he added.
 
 Of the 700 stations to be run on solar, 37 have been identified under SECR (18) and Central Railway (19). Of the new lines (third & fourth), 600km will be under Central Railway.
 
 SECR’s senior   said, “We have sought funds for several works like increasing height and length of platforms, FOBs, pit lines etc, but it would be known only on February 3, how much funds we have got.”
 
 There is also sanction to install four escalators at Nagpur station and lifts at each platform. Sibal said an escalator is being installed at Gondia.
