As the fear looms of a cut in Narmada water supply, villagers have begun searching for alternate sources. Village bodies have already started digging additional borewells; some have made arrangements to call in water tankers.

 Amratji Makwana, the sarpanch of Nekariya village in  , said: "Recently, the Narmada canal was closed for maintenance and we faced a severe crisis. Three neighbourhoods in the village needed water tankers." Makwana said the village plans to get additional electric motors to pump water. "We are supplying water for 90 minutes daily," he said. "But in summer we will have to do with water supply for 60 minutes only, or get tankers."
 
 Varsha Patel, the sarpanch of Ranesara village in Mehsana, said the village has a population of 5,500. "We don’t know the specifics of the supply cuts," Patel said. "We will dig more borewells." Prahlad Patel, a resident of the village, said that the village is completely dependent on Narmada water and hence when the panchayat proposed to construct borewells, industries in the vicinity volunteered to bear 10% of the cost.
 
 Bhurabhai Joshi, a resident  , said that the village can meet the drinking water needs, but around 50% of the population stay in the fields and were dependent only on Narmada for drinking water. But the canal is drying up. "We get water at 40 feet when we dig borewells, but the water is highly saline," Joshi said.
 
 Even nagarpalikas have made provisions for borewells. Mehsana nagarpalika’s 33 MLD supply comprised 30 MLD of Narmada water. Sanjay Bhrahmbhatt, the chairman of the water committee, said: "We will have to construct 10 borewells or bring in water tankers." He said the quantum of supply cut was yet unknown.
