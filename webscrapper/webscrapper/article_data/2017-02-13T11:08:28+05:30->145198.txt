HOWRAH: The second edition of the   will adjudge the best Bengali films that were released last year. This is being done to encourage the Bengali film industry and its stalwarts who have time and again made the nation proud. The announcement for the second edition of the coveted award was made by actor Jeet at a Howrah mall on Sunday. 

 The statuettes of the black lady will be given away on February 25 at a star-studded awards night to be organized at Science City. Organizers of the country’s best-loved award felt that since Bengali films were witnessing a revolution in experimental and creative content, the regional award should also continue. 
 
 The greatest names in the history of Indian films naturally point towards Bengal — starting with Bimal Roy,  , Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak,  , R D Burman, Manna Dey and   to the more recent Konkona Sen Sharma, Shreya Ghoshal, Pritam and Shaan. By instituting this award, Jio   is paying a tribute to these greats and their contribution. The organizers felt that with more and more talented youngsters joining the film industry in the east, the award will definitely be an encouragement.
 
 “We have all grown up watching Filmfare Awards and we know it stands for excellence in cinema. So there cannot be better news for us than the fact that organizers are coming for the second time to honour Bengali films. I would urge Jio Filmfare to make this a permanent thing because this will boost our industry like nothing else can. While people’s love and affection are what we crave, awards go a long way to boost confidence,” Jeet said.
 
 The awards will be given in 27 categories. While there will be 10 in the popular categories, the remaining will be given in the technical and critics’ categories.
