The film is set in north Madras and revolves around a guy (played by hero  ), who comes to a particularly notorious locality for some work. He gets beaten by a local rowdy ( ) and things change for both of them as a video of their fight goes viral on social media. 

 Ravi says, “The film is both serious and entertaining. I have titled it ‘Seyal’ because the film has a social message. The seyal that the hero decides to do, irrespective of whether he is a friend or his enemy, will be a lesson that audiences can take home.”
 
 Kerala-based Tharushi plays the female lead in the film.   says that he has got on board several newcomers, and each of them have performed really well. “Rajan did all the stunts by himself. In fact, he hurt himself while filming a fight sequence. But he was keen on doing the stunt without a body double. He even trained under Kanal Kannan master for the same,” he says.
