Guntur: The endowments department has decided to reclaim all land parcels which were illegally sold in the last 40 to 50 years.

 The department has decided to initiate legal proceedings against the present landlords by filing cases in the endowments tribunals. The decision of the department is creating ripples among the landholders as many of them claim to have purchase the land.
 
 According to initial reports, the endowments department has identified about 5,800 acre as encroached or illegally sold in Guntur district.
 
 After a comprehensive survey, the department decided to approach the tribunal seeking ownership rights over the disputed lands. Sources said the land in question is in the hands of about 1,200-1,400 people. The department will issue eviction notices to all the land holders and file cases in the endowments tribunal.
 
 Sources said the department had been mulling over initiating criminal and civil action against these ‘encroachers’ for long as reclaiming of land has been considered as the best solution to improve the revenues of the temples.
 
 Interestingly, the endowments department took the decision after getting huge compensation for its lands from Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA). The endowments department had handed over nearly 725 acres of land belonging to different temples in 29 villages in the capital city area under LPS. The landowning temples would get its share of land under LPS in next few years.
 
 In fact, most of the temples in the capital city area are struggling to manage even the daily puja and harathi expenses due to low revenues from the land leases and hundi collections. CRDA is now paying annual lease of Rs 65,000 per acre for riverbank lands and Rs 39,000 per acre for the dry lands. 
 
 Taking the capital city experiences into account, the endowments department has decided to protect its lands and initiated measures to reclaim the lands that have been illegally gone into the hands of private people.
