GUWAHATI: An   team under the guidance of D  , the designer of the Indian rupee sign, has come up with an innovative   geography textbook with redefined images and illustrations to make classroom teaching exciting. 

 "Textbooks play an important role in a student's education system. The present schoolbooks need good design for better subject understanding and learning. This project is an attempt to redesign the current geography textbook, which lacks good visual content and ease of reading. We hope that this project will make a difference in the students' learning experience," said Udaya Kumar, who is a faculty member of the design department at IIT-G.
 
 The redesigned NCERT textbook contains various new elements like 'Activity', 'Do You Know' and others to help maintain the reading flow.
 
 Pranav Niphadkar, a graphic design student of the institute, undertook this master thesis project under the guidance of Udaya Kumar. The project had started with visits to several schools and interactions with students and teachers. "My inspiration for taking the project comes from the realization of the impact that a good textbook has in a student's life," said Pranav.
