LUCKNOW: UP Police’s special task force (STF) arrested Dayaram  , a notorious member of nomadic gang, who along with his aides went in a dacoity and killings spree in Lucknow, Barabanki and   earlier this year.

 
 UP Police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on him after his name had surfaced.
 
 Dayaram was held after a brief encounter in Rampur where he went to visit a relative. He was spotted in front of a school in Rampur. A police team which was following him on an informer’s tip-off surrounded him. Dayaram opened fire but was overpowered by STF sleuths. STF cops were keeping a tab on Dayaram’s movement after he escaped during an encounter on February 3 along with Vinod, Kalia and Ramveer while four other members, Rajesh alias Patela, Manoj alias Chhotu, Ramesh and   were arrested.
 
 STF SSP Abhishek Singh said that Vinod and Ramveer were later arrested but Dayaram, the most notorious among all gang members, managed to evade cops. Dayaram continuously kept changing his location and mobile numbers to dodge the police team tracking him, he said.
 
 “Dayaram had been hiding at different locations in   and Haryana since February. We recently got a tip-off about his movement in Rampur where he was planning to meet one relative. The STF team arrested him when he arrived in Rampur on Friday,” the SSP said. Dayaram was later brought to Lucknow and a firearm used in the crime was recovered from   area on his revelations.
