NEW DELHI:   on Monday cited repeated suspicions expressed by the kin of special CBI judge HB Loya to push for an investigation into his death, saying serious questions hang over the issue.

 A day after the son of judge Loya said the family did not suspect any foul play in the death, AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said   himself sought an inquiry in 2015.
 
 He said two sisters of the deceased judge had expressed doubts about the death being caused by natural causes and that too “contemporaneously”. He said the father of the judge too had endorsed the views expressed by his daughters.
 
 Judge Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin's fake encounter case in which   chief   was an accused.
 
 Congress chief   had on Friday sought a top-level probe into the case after it was cited as one of the reasons behind the virtual rebellion by four senior-most   judges against the Chief Justice of India. Rahul had called it a serious issue.
 
 The opposition party's aggression seems to reflect the view that pushing the case would put BJP on the backfoot since it relates to the saffron leadership.
 
 Quoting from statements made by family members in the wake of  , Singhvi said Anuj's “retraction two years later” had to be seen against the clear views in favour of inquiry expressed by five others in the family.
