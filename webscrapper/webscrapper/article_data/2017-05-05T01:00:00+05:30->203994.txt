RK Suresh, who is presently shooting for  , hurt himself while filming a stunt sequence. The actor is presently resting due to his injury and he will join the shoot of his other film commitments soon.   says, “We were almost finishing the first schedule. It was an action scene, which was set up in a local bar in  . There was oil, hot water and fire close by. Accidentally, the hot oil and hot water spilled on my hands and my legs. It was burning a lot and slowly, the boils showed up. We couldn’t find any hospital there as it was a late-night shoot. We had to drive down to Madurai to get the first aid done. I got to take two days rest and I am feeling better now.” Suresh says he will go back to his shooting commitments from this week. “On May 7, I have to shoot with Udhayanidhi. The next day, I have to shoot for a Kalaiarasan film and Vikram’s Sketch. I can’t afford to take too many breaks as I have work. I hope it settles down by then,” he says.
