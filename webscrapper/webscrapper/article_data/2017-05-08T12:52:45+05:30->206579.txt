Off late we have seen superstar   doing diverse roles. Without sticking to his usual romantic hero-style, he has been vastly experimenting with other characters and we totally love it.

 According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Shah Rukh Khan is currently working on a script about the heroism and undying courage of   and Air Force. The script in question is reportedly based on one of the India’s most successful missions, “Operation Khukri”, in Sierra Leone in 2000.
 
 Talking about the film, a source stated, “It has been researched extensively and will be mounted on a really large scale. 
 ” 
 
 This project is apparently going to be among the most expensive films SRK’s Red Chillies   has ever produced. The source further added, “

 Now, the cast of the movie is yet to be decided and it is not sure whether Shah Rukh will be portraying any character in the movie. Since the film is still in the premature stage and is just being penned down, it is too soon to even assume the cast without clearly knowing the script.
 
 But, we certainly hope that Shah Rukh dons an Army man yet again as he looks absolutely striking in a uniform.
