LUCKNOW: The   leadership has asked   to use his network within the   cadre to wean away  's support base in UP and help the Congress win the upcoming bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur. 

 Siddiqui, who was expelled from the BSP last year, joined the Congress on Thursday.
 
 Siddiqui and his son Afzal are learnt to have been given the task a day after their meeting with the Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party's UP in charge Ghulam Nabi Azad on Thursday.
 
 The father-son duo has also been asked to reach UP Congress Committee headquarters in Lucknow on Saturday and chalk out a strategy with the state leaders.
 
 While Siddiqui was unavailable for comment, Afzal confirmed to TOI that they would soon be roping in their 'teams' to campaign in Phulpur and Gorakhpur. "It's just a start for us to prove our utility for the Congress. Let's hope we prove our worth," Afzal said. He said they still have enough supporters within and outside the BSP who are willing to support the Congress.
 
 Political experts said Congress sees a chance to wean away some BSP support base in the wake of Mayawati not contesting byelections for the two seats. "Siddiqui was one of the few BSP functionaries who managed the party's grassroots cadre.
