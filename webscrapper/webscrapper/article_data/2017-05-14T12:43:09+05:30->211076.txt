AURANGABAD: The city police are planning to equip their four-wheelers with mobile phones, which will improve connectivity and also serve as   trackers to help the police control room keep tabs of the vehicles.

 As many as 85 vehicles used by the city police will be equipped with the mobile phones. “These mobile phones would act as a parallel source of communication for us. We will install a GPS application in these phones as well,”   commissioner of police Yashasvi Yadav told TOI.
 
 There are several spots in the city where the wireless sets used by the police do not work due to poor range. The police also face network issues while using these devices from building basements, inside huge structures and areas with several trees or high-rise buildings. There are also some hilly areas around the city where the wireless sets do not have network.
 
 As on date, the police stations of Cantonment, Daulatabad, Waluj and MIDC Waluj, Harsul and MIDC Cidco have certain pockets where the wireless sets face network problems. The areas where their telecommunication devices do not operate or do not have network are identified as black holes.
 
 Yadav, who was appointed as the city police commissioner recently, came up with the idea of installing mobile phones in police vehicles, a majority of which are patrolling vans, as a solution to the limitations faced with the traditional communication sets.
 
 The officer said most of the city’s areas have mobile coverage. Considering this, the police can be sure of being in touch round-the-clock with their teams, even when they are in remote areas.
 
 To ensure the devices are used for official purposes, the handset will be limited to incoming calls and only a single mobile application — GPS — can be installed on it.
 
 A senior officer, privy to the development, said that if things proceed according to plan, the city police will launch the service any time during the next week.
