KOLKATA: A 62-year-old retired government official in   committed suicide after murdering his wife on Thursday night. Sambhu Nath Mandal left a suicide note admitting to killing wife Jayanti, 50, because he was unable to pay for her treatment.Jayanti had suffered a stroke three months back and had been bedridden since then. Cops have started a probe into the case.

 Prima facie, police said that Mandal possibly smothered his wife and then hanged himself from the ceiling fan. The Baguiati police have initiated a case under Section 302 IPC against Mandal over Jayanti's death following a formal complaint lodged by the couple's younger son Subir. A case of un natural death has been registered in Mandal's case.
 
 Locals said that the couple's two sons stay in the same house. According to Subir Mandal, his father was paying for Jayanti's treatment with his pension money . “The expenses were going up -it touched almost Rs 1,300 per day . My father was a retired government official and did not have much financial support. We have a flat in Rajarhat and I had told him some time back to sell it. But my father did not agree,“ he said.
 
 Subir said that on Thursday , he had left the house around 8pm and his elder brother and sister-in-law were also out. His mother's nurse came to the house around 9.45pm and found the door locked from the inside. She called out to Mandal but nobody responded from inside. The nurse then called up the couple's sons and Subir rushed home. When they broke open the door, they found Mandal hanging and his wife lying dead on the bed. The police were then alerted, who sent the bodies for postmortem. The couple's room has also been sealed.
 
 Locals said that Mandal had been visibly worried about how to carry on with his wife's expensive treatment and had lately become depressed.His wife was supposed to undergo another surgery after the Puja, which made him worry about their financial condition.
