Even as the State Election Commission (SEC) has not announced a date for municipal elections in Ludhiana, Punjab chief minister   on Monday said the polls are likely to be held before February 24. He was replying to a question on the proposed cabinet expansion and said it would happen after the election process is over.

 Though an official spokesperson clarified that Amarinder was only talking of tentative dates, the   (SAD) took a dig at the Congress government. SAD spokesperson   said, “The announcement of Ludhiana MC poll schedule by the CM himself indicates that the state government has taken total control of the State Election Commission. Soon, the government will also send the readymade result to the SEC for notification.”
 
 Earlier, local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had said that elections for Ludhiana civic body were likely to be held before February 20. “We are targeting the first week of February, but the State Election Commission will take the final call,” Sidhu had told mediapersons on February 4.
 
 The State Election Commission has, meanwhile, not made any formal announcement about the date of election even though it has been almost a month since the corporations in three cities of Patiala, Amritsar and   were elected.
 
 Elections in Ludhiana were deferred as the delimitation process was not complete and local leadership of the Congress too wanted some more time to prepare for the polls. The Congress has won majority of seats in the corporations that went to polls.
 
 An official spokesperson said Amarinder has not announced any date for the election and has only said that the elections were likely to be held by February 24 and the state election commission will take a call on the date.
