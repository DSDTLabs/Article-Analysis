Tirupur: Hardly a week after the murder of a childless elderly couple in Nachipalayam near Palladam, another couple was found dead in a pool of blood at their farmhouse near Kangeyam on Thursday. The victims were identified as 65-year-old C Palanisami of Neelakattuthottam in Veeranampalayam and his 57-year-old wife Kannammal. “Palanisami was a farmer, who owned 28 acres of agricultural land. He was staying at the farmhouse with Kannammal. Their son and daughter, who are married, are living elsewhere. On Thursday morning, a farm labourer, who was assigned to milk cows at the farm found both of them dead in front of their house in a pool of blood. The bodies carried injury marks,” a police officer said. Preliminary investigations revealed that the couple had not locked the door of the house before going to sleep. “As the house was located in the centre of the farm and the closest neighbour was at least a kilometre away, it made the murderers’ job easy. However, as no valuables were found missing, we can’t say it was for gain,” the officer said. Kangeyam police registered a case and handed over the bodies to the relatives after conducting a postmortem. Seventy-year-old C Muthukumarasamy of Nachipalayam and his wife 65-year-old Deivathal were found hacked to death at their farmhouse on December 29. District superintendent of police ES Uma told TOI that police are yet to establish the motive behind the murder.  “So far, we haven’t found any similarities in the murders other than that both were aged couples, who stayed alone,” a police officer said.
