DEHRADUN: Leaders of Students Federation of India (SFI), Dehradun, burnt effigies of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) administration on Monday and demanded that all institutes should set up a gender sensitization committee against sexual harassment (GSCASH) in a bid to avoid any such incidents in the future.   “What happened at BHU was a slur against democratic rights. On one hand, the government speaks about Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao and on the other hand, unfortunate incidents such as these are taking place,” said Himanshu Chauhan, SFI leader of DAV College.    Meanwhile, the federation has demanded a fair probe into the matter and action against guilty, besides demanding that a gender sensitization committee against sexual harassment (GSCASH) should be set up at the earliest in educational institutes across the country.    “Force should not be used on girls. It shows the failure of the government in controlling or managing the situation. PM Modi was in Varanasi for two days but despite being an advocate of Beti Bachao, he did not meet the girls, which shows where he stands,” said Shailendra Parmar, another SFI leader from DAV college,    Other student leaders said that safety should be ensured to youngsters such that freedom of girls is not curtailed.
