HYDERABAD: The Telangana budget for 2017-18 presented by finance minister Etela Rajendra on Monday has championed the cause of the backward classses as propounded by chief minister  . The thrust of the government was very clear at a time when the government is riding high on popularity and hopes to reap benefits in a future election, which insiders say might be ahead of schedule. 

 There were sops galore for BC communities. The total money allocated for various schemes for BCs stood at Rs 5,070 crore. Some schemes included as first reported in TOI, free sheep for shepherds financial assistance for fishermen to buy nets, motorcycles and Boleros for transportation, financial assistance to 1.50 lakh barbers to est up their own saloons, for goldsmiths to set up polishing and jewellery making centres and for carpenters to avail one-time loan to set up display centres in towns and mandal headquarters.
 
 Also, a corpus of Rs 1,000 crore has been allocated to set up a corporation to assist most backward caste people.
 
 With GST roll-out imminent, the budget was silent on taxation and as is the practice has left it to Cabinet to take calls on any hikes in taxes. Defying demonetization and economic slowdown, the Telangana government presented a revenue-surplus budget for the third consecutive year with total proposals worth 1,49,646 crore for the year 2017-18. The budget reported a healthy 15% increase reflecting the buoyancy in the economy. 
 
 The total expenditure on salaries, establishment, pensions and maintenance was pegged at Rs 61,607.20 crore and an expenditure of Rs 88,038.80 crore earmarked for development works. It was the first Telangana budget that did away with plan and nonplan categorization after the Centre changed the budgetary pattern.
 
 The budget estimates for 2017-18 in dicate a revenue surplus of Rs 4,571.30 crore and a fiscal deficit of Rs 26,096.31 crore, which is 3.48% of the estimated GSDP and well within the FRBM limits. It is noteworthy that the expenditure proposed under the Pragati Paddu (development account) was higher than the committed expenditure.“This has become possible due to rationalisation of expenditure and efforts to mobilize additional resources. The demonetisation effect is minimal. This is a pro-poor and BC welfare budget“ the finance minister said.
 
 Irrigation, power, education, welfare, roads and buildings, agriculture and rural water supply received higher allocations. The state's revenue receipts are proposed at Rs 69,220.37 crore as compared with `58,636 crore in 201617. Similarly , transfers from the Centre are estimated at Rs 43,862.67 crore compared to Rs 28,433.78 crore last year.
 
 TRS party flagship schemes Kalyan Laxmi and Shaadi Mubarak received huge increase with the government's decision to increase the onetime marriage assistance to poor women to Rs 75,116 from Rs 51,000. The double bedroom scheme did not get any funds in the budget.
 
 Mission Bhagiratha and  , two success stories of the TRS government, received funding in the budget while the irrigation department once again wrested the lion's share of 25,000 crore allocation.
 
 With the Centre taking 2011-12 as the base year for estimating GSDP, Telangana is expected to benefit as it would result in an increase in borrowing limits under FRBM. If that happens, the TRS government will receive a big boost in the next financial year.
