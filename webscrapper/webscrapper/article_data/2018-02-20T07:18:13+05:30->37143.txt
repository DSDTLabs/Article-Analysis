AHMEDABAD: The last rites of Dalit activist   — who died on Friday night after he set himself ablaze seeking land rights for Dalits — was performed on Monday. Family members of Vankar (65) decided to bury the mortal remains after the state government accepted its major demands ranging from the   in Dudkha village in   within three days and the withdrawal of cases against Dalits that were lodged during three days of protest against Vankar’s death.

  
  “His body was buried according to Buddhist rituals by two Bhantes (Buddhist religious leaders) in the Unjha crematorium ground in Mehsana district,” said Mehul Vankar, Vankar’s nephew. “We had taken the decision to accept his body late last on Sunday night because the government had accepted our major demands. If the government fails to fulfil our demands on time, we will start an intensified stir.”
 
  
  Many members of the Dalit community, including   and independent MLA from Vadgam, Jignesh Mevani, took part in the funeral procession of Vankar.
 
 The demands include an order by the district collector to allocate land to landless Dalits in all districts across the state within six months. Besides, land has been demanded for the landless Dalits of Dudkha village of Sami taluka of Patan district for whom Vankar had set himself ablaze outside the Patan collector’s office on February 15. He died of burn injuries at a private hospital in Ahmedabad on Friday. The government has also said a special investigation team will be formed and cops who were present at the collectorate when the incident happened would be suspended.
