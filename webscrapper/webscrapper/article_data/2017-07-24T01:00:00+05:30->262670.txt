 is known as one of the most fitness-conscious personalities in  . Even though the actor is in his mid-50s, the fitness buff never skips a day in the gym and is known to be particular about what he eats. 

 However, we recently learnt that the one city that manages to throw his diet plan into disarray is Delhi. When we caught up with him during his recent visit to the capital, the actor told us, “Delhi is known for its food. Every time I come to the city, I cheat on my diet. And how could I not? The capital is one place where you have to cheat! You have such amazing food here, be it   or gol gappas. Here, bhaturas are twice the size of what we get in Bombay.” The actor, however, clarified that cheating on the diet isn’t as catastrophic as one might think. He said, “If you don’t cheat, you will never be conscious about what you should eat and should not. So cheating is essential to staying fit. Of course, you should only do it occasionally.”
 
 The actor also talked about his new association with boxing. He said, “I have a connection with boxing because I used to kickbox when I was younger. Whatever I am in my career as an action star, I owe it to that skill. I felt that getting involved with boxing was something I could do. Additionally, these newer leagues can use some support and help. Be it kabaddi, wrestling or boxing, sports that need some push should be supported. I am just happy that sports apart from cricket are being seen as career options these days.”
