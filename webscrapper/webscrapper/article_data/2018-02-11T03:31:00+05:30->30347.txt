Guntur: People from coastal Andhra Pradesh are known for their acumen in making money through innovation. 

 They were the first ones from India to cross the oceans and capture foreign markets with their business skills, particularly in the food sector. However, the bifurcation of the state prompted many of them to return to their homeland. And with them they have brought them the habit of innovations and experiments. The launch of Mandi, an Arabian restaurant in Vijayawada and Guntur. The locals seemed to have latched on to the new trend. New restaurants are being flooded by foodies. 
 
 “People always want a change. This prompted us to launch a new venture with Mandi,” said owner P Manoj. He said that Arabian food is fast catching up as people in Guntur and Vijayawada do not have much recreational options, except for food. 
 
 Arabian food joints such as Mandi, serve various dishes, including the popular mandi, a traditional dish from Yemen. Mandi is made from rice, and meat — either lamb or chicken. The meat used is that of young and small-sized lambs. “It looks like biryani. But it is not biryani,” says chef Yasmin. 
 
 Seating arrangement in Mandis has attracted the youngsters, and so does the way they serve biryani. A group is served food in a big plate, sufficient for 4-6 people. Foodies love the Arabian ambience besides the food.
