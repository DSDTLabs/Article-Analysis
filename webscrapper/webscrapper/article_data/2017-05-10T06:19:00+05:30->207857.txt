VISAKHAPATNAM:   breathe easy. If the Greater   Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has its way, all   will be sustained till the end of this   to provide supplies to residents.

 Senior corporation officials attribute this greatly to the favourable rainfall in the catchment areas of the water sources, including reservoirs and rivers, and repairs undertaken to the Yeleru left main canal (YLMC) by GVMC for Rs 3.08 crore. 
 
 “The normal supply of water per capita supply is 105.19 LPCD. We are now supplying 86.66 LPCD,” superintending engineer, GVMC, P Ananda Rao told TOI. YLMC which had reserves going dry last summer this time had augmented reserves thanks to the repairs.
 
 GVMC’s normal water supply from its water sources per day is 58.40 MGD (million gallons per day). Now, it gets 50.10 MGD. The present supply is far better than that of the last year, according to a senior GVMC official. “It was around 46 MGD last year,” he recalled.
 
 As on May 9, the corporation distributed total received water (50.10 MGD) to industrial consumers (11.30 MGD) and 38.80 MGD to 2.035 million domestic consumers in its jurisdiction, including Bheemili and Anakapalli. For the unserved and ill-served areas, GVMC supplied 3.999MGD of water through autos and tankers by undertaking 514 trips in a day.
 
 One sore point was the fact that Gambheeram Gedda reservoir, which is 30 km away from the city, has dried up. Its maximum water level is 126 feet, its minimum drawdown level is 107 ft. The reservoir has reached a depth of 107 ft now.
 
 “Last year we had faced problems. We started pumping water from Yeleru from January, but this time we started from March 31. Last time, we were able to get 13 MGD of water from Yeleru, but this time we were able to get 29 MGD of water from the Yeleru due to the repair work. This apart, we are now able to supply water not only to the people, but also also storing the water at Meghadrigedda reservoir up to 10 MGD of water out of the total 29 MGD," Ananda Rao told TOI.
