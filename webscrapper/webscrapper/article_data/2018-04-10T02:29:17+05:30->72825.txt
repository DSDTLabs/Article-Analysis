THANE: The Thane municipal corporation ( ) on Saturday launched a multi-purpose   called my property   portal. 

 The website, which earlier was restricted to just bill payments, will now allow users to get updates, alerts about property as well as avail receipts of property-related certificates.
 
 In order to become a member, tax bearers have to register themselves on http://myptax.thanecity.gov.in/. They would then have to provide with their email-id and mobile number after which a one-time password would be generated by the server. For later logins, users merely need to key in their registered mobile number. 
 
 Omprakash Divate, deputy commissioner in charge of Property Tax, said, “We have incorporated some new functions in the portal which will not only be beneficial for the tax payers, but also for the administration to analyze and manage records of every citizen Tax payers will get regular updates, and would also be able to download receipts and certificates related to their property.”
