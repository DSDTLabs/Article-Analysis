Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( ) has proposed to widen the 8-km-long civic road parallel to National Highway-16 in the city into a four-lane road.

 The stretch begins at Venkojipalem Junction 16 towards Srikakulam and ends on the highway towards Anakapalli before the Naval Science and Technological Laboratory (NSTL) at NAD Junction.
 
 A GVMC official said, “A detailed project report (DPR) is being prepared. The proposed road will ease traffic on NH-16 from Venkojipalem to NAD Junction. It will be a parallel four-lane road to the highway in the city limits via Seethammadhara and Murali Nagar.”
 
 The project will cost Rs 15 crore. GVMC is planning to seek financial aid from Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) for the project. The VPT will pay 49% of its total tax in cash. It will contribute the balance 51% of the tax to any project or work suggested by GVMC for public cause.
 
 “Yes, we are negotiating with VPT for funds. The proposal is at initial stage,” the GVMC official said.
 
 Visakhapatnam North MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju said he was not aware of the project. 
 
 “It is the responsibility of authorities concerned to take suggestions from elected representatives. It was not done so far. However, we will check with the civic body,” Vishnu Kumar Raju told TOI.
 
 The present width of the road is 30 ft. The GVMC wants to develop it up to 50 ft with a central median.
 
 GVMC sources said that the improvement of the stretch will ease traffic congestion. It will also facilitate construction of flyovers at Satyam Junction.
