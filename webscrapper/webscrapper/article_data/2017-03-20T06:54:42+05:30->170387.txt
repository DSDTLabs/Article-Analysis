Ahmedabad: Controversy erupted on Sunday after an official of Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary   ( ) demonstrated techniques of copying efficiently in the exam even under monitoring of   cameras. 

 State education minister, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama was left virtually red-faced after coming to know of the incident. He immediately sought explanation from the Godhra DEO, C L Charpot, who was also present at the spot of the deplorable demonstration.
 
 The incident occurred in Godhra at a function of administrative staff of the board, when a member of GSHSEB, identified as Mukesh Pancholi, demonstrated before a gathering comprising students, their parents and teachers on how to copy successfully in the exams.
 
 Pancholi, who was involved in administrative work of the board previously, told that students can get help from teachers in the exams or should peep into answer sheets of other students from certain angles to avoid getting caught in CCTV cameras. He also said that lights of the examination hall can be put off for some time and after taking advantage of it, lights can be turned on again. He went on to say that wires of CCTV can be cut so if any students conduct irregularities it would not be recorded in CCTV cameras.
