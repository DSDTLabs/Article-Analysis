PUNE: While the city is struggling to manage its  ,   and its surrounding localities are   of waste daily.

 The work is being carried out in coordination and collaboration with local politicians, citizens and civic administration.
 
 Former corporators Vanita and Rajendra Wagaskar have been working to ensure that no garbage collected from ward 21, which also includes Koregaon Park, goes to waste. 
 
 Dry and wet waste as well as PET bottles are recycled in four different plants. Initiatives are being taken to increase the capacity.
 
 “The day begins with the segregation of the garbage collected from the locality. It is separated into dry and wet waste, paper and glass or plastic bottles. While the dry and wet waste goes to the respective processing plants, the PET bottles are sent to the recycling plant on North Main Road,” Rajendra said, adding that 16 tonnes of garbage collected from Koregaon Park,   and Tadiwala Road is processed each day.
 
 Paper and glass bottles are sold to scrap collectors. All the activities, Rajendra said, are funded through the corporate social responsibility initiatives of the   and Thermax. Over the past four years, Rs 1.40 crore has been spent to install the recycling units. While the land for the project has been provided by the Pune Municipal Corporation, the operation is being managed by contractors.
 
 Vanita said, “Garbage collected does not leave the area except in one or the other recycled form. We are now working on recycling all kinds of plastic waste into furnace oil as well as other initiatives. Those providing the waste can sell the oil at market cost.”
