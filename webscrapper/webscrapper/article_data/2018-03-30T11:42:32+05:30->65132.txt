  Speaking to us from the sets of the movie, Deepti says, “After Jaguar, I had to wait for a right kind of character to make a back in Sandalwood. I play the role of a psychiatry student, who is very serious to pursue her career. Even in Jaguar, I was a medical student, but it is a different character from my first movie. I know there are other two heroines in the movie, but my role holds significance throughout the movie. I am enjoying my time in Mysuru. The team is co-operative and we are having plenty of fun on the set.”
  
  This is the second time the actress is shooting in Mysuru. “ The city has become like a second home for me. In my first movie, I have shot only at   campus, but this time I shot at various place like shopping mall, Lalith Mahal, on roads and more. I would love to visit   and Palace before I go back to Mumbai.”
