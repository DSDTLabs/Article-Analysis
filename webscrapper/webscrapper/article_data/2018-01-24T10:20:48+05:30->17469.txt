CHANDIGARH: It is 2018, but the problems women face are still centuries old. The fairer sex is still at the receiving end of most ills of society, be it the stares they get for wearing short clothes or the comments they hear for giving birth to a girl.

 To find a way to solve all this, five women who are sole breadwinners of their families, Chandigarh MP  , and skiing champion   got together for a TOI   on Tuesday morning, a day before National Girl Child Day.
 
 
 As was anticipated, the event turned out to be a platform where inspiring life journeys were exchanged and conversation meandered towards how society, especially men, need to change their mindsets towards women, especially those who work, live alone, and are single-handedly raising children.
 
 The event started with each breadwinner sharing her life story and the problems she faces. Those who participated included Suman, a homeguard volunteer whose husband died of a heart attack, and who is now raising her three children alone. Though not much of a social animal,   said she was now working for  , eliciting much-deserved appreciation from Kher.
