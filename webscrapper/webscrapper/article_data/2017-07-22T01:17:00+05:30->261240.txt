A 30-year-old man from Junnar was arrested late on Thursday for allegedly creating a fake profile of   Girish Bapat on a social networking site and uploading   on it.

 The action was initiated after Bapat’s media adviser lodged a complaint with the cyber cell last month, leading to an FIR against the suspect with the Bund Garden police on Thursday. Investigations by the cyber crime cell revealed that the suspect,   of Dholwad village in Junnar taluka, had created Bapat’s fake profile on Facebook in May. 
 
 “Nalawade claims he created the fake profile out of his affection for the leader. He also claims to have keen interest in politics with his wife, a schoolteacher, interested in contesting elections for graduates’ constituency,” said Radhika Phadke, inspector of the cyber crime cell. “He has also created fake profiles of about 15 people, including that of his relatives.”
 
 On Friday, Nalawade, who was arrested under IPC Section 500 (defamation) and Section 66 (C) of the IT Act, was produced before a local court, which granted him bail.
