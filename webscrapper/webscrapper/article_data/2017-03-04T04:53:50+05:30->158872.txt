ROHTAK: More than two years after registration of a case in the   incident, a local court on Friday acquitted all the three   after finding them innocent.

 Sisters Pooja and Aarti, then students of Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA), had become an overnight sensation in 2014 after a video that showed them beating up three youths they claimed were harassing them on a moving   Roadways bus was circulated online. The sisters from Haryana were hailed as ‘bravehearts’. The instance had red-flagged the issue of safety of women.
 
 While giving the verdict, additional chief judicial magistrate Harish Goyal observed, “There is no material which can be used to frame charges against the accused in the case. Hence discharged.”
 
 The Haryana government had even decided to award the girls for their bravery, but backtracked when some passengers on the bus claimed that the fight was over a seat on the bus and the boys had not molested them. Subsequently, a case was registered on November 28, 2014, against the trio of Mohit, Deepak and Kuldeepunder IPC sections of outraging modesty of women and voluntarily causing hurt.
