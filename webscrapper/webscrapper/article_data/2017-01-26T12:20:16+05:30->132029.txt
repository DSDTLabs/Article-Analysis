 Police officer S Baskaran of Tuticorin had filed the case before the Madurai bench. He said that he is one of the police officers involved in the killing of the forest brigand. To honour the officers, the government gave them accelerated promotion.
 
 However, he was given a post, instead of the post that the government wanted him to have. Following it, the government passed a reversion order.
 
 Challenging it, he filed a case before the high court bench in 2009, saying that without issuing a notice to him, the government passed the order.
 
 After hearing, the court passed an order on March 14, 2016, setting aside the government order and also remitting back the matter to the home secretary for fresh considera tion. Accordingly , the home secretary on December 2, 2016, issued a show-cause notice to the officer, seeking his explanation. Challenging it, the officer filed the case.
 
 Justice S Vaidyanathan heard the case. The petitioner's lawyer said that once the order has been set aside by the court, the govt official had no business in asking explanation.
 
 But, the judge said that the petitioner's submission could not be accepted. It is open to the home secretary and director general of police to pass appropriate orders on the explanation of the petitioner, the judge said.
