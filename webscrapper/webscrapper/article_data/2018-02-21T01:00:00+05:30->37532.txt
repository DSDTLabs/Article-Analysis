After debuting in Bollywood with 'Yaariyan' (2014), former Miss India   is seen as an IT professional in the recently-released ' '. Speaking about the film, Rakul shares, “'Aiyaary' has struck a chord with those who understand how the system works. People have appreciated my work, especially in the scene in which Manoj (Bajpayee) and I have emoted through our eyes, without any dialogues. It’s challenging to hold your ground when you are acting alongside a seasoned actor like him.”

 Ask her why it took her four years to sign her second Hindi film and she replies, “I had signed a few films in the South after 'Yaariyan' released. I have been working with A-list actors there. So, I wanted something that was worth staying away from the core market that Telugu cinema has become for me. I’d rather be a star in one industry than be a struggler in another. Fortunately, Aiyaary happened and working with  ,   and Manoj has been a great experience.” The actress is now looking forward to begin shooting for her next with  , in which she will be seen in a different avatar. “I can’t talk much about this project. All I can say at this point is that it’s a meaty character. I will be seen in a commercial role and this opportunity will allow me to showcase my versatility,” she maintains.
 
 However, it’s not just acting that is keeping the self-confessed workaholic occupied. Rakul also owns a chain of international fitness studios. She says, “Fitness, food and films are the three Fs in my life. It’s not just an attempt to make money; I am passionate about them. It gives me immense satisfaction when people tell me that they have been able to lose weight after working out in my studios.”
