NAGPUR: Paverwel, a remote village based in the hilly terrain in Naxal-affected  , was finally electrified on Sunday by the   following prolonged pursuing of the matter by sub-divisional police officer   of Pendhri camp based at Karwafa.

 Gadchiroli police claimed in a press note that SDPO Ingle had come to know of the problem of the tribal population of the village during a ‘gram bhet’ or village visit. During ‘gram bhet’, the police officers are supposed to meet the villagers and record their issues, grievances and problems. The villagers had expressed their grievances regarding absence of power supply.
 
 Ingle then started correspondence with MSEDCL regarding the electrification of the village which is also considered a hub of Naxalites. Apart from its remoteness, the hilly terrain was also one of the challenges the MSEDCL faced to electrify the tribal hamlet.
 
 The villagers are learnt to have expressed their gratitude to the police for helping them get power supply at last.
