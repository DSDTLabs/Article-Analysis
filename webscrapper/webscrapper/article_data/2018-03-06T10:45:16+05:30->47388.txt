NEW DELHI:   today paid tribute to revolutionary Spanish-language writer   on his 91st birth anniversary.

 
 The vibrant   is a nod to Marquez's vivid and riveting writing style, which is best exemplified in his novels like "Love in the Time of Cholera" and "One Hundred Years of Solitude".
 
  
  
 
 'Gabo', as Marquez was affectionately called, was a proponent of 'magic realism', a literary genre that combines more conventional storytelling forms with picturesque, layered fantasy. He was awarded the   Prize for Literature in 1982, becoming the first Colombian writer (and the fourth Latin American) to be conferred the honour.
 
 Marquez was born in the town of Aracataca,   on March 6, 1927, and grew up with his maternal grandparents. He went on to become a journalist, a profession which honed and inspired him as a writer of fiction. He began alternating between journalism and fiction in the late 1950s, a time preceded by years of political instability and civil unrest in Colombia.
 
 "My books couldn't have been written if I weren't a journalist because all the material was taken from reality," Marquez once said.
 
 He wrote his first novella "Leaf Storm" in 1955 when he was 27 years old, and made his mark in the fields of poetry, short story writing and screen writing.
 
 The beloved writer was diagnosed with cancer in the late 1990s and passed away in   on April 17, 2014 at the age of 87.
