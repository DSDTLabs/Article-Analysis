JAIPUR: The three candidates nominated by the   for   seats from the state, will file their nominations at the Rajasthan legislative assembly on Monday.

 On Sunday, the state BJP surprised all by announcing Madan Lal Saini’s name as the third candidate for Rajya Sabha, after Bupender   and Kirori Lal Meena. Saini’s name was announced by CM Vasundhara Raje and given the fact that he is not a strong public leader and that speculations of BJP to field a Rajput candidate were strong, Saini’s name was unexpected.
 
 
 75-year-old Saini’s name was proposed by Raje. By this move, the state party leadership has not only attempted to strengthen its support among the OBCs in the state but also win back the support of its workers. ``Saini will now be seen as the perfect example of a grassroots level worker, who was awarded for his years of hard work,’’ admitted a senior party leader.
 
 Known for his simplicity and someone who comes to the party office using public transport, Saini has held posts like general secretary of the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh and chairman of the state party’s disciplinary committee in the past.
 
 Saini arrived at the BJP headquarters to a rousing welcome on Sunday evening. ``I am greatly honoured. I not only thank my seniors including CM Raje and PM   but also the party workers who have supported me. They would all be glad that one among us have been given this chance,’’ said Saini. He had twice contested from the Lok Sabha seat of Jhunjhunu in 1991 and 1998 but lost. Saini along with Yadav and Meena will file the nomination papers on Monday. National general secretary Yadav arrived in Jaipur on Sunday. ``Three sets of nominations for each of the three candidates have been prepared. They will file them in the presence of at least 90 MLAs,’’ said minister Rajendra Rathore.
