AHMEDABAD: Three crucial payloads for   were flagged off from the   (SAC) recently. These include the  ,   and lander hazard detection avoidance camera, which were flagged off by director SAC Tapan Misra. Currently simulations tests on various Chandrayaan-2 components had been going on at Isro centres in Bengaluru, Mahendragiri and Chitradurga, Karnataka. Isro had in fact created artificial ‘lunar craters’ as part of ‘hazard avoidance and landing’ tests at these locations.

 The Rs 800-crore Chandrayaan-2 mission, will be cheaper than Hollywood’s 2014 movie ‘Interstellar’, which cost Rs 1,062 crore ($165 million). Isro’s earlier Mars mission (Rs 470 crore) in 2013 was cheaper than another Hollywood space movie ‘Gravity’ — whose budget was Rs 644 crore or $100 million — made in the same year. India will return to the moon with the ambitious Chandrayaan-2, which includes an orbiter, lander, and a small rover. If all goes well, Chnadrayaan 2 will be the second such landing since the end of the Apollo and Luna era. Isro is planning to land the rover near the south pole of the moon, as it has big rocks that are billions of years old.
