NOIDA: A Noida-based astrologer thinks the family feud in Samajwadi Party is due to a ‘spell’, and has claimed that she knows how to ward it off.

 To do that, the astrologer,   (55), a resident of Sector 20, said that she needed to offer prayers to goddess Durga and lord Shiva for a few days, apart from performing certain other rituals.
 
 It might sound amusing but Sharma is quite serious about her hunch and called the SP Noida president   on Friday to inform him that the chief   Yadav was under the influence of some ‘evil power’ and was being controlled by some close relatives and friends.
 
 The astrologer said that she can perform an 11-day prayer and fix the issue, claiming that in the past she had performed such rituals.
