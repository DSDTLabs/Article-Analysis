NEW DELHI: The change of officials at the Central Bureau of Investigation, including some who were involved in investigations relating to the PNB scam, was part of a routine churn with states requesting repatriation of officers, government sources said.

 
 The Centre agrees to repatriation of officers to the extent possible keeping in mind the needs of states the officials belong to in terms of cadre and the recent changes were no different and won’t have a bearing on ongoing probes.
 
 Joint director   was repatriated to Tripura on request of CM   who is looking to shore up administration after taking charge. Another officer of the same rank, Nina Singh, was repatriated to Rajasthan. Her husband   was recently moved out of NHAI and sent to Rajasthan.
 
 Under Rajiv Singh’s supervision, in the last four months, CBI’s   registered over 40 cases related to bank frauds against Rotomac, Simbhaoli Sugars and other big names while a preliminary enquiry was initiated against   CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar. Two other officers, R Gopal Krishna Rao (SP) and DIG Anish Prasad, were also repatriated to Tripura.
