PUNE: Unchecked dumping of construction waste in open plots and vacant areas along the rivers has now reached epic proportions. But the   has no concrete plan to deal with building waste with its proposal for a   to treat the debris yet to take off.

 Sources in the civic body said the proposal has been sent to the divisional commissioner’s office which will send it to the state government for approval. The civic body will not be able to start the facility till the government and other approvals are in hand.
 
 Plans are to start a facility in   village which can treat about 250 MT of construction waste every day. The recycled material can be reused for building footpaths and made into bricks. 
 
 Civic officials said the proposal was sent to the commissionerate two months ago. “We are following up the matter with the officials. The civic administration can initiate more steps only after the proposal is routed to the state government and approved,” officials said.
 
 The city is estimated to generate 200-250 MT of construction waste every day. The solid waste department officials said no study to map the construction waste has been conducted, so far.
