COIMBATORE: Three   on the Trichy Road in Coimbatore were gutted after   stored in a garment outlet caught fire on Monday morning. No causalities were reported. 

 Around 9.40am, workers at the Indo Car Designers on the Trichy Road heard the sound of crackers. Soon they saw smoke emanating from the nearby garment outlet and realised that the fire had spread to their own shop and a neighbouring tyre showroom. 
 
 The workers informed police and fire and rescue services. 
 
 "It took five fire tenders and an hour to put out the fire," said inspector of the   police station V Selvaraj. 
 
 "All three shops have been gutted. We have confirmed that the fire spread because of the crackers," he said. 
 
 The garment outlet sold crackers during Diwali last year, police said. "They had obtained licence for the same. However, they had kept the unsold stock stored in the same place. It is not clear how the crackers caught fire," Selvaraj said.
