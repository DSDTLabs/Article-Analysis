BENGALURU:  's first half strike fired   to their first home win in three games, their second on the bounce, as they snapped ATKâ€™s three match unbeaten streak with a 1-0 win on Sunday. With the win, the JSW-side climbed onto the summit of the   table with 18 points while   remained static at seventh.

 There was a distinct feeling of nostalgia at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium as the away side lined up with three former BFC players - Shankar Sampingiraj, Keegan Pereira and Robin Singh.
 
 Both teams struggled to find rhythm in a start-stop match. The visitors produced the better of the chances early on as Gurpreet Singh Sandhu was forced to make a last-ditch save from a Zequinha cross in the 18th minute. Eight minutes later, a loose ball from Rahul Bheke had Zequinha again sending in a cross and this time, Robin, failing to notice Robbie Keane steaming in behind him, headed it on allowing the defenders to smother the situation.
 
 Having failed to break the opposition down, Chhetri came infield from the left channel while Udanta Singh took on a more withdrawn role and Edu Garcia moved slightly wider on the other side.
 
 Now asking different questions, ATK failed to find answers and paid the price five minutes before the break when Conor Thomas, in a momentary lapse of concentration, found the Indian captain, who had been causing problems in his central role, just outside the box. Never one to shy away from taking a strike, the 33-year-old took a touch and drove the ball into the net for BFC's first goal from outside the box in the  .
