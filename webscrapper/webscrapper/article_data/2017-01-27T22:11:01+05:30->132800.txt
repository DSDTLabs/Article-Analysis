JAIPUR: The   finally reconstituted the   and   under chief minister Vasundhara Raje to review cases related to atrocities against Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), on Friday.

 BJP MLAs Arjun Lal Garg (Bilara, Jodhpur), Prem Chand Bairwa (Dudu, Jaipur), Laxminarian Bairwa (Chaksu, Jaipur), Ram Chandra Suneriwal (Dag, Jhalawar), Shimla Bawri (Anupgarh, Sriganganagar), Khemaram Meghwal (Sujangarh, Churu), Kunjilal Meena (Bamanwas, Sawai Madhopur), Pratap Lal Bhil (Gogunda, Udaipur) and Gautam Meena (Dhariawad, Pratapgarh) have been made the committee members.
 
 The committee was required to be formed as per the amended rules, notified by the Centre on April 14, 2016, under the SC and ST (prevention of atrocities) Act, 1989. The rules provide that the high-power committee, which can have maximum 25 members, has to include state's home minister, finance minister, minister in-charge for welfare of SC/ST, all siting MPs and MLAs from SC and ST communities, chief secretary, home secretary, DGP and directors/deputy directors of national commissions for SC and ST.
 
 As per its reply to the high court in April 2016, the state last constituted the vigilance and monitoring committee in September 2012. The amended rules, however, make it mandatory for the state-level committee to meet at least twice a year (January and July) to review implementation of provisions of the SC and ST (prevention of atrocities) Act, 1989 and ensure speedy justice to victims.
 
 Rajasthan topped the list with highest number of cases registered under Prevention of Atrocities Act against SCs and STs between 2013 and 2015, as per figures tabled in a meeting headed by Union Social Justice and Empowerment minister Thawar Chand Gehlot in December 2016. Jaipur-based Centre for Dalit Rights (CDR) said majority of atrocities against the Dalits and Adivasis in Rajasthan were related to land disputes. The state also has a low conviction rate, barely touching a two-digit figure, in SC/ST cases.
