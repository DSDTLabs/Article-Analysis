MUMBAI: The negative effects of demonetisation are clearly behind for leading consumer goods major   ( ), which reported a 4% jump in volume growth during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017, as compared with a 4% dip in volumes in the previous sequential quarter.

 Exceeding expectations, HUL posted a 6% rise in net profit at Rs 1,183 crore in the last quarter of fiscal 2016-17 from Rs 1,114 crore in the corresponding quarter of FY 2015-16. The increase came on the back of 6.4% growth in total income to Rs 8,969 crore (from Rs 8,430 crore). This was largely aided by stabilisation of input costs, a broad-based growth across categories and ‘premiumisation’, which led to a growth rebound in personal care — a category that contributes 46% to the company’s sales.
 
 The company said consumer sentiment has improved and input costs remain stable in the near term. However, wholesale trade of HUL, which covers 9 million outlets, has not yet reverted back to normalcy after demonetisation.  , MD & CEO, HUL, said, “There will be a channel resetting and we believe the contribution of wholesale would come down. P B Balaji, CFO, HUL, said the net benefits on taxation following the implementation of GST would be passed on to consumers. Harish Manwani, chairman, HUL, said, “With gradual improvement in market conditions, we remain optimistic about the mediumterm outlook for our sector.”
