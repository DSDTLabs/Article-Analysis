 is in the news for a ‘heavy’ issue these days — he has put on a few kilos. In a day and age when an actor’s six-pack abs and style quotient draw even more attention than his work, it’s not surprising that Vivian’s weight gain is being talked about. 

 However, the actor says, “It is my weight. When I shed a few kilos, nobody spoke about it. So why are they commenting when I am gaining weight? In television, you don’t act with your weight, you act with your face. As far as my weight is concerned, I am not made of plastic; it’s natural to gain and lose a few kilos. To begin with, people have to understand that sexy does not mean six-pack abs and a good physique. There are many other things that add to a man’s personality. You can gain weight and still be sexy.” 
 
 Prod him a bit about his sudden weight gain and he explains, “I was playing football recently, when I injured my shin. Post that, I could not even run. I was the first person to realise that I am putting on weight, so it’s not like I am not looking after myself. I am recovering from my injury,” he signs off.
