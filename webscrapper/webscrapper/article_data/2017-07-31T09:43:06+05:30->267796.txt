LUCKNOW: An anti-encroachment drive squad found Rs 40,000 wrapped in a polythene bag inside a street vendor’s cart, on Sunday. The packet was found when the ceased goods were dumped in the Lucknow Municipal Corporation’s godown. The   workers found 190   of Rs 100   and the rest of the money in old   notes of Rs 500 and 1,000.

 When the officials went back to Parivartan Chowk, the spot where the drive was carried out, they found an old  . “He was trying to find something and was asking rickshaw pullers and street vendors about a packet and when we asked him, it was revealed that the cash found belonged to him—he had hidden the packet in a cart without telling the vendor,” said Ashok Singh, incharge of Zone I and member of the anti-encroachment task force.
 
 Asking him specific questions, the LMC workers confirmed that the packet actually belonged to the beggar, who is known as Sardar ji. He knew exactly how much money was there and in which denomination.
 
 “When we asked him about the source of the money, he swore he hadn’t stolen it and said it’s his saving of around 10 years. He said he used to work at a puncture shop but later turned to begging outside the Hanuman temple opposite CDRI,” said another officials who was part of the drive. The money was returned to the man.
