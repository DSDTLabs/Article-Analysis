PANAJI: Black Manipuri earthenware is no novelty at the annual 10-day  , but growing demand over the years has urged Manipur-based   alias ‘Pam’ to brave hardships of transporting the fragile goods all the way from the north-eastern state to Goa.

 This range of black-coloured earthenware with a contemporary look are a product of the tribal heritage of the   village of Manipur. The vessels are made using weathered rock and black serpentine rock, which Pam says are indigenous to Longpi.
 
 Slightly sturdier than the regular earthenware, the Longpi vessels are heat-resistant and can be directly put on the stove or in the microwave. The cookware range is priced upwards of Rs 1,200, while cups and bowls are priced at Rs 150.
 
 “Eating out of earthen vessels has health benefits. Having natural stone as one of the ingredients has added benefits as weathered rock contains naturally occurring iron,” Pam says.
 
 To transport her wares, she hires a truck from Longpi village to  . Thereafter, she travels by train to Kolkata and then to Goa. “It is always a cumbersome task to transport these fragile items to Goa. But we don’t mind coming all the way to sell these goods that are a reflection of the heritage of the Manipuri tribe.”
