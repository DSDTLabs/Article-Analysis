NEW DELHI: Two men jailed by the Speaker for throwing pamphlets in   were grilled by the Delhi HC on Monday. 

 Why were you behaving like Bhagat Singh? Is this not a free country yet? What were you inviting attention to? Why were you recreating what   did," a bench of Justices   and   asked the two men during the hearing of their plea against Assembly Speaker  's order sending them to 30 days of rigorous imprisonment.
 
 The court also questioned the maintainability of their plea against the Speaker's June 28 decision as it was a habeas corpus petition and it did not assail the rules under which they were sent to jail for "breach of privilege and contempt of the House." 
 
 Both have challenged the Speaker's order sending them to jail for throwing pamphlets and sloganeering in the House.
 
 HC said if the petitioners do challenge the very constitutional validity of the rules then the plea may have to be heard by a different bench and gave them time till Tuesday to decide their future course of action.
