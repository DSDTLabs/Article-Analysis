NAGPUR: 14-year-old Himanshu Vaidya, a Std VII student, was found hanging from a nail on the kitchen wall with the tag of the I-card around his neck on Thursday. He was suffering from a congenital eye problem.

 As of now, the police department has labelled it as a playful trick that went wrong. However, but a lot of questions remain unanswered. 
 
 There was nothing to indicate that Himanshu, whose father had died three years ago, would take the extreme step. His school was closed for vacations and he was playing with friends earlier in the day from whom Himanshu had even collected some cash to purchase a cricket ball for the evening game. 
 
 Himanshu’s family is clueless on what would have driven him to take such a step. He was good at studies too. Himanshu grew up at his maternal grandparents’ place. His mother Kirti worked at a private hospital. 
 
 The family members claimed that no one had scolded Himanshu in the last few days. He did not even have a fight with friends. 
 
 Himanshu’s maternal grandmother   and his younger brother Tanmay (10) were the first to spot the body. A stool was placed near Himanshu’s feet. 
 
 Lata initially though Himanshu was standing leaning against the wall. “She even asked Himanshu why he was not opening the door despite repeated knocks. When he did not reply, she noticed his feet were in the air. At this point, she raised an alarm,” said a family member. 
 
 At the time of the incident, Himanshu was alone at home as Tanmay had gone to a salon along with Lata. Tanmay was the first to return but he could not enter the house as there was no response despite repeated knocks. Lata tried to enter from the backdoor but that was bolted from the inside. The family finally alerted police.
 
 Himanshu was shifted to the   (GMCH) where he was declared dead. Police have found no suicide note. A case of accidental death has been registered at   police station.
