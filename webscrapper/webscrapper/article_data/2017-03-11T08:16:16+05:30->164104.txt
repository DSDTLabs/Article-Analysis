HYDERABAD: The   has discontinued seven academic electives and 34   for class 11 and 12 from the academic year 2017-18. The decision to scrap the subjects was taken following low enrolment. 

 The circular issued on Thursday, however clarified that "students pursuing these subjects currently in class 11 shall continue with them in class 12 in the session 2017-18 and shall appear in the same subject in class 12 examinations as per the senior secondary curriculum for the session 2017-18." 
 
 The elective and vocational subjects were started by the board in 2014-15 with the aim of opening up more career options for students. While the pilot run in 2013-14 on first-come-first-serve basis found overwhelming response, the subjects soon failed to attract students. "Several vocational subjects offered by the board have very few takers," said M Varalakshmi, principal of  . There are more than 100 vocational courses on offer among which only 40 courses have garnered students' interest in the past few years. 
 
 The electives discontinued by the board are philosophy, creative writing and translation studies, heritage craft, graphic design, human rights and gender studies, theatre studies and library and information sciences. Some of the vocations subjects withdrawn by the board include bakery, music aesthetics, music production, poultry products and technology. 
 
 Some stakeholders are of the opinion that shortage of teachers also posed as a challenge for several schools to run vocational subjects discontinued by the board, which could have been a reason for the poor response.
