She might be just 22, but she is way too mature for her age.   Kapoor’s wife  , who gave birth to a beautiful baby, last year, is back in shape post pregnancy and is looking like a million bucks.

 Recently, the star wife was spotted attending an event on Women’s Day where she gave the audience some insights into her pregnancy and losing weight the healthy way.
 
 Here’s what   had to say:
 
  
  
 
 “I had a tough pregnancy and I went through those five months of a difficult time to bring my daughter into this world. So now I want to spend every moment that I can with her. I wouldn’t want to spend one hour a day with my child and rush off to work. Why did I have her? She’s not a puppy.”
 
 When quizzed about body shaming and how she shed those extra kilos, Mira said, “I think what’s important is to be a healthy mother. Your child is your responsibility. You can take your time to lose that weight. But you need to come to terms with the fact that your body is going to be different for a certain amount of time and it’s not permanent. After that you can set your goal and say I want to get fit.” 
 
 Impressive, isn’t it?
