TRICHY: Members of fishermen associations from six districts including Thanjavur, Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi have commenced an indefinite   condemning the firing on fishermen allegedly by   on March 7 which claimed the life of K Bridjo of Rameswaram. 

 The protesting fishermen gathered at Nagapattinam and began their protest on Monday morning demanding that the Union government secure the release of 88 fishermen and retrieve the 138 trawlers confiscated by the island nation. Though the fishermen from Thankatchimadam in Rameswaram had withdrawn their seven-day protest by accepting the body of K Bridjo, these fishermen from more than 50 coastal villages from the six districts declared that they would continue their fast till their demands were met.
 
 The fishermen sat under a large ‘pandal’ erected in front of the post office in Nagapattinam and raised slogans. Fishermen from Nagapattinam, Jagathapattinam and Kottaipattinam in Pudukkottai skipped their fishing activities and stationed their trawlers at their respective fishing ports.
