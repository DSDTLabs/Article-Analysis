Bhopal: Brace for water rationalization after the erratic and deficient rainfall in the state capital in the next few months.

 Water level in   and Kolar dam that primarily supplies potable water to the city stood at 1661.02 feet and 453.82 metre respectivelyâ€” both well short of the full tank capacity. 
 
 The dead storage level of the two main water bodies 1652 feet for Upper Lake and 432 metre for Kolar dam. 
 
 Kolar dam is about 8 metre short of full-tank level of 462.30 metre. Upper Lake is almost 7 feet short of full-tank level as monsoon in the city is on its last leg. 
 
 BMC officials indicate that water rationing must be started to conserve water for summers. Already large parts of the city connected with Upper Lake water supply are receiving alternate day water supply, admitted an official.
 
 Pressure on Upper Lake for water supply is unlikely to be substituted by Narmada water supply. BMC has around 70% of the old city connected to Narmada pipeline by water supply has not yet been started.
