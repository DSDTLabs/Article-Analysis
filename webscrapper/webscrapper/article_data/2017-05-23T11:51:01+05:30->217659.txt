BHOPAL: Racing against time, the   ( ) kick-started an operation to   ahead of the monsoon on Monday. The action began with two major locations - Hoshangabad road and Arera Colony E-7- on the first day.

 BMC commissioner MP Singh was leading the drive. With the backing of BMC mayor Alok Sharma, the civic body staff also demolished a slab over a major drain. “The construction was illegal and obstructed water passage through the area. Similar widening of the drain, leading up to Arera E-8 extension, would continue in the coming days,” Singh said.
 
 Colonies along the Hoshangabad road were next on BMC’s radar. A narrow drain near Jat Khedi (Ruchi Life) was also cleared using heavy machinery on Monday. Portions of the drain, which were encroached upon by private contractors, also obstructed the water flow, said an official.
 
 The two places, considered low-lying, are not ideal for any construction activity. BMC would soon shift focus to other low-lying areas in Arera Colony, Ashoka Garden, Tilajamalpura and Shahjehabad.
 
 Every ward official has been asked to inspect the prominent markets and localities that reported water-blocking in last monsoon.
 
 The civic body officials also admitted that Mahamai ka Bagh is one of the areas hit by rain water every year. According to experts, reduced sewage inflow into the Patra nullah could lead to less water-blocking. A comprehensive storm water system was never developed in the state capital. BMC has demanded Rs 1,600 crore from the union government for the project.
