HYDERABAD: In the wake of the cleanliness drive taken by   (SCR), there has been a dip in the number of cases imposed on railway passengers for cluttering up tracks, platforms and compartments with junk items like plastic bottles, food packets and paper cups. 

 The statistics of the cases pertaining to littering on railway tracks and platforms, registered by the   (RPF) in the past five years, evinces a 60 per cent decline in the 2017-18 period. So far,   booked around 23,000 littering cases in SCR, which earned close to 45.3 lakh from penalties. Most offenders were caught dirtying A1 and A grade stations, at Secunderabad, Hyderabad, Kacheguda, Tirupati, Lingampalli, Hafeezpet and Khammam. 
 
 "Major stations, where footfall of daily commuters is between over one lakh and 25,000, are cleaner than before. Surveillance has become robust, and we are registering less number of littering cases, but still people need to be sensitized. Sometimes, they evade our eyes and throw junk items on railway premises, mostly tracks, from running trains," said an RPF constable.
 
 "We are carrying out the cleanliness drive in full swing but we need cooperation from people to keep train compartments and railway premises clean," said a railway official.
