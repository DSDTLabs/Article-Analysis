CHANDIGARH: At a time when different factions of the Haryana Congress are trying to prove their clout in the high command, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda surprised many of his rivals by hosting a lunch for senior AICC leaders at his residence in Delhi on Saturday afternoon.

 Hooda refrained from terming it as a political meeting by saying that, “This is our annual programme and we organized a ‘Lohri and   sakranti milan’. Nothing political about it.”
 
 Those associated with the Haryana Congress term it as Hooda and his MP son’s move to show their strength within the party. All this has happened within days after Hooda’s bete noire and Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar’s team had held celebrations. Tanwar’s group had resorted to celebrations amid rumours of a change of guard in Haryana Congress but the AICC asked him to continue as party’s state unit president.
 
 Sources said that except for CLP leader Kiran Choudhary, senior leader Randeep Surjewala and Ashok Tanwar, the lunch was attended by all MLAs, including Kuldeep Bishnoi and his wife Renuka Bishnoi. Among those seen at the lunch included Ahmed Patel, Janardhan Dwivedi, Moti Lal Vora, Kapil Sibbal, Ashwani Kumar and Salman Khurshid. According to those associated with Surjewala, their reason for not attending it was a pre-fixed political meeting at Kaithal. Former Union minister and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja also gave personal programmes as the reason for not making it to the lunch. On the other hand,   was busy in his cycle rally in Yamunnangar. 
 
 “He had invited all leaders. There is really nothing political about it. Since he had been CM for two tenures, hence he enjoys good relations with senior leaders,” said Ran Singh Maan, Hooda’s loyalist and a former chief parliamentary secretary.
