HYDERABAD: The High Court has permitted  , the fourth additional metropolitan sessions judge, Hyderabad (who created a flutter with his resignation minutes after pronouncing his judgment in the   case in April 2018) to take   with effect from May 31, 2018. The state of Telangana has issued a GO notifying of his retirement.

 Reddy was asked to hand over charge to the judge of the economic offences court. Any judge wishing to take voluntary retirement must give authorities 3 months to act on his retirement application. Reddy was not left with three months time to avail this facility. However, since the high court is empowered to waive off shortage of time, the administrative committee of HC judges decided to allow Reddy to avail this facility. The judge of economic offences court was then given full additional charge of all posts that were held by Reddy.
