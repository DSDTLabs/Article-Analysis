BENGALURU: Even cops’ kith and kin aren’t safe from chain snatchers. On Monday morning, two bike-borne miscreants snatched a 70g   chain from a police inspector’s wife in HMT Layout, near  , north Bengaluru, before speeding away.

 Peenya police said Gangamma, wife of Kenche  , an inspector attached to the state police headquarters and resident of HMT Layout, was entering her house when she was attacked at 7.30am.
 
 Footage from the CCTV camera installed at the police inspector’s residence shows the two bike-borne miscreants stopping, and the one riding pillion getting off the bike and walking into the compound of Gangamma’s house.
 
 The miscreant grabbed Gangamma’s gold chain even as she resisted and pulled her for some distance outside the gate. Once the chain was in his hand, he hopped on to the bike and fled.
 
 Kenche Gowda, who was inside the house, came out hearing his wife’s screams and even attempted to chase the culprits for a few kilometres on his bike, but in vain. Gowda later lodged a complaint with Peenya police station. 
 
 While the rider wore a full-face helmet, the one on the pillion wore a cap, a police officer said.
 
 The same chain-snatchers are suspected to have struck earlier at 7am in  , near Bagalgunte, a few kilometres away. There they fled with a 55g gold chain belonging to Soudhamani, a homemaker.
 
 Bagalgunte police said Soudhamani was drawing rangoli in front of her house when she was targeted. 
 
 Police have registered a case and suspect the chain-snatchers could be from the notorious Irani gang.
 
 Police commissioner T   has instructed all police stations to beef up security in the morning and evening to nab chain-snatchers. He has asked additional commissioners of police to monitor implementation of the directive in their respective jurisdictions.
