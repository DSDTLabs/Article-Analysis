 "I quickly applied brakes and the car screeched to a halt. Fortunately, I was driving at a low speed, around 40 kmph. Had the speed been anywhere around 70-80kmph, the car would have hit one of the pillars of the bridge," said the 27-year-old employee of a private company based out of Pune.

 Oil spills are frequent on the expressway, leading to fatal accidents and traffic snarls for hours as well. Anshul Sharma, an IT professional from Pune who travels to Mumbai at least thrice a week, is concerned about the increasing number of accidents on the expressway. 
 
 "Oil spilling from vehicles is a frequent affair. Among the common reasons is overtaking by small vehicles. If the trucks or   take all the three available lanes at an average speed of 20-30kmph, smaller vehicles then overtake those," he said.
 
 "Keeping in mind the rising accidents on the expressway, people from same company or society taking the road frequently have created WhatsApp groups to keep each other informed and seek help in times of distress," he added.
 
  (22), who takes the expressway to Mumbai twice a week, said, "There are numerous occasions when I got stuck in snarls. Recently, I was stuck for around 3 hours on the expressway when a tanker carrying oil had toppled. I was late for a concert as a result."
 
 "I usually call my mother before leaving Pune and after reaching Mumbai as she is worried because of the frequent accidents," she added.
