VISAKHAPATNAM: At early hours of Sunday, around 30 people congregated at the Kambalakonda   for a trek. Held to observe International Day for   (May 22), this three-kilometre trek was a special one. It was organised with the aim to introduce the participants to the diverse flora and fauna found in and around Kambalakonda forest.

 The walk, especially around the lake, focussed on observing varied birds, butterflies, reptiles, insects and trees. Discussions were also held on biotypes, forests, wildlife, conservation, sustainable tourism and biodiversity aspects within the sanctuary. Bird watching being a part of the walk, photography enthusiasts got a chance to capture some unique pictures.
 
 Ch Gnaneshwar, one of the trekkers from Trendsetters Charitable Trust (TCT), said, “For preserving biodiversity, sustainable tourism is very important. In fact, this year’s theme is, ‘Biological diversity and sustainable tourism.’ It includes involving the local communities or tribals and providing them employment. In Kambalakonda too, some former poachers have been given jobs within the park as guards, which has now turned them into protectors of the park.”
 
 Sandhya Parimala Vijapurapu, another member, said, “We saw around 25 species of birds including some uncommon ones such as white bellied sea eagle, white browed bulbul, darter and cinnamon bittern. Besides lapwings, kingfisher and mynahs were sighted too. Around 10 varieties of butterflies including the endemic Solomon Arab butterfly was spotted.
 
  We also observed reptiles such as the garden lizard and   We saw the footprints of a baby porcupine.” Towards the end of the walk, camera trap methods to spot wildlife in their habitat was also demonstrated for the trekkers to see.
