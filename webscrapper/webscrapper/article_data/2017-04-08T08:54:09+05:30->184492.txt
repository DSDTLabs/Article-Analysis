New Delhi: A special court would, on April 10, decide on whether to take cognizance of the charge sheet filed by the   against Himachal Pradesh chief minister   and others for allegedly amassing assets worth around   to their known sources of income. Special judge Virender Kumar Goyal fixed the matter for argument and order on the cognizance of CBI’s final report in the case after the court completed scrutiny of the documents filed by the agency along with the charge sheet.

 The final report, filed against nine people for alleged offences punishable under section 109 (abetment) and 465 (punishment for forgery) of IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act, arrayed around 225 witnesses and 442 documents. Besides the 82-year-old Congress leader and his wife Pratibha Singh, the report arrayed Chunni Lal Chauhan, Joginder Singh Ghalta, Prem Raj, Vakamulla Chandrasekhar, Lawan Kumar Roach and Ram Prakash Bhatia as accused. The report also named as accused LIC agent Anand Chauhan, who is currently in judicial custody.
 
 The matter was transferred by the Supreme Court to the Delhi high court, which on April 6, 2016, had asked the CBI not to arrest Singh. On November 5 last year, the apex court had transferred Singh’s plea from the HP high court to the Delhi high court. PTI
