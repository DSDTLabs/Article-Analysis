PANAJI: As the summer season draws near, the mercury is set to rise during the morning hours. The   rose from 20.8 Celsius on Wednesday to 22.3 Celsius on Saturday, as an indication.

 “There is seasonal transition and over the next few days, the minimum temperature will rise,” scientist at the meteorological centre at  , S D  , said.
 
 While the month of January 2017 was the hottest month since January 2010, with the meteorological centre at Altinho recording a mean maximum temperature of 33.4 Celsius, the temperatures in February have been in the normal range.
 
 But Sanap said that mercury may not rise too sharply in the morning hours nor drop too low either, as in the peak of the mild winter season. 
 
 The minimum temperature had even fallen a degree below normal during the last few days to 20.0 Celsius. 
 
 There will be relief though during the day, as the day temperatures are likely to be within normal range for the next few days. 
 
 “If it does go up, the maximum temperature, which has been within range of 32 Celsius is likely to rise by only about a degree or so during the next few days,” Sanap said.
