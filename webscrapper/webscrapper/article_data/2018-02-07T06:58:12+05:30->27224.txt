BENGALURU: The Centre may have given a green signal to the ambitious Rs 17,000-crore suburban rail network for Bengaluru in the Union budget, but the project is likely to face a problem when it comes to acquisition of a 20-acre land parcel on Bangalore University’s Jnanabharathi campus. 

 While Indian Railways plans to set up a coaching terminal on the BU land, varsity sources said parting with the land won’t be easy. Coaching terminals are crucial for any railway network as they serve as parking and maintenance spaces for trains.
 
  
  
 
 A senior BU official said the university has given away land parcels to various government departments and associated establishments, including the recently inaugurated Dr   (BASE), for which more than 40 acres was allocated on the campus. “In fact, at a meeting six months ago, the BU syndicate took a decision not to allocate any piece of land for non-varsity purposes,” he pointed out.
 
 Established in 1973, BU’s Jnanabharathi campus spans over 1,000 acres and is one of the few surviving lung spaces in the city. After last year’s trifurcation exercise, some postgraduate departments of the parent varsity are being shifted from   premises to Jnanabharathi and the administration needs land to accommodate them. 
 
 “We are in need of land as some of the campus spaces like bio park can’t be disturbed. We can’t say a strict no when the government seeks land for public utilities like suburban rail but the fact remains that the varsity land is shrinking by the day,” said another source in BU.
