KOLKATA: Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed   to register the name of 218 BA and BSc Part I students of   for Women, a government-aided institution, and allow them to appear in the ensuing examination scheduled to begin on March 6. The college authorities had moved court seeking an order directing the university to register and allow them to appear for the examination. 

 Issuing an interim order, Justice   made it clear that the status of these candidates as examinees will finally depend on the outcome of the writ petition. If the ultimate judgment on the petition favours the college, the students will be granted the status of examinees and their results declared. If, however, the judgment goes against the college, it will negate the candidates' status as examinees. The court directed the college principal to make this aspect of the interim order clear to candidates.
 
 The college authorities moved the writ petition challenging CU's February 20, 2018, decision disallowing the 218 students from appearing for the Part I examination. With HC lawyers on cease work, college principal   appeared in person in view of the urgency of the case. 
 
 Bhattacharya submitted that on March 27, 2017 CU had issued a circular asking all colleges to declare their intake capacity and current teachers' strength. But no academic year was mentioned. Bhattacharya submitted the details assuming the circular was for the 2016-17 academic year. The college then found a post in CU's website on May 30, 2017, showing its intake capacity lower than what it actually was. CU did not respond to a letter from the college pointing out this anomaly. 
 
 Appearing for CU, deputy inspector of colleges   outlined three options but Bhattacharya said it would be impossible for the students to meet those conditions at the fag end of the academic year.
