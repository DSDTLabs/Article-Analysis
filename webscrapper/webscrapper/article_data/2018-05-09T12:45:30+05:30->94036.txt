PATNA: State chief secretary   held a meeting with Patna DM Kumar Ravi on Tuesday to discuss ways for development of Kangan Ghat Bhawan for accommodation of Sikh devotees visiting Takhat Shri Harmandir Sahib in Patna City. Ravi said the district administration has been instructed by the state government to find an one acre land for the construction of Kangan Ghat Bhawan.

 
 “Earlier, the administration had selected a location along the banks of the Ganga, but it was cancelled because of the risk of flood. We are now looking for another location near Kangan Ghat, where land is available for acquisition. The construction work will commence as soon as we hand over the land to the state building construction department,” Ravi said.
 
 The DM added the venue will be selected by adhering to rules and conditions of the   under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 for the construction of any building along the banks of the Ganga.
 
 As per Sikh religious text, tenth Sikh Guru  , while playing with other children, threw his ‘kangan’ (bangle) into the Ganga. The gurdwara was thus named Kangan Ghat.
 
 Sources said funds to the tune of Rs 12 crore were sanctioned by the central government in 2016 for development of tourist facilities at Kangan Ghat. The central government had in fact allocated funds to the tune of Rs 100 crore for development of amenities across the country in preparations for yearlong 350th birth anniversary of Guru   in 2017.
