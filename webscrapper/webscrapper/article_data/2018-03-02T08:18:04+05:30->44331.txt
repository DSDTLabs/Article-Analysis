CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has taken a decision to recall 2002-batch IAS officer Baldeo   from the central deputation just after six months of his joining the Union government posting. It was in September last year that Purushartha was appointed as personal secretary to minister of state (independent charge) for housing and urban affairs  .

 Before joining the central government on deputation Purushartha was on deputation with the Chandigarh administration and was serving as municipal commissioner here.
 
 In a recently held meeting, chaired by chief minister Captain  , it was decided to recall Purushartha from the deputation owing to shortage of middle rank IAS officers in the state. The state government would now be sending a communication in this regard to the central government.
 
 However, a senior officer privy to the development told TOI that in fact Purushartha was himself interested in joining back his parent cadre. “In case he himself opts to curtail his deputation period rather than the state government writing to the central government, it would be a problem for the officer to go on central deputation in future,” reasoned the officer requesting anonymity.
 
 Another 1985-batch Punjab cadre IAS officer Arun Goel, who is on deputation with the central government, is also going to join back the Punjab government by next month end. At present, he is working as additional secretary and financial advisor in the Union ministry of labour and employment. He had joined that post in September 2016.
 
 On deputation, Goel had joined as joint secretary in the department of revenue under the Union ministry of finance in June 2012. Later, he also served as vice-chairman of the   ( ) from July 2015 onwards, till he joined the ministry of labour and employment.
