CHENNAI:  , Tamil Nadu’s chaiwallah-turned-leader, has stepped down as chief minister for the third time, continuing to carry the image of a 'puppet chief minister’ warming the seat for others.

 Panneerselvam sent a letter to Tamil Nadu governor Vidyasagar Rao on Sunday stating that he was tendering his resignation owing to personal reasons. This was not totally unexpected from the 65-year-old politician, who has come to be known for his humility and loyalty.
 
 Man Friday of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, OPS first became chief minister in 2001 when Supreme Court barred Jayalalithaa from holding the post. He quit without any fuss after six months when Jaya was ready to take charge. Again he was made chief minister in 2014 when Jaya was convicted in the disproportionate assets case, only to quit seven months later.
 
 This time he was chief minister for only a month, but it could be said that the people saw glimpses of how a OPS, acting alone, would be as TN's CM. With Jayalalithaa no longer around to guide him (back then every file would be vetted Jaya before OPS as chief minister signed them), OPS had to do his job alone with the help of advisers like Sheela Balakrishnan.
 
 OPS attempted to assert himself as CM despite pressure from ministers in his own cabinet urging for Sasikala to become chief minister. Many say that the independence he showed indicated his eagerness to hold on to the chief minister’s post and he lacked political shrewdness to take on his challengers and become a power centre.
 
 In the last three months OPS also managed to get appreciation from opposition parties and is credited with ushering in a new political culture. The recent assembly session passed off smoothly without the usual ruckus or walkout by DMK members.
 
 “He had the BJP’s tacit backing, a large section of cadres were behind him, and even public opinion was in favour of him. But he chose not to take on Sasikala,’’ says an AIADMK functionary.
