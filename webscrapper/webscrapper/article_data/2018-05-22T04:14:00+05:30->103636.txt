Vadodara: Days after minority schools in the city refused admission to some children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, their parents rushed to the office of district education officer (DEO) on Monday to mark their protest. The parents were demanding that the DEO M N Patel to intervene and either ask the school authorities to grant admission to their children on the basis of the admit card issued to them under RTE Act or postpone the dates for submission of form. However, the DEO was not present at the office when hundreds of parents gathered inside and outside the building of DEO office. Seeing large number of parents gathered there, cops from Karelibaug police station had to be deployed so that no untoward incident takes place. Some parents were also claiming that they have been visiting DEO office since past couple of days, but the DEO has not been coming to the office. When TOI tried to contact Patel, he was not available for comments. On the other hand, schools have been claimed that a 2014 ruling of Supreme Court says that RTE Act does not apply to aided or unaided minority schools. The schools are stressing that the district education officials have erred while processing the applications under RTE Act. According to sources, a total of 400 students have been granted admission this year in 20 schools which are running as minority schools.
