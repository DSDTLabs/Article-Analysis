LUCKNOW: After senior SP leader and former minister  , another ex-cabinet minister,  , joined the   on Sunday evening.

 Rai, a close associate of the party patriarch   and former state SP chief Shivpal Yadav, met BSP chief Mayawati on Sunday morning before joining the party in the evening. He also got a ticket to contest from Ballia Sadar assembly constituency. Rai, who had been denied a ticket by the SP, replaced Ramji Gupta, who was earlier declared as the party candidate by Mayawati. Rai, a two-time MLA from Ballia, said his decision to join BSP was driven by the insult inflicted on Mulayam Singh Yadav by SP president and UP chief minister  . “He (Akhilesh) also insulted me in a manner no one would do to his personal servant,“ said Rai, who was first sacked by Akhilesh from the cabinet and then denied a ticket.
 
 Claiming of starting his political career under socialist leader Janeshwar Mishra, Rai said that he continued to follow the socialist principles, while the present SP leadership only followed Facebook and Twitter. Accusing Akhilesh of conspiring and allowing communal forces to gain ground in UP, Rai said that it was now only Mayawati who can stop the BJP from coming to power. Narad's joining comes more than a week after another SP old guard and former cabinet minister Ambika Chaudhary walked into Mayawati's camp and managed to get a ticket to contest from Phephna assembly constituency in Ballia. Mayawati has so far replaced five party candidates she had announced earlier this month. Before Narad, Ambika replaced Abhiram Singh in Phephna and Mukhtar Ansari edged out Manoj Rai in Mau. Mukhtar's brother and son Sigbatullah Ansari and Abbas Ansari replaced Vinod Rai and Wasim Iqbal from Mohammadabad in Ghazipur and Ghosi assembly seat in Mau district, respectively.
