Chandigarh: Chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday ordered transfer of chief conservator of forests (hills) Harsh Kumar for issuing orders to various project developers in areas of Mohali coming under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) and thus creating confusion.

 He has been transferred as chief conservator of forests (information technology) in Mohali office. Chief conservator of forests (CFC) Saurabh Gupta has now been posted in his place.
 
 Additional chief secretary of forests and wildlife Satish Chandra confirmed, “His transfer orders have been issued after the chief minister took notice as to how the officer had created confusion without consulting the concerned minister.”
 
 Chandra said that the IFS officer was not competent to issue any orders and it is the concerned minister who had to decide whether the PLPA notification was to be extended or not.
 
 The PLPA notification is lapsing for some of the areas in Mohali on February 3, and for some areas on August 28. The IFS officer had written to some of the developers on January 22, that they could go ahead with the eco-tourism development activities in Tarapur village in Mohali as the PLPA notification was going to come to an end in February.
 
 In another communication, the officer had written to some of the developers in Karoran village of Mohali to wait till the PLPA notification comes to an end in August.
 
 Chandra said that the government had been extending the PLPA notification for the past more than 100 years and how can an officer presume that the government would not extend the notification now.
