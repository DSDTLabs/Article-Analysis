 The accused pounced on the teenager when she was walking back home with her pet dog after having a round on the society premises. The suspects came from the rear and gagged her with a cloth.

 The suspects set free the girl and fled after they heard noise of a car entering the basement. The panicked girl went home and narrated the incident to her parents. She was admitted to a private hospital for treatment. The incident came to light after the hospital authorities contacted the police.
 
 “There are CCTV cameras installed in the society, but they do not cover the basement. We have recorded statement of the rape survivor’s father and registered an FIR against the suspects under the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on Monday, Bhalerao said.
 
 “The condition of the girl is stable. We have prepared the sketch of one of the suspects based on the information given by her. We are working on certain clues for arresting the suspects at the earliest,” she added.
