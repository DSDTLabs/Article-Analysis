 DEHRADUN: To stop overcharging by helicopter companies, the state tourism department is going to start online chopper booking facility for   yatra this year.
  
  Garhwal   (GMVN) or   (UCADA) will manage the single portal to facilitate online booking.
  
  Sources said that the move was initiated to control overcharging by the aviation companies. There are 22 registered aviation companies that provide services during Char Dham yatra. During the peak yatra season in May and June, frequent complaints of overcharging are received.
  
  Tourism secretary Dileep Jawalkar said, “The online booking will start before the commencement of Char Dham yatra and all required permissions have been taken. Soon a common centre will also be opened where all the companies will have their counter.” 
  
  Doon resident   said, “Two years ago when I went to visit  , I had to pay Rs 10,000 for a chopper ticket which is otherwise Rs 7000 from Phata. When I asked the in-charge of the aviation company, I was told that demands are high and I would have to wait if I pay normal airfare.”
