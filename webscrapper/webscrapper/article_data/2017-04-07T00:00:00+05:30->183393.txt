Samyuktha shares that she did get many offers post the release of Kirik Party, “but I couldn’t take them up due to personal commitments. But last week, as soon as I returned from Roadies, I got a call from Anish. He narrated the script and I liked it. More importantly,  , whose opinion matters a lot to me, also encouraged me to take it up,” shares Samyuktha. “The film is a romcom and I play a girl called Mahalakshmi, but in no way does my character conform to her name. She is bindaas and someone who you will fall in love with instantly,” she adds. 
 Meanwhile,   concurs that the day he watched Kirik Party he knew he had found his leading lady. “Samyuktha has an infectious energy and it's hard to miss that vibe. She will be apt to play Mahalakshmi as this is an engaging love story that will also be high on entertainment,” sums up the actor.
