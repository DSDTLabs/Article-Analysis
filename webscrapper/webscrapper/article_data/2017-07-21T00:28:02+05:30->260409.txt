Madurai: A resident of Chinnalapatti in Dindigul had a sleepless night on Wednesday after people queued up outside his house around midnight because word had gone around that the rare ``Brahma Kamalam’’ had bloomed in his garden. ``Brahma kamalam’’, meaning Bramha’s flower, belongs to the cactus variety and blooms once a year. 

 S Gandhi of A L S Street in eighth ward of Chinnalapatti town panchayat brought a leaf from the ``Brahma kamalam’’ plant that he had seen in his daughter’s house at Mandya in Karnataka. He planted the plant, scientifically named Epiphyllum oxypetalum and which produces large buds. The fact that Gandhi had it in his house became the talk of the town when a bud started appearing and people making enquiries about its blooming.
 
 It is called Brahma Kamalam as this flower resembles the flower that Lord Brahma holds in one of his four hands. When it looked as though it would open on Wednesday night, people started queueing up outside his house from midnight. Some of them came dressed in their best clothes as they wanted to take a selfie with it.
 
 ``It is believed that seeing a Brahma kamalam in bloom will bring good luck, hence we did not want to miss it and I came with my family,’’ said Parvathy of Chinnalapatti. The owner of the flower was also proud of it and was willing to give the people of his region the benefit of witnessing the flower. The family kept the gate opened and placed the pot in a well-lit place so that everybody could see it.
 
 The flower had begun flowering around 10 p.m, and as it was said to have a very short life of six hours, after which it starts withering. People queued up till 4 a.m on Thursday, when it started fading. ``It was a beautiful flower and we feel lucky to have seen it,’’ said Devi a resident.
