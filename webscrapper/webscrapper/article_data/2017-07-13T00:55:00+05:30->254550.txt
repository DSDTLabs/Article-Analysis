Pune: A 43-year-old man from Khadki was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly filming a woman (39) when she was taking bath and troubling her demanding sexual favours.

 The man was arrested for stalking and abusing the woman. The Khadki police also invoked provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act against the suspect. The police said the suspect and the woman stayed in the same area and knew each other.
 
 The complaint states that the suspect allegedly threatened the woman, saying he would make her photographs and the video clip viral on a social networking site and defame her. He allegedly demanded sexual favours from her thereafter.
 
 The woman initially agreed, but the suspect started abusing her in public and followed her wherever she went. After this, the woman stopped interacting with the suspect, which enraged him. On Tuesday, he allegedly accosted her in a public place and abused her. The woman then approached the police.
 
 Senior inspector Laxman Borate of the Khadki police said the suspect and the woman were married. “Earlier, she stayed in the house of the suspect as a tenant. The suspect had filmed her there without her knowledge,” he said.
