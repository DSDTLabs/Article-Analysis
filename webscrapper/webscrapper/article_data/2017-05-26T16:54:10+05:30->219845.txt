NEW DELHI: The wreckage of the   (IAF) 
  on May 23 has been found, but there is no word on its two pilots.

 The Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jet, which 
  around 60km north-west of the   airbase in  , was found close to its last known position. 
 
 The "air dominance"  , being flown by a squadron leader and a flight lieutenant, took off in a two-aircraft formation sortie from the Tezpur airbase at about 10.30am on May 23. 
 
  
  
 This is the latest in a series of mishaps involving the Sukhoi. The IAF has already lost at least seven of its 240 Sukhoi-30MKIs, which are the latest and the most potent fighters in its combat fleet.
 
 In all, India has contracted 272 twin-seat Sukhois from Russia for over $12 billion, with the bulk of them being "produced under licence" by Hindustan Aeronautics. 
 
 Overall, the armed forces have lost over 60 aircraft and helicopters in crashes, which have killed over 80 people, just since 2011.
