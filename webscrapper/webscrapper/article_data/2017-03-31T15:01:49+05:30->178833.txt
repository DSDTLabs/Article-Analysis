NEW DELHI: The   today directed 
  to respond to 
  in four weeks, and when he said he wouldn't unless his judicial work is restored to him, the court asked him if he was mentally fit.

 "If you feel you are not mentally fit to answer the queries of court, you give us a medical certificate," said Chief Justice JS   to the Kolkata judge who's facing contempt proceedings for making allegations of bias against   colleagues as well as against the Supreme Court.
 
 As the SC bench rose to leave, 
  loudly declaimed that he wouldn't again appear before the top court. It was unclear whether he would 'never' appear in the SC or would never appear in the SC 'on this matter'. The Kolkata Judge then told the media that he's going to "pass an order against" the seven-judge SC bench hearing his case.
 
 Just before that,   also dared the SC to punish him again saying he won't appear again unless his judicial work is restored. 
 
 The apex court refused to agree to restore the Kolkata judge's judicial work to him and told him he's free to engage a lawyer to defend himself. Justice Khehar asked him more than once if "is mentally fit to understand the gravity of the contempt proceedings."
 .
 During the hearing Attorney General (AG)   said that Justice Karnan was perfectly aware of what he was saying and doing.
 
 The Chief Justice however told the AG "we can see his (Justice Karnan) state of mind is not clear and he is not able to comprehend what exactly he is doing."
 Earlier this month, the SC had issued a bailable warrant against Justice Karnan to secure his presence in the court on the next date of hearing, which is today, March 31. 
 
 That was the first and so far only time that a sitting judge of the higher judiciary faced contempt proceedings and the apex court has been forced to issue a warrant against a judge.
