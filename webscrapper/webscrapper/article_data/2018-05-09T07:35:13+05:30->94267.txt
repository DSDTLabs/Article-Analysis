PATIALA: Patiala MP   has termed  's demand for the Union government to intervene and save the Ravi-Beas waters, a ruse to barter the state's interests. 

 
 The suspended member of AAP, Gandhi, said, "First the handing over of the security of the state jails to the central forces, and now seeking central intervention to protect  's waters point out that the CM was surrendering the state's interests to the Centre. 
 
 "It seems that the CM has forsaken federalist demand of Punjab's riparian rights over its own waters and is walking down the path of former   that led to the suppression of the voice of the people."
 
 Gandhi said he smelt a conspiracy in the letter written to Amarinder by the Haryana CM, which was followed by the statement by the former, demanding central intervention.
