Filmmaker   feels satisfied looking at the biopic he’s made on  . The film that dwells on the life and times of dreaded gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s sister wasn’t easy for him to pull off. Apoorva says, “I was expected to meet Haseena and her family at someone’s place in Malad at 7 pm. I was shooting 'Zanjeer' at Film City at that time and reached the venue at 9 pm. Kadir, who was always with her, told me, ‘Aapko maalum hai aapne kisko intezar karwaya hai?’” 

 The meeting went off well and the film eventually took off after she signed an NOC, officially permitting the filmmaker to document her life on reel. However, Apoorva insists he has not made a film glorifying his subject. “I had told Haseena Parkar that after talking to her, I will be talking to several others and basis of what I lay my hands on, I will draft the narrative. We will put in everything that can be corroborated which her family and she agreed with,” says Apoorva, adding, “It’s such a dichotomy: she was Nagpada’s godmother and a gangster in the eyes of the law. The judge, during her hearing had noted that it’s difficult for anyone to say if she’s a victim of circumstances or the smartest woman on earth.”
