 The regulatory authority after hearing the case ordered that the brochures printed before implementation of RERA cannot be treated as legal entity.
 
 A D Kapaley, member of the state regulatory authority said, "In RERA there is a condition that facilities mentioned in brochures and pamphlets should be fulfilled by builder otherwise he will be bound for legal action. But amenities promised in brochures before implementation of RERAcannot be considered as legal entity or else there should be an official agreement between builder and customer."
 
 As per the rule, every registered project needs to be updated every quarter with all latest development and pictures on the website. Failing to comply with the rule may invite action from regulators. Sunil Agrawal, a builder said, "Builders should fulfil all the promises made to customers verbally or on papers. Registration under RERA should not be the deciding factor for taking action against the nonfulfillment."
