MUMBAI: Bombay   on Thursday said   cases cannot be   just because it is now “inconvenient” for the victim. A division bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Anuja Prabhudessai dismissed an application filed by Andheri businessman Hitendra Panchal (39) alias Harish Khan, who had sought striking down of kidnap and rape charges against him. Panchal had claimed that the 20-year-old girl had no objection if the criminal   was dropped.

 Panchal’s advocate told court the FIR at Amboli police station had been lodged over a misunderstanding. The girl had now got married to another man and she had not revealed the case to him. The lawyer said she did not want to pursue the case as she did not want her husband or in-laws to find out.
 
 The court refused to interfere with the criminal case. “All that the victim has said is that it is not convenient for her to pursue the case. That is no grounds for quashing a serious case like rape. Hence the application is rejected,” said the court.
 
 The girl, who had gone went missing from her house, subsequently returned. The FIR alleged that she had been kidnapped and raped, and Panchal was arrested. A sessions court released him on bail, after she filed an affidavit that she did not have any objection. Panchal recently urged the HC to use its discretionary powers to quash the case, as there was an out-of-court settlement.
 
 Additional public prosecutor F R Shaikh opposed the application and said police had filed a chargesheet. The HC has allowed rape cases to be quashed on the basis of a settlement. In this case, it said the terms of settlement had not been placed before it.
