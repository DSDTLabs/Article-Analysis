For Laksshya, I have been a father and a mother. Actually, let me rephrase it – for him I am someone who is there by his side all the time. I even take him to my shoots – I hope he likes it that way. I am often asked: “Do you think he misses a mom”? I don’t think so. Because he has one – Me! I have done everything for him, including buying clothes, changing nappies, cleaning, bathing and burping him or feeding – I am a master in mothering! 

 As a ‘mom-dad’, I was lucky because as a baby, he didn’t cry much at night (fingers crossed), woke up for his feed and then slept again. It’s a blessing I have been told. My life is my son. My routine revolves around his timetable. At this age, I have set a curfew for myself – be back home before the baby sleeps and wake up with him. And I am loving it! 
 
 
 
 
 After having Laksshya, the one stereotype I have broken is that one needs to be a sada suhaagan (married) to have children. If you are sure about it and mature enough to handle the responsibilities – I say, go for it. But being a single parent is basically juggling being a mom or dad. On some days, I am a very soft-natured mom. When the situation arises that I have to be strict, the dad in me takes over! All in all, I am a good balance. But unlike most dads, I am much more hands-on. Although, I have help at home, I prefer to do as much as I can myself. I bond with him over colouring books, identifying animals in the charts and on play dates. 
 
 Recently, I had great fun with him at a pre-school mom-child activity. Laksshya and I had a ball. It’s a myth that in parenting everything has to be perfect. If you are bringing up your child in a loving, compassionate environment, you are doing fine. 
 
 So, happy Mother’s Day to me! But I don’t believe in these days... Haven’t ever wished my parents and I don’t want Laksshya to do it as well. But I am excited about his birthday, which is around the corner.
