WASHINGTON: Young people still prefer curling up with a paper book over  , even more so than their older counterparts, according to a study which dispels the stereotype that millennials are always hooked to technology.

 
 The study, published in the journal  , found that adult consumers across all age groups perceive ownership of   very differently than ownership of physical books, and this could have important implications for those in the business of selling digital texts.
 
 “We looked at what’s called psychological ownership, which is not necessarily tied to legal possession or legal rights, but is more tied to perceptions of ‘what is mine’,” said  , an associate professor at   in the US.
 
 Peoples’ sense of psychological ownership is affected by three primary factors: whether they feel like they have control over the object they own, whether they use the object to define who they are, and whether the object helps give them a sense of belonging in society, said Helm.
 
 Researchers convened four focus groups in different age ranges: one of Baby Boomers; one group of Generation X and two of millennials. Participants described being more emotionally attached to physical books, and said they use physical books to establish a sense of self and belonging, while the e-book experience feels more like renting.
