VISAKHAPATNAM: Two out of three chimpanzees housed at the   escaped from their enclosure on Friday morning. However, zoo authorities caught the chimpanzees and placed them back into their enclosure nearly 45 minutes after the incident occurred.

 According to zoo officials, the chimpanzees - Chiko (male, 18 years) and Chikitha (female, 30 years) - made their way out of the enclosure at around 9.50 am by crossing the solar fencing.
 
 Noticing the chimpanzees, animal keeper G Chinna Rao alerted the zoo officials, who along with emergency response team rushed to the spot along with required tranquilizing equipment. The zoo keepers tried to lure the chimpanzees with fruits, but the primates didn't return to the enclosure. Subsequently, Chikitha was tranquilized and brought back to the night kraal. Later, Chiko followed Chikitha back into the kraal on its own. Zoo officials said that all the chimpanzees are safe and healthy.
 
 Zoo sources said that the chimpanzees had managed to scale the enclosure using a water-pipe. The solar fence was not functional when the incident occurred. The chimpanzees were brought from a zoo last year in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Mumbai by air and then from Mumbai to Vizag by road.
