KANNUR: The forest authorities are in the process of installing   in   here to record the   and their movement pattern. A tiger and a herd of wild dogs were spotted recently in the sanctuary.

 “Though there was indirect evidence about the presence of tiger in the sanctuary, it was quite recently that we spotted it and also our team members were able to photograph it. If we install camera traps, which are motion-activated cameras that can take pictures of animals without causing any disturbance to them even during night, we may be able to document the animal variety here,” said Sajikumar V, wildlife warden. He said one unit comprises two cameras and the plan is to install 10 such units in the sanctuary.
 
 “This way, we will be able to spot the movement of wild animals, their territories and also the population,” said the wildlife warden.
 
 He added that herds of wild dogs were also spotted. The pattern of the local migration and territories of animals can also be studied using the camera trap, he said, adding that no formal survey of the population of tigers has been held here so far.
 
 According to officials, though the presence of tiger was felt earlier too, as there were a couple of instances of it hunting preys there, this case of spotting it directly underscores the relevance of improving the infrastructure there. 
 
 The wild cat was spotted near Meenmutti area of the sanctuary, nearly 15km inside the forest. There were 10 wild dogs in the herd, and they are seen very rarely in the forest areas, according to forest officials, who said people often mistake them for wolves.
 
 Even a rescue shelter for the aged animals can be set up in the forest area so that old animals can be rehabilitated there, said an official.
 
 According to forest officials, the forest fire in   wildlife sanctuary has affected the wildlife there and there is a local migration taking place to other places.
