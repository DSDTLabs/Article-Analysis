PANAJI: A series of violations ranging from approval of projects despite lack of minimum six-metre road access to non-adherence of setback rules were found after an inspection of two construction sites in Merces, on Thursday.

 The same builder was constructing at both sites, one at Morombi O Pequeno, Mestabhat and the other at Murda,  . The inspection was held following   (MMWA) and some activists complaining about the violations.
 
 Officials of the town and country planning (TCP) department, sarpanch of Merces panchayat Sunita Palyekar, secretary Bipin Korgaonkar, president of MMWA Sudesh Kalangutkar and other villagers were present during the inspection.
 
 At the Mestabhat project site officials found that the road was less than 3.5m wide. “The project has been passed without proper inspection,” a local activist Paul D’Souza alleged.
 
 Officials also found that the buffer zone between the cemetery and the project boundary was 13.5m instead of the mandatory 15m. Another violation related to stilt parking was also noticed.
 
 At Molocca, the road to the site was less than four metres wide. 
 
 An access through the project site to some houses behind was also found to be inadequate. Another violation related to excess height of buildings was also seen.
 
 Kalangutkar said that roads in Merces are narrow and approving projects is in violation of High court of Bombay at Goa order.
 
 The panchayat issued approvals despite gram sabha highlighting issues of inadequate power and water infrastructure. “We will be compelled to initiate contempt proceedings if the TCP doesn’t act,” Kalangutkar said.
