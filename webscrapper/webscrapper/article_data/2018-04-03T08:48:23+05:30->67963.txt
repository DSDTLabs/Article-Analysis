 An adult tiger has been killed in a fight with a wild boar in Balaghat district, taking the toll of big cat deaths to nine in four months. The sixyear-old tiger’s carcass was spotted in Balaghat’s Logur range — on the   corridor — late Saturday night and it was recovered on Sunday. Initially, forest officials suspected the tiger was electrocuted or poisoned, but no such evidence was found during autopsy. “Fight with wild boars seems to be only reason as we have found boar hair and faecal samples on the spot,” said an officer. DFO Deva Prasad told TOI that the matter is still under investigation. “Wild boars could be the reason,” said the officer.
