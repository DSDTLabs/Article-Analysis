New Delhi: “My brother-in-law is no more n this stupid man is speaking all written script without any mind,” tweeted CM Arvind Kejriwal’s wife Sunita   in response to allegations by Karawal Nagar MLA  . The former water minister who was suspended from AAP’s membership on Monday night had alleged that minister   had helped Kejriwal’s brother-in-law S K Bansal in clearing a land deal. 

 As allegations mounted and AAP’s political affairs committee (PAC) went into a huddle, deputy CM   rushed out mid-way to respond to Mishra’s attack. He hit out at Mishra, saying, “Very sad to see how humanity has died. Kapil Mishra has been making baseless allegations. You (Mishra) are saying just anything about a person who died this morning. Within two hours of the man being cremated, Mishra has come out and started attacking him...Even god does not forgive such a person.” 
 
 AAP’s leader of opposition in Punjab, H S Phoolka, too tweeted in response to Sunita Kejriwal’s tweet. “While Kejriwal’s brother-in-law was cremated, baseless allegations levelled against dead man. Shameful. No proof, no details, bald allegations,” he said.
