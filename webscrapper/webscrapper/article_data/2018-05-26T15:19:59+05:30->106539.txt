SURAT: The city unit of   advocates acquisition of land of those residents who are not ready to accept a compromise formula suggested by   with regard to   bridge issue. The work of the bridge is 90 per cent complete except for the portion towards Umra. At least 16 of the total 23 residents do not accept the formula suggested by the civic body. 

 
 City unit BJP president   told TOI, “We would be forced to compulsorily acquire the land of people not ready to accept the compromise formula. A decision would be taken at the meeting of the standing committee within a week’s time. Justice has to be done to the people like the seven among the recalcitrant residents.” 
 
 SMC had suggested a compromise formula under which a 1,200 sq metre plot each was to be given to the affected residents to build their houses. Those residents who have houses on bigger than 50 metres of plot would be allotted remaining chunk of land at other place or compensation. However, the residents want their houses to be built by SMC and more money be given to them. 
 
 “We will follow the compromise formula with those who have agreed and will compulsorily acquire the land of others,” said a member of the standing committee. 
 
 The decision to build the Pal-Umra bridge at a cost of Rs89.99 crore was taken in 2012 and since then it has been mired in one or the other controversies.
