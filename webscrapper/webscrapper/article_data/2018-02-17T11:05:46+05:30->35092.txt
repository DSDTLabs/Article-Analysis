CHENNAI: The number of   consumers in the city booking cylinders for refills has almost doubled as the strike by bulk LPG tankers entered day four on Friday, triggering panic. 

 The strike, with 4,000 tankers participating, is against the Centre's revised tendering policy restricting vehicles carrying LPG cylinders registered in one state from operating in other states.
 
 The backlog in delivering LPG cylinders to customers increased from 1,000 to nearly 4,000 this week, according to LPG cylinders distribution association.
 
 In Tamil Nadu, where there are about 1,000 registered distributors with Indane, Bharat Petroleum and  , 10,000 cylinders, on an average, are sold to customers a month based on demand. 
 
 "As soon as the strike was announced, the number of bookings from customers rose from 400-450 to nearly 700 a day in Chennai," said   executive vice-president Captain Jagadeesan, . 
 
 Even supply from LPG bulk tankers who did not participate in the strike has almost halved in the last four days, he added. 
 
 "In Chennai, hotels and commercial establishments received most cylinders and domestic users are likely to face a supply crunch if strike continues for two more days," said a booking agent in Kilpauk.
 
 Chennai, unlike tier-II cities like Madurai or  , has limited storing capacity in its warehouses as supply is based mostly on the day's demand.
 
 Oil marketing companies have appealed to the protestors to withdraw the strike saying the revised policy will encourage more entrepreneurs and bring healthy competition.
