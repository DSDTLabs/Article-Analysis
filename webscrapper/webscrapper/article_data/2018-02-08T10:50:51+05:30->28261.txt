 The court’s directives came while hearing a PIL (No 71/2015) on civic body splurging crores on beautification and maintenance of the historic lake, despite it being a private property. The petitioners objected to NMC’s move to provide compensation to the owners — Dr Rekharani Bhiwapurkar (late Dr   was other owner) — based on TDR.
