AIADMK legislators have chosen V K Sasi kala as chief minister against the wishes of the people of Tamil Nadu, said DMK working president M K Stalin. “DMK will react to the issue democratically.DMK lost the assembly election only by 1.1% vote share,“ said Stalin.

 A few hours after   was elected as the AIADMK legislature leader, Stalin said people voted in 2016 assembly election for AIADMK hoping   will be the chief minister.
 
 “Even when Jayalalithaa was alive, she did not give any party job to Sasikala. When Jayalalithaa was in prison under the wealth case, O Panneerselvam was sworn in as chief minister and again when she was admitted to the hospital, Panneerselvam was asked to take care of the departments of Jayalalithaa,“ Stalin told re por ters in Tiruvarur.
 
 AIADMK got votes only due to Jayalalithaa and now a person who is in no way connected with people has been chosen as chief minister. This is nothing but deceiving voters who voted for AIADMK, said PMK founder S Ramadoss in a statement. Though the AIADMK contested in all 234 seats in Tamil Nadu, not even one seat was given to Sasikala, he said.
 
 “Though Jayalalithaa gave seats even to poor people, she did not give a seat to Sasikala.Thus only a person who has been elected under the AIADMK party must have been chosen as chief minister and that is democracy,“ said Ramadoss.
 
 The election of Sasikala shows that party MLAs are going against Jayalalithaa as well as people, he said.
 
 CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan, meanwhile, wished Sasikala after she was elected as legislature party leader and asked her to fulfil the people's wishes.
