As a conscientious citizen Babuji ( ) decides to cast his vote along with other members of the   household. But Ghotak ( ) chooses to treat the election day as a mid-week holiday as he considers the voting process a waste of time. Babuji tries his level best to get Ghotak to change his opinion on voting, but Ghotak is no mood to listen as he believes that the country is beyond redemption given the rampant corruption and crime.
Meanwhile, Babuji is in for a rude shock to find that someone has already voted in his name; other Chidiyaghar members also find themselves in a similar situation. Annoyed with the voting system, he decides to take action against it. Ghotak, in the meantime, goes to collect the good-quality wheat and rice that his assistant has brought from his village. 
 Says Paresh, “Ghotak is really fed up with the voting system, but Babuji does his best to reason with him that it requires people like Ghotak to vote for the right candidate to come to power. By selecting the right candidate, they contribute towards building an ideal society.”
 'Chidiyaghar' airs from Monday to Friday 9 pm on Sony SAB.
