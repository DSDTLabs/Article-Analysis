Rajkummar Rao-Shruti Haasan-starrer ' ' is a rom-com and the album reflects the film’s essence, as five out of seven songs are romantic at their core. The album opens with the parody of sorts, 'Jai Maa' - 'Kala Chashma' with a devotional twist. Jaidev Kumar retains the tune of the original — it was, in turn, a remixed version of Amar Arshi’s track. With Sonu Saggu replacing the lines with lyrics in praise of Maa Sherawali, we have in hand a number that reminds us of the 80s and 90s when devotional songs were set to the tunes of popular filmi numbers. Sahil Solanki and Jyotica Tangri do a commendable job of retaining the peppiness of the song and Parry G’s rap version is interesting. 

  is in his element in ' ', the pick of the album. A slow romantic number, its highlight is the soft flute in the interlude and the acoustic guitar that sets the tone of the background. Composed by Kaushik, Akash and Guddu, the lyrics have been penned by Bipin Das. Yet another song that joins the long list of remixes that Bollywood has churned out in the past two years is 'Jaanu'. A retake on RD Burman’s classic hit 'Jaanu Meri Jaan' from 'Shaan', this one has been recreated by Rishi Rich and sung by Juggy D, Shivi and Raftaar. This EDM version has retained the flavour of the original and is dance-able. 
 
 Next in line is 'Teri Yaadon Mein', sung by Yasser Desai, Pawni Pandey and Yash Narvekar. A romantic track, it starts on a promising note, but fails to maintain pace. However, its reprise version, sung by Yash (he has composed both the versions) and Sukriti Kakaar, more than makes up for it. 'Tenu Na Bol Pawaan', composed by Amjad Nadeem, is yet another slow melody and Yasser and Jyotica do a good job of keeping you hooked to it. But again, its reprise version by Asees Kaur makes for a better listen.
