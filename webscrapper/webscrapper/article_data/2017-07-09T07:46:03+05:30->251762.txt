VADODARA: Off-road driving may have taken off internationally but here in Gujarat, it is somewhat a closed-circuit comprising off-road driving aficionados. Sunil Nigam, a pioneer in off-road racing in   organised a one-day event full to the brim of adrenalin-rushing, heart-in-your-mouth event themed ‘XS Overland Off-road adventure’.

 The event on Saturday near   was divided into 10 different stages depending on the ability of the drivers. A natural track that was previously a plot of unused land was marked for the event. The land was carved into a contour land (a hilly track with a height of 6-7 metres). The stages were ‘uphill-downhill’ in which the degree of turn was 90 and 120 degrees simultaneously, ruts, ditch, pond and slush, to name a few. This event was held for the first time panning across the state and 42 people participated in the event, including two women. The event was affiliated with   of India (FMSCI) and is also known for dirt bike racing. At the end of the competition   from Ahmedabad bagged the first prize. Interestingly, Esha Munshi also from Ahmedabad bagged the award for the Best Navigation Of The Day.
