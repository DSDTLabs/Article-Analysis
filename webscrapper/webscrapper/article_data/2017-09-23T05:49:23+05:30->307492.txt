AHMEDABAD: It was a sense of deja vu for a number of   at   on Friday night when they were   as part of ‘cleansing’ at the entrance by members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The ‘shuddhi’ was preceded by applying a vermilion tilak on forehead of the revellers. 

 As on Friday night, Gandhinagar police did not receive any complaint about the incident. The same venue had seen the same practice during Navratri festival last year which was heavily criticized as it was seen as a screening device to ensure that no person from other faiths participate in the garba festivities. On Friday night, the VHP members were stationed outside the venue for nearly 25 minutes, said participants.
 
 Surya Prakash Vaishnav, an activist with Bajrang Dal said, “We are going to individual garba venues in Gandhinagar and neighbouring villages to warn young Hindu women against Love Jihad. We also want to spread awareness and encourage families to use cow urine for tilak on special occasions to welcome guests.” 
 
 Thanghanat garba organiser Sandeep Joshi told TOI that Bajrang Dal had informed them well in advance about the proposed ‘drive.’ “There was no untoward incident,” he said.
 
 The participants apparently had no issue with the ‘shuddhikaran’. “Use of gau mutra is an ancient practice and part of our culture. I had no problem with it,” said Sakshi Parmar, a garba reveller.
