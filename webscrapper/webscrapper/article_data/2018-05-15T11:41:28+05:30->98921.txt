Recently the actor met popular actress   on   and Subhashree’s wedding reception. The actors, who are good friends off-screen, caught up after a long time. 

 Later Gourab shared a photo with the actress on his social media account.
 
 Here's the post:
 
  
 
 Almost 10 years ago Gourab and Sandipta made their debut on small screen with a very popular daily soap ‘Durga’. In the serial Gourab essayed the character of an innocent boy Rupam.
 
 In the show, Rupam didn’t have a normal life as he was kept captive by his greedy relatives, who were after his property. Sandipta, on the other hand played the role of ‘Durga’, a village belle. The story of the serial featured the journey of Durga, who gets married to Rupam and how she helps him lead a normal life by defeating the foul plans of his relatives. The chemistry between this on-screen couple was loved by the audience.
 
 After the success of the serial, both the actors have done a number of serials. Presently Gourab is seen in the daily soap ‘Adorini’, where he is essaying the character   and Sandipta is seen in the serial ‘Pratidaan.’ But the viewers still recall them as Rupam and Durga. No wonder that the actors became happy after meeting each other.
