CALANGUTE: Tourism stakeholders and residents of Gauravaddo,  , have expressed concern over dug-up roads in the area, especially with the monsoon around the corner.

 The roads have been dug up for the sewerage pipeline network and connecting chambers right from the main   road and at other places leading to the beach, making them unmotorable and causing frequent traffic jams.
 
 When contacted, Calangute panchayat member   said the sewerage pipeline contractor has to restore the dug-up roads, and that they’re expecting the work to be completed before the monsoon arrival in the first week of June.
 
 “Work of levelling and stabilising is going on. If the roads are tarred in the present condition, they will simply sink again,”   said.
