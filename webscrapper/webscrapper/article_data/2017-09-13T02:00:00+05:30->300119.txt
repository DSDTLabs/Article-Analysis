PATNA: Madhepura,   and   districts have reported an outbreak of diarrhoea after the receding of floodwaters. Rapid response teams have been formed by the respective civil surgeons in the three districts for epidemic response action and to monitor and control the situation. 

 State epidemiologist Dr Ragini Mishra on Tuesday said one death due to acute diarrhoea was reported in Madhepura. In the 17 flood-affected districts. A total of 8,475 cases of acute diarrhoea and gastroenteritis have been reported since the floods in these districts in mid August. The cases included 3,283 from Araria, 145 from Darbhanga, 119 from Gopalganj, 31 from Khagaria, 24 from Kishanganj, 1657 from  , 130 from Madhepura, 420 from Muzaffarpur, 111 from West Champaran, 734 from Purnia, 230 from  , 230 from Sheohar, 750 from Sitamarhi, 505 from Samastipur, 11 from   and 73 from Supaul.
 
 “The numbers show the enormity of the problem as more and more people suffer from acute diarrhoea and gastroenteritis post-floods. Some districts have reported more cases than the three districts, but the patients there managed with local level treatment. In these three districts, the management at local level is not possible and patients are in very serious condition,” Dr Mishra said.
 
 She said a rapid response team has been formed in all the block levels of the three districts. They would investigate the cases and provide active surveillance. They would either treat the patients there or send them to the sadar or district hospital if their condition worsened. The response teams have already started working in the three districts, she added.
 
 The health department has distributed ORS solutions along with food packets during flood relief operations. Bleaching powder and halogen tablets have also been made available to the flood victims. Each district has been asked to keep 500 bags of bleaching powder in stock. Two doctors have been monitoring the ‘104’ toll-free number, which is functional 24X7.
