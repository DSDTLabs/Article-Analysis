Panaji: Still smarting after the exit of former Cumbharjua MLA Pandurang Madkaikar, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) on Monday attempted a show of strength. The grand old party flaunted panchayat representatives of five villages which come under the Cumbharjua constituency.

 Speaking on the occasion, GPCC president Luizinho Faleiro promised to regularize all contractual employees who completed five years of service and to come up with a fresh law to address mundkar and tenancy cases.
 
 Accepting the membership forms of two sarpanchas and several panch members from the villages of Corlim and Carambolim, Faleiro said that several more panch members from Old Goa, Carambolim, Divar and Mollar were expected to join in the coming days.
 
 The members, who joined on Monday, included a former   taluka pramukh and a   mandal member.
 
 Former BJP member German D’Mello returned to the fold and vouched that the Congress would retain Cumbharjua despite Madkaikar’s exit.
 
 The Congress, in a press note, said, “The ensuing state assembly elections will certainly mark the beginning of the electoral downfall of the BJP and mark the resurgence of a strong Congress.”
 
 Faleiro tried to woo contract workers and tenants. “All employees working for the government on contract, who complete five years of service, will automatically be regularized. We will reverse the mundkar and tenancy amendments. We will ensure that their rights are protected by a legislation,” he said.
 
 Citing the BJP manifesto in 2012, which promised to move casinos out of Goa, Faleiro questioned the need for chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar to consult with the advocate general (AG) of Goa Saresh Lotlikar.
