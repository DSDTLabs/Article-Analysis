PANCHKULA: High-velocity wind that swept through   snapped power supply and uprooted trees, unipoles and transformers mounted on poles.

 
 A mobile tower mounted on the rooftop of a house in Phase 11 came crashing down but fortunately, there were no casualties. The mobile tower could be seen hanging in mid-air, supported by overhead electricity cables. This precarious position prevented it from falling on vehicles parked on the road.
 
 Sushma Rani, a resident of the house on which the mobile tower collapsed, said, “The tower was erected 10 years ago. It has damaged the overhead water tank and the ceiling of our house.” Fire fighters extricated the mobile tower entangled in electricity wires, using a hydraulic ladder to do so.
 
 The unipole erected to support the metallic structure for display of advertisement hoardings fell on the dividing road of sectors 10 and 11. The base of the metallic unipoles was rusted, because of which they could not withstand the wind. A   was pressed into service to remove the debris from the main road. In Industrial Area, Phase 1, a transformer came crashing down.
