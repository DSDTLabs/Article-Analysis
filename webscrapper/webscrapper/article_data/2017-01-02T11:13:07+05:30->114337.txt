SURAT: Many people chose to   to   on Saturday, but unwittingly became the reason behind injuries caused to a few birds in the city. The noise of the firecrackers made the birds that were sleeping to lose balance and  , which added to the number of the birds injured by manja ahead of Uttarayan festival. 

 Prayas, a non-government organization, received 14 calls on Saturday about birds injured from falling off their perches and found entangled in manja. 
 
 "Last year during Uttarayan, we had received 700 calls of injuries to birds. The state government has banned Chinese manja and also glass manja, but still we are getting calls of birds getting injured by them," Prayas volunteer Darshan Desai said. "Many people get injured by manja a few days before Uttarayan because they are not aware about kite flying in the area. People become cautious about manja only a day or two before Uttarayan," Desai said, adding that three persons had died from injuries caused by manja in the city in 2015. 
 
 He asked people not to fly kites when it is time for the birds to fly. Birds mostly fly before 9 am and in the evening hours when it is time for them to return to their nests. The major species of birds that were injured this season so far from manja were pigeons, crows and egrets, Desai said.
