 Celine Dion says it is a matter of pride and honour for her to have sung hit love ballad ' ' for the film ' '. 

 The 49-year-old songstress recently sang the number from the 1997 blockbuster at the Awards to celebrate the 20th anniversary of film.
 
  
  
 
 
 "Being a part of a classic is a very big, big honour. I think it's because it (song) was not supposed to be a part of the movie, period," said Dion. 
 
 She recalls the experience as 'emotional' and adds she had to 'hold (her) tears' during the performance. 
 
 "My Heart Will Go On" went on to win the Award for Best Original Song.
