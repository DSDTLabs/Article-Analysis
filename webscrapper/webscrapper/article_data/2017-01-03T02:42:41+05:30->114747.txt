NEW DELHI: A day after lieutenant governor   joined Twitter, his office on Monday asked the police to act against fake handles posting misleading posts in his name. 

 These posts are critical of chief minister   and the elected   government. The LG’s office is planing to take up the matter with Twitter and get the account verified. 
 
 Going by fake posts, including those on the Shunglu committee that looked into the decisions of the AAP government, the virtual impostors seem to be well aware of the tussle between the AAP government and Baijal’s predecessor, Najeeb Jung.
 
 Two such accounts—@AnilBaijal_LG and @AnilBaijal_—have garnered a substantial following since December 28, the day Baijal was appointed to the post. “Jung has left behind 400 files of the Delhi government. Now I am in a dilemma as to whether to approve or return them,” tweeted @AnilBaijal_. 
 
 Referring to CM Arvind Kejriwal’s criticism of PM  , the other fake handle says, “Sir, using such language does not behove you irrespective of differences of opinion.”
 
 In his first tweet on @LtGovDelhi, the   wished Delhiites on New Year. His office announced that it would be a medium for “more productive engagement” with media and public. Over 2,000 people are already following the LG. The handle has received grievances that the LG’s office plans to take up off social media by contacting these people.
