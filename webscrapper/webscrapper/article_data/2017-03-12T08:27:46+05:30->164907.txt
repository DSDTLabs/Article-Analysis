CHENNAI:   made it clear right at the outset that he didn't want to talk about 'Cheatgate'. “So much has been spoken about it. I just want a peaceful resolution to the issue. Let cricket be the winner,” was the former Aussie great's response to the query. But the burly opener, who made life difficult for the Indian bowlers right through the first decade of the 2000s, spoke at length to TOI on the ongoing series. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 The series has been excellent in spite of once again being played on substandard pitches. These teams have fought extremely hard, particularly in the second Test match. For Australia, Matt Renshaw has made the difference in this series. He has absorbed enormous pressure on difficult batting conditions and for a man of just 20 years, he has shown class and maturity.
 
 
 
 
 I have already said that the Test matches were on substandard pitches. It's strange because India are good enough to play on good surfaces which naturally break up and start to turn. The fact that [Nathan] Lyon took eight in the first innings of a Test match says it all.
 
 
 
 
 Yes, the batting style and posture are identical. But I believe Matt will do it his way and will improve in all conditions around the world with time and experience.
 
 
 
 
 The sweep shot is vital to have on Indian conditions, but having said that, I conditioned myself to play the shot through 10 years of first-class cricket. So it does take time and if you are not comfortable then it is a shot which should not be forced.
 
 
 
 
 If conditions prove to be dry in Ranchi, the Australian selectors must consider playing allrounder Ashton Agar. They didn't get much out of   either with the bat or the ball and that could be a factor which led to Starc's injury.
 
 
 
 
 Lyon is a natural leader of the Australian spin bowling outfit, something that he has done for a while now. In tandem with O'Keefe, I believe they will continue to keep India's batsmen on their toes.
