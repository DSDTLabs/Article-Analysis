CHENNAI: Coming down heavily on the   for being ‘outdated’, two students from Chennai now studying in   have called for an urgent revision of the curriculum. Addressing the media on Monday, Honeyshya and   said that despite scoring high marks in Class XII exams, TN students who move to reputed institutions like   are unable to cope with the standard of education there.

 Honeyshya, who finished her schooling in Chennai and is currently studying political science, points out that even students who had scored as high as 95% in their TN state board exams are unable to compete with their classmates, given the broad curriculum and application-centric learning at DU, which is completely lacking in the rote-learning driven state board syllabus. “Students from Tamil Nadu state board only secure 5 pointer CGPAs here,” she said. The state board syllabus was last updated in 2004, with several components of the syllabus having become redundant. 
 
 “A simple question on how many shareholders a private company can have would be answered incorrectly if we go by TN textbooks. In this case, the Companies Act was amended to increase the number from 50 to 200 members in 2007 itself, but our textbooks continue to teach the outdated and wrong information to students which is hampering their higher education,” says Devadarshini, who is pursuing her BCom at SRCC.
 
 While an update in the syllabus was at the forefront of their demands, they also called for a change in the pedagogy and evaluation system, suggesting a more application-based approach to subjects. “This will also help state board students do better in competitive exams like NEET and JEE,” added Honeyshya.
 
 A draft citing these shortcomings was compiled by the students and submitted to Udhayachandran, principal secretary in the school education department, on Monday.
