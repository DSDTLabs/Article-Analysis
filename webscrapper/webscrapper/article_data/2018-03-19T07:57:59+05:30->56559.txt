GUWAHATI: Three days after a 35-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped in front of her husband in  's Nagaon district, police have been granted four days' remand of the eight accused who were arrested on Saturday. 

 "If required, we may seek more time for questioning," Nagaon SP Shankar Barata Raimedhi said, adding that the survivor's condition is now stable.
 
 On Thursday, the couple was travelling from Kampur to Hojai. Upon reaching Chaparmukh, they couldn't find any means of transport to reach Hojai, said police. "The prime accused, Marjot Ali, took them to Kakotigaon on the pretext of providing them shelter for the night. At an isolated place near Kopili river, seven others... were already waiting," said a cop.
 
 "The group thrashed her husband and gang-raped the woman in front of him before robbing the couple and fleeing the spot," he added.
