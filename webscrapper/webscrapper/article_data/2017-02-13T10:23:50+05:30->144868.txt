SURAT:   (SMC) plans to construct an   at approximately Rs 300 crore cost. A   is conducting a technical and financial feasibility study on the project in which a Singapore-based ONG firm and another company have shown interest. 

  Infra Private Limited, which has been appointed consultant, is expected to submit its first report to the SMC within 15 days on the stadium that would come up on 1.25 lakh square meter of land in Town Planning Schemes no 8 and 9.
 
 The report would suggest 30,000 capacity seating for the stadium and commercial activities that could be promoted at the complex to house a sports academy, a tennis court, a badminton court and have facilities for archery, squash, table tennis, shooting, volleyball and basketball. 
 
 The SMC would soon be setting up a 11-member committee comprising experts to study the report. The SMC will not be investing a single rupee on the project. The money will be invested in the project by its private partner on construct, operate and maintain terms.
 
 “We hope to complete the project in three years time. We are hopeful of getting a private partner for the project soon,” a SMC officer said.
