TRICHY:  , of the CPI, has demanded that the state should provide Rs 10,000 as input subsidy in advance for   in the state in every season. 

 As per the   government's new scheme, the farmers will be given Rs 4,000 per acre twice a year to cover the costs of major inputs such as fertilisers and seeds, said PS  , state secretary of   Vivasayigal Sangam. 
 
 “This will be helpful for the farmers who are already in distress,” he said. “The Telangana government has launched the scheme during the current crop season. Under this, the state had disbursed the money to buy those inputs in advance for each season.”
 
 The state only announced package when there is a loss of crop due to various reasons including lack of water. But that too has not been disbursed to all farmers, he said. “However, as per the new scheme in Telangana, it has been announced that the input subsidy would be given to all farmers, irrespective of the land holdings,” Masilamani said.
 
 "The government need not extend the scheme to the farmers who kept their lands idle. However, it should provide to those who dare to take the risk as an encouragement," he added.
 
 The government should announce Rs 10,000 as input subsidy in advance to all farmers, no matter whether they cultivate own land or leased one. He alleged that no scheme, including crop insurance, agriculture assistance and package, have not been properly disbursed to the affected farmers.
