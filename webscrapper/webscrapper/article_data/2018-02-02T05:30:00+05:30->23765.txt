Mysuru: India’s first Intelligent Transport System ( ), aimed at cutting down passenger waiting time at   stops in Mysuru, seems to be in trouble as electronic display boards that provide information about arrival of buses are either missing or not working at some stops.

 At a few places, the   are not switched on due to lack of power supply. A screen at Agrahara bus stop on VaniVilas Road abutting the market building has been missing for a few weeks. It’s one of the busiest stops in the city as it connects to different parts of south and west Mysuru from the city bus stand.
 
 The screen at another stop on JLB Road opposite the petrol station near RTO (West) office has been defunct for almost a year. 
 
 The LCD screens were designed to provide accurate information to passengers to reduce waiting time or to help them plan their journey. 
 
 Vijaya, a private firm employee, said, “It looks we’re back to square one — watching for buses to arrive at the stop. If we had information about arrival of buses, it makes it much easier for us.”
 
 “Commuters will prefer taking the bus if they have access to arrival time. Giving information on a display screen is good but it has to be maintained,” said Mallikarjun, another private firm employee. 
 
 KH Srinivas, divisional controller, said except for one or two screens, all 167 LCD screens fitted at bus stops are working. He said, “Some screens at the bus stand have problems and we’re fixing them.”
