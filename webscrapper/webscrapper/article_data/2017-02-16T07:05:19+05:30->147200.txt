MEERUT: Democracy, they say, is the art of running a circus from the monkey cage. But what happens when simians decide to play, quite literally, with EVMs that help exercise our democratic rights. Faced with threat to EVMs kept at a dilapidated building on the outskirts of the city, the   administration has deployed langurs to protect the portable machines. Langurs are believed to discourage monkeys from raiding places where they are kept.“We tried to put up a tent to protect the machines from rain, but monkeys attacked even that. With langurs on duty now, there should be some relief,” DM B   said, adding, langurs will be at the spot till the day of counting on March 12. The district will see nearly 24,43,737 voters decide fate of 72 candidates from 7 constituencies.
