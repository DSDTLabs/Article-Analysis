AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday ordered Gandhinagar police to conduct an inquiry immediately into a complaint filed against   MLA from   constituency,  , accusing him of threatening a woman to grab land belonging to an NRI.

 The high court has asked the police inspector of Sector 7 police station at Gandhinagar to probe the complaint at the earliest to check whether it shows a cognizable offence by the legislator. Since the allegations have been levelled against a sitting MLA, the SP has been asked to monitor the case. 
 
 “I expect a very fair, transparent and impartial inquiry in this matter,” Justice J B Pardiwala said while issuing notice to Gandhinagar police and seeking their reply by June 15.
 
 The HC ordered the inquiry after Gandhinagar resident Pushpa Sargara filed a petition through advocate J T Trivedi complaining that she filed a complaint with Gandhinagar police a month ago against Bharwad and his men for criminal intimidation with intention to grab properties belonging to a jeweller, who lives in South Africa. Being a power-of-attorney holder, her husband was looking after the properties and collected rent. But, Bharwad’s men threatened her to give up the rent amount.
 
 The petition contended that the complaint had been sent not only to Gandhinagar police, but to all concerned authorities including the state home minister. But since the accused in the case is a sitting MLA, police was not taking action on the complaint.
