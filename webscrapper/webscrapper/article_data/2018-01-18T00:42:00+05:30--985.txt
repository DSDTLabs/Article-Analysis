There was heated exchange of words and mild push and pull between supporters of the ruling AIADMK faction and TTV Dinakaran supporters.  At one point TTV Dinakaran supporters tore banners with pictures of chief minister Edappadi K Palanisami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, which was tied close to the statue. Police said that TTV Dinakaran supporters were supposed to be at the venue to garland the statue at 10 am, while the other faction was to be there at 10.30 am. But both the factions reached the place at 10.30 am. There was an argument between the two factions on who would garland the statue first. Dinakaran supporters argued that they had got police permission for garlanding first, the other faction argued that the former were late and that it was time for them to garland the statue. Supporters of Dinakaran then garlanded the statue after tearing the banner of the chief minister and deputy chief minister. The other faction then tied the banner once again after the Dinakaran faction left and then garlanded the statue. The incident affected traffic at the busy junction for some time, before the issue was settled amicably.
