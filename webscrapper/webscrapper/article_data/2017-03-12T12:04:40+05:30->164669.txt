Within the short span of time that was available to us, we couldn’t do as much as we would have liked. 
 
 
 
 
 At our last meeting, we discussed all these possibilities and notwithstanding the result, AAP will be here in Goa. We will continue to work and enlighten people. That enlightenment has to come in.
 
 
 
 
 While selecting candidates, there is a criteria that needs to be followed. Yes, there were murmurs about the selection of candidates. But it all comes down to lack of time. What more could we do? How much could you listen to people and change candidates? It wasn’t easy.
 
 
 
 
 I am not disappointed. The money factor played a big role. In the last four-five days, a lot of money flowed in Cuncolim and the election machinery was found wanting. We expected better (from the election machinery) but that didn’t happen.
