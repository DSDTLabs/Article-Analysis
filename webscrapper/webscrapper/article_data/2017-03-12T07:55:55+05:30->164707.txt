NAGPUR:  , aged 13 years, only son of his parents, ended life by hanging himself from the ceiling fan at his   residence on Saturday. The deceased,  , was likely to be studying before he committed suicide as there were books strewn on the bed when cops reached the place. The reason behind his taking the   is still not clear as cops are trying to figure out the cause which triggered the drastic decision. 

 It’s learnt that Harshavardhan’s mother Archana had gone to bank and his father Manoj, a driver, to his work. A stunned Archana alerted her neighbours after returning home seeing her son hanging from the fan. She, along with the neighbour, rushed Harshavardhan to a private hospital before taking him to Government medical college and hospital where he was pronounced dead before admission. Police have claimed that there was no suicide note found. 
 
 Family members, left shattered by the incident, have expressed shock by the manner Harshavardhan committed suicide. A section of the cops and family members are now presuming that Harshavardhan may have taken to heart a common chiding from parents after he scored unsatisfactorily in the last unit test at school. Known to a cordial and friendly, kin said Harshavardhan was neither aggressive nor adamant. “He (Harshavardhan) would help his cousins in studies and also try to intervene into fights when his friends would squabble,” said a relative. 
 
 Ajni police have registered the case as accidental death. His post-mortem was conducted at GMCH.
