MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday reserved its order on a plea filed by self-styled godman and founder of Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam, Nithyananda seeking a direction to the commissioner of police of Madurai to provide protection to perform rituals at the Madurai Aadheenam.

 During arguments, the government advocate K   told justice M V  , who heard the plea that Nithyananda lied before the court. He did not submit any representation to the police seeking protection, the prosecution said.
 
 Disputing it, Nithyanandaâ€™s side said the petitioner sent a representation on September 21 and also said he was ready to give a fresh representation in that regard. All kind of activities are allowed in the Aadheenam. The petitioner was appointed as a 293rd pontiff, who wanted to give free food and to perform religious duties at the Aadheenam. Hence, he should be permitted to do his duties, his side said.
 
 The counsel who represented Madurai Aadheenam opposed the plea by saying that a suit with regard to a similar issue is pending before the Madurai sub-court since 2013. The court has not passed any order so far. Nithyananda has filed the present case before the high court bench with malafide intention.
 
 At one point of time, the judge observed that Nithyananda may give a fresh representation to the police, who may consider it and pass order on merits. But, heavy opposition from the government and Aadheenam sides led the court to reserve its order.
