RAMPUR: Uttar Pradesh minorities affairs minister Baldev Singh   has sought a detailed report from the Sambhal district administration about the exodus of Muslim families from   village after they were attacked and their houses burnt down. 

  Aulakh said that CM   has told authorities that the exodus of any community should not take place in any part of the state. "The culprits should be punished, because the exodus of the minority community from the village is a shameful act. The government will take all necessary action after it gets the report," he added. 
 
  "Police have been asked to deal with the issue in a firm manner and provide round-the-clock protection to minority residents of the village. We are in touch with our party members in the area to talk to those who have left so far and bring them back to their homes," Aulakh said. "PM   and CM   believe in 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'. Nobody is above the law," the minister added.
