Surat: Tapi irrigation canal, through which water is supplied to five districts of south Gujarat covering 3.31 lakh hectare of land, will remain closed till February 15 for repairs.  Crops like sugarcane, banana, paddy, chickoo and also vegetables in the region are dependent on water from Ukai dam. However, this year 50 per cent of it has already been expended. The water level in the dam at the end of monsoon season was just 325 feet. The irrigation department stopped releasing water into the canal from December 18, 2017 and officials said this won’t affect the crops.  Superintending engineer, Surat irrigation circle, S P Mahakal said, “The water supply to canal is stopped every year for a month. However, this time it will be for a longer duration due to canal lining work and some repairs.” The irrigation department normally supplies 4,000 million cubic metres (MCM) of water to the fields through the 4,537 km long canal network. This time it has been decided to supply 2315 MCM of water for irrigation.  Out of the total quota allotted for the year, 868 MCM of water has already been supplied. The remaining 1450 MCM of water would be supplied in three rotations between February and May. At present, the water level in Ukai dam is 316.16 feet. The decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of irrigation advisory committee held in September 2017.  Assistant director, horticulture, Dinesh Padaliya said, “Every crop that grows in the region needs regular water in a gap of 10 to 15 days. When irrigation water is not available, farmers use water from the borewell. Luckily, enough water is available to sustain their crops. However, problem is for sowing of new vegetable crop and hence farmers should not go for it. Tapi irrigation canal was closed for more than a month in the past, too, and the farmers were able to save their crops.”
