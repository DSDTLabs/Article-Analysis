KOCHI:   (which means ‘the one who has to redo’ in Flemish) is an exemplar of the millennial dream – a combination of wanderlust, art and all things abstract. 

 The 26-year-old   who roams around the world with a drawstring bag full of art supplies and spray paints and leaves a piece of his work in the cities on the course of his globetrotting, has now left one in the streets of Kochi as well.
 
 Painting a sleeping potato-like animated human figure on a wall near   at Mattancherry, Bisser said: “Most of the time, I draw something particular for the street or the city I’m in. Here, I didn’t get to spend much time to get the vibe of the place. So I drew something abstract with the character. It doesn’t stand for anything particular here.”
 
 The artist mostly does wall art, and in winters, when working outside is tiring, he shifts from walls to canvases, and sells them to save up for the next season of globetrotting. In the 10 years of his street painting, the artist has painted on the walls of England, New York, Brazil, Cyprus, Portugal, India, Spain and various parts of Europe.
 
 “In Europe,   and street arts are more common, and people don’t react that much as it is a typical sight. But here, everybody’s happy and is very positive about it. Once we got a nice meal cooked by people in the neighbourhood for painting a wall near them at Puthussery. The work was for a surf club and they even taught us how to surf,” Bisser said.
 
 Graffiti is yet to be identified as an art form here, he noted. “When I was in Mumbai, a group of artists said that there are only around 20 graffiti artists across India, whereas in the city I stay in   itself has more than that,” the artist said.
