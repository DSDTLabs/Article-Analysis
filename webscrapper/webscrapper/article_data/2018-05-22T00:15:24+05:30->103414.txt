Coimbatore: Members of the Coimbatore District Pricol Workers Union under All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) on Monday staged a protest in front of the firm’s corporate office at Race Course condemning the move to allegedly withhold the amount for unused leaves and also for not giving them the amount under children’s education benefits. According to the protesters, about 800 workers of the firm are members of their union and only around 300 people are members of the trade union under the firm. As to undermine their strength, the firm has been withholding their benefits and has been giving the monetary benefits for unused leaves only to those who were not part of the workers union, they said. “Also, the firm had to sit for a discussion for the new labour agreement in the beginning of the year. But they have not yet called for an agreement. We also raised this issue with the firm’s authorities,” said P Natarajan, president of the union. The firm had also not been giving the union members uniform allowance, he said. Natarajan said about 50 workers and their children had gathered at the firm’s corporate office to protest. “The firm’s authorities called us for a discussion. When we raised our concerns, they said they would meet us again and address our issues,” said Natarajan. Meanwhile, R Malarvannan, chief people officer at Pricol, told TOI that the firm had been fulfilling all the terms of the two agreements signed in 2012 and 2014. “But the union people have not implemented six to seven terms of the agreements though the agreements have been signed by the management, the union and the labour department. We have been giving them the benefits for the past 72 months. We are ready to give them the benefits even now if they fulfil the terms of the agreement. This issue is also being heard by the labour department. They are resorting to protests to tarnish the firm’s image,” he said.
