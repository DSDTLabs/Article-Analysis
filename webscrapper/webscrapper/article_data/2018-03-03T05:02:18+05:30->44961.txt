KOLKATA: East-West Metro project’s tunnel boring machine (TBM) has crossed   and is steadily heading towards Esplanade. The authorities are relieved the TBM (nicknamed Prerna) has crossed the crucial Raj-era edifice without a glitch. The twin TBM — Rachana — has crossed Lalit Great Eastern Hotel.

 Rachna, the other TBM, has slowed down after crossing Lalit Great Eastern Hotel for technical reasons. The authorities have decided to increase the distance between the two TBMs as the stretch between Laldighi-BBD Bag and Esplanade has several crumbling heritage structures. The most challenging part of the tunnelling was under the five dilapidated buildings which Rachna had to negotiate with. Now, two more buildings, identified by implementing agency   (KMRC) as “critical” are to be crossed.
 
 “The slowdown of Rachna is deliberate as we want to keep a distance of about 200m between the two machines,” an official said. Both TBMs must be stationed at least 50m apart to prevent any kind of upheaval underground. Fortunately, Rachna will be at least 20m away from the two critical buildings on  .
 
 On Friday, Prerna reached the traffic rotary on the Red Road crossing, near Esplanade, where the 16.34km underwater Metro tunnel will merge with the existing North-South line. From Esplanade, two new TBMs will burrow to Sealdah.
