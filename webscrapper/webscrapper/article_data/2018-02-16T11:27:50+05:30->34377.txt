KOCHI: Private Bus Owners Coordination Committee went on an indefinite strike from Friday. According to bus owners, the hike in bus fare announced by the state government on Tuesday is not sufficient to meet their running cost. 

 Coordination committee members added that the minimum charge should have been hiked to Rs 10 and the concessional fare paid by students must be increased by 50%. They added that they would start a hunger strike in front of the Secretariat if the government failed to sort out the issue before Monday.
 
 Officer-bearers of the Private Bus Operators' Federation said that the constant increase in fuel price over the past few months led them to take this harsh decision. They felt that government should have increased the student concession component.
 
 The federation said that the government did not listen to their demands. The demands were brining both petrol and diesel under GST regime, withdrawal of increased road tax and constituting a regulatory committee.
 
 The minimum fare of ordinary and city service buses have gone up by a rupee to Rs 8. The minimum fare for fast passenger buses has been increased to Rs 11 from Rs 10. The minimum fare of superfast buses will be Rs 15, earlier it was Rs 13. AC buses and Volvo services hiked minimum fares by Rs 4 and Rs 5, respectively.
 
 Meanwhile, transport minister AK Saseendran said in   that private operators should end their strike. He said the announcement was made on the basis of the recommendations of Justice C Ramachandran panel. The government is ready to hold talks with bus operators, he said. tnn
