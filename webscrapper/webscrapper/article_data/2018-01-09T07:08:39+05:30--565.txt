KOLKATA: The case of an assistant professor being attacked by unidentified persons twice in three days — once close to his college and then outside the   station — has baffled cops. Victim Om  , 36, who is employed in the department of commerce at   at Rash Behari Avenue, lodged an FIR on Sunday, alleging that the attacks could possibly be a fallout of some student trouble at the college. However, cops said they were probing all possible angles, including enmity, as the cause behind the incidents.

 Deshbandhu College has been at the centre of controversy along with two other colleges after student unrest broke out on campus last Thursday after some students were barred from taking their semester exams due to low attendance. Chowdhury was first assaulted on January 4, allegedly by college students.
 
 
 
 On January 6, four unidentified men who had no direct link with the college attacked him near Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro station. They also reportedly threatened the complainant with dire consequence if he complained.
 
 The cops said they were looking at CCTV footages to ascertain the identity of the accused. “The college fracas has been kept in mind. If required, we might speak to his colleagues. The college is meant for girls and if four men have attacked him, then it must mean that outsiders were involved,” said an officer.
 
 When contacted, Chowdhury refused to speak to TOI in detail. “You know about the incidents that took place at my college. But this is something that I do not want to pursue any more. I request you not to push me for an answer,” he said. He, however, denied, that he was under any pressure.
