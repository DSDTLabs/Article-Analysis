VARANASI: A day after a woman was allegedly gang-raped by two men in front of her husband in   district on Sunday night, cops arrested one of the accused on Monday. 

 Sources said the Sultanpur-based couple had gone to Shahganj to consult a doctor. While returning home on their bike, they stopped at a culvert near   area to relieve themselves. Soon after, the accused arrived at the spot on a bike and severely thrashed the husband. They then took turns in raping the woman - who is in her early thirties - while another held the husband. The culprits also threatened them with dire consequences if they reported the crime.
 
 The couple lodged a police complaint on Monday morning, following which a case was registered for rape, defamation, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, statements conducing to public mischief, criminal intimidation and also the SC/ST Act, since the victim is a dalit. One of the accused was arrested thereafter.
 
 "Moje Yadav of   village was arrested and we have launched a manhunt for his accomplice in the crime," Khutahan SHO Ram Murti Yadav told TOI.
