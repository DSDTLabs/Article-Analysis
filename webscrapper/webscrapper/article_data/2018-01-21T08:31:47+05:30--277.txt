VADODARA: City-based   on Saturday witnessed ruckus when a group of parents had gone to the school to make a representation on circulars and reminders being issued demanding fees of third quarter. 

 The group of parents had reached the school to submit a memorandum stating that since the school had already issued a circular in the past in which it had stated that it will abide by the order of the   in connection to the   Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017, the school should keep its promise. 
 
 The parents were demanding that since the Gujarat High Court has already upheld the Act which has capped the annual fees at Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 for primary, middle and high school levels, the school should refund the excess fees. 
 
 But when the group reached the school premises, the premises was locked down and the parents were not allowed to enter or meet school representatives. 
 
 According to the parents, even as   police which had reached the spot, intervened and asked the school management to accept the memorandum from a couple of representatives, the school management did not relent.
 
 Agitated parents also shared school circulars that stated that lunch earlier provided to the students was stopped for those students whose parents had not paid the third quarter fees with effect from January 17. 
 
 A couple of parents alleged that their wards are being tortured by the school authorities who are not ready to listen to their representations.
