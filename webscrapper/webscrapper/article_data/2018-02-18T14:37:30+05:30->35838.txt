 Talking to TOI, Rawat said, "It is a cheating with students. Never heard of the company. Mobile set of poor make is worth Rs 1,200 and hardly functions for 2 or 3 months. Those who were given these phones last year will also return them to the collector on Monday. Many of them have not even opened the pack."
 
 Minister of state for women and child welfare Lalita Yadav, the chief guest, tried to save the situation. Yadav said, " I will convey feelings of students to the chief minister and the higher education minister. He can even distribute 5G phones to students."
