You hate me sometimes for my bohemian behaviours. You want to get back to me for my leftist statements. You get disheartened by my agnostic remarks. Well don't you? But that's how it is these days. A 20-something daughter and her mother don't always agree. But agreement is one thing; love is another. Just because I don't agree with your social anxieties or just because you don't agree with my not picking my vessels after meals, we don't love each other any lesser.

 Because the world is all objective and on-point these days, people understand listicles better than features. So today, I would list down how you spell in my world, how the arrangement of letters is beautiful but yet, sometimes I can't help but wish if an 'N' were a 'Y' and that the 'I' should come before the 'O'.
 
 
 
 
 
 - I love the way you have the most strength in the world. Dealing with three daughters and only a kid-like husband isn't a cakewalk. Thanks for bearing it all and yet never showing that you are 'bearing'.
 
 - I don't like how you don't always talk out your worries. You think and overthink and superthink. Stop doing that. It's not a very healthy thing to do.
 
 - I love the way you are patient much, unlike all four in your family. Amongst a rally of loudsters, it's always a calm to have someone who won't shout. Mostly.
 
 - I don't like the way you rethink about buying what you bought, not buying what you didn't buy. It's a small life to have second thoughts. Wish I could teach you this one thing (an overmature overreacher that I am). 
 
 - I love the paranthas that you make. They are the best in the world.
 
 - Make me some sambhar the next time I ask of you and not three days later, please. You don't take me seriously enough.
 
 - You should like my LBBs. They look so good on me. Why don't you like them? Please, rethink.
 
 - I think I am getting down to our personal things that I shouldn't be penning down like this. Let me compensate this with some poetry.
 
 - Whenever I think of or I have to, now that it is the demand of an occasion, word my feelings for you, I am reminded of a song by the band Tool. I may have sang it for you earlier also; I will quote it today again. The two lines that are deeper than two oceans:
 'What have I done to be the son (daughter) of an angel
 What have I done to be worthy'
 I still don't know.
 
 - I don't know if that's how everyone in this world feels about their mothers or is it just about you, you are the blessing one asks for. May the b'ful being that you are stays around me till the oceans run dry. You are the comfort I seek at the end of a calm day. You are the shelter I ask for at the end of a hurricane (Inspiration: Clemetine/Gorecki)
 
 Happy Mother's Day Mom!
