MUMBAI: “India, see you on 10th May!” is all that pop’s boy wonder   is willing to divulge for now but it ends months of speculation on whether or not Bieber fever will hit  . 

 Mumbai, it turns out, is the only Indian city that will witness the 22-year-old Canadian pop star’s debut in the country when he takes centrestage at the DY Patil Stadium in Nerul.
 
 Billed as the highest paid concert in India by far, Bieber’s show, supported by the Maharashtra Tourism Board is expected to cost around US$ 4 million, surpassing JLo and Shakira’s appearances at high-profile Indian weddings. The show’s organizer Arjun Jain, director of White Fox India, says, “Justin Bieber is the biggest mainstream artiste of our time and attracts fans across all ages. This   is one of the most successful in the world at the moment and will further enhance India’s current repertoire on the global map. We envisage one of the biggest live events of the year.”
 
 Apart from India, the Asia leg of the tour includes Tel Aviv in Israel and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates before Bieber arrives in India. Opening acts are likely to feature Sean Paul, Martin Garrix and Sean Kingston. 
 
 Tickets for Bieber’s Mumbai jaunt, in support of his fourth album ‘Purpose’ that was critically acclaimed and marked his move from bubble-gum pop to a mature zone, will go on sale from February 22.
