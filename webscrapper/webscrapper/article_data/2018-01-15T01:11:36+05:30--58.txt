 The talk, held in Green Park by the council, the NGO and a consulting firm, was conducted by AIIMS specialist Dr Prashun Chatterjee and his team. During the talk, he stressed that the seniors must keep their brains active and keep the cycle of learning to age actively. “Learn a new skill, language or even computers. Keep your right brain active by using your left hand more frequently,” advised the doctor to 50-odd seniors attending the talk.
 
 He advised that seniors should learn a new language or a musical instrument to keep their brain young and they should also get involved in social projects to keep a healthy circle of people around them and stay empathetic. “Depression too can lead to dementia, and it is important for older people to get help to prevent deterioration,” he advised.
 
 He also chalked out the difference between normal forgetfulness that accompanies ageing and dementia. “Forgetting small things is not troublesome. Dementia would be to forget basic things like meals or even falling often,” he said.
 
 Chatterjee said the screening test was a self-assessed test, with questions that would help the assessment team flag certain patients and take them up for further consultation. He added that the screening test would flag a possible patient if he/she has a hearing problem and is also forgetful.“While the goal is to try and prevent dementia, if it strikes, the caregivers must be made aware how to manage the condition,” said the doctor.
