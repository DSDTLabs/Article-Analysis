MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached 33 flats in a 26-storey "internationally designed" tower-LE88-at Bandra Reclamation as part of a money laundering probe against former   minister   and others. The value of the flats according to   is over Rs 460 crore. Officials said 90% of the tower which has 86 flats worth more than Rs 1,200 crore was illegally constructed after manipulating records and rules. 

  
  
 The case pertains to alleged irregularities in redevelopment of a slum, Jamaat-e-Jamhooria, Bandra, by Pyramid Developers.
 
 ED officials said most of the flats have been sold. Only 33 flats remained unsold, which the ED attached in the case. Officials said a local builder wanted to develop the slum, but since the area was under CRZ, he didn't find it feasible as only   1 was available on the plot. Siddique allegedly roped in his associate,  , along with Saleh Mithiborwala of Pyramid Developers to redevelop the area in 2002. Siddique (who became minister afterwards) was chairman of the Mhada board at the time.
 
 Pyramid manipulated records to inflate the number of slum-dwellers in the area with the help of forged ration cards and voter I-D cards. It helped the developer to get additional construction rights on the saleable component. According to officials, after rehabilitating the slum dwellers in seven buildings constructed under the SRA scheme, Pyramid was getting 2,283 sq mt for construction of flats to be sold in the market. It was to construct up to four floors.
