KOLKATA: There seems to be no end in sight to sufferings of passengers due to late running of trains to and from north India due to the dense fog between   and New Delhi. With logistics turning out to be a major problem, the railways is even considering the cancellation of some trains.

 “Since many flights have been cancelled, there has been a concerted effort to run as many trains as possible even if they are delayed. We have also attached additional First AC coaches to trains like the Howrah and   to accommodate air passengers whose flights get cancelled. There are also people who are boarding trains with waitlisted tickets and pleading to be accommodated. 
 
 On days, the Howrah and Sealdah Rajdhanis run with more people due to   passengers and additional coaches. This gives rise to problems with on-board catering and cleaning with Rajdhanis taking 13 hours to reach Kanpur from New Delhi and a further 11-odd hours to get to Mughalsarai. Unless a few trains are cancelled, the situation won’t improve,” a senior official said.
 
 
  
 The   that was to reach Howrah at 10am on Tuesday is running 16 hours late while the one to Sealdah arrived around 5pm, seven hours behind schedule. “The Sealdah Rajdhani’s timing has improved as an additional rake was introduced. All three rakes of the Howrah Rajdhani are already being run. The situation can improve if we can get Howrah or Sealdah-bound trains from New Delhi to cross Kanpur by 4am. The fog is normally the densest between 4 am and 11 am in that area,” the official added.
