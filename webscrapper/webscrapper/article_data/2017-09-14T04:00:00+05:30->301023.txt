New Delhi: India and Japan are expected to dig deep into their bilateral relationship, especially with an eye on converging their strategic and economic outlook to take it to the next level.

 As a detailed joint statement is still being worked out, the focus is on   and nuclear technologies as India is likely to finalize its first defence purchases from Japan, the US-2 amphibious plane that has been on the table for some years. Some element of ‘Make in India" may be introduced, but the two sides are looking at a future where joint development will be the key. Given the fact that bureaucracies in both countries are notoriously slow, this may still take a while, needing strong political push to get it off the starting block.
 
 On the other side, with the North Korean crisis deepening, Japan is looking for defence partnerships that deliver ballistic and cruise missiles, as was made clear by Katsuyuki Kawai, Abe’s top foreign policy adviser, who was in New Delhi last week.
 
 With the completion of the civil nuclear deal, India is looking for more collaboration between nuclear companies of the two countries. The deal was finally signed between India and Japan in November 2016, and the Japanese Parliament cleared it in June this year.
 
 The financial troubles of Westinghouse has necessitated a change in strategy. The Indian government will roll out the proverbial red carpet for the hundreds of Japanese nuclear companies which are in desperate need of markets, after the Fukushima disaster closed doors in Japan and many western countries. The model will be different from the Russian one, where the foreign partner builds entire reactors from scratch. Instead, Japanese companies like Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi and numerous smaller nuclear companies are being invited to invest and provide support services to Indian companies for designing, building and operating reactors.
