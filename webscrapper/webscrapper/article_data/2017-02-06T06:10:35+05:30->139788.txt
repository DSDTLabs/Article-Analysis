KOCHI: In an attempt to call the prime minister's bluff on  , CPM general secretary   urged the   to impose restrictions on corporate funding and to put a ceiling on election expenditure by political parties and not just candidates alone. 

 Inaugurating the valedictory session of the national conference of DYFI here on Sunday, Yechury said that corporates should make whatever contributions they want to the Union government which should then distribute it to political parties. Yechury, however, didn't enlighten the massive crowd in attendance at the rally on what matrix the government should adopt to disburse these funds to parties ranging from the   and   to those like the CPM which are in effect restricted to a few states.
 
  Yechury also contested the prime minister's definition of 'scam' made the other day with his own definition, saying that in the Sangh Parivar's lingo 'scam' stood for 'Scheduled Castes and Minorities'. He also alleged that the Union government insulted Parliament by rushing through with the budget hours after E Ahamed's death.
