The family feud within SP came to the fore in the   on Monday with party patriarch   and his brother   defying the party’s line by casting their vote in New Delhi and Lucknow, respectively, for NDA nominee Ram Nath  . Elsewhere, cross-voting by BJP, Trinamool and   legislators was reported from Gandhinagar and Agartala. In Chandigarh, AAP MLA H S   abstained from voting.

 AAP’s Phoolka did not toe the party line saying he would not vote for opposition nominee  . Shivpal said he cast his vote for Kovind as per Mulayam’s “advice” and claimed that many SP MLAs had also crossvoted.
 
 “People always like to go with the winner,” Shivpal said after casting his vote. When reminded of an ‘informal’ whip issued by SP to support Meira Kumar, Shivpal quipped: “What whip? I wasn’t even invited in the meeting.” UP CM Aditya Nath Yogi thanked both Mulayam and Shivpal for supporting Kovind. Independent MLA from Kunda, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya, who was a minister in Akhilesh government, too, announced that he voted for Kovind.
 
 In Agartala, six rebel TMC MLAs and one Congress legislator voted for Kovind saying their focus was to defeat the ruling Left Front in the Tripura assembly polls. “We are ready to go to any extent and make sacrifices to defeat the communists,” said leader of the rebel TMC group, Sudip Roy Barman.
 
 Congress MLA Ratan Lal Nath said: “There is no tradition of issuing a whip in the presidential election and MLAs and MPs are free to cast their votes for candidates of their choice. I preferred Kovindji.”
