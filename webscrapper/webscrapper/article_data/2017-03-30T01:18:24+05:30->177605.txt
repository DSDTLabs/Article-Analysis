NAVI MUMBAI: After creating a 3-km   along the Nerul main lake as part of the civic body’s waterfront development project in the first phase,   has now charted out yet another plan to develop a dedicated   for cycling enthusiasts and to promote the need for fitness and good health. 

  This cycle track would be the first-of-its-kind in Navi Mumbai, said civic sources.
 
 NMMC has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 5 crore to further develop Jewel of Navi Mumbai (Nerul waterfront), along Palm Beach Road in sector 26. 
 
  The second phase of the project will focus on developing a 2.5-km cycle track and a lawn along the subsidiary lake, a  , CCTVs, an obstacle course and an urban social forest.
 
 In the first phase, Rs 18 crore was spent on a jogging track, skating rink, garden, an open gym, an amphitheatre, planting of trees, statues and lighting. “Jewel of Navi Mumbai has emerged as a major recreation hub. Phase-II has been planned to add value to the area as thousands throng to this facility daily,” said city engineer Mohan Dagaonkar. 
 
 A walking trail will be yet another feature. People will be able to take a walk under the shade of trees as a large portion of the area has been reserved for a social urban forest. Cyclists will be able to pedal their way through the obstacle course (inclined-declined) in the forest area. 
 
  The small water body will be protected by the 2.5km cycle track and will have a fishing pond as well. Nerul resident Mandar Keni said, “I am unsure of the cycle track as it should have been developed with the jogging track.” The green patch next to the small lake will be converted into an urban forest. The work will start after administrative approval, Dagaonkar said.
