Madurai: The fire accident at Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple could have forced the city corporation to expedite work on the long-pending shopping complex project at the Kunnathur Chathiram site.  Mooted in the early 2000s, the foundation stone for the project was laid in 2006 when the tourism department proposed to renovate Pudhu Mandapam inside the temple complex. Temple authorities said that as many as 290 shopkeepers occupy Pudhu Mandapam and conduct their businesses. According to corporation officials, the detailed project report for the shopping complex is in the process of being prepared. “Consultants have been hired to prepared the DPR. We expect to have more clarity on the shopping complex project in two weeks,” the official said, suggesting that the DPR preparation is closer to completion. Madurai Corporation is executing the shifting as part of Smart Cities project. Corporation sources said that the proposed complex would have a basement and two more floors to accommodate the shopkeepers. “Parking facilities will be provided in the basement. Vehicles and shops will share the basement in half,” a senior corporation official said. The potential shifting process has excited shopkeepers in Pudhu Mandapam. “We have been keen on moving to the new complex for the last seven or eight years. But they never built it. If they do build it, it will have to accommodate all the shops because the livelihoods of thousands of families are at stake,” said G Muthu Pandi, president, Traders and Tailoring Labourers' Association of Pudhu Mandapam. However, not all are happy. Shopkeepers in the Veera Vasantharaya mandapam, which was damaged partially in the fire accident, told TOI that they would resist moves to evict them from the temple. “The temple is where our business is,” said one of the affected shopkeeper.
