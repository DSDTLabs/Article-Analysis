NEW DELHI: The President accepted   high court judge Justice Jayant M Patel’s resignation on Friday, a week after he put in his papers following the   collegium’s decision to shift him to  .

 “The President had forwarded Justice Patel’s resignation to the   for the government’s view. After receiving the advice, the President has accepted the resignation and it has been notified,” a law ministry source told TOI.
 
 Asked whether the ministry had received the collegium’s recommendation transferring Justice Patel to Allahabad HC and four other HC judges to their parent HCs, sources said no such recommendation was received by the government.
 
 In fast-paced developments last week, the collegium initially decided to move Justice Patel to Bombay HC and a few days later, it opted to transfer him to Allahabad HC which forced his hand. Justice Patel would have become acting chief justice of Karnataka HC on retirement of incumbent S K Mukherjee on October 10.
 
 SC sources told TOI that Justice Patel, appointed as an HC judge on December 3, 2001, would have been the fourth most senior judge in Bombay HC, which could have been criticised as an attempt to dilute his seniority. If Justice Patel had joined Allahabad HC, the biggest HC with a current strength of 109 judges, he would have been the senior-most judge after after CJ D B Bhosale.
 
 The decision to transfer Justice Patel and his resignation has provided grist to simmering criticism of the collegium’s ‘opaque and arbitrary’ functioning.
