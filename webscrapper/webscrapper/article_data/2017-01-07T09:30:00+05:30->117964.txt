KOLKATA: CBI officers on Friday claimed that the state CID team was trying to gather information about Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay’s arrest by sending a team to Bhubaneswar. The team also reportedly visited certain places in that city to gather information on the arrest of Tapas Paul, another MP.

 The CID, though, denied reports of any of its team visiting Bhubaneswar and said they would instead be writing to the “concerned authorities” (read the state administration) about how   owner   had violated his parole conditions and tried to meet influential persons towards the end of December in the name of arranging treatment for his mother. The state is mulling legal advice on whether they can forward the same to CBI and ED. 
 
 Sources said Kundu was granted parole from December 20 to December 22 last year when he informed the court that his mother was ill. The court granted the parole and said he can visit a certain hospital where his mother would receive treatment. But Kundu allegedly admitted his mother to another hospital in   where he “met certain influential men”. The court took cognizance of the development and said it was “unsatisfied” with the reports submitted by Kundu regarding the illness of his mother. Even on Friday, a local court rejected the bail plea of Kundu hinting it wants to know about his movements when he was on parole.
 
 Kundu’s lawyers denied the state agency’s claims and said all conditions of parole was fulfilled. “We have documents that have been forwarded in court. Kundu has always co-operated during the probe and followed orders. One must remember that his father had passed away and he was merely fulfilling the duty of a son towards his mother,” said one of his lawyers.
 
 CID claimed it had been “looking” in to the Rose Valley case after an FIR was filed in Jalpaiguri. . “But we reiterate that no one from CID was in Bhubaneswar,” he said.
