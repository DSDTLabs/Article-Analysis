NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Monday   chief minister   to call for   in connection with a   filed against him by Union finance minister Arun  .

 However, Justice Manmohan made it clear that the court is allowing Kejriwal’s plea to summon only two documents of February 10, 2003 and April 6, 2003, with which Jaitley can be confronted during his cross-examination and not the entire DDCA report.
 
 The CM had sought to summon entire minutes of meetings of the cricket body between 1999 and 2013, when Jaitley was president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). But HC declined, noting that it can’t understand how the minutes of that time are relevant to the defamation suit against Kejriwal. Moreover, no grounds were given by the chief minister for summoning the details it added.
 
 The court also took note of one of the sessions involving the Union minister’s cross-examination on Kejriwal’s behalf and noted that the questions put to Jaitley were not relevant to the case and the questioners should have restrained themselves.
 
 HC said it is not clear in which direction the cross examination is proceeding which is going on before a joint registrar (JR), who has directed Kejriwal’s team of lawyers to wind up the cross examination by February 12.
 
 As regards the documents which have been allowed to be summoned, the court asked Kejriwal to file a proper application in two days. Its order came on Kejriwal’s appeal challenging the JR’s order dismissing his plea to summon the minutes of meeting of DDCA and the other two documents. Kejriwal is facing a Rs 10 crore defamation case filed by Jaitley where apart from him, five other AAP leaders have also been arraigned.
