MUMBAI: A group of 20 men in khaki listen with rapt attention as an instructor explains how to use a   kit to collect  . They are among 100 cops being trained, in batches, at the Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories ( ), Kalina, in collection of forensic evidence. As part of the training, the cops visit a crime scene and observe how forensic analysis would be done back at the laboratory. After the training, a group of two to three police personnel will be allotted per district. They would travel in a mobile forensic van equipped with 17 kits to collect samples of  ,  , narcotics,  ,   from crime scenes. Forty five mobile forensic vans have been provided (one for each police commissionerate) in the state for accurate collection of forensic evidence.

 “The vans were ready at least two years ago and the state spent close to Rs 40 lakh on them. But there were no staffers available to use them,“ said an official. “The objective behind allotting the vans is to ensure that forensic evidence could be collected scientifically from the crime scene, before it got contaminated due to human error or natural elements like water.“
 
 The 20-day training for the second batch kicked off on September 6, while the first batch passed out in July . Assistant scientific officers are the ones who collect forensic evidence from crime scene. But the DFSL is low on manpower. “We had started to call back some retired employees for the job. It was later decided to rope in police personnel and train them to collect samples accurately , to be brought to the lab for testing,“ said DG (Legal and Technical) SPS Yadav . Besides a bachelors degree in science (preferably in chemistry), the trainees are required to have knowledge of computers and English. Director General of Police Satish Mathur is believed to have handpicked policemen for the training.
 
 The government has now sanctioned 45 positions for assistant scientific officers. But the recruitment would take time.
