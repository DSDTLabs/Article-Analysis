KOLKATA: Tunnel borer   on Friday crossed the last hurdle on the Howrah-Esplanade stretch and passed below 11, Government Place — the last of the seven “very poor condition” buildings in the central business district.

 Workers employed at the shops housed in the building returned and opened shutters on Friday morning. On Tuesday, they were asked to stay away while the tunnelboring machine was drilling below the wobbly structure.
 
 Since the building has commercial establishments only, none had to be shifted to a hotel.
 
  ( ), the agency implementing the Rs 8,575-crore Metro corridor between  , has had many ups and downs ever since it started boring from the Howrah end. The start itself was shaky as the Howrah District Library developed cracks during the boring. However, there has been no looking back since then.
 
 Prerna and Rachna, the twin TBMs, went on to successfully drill below the Hooghly, the congested Brabourne Road and BBD Bag, which is dotted with heritage structures. KMRC had identified seven crumbling structures in Dalhousie for evacuation to avoid accidents while the TBMs bore 22m underneath.
 
 The TBMs have passed several “very poor condition” buildings, with seven century-old structures lined up along Rachna’s path being the worst. The five on the right of   – on Old Court House Street — were evacuated in January. One of the two buildings on the left of the hotel – on Government Place East — was evacuated on Wednesday. The structure, built circa 1870 by  , a British manufacturing confectioner appointed by the Queen of  , had to be grouted and strengthened over the last three days. Lalit Great Eastern hotel has been marked as an “important” building falling along the east-bound or the Salt Lake-bound tunnel being dug by Rachna. The other important structure that this TBM will pass by is Esplanade Mansion.
