NAGPUR: Displaying exemplary and instinctive techniques, the Railway Protection Force ( ) rescued a 40-year-old man stuck in the gap between the edge of the platform and a running   on Friday around 9.30pm.

 “Ajay Mishra, a native of Jhansi, wanted to board Rajdhani Express from platform No. 1. However, he failed to check the train number and mistakenly attempted to board Yashwantpur-Gorakhpur Express (train No. 15024),” RPF constable Vikas Sharma told TOI.
 
 “As the train started to depart, Ajay, who was holding a laptop bag and a trolley bag, lost his grip from the handle while getting inside,” Sharma added.
 
 A team of six RPF staffers reached the spot within 20 seconds as they heard some screaming travellers. They instructed Ajay to remain steady and as close as to the edge of the platform. The cops said three boogies passed from him.
 
 In the meantime, one of the cops entered the train and pulled down the chain. As the train stopped, the cops went to the other side through the boogie and pulled him out from the gap of two wheels.
 
 Sharma carried Ajay on his shoulders to the RPF police station. Ajay fell unconscious due to fear, the police said. An ambulance was also summoned to the spot after a while.
 
 Police informed Ajay’s brother Sanjay, who lives in Koradi, from Ajay’s cell phone. Ajay was admitted to a private hospital at Mankapur where he is still recuperating. Ajay has sustained severe internal chest injuries and bruises on the body.
 
 Expressing gratitude to RPF team, Sanjay told TOI, “A thanks is a very small gesture. Our family is indebted to RPF. Our faith in police services, especially humanity, has been restored.” 
 
 Earlier in the day, a coolie prevented a woman from jumping in front of a train along with her toddler daughter and son (6).
