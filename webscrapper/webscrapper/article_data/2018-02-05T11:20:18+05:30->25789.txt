Despite all the controversies that made headlines throughout 2017, revolving around a couple of actors,   seems to have put all that behind and moved on, quite literally! So much so that at a fashion gathering on Sunday, Kangana chose to share her marriage plans with the media. 

  The National award-winning actress, who walked the ramp as the showstopper for a designer duo’s collection that had fairy-tale wedding as its theme, was asked as to when she is planning on tying the knot. To that, Kangana casually replied, “Which month is going on? February? Give me time till next February. I will do it in February 2019.” However, the ‘Queen’ actress did not reveal the identity of the person she would want to get married to or if there is someone in her life already. But if there is any truth to this comment, then it's a great news for her fans and Bollywood in general.
 
  Other than delving personal details, Kangana also spoke about her upcoming period drama ‘Manikarnika: The   of Jhansi’. “’Manikarnika’ was set to release in April, but because of the VFX we are planning to release it by the end of the year. My producers will announce it soon.”
 
  Dressed in a light greyish gown, with a colour-coordinated headdress to finish the look, Kangana looked ethereal and her make-up was also kept to a bare minimum to let her natural beauty shine through.
