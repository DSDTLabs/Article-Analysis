HYDERABAD: Telangana   ( ) chief   has accused chief minister   of cheating unemployed youth in the state. After 33 months in power, KCR ran out of excuses for not fulfilling his election promise to provide lakhs of government jobs to unemployed youth, he said.

 Addressing a public meeting `Jana Avedana Sabha' in Shadnagar on Sunday , he said KCR appeared mentally disturbed due to the rising public discontent against his government. “Having realised that he could not cheat or mislead people any more, the CM has now turned to God for refuge.“
 
 “The arrogance of power has made KCR to even forget God. For the same reason, he did not remember the vows that he made to God for almost 33 months. But the recent agitation organised by the   and the support it got from people refreshed KCR's memory and he started recalling the vows, one after the other. However, KCR is making a mistake of misusing public money to fulfill his personal vows,“ he said.
 
 Uttam asked the CM to clarify whether or not, during the election campaign, he promised one job for each household in the state. He said when previous Congress regime wanted to fill nearly one lakh vacancies, TRS stalled the process and said jobs should be given only after formation of Telangana.
 
 “KCR only delivers long speeches and tries to cover up his failures with story-telling. Having exhausted his entire vocabulary , now he has started using abusive and derogatory language against Congress leaders,“ he said adding that the TRS government must realise that it has completed nearly three years in power and it could no more indulge in blame game against the Congress.
