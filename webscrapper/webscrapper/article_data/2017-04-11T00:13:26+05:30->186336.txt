MUMBAI:   police arrested a 30-year-old man last Saturday for allegedly blackmailing his ex-girlfriend and threatening to throw   on her face if she did not continue their relationship. He also told the girl that he would upload their video on social media. 

 Investigators said Milind Dharia and the complainant, a 22-year-old commerce student from a south Mumbai college, were in a relationship for three years. “The girl broke off with Dharia in February and since then has been harassing her,” said an officer. After the break-up, the girl started meeting another man. This, said police, enraged Dharia and he started threatening her. “The complainant told us that there was a video of her and Dharia together on his phone when they were seeing each other. Dharia had deleted the video and retrieved it again. After the break-up, he started threatening to make the video go viral if she did not continue their relationship,” said an officer.
 
 Dharia had also threatened to throw acid on her face if she broke off with him. “After their break-up, Dharia learned the girl had befriended another person, she he got his number and called him up to talk about the girl. He showed him their old video, stored in his cell phone, and allegedly passed remarks which outraged the girl’s modesty. Dharia told him that before the girl befriended him, she was seeing him and presented the video as proof. The new friend informed the girl about his conversation with Dharia and that he had seen her video,” added a police source.
 
 This is where the girl decided to approach the police. “She told us that Dharia had been harassing her. We have registered a case against Dharia and arrrested him,” said the police. When produced before a court, the magistrate remanded him in judicial custody. Police are trying to find out other details and said they will send Dharia’s phone for analysis.
