Vadodara: Last year,   Pathan had captained Baroda T20 team in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. But the medium pacer has been dropped from the team for the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 west zone tournament that will begin in Rajkot from January 7. 

 Munaf Patel too wasn’t considered for the team while Yusuf opted out of the tournament. 
 
 The selectors have instead given opportunity to three youngsters in the team. Former India keeper, Nayan Mongia’s son Mohit Mongia, Ninad Rathwa and Urvil Patel will make their debut in the T20 tournament. “All the three play for Baroda U-19 team and have performed well. The selectors are in process of rebuilding the team and they believe in giving chance to performing youngsters,” said Snehal Parikh, BCA secretary (in-charge). 
 
 Irfan was dropped unceremoniously from the Baroda Ranji team in October last year after being made captain of the squad. Yusuf was unwell so he too played in just two Ranji matches. “Yusuf was on medication and he had sent the prescription to the BCCI as is required according to the rules. He was advised to not play till January 10. He called up and informed us about it. So he has not been picked up for the T20 team,” Parikh told TOI. 
 
 The T20 squad will be led by Deepak Hooda while Atit Sheth will be the vice-captain. Kedar Devdhar, Swapnil Singh, Vishnu Solanki, Dhiren Mistry, Krunal Pandya, Abhijeet Karambelkar, Shoeb Tai, Lukman Meriwala, Rishi Arothe and Dhruv Patel have also been picked up in the squad.
