ULHASNAGAR: In an interesting development before   election, two   local leaders who have filed two   cases against Ulhasnagar strongman Pappu Kalani's son   have withdrawn their complaints. 

 Both leaders on Friday submitted their affidavit in Kalyan session court saying the cases registered by them against Omie was politically motivated.

 During last UMC election, Omie Kalani and Manoj Lassi with their associates on two occasions had assaulted Sukhramani and Kalwani, asking Sukhramani to ask her aunty Neetu Sukharamani to not contest civic election against Omie's mother Jyoti Kalani. 
 
 After the case was registered Omie and Lassi had surrendered before the court which had remanded them to jail. 
 
 Later, Omie and others had managed to get bail from Kalyan session court on the basis of former Thane police commissioner K P Raghuvanshi's report to the state government in which he had claimed case registered against Omie and other were politically motivated. 
 
 Omie is the son of Ulhasnagar's strongman and former four-times MLA Pappu Kalani who is serving life term in jail in a murder case.
