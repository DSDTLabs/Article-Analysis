PATNA: Around three and a half months after joining Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in his ‘padyatra’ in Champaran region, leader of opposition in assembly   on Sunday said he would soon begin another ‘yatra’ from Mahatma Gandhi’s ‘karmabhoomi’. The proposed yatra would be organized to expose the “recent assassination of public mandate” in Bihar, he said.

 Reciting a couplet from Ramdhari Singh Dinkar’s famous ‘Rashmirathi’ — ‘Yachna nahin ab ran hoga (time of request is over, now it will a war) — Tejashwi said the RJD would begin the yatra from Champaran and go to other parts of the state to expose Nitish Kumar’s pre-planned design to rejoin hands with the BJP and also to mobilize public for the party’s ‘BJP bhagao rally’ in Patna on August 27.
 
 Tejashwi’s political aide Sanjay Yadav said though the date for the Champaran yatra is yet to be finalized, but most probably it will begin between August 5 and 8.
 
 Sources in the RJD said the party was making preparations to ensure massive turnout of supporters during Tejashwi’s Champaran yatra.
 
 Tejashwi had participated in a 7km-long padyatra with CM Nitish and Congress state president Ashok Choudhary as part of the centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran satyagrah. The padyatra, organized by the state government, was held on April 18 from Chandrahia village to Motihari town to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi’s journey on April 18, 1917.
 
 On April 18, 1917, when Mahatma Gandhi had undertaken a journey on elephant from Motihari to Jasauli Patti village in the then undivided Champaran district of Bihar in order to listen to the indigo farmers about their plight, he had been prohibited by a British magistrate at Chandrahia from travelling any further. Resultantly, Gandhi had to return to Motihari, which is now the district headquarters of East Champaran.
