ROORKEE:  , the daughter of a TV mechanic in  , has scripted a success story after she topped the   (GATE) 2018 in Computer Science Engineering. The 26-year-old did not let her humble background come into the way of her dreams and worked for three years at a private company to fund her coaching.
 
  Today, her hard work has paid off, said Kalra even as she greeted yet another of the well-wishers who have been queuing outside her house in Satti Mohalla since the results were declared on March 16. “I hope to join IIT-Bombay so I can pursue a career in I-T research,” Namita told TOI on Sunday.
  
  Namita completed her BTech in computer science engineering from the   in Srinagar. After earning her degree, she worked in a private company in Ludhiana for three years so she could save up for coaching classes.
  
  “I had appeared for GATE during the final year of college as well. That is when I realized that I needed systematic preparation and coaching for GATE. But we were a family of modest means and my father, Devendra Kalra, was the sole breadwinner. So I took up a job at a private company. I left my job last year and started preparing for the engineering exam,” she said.
