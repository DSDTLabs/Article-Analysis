LUCKNOW: The stray leopard at   village, although confined to a field, is yet to be caught even as the second day of the operation drew to a close on Friday. The rescue team has raised three layers of net, the last one being the highest, to check the big cat from jumping out, in case it tries to, during the rescue operation. 

 "We requested the army to provide   and   for the rescue effort," said chief conservator, Awadh, K Pravin Rao. The net has been so raised that it has encircled the open space in a ground where cemented sewer pipes have been lying and the big cat is localised.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Three cages have been put inside the enclosure formed by the nets. The part of the net outside the cages has been covered with black and green polythene sheets to keep the feline protected from the outside disturbance and give it a feeling of being in a secure environment. It is only when it feels safe that it would come out. Meat and water have been put inside each of the cages to lure the big cat.
 
 The leopard has not shown up since Friday morning though locals said they heard it roar. Lucknow zoo's rescue team and   officers have been camping at the spot. The ground where the big cat has been localised is a perfect hideout as it has pits dug by strays where the leopard can stay without being spotted.
