BAREILLY: In an attempt to provide better services to its passengers, the   (UPSRTC) will be initiating the process of replacement of its old/damaged buses with the new buses, from February this year. The corporation has set a target to add 100 new roadways buses every month to its fleet and restrict the operation of its dilapidated buses. 
 
  The proposal was passed in a recent board meeting and those vehicles, which have been plying on roads for over 10 years, will be made off-road. The 100 new buses will be mostly ordinary roadways buses, which will come up at an estimated cost of around Rs 21 lakh per bus, said officials at UPSRTC.
  
  Speaking with TOI, UPSRTC assistant regional manager   said, “The UPSRTC has around 12,500 buses in its existing feet, however, there are several buses in the department that are over-aged and need to be replaced. Therefore, the corporation has set a target to replace the dilapidated vehicles and add 100 new buses every month from next month. The buses, which are 9-10 years old and continue to operate, will be made off-road thereafter.”
  
    added, “The concerned regional offices will be identifying the number of roadways buses in their respective regions, that are old and need to be replaced and in this way, 100 buses in total will be added to the corporation’s entire fleet every month. The corporation will be purchasing these buses from a private company while the old buses will be auctioned.”
