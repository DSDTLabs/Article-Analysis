HYDERABAD: The   collegium has cleared the names of four senior district judges, Dr Shameem Akthar, J Uma Devi, T Rajani and N Balayogi for appointment as   judges. While Balayogi is currently chief judge of Hyderabad city civil courts, Uma Devi is chief judge with small causes court in the civil courts complex. Shameem Akthar is working as judicial registrar in the high court and Rajani is the current metropolitan sessions judge of Hyderabad.
