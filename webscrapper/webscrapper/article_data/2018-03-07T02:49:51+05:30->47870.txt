NEW DELHI: A seven-month-old   girl was charred to death with her parents and grandmother in a horrific incident early on Tuesday, when their car's engine caught fire at the Karnal bypass after a collision with a truck. The family was heading back to their house in west Delhi's Hari Nagar after a short vacation in Amritsar, when the accident took place. 

  Police said the matter was reported around 4am, when a passerby made a PCR call. The bodies were pulled out and rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared all of them dead. Cops said that the victims were possibly trapped in the vehicle as the doors could have jammed post-collision. 
 
 The victims were identified as Sanchit (22), Bhavna (24), Tusharika (7 months) and   (47).A police officer said the car jumped a divider on the highway and collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction, after which it caught fire. Fire tenders were rushed to the spot but all occupants of the car were charred before help reached.
 
 Sanchit and Bhavna had married a year ago. Bhola was Bhavna's mother and was accompanying the three as she really wanted to visit the Golden Temple.
 
 Sanchit's father   said that they left home for Amritsar on Thursday. In Amritsar, they came across Bhavna's cousins and made a spontaneous plan to go to Kullu Manali to celebrate Holi. They went to the hill station and dropped the cousins back in Amritsar late on Monday and left for Delhi. On their way, they met with the accident.
