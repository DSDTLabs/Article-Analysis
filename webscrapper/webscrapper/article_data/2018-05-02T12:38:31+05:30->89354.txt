HYDERABAD: The   (JSP) will contest all 175 assembly seats in   in the 2019 elections. Announcing this on Tuesday, party president Pawan Kalyan said the Jana Sena's strategy for the elections in Telangana will be announced in August. 

 "I planned to contest in 70-80 assembly constituencies and eight Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections, but I had to support the NDA because of the prevailing circumstances then. This time around, the   will contest all the 175 assembly seats in AP," Pawan Kalyan said during an interaction with party activists in Hyderabad.
 
 The sudden announcement made by the JSP president a year before the elections comes as a bit of a surprise. Analysts say one of the reasons could be to make it clear that Pawan will not align with the BJP or the TDP. 
 
 He has, of late, hobnobbed with the communist parties, but the announcement that the JSP will contest from all seats means there would be no seats arrangement or alliance with the Left parties. However, since the Left parties are strong in some places in Telangana, it possibly could mean that the JSP will work its strategy accordingly to back the candidates of Left parties in Telangana.
 
 Pawan Kalyan will also begin a tour of Andhra Pradesh, the schedule for which will be announced before May 11. Pawan Kalyan has also hired the services of a chief political strategist, who he introduced as Dev, and said he had been working for the party for the last 10 months. 
 
 In the 2014 elections, Pawan Kalyan campaigned for the Telugu Desam Party and BJP candidates. He, however, fell out with both the TDP and the ruling BJP at the Centre on the issue of special category status for AP. "Jana Sena does not represent a single caste. If so, we would not have supported the TDP," he said about the party extending support to the TDP in the past.
