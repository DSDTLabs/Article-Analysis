BHUBANESWAR: The opposition members on Thursday disrupted the assembly proceedings alleging that the government had rehabilitated its leaders, who could not win the 2014 assembly election, as presidents of governing body of various colleges.

 The Congress and the BJP members raised the issue when higher education minister   was responding to a question by Congress MLA  .
 
 Speaking to reporters outside the assembly, BJP MLA   said ideally educationists should head the college bodies. However, the government has appointed the ruling party MLAs as chairpersons of the committees. In places where the sitting MLAs belong to other political parties, the BJD has rehabilitated its defeated MLA candidates in the college committees. Echoing similar views, Congress MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati said the government is using the colleges as a rehabilitation centre for the ruling party politicians, spoiling the academic ambience.
