Ace cinematographer Ravi K Chandran’s son, Santhanakrishnan, has replaced   cameraman   in the film. Interestingly, 23-year-old   has not assisted his dad, but has worked as an assistant to cinematographer   earlier. Santhanakrishnan says, “Gautham is very cool and he is quite clear about what he wants. He gives a lot of freedom on the set. He said that he wants the frame to be young and energetic.” About not taking camera lessons from dad, he says, “If you work with your family, you will not get the seriousness of the job. So I chose to work with Ravi Varman sir. But dad’s guidance is always there. He has told me to have a vision for the story while handling the camera.”
