Thane: Distressed farmers seem to have earned the empathy of urban residents. As thousands of farmers, waving red flags, strode into Thane on Saturday night, residents milled on to the streets to interact with them, some eagerly clicking selfies with them and others offering   and  .

 The Thane Matadata Jagran Manch provided nearly 500kg of food grains to the farmers who camped for the night at BMC octroi ground. “We had been in touch with the protestors since the rally started from Nashik on Tuesday. The organizers had refused to accept donation, but we were determined to help them as we are aware how they struggle to ensure food on our plate,” said Unmesh Bagawe from the group. 
 
 Another group, through a social messaging app, mobilized footwear for the farmers after reading about their blistered feet. “We were shocked to see the farmers walk barefoot on the highway. Some of us removed our footwear and offered it to the women, while others decided to donate shoes the following day,” said Nita Karnik, a resident of Flower Valley who volunteered to deliver 100 pairs of shoes.
 
 A few residents from Mulund showered flowers on the marchers as they started leaving Thane city limits on Sunday morning. “We are humbled by the love showered on us by Thane residents...We are happy that those living in the city have understood the plight of poor farmers living in villages,” said AIKS state secretary Ajit Navale. “We hope the government accepts our demands too.”
