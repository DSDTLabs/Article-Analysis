It all started with an old letter   found in his father’s drawer, 12 years after he died. The faded text opened a window into the life and times of his great grandfather   (ATW) Penn, one of the earliest photographers in south India, back in the 1800s. Christopher, 80, embarked on a journey that has produced one of the most comprehensive documentations of the photographic work of ATW Penn and the   in British India. 

 Christopher presented stunning black and white shots by ATW Penn as part of his talk, ‘In the footsteps of the   Brothers and ATW Penn – 19th century south Indian photographers’, organised by the INTACH Chennai chapter at Amethyst. Among them were exquisite pictures of the old Madras Club, Mahabalipuram Shore Temple and letters lauding the Higginbotham’s book shop for its fascinating collection of Aristotle, Socrates and  .
 
 “But among his works, I consider his ethnographic pictures to be the most important,” says Christopher. ATW Penn’s stunning portraits of the Toda community, the haunting depiction of a starvation-hit people blankly staring into the camera during the famine of 1876-78, or their gathering in hordes at a famine relief camp in Bangalore, provide insights into the socio-cultural narrative of India in the late 19th century. Christopher went on to write a book, ‘The Nicholas Brothers & ATW Penn: Photographers of South India 1855-1885’, published in 2014.
 
 “A lot of my research has been guesswork,” says Christopher. “I believe ATW Penn learnt photography from the Nicholas brothers because when he arrived in Madras, he was already a trained photographer. In the late 1880s however, letters written by him show that business got hit after Kodak swept away the mystique of photography by introducing cameras through which anyone could take photos and send films to be processed by them. From what was once magic, photography became something anyone could do,” he says.
