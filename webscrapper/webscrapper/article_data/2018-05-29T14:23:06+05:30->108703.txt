VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority ( ) deposited a compensation amount of about Rs 33 lakh in the court with regards to the 144-acre land in   that has been entangled in legal disputes for several years now. 

 
 
 Speaking to the media here in the Vuda office on Monday, Vuda vice chairman P Basanth Kumar informed that municipal administration and urban development minister P Narayana, during a recent review meeting in Visakhapatnam, had directed Vuda officials to take immediate action over the land.
 
 “Vuda has acquired about 144 acres of land in Vepagunta in 1981 and 1982. Some ryots had then approached the court and the cases were later dismissed. A government order, released in 1990, stated that the compensation amount awarded to be apportioned between Inamdars, i.e.   and the tenants in 1:2 ratio. However, later, in another order in 2015, the state government declared the Devasthanam as the undisputed and rightful owner before the acquisition. Three writ petitions filed by the ryots are still pending in the court. Pendurthi MLA B   has agreed to assist Vuda in settling the issues with the farmers,” said Basanth Kumar.
 
 Basanth Kumar said, even though Vuda is the rightful owner of the land, they are considering providing a suitable compensation to the encroachers and sharecroppers of the land. “Out of the total 144 acre land, about 47 acres of the land is lying vacant and about 60 acres of land is being cultivated. “A housing colony has also sprung up. The land will open new development avenue and about Rs 400 crore project to the Vuda. It will be a win-win situation for the tenants, encroachers and sharecroppers as the project will allow systematic development,” said Basanth Kumar.
