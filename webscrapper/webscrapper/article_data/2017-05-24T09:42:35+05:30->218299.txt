BHOPAL: If senior Samajwadi Party leader   can drive cops to look for his missing buffaloes in UP, then why should the party’s Rajya Sabha MP in Madhya Pradesh   let go of his  ?

 The men in khaki went out and about the green pastures and woodlands of Vidisha for two days, turning over every rock, so to speak, looking for the local MP’s precious goats. 
 
 All 23 of them. It’s not known if the search got anyone’s goat but orders and orders, and the cops goat… er got a leg-up when they found two of them in a village named Dhanaura, a few kilometres from Salim’s farmhouse. The goats were possibly stolen on Sunday night, and the FIR was lodged with Vidisha police on Monday. 
 
 The farm is around 10km from the   station, near Berkhedi village. The caretakers came to know about the theft on Monday morning and informed police even as they took off on the goat hunt. When the caretakers said that the goats were worth Rs 1.3 lakh each, the police truly goat going.
 
 “We rounded up a few people but could not find the stolen goats. Some people saw the goats being lifted during the night but did not inform police,” Civil Lines police station in-charge H S Rajawat, who is in charge of the investigation, told TOI.
 
 “We were eventually able to recover 15 goats from the jungles of Murwara, around 10km from the police station, on Tuesday. Three carcasses were found in the same area. it seemed they were attacked by dogs. Now, only three are missing.” It seems the robbers made off with three goats in their laps because that’s all they could carry, he added. “They probably escaped for fear of getting caught.”
 
 The MP heaved a sigh of relief. “Most of them were found. These were of a rare species. Though some animals were hurt by the dogs, police and even common people helped a lot in finding the goats,” Saleem told TOI.
