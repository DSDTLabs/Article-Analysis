VISAKHAPATNAM: A new variety of paddy is being introduced in Visakha Agency to double the yields. 

 According to experts from Chintapalli Agriculture Research Station, the new hybrid developed by a private firm is a hardy one and is also pest-resistant, requires less water and can be directly seed-planted. Scientists pointed that unlike traditional crop varieties such as Samba Masuri and  , the new variety under test conditions based on paddy cultivation practices in the sloping areas of the agency has shown a 100% increase in crop yield.
 
 Scientist R Sekhar said, “This variety is being extensively introduced in Chintapalli, Paderu, and Araku in Visakhapatnam district along with tribal zones in Salur and Makkuva agencies of Vizianagaram.”
 
 Regarding the key features of this variety, Sekhar noted that it was resistant to Bacterial Blight, more recipient to nutrients and fertiliser, requires less water and is more adaptable. Speaking on the extent of land needed to cultivate the variety, joint director of agriculture, Visakhapatnam, V Satyanarayana said, “This variety has been planted on 5,000 hectares in Visakha Agency and on a smaller extent in  .” Scientists at Chintapalli added that the new variety is most suitable for semi-dry cultivation on slopes and is becoming popular because it is also an easy to plant variety.
 
  Unlike the traditional practice of growing a nursery and then planting the crop, this seeds of this variety can be directly planted directly, saving on time and labour costs, they added.
 
 Gemmili Lachayya, a farmer from Rodda valasa village in Pachipenta mandal, who planted this variety, said, “The main advantage is the duration. The crop matures in less than 100 days making it a three-month variety and allows me enough time to sow my second crop, which is usually a dry crop. It saves me at least 20 days in comparison with traditional varieties.”
