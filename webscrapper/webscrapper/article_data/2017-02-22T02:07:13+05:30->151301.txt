 Gupta, who is the leader of the opposition in  , said that AAP has criticised the central government for presenting the budget on February 1. The ruling party in Delhi has demanded that the budget be presented after the elections in five states. “But now, they have taken a U-turn. The plan was to go ahead and pass a full-fledged budget. We want that the government should present a vote-on-account,” said Gupta.
 
 BJP says that AAP, which will contest the municipal elections for the first time, will present a populist budget to mislead the people of Delhi.
 
 Gupta said the Delhi government had presented a vote-on-account in place of a full-fledged budget in 2013 before the assembly elections. “But the   government proposes to present the budget before the notification of municipal polls so that it can garner support in the civic elections,” said Gupta.
