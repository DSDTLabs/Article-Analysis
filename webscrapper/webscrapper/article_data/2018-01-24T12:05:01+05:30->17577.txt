SHIMLA:   Chief Minister   has asked the officials to explain reasons for less   under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. He has issued directions to crackdown heavily on the drug and mining mafia in the state. He said that drugs of types whether conventional or psychotropic were a serious challenge before the police and a concrete plan was required to nip the drug mafia.

 Thakur said that the Police needs to restore and rebuild its image. After few cases of rape and murder in the state during the previous government regime and the way the cases were handled the police earned a bad name. The Chief Minister said that now with change of the rule, the people were having more expectations from the new government and the police with its community schemes needs to win the lost faith. Let not the people hesitate to seek help of the police, he said. The police friendly initiatives need to be undertaken.
 
 Showing his concern over the increased deaths due to accidents in the state, Thakur said that a plan needs to be formulated to strict traffic rules. Though the interception vans can be deployed on national highways and few other places but the drunken driving and driving while listening to mobiles should be checked upon immediately, he said, adding that Police needs to be strict on these issues and ensure that the traffic rules are obeyed by people.
 
 He also directed to work in direction of launching 'Hoshiar Singh Helpline'. He said that Himachal Pradesh should be the first state to launch 112, a toll free number for emergency, ambulance, fire and police. The government of India had issued directions in this regard to the states to make it operational.
