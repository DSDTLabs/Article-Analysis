NAGPUR: Even as   has successfully removed most of the encroachments from its 7.72 acre land on Amravati Road over last two decades, the Panjabrao Deshmukh Agriculture University (PDKV) has failed to do so on its Kachipura land. A huge 65.95 acre in the prime locality between Bajaj Nagar Square and Ramdaspeth has been encroached since the last four decades or so.

 In reply to an RTI query by activist Abhay Kolarkar, PDKV informed that it has about 410.20 hectare in its name, of which 350.72 hectare is in its possession while 59.48 hectare has been allotted to various state and central departments. Another 3.92 hectare land is also in its possession, but it’s not in its name. The university is one of the biggest landholders in Nagpur city, with much of the 410.20 hectares in upmarket and prime areas like Sitabuldi, Ambazari and Ramdaspeth.
 
 NU had sought direct help from its alumni and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for removal of encroachments, after its own officials had failed to clear the land even after clear directives from the Nagpur bench of  . It was only after the CM’s directives that the authorities from collectorate and even the revenue department swung into action and cleared encroachers by removing their illegal structures. However, PDKV authorities were found lacking in this aspect.
 
 “We’re trying our level best to clear them. But our hands are tied since various litigations are pending, right from tehsildar to high court and Supreme Court. We’ve also written to the government for help in this regard. Additionally, we had issued letters to MSEDCL, NMC and water works department against providing any connections to the people residing in the area, or to the 67 commercial establishments operating on the encroached stretch of Central Bazaar Road,” PDKV estate officer   told TOI.
 
 He added that they had also roped in a good lawyer and filed caveats in all courts, so that encroachers don’t get favourable orders without the court considering PDKV’s say.
 
  chairperson Roopa Rai charged PDKV with not making “honest efforts” to get rid of encroachments, unlike NU. “Many people from Kachipura and also from the commercial establishments approached me for water connections. But I’ve denied it, because PDKV had given us letters not to provide any amenities to encroachers.”
 
 She informed that NMC had issued eviction notice to the illegal structures in August 2015 as per the MRTP Act, but state urban development department granted a stay in January last year. “The only solution is to convene a joint meeting of government, NMC and encroachers, and settle out of court.”
 
 She pointed out that Kachis had been staying on the land since over a century, since the land was handed over to them by the British. “Now, where they will go? At least PDKV should compensate them with money or land, but it’s doing nothing. We could deny basic amenities to commercial operators like Saoji joints or Vishnuji Ki Rasoi or even   Service Centre, but not to the poor people. We can’t act against them directly, even though the land belongs to PDKV,” she said, adding that the PDKV should file a case in high court to demand eviction of commercial establishments.
 
 PDKV has been fighting a legal battle over last three to four decades against 22 encroachments in the names of 20 persons. Even a couple of religious structures have come up on its land. A majority of illegal structures exist from even before PDKV’s establishment. The university started issuing legal notices to them and filing civil suits for eviction in 1976, the RTI reply said. 
 
 Out of 26.78 hectares, 19.50 hectares is encroached by those hailing from Kachi community, basically engaged in farming since decades. Of late, many of them have subleased the land to commercial establishments, which have come up in big numbers on the ever busy road, including eateries, marriage lawns, garages, and other establishments.
