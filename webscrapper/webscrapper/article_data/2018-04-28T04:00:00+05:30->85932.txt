Surat: Stepping up its probe in the brutal rape and murder of the 11-year-old girl and her mother in Pandesara, the city police have picked up a man from Rajasthan for questioning.  The man, whose name was revealed by prime accused Harsayai Gurjar during preliminary questioning by Ahmedabad crime branch, is suspected to have sold the mother-daughter duo to him for Rs 35,000. Gurjar then brought them to Surat to work as bonded labourers in his marble fitting contracts business. However, Gurjar, a pervert sex maniac, raped the woman several times in his house and later murdered her in March. He had disposed of the body near Jiav-Budiya Road. Later, he also brutalized the girl and allegedly raped her, too, before killing her and dumping her body close to the same spot on April 5 night. The girl had 86 injury marks, including severe ones, in her private parts inflicted by inserting some solid wooden object. Police commissioner Satish Sharma told TOI that they are looking for at least two more persons who are involved in the crime, but are still absconding. One of them is Hari Om, who was with Gurjar when he had disposed of the bodies. The identity of the girl and her mother has also been established. They were natives of Rajasthan, Sharma said. On Friday evening, the last rites of the two were performed in the city. An official from the crime branch said the man was interrogated on Thursday and the questioning will continue on Saturday. However, he has not been officially arrested or detained.  While the girl’s body was found on April 6, her mother’s was found on April 9, around 1.5 km from the spot where the former was dumped.
