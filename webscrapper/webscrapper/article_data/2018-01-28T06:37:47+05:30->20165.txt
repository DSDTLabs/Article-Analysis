LUCKNOW: Days after   general secretary Sitaram   said that opposition parties should come together and consider moving an impeachment motion against the   Dipak Misra, Samajwadi Party MP   said he was not in favour of any such move. He said it was an internal matter of the judiciary and should be resolved by the judges.

 On Tuesday, Yechury had said that opposition parties had started discussions on the crisis triggered by four senior-most judges of the SC accusing CJI of judicial impropriety adding that they may even consider moving an impeachment motion against him. Terming the independence and integrity of the judiciary as non-negotiable, Yechury said the only option before the legislature was to tackle this through an impeachment motion. “I don’t support any such move. It is an internal matter of the judiciary and must be resolved by the judges themselves,” Agarwal said in a telephonic conversation with the TOI on Saturday.
 
 The senior leader, who is also a general secretary of the SP, said the four judges, too, had only brought the issue before the people and did not even talk of any move against the CJI, then why should the political parties take it on themselves to talk about impeachment.
 
 Most senior SP leaders whom TOI spoke to, also aired similar sentiments. “No party has approached SP with such a proposal till now. We will take a call once there is a formal move by the CPM,” said MLC and party spokesperson Udaiveer Singh.
