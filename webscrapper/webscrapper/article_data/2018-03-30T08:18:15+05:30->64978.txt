LUCKNOW: A day after BJP MP   spoke against the NDA government at Centre, claiming that reservation for backwards and dalits was under threat, another   from Mohanlalganj, Kaushal Kishore, said that the former was a classic case of a promising dalit politician falling into the trap of opposition which has been hatching a conspiracy to dislodge   from Prime Ministership.

 
 “Kuchh log vipaksha ke shadyantra ka shikaar ho jaate hain... (Some people fall prey to the conspiracy of the opposition,” Kishore told TOI, while reacting to Phule’s statement. “Everyone remembers PM Modi’s statement that he would never let reservation end... It cannot end. I had myself raised the issue in   thrice in the recent past. That there is a conspiracy to end reservation is nothing more than a rumour being spread by the opposition to gain political mileage against BJP,” he said.
 
 
 Phule, who began her political career with BSP, however, maintained that she was not being swayed by opposition and was only speaking what she felt. “I will continue with my ‘andolan’ (movement),” said Phule, who is holding ‘Bharatiya Samvidhan Bachao’ rally at Kanshiram Smriti Upvan, Lucknow, on April 1.
 
 
 This is the second instance of the   criticism from within after BJP suffered defeat in Gorakhpur and Phulpur byelections. Earlier, ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party had accused the state government of being corrupt and slammed it for failing to control law and order.
 
 
 On Thursday, sparks flew between BJP and SBSP yet again when BJP leader IP Singh termed Rajbhar a ‘blackmailer’ and a ‘cancer’ for NDA. Rajbhar, however, maintained that he would not get deterred by such remarks and would continue to raise issues of dalits and backwards. BJP spokesman Chandra Mohan Singh said that that was inner party democracy and every member had the right to speak.
