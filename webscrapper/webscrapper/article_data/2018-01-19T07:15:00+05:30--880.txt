Gurgaon: A group of around 40 workers of a private auto parts manufacturing company stood in   in front of the deputy labour commissioner R K Saini’s office at the Mini Secretariat complex in Gurgaon on Thursday morning.

 The workers of the SPM Autocomp Pvt Ltd protested after around 10 of them were suspended on various grounds days after they filed applications to form a union. 
 
 Ravinder Yadav, president of the worker’s association, told TOI that as many as 30 workers who had applied to for a union were transferred as soon as the company got a whiff of the application. “This is against rights of the workers,” said Monu, an advocate representing the workers.
 
 The workers also alleged the company of sending its goons to threaten them at their houses and on their way back from work, asking them to stop raising demands for formation of a union. They also said at least two accidents happen on the conveyor belt every week, leading to disabilities in workers. “The working conditions are pathetic. The safety sensors have been switched off for faster production,” a worker revealed on the condition of anonymity.
 
 After four hours, Saini met a group of protestors, where they raised safety concerns, apart from the issue of suspensions and transfers. “I have sought a report on the matter. It should hopefully be resolved by Saturday,” said Saini.
 
 The company’s management could not be reached for a response.
