Surat: The Khedut Samaj Gujarat (KSG) has opposed Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (SGCCI) proposed mega textile park at Pinjrat in Olpad taluka.  Farmer leaders on Thursday submitted a memorandum to SGCCI president B S Agarwal claiming that it would have ill effects on the environment, mangroves and disturb the inter-tidal zone. The KSG office-bearers claimed that the dyeing and printing mills in Pinjrat would cause immense pollution in the nearby villages and rendered large number of fishermen jobless.  KGS member Darshan Nayak told TOI: “SGCCI wants to set up industries on the land that falls under the inter-tidal zone. The land blocks owned by the government are part of Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ). If need be, we will move high court over the issue.” SGCCI has formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV) named Textile Processing Park Association (TPPA) to execute the project. The park will be developed 70 lakh sq m land owned with an investment of Rs 1,500 crore. The park will accommodate around 100 textile processing units, 40 water jet weaving units, around 225 garmenting units and other textile ancilliary units.  There would be giant textile processing units, each having an average manufacturing capacity of over three lakh meters fabric per day. Around 50 per cent of the fabric manufactured in the processing units will be converted into home textiles and garments. The remaining fabric will be sold outside the state. SGCCI president B S Agarwal said, “We have started the process environmental impact testing at the site and checking whether the land blocks are governed by the CRZ rules. We are fully aware of the environmental impact. The project will be set up only after passing all the required tests and permissions.”
