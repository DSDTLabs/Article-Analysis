Ahmedabad: Even as VHP’s international president, Togadia was traced to Chandramani Hospital in Shahibuagh on Monday evening, rumours spreading throughout the day reminded the victims of Naroda Gam of the large scale violence in 2002 post Godhra riots.

 Fear gripped the entire area with about 50 families, who had suffered in the 2002 post Godhra violence, leaving their houses to take shelter at different places in Gandhinagar, Ramol with their relatives. Sharif Malek, a witness to the 2002 riots, said that residents of the locality had approached Naroda police station to seek security, but they were informed that the security cover could be provided only after 11 pm. “They panicked and did not want to wait for the protection to come so late in the evening and shifted to other areas,” Malek said.
 
 It was not just the riot victims who had felt shaken after VHP supporters stopped vehicles at different places in the city but the rumours which started after that gripped the entire city.
 
 “We got calls from different places asking us whether there were riots in the city. Though they were just rumours we have deployed sufficient security in sensitive areas,” said a police official.
