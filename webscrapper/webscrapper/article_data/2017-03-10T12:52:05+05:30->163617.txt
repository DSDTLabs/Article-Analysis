CUTTACK: The three medical colleges - Burla's   (VIMSAR), MKCG Medical College, Berhampur and   and Hospital,   - have around 400 PG seats.

 Das, when contacted by TOI, said: "There is an allegation. The government has ordered a probe. Let the inquiry be complete before we jump into any conclusion." Das said there were specific complaints from students of a particular college. The government has asked the colleges to submit the report within seven days and take steps to ensure such things do not happen. 
 
 The government order comes after the director medical education and training (DMET), on March 4, wrote to the medical colleges regarding a complaint it had received from students where they alleged they were being used as domestic servants besides making them pay for the hospitality of external examiners. The DMET wrote to the colleges saying it would conduct periodic checks to avoid any such incident. A cross-section of PG students TOI spoke to said such a practice does exist. "They make , us do all sorts of things. They threaten to spoil our career unless we fall in line," said a student, pleading anonymity. 
 
 Sidharth Das, principal of SCB, said, "We will inquire if any such practice is prevalent anywhere," he said. Sonamali Bag, the director of VIMSAR, said: "The institute will conduct a thorough probe to find out the truth."
