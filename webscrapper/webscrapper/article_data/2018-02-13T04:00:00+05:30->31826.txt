Rajkot: A local court in Morbi on Monday convicted pro tem speaker and BJP MLA from Bhuj Nima Acharya, former Morbi MLA Kanti Amrutiya and former youth BJP president Manoj Panara for bribery as they had promised money to voters during 2009 Lok Sabha elections.

 Additional chief judicial magistrate J G Damodra convicted the trio under Section 171 B (bribery) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced them to one-year in prison with fine of Rs 1,000 each. However, the court stayed the execution of the order for 30 days on request of the advocate of the accused, who wanted to approach higher court, public prosecutor Rehana Gora said.
 
 Acharya, Amrutiya and Panara were accused of offering bribe money to lure voters during a public meeting held near Bhaktinagar Circle in Morbi on March 18, 2009. 
 
 According to complaint registered by then deputy election officer A J Patel under Section 171 B of IPC, Acharya, who was then MLA from Anjar, offered reward of Rs 5 lakh from the grant of Member of Parliament to those booth managers who got highest lead of votes. The booth manger with second highest score was promised a reward of Rs 2 lakh and one with third highest score was promised a reward of Rs 1 lakh. 
 
 The complaint further stated that the then sitting Morbi MLA Amrutiya had promised reward of Rs 1.51 lakh for the highest voting in favour of BJP candidate. This public meeting was organized by Panara, who was then BJP Morbi youth president. Panara is now Morbi convener for Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS). 
 
 Acharya won the assembly election held last year from Bhuj, while Amrutiya lost to his nearest Congress rival Brijesh Merja from Morbi seat. Morbi falls under the Kutch parliamentary constituency.
