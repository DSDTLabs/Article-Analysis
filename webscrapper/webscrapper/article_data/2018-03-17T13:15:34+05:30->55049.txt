TRICHY: Farmers in the district expressed distress as heavy rain accompanied by strong winds which lashed Trichy on Thursday afternoon, destroyed more than 15,000 banana plantains. 

 Farmers organisations stated that since only 10 to 20% of harvest was done, they would be incurring huge losses due to the recent rain and submitted a petition demanding monetary compensation at the collectorate on Friday.
 
 On Thursday, though it was only a short burst for about 15 minutes, the intensity was high and the district received above average rainfall of 1.7 mm.
 
 Horticulture department of Trichy conducted an inspection in the affected regions on Friday to estimate the extent of damage. According to deputy director of the district horticulture department  , at Allur village in  , out of 327 acres of planted area, 150 acres was damaged in the rain. “Most of the other regions were relatively less-affected. We have already started preparing the survey report along with the revenue department and we’ll soon send it to the government,” he told TOI. 
 
 “At a time when we are already worried since banana cultivation has been severely affected owing to the drought, the recent setback has inflicted even more pain for the farmers”, said state organiser of the farmers’ wing of TMC Puliyur A Nagarajan. “The most affected regions where the plantations were destroyed to a significant extent included Allur, Panayapuram and Manachanallur. On an average, Rs 3 lakh was spent for every acre and this recent rain is like a body blow for the farming community,” he claimed and added that the yield from the destroyed plantations would have fetched a profit of at least Rs 1 lakh per acre. 
 
 Representing TMC farmers, Nagarajan submitted a petition demanding at least Rs 1 lakh compensation per acre for the damages that were caused due to rain.
