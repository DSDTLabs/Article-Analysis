 Gaga has always maintained that Madonna was a huge influence on her   but after critics noticed similarities between ' ' and 'Express Yourself,' the 'Queen of Pop' dismissed the young star's music as 'reductive'. 
 
 Opening up about their feud, the singer, in her documentary 'Gaga: Five Foot Two', said it bothers her that Madonna would not look in her eyes and tell her what she felt about her. 
 
 "The thing with me and Madonna, for example, is that I admired her always and I still admire her no matter what she might think of me. No, I do. The only thing that really bothers me about her is that I'm Italian and from New York so, like, if I got a problem with somebody, I'm gonna tell you to your face. 
 
 "But no matter how much respect I have for her as a performer, I could never wrap my head around the fact that she wouldn't look me in the eye and tell me that I was reductive or whatever...," Gaga said.
