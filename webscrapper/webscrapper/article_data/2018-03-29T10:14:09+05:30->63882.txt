Citizen welfare society president S S   said: “The board collected a big amount from Sector 51 as maintenance charges for the parks but did nothing in five years to improve their state. Since the swings installed long time ago have broken off, the parks are of no use to children. Since there’s also hardly any tree or proper footpath inside, even the adults avoid going there.
