PUNE: A sessions court here has sentenced the   guard of a crematorium at Wadgaon Sheri to seven years rigorous   for raping an 18-year-old girl on the crematorium premises in April 2014.

 In a judgement on Wednesday, additional sessions judge Mohammad Nasir M Saleem found the accused, Dhananjay Namdeo Rokade (29), guilty of offences under Section 376 ( ) and 323 (assault) of the Indian Penal Code. 
 
 Apart from the main sentence, the court handed out a three-month prison term to the convict for the assault. The sentences are to run concurrently.
 
 According to the case put up by the prosecution, the survivor was a first-year bachelor of computer science student at a leading college in the city and lived with her father and brother in Wadgaon Sheri. Her father worked as a driver and her mother had passed away eight months prior to the rape incident.
 
 On April 6, 2014, the girl had visited the crematorium as she missed her mother. As she sat on the stairs of the crematorium, Rokade approached her and struck a conversation. Soon, he caught hold of her and dragged her to a nearby room, putting his hand on her mouth to prevent her from shouting and raped the girl.
 
 Later, when he stepped out to drink water, the girl ran away from the room and met some people outside the crematorium. She narrated her experience to the people, who apprehended and beat up Rokade. The girl rushed to a nearby house to seek help from a woman staying there and they reported the matter to the Yerawada police. 
 
 Rokade was tried for rape, assault, criminal intimidation and intentional insult. Public prosecutor Sunil Hande examined six witnesses, including the survivor, during the trial. The accused had taken a defence of consensual sex, but the court observed that there was no evidence to support his claim. On the contrary, the evidence provided by the witnesses and the medical evidence corroborated the prosecutionâ€™s case, the court added.
