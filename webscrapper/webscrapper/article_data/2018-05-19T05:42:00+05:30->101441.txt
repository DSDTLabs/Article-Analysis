Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) standing committee on Friday terminated work order issued to JK Solutions Inc for replacing sodium vapour street lights with LED street lights.

 As per a compromise formula, neither the civic body nor the private company will go for legal battle and claim liquidated damages and compensation. Standing committee chairman Virendra Kukreja and his members approved the termination proposal submitted by the electric department. The civic body will have to pay Rs 10.15 crore to the company for its services.
 
 As per NMC’s data, the private company was supposed to replace 26,712 street lights with LED street lights, strengthen infrastructure followed by operation and maintenance within 18 months from work order dated May 17, 2014. The company replaced only 565 street lights and executed some strengthening works. The NMC and the company blamed each other for project’s failure and claimed damages. NMC had engaged eight private companies in January 2016 to continue the work and it’s going on since then.
 
 The standing committee also approved the proposal to construct compound wall at Bhandewadi dumping yard at the cost of Rs 44.22 lakh. Proposal to continue ‘Janashree’ insurance and scholarship to NMC students was returned to the education department for revision.
 
 The committee has finalized nominal rate of Rs 300 and an advance of Rs 2,000 for renting dead body cold box. Former mayor Pravin Datke had sponsored two boxes from his corporator fund.
