NAGPUR: Ethanol-run   are nowhere to be seen on city roads even 33 days after the grand launch of the new system.

 Moreover, the city received a minor jolt with the state government giving first preference to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations in distribution of special buses for women under the Tejaswini Bus Scheme.
 
 The   (NMC) launched the nation’s first fleet of Green buses in the city at the hands of chief minister   and Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on December 6. The civic body had planned to run 10 of the 55 Green buses from December 7.
 
 Sources in NMC told TOI that Green buses will take more 15-20 days to begin operation. “Green bus operator  , the Swedish bus maker, bought seven buses and also registered with the RTO. The company is yet to develop ethanol fuel station totally at the allotted area at Khapri Octroi Post. Also, Scania is yet to finalize the private firm for operating and maintaining its buses. The deadline of January 26 has been given to Scania to begin operations,” sources said.
 
 The service began with new 15 semi-sized buses and 19 more buses were added to the existing fleet a couple of days ago taking the total to 34.
 
 The government had launched Tejaswini Bus Scheme under which five municipal corporations, including the NMC, were supposed to get 300 women special buses. The state urban development department headed by Fadnavis issued a notification on Monday giving permission to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations to procure buses. The government will bear total expense of the buses.
 
 However, there is no mention about approval to remaining municipal corporations, including the NMC.
