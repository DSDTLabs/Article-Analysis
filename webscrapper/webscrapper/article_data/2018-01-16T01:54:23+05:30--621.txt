Mumbai: The   and   finally laid to rest the plan for a   (FOB) near the now demolished   site. The   on Monday was informed that a FOB was not possibe and the new permanent   would be completed within 19 months. The first phase would be ready in 11 months.

 A division bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Nitin Sambre told the BMC and railways to place before the court on Wednesday the plans as well as a time-bound programme for the construction of the permanent bridge.
 
 The 136-year-old Hancock bridge, which linked Mazgaon with Sandhurst Road, was demolished in 2016. Activist Kamlakar Shenoy had filed a public interest litigation over the deaths of residents near Sandhurst Road station after the bridge was demolished. According to the petition, in order to avoid a 5-7km detour, locals were crossing the tracks to fetch water from a civic pipeline, resulting in accidents. The court had repeatedly urged the authorities to find a solution to prevent loss of lives till the new bridge was ready. The HC had also asked the BMC and railways to take the army’s expertise to construct a temporary foot over-bridge there. Last year, the army had placed two options before the court—either retro-fit the existing 168 ft-long and 9.6 inch-wide water pipeline across the railway tracks, so that people could use it, or build a temporary foot over-bridge.
 
 The railways said a temporary FOB was not feasible. The court was informed that the army had said that the temporary bridge was not possible unless landing space was provided. A plan submitted to the court detailed that a temporary FOB required land for entry and exit points, shut down of services during the work as well as constructing a bridge that is 6.52m from ground level to stay clear of electric and cable lines.
