HYDERABAD: While   has been ranked the second poorest performing state in the recent CMS-India Corruption Study 2018, a reply to a RTI query has revealed the apathy of various departments in the   when it comes to fighting corruption.

 
 Disregarding letters from the Telangana general administration department ( ) to prepare information regarding   cases for review by the chief secretary ( ), no department at the Secretariat furnished the required information.
 
 Retired IFS official Padmanabha   filed the RTI query. “I made a representation to the CS enclosing a list of cases booked by ACB and explained how accused officials involved in corruption cases were resorting to manipulation in the Secretariat and avoiding prosecution. I requested the CS to conduct an inquiry as to why ACB’s prosecution permissions have been rejected and to review procedures followed in dealing with the cases. In response, GAD addressed letters to all departments at Secretariat to prepare information in two statements, one for progress of clearance of ACB cases, the other to review progress of ACB cases where sanction is given,” Reddy said.
 
 “After six months, we filed another RTI to check the progress. But we got a reply from GAD saying no department had furnished information for review by CS...ACB cases, when referred to the government for permission to prosecute the tainted official, are kept pending for years. Finally, in many instances, the matter is sent for departmental inquiry which ultimately will be closed, instead of permission being given to prosecute the tainted official,” he said.
 
 Forum for Good Governance alleged serious lapses in Secretariat. It takes 2-15 years to clear ACB cases, it said. “All corruption cases must be concluded within three years,” Forum said.
