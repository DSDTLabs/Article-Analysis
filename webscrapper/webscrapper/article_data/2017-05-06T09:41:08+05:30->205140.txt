NEW DELHI: In a   that has gone viral, two   are seen arguing loudly with a   in a Metro coach in Delhi following what appears to be a  . One of the women is so incensed that, taking the men by surprise, she starts taking off her clothes - saying 'you want to fight, let's fight' - before a man intervenes to calm her down and defuse the situation. 

 It's not clear from the clip what the immediate provocation for the row was - whether the women were reacting to something that was said or one man in the crowd was protesting against being pushed around by them. However, once again, it becomes amply clear that most Delhi men do not extend the basic courtesies to women and do not walk away from what can only be an ugly confrontation with racial undertones.
 
 Even as the women protest, voices are heard in the background egging people on. " Bahar nikalo; maro in salon ko; bulaon police walon ko" is heard over the commotion. When one of the women takes off her top in protest, the man arguing with her turns away, embarrassed. 
 
  This is when another man steps in, saying, "Please calm down, nobody is trying to fight anybody". This restores sanity and the woman tells him, "Thank you, brother." One must thank this unidentified person for saving the city from an even bigger embarrassment, like the barbaric hounding of three African students on a Sunday evening in September 2014 at Rajiv Chowk Metro station on a mere rumour that they had harassed a woman. 
 
 A mob of a hundred surrounded a police booth where the three men had taken refuge, and there was no cop in sight for at least five minutes.
