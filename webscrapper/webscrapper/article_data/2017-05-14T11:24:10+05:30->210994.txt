NEW DELHI: A special court dealing with cases involving sexual assault on children has handed out 10 years of rigorous punishment to a 35-year-old man for allegedly threatening and sodomising a 12-year-old boy on multiple occasions.

 “The convict has been held guilty for committing   with a child who was having a relation of trust with him, which is an inhuman act by all means,” concluded special judge   of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court. 
 
 The court’s observation was based on the finding that the minor boy had been living with his mother and brother in the rented accommodation of the accused man,  , a tattoo artist for almost two decades.
 
 The minor narrated his ordeal of November 16, 2015. At around 6 pm that evening the man came to the victim’s house in an inebriated state. Jitender allegedly showed the victim porn clips on his cellphone, and followed it up by forcefully removing the boy’s clothes, sodomosing him while gagging his mouth.
 
 The accused had a different story to tell in his defense. He claimed that he was being falsely implicated in the case as the boy’s mother had borrowed money from him and was unable to pay him back. 
 
 In the court’s opinion, the victim did not have the protection of his father and his fear was understandable. It was only when the STD surfaced on the victim’s body and the doctor who examined him opined that he had undergone carnal intercourse, that he disclosed his ordeal.
