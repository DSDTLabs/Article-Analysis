MUMBAI: Mumbai can expect a generous funding for the   aimed at capacity expansion in the budget that will be presented before Parliament on Thursday. Funds will also be allocated for MUTP-IIIA with a rider that the amount be spent subject to all approvals.

 For 2016-17 budget, then railway minister Suresh Prabhu had made a token allocation of Rs 1 crore for MUTP III. The following year, Rs 411 crore was allocated for MUTP III project worth Rs 10,085 crore.
 
 A senior CR official said, “The minister will sanction Rs 49,524 crore-worth MUTP 3A, but funds will be meagre as approvals are still to be taken before the project can commence. But, it will be a significant development as it signals long-term planning to alleviate Mumbaikars’ travel woes.”
 
 MUTP 3A includes, redevelopment of 16 stations, procurement of 210 AC rakes, extension of harbour line up to Goregaon and laying of two extra lines beyond  .
 
 Another WR official said, “Some projects included in the MUTP 3A like Virar-Vasai-Panvel suburban corridor and CSMT-Panvel hi-speed corridor, have been on the drawing board for long. Incorporation of MUTP-IIIA is more for optics as the government wants to score points with voters as this is the last full budget before general elections in 2019.”
 
 A former MRVC official said, “Funds are not a constraint, but the problem is to execute challenging projects on the ground.”
 
 There is been almost zero progress in laying of additional tracks between   and Kurla and bare minimum for the sixth line between Mumbai Central and Borivli. The project deadline has now been pushed to 2022.
 
 General secretary of Mumbai Rail Pravasi Sangh, Kailash Verma, said, “Mumbaikars are bored of announcements. They now wish to see progress on the ground.”
