COIMBATORE: A group of job seekers from western and southern districts petitioned the city crime branch police on Monday, seeking action against a   and its owners for allegedly duping them to the tune of Rs 64 lakh by promising to get jobs in Singapore. 

 R Sathish, 24, of Tirupur, said he saw an advertisement in a local channel by owners of the agency from   in Coimbatore inviting job seekers to apply for jobs in abroad. A BCA graduate, Satihish believed the advertisement and approached the owners of the agency over mobile phone. He was asked to visit the office of the agency in person, where they asked him to pay Rs 1.03 lakh. "I was told that the agency had already got a job for me in Singapore and I would get salary of Rs 1 lakh per month. The agency told me that they would provide VISA on January 16 and flight ticket on January 19. I believed their words and paid the whole amount in October 2016. I tried to contact the owners of the agency on last week of December but their mobile phones were switched off. Immediately, I visited their office and found that it was closed. The owners managed to escape," said Sathish said.
 
 S Janardhanan, of   in Erode district, had completed BE and had given Rs 1 lakh to the agency. "The firm had cheated more than 30 job seekers from Salem, Madurai, Theni, Tirupur, Erode and Coimbatore districts. The firm owners are absconding and their whereabouts are also not known," said Janardhanan. The city crime branch police officials received petition from the victims and told them that they would conduct a detailed inquiry and would take appropriate action.
