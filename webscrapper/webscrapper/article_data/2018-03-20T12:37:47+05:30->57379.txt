NAGPUR: Lakadganj   on Monday arrested   for allegedly kidnapping four-year-old   Sarwane last week. He had fled after abandoning Shraddha at GMCH.

 Mendurkar, a resident of Kharbi, claimed to have kidnapped Shraddha under the influence of alcohol, but the investigating team, under Senior PI Santosh Khandekar and Zonal DCP  , does not believe this is the truth. Mendurkar, father of a five-year-old son, is a barber by profession, and owns a small temporary set-up on a footpath. He has denied abducting four-year-old Harshal Gosavi from Gayatri Nagar a day before Shraddha’s kidnapping.
 
 Khandekar said detection wing in-charge sub-inspector   and his team had kept a watch on the Hasanbagh-Kharbi stretch for last two days as CCTV footage had suggested the kidnapper had returned to that locality.
 
 “Mendurkar was spotted by a Lakadganj team on foot. His gait and physical features matched the person seen in the footage. He was immediately rounded up and brought to Lakadganj police station,” he said.
