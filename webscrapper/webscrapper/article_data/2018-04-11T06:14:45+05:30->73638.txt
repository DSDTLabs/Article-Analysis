AHMEDABAD: Chaos coursed through the compound of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s Danapith office till late evening on Tuesday, as fire volunteers and the relatives of a deceased fire volunteer,   (36), refused to cremate his body unless their demands were met. They sought compensation and a job for Parmar’s relative. They said that Parmar had died while on duty.

 “Parmar was a volunteer with us and had complained of dizziness and collapsed on Tuesday morning,” said M F Dastur, chief fire officer,  . “Other volunteers took him to hospital. He could not be revived and succumbed to a heart attack.”
 
 Sources said that as the fire volunteers tried to bring Parmar’s body to the AMC’s compound, the gates were closed. The body was kept in a van till late evening. Municipal commissioner   said: “A group of fire volunteers along with Parmar’s brother have made a representation. We will consider the case. So far, no decision has been taken.”
 
 This is a second such death in the past four days. On Saturday, similar demands were made to the AMC by union leaders and family members of a worker in Lambha ward of the south zone,  , who had also died of a heart attack while on duty. His body remained in the AMC compound till late night on Saturday.
