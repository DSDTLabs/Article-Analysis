Villupuram: Pattali Makkal Katchi ( ) will hold a   conference on September 17 to mark the 30th anniversary of the massive protest, which succeeded to get reservation for backward classes in 1987. As many as 21 people were killed in police firing during the protest.

 PMK founder-leader S  , in a party release, said the conference acquires major significance as the recent developments including the introduction of National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) have posed a threat to social justice.
 
 Regretting that just five students from government schools have joined MBBS in the academic year 2017-18, he said three of them got seats in private medical colleges and hospitals under government quota. “It is a social injustice caused by the introduction of NEET,” he said.
 
 He said the recent developments were not only a threat to social justice, but also to policies of creating equal opportunities for marginalised people in government employment and protecting violation of human rights. He recalled that the party launched a series of protests in 2007 and succeeded in abolishing the entrance examinations for admitting students in medical courses. 
 
 “However, the Union government has imposed NEET, dashing the dreams of state board students. Only the students of the central board with intensive and special coaching will be in a position to join medical programmes,” he said.
 
 Ramadoss will honour the family members of the 21 people, who were killed in police firing during the protest three decades ago.
