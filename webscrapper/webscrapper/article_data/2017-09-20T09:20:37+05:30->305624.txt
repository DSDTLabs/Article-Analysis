VADODARA: Work on the 380km-long Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway will begin next month, Union minister of road transport and highways   announced here on Tuesday. The six-lane highway is expected to cut down travel time by road between Ahmedabad and Mumbai considerably.

 Gadkari, who was in Vadodara to attend the 38th meeting of the   and state transport ministers, said the project would cost Rs 44,000 crore.
 
 “The expressway will be axis-controlled. Land acquisition for the project is already completed. We will start the work on it next month,“ he said. Gadkari said commuters from Vadodara will be able to reach Mumbai in two-and-a-half to three hours once the highway is operational and up to Ahmedabad in six hours.
 
 “We have already issued five tenders to begin the work on this expressway,“ he said.
 
 The Union ministry of forest and environment had granted final clearance to the expressway project. Later, land acquisition for the 380km project which was facing hurdles from land owners of Gujarat and Maharashtra had started. Officials of the   suggested that the expressway starts from   near Creek Bridge in   and traverses through the districts of Silvasa, Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bharuch and Vadodara. It will ultimately connect to the already existing Ahmedabad-Vadodara expressway.
 
 “Once commissioned, a person heading to Mumbai will be able to drive down to Mumbai from Ahmedabad in around six hours, the same time as taken by Shatabdi train,“ said a senior official. The project had got delayed due to opposition of land owners in Gujarat especially those in Navsari and Valsad districts and also those in   and Thane districts of Maharashtra.
 
 Earlier, due to problems in land acquisition, NHAI was not in a position to decide on the time for starting the project.
