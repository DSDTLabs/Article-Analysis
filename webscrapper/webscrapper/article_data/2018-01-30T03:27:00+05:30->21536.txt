Panaji: Sleuths of directorate of vigilance’s anti corruption branch (ACB), who visited Mumbai to trace the companies that had given several crores worth of loans to leader of opposition Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar, found that the entities did not exist.  The ACB has speeded its investigation in the Rs 4.78 crore disproportionate assets case against Kavlekar. ACB superintendent of police (SP) Priyanka Kashyap told TOI, “No such entities were found to be existing at the address given by Kavlekar and we are in the process of carrying out further verifications.” The directorate of vigilance granted ACB permission to send a team outside the state to investigate into the companies that had given loans to the tune of crores of rupees to Kavlekar. Kavlekar had told the ACB that he had got about Rs 5.5 crore through unsecured loans from these companies, ACB sources said, adding that the loans were interest free. On September 15, 2017, ACB registered a first information report (FIR) in the disproportionate assets case under Section 13 (2) read with 13 (1) (e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  ACB had also booked Kavlekar’s wife Savitri in the case under Section 109 (abetment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as she is a director of Kavlekar’s companies.  ACB had conducted searches at Kavlekar’s residence at Quepem as well as his office and commercial offices at Quepem and Margao, respectively. In 2013, ACB had received information that Kavlekar, then chairman of Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), had acquired various properties in Kerala.  Accordingly, ACB started preliminary investigations and conducted a verification drive into his entire tenure, from the time he was elected as MLA, till 2013. ACB found that Kavlekar served as GIDC chairman for six-and-a-half years. It was also revealed that he purchased around 14 different properties worth crores of rupees in Kerala.
