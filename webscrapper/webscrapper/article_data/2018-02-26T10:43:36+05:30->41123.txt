TRICHY: Service Doctors and Post-Graduates Association (SDPGA) demanded to reinstate the 50 % quota for the service doctors in post graduate admissions in  , here on Sunday. It was one of the five resolutions adopted by them in the 10th state executive committee of the association in Trichy.

 The reservation of 50% for in-service candidates in the admission for the post-graduate medicine courses in the government colleges should be given as in the case of previous years, for which an amendment should be brought in the rule 9 of   (MCI) Act, said one of the resolutions passed in the meeting chaired by its state president Dr A Lakshmi Narayanan and attended by doctors from several districts.
 
 “We vehemently oppose NEET for both under graduate and post graduate admissions. The previous system of providing 50 % reservation to service doctors helped several doctors serving in rural areas to get into post graduate courses. If the system is abolished, it will be detrimental to the health sector in Tamil Nadu,” said join secretary of the association   in Chennai.
 
 The issue over abolishing reservation for in-service candidates in post graduate admission had sparked widespread protests among doctors across the state in April this year. The doctors associations had even boycotted treatment in several districts. SDPGA also resolved to meet the PM   to represent their demand strongly.
 
 The association also expressed its solidarity with the on-going protest by government employees and teachers to revive the old pension scheme and the arrears of the 7th pay commission. Stating the difference in the pay between the state and central government doctors, the association also insisted on implementing the Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DACP) scheme.
 
 SDPGA also plans to form a joint action committee to take up the issue and has decided to protests from March 1.
