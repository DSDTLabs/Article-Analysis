Surat: The high recovery in the US and European jewellery sectors has provided an opportunity to the Indian gems and jewellery industry, especially the diamantaires in Surat, to expect good export orders in 2018. 

 The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has predicted a double-digit growth for India’s gems and jewellery export in 2018-19. The council is planning to step up promotion in markets that lagged in recent years, including Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America. 
 
 “India’s gem and jewellery exports will grow by a double-digit percentage this year,” GJEPC chairman Pramod Agrawal said.
 
 The high quality of Indian manufacturing and a recovery in US and European markets will drive the growth, Agrawal explained at the India International Jewellery Show (IIJS) in Mumbai. The GJEPC is planning to step up promotion in markets that lagged in recent years, including in Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America, he added. 
 
 Turning to the local diamond trade, Agrawal said the GJEPC was lobbying the government to retract its decision to raise the import duty on polished diamonds from 2.5% to 5%. The new duty creates an uneven playing field that will hamper the nation’s competitiveness with Belgium, Dubai and Israel, he has argued.
 
 “We have asked the government to roll back the increase of the import duty,” Agarwal said. “We welcome the January decision to cut the goods and services tax (GST) on polished diamonds to 0.25% from 3% as it will encourage trading in diamonds in the domestic market,” he added.
 
 Regional chairman of GJEPC Dinesh Navadiya said, “The diamond manufacturers in Surat are optimistic on the recovery in the US and European markets. The manufacturing of diamonds has been ramped up following the increase in overseas orders. We expect that the exports of polished diamonds is going to increase this year.”
