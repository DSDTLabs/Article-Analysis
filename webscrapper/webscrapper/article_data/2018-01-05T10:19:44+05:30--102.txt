Mediaone TV’s popular cookery show ‘Treat,’ hosted by Chef Sumaija and  , will have a unique episode this week.

 In the recently released trailer of the episode, we see the hosts visiting a few hotels that serve vegetarian food, in the season of pilgrimage. “I am tired of eating chicken. It’s a ‘relaxation’ that we are having vegetarian for this episode,” says Sumaija, as she sets out on the tasting mission for the programme. However, as opposed to the expectation, we see that the episode is not all about the traditional dishes. The trailer features a cake-like dish that is served with chopped leaves garnished on the top, with an interesting comment from Raj Kalesh that triggers curiosity about its taste.
 
 The episode will be aired at 10.30 pm on January 5, on Mediaone.
