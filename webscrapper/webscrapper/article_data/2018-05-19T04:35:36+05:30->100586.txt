NEW DELHI: A gang of car robbers who travel in a Hyundai Creta SUV and snatch high-end luxury vehicles at gunpoint are on the scanner of cops. Their latest victim was a south Delhi-based interior designer. The gang fled with his   SUV by holding the driver at gunpoint outside a mall at Vasant Kunj on Thursday.

 
 The driver, Ashok Rai, was driven around Mahipalpur for nearly an hour and then dropped near   flyover. A gang from Jhajjar is suspected to be involved in similar cases at Dwarka, Delhi Cantt and Gurgaon.
 
 Rai drove his employer, Vikram Sharma, to the mall for a business meeting around 4.30pm. “I parked the car near the mall, but was asked to take a U-turn by some cops challaning vehicles. I took the turn and parked the vehicle in the corner,” he said.
 
 After sometime, three men in a Hyundai Creta parked their vehicle in front of the Fortuner. They then drove ahead, returned and stopped their SUV behind Rai’s. “I had stepped out to stretch my legs when three men came and pushed me on the rear seat,” said Rai.
 
 The driver was pinned to the floor with two robbers sitting on his chest. The men started talking among themselves whether to shoot him or   him somewhere. “I pleaded for mercy saying that I have a family and they decided to let me go. They asked me to take an autorickshaw and go home. They also snatched my phone and money,” Rai added.
 
 The men slowed down near RTR flyover and pushed Rai out. “I borrowed a phone from a youth and informed my employer about the carjacking,” the driver said.
 
 An FIR for robbery and illegal confinement has been registered at Vasant Kunj police station. 
 
 Police are preparing a sketch based on the description given by Rai. The men spoke in a Haryanvi accent. Police teams are looking for the robbers in villages around Manesar and Bahadurgarh.
