THANE: Investigators probing the   case involving former actress   have found that the accused used to impersonate as police officials or Income Tax (IT) department and threaten victims. The modus operandi of the gang was to trap cash-strapped businessmen and offer to facilitate multi-core loans in return for a 1% commission. While the funds would never be made available to the businessman, the gang would pocket the commission amount in advance.

 The city police busted the racket with the arrest of four persons, including a history-sheeter Paromita Chakraborty and Susairaj.
 
 “New details have emerged in the case in which some members of the gang used to pose as police officers and at times as Income Tax officers. They would demand 1% commission that they had paid for the loan,’’ a police officer said.
