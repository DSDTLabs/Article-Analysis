NEW DELHI: Tennis ace   and his estranged partner  , who have been fighting a legal battle for three years over their matrimonial dispute, were asked by the   on Friday to resolve the issue amicably and try for an out of court settlement.

 After a brief hearing, a bench of Justices   and Amitava Roy asked the couple to sit together and try to explore ways to settle their dispute amicably.
 
 “It would be better if you work out and settle the dispute amicably. You can settle either way,” the court said. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi and lawyer Gaurang Kanth, appearing for Peas, agreed to give a try for out of court settlement.
