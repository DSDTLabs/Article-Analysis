PANAJI: A 20-year-old youth who was on a   from Kerala to Uttar Pradesh has been admitted to the state-run Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, on Monday as he showed symptoms similar to those afflicted by the   virus.

 Suman Khan has been kept in an isolation ward at GMC after he was referred there by the district hospital in Mapusa where he was taken from Tivim railway station. 
 
 GMC medical superintendent Dr S M Bandekar said Khan is being treated for “viral encephalitis which has symptoms overlapping with the Nipah virus”. “He was in a disoriented state and running high  ,” said Bandekar. “His blood samples have been sent to a Pune laboratory for testing.” The results are likely by Tuesday evening.
 
 Bandekar said Khan was taken to the district hospital as he fell ill while the train was transiting through Goa. 
 
 The hospital staff has not been able to elicit much information from Khan, or even confirm whether he had come in contact with any person with the Nipah virus while in Kerala, given his condition, the doctor said.
 
 “Since he was travelling alone, we have contacted the police to trace his family,” said Bandekar. 
 
 State epidemiologist and nodal officer Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said, “There is no need to panic. Our surveillance has started.” All hospitals including private ones have been instructed to be alert for any suspected case of Nipah. The dos and don’ts have been specified, he said.
 
 He said besides making arrangements for sending blood samples for testing to a laboratory in Pune, if the need arises, the samples can also be sent to Manipal laboratory in Karnataka.
