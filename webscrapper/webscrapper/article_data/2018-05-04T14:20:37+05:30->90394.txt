Panaji: The five-member committee appointed by the town and country planning ministry to look into implementation of the Regional Plan 2021 and the allegations leveled by  , held its first meeting on Thursday and decided to issue a notice to Goencho Awaz seeking details of all illegal conversions of land.

 “Notice to be issued to the conveners and other speakers of the meeting held at   for giving specific details on the allegations made,” chief town planner Rajesh   said.
 
 Last Friday, at a public meeting organised by Goencho Avaaz, activists named more than a dozen politicians, including town and country planning minister  , accusing them of illegally trying to convert zoning of land for commercial gains.
 
 Goencho Avaaz has been asked to submit allegations in writing regarding illegalities by politicians, individuals and institutions on the issue of conversion or change in zones through the regional plan.
 
 “Allegations require to be substantiated by necessary documentary evidence and supporting documents for scrutiny and study by the committee,” Naik said.
 
 The committee has sought the information by May 11, but does not spell out the future course of action if the members of Goencho Awaz do not respond to the notice.
 
  Once Goencho Avaaz submits the details, the committee will conduct the necessary study into the allegations and take “appropriate decision” on a case to case basis and then submit a report to the government for “necessary action”, the committee has said.
