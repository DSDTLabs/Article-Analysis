One Direction star Liam   says he and partner   won't be spoiling their son   because they want him to understand the importance of hard work. The 'Strip That Down' singer and Cheryl have an estimated personal fortune of over 70 million pounds.

  
  
 "We are very lucky and we will raise him to know we've worked hard to have these nice things," Payne says. The singer loves seeing how his son is changing every day and thinks being a father is "incredible". 
 
 "I discover him every day and I see his eyes brighten when I talk to him. He always looks at me with great attention and he often tries to imitate me by moving his mouth."
 
 "I'm happy to be a dad, it's an incredible thing. I give my son as much love as I have received from my parents."
