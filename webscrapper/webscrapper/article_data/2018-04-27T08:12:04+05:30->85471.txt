AMRITSAR: Pakistan's   (ETPB), the governing body of the   Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC), could recommend imposing a ban on non-Sikh pilgrims traveling to Pakistan along with Sikh jathas. Often Hindus visit to Pakistan along with Sikh jatha to pay obeisance in Pakistan gurdwaras. 

 Intelligence sources here told TOI that following violation of visa rules by Garhshankar resident in Hoshiarpur district Kiran Bala and resident of Niranjanpur in Amritsar district Amarjit Singh, the ETPB could take the decision of imposing a ban on visit of non-Sikhs. "We have reports that ETPB official held a meeting to contemplate over it and could soon make formal announcement," said sources.
 
 Reacting to the development,   ( ) president Gobind Singh Longowal said, "Yes, only those people should accompany a jatha who have faith in Sikhism." He added that they could also take a similar decision.
 
 When asked that a lot of Hindu's who also accompany Sikh jatha to pay obeisance at gurdwaras in Pakistan would be disheartened with such a decision, he said SGPC had constituted a committee that would contemplate over these issues and submit its report.
 
 Meanwhile Sehajdhari Sikh Party chief Paramjit Singh Ranu condemned the possible move by ETPB. "It is a great injustice with 85% of the Sikh community, especially the Nanak Naam Leva Sikhs," he said.
 
 He also appealed to the Pakistan authorities to think twice before making any decision. "The possible action could be biased and a hasty decision taken purely with non-application of mind will hurt the religious emotions of the minority," said Ranu. He said that majority of Sikhs living in Pakistan were Sehajdharis, especially the Nanak Panthi Sindhis, who believed in Sikhism.
 
 ETPB's deputy secretary for shrines Imran Gondhal told that they were contemplating the issue and had called an emergency meeting for the purpose.
