MUMBAI: Parents of kids studying at a   school have once again raised concerns over the structural safety of the institute's building. The   has issued a show-cause notice to the school over alleged illegal changes made to the structure. 

 On January 10, vibrations were felt at   for a few seconds during working hours. The following day, parents received an email from the school, informing them that the institute will be shut for a structural audit. "Following the uproar, the school authorities met us and said the building was safe. They also assured that all work done on campus is legal," said a parent from the pre-primary section.
 
 The BMC on February 1 issued a notice for unauthorized extensions on the sixth floor; illegal cabins, toilets and wooden partition on the mandatory open space; and sheds fixed with pipes and fibre sheets. 
 
 "If everything was in order, why has the BMC sent a notices? We had also asked the school to uninstal the mobile towers on the building but that hasn't been done yet," said another parent. 
 
 School authorities, however, said the notices were responded with documentary evidence. "It is a false complaint with no merit. There is no illegality involved," said  , trustee of the school. BMC officials said no further action has been taken.
