BHUBANESWAR: Birthday of political parties have always been a no show. Even many senior BJP leaders did not know when their party was born in the state till the saffron dispensation decided to observe the day on Thursday in all districts and in style. 

 Senior BJP functionaries here admitted that the birthday bash is a build-up to party's much-hyped two-day national executive scheduled from April 15, to be attended by among others Prime Minister Narendra Modi, L K Advani, BJP president Amit Shah and chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, including Up chief minister Yogi Adityanath.
 
 The 38th foundation day of BJP hence has a long agenda. In the morning, party's state president   accompanied by others will preside over a ground breaking ceremony at Janata Maidan, the venue for the national executive. 
 
 Away in the districts, booth-level meetings have been planned at 36,000 places, while newly-elected zilla parishad members, panchayat functionaries and other local leaders will fan out to meet families in villages and tell them about BJP's pro-people performance and the need to bring the party to power in the state. Party flag hoisting ceremony in the beginning will set the tone for the booth-level meetings, party sources here said.
 
 "We have chalked out plans to take our campaign to even the most inaccessible areas of the state to make people aware of the BJD governments failure," said state president Panda.
