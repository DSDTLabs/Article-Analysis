MUMBAI:   murder accused   was admitted to state-run   in   at around 11.30 pm on Friday. 

 
 “Mukerjea was admitted in the critical care unit at 11.30 pm for chest pain evaluation,” said JJ Hospital's medical superintendent Dr  , early on Saturday. She is under care of senior professor Dr Waqar Shaikh.
 
 Medical superintendent Dr   said, "Clinical evaluation and investigations are going on. She is stable."
 
 Incidentally, this is the second time in two months that Mukerjea has been admitted to hospital.
 
 In April, she was rushed to JJ Hospital from Byculla Jail with suspected overdose of medicines. Subsequent tests showed she had taken an overdose of pills. She has since petitioned the court saying she is worried for her life; she alleged that there is a threat to life in prison and someone is trying to poison her. 
 
 In October 2015 as well, Mukerjea was taken to the JJ Hospital in an unconscious state due to suspected drug overdose.
 
 Indrani has been in jail for the last three years for the murder of her daughter Sheena Bora (24). It is alleged she killed Bora in April 2012. The CBI, which took over the case in November 2015, claimed that a financial dispute was the reason for Bora's killing.
