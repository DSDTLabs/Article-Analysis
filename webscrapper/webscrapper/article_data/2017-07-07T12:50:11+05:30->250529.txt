Ayal Sasi, starring   in the lead, explores the life of a commoner named Sasi, his dilemmas and eccentricities. The soundtrack has two folksy, fun-to-listen-to songs that have some ‘conventionally unconventional’ musical terrain.
  by Vineeth Sreenivasan, the first song, sums up the theme of the movie with a sketch of the character of Sasi. It has some salt of the earth music that is also fun and catchy enough. An adorable tune presented melodiously by   with the support of some energetic chorus, Sasipattu is a great listen.
 Akkana Thikkana by Sreenivasan senior is a tune-less composition riding on a slow rhythm and Sreenivasan’s peculiar vocal presentation. It’s an out-and-out folk number with some interesting, competition-like chorus.
