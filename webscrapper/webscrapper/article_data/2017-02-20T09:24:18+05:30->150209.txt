GUWAHATI: Students of IIT-Guwahati (IIT-G) have launched a mission to educate schoolchildren in rural areas and make them conversant with modern technology. The mission, called Pragati, is being helmed by members of the team in charge of Techniche, the institute's annual techno-management fest to be held in September.

Students of the elementary classes are being taught the fundamentals while those studying in higher classes are being given career guidance.
