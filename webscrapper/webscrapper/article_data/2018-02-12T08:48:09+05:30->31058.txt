RAJKOT: President of Bharat Sadhu Samaj   on Friday urged chief minister   not to visit   on Mahashivratri day to avoid chaos and unwanted problems for the pilgrims. He said CM may visit the Mahashivratri fair a day before it. 

 Talking to media persons,   said, “If CM visits the fair, special arrangement is required for the security reasons. It becomes difficult for the police to manage the pilgrims. In 2012, seven people lost their lives in a stampede during Mahashivratri fair. 
 
 So we request the CM to avoid to visiting on that day.” Gopalanand Maharaj resides at an ashram in Bilkha, about 20 km from Junagadh town.
