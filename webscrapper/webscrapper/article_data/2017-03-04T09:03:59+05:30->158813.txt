VADODARA: A penchant for dressing up as a cop has landed a 33-year-old in police custody!

 The   (SOG) on Friday arrested  , a resident of New VIP Road, who was roamong around in a duplicate police uniform and even had an identity card. Nainwani used to move around in the city and tell everyone that he is a cop. An air gun too was seized from him along with his motorbike.
 
 “He always wanted to be identified as a cop just to show-off . So he brought a duplicate   police uniform from a fancy dress shop and began wearing it. He also kept a stick apart from a fake police identity card,” H M Vyas, SOG police inspector said. 
 
 When asked whether Nainwani extorted money from people by posing as a cop, Vyas said that his prima facie questioning doesn’t suggest any such thing.
 
 SOG constable Hemrajsinh Raulji received information about Nainwani following which they nabbed him near the airport. “He works as a private guard in two different security firms. We have recovered two identity cards of those firms from him,” Vyas added. 
 
 In fact, Nainwani’s wife too thought that he was working in the police department! 
 
  “He got married last month. He told his wife that he works in the police,” Vyas said. He has been handed over to Harni police that will seek his remand on Saturday.
