 The dam has 98 gates with a flush out capacity of around 15 lakh cusec water from the reservoir. The additional spillway will increase the dam's water discharge capacity to 24 lakh cusec. Considering the meteorological and climate changes and probable maximum flood, the   (CWC) has recommended augmenting the dam's water discharge capacity, which will also provide safety to the 60-year-old multi-purpose dam.
 
 Chief Engineer of the Hirakud Dam Project,   said, around 359 acres of land would be needed for the construction of the proposed spillway channel. Of the total land, around 200 acres belong to the Water Resources Department. Around 750 families are residing on the government land, preliminary assessment shows. The SIA study also aims at finding solution for the resettlement of the encroachers.
 
 The 300-metre width and 1800-metre long spillway channel is proposed to originate from near the Gandhi Minar on the left dyke of Hirakud reservoir and meet the river near  . Around Rs 390 crore, likely to be sourced from the World Bank, will be spent on the spillway project.
 
 The chief engineer said the construction work, tender for which is to be floated soon, is scheduled to be over in 13 months. In April 2015, a 12-member team from the World Bank, Central Water Commission and the Dam Safety department had visited the Hirakud dam site to study the additional spillway plan.
