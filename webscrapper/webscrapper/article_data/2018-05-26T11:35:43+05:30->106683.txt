AMRITSAR: Reacting to chief minister Amarinder Singh’s warning to the Sikh seminary   against issuing death threats to preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, its chief   on Friday blamed the CM for allegedly creating religious unrest by encouraging anti-panthic elements.

 In a press release issued here on Friday, Dhumma alleged that the CM had given an irresponsible statement that was bereft of facts. “Damdami Taksal never frightened anyone, nor it is afraid of anyone. It is ready to take on any challenge,” he said.
 
 A video of Damdami Taksal spokesperson   had gone viral on the social media in which he had allegedly issued death threats to Dhadrianwale.
 
 Taksal chief alleged that by encouraging controversial Sikh preachers, Amarinder was trying to create unrest in the Panthic affairs. He said being a Sikh, the CM should understand the sentiments of the community. “Instead of focusing his attention on the controversial Sikh preachers, Amarinder is targeting Damdami Taksal,” stated Dhumma.
