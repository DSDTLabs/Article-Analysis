INDORE: A 25-year-old woman committed suicide after strangulating her four-year-old daughter in Rau on Wednesday evening.

 The incident came to light when the woman’s husband Sehdev Rawat reached home on Wednesday evening and found the house locked from inside.
 
 He called his friend Vijay Bhura and other neighbours and broke open the door of the house. He found his wife Nirmala Rawat hanging from the ceiling fan in the kitchen with his daughter Anshika’s body tied to her.
 
 Locals and family members immediately informed Rau police about the matter who reached the spot with forensics experts. Rau police said prima facie it seemed that the woman had killed her daughter by strangulating her, tied her body to her torso and then hanged herself from the ceiling fan.
 
  “While speaking to police, Sehdev claimed that his wife had been suffering from some illness since past few months and had been undergoing treatment for the same. She was depressed following which she might have committed the crime,” Sisodiya added.
 
 He further added that they were yet to properly interrogate Sehdev in the matter.
 
 “I received a call from Sehdev at 6:45 pm and he said that the door of his house was locked from inside and Nirmala and Anshika were not responding. We called the neighbours and broke open the door,” said Vijay Bhura, Sehdev’s friend who lodged a complaint at Rau police station.
 
 Police said both the bodies were handed over to the family members after postmortem examination. “The exact cause of the death of the minor will be cleared only after autopsy report comes in. No suicide note was found from the spot,” said Sisodiya.
