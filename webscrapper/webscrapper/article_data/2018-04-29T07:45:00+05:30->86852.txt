Shimla: Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday said law and order situation in the state was completely out of order during the previous Congress regime and drug mafia, mining mafia and transfer mafia had a free run. He said soon after assuming the office, the present government had launched Gudiya Helpline and Shakti Help Button for ensuring safety of women and Hoshiyar Singh Helpline for checking various activities like illegal mining and drug peddling.

 While addressing a public meeting at Mela Ground Hat (Bajaura) in Kullu district, he said since assuming the office not even a single day had passed when the government had not taken decisions or initiatives for the welfare of the people. He added that the Central leadership had full faith in the present state government and, thus, it was the duty of the government to come upto its expectations. 
 
 The CM said the government was working with a set target. “Welfare of women, youth, poor, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes is the priority of government and several welfare schemes have been announced in the budget for these sections,” he added. 
 
 Thakur said Mukhiya Mantri Lok Bhawans would be constructed in all assembly constituencies of the state and a provision of Rs 30 lakh has been made for this in each constituency. He added that steps had also been taken to protect abandoned cattle. 
 
 Transport and forest minister Govind Singh Thakur said a ropeway between Pandoh to Baglamukhi Mata temple would be constructed soon. He ádded that this would give a big boost to the tourism activities in the area.
 
 Mandi BJP MP Ram Swaroop Sharma said Rs 50 crore had been earmarked for the Bhanupalli-Bilaspur-Manali-Leh Rail line.
