 surprised her grandmother   by turning up on the set of the latter’s film Dhadha 87. The film has veteran   playing the central role of a don and Saroja plays his pair. Saroja, who is Keerthy’s maternal grandmother,  , had previously acted alongside her granddaughter in a small role in Remo.

 The film’s director Vijay Sri G tells us, “We were shooting for a song featuring Saroja ma’am and Charuhasan sir recently. She had apparently told Keerthy about working on this film at home, and Keerthy decided to drop in on the set. She was there for three to four hours and saw her grandmother shoot her scenes. She was there till Saroja ma’am’s portions were over and left after getting Charuhasan sir’s blessings.”
