PANAJI: The finding of four,   along the beach stretch between Mobor, Cavelossim and Zalor, Carmona has baffled   and others, as no injury marks could be seen on the carcasses.

 No cases of   have been reported along other stretches of Goa’s coastline. “We found four carcasses between Mobor and Zalor on Monday,” a   official said.
 
 No flipper of any of the turtles appeared missing nor any injuries could be noticed. But the turtles were in a decomposed condition and only one was taken for postmortem. “We are trying to ascertain the cause of death,” the source said.
 
 The department was informed by a lifeguard of Drishti lifesaving. But a long-time resident of Mobor, who requested anonymity, saw a dead turtle near the Indian  . He saw a few more as he walked towards the northern end of the beach.
 
 “This is like a massive slaughter, though it may not be intentional. The matter needs to be investigated if it is due to trawler activity,” he said.
 
 The forest department officials said that the flippered visitors may have died three to four days ago. There may be more carcasses on isolated stretches. “We cannot make out the cause of mortality, but are hoping the postmortem will provide some clue,” an official said. Injuries to turtles and other marine species have been increasing in recent years. A few years back, several cases of the turtles losing one of their flippers and landing ashore in distress had been reported.
 
 A juvenile of a dolphin had washed ashore dead on Saturday at Vithalwada, Morjim and another male dolphin at Ashvem in mid-February.
 
 In May 2016, a dwarf sperm whale died on Palolem beach after being stranded for some time. Animal lovers have expressed the need for setting up a marine mammal stranding response network or some rescue mechanism to tackle increasing cases of injuries and deaths to marine species.
