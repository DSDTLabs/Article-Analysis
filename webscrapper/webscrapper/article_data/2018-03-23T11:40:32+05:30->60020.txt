HYDERABAD: With summer kicking in, the fire department in the city has started receiving an average of six calls almost every day. The calls over the past one month to the Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services Department control room are mostly minor in nature.

 Speaking about steps being taken to prevent any untoward incidents,  , district fire officer for Hyderabad said, “We are conducting a meeting to create an action plan for the summer as fire incidents increase during this time. We have been conducting awareness programmes at the school and college level every Friday. Apart from that, we have been conducting mock drills in Metro stations every Wednesday to educate the staff.”
 
 According to data provided by the state fire department, the number of major fire accidents increased from one case in 2016 to nearly 10 cases in 2017. In such cases property damaged was between ?30 lakh to ?2 crore. Hyderabad has already witnessed two major fire incidents this year, the   said.
 
 “Most minor fire incidents happen due to people being careless while smoking or garbage being dumped in an area that catches fire. Majority of medium and major nature fire mishaps are electrical origin,” said Srinivas.
 
 Another problem is that while summer approaches, offices and homes add to the number of ACs and coolers, but fail to check for fire safety. “Organisations should periodically check appliances,” he said.
