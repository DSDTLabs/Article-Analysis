MUMBAI: Bombay   on Thursday said shortcomings in BMC’s fire safety audits were resulting in incidents like the fire at   Mills compound. BMC informed the court that it was regularly undertaking fire safety audits of restaurants and other premises in Mumbai.

 “The situation on the ground is very different. You may be conducting fire safety audits but there are obviously shortcomings. That is why incidents (like  ) has happened. We are seeing the results,” remarked a division bench of Justices Shantanu Kemkar and Makarand Karnik. Last month, the court had ordered setting up of an independent three-member panel headed by a retired HC judge to go into the “genesis of the unfortunate incident and violations committed”. The fire that broke out at 1Above and Mojo’s Bistro at Kamala Mills compound in Parel on December 29, 2017, had claimed 14 lives and injured 12. 
 
 Senior advocate Vineet Naik, the state government counsel, submitted a short list of recommendations for names to the panel. It shortlisted three HC judges, bureaucrats with experience in town planning and architects. A final decision will be taken by the HC.
 
 “We do not want a paper committee,” the bench told the state. The court told the state’s lawyer to consult BMC’s legal team and finalise a draft of terms of reference and scope of inquiry to be conducted by the committee. The state has also been told to decided the infrastructure and manpower for the panel, along with honorarium to be paid to members, transport facilities and office space. “Do not just confine to the fire incident. Suggest remedial measures so that such incidents do not occur again,” said the bench. The court has scheduled the next hearing on March 19.
