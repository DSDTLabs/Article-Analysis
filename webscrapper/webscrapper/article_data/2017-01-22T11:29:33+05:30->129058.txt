JAIPUR: City doctors put a 72-year-old heart patient having blockages in all three arteries with poor condition of lungs on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for conducting rotablator angioplasty.

 According to the doctors of a private hospital, since the patient had blockages in all three arteries, coronary artery bypass surgery was deemed high risk due to poor lung condition.
 
 The patient had complained of shortness of breath and chest pain on minimal activity. Over past five months, the patient’s condition deteriorated and his heart function decreased. “The only option left was angioplasty which was a high risk procedure due to calcified blockages and decreased heart function,” said Dr  , interventional cardiologist at a private hospital.
 
 Dr Rao said that they have used the   for the first time in the hospital. It is used for patients with high risk due to poor lung and heart condition.
 
 Before conducting the ROTA angioplasty, the doctors conducted a test to establish viability in his heart muscle, which means that if the blockages are opened his heart pumping power would increase.
 
 “We decided to do ECMO ROTA angioplasty. ECMO is a temporary heart lung machine which provides support to the heart during these interventions. The calcified blockage was treated with ROTA angioplasty. Rotablator angioplasty requires drilling inside the arteries in order to break the calcium. This high risk angioplasty was successfully completed. The patient recovered very well and was discharged after seven days,” Dr Rao said.
 
 He said that the maximum benefit of any therapy is achieved when ‘right therapy is offered to the right patient at the right time’.
