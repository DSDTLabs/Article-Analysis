In the past 45 months ­ from April 2013 to December 2016 -Muktsar witnessed a spurt in suicides as nearly 350 farmers ended their lives with an average of nearly eight suicides every month. Prior to that, 450 farm hands had committed suicide in 13 years.

 The figures have been calculated by the `Centre for Research in Economic Change' of the Punjabi University , Patiala. The centre had undertaken the field survey till December 2016 to count farm suicides and is preparing the final report for six other districts -Faridkot, Fatehgarh Sahib, Patiala, Mohali, Ropar and Hoshiarpur.
 
 Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana and   (GNDU), Amritsar have done a similar survey in the other 15 districts of the state. During the survey undertaken from 2000 to 2010, 122 farm hands had committed suicide in Mukt sar. Of these, 58 were farmers and 64 were farm labourers. Fifty out of 58 farmers and 52 out of 64 labourers were under debt.
 
 The survey conducted by Punjabi University has calculated 690 suicides till December 2016. This also includes 260 cases left out from the previous survey and the suicides till March 2013 and 78 cases where debt was not the reason, said the centre officials.
 
 On an average, 18 farm suicides per lakh of population were recorded in Punjab from 2000 to 2010. The average in the latest survey is yet to be calculated.
 
 In the survey conducted till 2010, 6,926 farm hands had committed suicide. Out of these, 3,954 were farmers and 2973 were farm labourers. A whopping 2,943 farmers had committed suicides due to debt, which is 74% of the total cases, and 59% labourers had ended lives due to debt.
 
 Prof Sukhpal Singh, head of PAU's economics and sociology department, who is also the nodal officer for all three universities conducting the farm suicide survey , said, “As per the provisional figures, the suicide rate in the farm sector has increased in recent years. It has been felt more in the cotton belt due to crop failure in 2015. Punjab has nearly 20 lakh farmers and 15 lakh farm labourers. As per the earlier suicide rate of 18 per lakh per year, it is expected to rise. The suicides mainly have been committed by farmers with less than five acres of land and landless labourers who have no other means of living.“
 
 In Muktsar's neighbouring Faridkot district, 37 suicides were reported from 2010 till March 2013 and 25 such cases from April 2013 to December 2016.In Patiala, 140 cases of farm suicides were reported from 2010 till March 2013 and 93 cases have been reported from April 2013 to December 2016.
 
 Prof Sukhwinder Singh of Centre for Research in Economic Change, Punjabi University said, “We have completed the survey till December 2016 in seven districts, including Muktsar, and the final report is being prepared. Hopefully we will hand over the report to state government by middle of April.“
