CHENNAI: A team of researchers from   (UAS), Bengaluru tested   to grow crops and found that they not only grow better, but the nutrient level in the soil also improves.

 Former professor from   said they tested three types of   collected from dry flush toilets, composted fecal sludge from pit toilets and sewage sludge from sewage plants on eight different crops. He presented the study in Fecal Sludge Management conference earlier this week. “ Our objective behind was to look for an alternative source of nutrition for soil and plants, as fertilizer costs has escalated and their indiscriminate use is affecting the soil health,” he said.
 
 Eight crops included finger millets, soyabean, chilli, field beans, ladies finger, brinjal, maize and cowpea were tested with varying quantities of the fecal waste. The wastes were used along with fertilizers like urea, single superphosphate and potassium chloride to balance the recommended dose of nutrients. 
 
 He explained that there are about 2.4lakh tonnes of nitrogen, 1.3lakh tonnes of phosporus and 1.2lakh tonnes of potassium in the 17.9million cubic meters of sewage and around four million tonnes of sludge is produced in the country every year. These are macro-nutrients required to maintain soil fertility. 
 
 The levels of pathogens like E Coli, Bacillus, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, found in the human wastes and known to cause infections are found in lesser level in the soil post-harvest. “The nutrients in the soil could have suppressed these pathogens. But it requires a separate study to investigate. This will be our next stage of research,” he said.
