AHMEDABAD: We may sing paeans to ‘Maa Narmada’ and extol her for being Gujarat’s lifeline, but like prodigals, our greed is robbing the life of her aquifers and mining her dead—by indiscriminately digging borewells and damming her tributaries.

 A 126-year data available with   (NCA), Indore clearly shows how the overall yield of Narmada river is on an accelerating decline since 1972 and then in the 1990s and by 2021 Gujarat will face a scarier scenario if it does not manage its river and groundwater resources that feed the Narmada. Gujarat government maintains 75% reliance on Narmada, which translates to 28 million acre feet (MAF) flow in the river to take care of its basic needs. Today, Narmada’s average decadal yield or inflow in Gujarat has plummeted from 35 MAF in year 1890 to 14.8 MAF already this year. The result is, despite a 112% rainfall in 2017, Gujarat is still staring at a water crisis.
 
 
  
  
 
 “Typically in case of rivers that are rain fed it is the groundwater from aquifers which percolate and keep the river’s stream-flow alive from within. When we have thousands of borewells drawing water indiscriminately, we sap life out of such rain-fed rivers,” says a senior NCA official. The official adds, “Another major factor is the faulty town planning in 30 years across Gujarat that failed to respect topographical contours and allowed construction on natural water courses that fed our rivers.”
 
 On Friday, NCA member ( ),   had warned, “We are mining our groundwater to dangerous levels. In 11 villages of Nandurbar bordering Gujarat ground water levels have plummeted to 1,000 feet from 200 feet.”
 
 In just two years —2017 and 2016—Narmada’s water inflow has decreased by 40%. The Gujarat government won’t provide water to 8.5 lakh hectares for summer crop. Even Tapi, Mahi, Banas, Sabarmati and Panam rivers in Gujarat are facing a rapid decline in their overall ‘yield’.
