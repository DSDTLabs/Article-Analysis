MUZAFFARNAGAR: Tuesday night was tough to live through for 65-year-old   Gupta, who has waited a long time for justice for his murdered son,  , one of three witnesses in the Asaram rape case murdered during the trial, allegedly for deposing against the selfstyled “godman”.

 
 On Wednesday, as Naresh considered the verdict, he hoped his son and the other murdered witnesses would get justice too. “The law has done its work. It is good that Asaram has been convicted. I now hope that the murder case is also decided so that Akhil’s soul rests in peace,” Naresh said.
 
 Akhil was gunned down near his home in   on January 11, 2015. He was among several key witnesses in the rape case and was a former cook and aide to Asaram. So far, three witnesses have been killed and another three have gone missing.
 
 In view of Wednesday’s verdict, Muzaffarnagar police beefed up security for Gupta’s family. In March 2016, Gujarat police arrested  , a devotee of Asaram, for the murder. “Kartik Haldar was arrested. But who is behind Haldar? He is in jail now, but who is looking after his family? All these things should be investigated,” Naresh said.
