NEW DELHI: Union home minister   on Thursday called for diplomatic efforts to build a consensus among countries on sharing river data.

 His statement comes a month after the ministry of external affairs pointed out that China had not shared hydrological data on Sutlej and  , as it was expected under two MoUs, amid major flooding in eastern India.
 
 Inaugurating the 13th formation day of the   (NDMA) here, Singh said hydrological data on rivers should be shared by neighbouring countries for flood mitigation, and a consensus needed to be developed.
 
 The home minister said India was hit by floods every year, and called for diplomatic initiatives to deal with the problem. “Some may ask, what kind of diplomatic efforts should be taken to solve the flood problem? Hydrological data of some rivers that come from another country should be shared... “As of now, I think, there is no such arrangement. I think there should be diplomatic initiatives in this regard. We must try to enhance cooperation and consensus with our neighbouring countries,” he said.
 
 On August 18, the external affairs ministry had said there was an existing expertlevel mechanism, established in 2006. There were two MoUs, it had added, under which China was expected to share hydrological data on the rivers Sutlej and Brahmaputra with India during the flood season of May 15 to June 15.
 
 “For this year, we have not received hydrological data from the Chinese side,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said. However, Kumar added it was “premature” to link it with the floods in   as there could be “technical reasons” behind China not sharing the data. At the time, the two countries were engaged in the border stand-off at the   trijunction.
