HYDERABAD: The city will have to wait for a couple of months more to get a childfriendly special court at   at HACA Bhavan, Adarshnagar.

 Though the court’s infrastructure is likely to be in place by February-end, administration set-up may take time, according to Hyderabad SHE Teams officials.
 
 “The infrastructure work will end soon, but it will take a couple of months for the court administration to start functioning. Also, the inaugural date has not been confirmed yet,” assistant commissioner of police, SHE Teams, D Kavitha.
 
 The designated court, which would ensure speedy disposal of child abuse cases, was supposed to start functioning from January, but got delayed for a variety of reasons. Initially, the Hyderabd police would fund renovation of the court. Later, the   ( ) would provide funds for it regular activities.
 
 “The WCWD has to sanction funds,” she added. The special court would have a child-friendly court hall along with a special room with video conference facility and restroom for the victims. There would be separate rooms for judicial officers, prosecutors, defence advocates and waiting area for common public.
 
 According to ACP Kavitha, the child would be visible to the accused at the time of recording evidence. “It is one of the reasons why this special court is being put in place. It will have a huge impact, mentally, on the minor victims if they are exposed to the accused. However, the accused will be able to hear the   and communicate with his advocate through a one-way mirror,” she added.
