PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Maval MP Shrirang Barne has called for imposing tax on illegal water connections amid growing opposition to doubling of water tax in  .

 “Of the 450 million litre/day (MLD) water supplied to the twin cities, around 150MLD is wasted via leakages, accounting for 38% wastage,” the Maval MP said in a memorandum to civic chief Shravan Hardikar while demanding taxes be imposed on people with illegal water connections.
 
 He said the civic body will get around Rs 50 crore by imposing tax on illegal water connections. “The water supply department has collapsed despite crores of rupees being spent on water supply over the years,” Barne said, adding that the water supply department has implemented the supervision control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for equitable water supply, which is not working properly.
 
 The civic administration had tabled a proposal for doubling the water tax. The proposal, approved by the standing committee, will come up for approval before the general body soon. 
 
 “Under JNNURM and Amrut plans, 24x7 water supply is to be provided to 40% (eight lakh), and 60% (12 lakh) population of the twin cities, respectively,” the Maval MP said. 
 
 Water supply department officials said it will take at least 2-3 years for providing 24x7 water supply as 300MLD water is to be drawn from the Bhama Askhed and Andra dams.
 
 PCMC's budget meeting will be held on Monday, in which corporators will discuss the issues related to water supply. Around six BJP corporators have already sent a letter to Hardikar against doubling the water tax.
