NOIDA: A team of   officials on Wednesday inspected the traffic congestion on the Mahamaya Flyover-Kalindi Kunj route at the instance of Authority chief executive officer (CEO)  . Agarwal himself will inspect the site on Thursday morning and study the gridlock being faced by motorists since January 16, when construction began on an underpass in Sector 94. 

 The Rs 40-crore under-pass project, which has been delayed for more than two years, is meant to make the stretch between   in Delhi and NH-24 signal-free. 
 
 A team of officials led by the additional CEO (ACEO) and two project engineers inspected the site. "We have two major projects being constructed in the area - the underpass and a parallel bridge across the Yamuna near Kalindi Kunj," Agarwal told TOI. 
 
 "However, I realised the magnitude of the problem when I was travelling through the area on Tuesday. We will try our best to ease the gridlock and provide relief to motorists. I will visit the site with the SP (Traffic) on Thursday and come up with some solutions." 
 
 About 250 metres of the stretch has been blocked by the Noida Authority for the construction of the underpass joining sectors 94, 95 and 125 with the Master Plan road III, because of which the vehicles going from Noida to Delhi have been diverted to a curved road that runs along the stretch. After the diversion was brought into effect four days earlier, commuters had a harrowing time as traffic crawled up to a distance of almost one kilometre on the Mahamaya flyover to the   barrage, which joins Noida with Delhi.
 
 Noida Authority project engineer S C Mishra said the congestion would ease in the next four days.
