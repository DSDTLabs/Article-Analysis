Pune: The Chatushrungi police on Monday arrested a man for assaulting and robbing cash from a hotelier based in  , off Senapati Bapat road. The suspect robbed cash worth Rs24,100 from the hotel on Sunday afternoon.

 Senior police inspector Dayanand Dhome of Chatushrungi police station said “The hotel owner, Aabasaheb Deshmukh (42) of Kharadi, had lodged a complaint with the police after the incident. A police team arrested the suspect on Monday.”
 
 Assistant inspector DT Shinde, who is investigating the case, said the police arrested the suspect Amar Jagtap (35) of Janwadi. Jagtap is currently out on bail in a murder case.
 
 On Sunday afternoon, Jagtap went to the hotel and demanded money from Deshmukh. “He generally demands money from local hoteliers. However, Deshmukh refused to give him any. The suspect, who roams around in the area with an iron rod, pulled out the rod and hit Deshmukh on his head upon the refusal. Deshmukh sustained severe head injuries,” he said.
 
 According to Shinde, after striking Deshmukh, Jagtap took away his wallet from his pocket. “He then also stole money from the hotel’s cash box. Later, he just walked out of the hotel as if nothing has happened,” he said. In all, Jagtap robbed Rs24,000 and other documents from the hotel.
 
 “A few years ago, the Chatushrungi police had arrested Jagtap in a murder case. Shinde said that a city court is still hearing the case while he is out on bail. He does not work and regularly demands money from local businessmen,” Dhome said.
