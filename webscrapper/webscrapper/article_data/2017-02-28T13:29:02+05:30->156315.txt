 DIG   said, “Around 30-40 well behaved jail inmates were chosen from all over Maharashtra to be sent to open jail. They were allowed to work openly without any surveillance or barricades.”
 
 Siswas, who neither went on parole or furlough, was working along with others but fled the spot, added Desai. Further he said, “Ideally, the accommodation and other amenities of open jail inmates should be separated, but the facility is yet to be constructed.”
