KOLKATA: It’s the 50th year of his graduation from  , and he decided to make the occasion special. On Friday, he returned to his alma mater with $90,000 as a gift.

The institute on Friday honoured Gupta for his association with it while kickstarting the alumni meet that will be held over the weekend.

 An alumnus of the 1967 batch of the department of agriculture, Gupta went on to become the CEO of a number of companies in the US, including infoGROUP, DatabaseUSA.com and Infofree.com. He was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as a trustee of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. Gupta was also the US consul general to Bermuda and was nominated by the President to be the US ambassador to Fiji.
 
 In 1993, Gupta stunned the academic world by donating $2 million to IIT-Kharagpur to start the first ever b-school inside any IIT. Thus, the   (VGSOM) was set up. A few years later, Gupta felt that like top US campuses, IIT-Kharagpur should also have a law school of its own that would focus on intellectual property rights, which is globally emerging as a new zone for legal inquiries.

 “I consider myself fortunate that I am being able to contribute a bit towards the growth of IIT-Kharagpur, which has made me who I am. Internationalization rules the world of education today. A larger number of exchange programmes, more international students on campus and inbound international faculty will strengthen the institute on the global map,” Gupta told TOI.
