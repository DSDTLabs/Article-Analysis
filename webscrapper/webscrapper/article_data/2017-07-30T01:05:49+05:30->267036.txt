NEW DELHI: Police have arrested a 25-year-old man who targeted Metro commuters and made away with their mobile phones. The accused, Laxmi Kant Dwivedi, used a unique modus operandi—he made sure that he would look different from his previous get-up each time he came to a Metro station. Police said the accused used this trick to avoid getting caught in CCTV cameras.

 His ploy ultimately failed when one of his victims recognised him and he was nabbed while trying to snatch the mobile phone of another commuter at Rajiv Chowk metro station on Wednesday evening. 
 
 A mobile theft was reported at the   station. A team immediately went to the station, where the complainant,  , told the cops that he was heading towards Huda City Centre from Rajiv Chowk, when a man pushed him from behind and then suddenly disappeared. Later, when he checked his pockets, he found that his phone was missing.
 
 The next day, a police team in civvies accompanied Mehtab to the same Metro station. After waiting for over an hour, he spotted Dwivedi though the latter looked different. This time, he wore a turban and his facial hair looked darker.
 
 “A team led by SHO (INA Metro) Rajeev Kumar initiated an investigation and questioned the accused,” said  , deputy commissioner of police (Metro).
 
 During investigations, Dwivedi confessed to his involvement in many crimes. Cops claim to have solved around 10 cases of pickpocketing and mobile thefts, with his arrest.
 
 Dwivedi told the cops that he belonged to a poor family. A Class VI dropout, he took to petty crimes to meet the financial needs of his family.
