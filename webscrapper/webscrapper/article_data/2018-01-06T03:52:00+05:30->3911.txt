Panaji: Minister for agriculture and town and country planning   Sardesai said that Goa needs to reorient its tourism policy towards high-end foreign tourists while seeking ways to discourage domestic tourists who come in buses and do not contribute to the state’s economy.

 Disagreeing on the strategy of successive governments to increase tourist footfalls, Sardesai said that the state tourism department and the government must focus on attracting quality tourists.
 
 “Goa should become so expensive that tourists should say that it is not worth coming to Goa. Which tourists … the Indian tourists. We must have high end facilities and get high end tourism, which benefits the sons of the soil,” Sardesai said.
 
 The minister and GFP supremo was referring to the busloads of tourists who camp and cook on roadside in the state, especially along the coastal belt.
 
 “Why do we need these common tourists? It is not only about quantity, but also about quality of tourists coming to Goa. They say that today 64 lakh tourists come and we will take it to 1 crore. You don’t need them. Reduce the numbers and instead bring the high spenders in,” Sardesai said.
 
 The minister accepted that for Goa to attract high-quality tourists, good infrastructure was required, which was lacking. It was also vital to ensure that traditional occupations were protected and sustained. 
 
 “If we are trying to get in high end tourists, we need good infrastructure. If the family comes, have the children got any entertainment? Is there something of repute? We don’t have that,” Sardesai said.
