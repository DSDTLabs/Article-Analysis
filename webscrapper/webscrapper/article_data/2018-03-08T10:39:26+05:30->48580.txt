TRICHY: The district witnessed widespread protests from various political parties following the contentious tweet of BJP leader H   declaring that the statues of Periyar would be pulled down like that of   in Tripura, on Wednesday.

 However,   in   remained silent on the issue choosing not take to the street condemning the issue. DMK, CPM and CPI staged demonstrations against Raja for his controversial remark on the social reformist.
 
 The silence of the ruling party, despite being a Dravidian movement, did not go down well with the other parties. “It is not a silence but is an inactiveness of the state government,” said DMK Rajya Sabha MP  .
 
 “Not just political parties, but the general public is agitating across the state whereas the state government responsible for maintaining law and order remain mute. They are claiming that they follow the principles of Periyar and Anna but are not doing so in real,” Siva told TOI.
 
 Both the communist parties joined hands and staged a demonstration near   in Palakkarai in Trichy in the morning. Later, they took part in the demonstration organised by DMK leaders by KN Nerhu at Jayanthi bus stop in Woraiyur in the evening.
