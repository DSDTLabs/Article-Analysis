HYDERABAD: Self-styled godman  , accused of confining women and girls in his ashrams in north India, surfaced at Tadepalligudem in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. Locals grew suspicious of his activities at the centre he established there recently and knocked the high court door seeing a probe. 

 Dixit set up a centre at Savitrupeta residential area in the name of Adhyatmik Vishwa Vidyalaya, Chandigarh, in a 3- storied building and was seen moving only with women.
 
 Justice AV Sesha Sai of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday directed the SP of West Godavari district to file a report on the alleged suspicious activities taking place at the centre.
 
  According to G Srinu and five other residents of Savitrupeta, who approached the high court, the Baba was entertaining and moving only with women and wanted a probe into the 'suspicious' activities at the centre during the late hours everyday.
 
 The petitioners also enclosed the recent media reports pertaining to the flash raid conducted by Swati Maliwal, chairperson of the  , with the help of the   and police on the centre at Mohan Garden area of West Delhi's  , in December 2017 wherein 41 women inmates were rescued. The Baba has been absconding since then and has surfaced in AP, the counsel for the petitioners said. Though the Baba is claiming that he was conducting spiritual classes, the veracity of such statements is being doubted by locals who are witnessing the entry of strangers into the centre during late in the night.
 
 The petitioners informed the court that already, 25 women from their district too have become 'captives' there and anti-social activities were going on in the area. "There is a need to raid this centre and rescue the women here too," they said. They also brought to the notice of the court the direction given by the Delhi High Court asking the CBI to produce Baba Virendra Dev Dixit before it by Jan 4, 2018.
