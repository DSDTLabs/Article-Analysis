MUMBAI: The Bombay high court cleared the way on Thursday for application of 2015 rules laying down height restrictions for buildings in zones around the   by disposing of a PIL filed in 2014 against violations by advocate  .

 A division bench of Justices   and   said it was keeping all contentions on the validity of the rules as well matters concerning civil aviation safety open, which means that the petitioner can challenge these norms introduced by the civil aviation ministry or their implementation.
 
 
  
 
 The judges indicated they would pass separate orders on individual cases, such as floors of buildings earmarked for demolition or permission for going above the permitted height, or projects stuck for want of permissions on Friday. They would be directed to the relevant authorities created for taking decision on height restrictions for buildings.
 
 Shenoyâ€™s PIL had claimed that the safety of air passengers as well as persons staying in the vicinity of the airport in Mumbai was at risk because building height norms were not being observed. According to the law, based on international norms, height norms have to be implemented in areas falling within a 20km radius around the airport and builders need a no-objection certificate from authorities. It referred to reports of obstructions in the take-off and landing areas and near miss accidents recorded in the last few years to support its plea for intervention by the court. A report by the authorities revealed that between 2012 and 2017, over 300 new obstacles had come up around the airport.
 
 In 2015, the civil aviation ministry brought in new rules, including a colour-coded map detailing height restrictions around the existing Mumbai airport and the proposed Navi Mumbai airport. To construct abuilding in a zone close to the airport, an NOC for height clearance from the   is a must. As one moves away from the airport, the permissible height goes up.
