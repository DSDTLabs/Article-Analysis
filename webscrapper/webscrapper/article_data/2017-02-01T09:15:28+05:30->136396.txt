HYDERABAD: A doctor doing   (CPR) on an   has been served a memo by   medical college for not taking an MLA's call as he was busy. Dr V Vineeth, senior resident (general surgery), is doing his compulsory one-year rural stint at the hospital. 

 "Disciplinary action will be initiated against him if he fails to explain within two days," hospital superintendent Dr L Ramulu warned in a memo (TOI has a copy) dated Jan 27, three days after the incident. The memo said that Nizamabad (rural) MLA   had called to know the condition of the woman, Manemma, whom the doctor was treating. 
 
 "How can one expect a doctor performing CPR to respond to a call when it is the job of hospital administrator. I was informed that he tried to get in touch with the MLA later," said Telangana junior doctors' association (TJUDA) president Dr G Srinivas. In fact, TJUDA said that director of medical education Dr M Ramani's circular issued early this month clearly states that "there was no provision to take action against senior residents as they are under compulsory one year government services under GO 107". 
 
 Hospital superintendent Dr Ramulu, however, said that it was a 'nominal memo' with no intention of taking action against him, adding that he was a registered   degree holder and it was his responsibility to respond. Unfortunately, the patient from Dichpally died soon after being shifted to a nearby private hospital.
