Coimbatore: A 45-year-old man and his 24-year-old son, who posed as soothsayers and stole a pair of silver anklets, a mixer grinder and Rs 400 from a house at Mahadevapuram in Mettupalayam on Thursday evening, were caught red-handed and thrashed by the public before handed over to the police. They were identified as T Selvaraj and his son S Prabhu from Thamaraikulam. “They had turned up at the house of Semina, wife of Raja from Mahadevapuram on Thursday evening. Selvaraj asked Raja to buy edible oil from a nearby shop. After the man left the house, Selvaraj gave Semina a powder, asking her to consume the ‘holy ash’. The woman, who had it, fainted immediately. Making use of the opportunity, the duo stole a mixer grinder, a pair of silver anklets and Rs 400 from the house. When Raja returned from the shop, the duo also fed him the ‘holy ash’, rendering him unconscious,” a police officer said.  “The duo managed to escape from the place and visited Mahadevapuram on Friday morning. They told people that they can predict the future. Growing suspicious over their actions, the locals informed Raja, who rushed to the place and identified them. Soon, a group of angry residents surrounded the duo and beat them up. They were later handed over to Mettupalayam police,” the officer added.
