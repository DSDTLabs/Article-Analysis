GANDHINAGAR: The rural development department of the state government has come up with a solution to help small businesses, including MSMEs and traders, comply with GST requirements, and also to generate employment up to block level. Mona Khandhar, commissioner and secretary rural development department said, “The   (GLPC) under the state rural development department has developed its own platform, GST Suvidha Provider (GSP), to bring GST compliance within the reach of small businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).”

 Kandhar added, “This will also create job opportunities for youth to work as GST Sahayaks (assistants), as we will be setting up GST Suvidha Kendras up to block level.”
 
 Speaking about the viability of the vision, Kandhar said, “With regard to its strength, GLPC has a state-wide network to realize the vision. It can train youth at centres in each district, can set up GST Suvidha Kendras at each block, tie up with   (GIPL) for ICT services, and it has also made agreement with   (GSTN) for the purpose.”
 
 Kandhar said the GST compliance consultation provided by the GSP will be bilingual, in Gujarati and English, with Hindi to be introduced later.
 
 Observing that the centres can significantly increase GST collection, Kandhar said, “At the time of stakeholders consultation for formulating the “Goods and Service Tax Framework,” everybody was concerned primarily with the question as to how the MSME segment will cope with compliance costs and ICT platform of GST.” 
 
 Kandhar pointed out that the tax collection from MSMEs was lower though the number of individual units was higher than in other sectors.
