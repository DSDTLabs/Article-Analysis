NEW DELHI: If you intend to sell your   to a used car  , from now on, you would also have to be present when the registration certificate is transferred to the new owner. 

 The   department has made transfer of RCs an online process, which would require the presence of both parties to sign transfer papers. 
 
 “In most cases, people would sign forms 28 and 30 to transfer   and keep those with the dealers, who fill in details only upon finding a buyer. This is illegal,” said an official. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Rules say an RC has to be transferred within 30 days of sale of a vehicle. But for a used car, it could be months. “With the process becoming online, the forms would be generated online and both the buyer and seller will have to be present to sign the document. This will ensure transparency and curb malpractices,” the official said. 
 
 A printout of the form would have to be signed by both and then deposited with other documents, including the original RC, address proof, pollution under control certificate and insurance papers.
 
 “The documents can be sent to the RTO via speed post or deposited in designated drop boxes at the transport offices. There would also be designated counters for those who want to submit the documents by hand,” the official said.
 
 After submitting the documents, applicants would have to visit the RTO only if there is any discrepancy. “The buyer will be intimated by SMS,” the official added. 
 
 “The responsibility of transferring the RC is with the original owner, and s/he should know who the vehicle is sold to. It doesn’t often happen when the vehicle is sold to a used car dealer,” the official, adding, “With the new system in place, owners should insist on delivering the vehicle only when the dealer finds a buyer.”
