 Elaborating on the system, collector Vivek Yadav said, “As many as 281 e-Pos machines and tablets have been made available for dealers in the district. There is a deficit of 70 machines and we will get them soon.”
 
 The collector also urged the revenue officials to ensure that bank accounts of all farmers are linked to Aadhaar so that every farmer gets the benefits.
