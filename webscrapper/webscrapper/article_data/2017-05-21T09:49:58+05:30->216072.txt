LUCKNOW: When   wanted to meet his younger brother, mafia don turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari-lodged in the Agra jail for 12 years now -he made his way to the   which was in session through the week and Mukhtar was allowed to leave jail and attend it. For five days since Monday, since the Assembly session began, he met his younger brother in the lobby of the Assembly building in between sessions.

 Mukhtar has been in jail for his alleged involvement in the killing of Krishanand Rai in   in 2005. As prime accused, he has been moving from one jail to another. However, he has been contesting and winning elections in 2007, 2012 and 2017 from behind bars. Sibghatullah, who has also been an MLA, lost the Assembly election this year to Alka Rai, wife of the slain   MLA Krishnand Rai from Mehmudabad in Ghazipur while Mukhtar won from Mau.
 
 “Main to yahi dua karta hoon ki mera bhai jaldi se chhoot jaye (I pray that my brother gets released soon),“ said Sibghatullah Ansari (67). Sibghatullah takes care of his brother's constituency, acting as a bridge between the imprisoned Mukhtar and the district administration and the government for development works to be done in Mau and to redress griev ances of his voters. The court had granted permission to Mukhtar to attend Assembly proceedings only and not move out beyond the Vidhan Sabha complex.
 
 “The first question I asked him when we met at the Assembly was about his health,“ said Sibghatullah for whom, travelling over 300 km from his native district Ghazipur to the jail in Agra jail is a tough proposition.
 
 MLAs in the House have been witnessing the brothers meeting every day between sessions, hugging each other, Mukhtar inquiring about his family and Sibghatullah concerned about Mukhtar's health.
