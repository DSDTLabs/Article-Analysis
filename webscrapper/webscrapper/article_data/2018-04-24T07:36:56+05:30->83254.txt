BHOPAL:   raised strong objections over conducting   without cancelling previous exam. Students had objected to the Barkatullah University’s decision of changing minimum marks to qualify entrance test for Ph D and M Phil.

 The university had earlier announced re-exam would be organised on April 22, which was extended to May.
 
 The decision has not gone down well with the aspirants. “This is mockery of the exam. Ideally, the university should have scrapped previous exam and conducted fresh exam,” said a student without quoting his name.
 
 BU allowed those students who had cleared previous exam to give a miss to exam. It has been made optional for students to appear for exam again. “This is funny. I have never heard of conducting exam in this manner. Why few students are given an opportunity to skip exam?” said another student.
 
 When contacted, registrar UN Shukla said BU is conducting exam for their benefit. “We had extended the date to give another opportunity to students. I am surprised if anyone is objecting to it,” said Shukla.
 
 Shukla said, “It is optional for students to write exam, who were declared pass. If they have any doubt, they can also write. After second exam, merit will be changed and student can’t complain after re-exam that they were not given the opportunity.” Entrance exam for admission in PhD course became mandatory after the   ( ) 2009 rule came into existence. The doctorate would not be treated valid in case rule is not executed.
