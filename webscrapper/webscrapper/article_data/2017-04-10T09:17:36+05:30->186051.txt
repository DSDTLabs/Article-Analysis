CHENNAI: Metro rail authorities will step up frequency of safety checks to monitor settling of soil in the coming days to prevent untoward incidents while completing boring for the last 1.7km tunnel between Thousand Lights and DMS. The stretch is part of the   of the airport corridor.

 The number of minor road caveins that had happened in the past few years, though metro rail authorities have been constantly monitoring the status of the shifting o f soil , h av e raised concerns among residents. Officials said they were able to minimise the incidents. Minister D Jayakumar said, “We have not seen the kind of accidents that had happened in New Delhi during metro rail work.“
 
 As boring tunnels is fraught with challenges, metro rail conducted soil tests before and during the tunnelling, and fixed instruments to gauge settling of soil and study cracks on buildings. However, the incident took the officials by surprise because they had been constantly monitoring the surface as there was loose soil beneath. “This has happened without any indication. We have been taking all safety precautions but will increase frequency of the checks in the coming days after the stretch is repaired and traffic is restored,“ said a metro rail official.Though it was estimated that traffic would resume in the evening, the official said there was a possibility of it being restored on Monday morning. This is the third incident of a road cave-in in which vehicles fell into craters.
 
 The first one was near Dasa Prakash on Poonamallee High Road on February 2013 while another one was on the same road near Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital opposite Central railway station in June 2015.
