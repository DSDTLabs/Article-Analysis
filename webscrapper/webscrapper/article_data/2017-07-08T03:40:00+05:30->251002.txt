Nagpur: A 37-year-old woman, mother of three children, was sold to a family in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia for Rs two lakhs in September last year by luring her with a cooking job with the Umrah pilgrims. This is second such case of trafficking women as human slave surfacing in city. The earlier case was also registered at Sakkardara police station.  In the latest case, Kanija Begum approached Sakkardara police stating that her younger sister has been sold off to a person Sheikh in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia through agents Samma, Sayyed, Mohd Alfaz-ur-Rahim Jabbar alias Haji Sahab and Mumbai-based Mustafa. Apart from Mustafa, the rest of the agents are based in city. Sakkardara police have registered an offence of trafficking against Sheikh and four agents. One of the agents, Haji Sahab, has been so far arrested.  It has been learnt that the victim woman was compelled by her circumstances to take up the foreign assignment as her husband has been left crippled by an accident and also the mounting debts on him. The victim has been forced to work several hours at Sheikh’s residence without adequate food. A younger male in the family too learnt to have made undue advances towards her. She has been repeatedly thrashed and threatened by the Sheikh’s family who have now agreed to free her only upon a payment of Rs two lakhs which they had paid to the agents.  In the earlier case too, Sakkardara polices’ role was questionable in which they opted to give long rope to the Tajbagh-based woman agent without arresting her.  Kanija, helped by activist and veteran journalist Umesh Choubey and his team comprising Savita Pandey and Sunita Thakre, said to TOI that she has been repeatedly getting threats of dire consequences from Mustafa and others for registering offence. “The agents are threatening to eliminate my younger sister for approaching police,” she said.
