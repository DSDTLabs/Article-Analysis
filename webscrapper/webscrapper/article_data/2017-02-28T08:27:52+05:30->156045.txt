CHENNAI: The September 9, 2016 order of Madras high court, imposing blanket ban on registration of   and conversion of farm lands into residential layouts, will continue to hold good for some more time, as   refused to vacate the interim order on Monday.

 A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice R  , making it clear that they were not inclined to interfere with the earlier order of the bench, however, asked the state government to come out with a comprehensive policy which will not adversely affect any section of people.
 
 The bench remained unmoved in a packed hall where a battery of lawyers representing developers, builders and individual land owners argued that the worst-affected were small land owners. Additional advocate-general Ayyadurai submitted that the government proposed to categorise the lands into four divisions â€” recognised, unrecognised, wetlands and dry lands.
 
 The bench asked the additional advocate-general to take an immediate policy decision, keeping in view different categories of people, and come out with a comprehensive with a solution at an early date. 
 
 The bench then adjourned the hearing to March 28.
 
 It all started with a PIL filed by advocate and animal rights activist Elephant G Rajendran, who sought ban on indiscriminate conversion of farm lands into residential layouts by promoters without following due process of law. 
 
 Having secured an interim order, which has resulted in pile up of unsold inventory of unapproved layouts running into several lakhs, he has now offered a formula for regularising such lands. 
 
 During last hearing he filed a memo narrating the procedure, and the bench asked authorities to consider it. According to Rajendran, if developers remit Rs 20 lakh per acre of land, government could consider it, as the money could be used to restore the lands to their original condition.
