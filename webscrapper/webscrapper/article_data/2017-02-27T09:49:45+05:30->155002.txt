JAIPUR: Expecting a lot of firework inside as well as outside assembly during the ongoing Budget session, the state government is attempting to rein in the demonstrators holding protests outside. Organizations will now have to seek more permission from authorities to hold dharna and exercise their right to protest. 

 Protests, a frequent feature when assembly is in session may now be a thing of the past. For the demonstrators, it would now be mandatory to submit an affidavit on Rs 100 notary stating that their protests will be peaceful. Along with it organizations will also have to furnish no-objection-certificate from discom and fire department. 
 
 So far, only permission from police was needed. It is for the first time that permission from three different departments will be required to hold protest at assembly now on. The Budget session began from February 23. 
 
 Meanwhile, civil society has raised their voice against these provisions. “This move curtails our democratic right. Already spaces for holding demonstrations are shrinking, this will further squeeze the limited space,” said   of   (MKSS). 
 
 Members from other groups and NGOs too have expressed their apprehensions on the new conditions laid. “It is a curb on our right to protest. Government is creating more barriers as all permissions need to be sought from the government departments. It is getting difficult to even make your voice heard,” said  , convener of  , Rajasthan.
 
 Asserting that demonstrators have always needed to give in writing, police claim that there is nothing unusual. They maintained that it is up to the investigating officer whether they are satisfed with just an application or want it as an affidavit.
 
 “This is not the first time that this is happening. Before each protest, procession, demonstration or religious ceremony, organizers have to pledge in writing to follow rules,” said  , ACP, Jaipur police.
