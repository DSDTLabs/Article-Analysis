JAIPUR:  , well-known as  , gave a presentation on the last day of the  , titled ‘Shakespeare’s Restless World’.

 The presentation focused on the lives of the bard’s first audiences. “It was a rough life,” McGregor said. Baiting bears with dogs was seen as entertainment. Those accused of treason could be beheaded, their heads were exhibited on stakes. The execution of ‘criminals’ was public entertainment too. So, Shakespeare’s audience could well have witnessed a public execution earlier in the day and then proceeded to watch a play.
 
 The 16th century was the time of the Protestant Revolution – so in many Shakespeare plays there would be older characters whose language gave away traces of Catholicism. It was a crime to be a Jesuit or to publicly profess Catholicism. However, there is material evidence to show that some Catholics continued to hold on to their faith, in disguise. A box containing the material needed to conduct a mass was disguised as a common worker’s bag.
 
 Audiences would be required to add scenery through their own imagination, so Shakespeare would tell them: “Piece out our imperfections with your own thoughts”.
 
 While there were public clocks in that age, the domestic clock was beginning to make an appearance in some wealthy homes in the 1570s – the tick-tock of the pendulum clock thus became a new experience, a new ‘noise of time’ that generations before had never known.
 
 Shakespeare was a shareholder in the theatre company. To name a theatre ‘Globe’ in that time, McGregor pointed out, was akin to naming something the ‘Internet’ these days – the first globe was only just made at that time. The theatre promised to bring to audiences the whole world at a time when only two men – Francis Drake and Ferdinand Magellan – were known to have travelled around the world.
