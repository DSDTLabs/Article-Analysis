CUTTACK:   doesn't believe in hiding his emotions. On a day he cracked his highest individual ODI score, the Punjab southpaw revealed he had thought about giving up the game after being dropped from the team.

 “When I came back from cancer it was hard work. I was not performing and after being dropped I thought (about) whether I wanted to continue or not,” Yuvraj said, crediting `hard work' for the change in his fortunes. “I don't read newspapers, neither do I watch television. I don't like to put too much pressure on myself. I had a good run in the  , so was just waiting to make it count big.”
 
 
 
 
 
 The 35-year-old Yuvraj and MS Dhoni had often been the pivot of an India victory, and Yuvraj said, “MS and I we have previously won quite a number of matches for India. He has been an experienced guy and it was great to see the way he put it to use.”
 
  
  
 
 
 Not to forgetting to mention Virat Kohli, Yuvraj added, “Virat showed a lot of faith and belief in me. 150 is my highest.”
 
 England skipper Eoin Morgan, on the other hand, seemed a bit despondent. “We messed it up with the ball again. At 253 we allowed two experienced guys to settle down. That was bound to hurt us. I am very disappointed. We believed we could make it. We have been learning all the time. It will be a good preparation for the Champions Trophy. The wicket (here) is not the typical Indian turner that one gets. It's different. They are good batting wickets.”
 
 Although gutted with the outcome, Morgan, much like his teammate Jos Butler, batted for the IPL. “I would definitely want them (England players) to come and play in the IPL. The auction will be shortly here.”
