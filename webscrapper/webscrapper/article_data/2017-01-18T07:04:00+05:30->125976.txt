CHANDIGARH: A woman from a village in Fatehabad district has accused the sarpanch and a member of the panchayat of attempting to rape her. On the other hand, the accused sarpanch has produced a video showing the woman tearing her clothes to frame him in the case.

 On January 14, Fatehabad police had booked sarpanch Ramesh Chand and a panchayat member on the complaint moved by the woman. During investigations, Ramesh had handed over a video grab of the   cameras installed in the gram panchayat office.
 
 In her police complaint, the victim alleged that she had approached Chand and other panchayat members in a case related to her burning wood on the panchayat land. She accused Chand and the panchayat member of tearing off her clothes and attempting to rape her.
 
 However, the CCTV footage shows her going into the sarpanch’s office along with her two daughters and son. Inside, she has some argument and walks out of the room. The footage also shows her tearing her clothes and pulling the panchayat member towards her.
 
 Fatehabad assistant superintendent of polie (ASP) G R Punia said, “Investigations are in progress and appropriate action will follow in the matter,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the sarpanch has moved a counter complaint, accusing the woman and her children of misleading the police by making frivilous allegations to frame them.
