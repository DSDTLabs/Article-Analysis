MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday refused to stay cases filed by the All Women Police in Pudukottai, Tuticorin district and Thisayanvilai police in Tirunelveli against Rajya Sabha member and expelled AIADMK leader  . The court directed the government counsel to file a status report before it on February 13. 

 The case concerns the sexual harassment complaint filed against Pushpa, husband   and son Pradeep Raja by two women who worked as domestic helps in their house. Based on it, the All-Women Police had registered a case against them. Subsequently, On October 11, a group of people ransacked the house of advocate J Suganthi who represented the domestic helps in the case. Following this, the advocate's relative Muthu had lodged a complaint with the Thisayanvilai police who arrested three people in this regard - Ramalingam, Sathiyachitra Kumar and   alias Hari Nadar. Based on their confessional statements, the police had also registered cases against the Rajya Sabha member and her relatives.
 
 Seeking to quash both the cases, Pushpa and her relatives filed petitions before the Madras high court Madurai bench. On Thursday, when the petitions came up for hearing before  , additional advocate general (AAG) said the petitioners did not cooperate with the police investigation in violation of the Supreme Court direction. 
 
 "The petitioners had already approached the Supreme Court regarding the cases. The court in turn had asked them to cooperate with the investigation. Though the police issued four summons, the accused who received the same did not turn up for the inquiry even today. Their petitions are nothing but an effort to circumvent the summons. Besides, the investigation is in a crucial stage. The police are examining many witnesses and also recording statements from them," the AAG said.
