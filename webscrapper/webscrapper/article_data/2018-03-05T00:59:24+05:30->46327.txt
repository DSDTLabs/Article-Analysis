Guntur: The state government’s unilateral decision to implement   system in the country’s biggest agriculture market  , in Guntur, is likely to push farmers into more trouble as traders are unwilling to take active part in purchases. 

 The reluctance of merchants to trade is expected to result in price drop, and cause irreparable loss to the farmers. Chilli farmers, who incurred heavy losses in the last season, are worried about the repeat of another crisis.
 
 The season had, in fact, kicked off on a high note as the low-quality chilli, too, was purchased at Rs 9,000-Rs 10,000 per quintal while premium varieties were picked up at Rs 12,000-Rs 14,000 per quintal. The controversy over payments and subsequent suspension of sales in the past two days had brought the prices down by Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500 per quintal. 
 
 Farmers are worried that prices might go down further if the   is hit by continuous controversies. Surprisingly, senior officials, who are overseeing the issue, are further creating panic in the market. “They can’t make us purchase by threatening us to arrest,” said a commission agent.
 
 Trouble started with the marketing department insisting on clearing the entire dues of farmers within 24 hours, while the traders are seeking at least 15 days’ time. “There is no provision under e-nam to grant 15 days’ time. Traders are only trying to scuttle the farmer-friendly system,” said market yard chairman Mannava Subbarao.
 
 Sources in the trading community said chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his ministers were completely misled by senior officials who painted the traders as villains in entire issue to escape from their failures. Senior officials are said to be insisting the traders to implement the e-nam system only to prove their authority without properly studying the implications of the implementation, the sources alleged.
 
 Although, e-nam is a system developed by the Centre to provide better prices to the farmers, the choice of joining the national electronic market system has been left to the state government. In a hurry to draw huge sums from the Centre for modernisation of markets under e-nam system, the state government had included Guntur market yard in the list for the launch of e-nam last year. After experiencing initial troubles, the marketing department deferred the implementation of e-nam to the current season.
 
 Surprisingly, the department did not take any measures to do a trial run of the system to handle huge volume of arrivals before making it mandatory on the traders. Without taking stakeholders and merchants into confidence, the marketing department threatened the traders of not renewing their licenses if they did not give undertaking to participate in the purchases through e-nam.
 
 A chilli merchant said: “We have no objection to participate in the e-nam. Unfortunately, the officials are creating more troubles as they are unwilling to listen to the grievances of the traders and set things right.” 
 
  GFX:
 
  *Enam has been made mandatory in Guntur agriculture market yard from the current season
 
  *Under e-nam, payment to farmers must be made within 24 hours of purchase
 
  *Commission agents, the primary merchants, argue they get payments from exporters only after 15 days, and hence they that much time to clear dues
 
  *At the prevailing prices, traders require Rs 100 crore of liquid cash to purchase 1 lakh bags daily
 
  *Even if the arrivals are around 50,000 bags, merchants have to shell out Rs 50 crore almost daily, which they argue is an impossible task
 
  *Insistence on immediate payment would force traders to keep out of the purchases, and result in further crisis in the market
