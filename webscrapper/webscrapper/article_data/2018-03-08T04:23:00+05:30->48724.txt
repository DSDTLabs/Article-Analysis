Vadodara: A businessman registered a case of extortion against a car service station owner and his man after the accused allegedly took away Rs 4 lakh and then demanded another Rs 10 lakh.

 The accused Nitin Agrawal, a resident of Gotri, had lost Rs 8 lakh in cricket betting with the accused Rajesh alias Akku Patel for which he had been demanding money from the latter.
 
 In his complaint, Agrawal told the police that he had been regularly placing bets on cricket matches with Patel since 2015. Last month, he lost around Rs 8 lakh in his bets on India-South Africa T20 cricket matches and matches of Pakistan cricket league to Patel. The accused and his man Jaideep alias Jetho used to call him for money and Agrawal kept dilly dallying.
 
 In one of the calls, Jaideep said that Agrawal will have to give Rs 14 lakh and when he said that he owes Rs 8 lakh, Jaideep came to his office and took Rs 4 lakh forcibly. On March 1, Jaideep came to Agrawal’s house to demand Rs 10 lakh and even threatened to kill him. Two days later, he reached Agrawal’s office in Fatehgunj when he was not present and called him for money. He told Agrawal that he will not leave from there until he gets his money. Later, when Agrawal’s staff called police control room, he went away from there.
 
 On Monday, Jaideep again called Agrawal and asked him to come to Harinagar crossroads in Gotri with money or else he will be killed. Agrawal then, instead of going to meet Jaideep, went to Gotri police station and gave his complaint.
 
 Police said that Agrawal had got into cricket betting in 2009 when he started facing losses in his business. But after some months when he suffered losses in betting, he stopped it but again started in 2015.
