KOLKATA: The two women worked in perfect coordination, zeroing in on their targets and robbing them of their valuables by a sleight of hand right in the heart of the city, New Market. While one would strike up a conversation with an unsuspecting victim, the other would pick his pocket with elan.

  But what set the duo apart from other pickpockets was that Siuli Akhtar and Dalia Akhtar were Bangladeshi nationals, who had come to India on a proper passport and tourist visa. Moreover, both were travelling with their husbands and children.
  
  
 Residents of Dhaka, Siuli and Dalia, along with their husbands, had been staying at a hotel on   for the past one week. Every evening, the two would go “shopping” in New Market and return with a bagful of valuables and goodies, apparently much to the surprise of their husbands. The police pointed out that though the two roamed around in New Market but they chose different pockets of the busy shopping hub.
 
 One of their victims was robbed while hailing a taxi and another was targeted while waiting to cross JL Nehru Road. The Akhtars’ arrests also came after a dramatic planning. “Pickpocketing and even snatching is not unheard of in the New Market area but we were taken aback by the four back-to-back thefts. The incidents were reported near New Empire, Bertram Street, Corporation Place and  . After checking CCTV footages, when we realized that regular thieves were not involved, we introduced our men in plainclothes on the streets,” said an investigating officer from the New Alipore police station. “We ensured that the men’s wallets were visible from a distance. We nabbed the two women red-handed.”
 
 A search of their hotel room led to the recovery of several mobiles and money. “But neither their husbands nor their children were involved. We have informed the   about the incident,” the officer added.
 
 
 The police suspect the women could be part of a gang that had been behind a number of burglaries here recently.
