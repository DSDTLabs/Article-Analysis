LUCKNOW:   has decided to fill the gaps on the tracks laid on overbridges so that waste from washrooms of trains does not fall on people travelling on the streets below.

 There are seven railway overbridges in the city that are more than 50 years old. Daily commuters on KKC Road, Mawaiyya Road and the Old City have sent scores of complaints to the railways regarding waste falling on them from moving trains.
 
 “The work at KKC and Manaknagar bridges has been pending since the past 12 years.We'll start work at KKC within 15 days and complete it by December,“ said divisional railway manager (DRM), Lucknow division, Northern Railway, Satish Kumar.
 
 Commuters said they often wait for 15-20 minutes after the trains has passed to avoid the filth from falling on them from the open gaps. “I commute daily from Cantt to Husainganj around 10am. I wait for some time after the train has passed to avoid the waste. I get late for work if 2-3 trains pass on the route back-to-back,“ said Piyush Agarwal, a commuter near KKC underpass.
