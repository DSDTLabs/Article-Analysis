KOLKATA: Chief minister   gave 4,013 clubs a total of Rs 86.5 crore, spending from the state exchequer -Rs 2 lakh each to 4,000 clubs and Rs 50 lakh each to 13 premier clubs -at a programme in Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday.

 The dole to the clubs -for spending on promoting sports and games -was started immediately after Banerjee came to power in 2011. In July last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had, in its report, ticked off the clubs, saying they had spent only 34% of the grant on the purpose.
 
 Since 2011, a total of 12,653 clubs have been awarded Rs 2 lakh initially and then another Rs 3 lakh in three instalments, depending on the utilisation certificate (UC) provided by them. In the last seven years, the state has shelled out approximately Rs 360 crore under this scheme, aimed at developing sports and sporting infrastructure in Bengal.
 
 “Children are now busy with laptops, computers and phones,“ the CM said on Monday . “This is taking up their time for playing games. Games and sports help people become mentally strong and so the government, along with the clubs, inmtends to introduce games and sports in the aca demic curriculum. This will take time, but we are keen to develop the infrastructure.“
 
 After Trinamool swept into power, dislodging the more-than-three-decade-old Left Front government, the party identified 563 clubs and distributed Rs 11.26 crore among them.Then, another 137 clubs were identified for disbursal of Rs 2 crore; another 1,614 clubs received Rs 3 lakh each and 781 clubs got Rs 1 lakh each. The total figure comes to nearly Rs 40 crore.
 
 In 2013-'14, another 2,000 clubs were shown having received Rs 2 lakh each and 2,395 old clubs got Rs 1 lakh each, the amount totaling Rs 63 crore 95 lakh. In 2016, the government sanctioned another Rs 88.18 crore, where 2,000 new clubs were given a grant of 2 lakh each and another 5,194 old clubs were given one lakh each.
 
 CAG's report, however, indicates that in the period between 2011 and 2015, the   disbursed club grants worth Rs 176.90 crore to 6,006 clubs.The report said that it was neither mentioned on what basis the clubs were selected, nor was it assessed before the grants were disbursed whether the clubs were engaged in any sporting activity .
 
 The report claimed that records related to submission of the utilization certificates, along with the audited statement of accounts against the received grants, were not maintained properly . As a result, the number of clubs that received grants without submitting certificates of the previous instalments could not be determined. When asked about it, the council stated in October 2015 that there was a lack of skilled manpower to check such a huge number of certificates.
 
 On Monday , Banerjee again lashed out at demonetisation and said the move had adversely affected sports sponsorships, but added that the government would always stand by sportspersons. “We have built 16 new stadiums, refurbished 46 and built 23 youth hostels,“ she said. She said she will compose a theme song for the sports department, emphasising there was a need for one, since it would foster identity and a sense of pride.
 
 A number of sporting legends were honoures on the occasion. She conferred Khel Samman on 13 sportspersons, Banglar Gourab Samman on 15 and Krira Guru Samman on 5 coaches.   and Naresh Kumar were honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Atanu Das,  , Mouma Das and Debasree Majumder were honoured with `Bishesh Samman' and   was felicitated with `Ananya Samman'.
