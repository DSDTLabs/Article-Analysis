NEW DELHI: Senior   leader   on Monday clarified on Twitter that when he once called dreaded terrorist   'Osamaji' he was actually being sarcastic.

 He added that it was the   that "twisted" the comment to make it seem like he was "supporting him (Osama). 
 
 Bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York in 2001, was killed in May 2011 by US Special Forces at his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
 
 The Congress leader said he remembers his comments about Bin laden from a press conference in Varanasi at the time.
 
  
  
 
 After congratulating the US, Digvijaya said he sarcastically talked about how 'Osamaji' managed to stay so close to the Pakistan Military Academy without the Pakistani Army knowing about it.
 
 "Osamaji had been living in Pakistan for so many years, how is it possible that the Pakistani authorities could not locate him," is his quote from May 2011.
 
  
  
 
 Digvijaya added that he is "against all kinds of religious fanatics" no matter what their religion.
 
  
  
 
 The senior Congress leader was recently in the eye of a storm for posting an image on Twitter that contained decidedly unparliamentary language criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 Digvijaya's note on the tweet said he didn't create the meme, but he "couldn't help posting it". His note also said, in an apparent reference to PM Modi: "he is the best in the art of fooling!"
 
 The Congress politician is legendary for foot-in-mouth disease.
 Last year in August, while speaking to reporters, he referred to   as India-Occupied-Kashmir. This, at a time when tensions were at an all time high between the two neighbours, after security forces killed Kashmiri terrorist   on July 8.
