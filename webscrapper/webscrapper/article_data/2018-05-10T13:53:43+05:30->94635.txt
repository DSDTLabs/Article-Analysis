TIRUPUR: An 18-year-old migrant girl labourer from Andhra Pradesh was electrocuted while attempting to escape from the hostel of a private textile spinning mill by jumping its compound wall near Kangeyam here on Tuesday.

 According to police, M  , of   district in Andhra Pradesh, joined the private spinning mill at Kadaiyur on   road near Kangeyam as a helper more than a month ago. She was given accommodation at the mill’s hostel, along with more than 200 women labourers, said a police officer.
 
 When she didn’t turn up for the early morning shift on Tuesday, her roommates alerted the hostel warden. Hostel inmates launched a search for her and found her slippers near the compound wall.
 
 “Shravani was found   outside of the compound wall. She could have first climbed the gate to jump the 10ft high compound wall. But she could have lost balance when stepped on the sharp-edged glass pieces stuck on the wall and fell down. During the fall, she could have come into contact with the live electricity wire passing through close to the wall,” the police officer said.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that Shravani, a school dropout, had told her roommates that she did not like the work and she wanted to go home.
 
 But, as per the company’s norm, the inmates, especially young girls, would be allowed to go home only if their parents come to pick them up. “She had also told her roommates that her mother was likely to come to take her home. But, she might have tried to escape by jumping the mill compound wall and got electrocuted accidently,” the police said.
 
 The Kangeyam police have registered the case under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and further investigations are on.
