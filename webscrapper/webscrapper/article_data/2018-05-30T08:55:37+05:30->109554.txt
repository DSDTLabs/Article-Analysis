NAGPUR: The   (RPF), central railway, apart from extending security support to the railway authorities arranging for the safe passage of the affected passengers of air-conditioned two-tier A2 coach of   express at   station on Tuesday, also had a harrowing time to ensure they kept a strict vigil on their luggage. 

 
 
 
 During patrolling, the RPF personnel came across an eight-year-old unaccompanied minor with four mobile phones belonging to the passengers of the affected train. The mobile phones were later returned to their owners including a   (NSG) commando. The minor claimed to have found the devices on the platform lying unattended. 
 
 The minor was spotted by one of the patrolling squad of the RPF unit while moving around suspiciously. It was during questioning, the fact came to fore that he had four mobile phones in his possession. The mobile phones were picked up by the minor from different bogeys of the affected train and also from the platform. The minor was later reunited with his mother through a social worker.
