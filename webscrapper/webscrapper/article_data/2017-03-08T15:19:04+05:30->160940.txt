MADURAI: A contempt petition has been filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court seeking action against officials of the school education department for failing to comply with a October 3, 2016 court order directing to appoint chairman to the Tamil Nadu Private  .

 The petition, filed by B Karthee, came up for hearing before the division bench headed by Justice A Selvam on Tuesday. The bench was told that the government on Monday replaced D Sabitha with T Udhayachandran as school education secretary. Following it, the court directed the petitioner to implead proper officials to the case and adjourned the hearing to March 28. 
 
 The post of chairman to the Tamil Nadu Private   Determination Committee has been lying vacant since the fee committee’s former chairman justice S R Singaravelu demitted the office on December 2015. The state government had not taken steps to fill up the vacancy. 
 
 The petitioner had said that the committee was supposed to fix fees for schools in the state which has around 12,000 private nursery, primary, matriculation and Anglo Indian schools. Due to the absence of the chairman, many private schools were collecting excess fees from the students for the academic year 2016-17. Hence, it was necessary to fill the vacancy immediately, the petitioner’s side had prayed the division bench headed by former Chief Justice of the Madras high court Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who has now been elevated to the Supreme Court. 
 
 The government side told the court that the government was taking all the steps to fill the vacancy. However, due to the circumstances that were prevailing then (the former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had been hospitalized), the task was getting delayed, the government side said. 
 
 Following that, the bench gave the government a period of four weeks to complete the task of appointing the chairman. But, it did not do so. Hence, contempt petition was filed.
