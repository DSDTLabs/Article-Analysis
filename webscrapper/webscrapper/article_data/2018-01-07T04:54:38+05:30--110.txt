KALYAN: A 21-year-old call centre employee was rescued by police from a godown hours after he was kidnapped by four persons in connection with an assault case he had lodged three years ago. 

 The police said Karan Vishwakarma had filed a complaint against the brother of the kidnappers in 2015 for assaulting him and harassing his sister.
 
 The trial in the assault case was to commence and the accused wanted him to drop the charges, police said. The arrested accused are said to be attached to a political party. The accused were identified as brothers Girish and Chetan Pawse and their friends   and Mahendra Vayle.
 
 Karan Vishwakarma and his sister lived in Kalyan (east). Their parents had passed away a few years ago. Police said that in February 2015, Karan was assaulted by a third brother of the Pawse duo, Someshwar, and others when he protested with them for harassing his sister.
 
 Acting on Karan's complaint, the police had arrested Someshwar and his friends. The Pawses wanted Karan to withdraw case or turn hostile in court, but Karan refused to budge.
 
 On Saturday, Karan was passing by   when the motorcycle-borne accused accosted him and took him to a nearby shop where they assaulted him. He was then taken to an empty godown where the accused threatened to kill him if he refused to withdraw the case. A relative saw Karan being taken away and alerted   police, who immediately swung into action and raided the godown to arrest the accused.
