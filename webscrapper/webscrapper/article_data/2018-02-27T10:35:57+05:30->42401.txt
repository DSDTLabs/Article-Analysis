KOLHAPUR: With the temperature rising steadily, the supply of vegetables in the market has started declining. And this has started affecting their price in the retail market.

 Usually, during February and March, the supply of vegetables is stable as the air can hold moisture for a long time and it is suitable to store them for one to two days. In April, the supply starts dropping and two months later the prices soar by around 25% to 30%.
 
  
  
 Currently, the supply of cauliflower has been reduced from 336 bags (50kg each) to 325 bags. Similarly, tomato supply has come down to 1,300 crates from 1,500 crates in 10 days. The marginal reduction in supply has led to increase in prices. The tomatoes that now cost Rs 20 per kg in the retail market costed Rs 14 per kg 10 days ago.
 
 Mohan  , secretary of agriculture produce market committee, said, “Only a required amount of vegetables is being harvested by farmers every day. The supply is already coming down, the effects of which will be visible in next one week. Vegetables, being a perishable produce, gets easily spoiled during high temperature. Also, adequate care needs to be taken while transporting vegetables during summer. At the same time, the supply of some vegetables such as spinach increases these days as farmers cannot keep such produce in the farm for more days unlike brinjal (eggplant) or tomatoes.”
 
 The vegetable supply in retail markets comes from the nearby rural parts of the district. The sugarcane farmers tend to cultivate vegetables as inter-crop in their farms after sugarcane is cut and sent to the mills. Such vegetables are available in abundant during January and February.
  
 However, now the supply of vegetables grown as intercrop starts declining and the retail markets depend on vegetables supplied from the distant places that makes it costly owing to the transportation cost.
