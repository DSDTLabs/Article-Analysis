NEW DELHI: While the   were writing the accountancy   on Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tweeted that he had asked the directorate of education to look into the “complaints” of a   and report to  .

 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) later claimed that there was no paper   and someone tried to “disturb” the exam by spreading the rumour. But it has asked the centre superintendents to open sealed exam papers at 10am instead of 9.45am. The examinees are handed over question papers at 10.15am. 
 
 However, government officials said DoE had found that the images of the paper making rounds on WhatsApp were the same as Set II of the accountancy paper. Although CBSE vehemently denied the charge, government officials claimed that the paper had been accessed by outsiders by 9.49am, by when complaints were also made on the CBSE website. 
 
 According to a principal of a Delhi school, sealed papers are collected from nationalised banks and brought to the examination centres after which they are kept in lockers. Around 9.45am, the seal is broken by a school official in the presence of an external observer under the CCTV surveillance, and the papers are distributed among the invigilators according to their hall strength. The students are handed the paper by 10.15am, while the exam starts at 10.30am. 
 
 CBSE, in a statement, said the seals were intact at all exam centres. However, to narrow down the time window, the board sent a circular to its affiliate schools on Thursday asking them to open the sealed papers at 10am.
 
 Pulling up the centre superintendents for not strictly discharging their duties, CBSE’s controller of examination also reminded them that nobody except them — not even the invigilators — is supposed to carry electronic items such as mobile phones during the entire process. 
 
 Although the CBSE statement said that an FIR would be filed in the matter, no complaint has been made till late in the night.
