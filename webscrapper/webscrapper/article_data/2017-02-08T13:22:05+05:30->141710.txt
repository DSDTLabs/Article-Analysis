NAGPUR: Demonetisation has proved to be counterproductive and its effects will prevail for the next two to three years, said economist and politician Atul Londhe. He was expressing his views on the union   2017 at a programme organized at Shivaji Science College, Congress Nagar, on Tuesday.

 “Autonomy of the RBI was undermined for the first time in the history of India,” Londhe said. According to him, decisions pertaining to monetary policies since demonetisation were taken by revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia. On his part, RBI governor Urjit Patel did not come out with specific data to show the benefits of scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.
 
 Influx of cash into RBI’s kitty since November 8, 2016 can be viewed as a windfall for the central bank, according to Londhe. He said, “This liquidity will not be any good unless the demand in credit market increased.” Demonetisation has led to large scale unemployment, said Londhe. The Rs3.96 lakh crore allocation towards infrastructure development should prompt credit offtake by the private sector which, in turn, will create jobs, he added.
 
 Londhe was not much optimistic about the idea of universal basic income (UBI) which has been put on hold by union finance minister Arun Jaitley for now. 
 
 He supported the abolition of   (FIPB), albeit with a proviso.
