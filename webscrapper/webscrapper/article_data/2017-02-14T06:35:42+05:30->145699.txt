ALLAHABAD: The students’ unrest at   (AU), which had reached its peak with a student’s self-immolation bid on February 9, culminated on Sunday late night with a committee constituted by the vice-chancellor deciding to give offline option to students and constitution of new admission panel by dissolving the existing one. 

 It has also been decided that the university would speed up the process of appointment of permanent registrar and finance officer so that the posts may be filled in at the earliest. 
 
 Officiating registrar,  , said that in principle, the committee also agrees that books would be issued from the library to undergraduate students. However, recommendations might be sought from the librarian of the university, regarding requirement of infrastructure and manpower. 
 
 Meanwhile, on Monday, a group of agitating students allegedly compelled the registrar to sign his resignation letter. Later, police were called to disperse the students. 
 
 Shukla said, “The students compelled me to write that I am tendering my resignation. The notice has become viral, but I want to clarify that I have not resigned.” 
 
 He said, “Only after the appointment of new officer, will I tender my resignation to the VC.” 
 
 A group of students led by AU student union president   and Forum for Campus Democracy (FCD) had been agitating for the past several days on the issue of making admission process offline.
 
 On Februray 9, an agitating student,  , had attempted self-immolation in support of the demands.
