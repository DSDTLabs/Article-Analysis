HYDERABAD: The goodbyes were not done properly and the parting was hasty. " Five minutes hai mere pass (I have only five minutes)" actress   said as she exited the   house in Lonavala, Pune, on Wednesday. She took a flight and landed at   International Airport, Shamshabad, at night. On Thursday, dressed in black, she showed up at the excise office to be questioned by the   (SIT) in the drugs case. 

 There were tears and weeping at the Bigg Boss house. The other inmates, taken by surprise at her sudden departure, wanted to know why she was leaving. "Why are you packing?" they asked her. " Kya Hua (What happened)?" "What are you doing?" "Give us clarity?" were some of the questions she was bombarded with. 
 
 "Chalo Chalo, Bye Bye," Mumait   said as she ran towards the huge door of the Bigg Boss house and got out. "Play well. Be good. Be nice," she said, while rushing out of the house on Wednesday.
 
 Mumait Khan had to attend the questioning by excise officials, but she chose not to tell anyone that. However, even before the show began and inmates got into the house, word was out that her name had figured in the drugs case. The inmates probably were not aware of this.
 
  Organisers of Bigg Boss did not get back to a query from TOI about when she would return to the house.
