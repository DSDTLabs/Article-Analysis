HYDERABAD: In a major move to provide irrigation facility to the most backward areas of erstwhile   district,   on Monday laid the foundation stone for the   lift irrigation project and announced that the project will be completed in six months.

 Accompanied by ministers Jupally Krishna Rao, C Laxma Reddy, MP  , the irrigation minister unveiled the pylon and addressed a public meeting at Tumilla in   district. The project cost is pegged at Rs 783 crore and expected to revive the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) ayacut spread over 85,000 acres.
 
 Due to increased pressure on the Sriram Sagar project and reduced storage due to silt, the state government has decided to build the Tummilla lift project and two other lift projects to stabilize the previous ayacut. Though Sriramsagar was designed to have a storage capacity of 112 TMC, its capacity had come down to 80 TMC due to silting and sedimentation. The project was supposed to irrigate 9.73 lakh acres utilising 95 tmc of water, but the command area had come down along with water availability to only 54 TMC consequent to construction of different major irrigation projects including Babli dam in the upper reaches. “The allotment for RDS was 15.9 TMC which has come down to 5 TMC due to negligent attitude of the previous governments. Now, the TRS has decided to revive all irrigation sources in order to bring about Bangaru Telangana,” said   at the public meeting.
