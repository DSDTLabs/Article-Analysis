Residents say police presence in many parts of the city has been scanty which has come in handy for anti-social elements to indulge in crime. They want the police to make their presence felt in the smaller lanes and streets to deter the criminals. 

 Members of the public also feel that patrolling and vehicle checkup have been found wanting off late. The frequent vehicular checkup which used to take place in   has been missing in recent months. On the flip side, criminals have also been taking cover under the helmet too. “Police are not at all stopping those who are wearing helmets for verification. Sadly, most of the chain snatchers and robbers do wear a helmet to hide their identity. It also helps them from police scrutiny,” P Sangunathan, a residents association member, said. 
 
 Syed Ahamed Basha, a resident of Tahsildar Nagar, claims that local police know the offenders well but they hardly take any steps to rein them in. “The bushes in Yagappa Nagar and Vandiyur are a haven for anti-social elements here. But police hardly take any steps to ferret them out. Residents too refrain from making complaints in case of small thefts and robberies due to the fear of being targeted by the accused,”he said. 
 
 Police patrols have also not been making adequate rounds. “They do not reach the small lanes and dead ends where the anti-socials thrive. Police confine their patrolling to the main areas of a place. At many places girls do not feel safe to walk alone due to the presence of anti-socials who tease them. The law and order situation in Madurai needs to improve,” said R  , district secretary of CPM. 
 
 However, city police commissioner   said that they have 40 two-wheelers and 20 four-wheelers for patrolling and they were utilising them to their fullest.
