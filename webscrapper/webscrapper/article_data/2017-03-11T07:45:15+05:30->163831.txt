COIMBATORE: The   on Friday launched a five-day campaign to save waterbodies in the city and create awareness on the need to save water. State BJP vice-president   took out the rally after actor-turned-politician Napolean flagged it off near Velliangiri Hills.

 The rally covered areas such as Alandurai, Vadavalli, Kanuvai and Thudiyalur, and ended at   with a public meeting. Vanathi Srinivasan urged the state government to take up desilting of reservoirs.
 
 “The state government has done little to safeguard our waterbodies and its inaction is one of the main reasons for the drought the state faces. Nearly Rs20 crore is required for desilting dams and other waterbodies in the state. But the government hasn’t allotted funds. Dams such as Siruvani, Bhavanisagar and Aliyar need to be desilted ahead of the monsoon so that water could be saved. Also, structures should be set up in all houses and other locations in the city to harvest rain water,” she said.
 
 Napoleon said nearly eight lakes in Coimbatore had not been desilted or cleaned for several decades. “There are several encroachments and they need to be removed. Government buildings such as bus stands are set up on the banks of lakes such as Valankulam. The district administration or the government has done little to remove them. The waterbodies and the canals are filled with garbage, hindering water flow during the rain,” he said.
 
 On Saturday, the rally would begin from   and end at   near Pollachi, and on Sunday, it will start from   and end at Periyanaickenpalayam. On Monday, the rally will begin at Sencheri Malai and end at Mettupalayam, and on Tuesday, it will begin at Poo Market and end near Town Hall.
