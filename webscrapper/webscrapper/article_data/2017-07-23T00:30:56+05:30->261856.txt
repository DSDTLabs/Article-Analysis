NAVI MUMBAI: If all goes as planned, Navi Mumbai will soon get two AC passenger   services to south Mumbai, which will ply from Vashi and Belapur to Gateway to India and  . There are also plans to use a third, under-construction fishing jetty near Vashi’s Wockhardt Hospital for the purpose. 

 On Saturday, NMMC additional commissioner Ankush Chavan told TOI: “We have got an NOC from the Maharashtra Maritime Board for an inland waterways operation from Vashi and Belapur. We plan to issue a tender in the coming week to appoint a consultant to conduct an economic feasibility report for the project. We may also consider operating the service or select a partner on a revenue-sharing basis, but it all depends on the report.” 
 
 The ticket cost will be worked out later. 
 
 Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s transport wing, has been tasked with floating the tender as it is responsible for both road and waterways transport. The Navi Mumbai civic body has kept aside Rs 10 crore of its budgetary allocation for the project. 
 
 Chavan said the objective is to decongest roads and reduce vehicular pollution. 
 
 In the mid-1990s, Navi Mumbai had a hovercraft service from Sagar Vihar jetty to south Mumbai. Currently, there is a boat service that runs between Uran and south Mumbai. There is also a private service to Elephanta Caves.
 
 The feasibility report will look at profitability and passenger count as NMMC faces competition from Cidco, which has lined up a bigger passenger terminus project at Nerul. The Cidco   is likely to have space for transporting vehicles too.
