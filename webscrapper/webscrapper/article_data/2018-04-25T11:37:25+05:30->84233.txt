THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   on Tuesday slammed   ( ) chairman P Mohana Das over the latter's remarks regarding Varapuzha death. Das had said that the case should be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). 

 "The rights panel chief should do the task assigned to him. He shouldn't make statements based on his past political stand," Vijayan said during a news conference. While referring to the social media-triggered hartal held in the state last week, the CM said those who had the similar mind set of the commission were behind the hartal.
 
 He said the government would never approve of third degree torture methods by police. "Four policemen are already arrested in Varapuzha case. The probe is progressing. If anyone else is found to be guilty, they will also be booked. Similar incidents happened in the past too. It may be for the first time that the action against that action against the culprits was so prompt," the CM said adding that the police generally behaved well with the public.
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala came out in defence of Das. " It is only an attempt to cover up his failure in reining in the police force. The commission is discharging its duty to protect the rights of people," Chennithala said here.
 
 The CM also denied allegations levelled by friends of Ileza, sister of Latvian tourist Liga who was found dead in the state capital, that he and the DGP were rude to them.
