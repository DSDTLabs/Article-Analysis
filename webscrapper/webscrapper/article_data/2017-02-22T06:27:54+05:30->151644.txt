KOLKATA/JALPAIGURI: CID sleuths probing the baby trafficking racket   has found the involvement of a senior government official and four doctors. An officer said they would question the district child protection officer   in this regard. Her husband is also under scanner.

 District magistrate of Jalpaiguri, Rachna Bhagat, has meanwhile issued a show-cause notice to Ghosh. “The notice was issued late on Monday night,“ Bhagat said. “Seventeen kids went missing and it's hard to believe that the district child protection officer was completely unaware,“ the DM said. When asked, Ghosh said, “I have not received any such letter from the district magistrate. In case I get such a notice, I will give them a proper reply.“
 
 Sources said disproportionate assets were accumulated by a couple of the suspects in the past few years that might be linked to profits made through this gang.CID officers took both the accused -Chandana Chakraborty and Sonali Mondal -to Siliguri.It is not clear if they will be brought to Kolkata for questioning.
 
 CID officials said they also have in their possession a fivepage note by   (CARA) that has detailed the irregularities carried out by Chakraborty, chairperson of an NGO.
 
 Sources said   general secretary Juhi Chakraborty and Chandana were accompanied by a third person during their North Block meeting with a central minister.
