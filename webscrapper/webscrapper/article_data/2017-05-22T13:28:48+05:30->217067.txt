 "Niall came over to me and said you'll never guess who's got a crush on you - Cheryl. I was saying something about Cheryl in Simon's house and he said I know who the future Mrs Payne is. "
 
 "Apparently he really embarrassed her one day by saying do you know who really really fancies you and she left the room bright red and Niall told me this whole story. They played Cupid. They are your boys," Payne said.
