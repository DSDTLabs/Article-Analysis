PANAJI: Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM) has condemned the demand of town and coutnry planning miniser   over extending the time for playing loud music for beach weddings and other parties till mid night in Goa.

  “Sardesai should remember that Goa should remain primarily a peaceful home for ‘Goenkars’ and not a place where they suffer sleepless nights,” said Anand Shirodkar, president, GSM, in a press release.   has reportedly raised this demand at a meeting of National Democratic Alliance in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 “Tourists come to enjoy Goa’s natural beauty. Former CM Laxmikant Parsekar did not allow Sunburn and other EDM festivals in Goa in 2016. The tourist inflow has only increased by 20% in 2016 as compared to that of 2015,” said Shirodkar.
