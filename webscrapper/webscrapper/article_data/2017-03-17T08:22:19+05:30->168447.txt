NEW DELHI: To woo municipal voters in unauthorised colonies,   has promised to put an end to the sealing and demolition of illegal constructions. Eyeing a third successive term in the three corporations, the party said it would grant “legal status” to lakhs of houses in the city’s many unauthorised colonies.

 “We don’t want people living in the fear of their houses being sealed or demolished by civic agencies,” Delhi BJP chief   declared on Thursday. Within three months of returning to power, “we will draft rules to allow people to obtain legal sanction for their buildings by paying a fee”, Tiwari said. The North-East Delhi MP, whose constituency has the most unauthorised colonies in the capital, said that in undertaking this, restrictions regarding building height and ground coverage would be worked out. He added that he had discussed the matter with Union urban development minister.
 
 BJP said that such a move would help the cash-strapped corporations increase revenue because in getting paid sanction for their houses, the house owners would be drawn into the property tax net. “At present, these house owners pay bribes to protect their property from sealing and demolition. Why should they suffer?” said Tiwari. Property tax is one of the main sources of revenue for the corporations, but the east and north corporations have been unable to substantially raise revenues due to many of the colonies under their jurisdiction being unauthorised.
 
 Tiwari said that the central government was already in the process of regularising these colonies after both the central and state governments extended the cut-off date for eligibility for regularisation to January 1, 2015. BJP hopes this announcement will help wean supporters of AAP to its side. “AAP won the 2015 elections with the support of unauthorised colonies, but has not fulfilled its commitment to regularise these colonies,” said a BJP leader.
