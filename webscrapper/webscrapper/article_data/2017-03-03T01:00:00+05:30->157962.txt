The rhythmic taal of the tabla, the melancholic resonance of the sarangi, the rich javari of the sitar… all these magical sounds amalgamated into a beautiful musical tribute at   Theatre’s 33rd   this week. Like every year, this time too, tabla maestro Ustad   performed in honour of   doyenne, the late Jennifer Kapoor, wife of Shashi Kapoor. 
The venue was jam-packed with music aficionados, who had come to watch the master of percussion in all his glory. The evening brought alive the ‘baithak’ experience, and the concert was a classical performance that was heavily influenced by jazz. So on one hand,   captured the essence of classical ragas through his sitar, while Israeli trumpeter Avishai Cohen added a flavour of jazz. Also on stage were musicians Louiz Banks (grand piano), Abhinav Khokhar (acoustic bass), Sabir Khan (sarangi) and Sanjay Divecha (guitar). The musicians not just jammed together, but also improvised on stage and indulged in friendly banter, much to the delight of audience. 
 The musical night, which was hosted by Kunal Kapoor, saw Bollywood as well as theatre personalities in attendance. Among those spotted include Makarand Deshpande, Rajit Kapur, Ila Arun, Dolly Thakore, Feroz Abbas Khan, Shaad Ali, Ashish Vidyarthi and Rakesh Bedi. We also saw Neila Devi (wife of late Shammi Kapoor) catching up with Shashiji at the cafe.
