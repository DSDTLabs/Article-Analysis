HYDERABAD: One of the biggest bio-incubator facility in Hyderabad with 20,000 square feet built-up area, was inaugurated on Wednesday at  , on the occasion of National Science Day.

 The facility named as ‘Bioincubator Nurturing Entrepreneurship for Scaling Technologies’ (BioNEST) is supported by   (BIRAC), a unit of Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi.
 
 
  
 
 Speaking on the occasion, G Padmanaban, Padma awardee and former director, Indian Institute of Science, who inaugurated the facility said, “I have seen five such facilities in the country but this Bio-NEST facility is the best among them.”
 
 He further added, “Incubators are required in all government institutions for startups to commence their work. I have gone through 5,000 research proposals and out of that 700 are operational in 500 industries.”
 
 These startups have developed 100 products out of which 50 have been commercialized. “Such is the scope of research and I call upon government institutions which are having 1,000 laboratories to start such incubation facilities that can have start-ups capable of aligning with the research happening in the institution,” Padmanaban said.
 
 Varsity officials said that selection procedure for the startups to join the incubator will be very stringent, adding how the incubator will eventually be one of the best in the world.
 
 “It’s like a dream come true for the   and the University of Hyderabad,” said Appa Rao Podile, vice-chancellor, UoH. “The selection procedure will be stringent for the incubatees and we are confident that we will have good start-ups at our facility.”
 
 “The 20,000 plus sq.ft facility can accommodate 30 startups and provide 16 benches for research. Also, 350 PhD scholars, faculties are available in the School of Life Sciences who can help in collaborations and consulting for the start-ups,” said P Reddanna, faculty in the  , who also the Principal Investigator for Bio-NEST.Biggest bio-incubator facility opens at UoH
