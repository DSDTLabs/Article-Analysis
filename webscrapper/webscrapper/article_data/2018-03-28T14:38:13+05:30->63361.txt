SURAT: Many new members attending their first senate meeting at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) used unparliamentary language on Tuesday. Majority of them were either members of   ( ) or government nominees.

 Kanu Algotar alias Bharwad, elected member from Arts faculty, threatened head of the department of rural studies Vipul   of dire consequences for not making clarifications to his questions. Somani said Narmada College of Social Work was being run in violation of university norms and that forms of students were being filled by clerks during discussion on annual report. 
 
 Somani alleged, “Only by filing form and submitting fees, a student can get degree. This college has been allowed to operate by the university after collecting a fine of Rs 5 lakh.” Before Somani could complete his speech, Bharwad started demanding other details of the college. Somani said he would reply to any question raised by the chairman of the meeting and this offended Bharwad, who threatened him. 
 
 Gaurang Vaidya rushed to Bharwad and told him to keep quiet. He explained to him that Somani was raising an issue that had occurred during the term of the previous vice-chancellor. 
 
 Similarly,   tried to intervene when head of the department of English Rakesh Desai was making his concluding remarks on the annual report. Desai, chairman of the committee that had prepared the report, also said he will respond to any questions from the chairman of the meeting only.
 
 Many members continued to make comments such as ‘koni gol lagavo’, ‘gai khai gai’ and ‘sab bhumi Gopalki’ when others were participating in the discussion.
