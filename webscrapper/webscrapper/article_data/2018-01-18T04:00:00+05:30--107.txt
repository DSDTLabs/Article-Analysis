Rajkot: A huge fire broke out in the forest area near Katar village close to Rajula town of Amreli district on Wednesday.

 Sources said that there are nearly 15 Asiatic lions visible in this region. Forest department sources, however, said there is no threat to the lions as all the animals escaped to safer locations on seeing the flames and smoke.
 
 According to locals, the fire might have been sparked by the ‘bidi’ of some shepherd who had taken animals for grazing in the forest area. Besides lions, there are around 200 nilgais in the area. 
 
 Firefighters from Rajula municipality were rushed to douse the fire, which had spread to around 22 bighas land. The local mamlatdar and police also rushed to the spot to oversee the operations.
