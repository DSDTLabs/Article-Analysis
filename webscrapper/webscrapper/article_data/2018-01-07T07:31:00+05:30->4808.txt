LUDHIANA: The   has been crippled with 30 out of 120 buses lying non-functional. These include buses plying on busy routes such as Haibowal, Shimlapuri, Ferozepur, Ram Nagar and  .

 “A total of 30 out of 120 buses are not working due to some mechanical problem. This is usual. We are trying our best to bring these buses on the roads,” said   commissioner  , who acknowledged the inconvenience being faced by people. 
 
 “I don’t have a car and have to travel by bus frequently. But since these buses do not operate on every route, there are many problems. It is possible to go to nearby areas on auto but areas like Shimlapuri, which are comparatively far off, do not have a bus service. The government should implement the bus service properly,” said  , a city resident.
 
 “They suddenly stop services on various routes without prior information, creating major problems. I have stopped traveling on city buses now,” said Jasbir Kaur, a resident of Dugri.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Baljit Singh, general manager, City Bus service said, “We do receive complaints. But the operator isn’t ready as they say these routes are not profitable. In November, we submitted an expression of interest to the   to introduce E-buses and E-tax under the   project. It will take 2 to 2.5 months. Once we procure the e-buses, we will start the service.”
