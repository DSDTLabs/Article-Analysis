CHANDIGARH: Clarifying that no team of government officials had been sent to Delhi to plead for the release of cash credit limit (CCL) by RBI, the Punjab government claimed that the central bank had already cleared the payment, which was expected to reach the state’s coffers latest by Wednesday.

 Following chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s meeting and subsequent telephonic conversations with Union finance minister  , the CCL issue had been resolved with the central government, which had directed RBI to release the payment, a government spokesperson said here on Tuesday.
 
 He said the CM had spoken to Jaitley three times on the issue and there was no pending concern in the matter. The state government had simply sent its team to complete the formalities expeditiously, he said, adding that there was no question of pleading with the RBI in this regard.
 
 The RBI holidays on April 1 and 2, had caused a slight delay but the funds were expected to come in any moment now, said the spokesperson. He rejected media reports suggesting that there were obstacles in the release of the payment.
 
 “The state government has made all possible arrangements to ensure smooth and   procurement in the mandis. The CM has already directed all DCs to personally monitor the procurement process and arrangements have been made on war-footing to streamline the process in all the 1,800 grain markets of Punjab,” he said.
 
 The state mandi board had been directed to provide all basic amenities and facilities in the mandis, in addition to smooth and timely payments, as well as complete transparency in the process, which the new government had decentralized to make it more structured and effective, the spokesperson said.
