LUCKNOW: The RDSO (Research Designs and  ) has finally issued the oscillation trial test results of Lucknow Metro. It has approved maximum 90 kmph   in both loaded and unloaded condition of train. It will issue final speed   to Lucknow   only at 10% less than approved speed, that is at 80 kmph in both loaded and unloaded conditions. 

 But in case of deflated suspension (when air leaks), the maximum approved speed is only 60 kmph. An RDSO official said, “The deflated condition is rare but if at all it happens, the train can move only at a maximum speed of 60 kmph. If it goes beyond, it will cause problems to train and passengers like fatigue, discomfort, etc.”
 
 RDSO team has sent report to   directorate for approval issuance of ‘Final Speed Certificate.’ An official said, “The certificate will be issued only after looking into the emergency braking distance report, which is under preparation and shall be furnished within next four days.”
