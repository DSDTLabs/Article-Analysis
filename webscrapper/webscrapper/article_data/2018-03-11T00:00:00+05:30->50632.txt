Seems like more and more filmmakers from   are foraying into web series. After a few of them received a good response from netizens and movie buffs alike, the prominent among them being Balaji Mohan’s As I’m Suffering From  , here comes another director. Guhan Senniappan of   fame will be helming a yet-to-be-titled series, which will be bankrolled by SR  . “The genre of the series will be dark humour — which was also one of the prime elements of my debut film Sawaari. Web series is a platform, which is being experimented by many today, and hence, I took the plunge,” says Guhan.

 SR Prabhu says, “The shooting will start this month, in Chennai. Bobby   and   Nair have been roped in to play the lead roles in it.” Music director Vishal Chandrasekhar, who had teamed up earlier with Guhan, will compose music for the project. The musician avers that it offers lot of scope to explore some new-age, stylish and cutting-edge music. “I’m currently going through the script and am thinking of the requirements. I think the music for the project will be such that it will break the barriers, but at the same time, it will have to be in sync with the genre.”
