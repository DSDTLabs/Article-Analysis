HYDERABAD: The family of slain terrorist Mohammed  , who was gunned down by security forces in Kashmir, does not want to claim his body. This was confirmed by Taufeeq’s father while talking to TOI on Friday. A top police official of Jammu and Kashmir, also told TOI, “Nobody from the family in   has come to claim the body. We did contact them.”

 Taufeeq’s father Mohammed Razak, a technician working with the Department of Atomic Energy’s Heavy Water Plant in Manugur of   district, however, said: “We have not received any communication from the Jammu and Kashmir government, but we don’t want to claim Taufeeq’s body. It is not necessary. He didn’t die for the country. He just went astray.” Razak did not elaborate on his decision.
 
 Police in Bhadradri Kothagudem said there was no missing complaint lodged by Taufeeq’s family, though he left home around a year ago. “We are yet to speak to his family. But we are surprised they did not lodge a missing complaint,” police said.
 
 Taufeeq created a FB account through which he would communicate with Kashmiri separatists before he got access to terror operatives. He switched over to   after working with another militant group.
 
 The pleasure trip to Kashmir in 2012 with family proved to be the turning point in his life. He toured places with his family availing his father’s LTA. After returning, he inquired about violence in the valley and followed the subject on social media. “When his father came to know about his son’s interest, he rebuked him. But Taufeeq continued to follow militancy-related developments,” a cop said.
