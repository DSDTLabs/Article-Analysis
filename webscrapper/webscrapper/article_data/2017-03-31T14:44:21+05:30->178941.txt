NEW DELHI: As the tenth season of the   gets underway on April 5, here's a look at five overseas cricketers who could prove superb picks for the new franchises. 
 
 
 
 
 At the player auction in February, Kagiso Rabada and Pat Cummins made headlines while Angelo Mathews returned to Delhi Daredevils for his base price of Rs 2 crore, but it is the signing of the New Zealand allrounder for Rs 1 crore which could prove the most impactful for the franchise. With the South African pair of Quinton de Kock and JP Duminy ruled out the season, Anderson now slots in as a first-choice pick given his all-round skill. The 26-year-old has a T20 batting strike-rate of 137.53 and a bowling strike-rate of 23.5, has big innings to his credit - sample his 41-ball 94 against Bangladesh in January - and has proven a useful partnership-breaker with his pace. After a lukewarm run for Mumbai Indians earlier, could this be Anderson's breakout IPL season? 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 During last year's World Twenty20 held in India, Rashid was second in the overall wickets tally with 11, and this year has taken 41 wickets in 17 ODIs and T20Is combined. In January, during the Desert T20 Challenge which Afghanistan won, Rashid took six wickets in four matches with a best of 2/12 versus UAE, and then a further 10 against Zimbabwe as Afghanistan won an ODI series 3-2. Most recently against Ireland at Afghanistan's adopted home in Greater Noida, the 18-year-old legspinner proved a major irritant for Ireland with 24 wickets from three T20Is and five ODIs. Afghanistan swept the T20Is 3-0, with Rashid scalping an incredible 5/3 in the second match, and the ODIs 3-2. During the second ODI, which Afghanistan won by 34 runs, Rashid claimed the best figures by an Afghanistan bowler in the format - 6/43. This was followed by eight wickets against Ireland in an innings-and-72-run win in Greater Noida during the ICC Intercontinental Cup. The defending champions lack a quality overseas spinner, but how to fit Rashid in remains the tough part. Sunrisers have plenty of pace-bowling options, of which, foreseeably, Australian Ben Cutting would be the one to vie for a spot with Rashid as an allrounder in the XI. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Perhaps unfamiliar to the Indian audience a year ago, this attacking England opener now needs no introduction. During last year's ICC World Twenty20 held in India, Roy hit 183 runs at a strike-rate of 148.78 and played two destructive innings: the first, 43 off 16 balls to kick-start England's record chase against South Africa, and the second 78 off 44 balls to hasten a chase of 154 over New Zealand in the semi-final. In January, Roy had scores of 73, 82, 65 in three successive ODIs against India followed by 19, 10 and 32 in the T20I series and most recently 17, 52 and 13 in the West Indies. With a career T20 strike-rate of 144.49, and four centuries, the 26-year-old is capable of delivering Gujarat Lions some power-packed starts in the presence of Brendon McCullum. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 A West Indian for a West Indian? As far as Kolkata Knight Riders are concerned, the 23-year-old is the best replacement for Andra Russell, who won't feature this season as he serves a one-year suspension. "Rovman Powell is a Jr Andre Russell" read a tweet from the franchise's handle earlier this year, on the exciting allrounder who plays for KKR's sister franchise in the Caribbean Premier League, Trinbago Knight Riders. One of two uncapped overseas players picked at February's auction, helping his case were fine all-round performances in the semi-finals and final of the Caribbean Super 50 - 95 off 45 balls and 5/36 in the 2/27 and 65 off 59 balls, two days before the IPL auction. While Rovman's career T20 stats do not make for anything special (233 runs and two wickets in 14 games), KKR captain Gautam Gambhir feels the youngster could be the big thing in  . 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 It looks, on paper and this year's red-ball form, that Kings XI Punjab have a bargain deal. Guptill's first innings of 2017 was 112 off 95 balls for Auckland versus Central Districts in the Ford Trophy, New Zealand's domestic List A tournament. Next, an ODI against Australia, 61 off 73 balls. But then â€¦ ah, something ridiculously special. Out of the Black Caps' first three home ODIs against South Africa with a hamstring issue, Guptill walked back in to open the innings and smashed an unbeaten 180 in the must-win fourth game to keep the hosts alive and force a decider. That innings contained 15 fours and 11 sixes, and drew comparisons to Guptill's double-century during the 2015 World Cup. Fitting Guptill into a line-up whose first-choice overseas picks will be David Miller, Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh and Marcus Stoinis will be difficult, but it he's one of your back-up options you've done pretty well.
