NAGPUR: Riding the development wave, BJP recorded a landslide victory in   polls. It won as many as 48 seats out of 80, in what was predicted as a tough contest between the saffron party, BRP-BMS, Congress and Shiv Sena. In 2012 polls, BJP won only 18 seats and had formed the local government in association with its saffron partner   and some independents.

 The BJPâ€™s wave in the city was evident from the fact that it won 30 more seats based on its performance of two and half years at the helm of affairs. Prior to them their strong rival BRP-BMS were ruling. Analysts says it was due to lot of development works carried out by the BJP-Sena combine that reaped the benefits for the former.
 
 It was predicted that BRP-BMS of Prakash Ambedkar would give tough fight to the BJP, but it turned out to be a one sided fight with Congress bagging the second position with 13 seats. The BRP-BMS was relegated to the distant third with just three seats. Even the Sena managed to bag eight seats while   secured five. Two independents under the banner of Sambhaji Brigade won two seats.   fielded about 14 candidates considering the fact that Akola has large number of Muslim population, but it has to contend with just one.
 
 Sena strongman Gulabrao Gawande, who had switched over to the other side, failed to boost the Congress hopes. Interestingly, out of eight couples who contested polls, three merged victories. It included two candidates from BJP and one from Sena. Two mother-daughter contestants faced defeats.
