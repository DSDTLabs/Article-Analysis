LUDHIANA: The   party on Thursday staged a massive protest against the Union government on the issue of rising fuel prices in the country. Led by District Congress president Gurpreet Gogi, MP Ravneet Bittu, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, and all MLAs and senior leaders of Congress gathered outside the office of deputy commissioner. After shouting slogans against the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the protestors gave a memorandum to deputy commissioner Pradeep Aggarwal.

 Addressing Congress workers, both Bittu and Gogi said if BJP failed to put a stop to incessant price rise of petrol and diesel, none of their ministers would be allowed to enter Punjab, and he will be opposed by showing black flags.
 
 According to Gogi: “The rise in prices of fuel is impacting everyone, whether a common man, farmer, or a businessman. All promises made by PM Modi before coming to power have turned out to be a bundle of lies, and both Modi and BJP are nothing less than sweet poison who are killing our people and the nation slowly. The citizens of the country are fed up of these liars, and their bluff has been called off. They will be uprooted from power next year.”
 
 Other prominent leaders present on the occasion included Surinder Dawar, Kuldeep Singh Vaid, Sanjay Talwar, Satwinder Bitti, Kamaljit Singh Karwal, and Sushil Prashar.
