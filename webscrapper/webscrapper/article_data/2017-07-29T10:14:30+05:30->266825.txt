Madalyn  , a web developer from a US based tech firm, took to   recently to share what happened when she was upfront with her colleagues about taking sick leave for her  .

 Nearly 10,000 people have retweeted her latest tweet, and many are responding with their own stories -both positive and negative.
 
 The tweet has received a lot of attention in particular because of the way the CEO of her firm, Olark Live Chat, responded. The email was titled "Where's Madalyn," and in the body Parker wrote: "I'm taking today and tomorrow to focus on my mental health. Hopefully I'll be back next week refreshed and back to 100%." CEO   got back to her in the best way possible.
 
 "I just wanted to personally thank you for sending emails like this," he wrote."Every time you do, I use it as a reminder of the importance of using sick days for mental health -I can't believe this is not standard practice at all organisations.You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can bring our whole selves to work."
 
 Parker has written about her mental health and working before. She says she is comfortable with talking about it now, but the idea used to terrify her. In a blog post, Congleton explained how surprised he was at the reaction to his response, and how in 2017 this response really should be the norm.
 
 "Even in the safest environment it is still uncommon to be direct with your coworkers about mental health issues," he wrote. "I wanted to...express gratitude for Mada lyn's bravery in helping us normalise mental health as a normal health issue."
 
 In 2003, a study by the   found that up to five million people feel extremely stressed at work, and around a million people were so stressed that they believed their job was making them ill.
 
 "When an athlete is hurt they sit on the bench and re cover," wrote Congleton, "Let's get rid of the idea that somehow the brain is differ ent."
