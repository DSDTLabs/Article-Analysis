KOTTAYAM: A four-day-old boy was abducted from the district hospital in   in Pathanamthitta on Thursday. Anitha, the baby's mother, was in the labour room when the incident occurred. Anitha's mother gave the baby to Saji, Anitha's husband and had gone outside for a while. 

 While Saji was waiting outside the labour room with the baby, a woman, seemingly in her thirties, approached him and took the baby from him in the pretext of carrying it to its mother inside the labour room. Saji had got acquainted with the woman earlier after she introduced herself as the bystander of another patient. He realized his baby was stolen when the nurse came and asked for the baby. After the hospital authorities informed the police, police arrived at the hospital and examined the   footages. A woman in churidar was seen walking out of the hospital with the baby and getting into an autorickshaw. 
 
 Soon, all the police stations in the region were alerted. Though the police received information about a woman walking along the road with a baby in Kulasekharapetta the cops who went to the area were unable to track her down. 
 
 Saji and Anitha were from Kavummoola, Madathumpady in Ranni. The couple have a four-year-old daughter.
