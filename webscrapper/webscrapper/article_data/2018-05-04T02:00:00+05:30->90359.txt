PATNA: The   restoration work is likely to be over by September this year.

 The British-age building located on the Gandhi Maidan-Kurji Mor road in Patna is a state-protected monument, but its restoration work was assigned to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 2011 owing to its expertise in restoration of archaeological structures. 
 
 The renovation project was initially estimated to involve a cost of Rs 96 lakh. “We started work on the project in 2011 and finished 90% of the job in seven years. To complete the work, we required an additional amount of Rs 10 lakh, but the state government took almost a year — from February 2017 to March 2018 — to release the amount,” ASI’s Patna circle superintending archaeologist D N Sinha told this reporter on Wednesday.
 
 The funds were released a fortnight back by the State Archaeological Directorate, and the work will be resumed in another 15 days.
 
 “The pending work includes exterior plastering (to some extent), refurbishment of the staircases and the installation of lighting conductors atop the 96ft high monument,” Sinha said and added the restoration work would wound up in three-four months after which the state government might open the premises for visitors.
 
 Built in the year 1776 under the supervision of Capt John Garstin of the British army following the famine of 1770, the heritage granary has a height of 29m with 3.6m thick walls and 145 steps of spiral stairway built around it.
 
 The restoration of Golghar was necessitated after its wall was spotted to have developed a vertical crack near the staircase in 2010. 
 
 ASI sources said the restoration work was quite risky. “There was no light inside the monument and the oxygen level at the top was very poor,” an official said and added labourers had to be provided special uniforms that consisted of oxygen mask, light holders and helmets.
