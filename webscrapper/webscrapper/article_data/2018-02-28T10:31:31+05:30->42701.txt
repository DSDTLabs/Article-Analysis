MADURAI: A 14-year-old schoolgirl from a village near  , who was set on fire by a spurned man, died of burn injuries in the early hours of Tuesday after battling for life for 11 days at Government Rajaji Hospital. 

 M Chithra Devi, who hailed from   village, was studying in class IX in a government school in nearby Achampatti village. The accused, T  ,22, hailing from the same village, intercepted the girl while she was returning home from school on February 16. He doused her with petrol and set her afire even as her mother M Pechiammal, who was passing by the spot in an autorickshaw, watched the incident helplessly. She along with the auto driver put out the fire and rushed her to hospital. The accused ran away from the spot leaving his bike behind. Balamurugan, a distant relative of Devi, had been harassing her and her family members demanding that she marry him. He was working as a daily wage labourer in a private mill in   village. As they refused, he decided to murder her.
 
 Tension prevailed at the hospital where the girlâ€™s relatives had gathered since morning. They resorted to a road block putting forth various demands including Rs 10 lakh compensation from the government.
