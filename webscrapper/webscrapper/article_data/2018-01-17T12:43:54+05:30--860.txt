KOCHI: Fungal skin infection is the main concern for skin specialists in the state now.

 “Fungal skin diseases are on a rise and it is imported to   from  . We conducted around 50 camps at places where migrant labourers stay and found that many had fungal skin infection. They pass it on to others,” said  , organizing committee chairman, of the 46th National conference of Indian Association of Dermatologists,   and  .
 
 They are organizing the national conference ‘DERMACON 2018’ from January 18 to 21. International and national experts are expected to attend the conference where they will discuss the main concerns for dermatologists, venereologists and leprologists.
 
 Fungal infections are common in humans and are usually not very serious if they are treated quickly and correctly. Anyone with a weakened immune system may be more likely to contract a fungal infection. Most fungal skin infections can be treated with over-the-counter or prescription creams. Severe infections may require additional methods.
 
 However, the problem is that often the patients go to the doctors late and the health sector has yet to take a serious note of the problem. “If it affects the superficial part of the skin, then it is a treatable condition. But the problem is that majority of patients approach a dermatologist when the whole body is covered with fungal infection,” said Dr Kuriyipe.
 
 Fungal infections are described as opportunistic or primary. Infections that affect many areas of the body are known as systemic infections, while those that affect only one area are known as localized.
 
 “Our humid conditions aggravate the problem. Hygiene is also very important,” added consultant dermatologist and laser surgeon Dr M M Faizal.
