GHAZIABAD: The   is likely to implement a policy where it will be compulsory for group housing societies in the city to install any kind of   device within their premises in order to procure completion certificates. 

 Following a meeting with various stakeholders, including local residents, GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Maheshwari said on Wednesday that the proposal for this policy has been sent to various departments for ratification.
 
 The broad objective behind formulating this policy is to ensure that there is minimal level of segregation of solid waste that is generated in large quantities in residential societies. The policy also aims to ensure that residential societies take to composting within their own premises for purposes of gardening and landscaping.
 
 “It will be made mandatory for all group housing societies that are yet to procure completion certificates from GDA. It will be equally applicable for projects that are already constructed or those on which construction work is under way,” Maheshwari told TOI.
 
 In the past, highrises in   and other areas of Ghaziabad have attempted at solid waste management within their premises from time to time but without much success. The   apartments in   2 had hired a Greater Noida-based private agency in 2017 to make its premises a ‘zero-waste society’. As per the plan, dry waste and wet waste were to be segregated at doorsteps before transporting it to the firm’s plant in Greater Noida. However, the mission failed because of issues with transportation.
 
 The GDA is, however, mulling to provide technical knowhow for solid waste management devices to housing societies.
 
 “We have more than a couple of models to effectively deal with household garbage that were on display in a recently held municipal solid waste management exhibition. Any of these models can be made applicable for managing municipal solid waste in the societies,” said Maheshwari.
