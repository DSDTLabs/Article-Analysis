AHMEDABAD: A resident of the   has sued his daughter-in-law for Rs 10 lakh and sought criminal action against her, for falsely implicating him in a domestic violence complaint.

  filed a   complaint against his daughter-in-law Lubna before a metropolitan court on Tuesday. This came after Lubna’s complaint under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act was rejected by a court of law on December 2, 2016.
 
 Pathan sought action against his daughter-in-law for her false accusations of him trying to kill her and mental and physical torture. He claimed that by misusing DV laws, she defamed him and his family which led to him being ostracised in his community. He and members of his family could not attend a social function because of the defamation.
 
 Pathan pegged the loss of his reputation at Rs 9.5 lakh, which he urged the court to make Lubna compensate. This is besides his demand for the Rs 50,000 he spent on the four-year long litigation. Metropolitan Court No. 5 scheduled verification of the complaint for February 18, Pathan’s advocate   said.
 
 In this case, Lubna Vohra, a resident of Shahibaug, married Pathan’s son Firoz’s in 2009. As their matrimonial disputes grew, her husband left the country and never returned. She filed a complaint before Metropolitan Court No. 2 under domestic violence (DV) laws.
 
 In 2014, Lubna also moved an Islamic court run by   in Sarkhej, which issued a public notice and summoned Pathan and his son. Pathan filed a criminal defamation case against Darul Qaza, asserting that he had no faith in its functioning and that issuing a public notice was not in purview of the body.
 
 In her DV complaint, Lubna also accused Firoz’s sister, Shabnam. The court soon deleted her name on finding that she did not live in the city and had no role to play in the matter. In 2013, Shabnam sued Lubna for defaming her by implicating her in a false case and demanded Rs 1 lakh as compensation. That suit is pending before a city civil court.
