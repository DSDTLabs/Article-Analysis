It’s been 360 years since the Battle of Dharmat (1658) was fought between   and Shah Jahan’s allies. And no one better than  , who plays Aurangzeb in the historical show ' ', can understand the significance of the battle. 

 A dozen generations ago, Singh’s great grand-uncle,   Singh Mahiarya (then only 19 and serving in the Kota army), fought the controversial Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on the battlefield of Dharmat, Ujjain.
 
 Rahul says, “My great grand-uncle was later summoned by Aurangzeb, who was impressed with his valour. He extended a friendly hand to him and announced that for as long as he lived, my great grand-uncle could walk in unannounced, and speak his mind.”
 
 Incidentally, Thakur Udaykaran died in a battle in the Marathwada region, just one day after Aurangzeb’s death. “History is far deeper than what we read in the classroom. Our future generations will emerge richer culturally and ethically if such incidents are included in the textbooks.”
 
 Considering his clan’s historical lineage, were there any apprehensions about playing Aurangzeb, who was pitted against his great grand-uncle? He answers, “Not at all. That’s my karm (work).”
 
 In the show, Rahul is playing an elderly Aurangzeb. “I asked the makers why I had been approached to play the 80-plus emperor. They said that they wanted youthful trigger with ageless vigour! So, here I am,” he laughs.
