COIMBATORE: Bringing to light serious violations of labour laws in a powerloom unit here, the national human rights commission ( ) has issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government, after probing the case of death due to electrocution of a six-year-old girl in the unit.

 The girl, daughter of a couple held as bonded labourers in the unit, died when she touched an electric fence erected illegally in September 2014. Issuing the notice to the chief secretary on Thursday, Nhrc sought to know why a relief of Rs 3 lakh should not be given to the family of the child.

He has also been asked to ensure their rehabilitation as per the Provisions of Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 and submit compliance report with the proof of payment within six weeks.

Nandhini was studying in class I in a government school in the locality while her sister Narmadha was studying class III in the same school.
 
 Balasubramanian was given Rs 60,000 as an advance by the power loom owners   and Nagaraj. He was asked to stay along with his family in the premises and leave from the work after he repays the money.
 
 On August 29, Balasubramanian and Thulasi wanted to go their native, but the powerloom owners allegedly denied permission to take their daughters too, suspecting that the family may not return. With no adults to keep tab on her, Nandhini touched the electric fence and died on the spot. While the powerloom unit owners attempted to hush up the death, the issue came to came to light because of social activists.
