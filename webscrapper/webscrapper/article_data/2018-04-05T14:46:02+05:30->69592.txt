The auditorium reverberated with applause when   performed at the second day of the   Series 2018 organised by   on Wednesday. The classical flautist was performing at   Delhi during the 18- day long Virasat Series and mesmerised the audience with his mellifluous renditions. 
The concert was purely based on audience's request as after every piece, the flautist asked audience what they wanted and responded to their requests promptly. Some of these raags include Bhupali, Marwa, Yaman, and Hamsadhwani.
