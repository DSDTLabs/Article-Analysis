 He now runs the   and   on a plot owned by his father and struggling to give it a facelift.There are 300 children in Shishu Vatika and over a 100 students in Sarvodaya High School. "Initially there were very few children when I started the junior wing 3 years ago. But the number of students has increased now," said Sanjay. 
 
 He charges a small amount as fees from the rural students but does not prevent them from continuing if they cannot pay as students from the surrounding as well as the remote forest villages come to study there.
