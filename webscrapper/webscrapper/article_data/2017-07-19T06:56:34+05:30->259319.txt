MUMBAI: The city's   (SBOA) has threatened to keep 8,000 buses off the road from August 1 to protest against the illegal vans that continue to ply children. The association is also protesting against the poor condition of the roads which makes it difficult for them to ferry children during the rains.

 SBOA president   said the vans were a nuisance and a risk to children's safety . “The central government has said that vans must not be used to ferry schoolchildren but the state authorities continue to give permission for the same. We have to undergo fitness tests twice a year but the vans get away without following any rules.These is discrimination for the sake of vested interest.“
 
 Last week the SBOA launched a drive to keep check on illegal vans which flout rules under school bus safety policy . The association has collected photographs and also list of nearly100 vans whose details will be forwarded to transport department for action.
 
 Atransport official, however, said that some of the vehicles with seats less than 13 were given permits in the past, and they cannot be taken off roads “overnight“. The RTO plans to review the permit of these vehicles at the time of annual inspections passing.
 
 The association has also urged its staff to click pictures of the potholes to report it to the civic bodies. “Potholes make it very difficult for our drivers to navigate especially when there are kids on board.We want the state to take prompt action,“ said Garg.
