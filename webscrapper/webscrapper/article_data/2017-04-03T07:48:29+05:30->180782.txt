AMARAVATI: The suspense over the allocation of portfolios to ministers continued till late in the night as chief minister   was reportedly busy pacifying leaders who were left disgruntled after missing cabinet berths. 

 It is believed that it is taking a long time to finalise the portfolios as Naidu wants to go for a complete rehaul of the departments, including change of portfolios of serving ministers besides allocation to the newly-inducted ministers. 
 
 Initially, the chief minister wanted to complete the allocation of portfolios by Sunday evening itself. But he could not spend much time on the issue as he was left keeping tracking of the rebel voices in the party and dousing the flames. The CM is now expected to announce the portfolios on Monday. 
 
 According to party sources, except for finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu and water resources minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao, portfolios of all the ministers are expected to be changed. Sources said that the chief minister is planning to change the portfolios of both the deputy chief ministers, KE Krishna Murthy and Nimmakaala China Rajappa. 
 
 Interestingly, the officials of the   (CRDA) have started scouting for chambers to be allocated to the 11 new ministers. After finding that there is lack of space in the existing buildings, the officials have decided to convert four conference halls into ministers' chambers. Sources said that CRDA officials have sought a fortnight's time to bring in the required changes to provide chambers to the new ministers.
