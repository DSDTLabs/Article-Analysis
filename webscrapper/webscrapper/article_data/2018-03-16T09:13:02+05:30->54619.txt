MUMBAI: The Powai police on Wednesday arrested a   member of the Junnar zilla parishad, Gulab   (53), for extorting money from his former employer, the   Group. Parkhe had been demanding Rs 20 crore since June 2017, and had threatened to make public documents about the group that would impact its business and stall its projects if he was not paid.

 Though the group paid him Rs 10 lakh earlier this year, his demands for more money continued, resulting in Hiranandani executives filing a police complaint on Wednesday and laying a trap for him by asking him to come to a hotel in Mulund (W) to collect the amount. Parkhe was caught when he turned up at the hotel to accept Rs 1 crore.
