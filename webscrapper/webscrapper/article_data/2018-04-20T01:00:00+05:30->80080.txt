 Talking about his leading actors, Majidi says, “I’m so happy to present these two stars to the world of cinema. We have shared a beautiful journey together and I'm glad to share this with the world today. Ishaan and Malavika have a bright future ahead of them. Ishaan has a lot of raw talent and energy and if honed correctly, he can perform beyond expectations. Through this process, he has become like a son to me. Malavika fit the brief of Tara (her character in the film) perfectly and she has done a great job. I've taught them all I could. I do hope they use those learnings and make good choices for themselves in the future."
