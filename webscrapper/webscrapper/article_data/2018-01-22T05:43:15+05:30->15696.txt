Calm, and egrets too, returned to   lake on Sunday, two days after the city's most polluted waterbody was ravaged by a fire. The   has now announced that it will ask   to launch a drive to rid the 960-acre body of grass, weed and garbage.

 "Stopping sewage from entering the lake by building STPs will take time. But we can't sit quiet till then. The immediate priority is to remove grass, garbage and ensure that the lake is properly fenced,"   chairman   said. 
 
  The KSPCB's preliminary investigation revealed that dry grass coupled with garbage dumps fuelled the fire. The cause of the fire will be known in a couple of days after lab reports are released, Lakshman said.
 
 Friday's fire raged for 30 hours and had burnt 40 acres of the lake area.
 
 Meanwhile, Bengaluru development minister   on Sunday took exception to what he called politicization of the Bellandur lake issue by   leaders.
