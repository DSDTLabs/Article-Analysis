HYDERABAD: The number of vehicles hitting city roads may be accelerating by the day, but the number of permanent driving licences (DLs) being issued is slowing down. Surprisingly, the number of learner’s licences (LLs) being issued in the city by the   ( ) has overtaken the number of DLs being issued, every year since 2013. While the total number of DLs issued stood at 6,37,053 in 2013, only 4,28,993 DLs were issued in 2017. 

  
  
 
 In contrast, 6,39,217 LLs were issued in 2017, shows data available with the state RTA. In fact, between 2016 and 2017, a 28% dip was recorded in the total number of permanent DLs being issued by RTA. And till March 2018, only 1,04,127 permanent DLs were issued as compared to 1,58,060 LLs.
 
  
  
 
 While agents working in the field said this could indicate a high number of LLs being dropped every year, driving school staff point out that many prefer to ‘re-apply’ for their LL instead of renewing it or graduating to a permanent DL.
 
 “In Hyderabad, many people do not approach the RTA for their permanent licences for more than six months after getting their learner’s licences, by which time the learner’s permit would have expired. They then apply for a fresh learner’s permit rather than renewing their expired LL since the application for both follows the same process and entails the same fee,” said  , who works with a driving school in the city.
 
 According to touts, while the fee to obtain a learner’s and then a permanent DL stands anywhere between ?4000-5000, including the commission and application fees, the fee for just the LL, which is valid for a period of six months, is only ?1,500, another reason why many initially prefer to take only the learner’s licence.
