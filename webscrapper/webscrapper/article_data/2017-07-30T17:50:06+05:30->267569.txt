MANGALURU: Sunday saw Mangalore Bicycle Club (MbC) undertake a double  . If the members and their family hit the pedals as is their regular wont, this Sunday also saw them plant   on the premises of their registered office at   in the city as well on the Tannirbhavi road stretch. Around 30 riders planted fruit saplings on the premises of their registered office before starting the ride to nearby Tannirbhavi.

 Armed with 200 seed balls sponsored by  , MbC members dropped them along Tannirbhavi stretch and enroute as part of their Vanamahotsava celebrations. Cyclists split into a group of 5 members and dropped the seed balls distributed to them at appropriate spots. Idea of the ride was to contribute to environment conservation and afforestation. Seed balls consisted of seeds of flowering and fruit plants, Ganesh Nayak, secretary, MbC said.
 
 This concept of seed bombing is widely used across the globe to ensure the barren lands and empty plots of land are efficiently used to add greenery to the neighborhood, Ganesh said. Moreover seed ball bombing or dropping is gaining popularity across due to the fact that plants which are used for seed balls are low on maintenance and have high chances of growing due to initial nutritional content the ball has for sprouting of the seeds and future growth of the plants.
 
 MbC concluded vanamahotsava 2017 celebration with a decision to continue this initiative throughout the year and not restrict it to any part of the year. The club will try and source seed balls and urge their members to carry them during all their rides. With this approach, the club believes it will be able to convert barren land in and around this coastal city into a greener space slowly and steadily and help the city gain on its lost forest cover, Ganesh added.
