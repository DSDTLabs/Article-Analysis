VIJAYAWADA: In a bid to minimise the number of class X dropouts, especially girls,   ( ) has set up   intermediate colleges at 26 locations in the state. The intermediate board is also in the process of approving the colleges, and the classes are expected to begin from this academic year.

He said construction will take place at locations where land is available and buildings will be rented at location where land is not available. A total of Rs 50 crores is expected for the construction, and a recurring cost of about Rs 10 crores is expected for the postings and other maintenance. The program is sponsored by the state government and SSA.
 
 A total 4,160 students will benefited from the intermediate colleges. Four groups will be offered in the colleges, which include MPC, BiPC, MEC, and   with 40 students in each group per college. All these colleges will be residential with free education, just as the KGBV schools across the state.
