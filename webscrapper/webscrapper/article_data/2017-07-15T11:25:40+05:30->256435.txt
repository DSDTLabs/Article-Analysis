VADODARA: A group of students led by M S   Union (MSUSU) vice-president (VP) on Friday demanded that warden of K   should be removed from her post for misbehaving with girls.

 The students’ group made a representation before chief warden of Halls of   Parmar alleging that warden of K G Hall   not only misbehaves with the girls residing in the hall but she has also misappropriated money collected as penalty from students. 
 
 “The warden of K G Hall runs the girls’ hostel as a dictator. She abuses girl students and openly insults them without any fault of the girls,” alleged MSUSU VP Priyanka Patel. She alleged that since last several years Sharma had been collecting Rs 50 as penalty from girls who reach late at the hostel. “Against this penalty which she collects, she does not even issue a receipt. She has misappropriated a huge amount in the name of penalty,” she alleged.
 
  Further, Patel alleged that Sharma locks the main gate of the hostel time and again. “Girl students from other halls are not allowed to enter K G Hall or cannot even talk to their peers in other halls,” she said, adding that because of lack of cleanliness, the hostel raises a stink.
 
  “There are drinking water problems, mosquito menace which have not been resolved and neither have the rooms been renovated,” she said.
 
  Officials were however not available for comment.
