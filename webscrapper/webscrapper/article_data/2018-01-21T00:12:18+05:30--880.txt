KOLKATA: The closing ceremony of   ended on a controversial note on Saturday with Sugata Bose, the outgoing  , mentioning that   College should remember that there was a tradition of “loyalism” around 100 years back but “one should not take pride in the tradition of loyalism in today’s date”. 

 Bose went on to applaud Malabika Sarkar, the previous vice-chancellor, saying that she had implemented the suggestions of the mentor group to appoint world-class faculty without any “political interference”. His speech raised the question if the current recruitment process is being “influenced” by politics.
 
 Bose added that there is no contradiction between an egalitarian spirit and search for excellence. “I am not in favour of elitism, but only in favour of excellence. We have to move towards genuine excellence and allow students from most disadvantageous backgrounds to come to Presidency and fulfill their potential,” he said. 
 
 He also expressed his reservations over “small but sentimental aspects of the heritage that has been altered on the campus”.
 
 Vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia, who was present on the dais when the alumni members criticized some of her decisions, refused to comment on the matter.
 
 Poet Sankha Ghosh hinted at the frequent clash between the authorities and the alumni association, saying: “Being in power and showing it off is not the same thing as taking responsibility and being involved. There should be a deep respect and bond between teachers and students without which an institute can’t thrive.” 
 
 Ghosh also raised concerns over students refusing to make   as their first choice for studying undergraduate courses. “I am not pointing this out for seats remaining vacant, which can happen due to several reasons. However, this is a serious concern why young students do not prefer coming to study in the institute, which has always been the most preferred destination,” he said.
