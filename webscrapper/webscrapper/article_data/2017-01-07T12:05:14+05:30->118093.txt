HYDERABAD: A combination of clear skies and cold winds from the north are responsible for the cold wave that has hit the city. Temperatures have dropped a few degrees lower than is usual for this time of the year, and the conditions are likely to last for the next 24 hours. Meteorological experts said this is typical in winter.

 “Whenever there are clear skies, the long-wave radiation from the sun, which heats the earth's surface during the day , escapes at night,“ said  , member secretary of the   .
 
 The minimum temperature is expected to dip as low as eight degrees Celsius over the next few days.
 
 According to experts from private weather forecasting firms like  , whenever the sky is clear, the long-wave radiation increases due to the heat from the earth's surface being released. This leads to a fall in night temperatures.
 
 These two factors, clear sky and cold winds from north direction are responsible for the   and experts expect a further fall in temperature over the next 24 to 48 hours.
 
 “Whenever there is cloudy sky, temperature tends to rise as the long-wave radiation released from the surface at night time is trapped between earth and cloud.
 
 This leads to increase in temperatures. Even if there are no clouds, the heat is some times trapped in fog or smog,“ said Ramesh. He added that anthropomorphic reasons like excessive pollution or release of greenhouse gases could trap the heat.
 
 Another reason that experts cite for the drop in temperature is the lack of winds from the south-eastern direction, which are warm and humid in nature. “As of now, cold northwesterly winds will continue for another 48 hours. Therefore, we expect cold wave conditions to continue for the next two days. If there were winds from the west-southwestern direction the temperatures would have gone up,“ said Dr  , a scientist with the Indian Meteorological Department.
