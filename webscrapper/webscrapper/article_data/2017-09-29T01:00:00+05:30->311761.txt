Actor   will soon embark on a ‘dream’ journey. He is all set to pursue a course in Oneirology, which is the scientific study of dreams.

 The actor, who played the male lead in ' ' and won the last season of ' ' along with his wife  , plans to take up the course seriously. Vivek shares, “I’ve had grand, vivid dreams for many years now. In fact, I would often wake up feeling that I have just seen a large-scale film. Since it would get difficult to remember all my dreams, I started penning them down in a diary. Initially, I didn’t know what they meant, but as I started doing research, I found out about Oneirology. I read up about the subject and started to teach myself. However, there is so much to learn that I will soon take up a course in the subject, perhaps during my next break between shows.”
 
 The actor, who also is a storyteller, says, “I would like to adapt my dreams into films once I have learnt and understood their meaning. I guard my ‘dream diary’ zealously and hope to bring it to life someday.”
