HYDERABAD: Justice A Shankar Narayana of the   on Monday reserved his orders in two separate pleas filed by   Chief Y S   and some of his party leaders including Jogi Ramesh and others who were urging the court to quash the two   filed at   station in Krishna district against them on February 28 when they intervened with the authorities after a road mishap that resulted in 11 deaths and several injuries. 

 Appearing for Jagan, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy questioned the action of the authorities in booking cases against an opposition leader for raising a voice against negligence and official apathy in the ghastly road accident. The negligence and cover up exercises were so pronounced that doctors did not conduct post mortem on the dead body of the driver who caused the accident.
 
 Further, the ill-fated private bus that was involved in the mishap at Nandigama actually belongs to a ruling party legislator and that after the accident, the duties that had to have been done by the authorities were not carried out. When the opposition leader questions this, the state resorts to registering FIRs against the leader which is unheard of, the senior counsel said.
