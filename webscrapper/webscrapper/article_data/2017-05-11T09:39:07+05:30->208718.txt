THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After the successful launch of GSAT-9 on board GSLV-Mk II,   centres here including   Space Centre (VSSC) and Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) are back from Sriharikota. Now, the team of scientists and engineers are focussed on the next mission - GSLV-MK III, boosted with fully indigenous  . The   will launch the communication satellite GSAT-19 in May. 

 "In the previous GSLV launches, some parts of the indigenous cryogenic upper stage (CUS) engine were procured from Russia, but GSLV-Mark II had more indigenous CUS with propellant acquisition system. We used electric propulsion for the first time as part of the launch," said VSSC director K Sivan.
 
 GSLV-Mark II was the eleventh flight of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and the fourth consecutive success achieved by GSLV carrying indigenously developed CUS, the scientists said.
 
 "Now we are focussed on the launch of the developmental flight of GSLV-Mk III-D1 to launch the GSAT-19, a communication satellite with advanced spacecraft technologies including bus subsystem experiments in electrical propulsion System and indigenous lithium ion battery," GSLV Mk III project director G Ayyappan said. This GSLV-MK III rocket with totally indigenous CUS will weigh about 3.5 tons as against the GSLV-MK II vehicle with indigenous CUS stage weighing 2.2 tons, he said.
 
 LPSC director   had earlier said that the GSLV-Mk III is set to launch the communication satellite GSAT-19 by May end and then Earth observation satellite Cartosat-2E will be launched via PSLV-C38 by June first week.
