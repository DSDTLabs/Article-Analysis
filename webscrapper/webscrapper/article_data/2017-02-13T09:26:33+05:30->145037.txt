CHANDIGARH: The recent decision by Hong Kong to disallow visa on arrival to Indians upset the plans of   jailbreak mastermind Gurpreet   to flee the country. The funding for their gang wars and wherewithal for supari killings were provided by the gang’s conspirator   from Hong Kong.

 Since their sensational escape from Nabha prison, Romy was trying to arrange their visa to Hong Kong after the new rules were announced on December 21. Romy, who was arrested for credit card fraud with several US and Europe firms, had jumped his bail in June, barely three months before the Nabha jailbreak. He was also lodged in Nabha jail.
 
 According to the new law, Hong Kong, which is a popular tourist destination for Indians, has scrapped visa-free 14-day stay for any visit after January 23. People traveling from India to Hong Kong will have to register online in advance.
 
 The cops, after scrutinizing one of Sekhon’s phone calls and suspicious movement of his family members had laid a trap by putting one undercover cop as a decoy travel agent. It was this agent who finally led the sleuths to Sekhon’s hideout.
