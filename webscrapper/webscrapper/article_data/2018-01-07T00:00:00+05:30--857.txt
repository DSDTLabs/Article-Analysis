The upcoming   film   deals with how money impacts a good man, so it made sense to its leading man,  , to centre the promotional activities also around money. One such was a series of social experiments that he undertook with his team, to gauge how regular people would react to the prospect of getting some  . 
“We did three distinct sets of experiments, all of which were about money. Shot candidly and without telling them that we were a movie team, we approached 10 couples offering the lady in each Rs 2,000 if she would   her partner/husband. Seven actually took the money and hit their partners. In another scenario, we observed the reaction that people had when they found money on the floor. At least half of the people we encountered claimed the note as their own, while the rest said that they had found someone’s money. The third was even more interesting, where we got one of our team members to pretend to be visually challenged. He would then approach random people with a note of a higher denomination believing it to be of much lesser value. For instance, we would give him a Rs 500 note and tell him to ask people for change for the Rs 200 or Rs 100 note he had. While some took the opportunity to con him, there were others who pointed out the actual value of the currency,” explains Rohitt.
 And the final verdict? “When it’s about free money, perspectives change, and more often than not, people always say yes to it,” he signs off.
