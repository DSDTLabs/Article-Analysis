TRICHY: A 28-year-old man was electrocuted in   while removing banners erected for T T V Dhinakaran-led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagamâ€™s protest against central government for not constituting the Cauvery Management Board. Police sources identified the deceased as Nandakumar, son of Durai of E Pudur. 

 On Saturday, as Dhinakaran participated in the protest near the Trichy collectorate, more than 50 banners were placed on either side of the Collector Office Road and on the traffic islands of Major Saravanan roundabout. This jeopardized the safety of road users. TOI had also reported (edition dated April 22) the damage caused to the newly laid collector office road for erecting banners welcoming the R K Nagar MLA. After the protests ended, stage decorators, including Nandakumar, were removing the hoardings along the collector office road. During the process, the metal frame of a hoarding came in contact with a livewire, and Nandakumar was electrocuted. He was rushed to the   where he died. 
 
 After the incident, police removed the hoardings on Collector Office road. The Cantonment police have registered a case.
