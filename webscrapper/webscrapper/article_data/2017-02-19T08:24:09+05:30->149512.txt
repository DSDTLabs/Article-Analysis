DIGHA: Toy trains, an exclusive feature of the  , will now run along the Digha sea coast as well. In tune with chief minister  's drive to turn Digha into another Goa, the state government plans to start toy train services from Udaypur beach on the Bengal-Odisha border to old Digha's permanent picnic spot.

 To be executed by the   (DSDA), the 2km route will run between the coastline and NH-116B connecting Digha to Udaypur and beyond. With an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore, the project plan was approved by the DSDA board on Friday .The state is banking on Digha's increased popularity among tourists in recent years and hopes visitors will avail the toy train service. Currently , tourists have to hire cars to travel from old Digha to Udaypur.
 
 DSDA chairman and   MP Sisir Adhikary said, “The approved plan has been sent to the state finance department. We expect clea rance in a week. Though earlier conceived as a public­private partnership project, it will now be executed by DSDA itself.“ DSDA CEO   said, “ A tender for laying tracks and construction of terminal stations on both ends will be floated after the clearance. We will invite bids from firms with expertise in executing railway track projects.The estimated cost includes the price of one toy train with 2-3 coaches.“
 
 Regarding the stations, Dutta said, “We will first run the service between the terminal points. If the service becomes popular , we may consider having two stations enroute at Konika Ghat and Police Holiday Home. In future, we would extend the route 4km further into old Digha proper and add more trains.“
 
 Meanwhile, DSDA 's marine drive project to build a 19km metalled road linking old Digha to Mandarmoni along the coast is nearing completion.Once complete, the marine drive along the beaches will shorten the current roundabout 35km journey between the two sea resorts.
