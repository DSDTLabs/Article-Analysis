GUWAHATI: Thanks to burgeoning betting rackets across the state, the Indian Premier League (IPL) - India's richest sports event - has turned into a major headache for the state police. With the tournament reaching its finale this week, there has been a consequent rise in the operations of such betting rackets. Raising their game as well, the CID has launched a crackdown and nabbed at least two persons from the city since Tuesday. 

 "One   was arrested from   for allegedly running an IPL betting racket. Based on his revelation, the CID raided several other locations and nabbed another counterpart of the racket,   from Fancy Bazar, on Wednesday night," CID sources informed. Two of their alleged accomplices,   and  , are currently absconding.
