MARGAO: Cracking the whip against illegal shops and business in the city,   ( ) on Wednesday sealed 10 shops which failed to produce trade licences to the raiding team. 

 An MMC team, headed by accounts and taxation officer (ATO) Abhay Rane, and comprising market inspectors and municipal engineers went about checking trade licences of commercial units. While five shops in Malbhat were sealed in the morning, the team sealed five more in Rangavi building near the Margao municipality in the evening.
 
 Malbhat houses the residence of Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, and the MMC’s decision to begin its crackdown in this commercial area has alerted political observers to the undercurrents of power in Margao and Fatorda constituencies.   is currently out of station. Minister for town and country planning Vijai Sardesai holds sway over the 25-member MMC with both the chairperson and deputy chairperson belonging to his   (GFP). 
 
 While the operation passed off smoothly on Wednesday, the MMC’s decision to grant 24-hours to a bank in Rangavi building to produce its trade documents invited criticism from the public. When the MMC team was about to seal the bank premises, the ATO received a call from the chief officer to grant time to the bank. “When all other shops which failed to produce documents were sealed instantly, why was this leniency showed to the bank?” onlookers questioned.
 
 The MMC’s action comes after the single-window system introduced by it to facilitate quick processing of applications for new trade licences evoked a poor response. 
 
 The crackdown operations will resume on Thursday, sources said.
