PATNA:  , the festival of colours, brings with it many skin and hair problems due to the rampant use of chemical colours. People, especially women, find it difficult to remove colours from their skin and hair post Holi. As most of the parlours too remain closed due to the festival, people struggle to get rid of colours, water and everything else that their friends unleash on them on Holi.

 Experts, therefore, have some valuable tips to offer to Holi revellers to get rid of stubborn colours. Shalini Vashisht, owner of a beauty-cum-wellness clinic on Gola Road, said people should be very cautious as festival of colours often leads to hair loss and skin dryness.
 
 “People should use hair cream before playing colours. This will form a protective layer between the colours and hair, making it easy to remove them afterwards,” Vashisht said, adding one can also apply herbal oil on the hair to keep colours at bay. “To protect the skin, one should use moisturizer. Women should paint their nails with a dark colour,” she added.
 
 Rahul Tiwari, owner of a beauty salon on Boring Road, said one should rinse the face with plenty of water before using a cleansing cream or lotion. “Massage your face well and wipe off with moist cotton wool. Remember to cleanse the area around the eyes too. A cleansing gel can dissolve the colours and facilitate their removal,” Tiwari said.
