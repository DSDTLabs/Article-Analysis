One look at the waste generated during parent-teacher meetings and other events in her daughter’s school and   knew that she had to do something. Rishita, who has been organizing zero-waste parties and events through  , approached   founder  , who, for their recent Annual Day, did away with all single-use items for their first zero-waste event.

 “Earlier, the school used to give kids individual cardboard snack boxes. Parents were given beverages and food on paper/plastic cups and plates. This year, they hired steel cutlery. All parents were also sent an email, asking them to send empty boxes and bottles for their wards to eat and drink out of, which eliminated the need to rent cutlery for them. The school gave snacks to kids in their boxes. The food vendor was asked to distribute snacks for parents and teachers on biodegradable areca nut plates. Next time, I will push for them to rent cutlery for that as well, so that there is no wastage,” says Rishita, who adds that the decoration were also all ‘green’. Thermocol and balloons were replaced with paper and cardboard decorations. No flexes were used and the stage decoration was made with cloth and paper.
 
 Stuti says that although it was hard to implement these changes, the school will stick to having zero-waste events. “It’s easy to go to the market and pick up plastic cups and plates. But it felt good that in one small event, we didn’t use any plastic. I truly feel that it’s high time we think about the environment, since we have already done quite a bit a damage. Also, it sets a good example for the kids. We want parents to be role models to kids, instead of just telling them to be eco conscious. I hope that at least one or two parents were inspired to follow suit,” she says.
