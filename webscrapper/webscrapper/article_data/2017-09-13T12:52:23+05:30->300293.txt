VADODARA: Following the flash floods in north Gujarat, the state government has shifted its focus on reconstruction of houses for those who have been displaced. 

 City-based Occupational and   has made a representation to chief minister   urging him not use asbestos cement sheets for construction of new homes.
 
 National coordinator of the NGO   said that after calamities in the past too, asbestos cement sheets have been used for reconstruction of the houses. 
 
 “The asbestos cement sheets are available at low cost, therefore these are widely used for roofing but in long-run it has several negative results,” said Patel.
 
 He added that the government should take proper policy decision regarding this so that in future too asbestos cement sheets are not used for rehabilitation operations nor for any other purpose. 
 
 According to Patel, asbestos cement sheets are extremely toxic for human health. 
 
 “A person who is exposed to asbestos can be afflicted with lung cancer, cancer of mesothelioma or cancer of vocal cord,” he added.
 
 Patel also mentioned in his letter to the CM that the Indian railways too have started to replace the asbestos cement sheets, which were used for roofing, from all its railway stations. After a verdict of Kolkata high court,   was the first state in the country to become asbestos-free state, he added.
