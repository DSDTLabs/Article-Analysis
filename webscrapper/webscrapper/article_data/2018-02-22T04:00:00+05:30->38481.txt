Mumbai:   governor   in the monetary policy committee ( ) meeting earlier last month had said that there are several signs of growth impulses strengthening. However, he has also cautioned about the high   ‘crowding out’ private investment.

 The ‘crowding out’ effect refers to a situation where high-government borrowing results in lesser funds being available for private investments such that it dampens the initial increase of total investment spending. In the minutes of MPC released on Wednesday, Patel said that in addition to creating inflationary pressures the “high fiscal deficit has attendant ‘crowding-out’ implications with regard to the cost of private domestic credit”.
 
 Despite the growth impulses, the governor said that the recovery was nascent and needed to be protected compelling him to vote for keeping interest rates on hold.
 
 On growth impulses, Patel had said that manufacturing activity has picked up with the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) expanding for the sixth consecutive month in January, led by new orders. “There are also early signs of revival of investment activity. Many service sector indicators have shown robust growth such as commercial vehicle sales, domestic & international air passenger traffic, and foreign tourist arrivals,” said Patel.
 
 The MPC voted 5:1 at the meeting to keep the policy rate on hold at 6% and to retain its “neutral” monetary policy stance. RBI executive director   was the sole member to vote for a 25-basic point hike (100 bps = 1 percentage point).
 
 The minutes released on Wednesday showed widespread concerns among the six MPC members about inflation, which accelerated to a 17-month high of 5.2% in December from a year earlier, driven higher by food and energy.
