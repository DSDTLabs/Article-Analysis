Panaji: Goa can count itself lucky at the Fifa U-17 World Cup 2017.

 Goa’s response for the biggest   tournament to be staged on the subcontinent has been poor; at last count only 200 people had bought tickets for the first Fifa tournament to be staged in the country. But ticket sales are now expected to shoot up phenomenally after the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda was marked to host two giants of world football, Germany and Brazil.
 
 Germany will play a minimum of two group matches at Fatorda, including the opener against Costa Rica on October 7 at 5pm, while Brazil will play their last group D match against Niger here on October 13 at 8pm.
 
 Fatorda, among the six venues, will host group C which includes Germany, Costa Rica, Iran and Guinea while Brazil are placed in group D which will be based in Kochi. The last league matches, however, are played simultaneously to avoid match-fixing, and with just one venue cleared in each state to host matches, one group match will be played elsewhere.
 
 “Goa is really lucky. We get football powerhouse Germany and one game involving Brazil, everyone’s eternal favourites,” said Shrinivas Dempo, venue director for the U-17 World Cup.
