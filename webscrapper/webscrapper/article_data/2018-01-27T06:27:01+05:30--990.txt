HYDERABAD: As the automatic traffic signals, installed in 2016, have failed to work properly at several intersections, signals have reverted to manual mode leading to increasing traffic congestion in the city.

 Currently, the city has 221 signals, including 129 in Hyderabad and 92 in  , equipped with virtual loop cameras for better synchronisation, as part of the   project. 
 
 The junctions and stretches are analysed and traffic stops scheduled between 90 seconds and three minutes at different times of the day. However, the increased duration of a red light at various junctions prompts people to jump the signal.
 
 "The signal stays red for 180 seconds at the   and stays green only for 10 seconds. This longer duration of the red light has made commuting very inconvenient. I end up waiting for five minutes at the same spot," said  , an IT employee.
 
 The manual operation of signals coupled with frequent VIP movement add to the agony of driving. 
 
 Among the junctions most affected are   check post, IIIT junction, Kothaguda junction, Khairatabad, Masab Tank and Cyber Towers, where the stoppage period is at times as high as 190 seconds and green signal only for about 30 seconds.
 
 Officials admit excessive congestion along these stretches making it difficult for the system to work. "The traffic signal at junctions such as Paradise and commercial tax office is operated manually most of the times since the automatic mode fails to function effectively in heavy traffic," said  , inspector (traffic), Hyderabad.
