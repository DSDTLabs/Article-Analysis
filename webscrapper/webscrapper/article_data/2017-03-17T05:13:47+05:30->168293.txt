LUCKNOW: After a prolonged family feud in the Samajwadi Party’s first family,   and his uncle   got together for the first time on Thursday for a closed-door meeting to decide the future course of action for the party.

 The bonhomie between them was, however, missing, giving rise to speculations that their coming together was more of a “need of the hour rather than a sign of truce” within the Yadav clan. 
 
 The meeting, held at the party headquarters in Lucknow, lasted about 40 minutes and was attended by senior party leaders   and   as well. 
 
 Before the meeting started, Shivpal was heading to take a seat among the MLAs but Azam took him to the dais to be seated next to Akhilesh.
