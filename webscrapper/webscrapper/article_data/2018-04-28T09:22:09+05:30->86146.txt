CHANDIGARH: Emphasising on the urgent need to go for crop diversification to tackle the problem of stubble burning, Punjab governor   suggested incentives for   who have already adopted better and environment-friendly alternatives to dispose of crop residue. 

 Speaking at the workshop on stakeholder initiative to address crop residue burning in Punjab, he expressed concern over the emerging environmental hazards caused by stubble burning.
 
 Badnore suggested the need to promote horticulture, fruit and mushroom cultivation in a big way in Punjab to break the usual paddy-wheat crop cycle.
 
 He said not only a comprehensive strategy should be generated for mass-level awareness among farmers, but available technologies should also be provided at affordable prices.
 
 He complimented the Punjab Agriculture University for keeping a close contact with the state farmers and giving them required suggestions from time to time.
 
 Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra suggested there should be more soil testing laboratories in Punjab with effective implementation of the government plans at the ground level.
 
 Suresh Kumar, chief principal secretary to the Punjab chief minister, said the government would constitute a state-level advisory group to design some immediate action plan to check stubble burning and urged the governor to be the patron. There would be smaller groups of technical work force in order to carry out the decisions of the state-level advisory group in this regard.
 
 Kumar also called upon the agriculture experts attending the workshop to work towards reducing the silica content from the straw and making it fit for animal consumption. He said Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh could be given the fodder at lower prices where there was a shortage of animal fodder. Kumar also asked the progressive farmers of the state to make young farmers aware of the new emerging technologies in paddy straw management.
