The cradle ceremony of Aamer Javeed’s son, Syed Arhaan Amjad Javeed, held at a Begumpet venue on Monday, had the who’s who of the city’s P3Ps in attendance. The grand garden venue was lit up colourfully, setting the mood for the night. Aamer and his wife   played the perfect hosts. After the traditional aqeeqa ritual, the guests were treated to a mehfil-e-ghazal. The celebrations went on late into the night with friends catching up over sumptuous food.
