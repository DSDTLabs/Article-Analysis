Narendra was one such guy who made it on his own and was doing good work."
 Filmmaker Rahul Dholakia, who directed Narendra in 'Raees', told BT, “I can’t believe that he is no more. Why are we losing people so young? First Sridevi and now, Narendra. When we were casting for the role of Musa Bhai in Raees, I wanted an actor with a towering personality, who had a good voice and could hold fort opposite Shah Rukh Khan. He justified the role completely.”
