KOLKATA: The Bidhannagar civic authorities will send a letter to the irrigation department on Monday, asking them to flush out the stagnant water of Kestopur canal, eastern drainage canal and Bagjola canal. Ahead of the 42nd Kolkata International Book Fair, which will start at Salt Lake’s Central Park fair ground from Tuesday, the authorities want to make Salt Lake mosquito-free.

  (health) Pranay Roy said they were in touch with the irrigation department on this issue. The stagnant water will be flushed out from the Chitpore lock gate. The water that will be flown in will flush Kestopur canal and then enter Bagjola canal after crossing the sluice gate near  . “We had verbally discussed the matter with the irrigation department officials. The canal waters will flow in from Tuesday. We want to see if some of that water can be directed towards the eastern drainage canal as well to clear any stagnation,” Roy said.
 
 Civic authorities said the flushing will be carried out on regular intervals to prevent stagnation.
 
 Kestopur canal and eastern drainage canal have always been regarded as potential mosquito breeding grounds. Last November, the civic authorities had sent a report to   mentioning that the garbage thrown into Kestopur canal by encroachers had stopped the flow of water and was turning the canal into a mosquito-breeding ground. The areas of Prafullakanan, Kestopur, Raghunathpur and   next to Kestopur canal were the worst affected by dengue last year.
 
 The civic authorities will also conduct a special vectorcontrol drive in and around the fair grounds during the book fair. “We will be taking all steps necessary to ensure that there is no mosquito at the grounds during the book fair,” said Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta.
 
 The civic authorities will also deploy a conservancy team for 24 -hour supervision to keep the fair grounds and its surroundings clean.
