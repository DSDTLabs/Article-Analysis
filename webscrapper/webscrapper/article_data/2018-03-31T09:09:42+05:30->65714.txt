 Addressing a press conference, Prayas secretary Kiran Binkar said, “It is working in the field of disability and rehabilitation since 2008 and is a school mainly for autistic children. It is generally observed that common people lack information about autism and are sometimes seen misbehaving with them or giving weird glances. Autistic kids do not realize that they are being ill-treated. But such looks hurt their near and dear ones.”
 
 Therefore, Prayas has been creating awareness among people so that such kids get social acceptance and are not maltreated, Binkar said.
 
 President Ritesh Diwe said autism is a neuro developmental disorder that usually affects communication and social behaviour of an individual. “At Prayas, we teach the kids as per their needs and concentrate mainly on social skills. We have observed that once people become aware about autism, their attitude is changed and they help kids lead a normal life,” he said.
 
 “We expect youngsters to get involved in creating awareness because once they understand the situation, they can be of great help to autistic people,” he added.
