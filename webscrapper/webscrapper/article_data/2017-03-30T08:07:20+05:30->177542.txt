COIMBATORE: In what could be termed as a sign of increasing biodiversity in Tamil Nadu, a long-legged buzzard (Buteo rufinus), an extremely rare bird of prey in this part of the region, was spotted at   Puliampatti Village in   district for the second time in four months.

 A group of birdwatchers had spotted the bird at the same location last year, Balaji PB, a bird watcher who hails from Puliampatti, told TOI. “There is no historical record of the bird being sighted before in Tamil Nadu. It was first spotted in Palladam by Chetankumar H Joshi, G Parameswaran, Gajamohanraj, Kishore Kumaran, Sivashankar Ramachandran and   on December 6. The group had visited the village to spot uncommon species like Eurasian cuckoo, tree pipit, Indian spotted eagle and European roller. The bird was in flight and later settled on a fence stone. Many photographs were taken for confirming its identity. Unfortunately, before anyone could take a closer look, it was mobbed by house crows and flew away,” said Balaji.
 
 Balaji again spotted the bird in approximately at the same location on March 12. “Birds of prey are active in the daytime when they exploit the rising thermals to gain height without much effort. It is, therefore, unsurprising that this bird was sighted in midday. It was roosting on an acacia tree along a mud road. Unlike the first occasion, the bird was quite and at peace, and offered good photographic opportunities. These photographs were later became invaluable in positively identifying the bird,” he said.
 
 Long-legged buzzards primarily inhabit open plains of Northern Africa, south-Eastern Europe, West and Central Asia, China and Central India.
 
 Bird watchers say the sightings are unique because there are no historical records of the bird in Tamil Nadu. Positive identification of the bird was also quite a challenge as it shares many features common with another winter migrant, common buzzard (Buteo buteo).
