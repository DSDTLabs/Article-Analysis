NEW DELHI: The government’s response to current flood situation in states like Assam and Gujarat has been the “quickest ever possible”, Union minister of state for home   claimed on Thursday even as he informed the   that 600 persons had died in flood-hit areas across the country.

 Rijiju rejected charge of bias in extending central assistance to the flood-affected states in the form of rescue teams and relief funds, brought up earlier by MPs like Madhusudhan Mistry (Congress) during discussion on the calling attention motion on flood situation in the country, saying that   had been instructed not to delay relief on account of “human error”.
 
 “I can assure this House that the government is fully committed to ensure that nobody suffers due to want of the action by government of India. We are fully committed.
 
 We reassure state governments that we will be there whenever you require us,” he said. Rijiju insisted that the government of India could not be biased in its approach and intent in providing flood assistance saying that it was not possible for PM to visit every affected place. 
 
 “Even the minister cannot go and settle the issues on the ground,” he said adding that responding to flood situation was the primary responsibility of states, with district administrations under them, and Centre only supplemented the efforts.
