When the   of Pataudi – Late   – wrote a   couplet to impress  , the actress, who had limited knowledge of Urdu, thought that it was he who had penned those lines. 

  Talking about her relationship with Urdu at a session at the   festival in Delhi, Sharmila Tagore said, "I will tell you about an incident to make you understand my limitation of Urdu. When I was shooting with Feroze (Khan) and I told him, ‘You know what, Tiger has written this beautiful thing for me – dil-e-nadan tujhe hua kya hai, aakhir is dard ki dawa kya hai’. So Feroze said, ‘You idiot woman, this is Ghalib, for god’s sake! So from there to now, I have progressed a little."
 
  Stressing how bad she was with her pronunciation, she added, "When I met Tiger, he introduced me to Begum Akhtar and Talat Mehmood. I had been listening to Begum Akhtar the whole day and saying to Shashi (Kapoor), ‘Khuda Hafiz’, and he would say, ‘half ‘his’ and half mine'" (to correct her pronunciation).
