A few days back,   received a letter from Prime Minister   inviting him to lend his support to the Swachhata Hi Seva movement. And the actor says that he is not just proud to become a part of the PM's initiative, but has also put aside a few days from his schedule to contribute to the Swachh Bharat mission. The actor was in Delhi to promote his upcoming movie 'Judwaa 2', and he told us that he will be shooting something very soon to promote the mission.

  "I have planned to shoot something special and I am going to talk about it soon. As citizens, it is our collective responsibility to keep our cities clean and inspire others to do so. What Modiji is doing with   is a huge inspiration for all of us. Children should be taught about this in schools. I was taught by my teachers to keep the country clean, and whenever I would travel abroad, I would always think, ‘Why is it that other countries are much cleaner than ours?’ As a child, my mother taught me to keep my surroundings clean and she would correct me whenever I would litter in public places. To become a part of this movement that our prime minister is taking forward is an honour. I feel it is a great initiative and I totally back him on this," said Varun.
