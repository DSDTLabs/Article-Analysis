BENGALURU: Starting next week, a camera-mounted   will keep tabs on   where fire broke out twice this year.

 The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara   ( ) decided to deploy the drone to zero in on the cause of repeated fire accidents in the waterbody. The drone was used to conduct a recce over the lake on Tuesday.
 
 "There is no methane in the lake, so the fire couldn't have been caused by that. Using the drone, we are hoping to monitor the lake and see who is responsible for the incidents. The drone, which will circle the lake twice a day, will be deployed next week," said Sarfaraz Khan, joint-commissioner, health and solid waste management. As per the BDA's action plan submitted to the   on January 29, the BBMP claims to have deployed nine home guards and one   vigilance vehicle besides installing   cameras to secure the waterbody. 
 
 The Palike said it will deploy six more marshalls and another Prahari at the lake. It added that since CCTV cameras were installed only at five places, more will be put up in two more vulnerable areas. The first two measures were to be implemented within a week of the hearing, and the last, within 15 days.
 
 "A few marshalls visited the lake on Tuesday to examine vulnerable spots. Along with the Prahari vehicle, they will be deployed at the lake by next Monday," added Khan.
