PANAJI: The agricultural   in  , Sanguem and Quepem are referred to as the rice bowls of  , while Pernem and Sattari are considered the same for North Goa. But with rising urbanisation, these last stretches of active agricultural land appear to face the danger of being left untilled.

 The Census 2011 data shows that the number of Goa’s population that identifies itself as cultivators is down by around 5,000 since the last Census in 2001. The largest drop in cultivators has been in Pernem — from over 26% during the 2001 census, to a little over 8% in 2011.
 
 Similarly, in 2001, while cultivators made up nearly 55% of Canacona’s population, this figure is down to 40.5% in 2011. 
 
 In Quepem and Sattari, as per Census 2011 data, the cultivator population fell from 27% and 23% in 2001 to 16% and 12%, respectively. The figures are similar in Sanguem and Bicholim talukas. 
 
 Surprisingly, however, data from the Census 2011 indicates that the four highly urbanised talukas of Tiswadi, Salcete, Mormugao and Bardez have witnessed a marginal increase in the cultivator population. 
 
 The overall area under rice cultivation in Goa has gone down by over 1,000 hectares in just the last three years. 
 
 The reason for the drop in cultivators can be observed in the census data, which shows a simultaneous decrease in the number of persons identifying themselves as agricultural labourers. 
 
 Labourers are used for transplanting, plucking, etc, which is is spread over several days. This is followed by weeding out unwanted growth, etc. The process of harvesting and winnowing also requires manual labour, which is usually a problem in the state. 
 
 Officials from the agriculture department point out that other than unavailability of labour for the labour-intensive agriculture work, changing weather parameters, animal attacks are some of the reasons for the decline in the occupation.
