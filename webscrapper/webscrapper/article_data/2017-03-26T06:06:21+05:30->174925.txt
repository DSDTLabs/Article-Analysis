Vadodara: The investigation in the death of  , who died during rioting in Fatehpura in December, was handed over to assistant commissioner of police (G division) A R Patel, following verbal orders by the city police commissioner.

 Sheikh’s brother Munaf had requested a local court that since police inspector M D   police station is respondent in the case, the investigations should be done by some other officer.
 
 Following verbal directions of the CP, Puwar wrote to Patel to take over the investigation. During the last hearing of the petition on March 23, Munaf told the court that in his petition he had made Puwar as one of the respondents so the investigation in the matter should not be done by him.
 
 Puwar was not present during the hearing since he had to go to Kheda court but, he had requested for another date from the court in his written statement. The statement said that the police has sought legal opinion in the matter which will take some time to come.
 
 Munaf had filed a petition in a judicial magistrate’s court on February 8 alleging inaction on the part of the city police after his brother’s death. The court will hold further hearing on April 5.
