Actor   said he was haunted by his own character   from the film  .

 Reportedly, Skarsgard, 27, said the shapeshifting killer clown visited him in his dreams even after they wrapped up the filming of the movie.
 
  
  
 
 "I was home, done with the movie, and I started having very strange and vivid Pennywise dreams. Every night, he came and visited. It was in the shape of either me dealing with him, sort of Pennywise as a separate entity of me, and then also me as Pennywise in circumstances that I didn't appreciate. Like, I'm Pennywise and I'm really upset that I'm out in public and people are looking at me," said Skarsgard.
 
 Explaining the meaning of his dreams, the actor said that "this was a process of letting go of the monster. It was amazing. It's a daunting but exciting thing to sort of revisit him again".
 
 The Swedish actor also said he was so immersed in the role that it was hard to separate the character's depiction from his real attitude. 
 
 "I liken every character that I do to a relationship that you are in. Pennywise and Bill go into this sort of relationship together. I'm trying to figure out who he is and I have to devote so much time and effort to this other person - or thing, in this case - and that goes on for months," said Skarsgard.
 
 The sequel of 'It', a film based on  's novel by the same title, will pick up 27 years later after the first film and is scheduled to be release in September next year.
