GUWAHATI: Despite continued efforts to spread awareness, minor girls, especially in the rural and char areas, remain vulnerable to child marriage in the state. In   district's Boko area, some 60 km from here, at least five minor girls were rescued from being married off last month. 

 In the latest such case, a 13-year-old girl was rescued by Childline's Boko unit and Mandira police station from the   area on Saturday. She had been married off last week. "Her mother-in-law Azirun Bibi was arrested under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act. The groom and others in the family are absconding," said Muklesur  , coordinator of Childline Boko unit.
 
 The victim has been taken to the State Home for Women and Children at Jalukbari here. She will be produced before the Child Welfare Committee ( ) on Wednesday. Rahman said, "We are getting a lot of calls from villagers informing us about child marriages taking place. Verification of these calls in underway with help from village headmen and police."
 
 The high incidence of child marriage in the region has been alarming, rescue officers said. Police sources said several minor girls who had been married off earlier without anyone's knowledge have gone missing or been trafficked.
 
 "There were cases in which minor girls were married off and their husbands took them to New Delhi or Kolkata or Bengaluru, but they never returned. In one of the cases, a girl from the district's Goroimari area was rescued in New Delhi last year, where she was working as a domestic help after her husband left her in the hands of a human trafficking racketeer," police sources said. 
 
 In an effort to address this, the Childline unit has launched a massive awareness campaign in the rural district. Rahman said the unit, in collaboration with the district administration, is going to launch a website which can generate awareness about child welfare and can serve as a platform for people to file their complaints.
