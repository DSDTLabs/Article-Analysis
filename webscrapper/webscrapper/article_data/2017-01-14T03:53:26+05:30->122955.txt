NEW DELHI: Job guarantee scheme   should be focussed more on poor areas where residents figure high on deprivation index, according to an expert committee of the rural development ministry.

 In its report on better targeting of welfare schemes, the   committee has recommended that MGNREGA should be tilted towards regions “where there is a greater concentration of landless labourers or people are suffering from multi-dimensional deprivations, in order to bring about change in the socio-economic landscape of the poor regions of the country”.
 
 The suggestion seeks to recalibrate the job scheme instead of letting it follow a uniform approach irrespective of development gaps between regions.
 
 According to the committee, the  , which aid the scheme’s implementation, should be strengthened to better capture the demand for work in panchayats with higher concentration of “deprived households” and “landless manual labour”.
 
 For observers, the recommendation is interesting as it treads the risky territory where it could be seen as seeking to limit the job scheme to poor areas by cutting out blocks identified as developed.
 
 MGNREGA does not follow any exclusion criteria based on development index. Acontroversy erupted during the first year of   government when then rural development minister   led a discussion on limiting the job scheme to 2,500 under-developed blocks.
 
 Coming out against the move, social activists argued the job scheme was demanddriven and universal. As the Centre backed out, the scheme stayed in its normal format.
 
 The Bose panel has taken care to observe that since MGNREGA is demand-driven and universal, poverty indicators cannot be used to exclude beneficiaries. Observers said the panel’s caveat is aimed at ensuring that its advice does not create an impression that the government may exclude regions from the scheme’s ambit.
