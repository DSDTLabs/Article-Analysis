 Former director-general of prosecution T Asaf Ali said that a case can be registered under clause (ii) and (iv) sub-section 1 of the   section 354A for demanding sexual favours as well making sexually-coloured remarks, even if the woman involved does not register a complaint against the ex-minister.

 Former additional director-general of prosecution K I Abdul Rasheed said there was enough material to file an FIR but the case will become complicated at the evidence stage, if no complainant came forward. He said that the case will not stand if the woman or someone in her place does not file a complaint against the ex-minister for sexual harassment.
