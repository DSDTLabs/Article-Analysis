BATIM:   Francis Silveira joined his St Cruz counterpart in announcing his resignation from   (GPPDA) at a noisy meeting, stating that he would back the struggle against the inclusion of villages into it.

 The announcement came amidst chaos and confusion at the Batim panchayat hall at a meeting, which had been convened on Wednesday by Silveira to explain the PDA plan dynamics. But villagers from Curca-Bambolim-Talaulim, Batim, Azossim-Mandur, among others, in the packed hall kept up a continuous chorus of “Amkam naka PDA” (We don’t want PDA).
 
 Silveira, who couldn’t speak much in the din, expressed his gratitude to the voters for choosing him as their MLA. “If you don’t want it (PDA), I don’t want it,” he quipped.
 
 Further, he said the fight would be to get the PDA denotified. St Cruz MLA, Tony Fernandes had resigned on February 18 at a rally against PDAs. Silveira was, earlier, booed as he entered the hall. 
 
 When he began to speak, there was an uproar, as the crowd kept chanting “Scrap the PDA. We don’t want PDA.” He said that he had invited elected representatives of seven panchayats and parish priests from his constituency for the presentation by PDA officials. “Let us try to understand it,” he said. But, some activists said they had only a single-point agenda - axing of the PDA.
 
 Rama Kankonkar, while appreciating Silveira’s gesture said that resignation alone would not serve the purpose. The matter has to be followed up and it may entail a legal battle, too. Curca-Bambolim-Talaulim deputy sarpanch Marvin Gonsalves said that the affected villagers will hold a public meeting in Panaji and invite town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai for it on April 7.
