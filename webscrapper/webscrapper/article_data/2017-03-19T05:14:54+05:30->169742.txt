KOLKATA: Seventy years after Independence, India's visually challenged will finally know what the Indian map is like, with the National Atlas & Thematic Mapping Organisation (Natmo), a central government undertaking under the department of science & technology , preparing an atlas of the country in  .

 “There is a lot of excitement, in our organisation and more so in schools for the blind, to see the expression of students when they lay their hands on the atlas,“ said Natmo director  .
 
 The launch of the Braille atlas is an emotional moment for Banerjee and her team as the initiative had begun two decades ago. Natmo had first prepared it on a sheet of metal but the experiment flopped as children called to test it did not like the feel. It was then attempted on a vinyl board.Once again, it was rejected.
 
 Finally , Natmo returned to paper. When the maps were given to some boys from the   with Visual Disabilities, their faces lit up. “You could tell the joy they felt,“ said Banerjee.
 
 
 
 
 Visually impaired PwC executive   used a tablet with a map-based software to learn the locations of states, but can't wait to check out the Braille map. “I have a rough idea of India. It will be great to experience the Braille atlas,“ he added.
 
 He is excited about the fact that the different maps in the atlas will help him understand the Indian topography in all its vagaries.
 
 The atlas explains physical features like plains, mountains and rivers through lines of varying thickness. Each line will be referenced with text in Braille. Experts in the field have lauded the initiative, but also offered suggestions.
 
 “Some of the textures that differentiate various features, like plains and hills, need to be made more prominent. The gap between the Braille dots also needs to be reduced,“ said Biswajit Ghosh, principal of Narendrapur Ramakrisna Mission Blind Boys' Academy.
