JAIPUR: The   has directed   to make   from the upcoming  . The department says that color of the uniform should be decided by the college administration in association with students’ unions. The state has 148 government colleges, including 15 law colleges.

 Kiran Maheshwari, higher education minister, told TOI, “The move intends to bring uniformity in colleges. A dress code will bring a sense of togetherness, discipline and identification of a student.” Pointing to engineering and management college students or private university students who follow a dress code, she said the government college students too must have the same.
 
 The department has given the freedom to respective colleges to take a call on the type of dress. “The state will not interfere in deciding the dress code and the task of deciding the same will rest on the principals of the colleges,” she said.
 
 She argued that the demand for dress code had come from students during the Shikshak-Chattra Samvad program, initiated by the department.
 
 “Many college students have requested their teachers and principals for a dress code. It’s being implemented keeping the sentiments of students in mind,” said Maheswari. The department had directed government colleges in Alwar on a pilot basis to have a dress code from January 1, but none of them implemented it. The college administration says such changes can be done only from the start of an academic session.
 
 When TOI called up some principals they said that they have not received any such order but favoured the idea of a dress code. A principal of a government college in Jaipur says the dress code has become very important as most of the students come from rural areas.
 
 “Casual dresses give an impression of your social status and lead to class differences which may sometime turn into discrimination,” said a principal of a government college in Jaipur.
