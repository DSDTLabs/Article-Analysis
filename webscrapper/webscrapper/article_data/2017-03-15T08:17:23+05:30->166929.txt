LUCKNOW: The group of suspected   arrested recently had three   associated with city-based educational institutes on their target. 

 An officer handling the investigation said the group of youths saw anyone who did not believe in the Salafi movement as their enemy, be it Hindus, Muslims or members of other communities. One terror suspect was killed by   in Thakurganj, Lucknow, on March 8 after a 12-gun battle.
 
 They tried more attacks, but failed.
 
 The six terror suspects arrested from Kanpur who allegedly tried to orchestrate acts of terror in UP and MP were desperate to trigger bombings, ATS officials said.
 
 “Thankfully, the group did not find dangerous explosive material and tried to make bombs only with gunpowder,” said IG ATS Asim Arun.
