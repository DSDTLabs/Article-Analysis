 will be seen in a cameo in Imtiaz Ali’s ' ' (JHMS). The actress, ecstatic to be associated with a much-awaited film that stars   and  , got to speak her mother tongue (German) in a Hindi film for the first time. She reveals, “Even if it’s a two-minute role, I’m thrilled to have worked with Shah Rukh sir and Imtiaz. I grew up in Germany, near Frankfurt. Life came a full circle when I got a chance to speak my mother tongue in JHMS. I had an opportunity to be myself.” What makes Evelyn’s role even more special is the way she bagged it. The actress had never met Imtiaz before they met on a flight to Udaipur. “We got talking and he mentioned how Ranbir Kapoor (who happens to be his friend) appreciated my work in 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'. Imtiaz was also penning the script of JHMS on the plane. When he learnt that I could speak German fluently, he asked me if I could help him with a few lines in German (SRK speaks the lines in the film as a tourist guide). I was happy to help. A week after this, I was delighted to get an opportunity to be in the film for a cameo,” she recalls with a smile. Evelyn also became a fan of Shah Rukh’s toddler AbRam while shooting for this film. “I love children and AbRam is such a well-mannered, well-raised little boy,” she says, adding, “He is as adorable and talkative as his father.”
