HYDERABAD: After decoy operations, doctors at a hospital and a scanning centre were caught red-handed by a 20-member team for conducting sex-determination tests. The hospital at   and scanning centre in   were sealed and criminal cases under Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act were booked against them by district health authorities on Wednesday.

 Massive decoy operations were in last one week, after HC pulled up health authorities and police over a video submitted against Gayathri Nursing Home.
 
 Apart from a doctor and two nurses, two   workers who were doing part-time job at the hospital were removed from ASHA duty on charges of colluding with the hospital and scanning centre to conduct pre-natal diagnostic techniques.
 
 Dr IA  , in-charge  , said: “The two women (ASHA workers) took the woman to scanning centre in Yousufguda which was 5-6 kilometres away from the hospital, despite many scanning centres in the vicinity. The scanning centre was being run in a secretive manner.”
