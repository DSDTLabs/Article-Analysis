GAYA: The Bodh   businessman and the district administration have hardened their stand on the new traffic arrangements with prolonged negotiations between them on the issue failing on Thursday evening.

 Whereas the representatives of residents and shopkeepers went ahead with their proposed three-day bandh from Friday,   Garima   warned them of serious action, including arrest, in case they violated the law and created trouble. 
 
 On their part, several hundred bandh supporters took out a torchlight procession and marched through the streets. There were also reports of minor scuffle between the cops and the protesters.
 
 Entry of all kinds of four-wheelers has been banned in a radius of about one km of the Mahabodhi Temple, the seat of Buddha's enlightenment, as it figures prominently on the terrorist radar. The ban, also imposed for environmental reasons, came into effect on February 20. 
 
 Initially two-wheelers, motorised as well as non-motorised, were also covered under the ban. However, the authorities later exempted two-wheelers provided the vehicles were not parked in the prohibited zone. Only limited number of e-rickshaws are to be allowed to ply in the restricted zone.
 
 According to SSP Malik, who along with DM Abhishek Singh held talks with the bandh supporters, a major concession was offered as the administration agreed to relax the new rules and allow vehicles carrying business and other essential items to enter the restricted zone between 9pm and and 5am.
 
 The bandh supporters, according to the SSP, rejected the offer. “Having offered that relaxation, we will now not tolerate any bid to disrupt law and order in the name of opposing the new traffic arrangement,” said the SSP.
