HYDERABAD: In spite of municipal administration and urban development Minister   stating that no one would be spared for defacing property or putting up illegal flexies, TRS corporator from   has allegedly gotten away with putting up flexis welcoming animal husbandry minister   for a local programme.

 The civic staff have been on a special drive removing unauthorised flexies and posters across the city following directions from the High Court. While they have so far removed over 7.05 lakh unauthorised flexies and levied penalties, those in power seem to be exempt. 
 
 Sources said when GHMC staff came across the flexies with Yadavâ€™s photo, they decided to remove them and impose a fine of Rs 10,000. But when they realised a ruling party corporator was involved, they backtracked.
 
 On being asked why the corporator was not fined, officials on the condition anonymity said they had no clarity regarding who had put up the posters. "It could even be her husband or other supporters. We can only levy penalty after we find out who is responsible for them," said an official.
 
 When contacted, GHMC Additional Commissioner (health and sanitation) Ravi Kiran outrightly denied any corporator being involved in the matter saying the row emerged from a rumour. "No corporator was levied a fine in the first place for it to be backtracked," he said.
 
 GHMC Commissioner  , for his part, said he was not aware about the issue but said there were clear instructions from the KTR not to spare any one. KTR has been very particular about the issue and even got his own posters, erected by supporters on the occasion of his birthday, removed from in front of the TRS Bhavan. 
 
 While Hemalatha did not answer repeated phone calls, Talasani, denied having any knowledge of the felxies. "I am not aware of the issue. It will take some time for all corporators, local politicians and supporters to understand that it is a crime to deface the city," he said.
