NEW DELHI: Three days after the   announced revised minimum wages, the high court on Tuesday partially stayed its operation.

 A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal directed the government “not to take any coercive action” in the matter and decided to examine the validity of the decision next week.
 
 On March 3, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal approved the government’s decision to hike the minimum wages of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers by about 37%. The Bill proposes a penalty of Rs 50,000 and a jail term up to 3 years for violation of the provisions. At present, the penalty is Rs 500 while jail term is six months.
 
 HC acted on an application moved by Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a city based traders body, which had challenged AAP government’s decision last year on the ground that it lacked LG’s approval and violated Section 9 of Minimum Wages Act.
 
 They argued that instead of giving representation to employers on the committee set up to revise the minimum wages, the government put officials of DMRC and PWD on the panel that toed its line. It sought an immediate stay on the government decision arguing that it “involves the future of Delhi industry being put to dark by attitude of AAP government to gain political mileage at the cost of abnormal proposed increase of wages.”
 
 Dubbing the hike in wages as “historic” and “highest” in independent India, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last week said a notification for its implementation will be issued on March 6.
