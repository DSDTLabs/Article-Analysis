CHANDIGARH: Though AAP fell well short of its own expectation in Punjab assembly elections, Dalits in the state seem to be the main support base of the party.

 Of the 20 seats that AAP bagged in Punjab, nine are reserved seats.
 
 Of the 117 assembly constituencies in Punjab, 34 are reserved. While riding Amarinder wave, the Congress has more than doubled its tally from 10 of 2012 assembly elections to 21 this time.
 
 Even then, AAP has managed to directly snatch four SC seats that had swung the Congress way in 2012.
 
 What's more, the seats won by the   party are not part of the parliamentary seats which it had won in the 2014 election --Faridkot, Fathegarh Sahib, Sangrur and Patiala.
 
 The latest results show it has won Budhlada in Mansa district; Jaitu and Bathinda Rural in Bathinda; Mehal Kalan and Bhadaur in Barnala; Raikot and Jagraon in Ludhiana; and Nihal Singhwala in Moga.
 
 In November end, AAP had announced a separate Dalit manifesto directly targeting the 32% population of the state.
 
 Kejriwal had himself addressed over 95 rallies in Punjab over the past few month and though the party's vote share still fell since the 2014 election (the party did not exist at the time of the 2012 Punjab assembly elections), it seems to have found a set of core voters.
