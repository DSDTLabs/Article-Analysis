PANAJI: Deputy collector   will shortly commence an inquiry to ascertain whether lands, on which the golf course project at   is proposed, were tenanted as of November 1990. 

 This development came in a petition filed before the high court of Bombay at Goa filed by Goa Foundation, St Anthony’s mundkar and tenant association, Tiracol, and others challenging clearances and approvals to the project issued by town and country planning (TCP) department and Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB). 
 
 While the high court division bench reserved its order in the matter after conclusion of arguments in the public interest litigation (PIL), the verdict is expected to be delivered within a week’s time. 
 
 On Tuesday, advocate general   informed the court about the recommendation of   deputy collector Agnelo Fernandes’ name for the inquiry. 
 
 The court accepted it and sources said the inquiry is likely to be completed within five months. 
 
 The petitioners had stated in their plea that the tenanted part of the land admeasuring 11,27,097 sqm out of the total land area of Tiracol village of 13,84,000sqm constituted 90%. 
 
 As per the the Goa Land Use (Regulation) Act, 1991, which was effective from November 1990, any land that is tenanted cannot be diverted for purposes other than agriculture. 
 
 The main reliefs sought by the petitioners were seeking cancellation of the sale deed that transferred land to Leading Hotels and quashing the permission granted by statutory authorities for the project.
