SURAT: Demonetization has severely affected Surat textile trade. Sale of saris and dress materials has gone down significantly this marriage season with traders suffering loss up to 30%. 

 Manoj Agarwal, president of Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA) said, “There is no sale on the retail front. Garments like dress material and saris are last on the priority list. Those who have marriages in their families also spend minimum on saris.”
 
 He further said that traders from south India, who account for more than 25% of sales, too are not buying the material. “Traders from south are buying less since Diwali due to cash crunch and the same is the case with traders from Delhi and   who have heavy demand for our dress material. Their orders have also gone down by 50%,” added Agarwal. 
 
 Surat with 165 textile markets, mostly spread around Ring Road, has 65,000 shops and according to an estimate average business per day is Rs 100 crore.
 
 Kamal Vijay Tulsiyan, a textile processor and president of   said, “Normally, Surat produces 4 to 5 lakh metres of cloth everyday, but these days production is only 50%. The main reason for that is no one buys in bulk and stores it in godowns these days. Traders from across the country who come to Surat and buy saris and dress material are buying as per their daily requirements.” 
 
 The trade during marriage season this year nearly halved 50% of the normal as there are questions over availability of cash.
