MUMBAI: The state government has decided to make it mandatory for all upcoming industries to employ 80% local staff. 

 The state industries department, which is in the process of revising its industrial policy, said this clause would be included in the MoU itself instead of merely serving as a guideline. Officials say the new policy would incentivize job creation instead of investments. 
 
 Officials from the department said they would make it mandatory for industrial investors and corporates which have signed MoUs with the state government to provide 80% jobs to locals if they wanted to avail benefits and tax incentives.
 
 "There are certain guidelines on  , but they are merely guidelines. We are planning to include it in the legal document itself," said the official.
 
 The official said it would be also made mandatory for these industries to source a certain percentage of raw material from small and medium enterprises in the area where the business is set up.
 
 Officials said the new policy will also make it mandatory to audit employment generation to ensure incentives are given to those who follow the rules.
