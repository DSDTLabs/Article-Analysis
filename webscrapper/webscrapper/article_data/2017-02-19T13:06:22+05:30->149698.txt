' ' actor   is thrilled for his short film, based on Rajiv and  's love story.
 
  The talented actor is producing as well as starring in his movie ' '.
  
  Karanvir Bohra will be seen playing the role of late Prime Minister   while actress Priya Banerjee who was last seen in the movie 'Jazbaa', will be seen as Sonia Gandhi.
  
  
 
  
  In the first look, Karanvir and Priya re-created an old photograph of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi enjoying ice-cream from a ice-cream vendor near India Gate. 
  
  
  While talking about 'Ijazat', Karanvir said, “It's tribute to Sonia and Rajiv Ji love story, but it's is fiction, and has no political agenda. It is a simple story which is made to create a different content for audience. I've always been fascinated with classic love stories of the 50's and the 60's. They don't write such stories or make such movies anymore. I came across Rendezvous with Simi Garewal with late Mr Rajiv Gandhi ji and was so mesmerized by the way he spoke and the way he carried himself with such elegance. The way he would speak about Sonia Gandhi ji, the way they met and how he geared up the courage to ask permission to his mother....The Prime Minister then, Mrs Indira Gandhiji. That’s where my film ends. They call it the Eric Segal love story of India. It’s my tribute to him and to all the people in love. A reaffirmation that TRUE LOVE DOES EXISTS” says Karanvir
  
  The film is a tribute to Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi and will be in English and Italian.
  
  The first look is promising and we cannot wait for the film already.
