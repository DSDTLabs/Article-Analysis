GUWAHATI: A CBI court here on Tuesday sent four persons, including two income tax officers of the state - commissioner of income tax (audit) for Guwahati and Jorhat, Swetabh Suman and income tax officer (audit)   - to three days of remand for further quizzing. CBI had arrested the four persons last Friday for their alleged involvement in a criminal conspiracy to provide undue favour to a Jorhat trader,  , by passing a favourable order in an appeal arising out of assessment done in respect of one of  's company.

 
  said, "CBI has also sought permission from the court to collect their voice samples for further investigation and to corroborate them with some incriminating phone calls. The court will take up the prayer on April 20." The investigating agency wants to match the voice samples with the phone calls as this will be concrete evidence of their offence.
 
 Meanwhile another accused,  , a chartered account, was also nabbed by CBI but could not be produced before the court as the accused was reported to be sick. Sources said the other accused, Agarwalla, is currently not in the country.
 
 CBI conducted multiple raids across the state after it registered a case against the two income tax officials and several others for allegedly hatching a criminal conspiracy to evade huge tax dues. Raids were conducted in Guwahati, Jorhat, Nagaon, Shillong, Noida, Delhi and some other places linked to a private firm under the scanner. Some incriminating documents and Rs 40 lakh suspected to be meant for the accused IT officials were also seized from a middleman.
 
 "During 2017-18, Suman was involved in a criminal conspiracy with his colleague Das and the others to provide undue favour to Agarwalla. Suman even made attempts to obtain illegal gratification of Rs 50 lakh for himself and Das through two CAs," sources said.
