BENGALURU:   president   on Tuesday said that he will become the Prime Minister if his party emerges as the single largest among all its coalition partners in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 
 "If the Congress party is the biggest party, yes," said Rahul to a question on his PM aspiration during an interaction with prominent personalities in Bengaluru as part of the launch of Samruddhi Bharat conference here.
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Rahul also said the BJP would not win the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and even Prime Minister   might lose from Varanasi as he will not be able to face a 'united' Opposition. "The BJP will not get more than five seats in UP alone. The recent bypolls in UP has already exhibited the strength of collective opposition," he added.
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Talking about women empowerment in politics, Rahul said he wants to see at least ten women chief ministers in the country from the Congress in the next ten years. "I know, my statement will annoy many men here, mainly senior leaders, but that is the agenda I am going to set," he said, adding that he wasn't impressed by Karnataka Congress to give just a dozen tickets to women in the assembly polls.
