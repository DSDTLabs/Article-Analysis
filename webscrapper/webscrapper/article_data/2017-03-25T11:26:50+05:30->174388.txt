When a handful of actors, producers and technicians joined hands to make the film 'Take Off' a while back, they had decided that it would be given their best, as it's made in memory of their friend  .

 Actor Kunchacko Boban, who played the male lead in the movie, is quite overwhelmed by how the film, which released yesterday, has turned out. He wrote on his social media page a while ago, " film which has "A RAJESH PILLAI FILM" stamped all over it. Because director Mahesh knew what kind of a film would Rajesh love to do.And no wonder that in the way how "TRAFFIC "changed the course of Malayalam Movies,"TAKE OFF" took
 Malayalam movies to another level."
 
 The artiste thanked everyone who stood with the project, for which he took no remuneration. "Thanking each and everyone who appreciated,accepted,promoted "TAKE OFF" not just for the sake of Rajesh Pillai,but on the merit of the film that it deserved.
 Proud and happy that i was there in both TRAFFIC and TAKE OFF,doing pivotal roles and the movie lovers acknowledging the ACTOR in KUNCHACKO BOBAN. Because Rajesh was the one who made me realize and exploited the art of acting through TRAFFIC and VETTAH, two of my characters dearer to me."
 
 Kunchacko says that he could feel the presence of the late filmmaker Rajesh with him, while working for 'Take Off.' "Rajesh Pillai was there to make SHAHID,one of the best roles in my career spanning 76 movies and 20 glorious years. I thank MAHESH and MEGHA for making this wonderful movie to take off, Anto Joseph and Shebin Backer to spread its wings and the wonderful cast & crew for it to soar higher," he said.
