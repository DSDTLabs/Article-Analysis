AHMEDABAD: Even as   this summer due to low water availability from  ,   have requested the state government to maintain 50% of water supply allocated to them to avoid adverse impact on the industries.

 “We have written to the chief minister Vijay Rupani requesting him to ask the authorities concerned to maintain at least 50% of the allocated water supply to the Kutch industries,” said Nimish Phadke, managing director,   (FOKIA).
 
 The industry body has also sought a meeting with the chief minister to represent the difficulties to be faced by the industries if water supply is stopped.
 
 “Kutch industrial units get 90 million litres per day (MLD) water from the state government. Out of this, we get 25%-35% less supply even in normal circumstances. The government should provide at least 45 MLD water supply in the event of water shortage in the state,” said an industry source.
 
 As many as 250 large and medium industrial units apart from 3,000 small and micro units operate in Kutch district. Their total water requirement is 300 MLD. While 90 MLD supply comes from the government, the remaining requirement is met through captive desalination plants, sewerage treatment plants and other sources.
 
 If water supply is halted, then the industrial units will have to bear huge production and financial losses. The foreign earnings could also take a hit if exports commitments are not honoured. Several units in the Kutch are export oriented, FOKIA stated in its letter to the state government.
 
 The industries in Kutch have also prepared a water security plan suggesting measures to improve water availability and supply. The association has also requested the state government to adopt the plan and ask each stakeholder to perform the assigned roles for bringing permanent water supply solution to agriculture, drinking and industries in the entire Kutch district.
