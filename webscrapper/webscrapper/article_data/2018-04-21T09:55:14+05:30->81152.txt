CHANDIGARH: The slight drizzle on Friday did nothing to clear the air, which was filled with dust in the windswept Tricity. In the day, level of rainfall was recorded at 0.3mm and 1mm near the airport. As the sun made an occasional appearance through the rain clouds, the evening turned humid. By twilight, it was pleasant as the mercury slid down a few notches.

 According to Chandigarh meteorological department, clouds are here to stay till Saturday. Commuters had a tough time early on Friday as struggled with dust in their eyes. Later, the drizzle caught those on two-wheelers on the wrong foot. Rain forced commuters to stop at almost every bus stop for shelter.
 
 Those allergic to dust faced health problems, especially after a trip outdoors. “I am allergic to dust, which is what I breathed in till I reached my office in Sector 9. I kept all the windows closed but still felt a tightness in the chest. The weather has been horrible since morning,” said  , a government employee.
 
 Students who had to go to college for tests and viva found themselves in trouble. Manjusha, a student of SD college in Sector 32 said, “I had my viva but it started raining and I was late to college. Later, I had to cancel shopping plans as it was very humid. But I am happy about the respite from heat.”
 
 Vishal Vashisht, a theatre artist said, “We have a play scheduled at   on Saturday and we decided to give last touches to the set and props but the rainfall and wind ruined everything. We will now have to start afresh early in the morning.”
 
 Clouds brought respite from the sun but not from the heat during the day as maximum temperature dropped only by a few notches.
