Surat: The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) is preparing to issue final show cause notice to fugitive Nirav Modi and his uncle  , asking them to remain present in person before the council in connection with its independent inquiry into the Rs 12,000 crore fraud that they allegedly carried out in the Punjab National Bank’s Mumbai branch. 

 This will be the third notice to be issued by the council since February when the multi-crore banking scam was unearthed. Industry sources said both Modi and Choksi have been members of the GJEPC for a long time. Choksi had even held the position of chairman of the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (FICCI) gems and jewellery committee and been a member of the GJEPC’s diamond panel committee. 
 
 The first show cause notice to Modi and Choksi in February did not elicit any explanation from them. Again, a second notice was issued to them on March 7, which also went unanswered. 
 
 “We will be issuing third and final notice to Modi and Choksi. This notice will ask both to remain present in person before the council. If they do not present themselves before the council, we will approach our disciplinary committee and begin the process of suspending them from the council. Suspending a member is bound by legalities and the entire process will be handled swiftly,” GJEPC regional chairman Dinesh Navadiya said.
 
 Sources said GJEPC has also submitted suggestions to the government on how to make stringent norms to avoid any financial irregularities in the industry in future. 
 
 “We are seeking the advice from various departments, including commerce, finance and banking, on how to strengthen the process of avoiding fraudulent practices in the industry. The recent action by the Reserve Bank of India banning the LoUs is only going to affect genuine people doing ethical business. The banks should not act in haste,” Navadiya added.
