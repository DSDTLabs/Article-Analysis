IMPHAL: As   hots up, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend two BJP rallies in the state next week. 

 Former Union minister and BJP leader Thounoujam Chaoba Singh called on Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday and discussed with him the party's strategies to overthrow Congress.
 
 "Our meeting lasted around 30 minutes. I requested Modi ji to address two election rallies - one in Imphal and the other in   headquarters - next week and he agreed," Chaoba told this reporter. 
 
 "Modi also took into account our request to announce the party's chief ministerial candidate," Chaoba, chairman of the party's election management committee, said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP has issued its third and final list of two candidates; one of them is Krishna Kumar Singh, the younger brother of Congress strongman and state industries minister K Govindas. He will contest from Bishnupur seat. The other candidate on the list is former minister S Rajen Singh who will fight from Lamsang constituency in   district. With its third list out, BJP, like Congress, has named candidates for all 60 assembly seats.
 
 "I'm so grateful to BJP leaders for giving me a ticket," a jubilant Krishna Kumar said. An alumnus of   Imphal and a renowned entrepreneur, the 51-year-old lives apart from his minister brother at Ningthoukhong Bazaar located on the northern side of the picturesque Loktak Lake.
 
 "From tomorrow (Wednesday), I will start campaigning in my constituency in a phased manner," he said.
 
 In the meantime, a large number of ticket aspirants who were denied a chance to contest the polls by either Congress and BJP continued to move to other parties like North East India Development Party, Manipur National Democratic front and National People's Party.
