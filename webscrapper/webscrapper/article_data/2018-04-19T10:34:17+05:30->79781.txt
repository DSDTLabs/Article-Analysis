CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday assured the Madras   that   of Class X, and Class XII   will not be delayed in view of the strike announced by government teachers, and that results would be declared as scheduled.

 Special government pleader C Munusamy also submitted that appropriate action would be taken against school teachers, who absent themselves during the evaluation process.
 
 The submissions were made on a plea moved by a Class XII student, Narmadha, seeking such assurance from the government. 
 
 Recording the submissions, Justice S   ordered notice to the authorities and Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School PG Teachers Associations and posted the next hearing to April 24. 
 
 Pointing out that results of Class X and Class XII board exams might be delayed this year since teacher associations boycotted the evaluation process, pressing for their demands pertaining to pension scheme and pay, Narmadha wanted the court to interfere and direct the government to ensure declaration of results as scheduled.
 
 In her petition, Narmadha claimed that each and every day of boycott would result in serious delay in completion of the evaluation process, and if the evaluation was not completed as per the schedule, it would result in postponement of announcement of results. Such postponement would seriously impact the students, leaving them not able to apply for higher education within the deadlines stipulated by the colleges and universities, she added.
