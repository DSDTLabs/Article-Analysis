NAVI MUMBAI: The much discussed goods and services tax ( ) has been haunting Durga idol makers this year. 

 With Durga puja only a fortnight away, idol makers across the city and Mumbai are an unhappy lot. They took orders for making the idols from various puja associations in March-April when GST was yet to be imposed. But from July onwards, they have been shelling out more to procure their raw materials as most of them have become costlier due to GST levied on them.
 
  “With GST levied on clay, straw, bamboo, nails, paints, artificial hair, fabrics and jewellery, we have to pay more for them. The actual cost has soared many time over what we quoted six months before,” said senior murtikar Viswanath Pal. 
 
 “ But the organisers are not ready to increase the price and idol makers like us have to bear the brunt,” lamented Pal, who has been making idols for Mumbai as well as city puja associations for over two decades. 
 
 Rasaraj Pal from Panvel idol making center said, “Despite a steep fall in the profit margin, we are trying hard to adjust and doing our best to sell our idols.”
 
 Another artisan, Shivdas Pal from Vashi added, “Apart from that, a three-fold increase in labour cost has nearly crippled us. We need plenty of helping hands at this point of time to finish the work on time and these workers, too, are demanding a lot more.” 
 
 Even the recent GST relief on finished idol (from 12% to 0) will not help the idol makers. In fact, this will eat more into their profits, since the benefit is just for the buyer, said the murtikars who have to wait another year to adjust prices.
