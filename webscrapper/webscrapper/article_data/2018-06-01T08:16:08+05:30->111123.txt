 R H Junakiya, the secretary of Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board said, “The students lack basic knowledge of English language. Secondly, a majority of the students who failed in English are those from rural areas, which do not have facilities like in cities.”
 
  an English teacher said, “The government in 2004 introduced English communication. Student who cannot speak all 26 alphabet are made to answer English communication paper. I feel that the short messaging services (SMS) has been responsible for the deteriorating English standards. Students used to SMS fumble when writing long sentences.”
