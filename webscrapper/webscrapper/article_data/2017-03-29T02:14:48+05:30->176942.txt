GURUGRAM: Two   of   in Gwalpahari — Vaishali Rana Chandra and Sharmila Kaushik — moved the National Green Tribunal after all their efforts to pursue the district administration and MCG to conduct a fresh demarcation of   (drain) near their condominium failed.

 They say the nullah, which enters Gurgaon at Gwalpahari and passes through Baliyawas and Ghata before emptying into the Badshapur drain, has been encroached upon by two private developers, blocking natural flow of water.
 
 The residents say if the nullah is not freed of encroachments soon, it could lead to a rerun of Gurujam this monsoon. According to them, the district authorities are turning a blind eye to the problem and have not yet initiated a fresh demarcation of the nullah, despite an order from the director of land records (DLR) in Panchkula.
 
 Five   have been done in the past two years. Based on a demarcation done in April 2015, one of the private builders was asked to stop construction activity for a year as three of its buildings were found to be right on the nullah.
 
 However, the residents say, based on a “fallacious” demarcation done last year, construction activities on the bed of the nullah resumed. But after residents raised an objection, the DLR ordered the Gurgaon deputy commissioner in August last year to get a fresh demarcation done. “While a big hue and cry is made by the local administration about preservation of natural drains so that flooding does not take place in the city, sadly there is total inertia on their part. For the past two years, we have been fighting to save this nullah, but still the construction right on its bed continues unabated,” said Chandra and Kaushik.
 
 Deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh said he was not aware of the direction to conduct a fresh demarcation of the drain. MCG officials said they have been not yet been able to look into the matter so far.
