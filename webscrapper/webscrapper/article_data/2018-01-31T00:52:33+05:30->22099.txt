NEW DELHI: The municipal   have decided   any   from   in   as mentioned in Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Rules approved by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal recently.

 The policy drafted by the transport department of Delhi government suggests that parking charges in residential areas will be decided by the local bodies in consultation with the residents’ welfare associations.
 
 A senior official from south corporation said, “The decision to charge parking fees is up to the local bodies. For now, no parking charges will be collected from residential colonies. For commercial areas, the parking fee will vary depending on the volume of traffic.”
 
 The corporation, however, has decided to demarcate specific zones in residential areas for parking vehicles. “We will demarcate the parking areas to ensure that no traffic problems occur,” the official added.
 
 Senior officials added that a committee is yet to finalise the base parking rates. “We will study the policy and the base rates will be finalised by the House. The policy will be sent for notification after that,” said south mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat.
 
 Delhi government had on Monday published the draft notification of the rules, inviting suggestions and objections from the public within 30 days. The policy discourages on-street and long-duration parking. There are provisions for double parking charges for on-street parking, which will increase exponentially after the first hour along with peak and off-peak hour charges.
 
 The rules also suggest charges for night parking on roads in residential areas. Households may not be allowed to park more than three cars on roads at night. Local bodies were also told to consider allowing parking based on the size of a plot.
