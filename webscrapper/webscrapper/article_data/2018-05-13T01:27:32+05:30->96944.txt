NEW DELHI: Almost in the last leg of the 14-day anti-encroachment   — led by the special task force — the three civic bodies focussed on clearing areas and roads around railway stations, metro stations and bus stops on Saturday.

 The north civic body cleared areas surrounding Old and New Delhi railway stations along with several stretches near metro stations such as Dilli Gate, Munirka and Jhandewalan.
 
 The South Delhi Municipal Corporation demolished a total of 119 structures, clearing 15km-long stretches on Saturday alone. TOI accompanied a SDMC team, which undertook a drive third time on the same Vivekananda Marg stretch and Church Road of RK Puram. Similarly, the north corporation too, has carried out drives thrice at DB Gupta Road where encroachers keep coming back. An area of around 6km was cleared during the drive at RK Puram and five vehicles, 15 articles such as counters, cylinders, cubicles etc were seized and 34 temporary structures demolished.
 
 Civic officials said that unless the local police officials are held responsible to prevent encroachers from returning — as mandated under Supreme Court orders — such drives won’t have long-term impact.
 
 “In central zone encroachment removal action was taken at the Kalindi Kunj Road, where 20 permanent structures were demolished. While in west zone action was taken at   traffic light on both sides of   to Dwarka, from Chaukhandi Road to Subzi Mandi. During this, 17 vehicles were seized and 43 extended portions demolished,” spokesperson of the south corporation said.
 
 An illegal subzi mandi in Najafgarh was removed and 325sqm land retrieved with the help of JCBs. Corporations are now targeting the repeat offenders by delaying release of the seized items.
 
 The north civic body said it cleared 8km road in its six zones on Saturday and impounded 26 vehicles and 80 items. The east corporation too, carried out demolition action at Chand Mohalla, Bhola Nath Nagar and Geeta Colony.
