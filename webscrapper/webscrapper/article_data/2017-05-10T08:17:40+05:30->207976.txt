THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has ordered a   after students, who wrote NEET on Sunday, complained that they were ill-treated by on-duty security  

 On Tuesday, chief minister   informed the assembly that the complaint filed by a student of Kannur, who said that she was compelled to remove her top innerwear before writing the exam, will be investigated by the police along with those filed by other students. Some students had complained that the frisking team at exam venue had forced them to remove metal buttons and cut shirt sleeves before writing the exam.
 
 Vijayan, while replying to a submission moved by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, said women sub-inspectors will visit complainants and record their statements as part of the probe. “There is a complaint from a woman candidate at Kuruppampady St Mary’s school, Ernakulam, that she couldn’t write exam because of restrictions. That will also be probed,” said the chief minister.
 
 Empathizing with the students who had to undergo ordeal on exam day, Vijayan said that during exam day, students would be tensed even if they wrote it in their own school. “When it is another school, the mental strain increases. The impact of such restrictions (on students) will be huge,” he said.
 
 Chennithala said the illogical directives of CBSE was the root cause of the issue. “The frisking was done in such a manner to demoralize candidates and create fear. In other countries, students are provided counselling ahead of exams. Here we suffocate them with cruel, anti-human rules,” he said. Vijayan replied that the inconvenience caused by the unscientific guidelines will be conveyed to the Union government.
