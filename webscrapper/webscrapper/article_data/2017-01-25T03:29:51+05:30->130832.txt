NEW DELHI: Former MLA and BJP leader   on Tuesday filed a criminal defamation case against chief minister   and other  .

 Tanwar filed it in Patial House courts and said he had arraigned Dilip Pandey, Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan, and Delhi Cantt MLA Surender Singh for their statements linking him to the murder of NDMC legal officer M M Khan. Tanwar is NDMC vice chairman. 
 
 The case is listed for hearing on March 18, Tanwar informed in a press statement. 
 
 Khan was shot dead in Jamia Nagar on May 16, 2016, and AAP leaders have been demanding the arrest of East Delhi MP Maheish Girri and Tanwar ever since. Delhi Police, though, gave both of them a clean chit. 
 
 Tanwar said the AAP leaders tried to tarnish his political image built up over 40 years. 
 
 “Not only this, Kejriwal, Pandey, Amantullah Khan and Singh called a special session of Delhi assembly and discussed this issue and passed a resolution for my arrest. Their basic intention was to somehow trap me in the frivolous and concocted murder conspiracy to ruin my life,” Tanwar said in the statement. He went on to claim that this had given him suicidal thoughts. 
 
 When contacted, the Delhi government spokesperson could not be reached for a comment.
