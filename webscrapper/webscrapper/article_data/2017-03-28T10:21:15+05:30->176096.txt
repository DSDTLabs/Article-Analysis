Panaji: Workshops and trainings for users have already begun at   (GU), Taleigao, for the implementation of the integrated university management system, and its beta version is in the test stage, GU has told   (NAAC). The integrated university management system will computerise all GU data and that of its affiliated institutes, and make it centrally manageable through a linked system.

 Under the system, users will have access to every detail under GU's ambit - such as data on students, fees, course structures, university notifications, convocations, teacher trainings, alumni, varsity assets and finance - at the click of a mouse.
 
 Once the system is operational, students will even be able to print GU authorized leaving, bonafide and migration certificates from the comfort of their homes from any corner of the state or outside.
 
 The project is estimated to cost around Rs 4 crore and is partly funded by the   ( ).
 
 The implementation of the system was recommended in 2013 by a committee constituted under professor J D'Sa and the suggestion was later accepted by the executive council. The university then called on vendors to submit their bids, in which 12 highly-reputed bodies applied. After a rigorous process, the technical committee finalized a vendor to deliver the service. 
 
 The work will start with entering Goa University student data and then, that of affiliated colleges will be added. The chosen vendor will provide five years of support and maintenance free of cost and station an engineer and other support staff at the varsity during the period.
 
 The system will reduce the time gap between delivery of services to students. It will also make it easier for the university to verify the authenticity of information and track fake certificates and check records like students' backlog of subjects.
