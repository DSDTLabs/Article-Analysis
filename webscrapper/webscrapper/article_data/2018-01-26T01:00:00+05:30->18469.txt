GAYA: The Harihar Subramanium stadium located in   area was sanitised on Thursday, ahead of the tricolour hoisting and Republic Day parade.   arrangements in   town as well as Bodh Gaya have been beefed up following the explosion and recovery of explosives on January 19. Sniffer dogs and explosive detectors have been pressed into service.

 According to SSP Garima Malik, one more round of intensive check would be conducted before the Republic Day ceremony. Nothing was being left to chance, said the SSP. Security around all vital installations including Gaya railway station and Vishnupad temple has been tightened.
 
 Police mobility in Maoist-hit areas of the district has been stepped up and area domination exercise was being undertaken by forces deployed to combat the Maoists. 
 
 However, unfazed by the January 19 explosion near his Tibetan monastery suite, Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Thursday morning interacted with several thousand school children in the Kalchakra Maidan.
 
 Children from both government and private schools spread over five districts of   division and Patna and   districts participated in the interactive session. Speaking to the students, the Dalai Lama decried the commercialisation of education and ever declining moral content in teaching and learning exercises.
 
 Dalai Lama also exhorted the students to revert back to the conventional education system as prevailed in ancient Nalanda and the time-tested Gurukul model. “A system that did not open up the students to new horizons of intellectual redemption is worth nothing,” said the spiritual leader. Eulogising the virtues of independent thinking, he exhorted the students to develop a questioning mind and independent thinking.
