DEHRADUN: With more than three persons losing their lives in separate accidents on   flyover in a short span of two months, civic authorities are planning to install speed breakers and more signboards to check speeding on the stretch.

  Dehradun SP (traffic)   told TOI, “After the recent accident in which two persons lost their lives, we have requested the officials concerned to place more signboards on flyovers. Most of the fatal accidents are due speeding and hence, we have advised the authorities to fix the speed limit to be maintained on the stretch.” “The flyovers at both Balliwala and   have blind turns making it more accident-prone.”
 
  The Ballupur flyover is approximately 700-metre-long and connects Ballupur Chowk to Clock Tower whereas the 983-metre-long ISBT flyover connects Transport Nagar to Shimla bypass.
 
  The authorities, however, claim that they had taken all steps to ensure that no accidents occur on any of the three flyovers. Hariom Sharma, chief executive engineer, PWD (NHAI), said, “The signboards are already in place but people do not follow rules. The only way to prevent accidents is to install speed breakers on flyovers since the speed limit signs are being ignored.”
 
  Meanwhile, some of the residents feel that the accidents could have been avoided if the authorities had planned the construction of the flyovers, especially the one at Balliwala, better.  , a Doon-based activist, said, “Balliwala flyover is very narrow on both sides and construction should have been done only when more land was acquired. The only solution to this issue is the widening of the flyover on both ends.”
