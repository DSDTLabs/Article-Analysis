 has been away from Mumbai shooting for &TV’s reality show India’s Asli Champion…Hai Dum in Goa for almost a month now.
 
  Recently while the action hero was busy shooting in the picturesque locales of Goa, Suniel was in for a surprise as he had a special visitor on the set.
  
  Before you start guessing who it was, let us tell you that this visitor was none other than his daughter’s co-star from her debut movie,  .
  
  
 
  
  The handsome hunk was in Goa for some work and on learning Suniel is shooting in the vicinity, he decided to pay him a visit on the sets of India’s Asli Champion…Hai Dum. The two actors were seen engaging in a long conversation over lunch.
  
  A source from the set shares, “Sooraj was in the same vicinity where Anna was shooting, so he dropped by the sets of the show. After the two chatted and had lunch, Suniel showed Sooraj around the set of the show and introduced him to the team. Sooraj, who is a fitness enthusiast just like Suniel, was curious to know the kind of tasks that have been designed for the contestants and how they train themselves.”
