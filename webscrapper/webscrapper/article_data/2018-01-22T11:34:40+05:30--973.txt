 "Salman loves singing, writing lyrics. He is acting, dancing, composing. But Salman is a better singer than me. He sings from all his heart and soul. There nothing he can't do. He can do everything," Iulia told. Iulia, however, has no plans to join films and would like to work on her singing skills. 
 
 "I have a singing teacher who helps me time to time with   and pronunciation. In fact I would love to learn classical music because it's so beautiful." "When you sing often, you improve. You have to learn the technical part too how to sing on the mike and not just enjoy singing," she said. 
 
 Iulia said music has also helped her in learning Hindi. "It's easier for me to sing now. Language is a sound so I find it easier that way and I learnt Hindi like that. Of course, I struggle sometimes with words, some of them are extremely difficult to pronounce," she said.
