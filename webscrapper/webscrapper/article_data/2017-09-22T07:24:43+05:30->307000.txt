LUCKNOW: The parents of a class VIII student of   on Thursday lodged a complaint at   alleging that they were forced to withdraw their son from the school because of physical and mental   by seniors in the hostel.

 Marking a copy of the complaint to the chief minister, education minister, district magistrate and other senior officials in the government, the parents alleged other students are also being harassed similarly and have asked police to appoint an officer to probe the matter.
 
 The parents said they had complained to the college authorities several times but instead of taking action against the boys named, they asked them to withdraw their son if they didn't like the school and hostel environment.
 
 The boy's mother Savita Singh told TOI he was harassed right from the time he was admitted as a boarder in 2015-16. In the latest incident, she said, the seniors beat up her son on August 20 and harassed him again on September 3.
 
 “He slipped into depression and told us his life is in danger and he cannot live in the hostel any more. We apprised the school offi cials but they told us bluntly to withdraw our child if we were not happy,“ she said.
 
 In their application to withdraw the boy from the school, parents mentioned “physical and mental harassment by senior boys“ as the reason. Hazratganj police CO Abhay Mishra told TOI, “No individual has been named and since the case comes under the ambit of the   Justice Act, we will take action after thorough probe.“ When contacted, college principal Carlyle McFarland refused to comment.
