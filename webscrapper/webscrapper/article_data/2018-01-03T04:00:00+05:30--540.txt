Ahmedabad: The education department has asked all schools in the state to display their fee structures on the notice board in a manner that it is easily visible to the parents. The state government has also decided to set up a portal in this connection. Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said that the government portal will contain all fee-related information of any school.  “The parents will be able to search and get the information easily,” he said. The government has also given the final ultimatum to the self-financed schools and has asked them to submit applications for revision in the fees by January 17. Chudasama said, “After the high court order, the government has decided to give three-week time to those schools who have still not moved their applications to the managements to approach before the respective fee regulation committees.” The court has upheld the constitutional validity of the state government's fee regulation law. The Act has capped fee of primary, secondary and higher secondary schools at Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 per annum respectively. There are around 2,500-odd schools that have not moved their applications. Officials in the education department said that displaying fees on the notice boards is prescribed under the Primary Education Act. However, none of the schools follows the order. In the past, S B Mandalik, the Ahmedabad district education officer, had made it mandatory to display the fee structures.
