Kochi: The high court, on Thursday, granted a five-day   to  , chairman and managing trustee of  .  , who was a student at Nehru Engineering College of Engineering at Pambady in Thrissur, was found dead inside the college hostel on January 6.

 Considering a plea for anticipatory bail filed by Krishnadas, a single bench of the court directed that he should not be arrested until February 21. If his arrest is necessary during this period, he should be released on the same day itself upon executing a bond of Rs1 lakh, the court directed.
 
 An interim bail was granted by the court after Krishnadas contended that he is not able to attend the meetings convened by the district collector to solve the issues at the engineering college.
 
 The college had alleged that Jishnu was caught for engaging in malpractice during an examination conducted earlier in the day. In the student protests that erupted, properties of the college were damaged.
 
 In a petition to the high court, Krishnadas argued that he has been accused of abetting the suicide in the case over Jishnuâ€™s death and there is a chance that he may be arrested. He has been included in the case unnecessarily as there is no material to connect him with the crime nor was there any allegation that he instigated the student to commit suicide, Krishnadas contended. He has to attend the meetings convened by the district collector and also represent the college in other avenues and he should be granted bail, the plea had said.
