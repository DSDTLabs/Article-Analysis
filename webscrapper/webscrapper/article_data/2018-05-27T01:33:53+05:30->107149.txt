NOIDA: A year on, life hasn’t changed much for  , the all-India   topper last year who had secured 498 out of 500.

 “Marks matter during admissions, but apart from the media attention, life doesn’t change much for a topper,” said Raksha. 
 
 According to her, the “highest marks” tag looks good in the resume, but a topper is treated the same as others. The 19-year-old girl, who had last year said she wanted to pursue political science from  , has been pursuing the subject from Lady Shri Ram College. But in between her studies and classes, she continues to participate in music programmes as a keyboard player. 
 
 Raksha now devotes time at an open classroom for under-privileged children outside her college as part of a project. Her love for teaching began when Raksha joined the Children Development Programme, an NGO started by LSR students to help under-privileged children of the area get education.
 
  “I started as a volunteer along with other members and used to devote around an hour and half everyday towards teaching these kids from   area. It is an open classroom outside our college premises, where around 15 of them come. This is a new project but it has been a great experience so far,” she said. Raksha, who still gets calls for advice and notes, said her achievement had in fact pushed her juniors to study more during pressure. 
 
 “I tell them not to stress out. Stress is always there from the school, parents, etc,” she said. While educationists and principals have said the upward trend in marks secured by students is the result of a “well-defined” marking scheme of the CBSE and the leniency adopted while checking copies, officials in the board attributed it to “better performance” by students.
