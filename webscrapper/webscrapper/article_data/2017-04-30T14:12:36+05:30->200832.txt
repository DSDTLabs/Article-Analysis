 has been a favourite actress for Telugu and Tamil cinema lovers ever since she made her debut and was on top of the game for two decades from 1980's. The actress only evolved over the years and is ageing very gracefully, we must say.

 The actress, who was happily settled post her successful career is making the right moves after her alleged comeback to the silver screen, again. But then, Ramya is back only to reign the south cinema with her compelling performances and acting nuances.
 
 
 
 Coming back to the latest sensation, Rajamouli's ' ' series, who else could you imagine puling of a role like ' ' with such ease, other than the ferocious 'Neelambari' from 'Narasimha'?
 
 
 
 When 'Baahubali: The Beginning' released in 2015, heaps of appreciations poured in for Ramya Krishna, who replaced another veteran Sridevi, who was the first choice of the director to play Sivagami. No wonder, it was Ramya Krishna as the Rajamatha, who stole the entire show in the first part. 
 
 
 Now that the second instalment- 'Baahubali: The Conclusion' is released to establish an international record, Ramya Krishna is again being flooded with notes and gestures of appreciations including several messages and calls. The actress seemed so overwhelmed and couldn't contain her excitement and shared it with her fans.
 
 
 Taking to her social media handle, the actress wrote, "Love you all. Without your love, affection and support I wouldn’t be where I am today. I am so overwhelmed. Jai Mahishmati,” (sic).
 
 
 We hope to see the actress in more such challenging roles in her upcoming projects.
