CHENNAI: After a dry week, showers may return to the city this weekend. The met office has forecast that rain or thundershowers would occur towards afternoon or evening on Saturday and Sunday.

 Interior and southern districts of Tamil Nadu received above normal   this month, but districts including   in north Tamil Nadu have remained relatively dry. Weather blogger   said, “Land breeze brought by westerly winds into the city is growing in strength. Formation of thunderstorm clouds is likely along Vellore, Kanchipuram and Tiruvallur. Chennai could also fall under the path of the predicted storms.”
