GHAZIABAD: Faced with a fund crisis for the Dilshad Garden-New Bus stand Metro project, the   (GDA) on Thursday took up the issue with Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Rajiv Kumar Singh in Lucknow following which he gave the UP housing board and the UPSIDC (Uttar Pradesh state industrial development corporation) 10 days to release their share of funds.

 The meeting convened by the chief secretary. 
 
 GDA secretary Ravider Godbole, who was also present at the meeting, said the state government has taken up the   issue seriously and intends to sort out the issue with other agencies who have not yet released their share of the funds for their project.
 
 “The Metro funding issue has been hanging fire for a long time now and as a nodal agency for the project the DMRC have been building pressure on us so we took the matter with the state government,” said Godbole. 
 
 He further said, “On Thursday the chief secretary convened a meeting of all stake holders including the Housing Board, UPSIDC and   officials and gave them a 10-day period to disburse their share of funds and report back to him.”
 
 As of now, the GDA has paid Rs 640 crore out of its share of Rs 695 crore.
 
 The UP Housing Board has paid just Rs 50 crore against its share Rs 440 crore while out of Rs 97 crore the UPSIDC has paid just Rs 3.3 crore.
 
 The GMC is yet to pay out of its share of Rs246 crore.
 
 “As far as the GMC’s contribution to the fund is concerned we are in the final stage where we will adjust the GMC’s fund in lieu of its land of the same value in our posession,” said Godbole. The project is pegged at Rs 2,210 crore and the various UP agencies have to collectively contribute Rs 1,479.6 crore while the remaining amount is to be borne by the Centre. Speaking about the Centre’s contribution, Godbole said that it requires vetting by the UP cabinet which will be done shortly.
