New Delhi: The members of the admissions grievance committee of   and the dean of students welfare (DSW) officially stopped working for around four hours on Friday following the heckling of officials by former   president  , an   member, over an admission   on Thursday. 

 However, some officials helped out candidates from their offices, while the helpdesk, run mostly by student volunteers, was also functional. According to an official present during the incident on Thursday, Awana came with a candidate who had a complaint regarding payment of registration fees. The candidate claimed that he had paid the fees, but it was not reflecting on the portal, said the official, adding that the complainant was asked to bring the transaction number to facilitate the verification and track the payment. 
 
 Awana allegedly intervened at this point and refused to furnish any details, leading to an altercation that soon turned into a scuffle, said the official. The former DUSU president assaulted officials, he alleged. In protest, the officials locked the grievance committee room on Friday.
 
 However, Awana said he had taken up the case as the candidate was “eligible for admissions”. While an official was dealing with the grievance, he said, another raised his voice and started misbehaving with the applicant and other students. He called the shutdown an “over-reaction”. 
 
 The officials, however, insisted that they had been resolving the grievance amicably until Awana got agitated and assaulted the officials.
