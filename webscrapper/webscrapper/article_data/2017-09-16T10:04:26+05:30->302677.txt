MUMBAI:   legend   believes the upcoming Fifa Under-17 World Cup has the potential to do for India what last year's European Championship did for Wales, especially if  ' boys can make the most of their status as hosts of next month's showpiece.

 For all his success at club level, Giggs never had the opportunity to leave his mark on the biggest of international stages simply because his native Wales never managed to qualify for either World Cup or the European Championships during his playing days.
 
 That barren run came to an end when Wales qualified for Euro 2016 where the side spearheaded by   star   made an impressive march to the semifinals. "In the Euros Wales, my country, had never been to a major championship for 60 years and they got to the semifinal and the impact it had on Wales as a country was huge not only for the next couple of months, but actually a generation," said Giggs, who captained the Great Britain side at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
 
 "So, you have a generation watching Wales in a major championship, exciting the whole family and you will remember that forever. So, if India get it right with the U-17s championship, then it will last for a long time, which can only be good for football in India," the former winger added.
