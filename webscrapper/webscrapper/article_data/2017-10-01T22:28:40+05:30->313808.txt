ALMORA: Like many other dying rivers in the country, the quietly flowing Kosi may soon shrink to a dangerous level if debris thrown into it from construction work along the river front is not prohibited soon. For the past one year, tonnes of untreated solid waste from construction activities for widening the existing NH 109, between Khaina and Almora, are choking the river. In the first phase of the project, work for a four-lane highway is being undertaken between Khairna and Kwarab bridge in Almora.   Already declared a vulnerable river, experts now believe that it might soon die if desilting is not done at the earliest. “The Kosi river does not originate from a glacier and global warming has already impacted it source. This sensitive river should be taken earnest care of. The methods of road construction work and dumping debris into the river will have severe impact on the water body,” said J S Rawat, head, department of Geography, Kumaon University, Almora.    When TOI visited the construction site, earth movers and other heavy vehicles were seen to be constantly throwing debris into the river. Officials, on the other hand, said that mud and other debris is being utilized to give shape to the road.    Chief engineer, NH 109, Ayaz Ahmed said, “ We are not throwing construction waste into the river. We have been working according to official guidelines. There are no dumping grounds nearby and we have been using the debris collected to give shape to the road.”    “Other rivers in the Himalayas are also being treated similarly. We had earlier filed a PIL with the National Green Tribunal regarding pollution in Alaknanda river from the Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydro Electric project. But the problem is that there are no proper laws regarding dumping of debris in the country,” said Vimal Babu, member of the Matu Jan Sangathan, an organization that works on dam related issues.
