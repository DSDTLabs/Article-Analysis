A ladies get-together organised by a social club in Kanpur for its members was a hit from the word go. Going by the dress code of the party, all the ladies came decked up in blue saris.
"This time we all chose to be dressed in traditional attire.That's why we decided to have a blue sari theme for the party. See how pretty all the club members are looking!" said  , the hostess for the do. The highlight of the evening was the singing and dancing where all the members danced on latest Bollywood numbers.
