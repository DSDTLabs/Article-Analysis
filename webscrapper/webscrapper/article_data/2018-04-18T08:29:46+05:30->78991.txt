MUMBAI: After finishing runners up in the   (MDFA)-conducted Elite Division for the last two seasons,   were adamant to avoid a deja vu of sorts when they took on   in the final league match at the   on Tuesday. Air India, on 30 points, needed a draw to win the league while ONGC (on 28) had to win the game to emerge champs.

 
 ONGC toiled in the midfield and toyed with the Air India defence for majority of the match. They were rewarded in the 83rd minute when Ghanian Enock Annan’s header found the back of the net after an Air India defender made a mess of a clearance.
 
 Air India, who won all of their games in the tournament so far, looked a better side at the beginning but failed to create chances despite having former India player Steven Dias in their side. ONGC on the other hand, were content playing the counter-attacking game.
 
 Just when it looked like the game was going to end in a draw, which would be enough for Air India, Himanshu Jain’s floating ball from the left was cleared by an Air India defender. The ball however, ballooned up and Annan beat two defenders to get to it first and head it past goalkeeper Praveen C.
 
 ONGC veteran player Jatin Singh Bisht said the victory couldn’t be sweeter as it was their third consecutive final.
 
 “Air India have always been our arch-rivals so it’s a great feeling to win the league after beating them in such a way. We knew that all we needed was a goal and I’m glad we were finally able to get that,” he told TOI.
