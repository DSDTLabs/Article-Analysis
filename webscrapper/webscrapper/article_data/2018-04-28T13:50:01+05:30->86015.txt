HUBBALLI: Prime Minister   will give a major boost to the   ahead of the assembly election by taking part in several rallies in Karnataka, said BJP national spokesperson  .

 Speaking with reporters here on Friday Rao said, “During every election in the country, surveys and opinion polls have been conservative and they have underestimated BJP’s performance. They always gave low projections to the party and yet BJP jas performed beyond their expectations. It has been proven in the elections held in UP and recently in Tripura and other states.”
 
 “In Karnataka too,   will lose power. Knowing this, Siddaramaiah has been busy dividing the society on the basis of caste and creed. He also became ‘Sultan Siddaramaiah’ just for vote bank politics and is also backing PFI, SDPI,” Rao alleged.
 
 He denied the possibility of a hung assembly in Karnataka and predicted BJP will get a significant verdict. 
 
 “BJP is a party with a difference. It has not protected any leader if found guilty. But the Siddaramaih’s government has not taken any action against tainted ministers,” he added.
 
 “The nexus between Congress and contractors is the new thing of corruption in Karnataka and it was introduced by Siddaramaiah,” he alleged.
 
 Narasimha Rao urged Congress to apologise to the people of Karnataka for lying. “Rahul Gandhi misled the people of Karnataka by claiming that his party’s government implemented more than 90% of the assurances made in its manifesto. Hardly 10% of the issues are addressed by Congress government in its five year’ tenure,” he said.
