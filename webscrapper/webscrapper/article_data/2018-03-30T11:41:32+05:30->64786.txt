Rajkot: A forester serving at Junagadh’s   has been transferred outside the wildlife circle after a departmental inquiry found him guilty of taking selfies with lions and illegal photography of wild animals in prohibited areas.

 Nilesh Vegda, the forester, was previously serving in Dhari but was transferred to the zoo after several complaints against him. 
 
 Amreli-based RTI activist Abdul Qureshi had filed a complaint against Vegda with the secretary of forest department in Gandhinagar alleging that he used to take illegal selfies and photographs of wild animals in Gir east area of Dhari, Dalkhania range and   west. He stated in his application that such acts amount to harassment of wild animals and committed this offence under Wildlife Conservation Act despite being a forester himself. 
 
 Qureshi had also alleged that said Vegda used to enter the sanctuary area with a revolver which is prohibited under the law except with due permission. He alleged that the forester was also harassing lions in Sakkarbaug Zoo. 
 
 A P Singh, chief conservator of forest ( ) at   wildlife circle, who carried out an inquiry, said, “After previous complaints, he was transferred to Sakkarbaug Zoo from Dhari but now I have requested that he should be transferred outside the wildlife circle. His pictures were found with wild animals but it’s not a major offence. Therefore, he has been transferred and minor penalty has been imposed. He was found with revolver inside the sanctuary but it was a service revolver,” Singh told TOI. 
 
 However, Qureshi also alleged that Vegda was organizing illegal lion shows but the inquiry did not find any truth in these allegations. “He should be suspended and an offence should be registered under the Act against him. Mere transfer is not sufficient punishment,” he told TOI.
