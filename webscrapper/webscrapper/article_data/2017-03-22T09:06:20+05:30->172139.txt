MUMABI: Quick thinking and   helped save the life of a 28-year-old woman who was trying to cross the   on Monday.   hopped across the tracks and was trying to clamber onto platform 3, blissfully unaware that the local train headed towards CST was trundling on the same track towards her.

 Motorman Anil Yadav said he spotted the woman struggling to hop onto the platform around 2 pm. “I honked, hoping she would move away from the track, but she just did not,“ said Yadav. “I applied   in the nick of time.“
 
 Trains move at a speed of 30-40 km per hour while pulling into a station. Yadav said that the woman had enough time and warning to dart out in the other direction. Central Railway officials said that the woman could have failed to notice the approaching train or hear the horn.
 
 “The train brushed past the woman, causing minor injuries around the head and ears,“ said a railway official. Passengers helped her get onto the platform where she was given first aid. Chief public relations officer of Central Railway,  , said that Yadav will be rewarded.
