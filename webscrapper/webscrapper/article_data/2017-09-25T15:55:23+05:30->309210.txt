KOLKATA: The celebrated   found itself at the centre of a controversy on Saturday by depicting a doctor as a demon at its central Kolkata pandal. It sparked off a valiant protest from the city’s medical community which described the move as ‘highly insensitive’ and demanded the intervention of the police commissioner. A doctors’ body threatened to sue the puja organizers prompting the latter to stick a board on the controversial idol which said the demon is a fake doctor. Later in the afternoon, the organizers put the image behind a veil and also covered the Durga idol, cutting it out of the view of visitors. The puja will be inaugurated on Sunday.

 “Asur-rupi nokol daktar der prati ghrina ebong asol daktar der prati shraddha” (We detest fake doctors and respect the real ones) said the board. While the organizers defended themselves saying they had no intention of insulting the medical community and the image was meant to highlight the menace of fake doctors – many of whom have been arrested in Kolkata recently – several doctors’ bodies described the move as a dangerous one that could incite further violence against medics.
 
 “Doctors have been assaulted, harassed and insulted enough. Now, this is the last straw. Depicting a doctor as an asura will provoke hatred against them and more attacks on innocent medics. We demand an immediate removal of the image or else we will be forced to launch a state-wide agitation,” said   of Doctors for Patients (DOPA).
 IMA Bengal, too, joined the protest and called for the removal of the image. Later, however, it issued a statement thanking the organizer for clarifying that the image depicted a fake doctor and was not be taken as a comment against the entire medical community. “This could have been done earlier. But we thank  , former   and chairman of the puja committee for doing the needful after speaking to me,” said  , state secretary, IMA Bengal.
