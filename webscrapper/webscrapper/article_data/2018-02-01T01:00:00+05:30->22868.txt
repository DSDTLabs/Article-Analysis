Six years after their first film together,   and   will soon share screen space in two films this year, one of them being Vipul Amrutlal Shah’s 'Namastey England', which was originally titled 'Namastey Canada'. BT was the first to tell you that Arjun and Parineeti had been cast for the romantic drama, which will go on floors this month. While it’s known that the movie will be shot in Mumbai, Punjab and the United Kingdom, word is that the film’s narrative virtually travels across half the globe.

 The story unfolds across Amritsar and Ludhiana in Punjab, moves to Dhaka, Bangladesh, followed by a portion, which will be shot in Brussels, Belgium, apart from sequences shot in parts of London, the UK countryside and Mumbai. When we asked Vipul, he confirmed the news, “I will start shooting very soon and I plan to kick it off with some scenes and then step into the songs. This film is very special for everyone. Yes, it involves a lot of travelling because the script has turned out to be that way. There will be times when my family will join me at work and times when I will be far off, but I want to shoot this film exactly the way the script has shaped up. I want to stick to it and if travelling half the globe is the way to do it, so be it.”
