JAIPUR: Two-time APRC champion Gaurav   asserted his supremacy in the MRF FMSCI Indian National Rally Championship 2017 by comfortably winning four out of the six special stages to claim round 3.

 Gill and his partner   took barely 13:21.1 minutes to complete the 13.9 kilometre Night Hawk stage, zipping through the sharp turns and undulating curves in the dark with ease.
 
 The pair, however, suffered issues in SS 2, the tricky Shiv Shakti 1, taking 6:49.1 long minutes to finish fifth in the stage, yielding the lead to defending champion   of Arka Motorports (6:01.5) and his own teammate   (6:12.1) for the first time this year.
 
 Karna and Amittrajit's joy was, however, short-lived. Gill was back in his elements in SS 3, the Flying Machine stage, yesterday taking an astounding 12:09.5 minutes to crack the 13.8 kilometres to reclaim the rally lead.
 
 Gill in his XUV was beyond everybody's reach in the next two stages too, driving in his typically aggressive manner. He needed just 5:55.4 minutes to complete SS 4 and widen his lead.   and Amittrajit kept pace till that stage but then disaster struck both of them.
 
 One stage, the SS 6, had to be cancelled due to an emergency in the village that required the rally to be stopped to let an ambulance with a lady in labour rush to the hospital.
