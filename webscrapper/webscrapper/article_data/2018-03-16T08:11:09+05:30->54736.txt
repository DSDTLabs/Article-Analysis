New Delhi: Soon after the   (CoA) sent out a mail listing fresh dos and don’ts for   office-bearers,   chairman   raised a question mark over BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary’s travel plans to Sri Lanka, sources told TOI. It is understood that some board office-bearers had also questioned the logic behind Choudhary travelling to Sri Lanka for three days without a specific purpose.

 
 
 
 Sources said a communication has been sent to Choudhary in this regard. He was asked by CoA to explain his functional duties on his visit to Sri Lanka. Some office-bearers had earlier pointed out that Choudhary was travelling 25 days a month on a hefty daily allowance from BCCI. 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, sources said that the Sri Lankan board had invited Choudhary in capacity of the director of India at ICC. As per the Supreme Court’s order, Choudhary is mandated to represent India at ICC. Therefore, his trip to Lanka does not need clearance from CoA. But the question being raised is: Why is Choudhary travelling on BCCI’s expense?
 
 When TOI tried to reach out to Choudhary, he declined to comment. Even as the CoA waits for a suitable reply from Choudhary, his Lankan trip could still be on as he has pre-booked his return ticket. But from here on, the board officials will have a lot of explaining to do before planning trips — at home or abroad.
