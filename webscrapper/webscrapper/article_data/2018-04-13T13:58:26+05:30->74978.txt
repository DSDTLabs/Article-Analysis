PATNA: Preparations are on for the ring ceremony of incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad and former CM Rabri Devi’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav with former minister Chandrika Rai’s daughter Aishwarya Rai at a posh hotel in the city on April 18.

 “Invites are being sent out to guests. Lalu-ji is likely to move the court for permission to attend the engagement ceremony,” Rai told TOI on Thursday.
 
 The RJD chief is serving imprisonment after his conviction in multi-crore fodder scam cases.
 
 The wedding ceremony is slated to be held at the city’s veterinary college ground on May 12. “All the seven sisters of the groom will attend the ring ceremony to which only close relatives and friends will be invited,” a Lalu aide said.
 
 Rabri’s official residence at 10, Circular Road is being given facelift for the occasion. 
 
 On April 6, Tej flew to Delhi to meet Lalu at AIIMS- Delhi where he is undergoing treatment under custody. “Papa se milne aaya, to unhone ashirvad ke jhadi laga di (My father showered blessings on me when I came to meet him),” Tej tweeted the same evening and also posted a photograph with the father-son duo in the frame. 
 
 Few days later, another photograph of Tej and Aishwarya along with the latter’s family members also appeared in the social media. The photograph was said to be of the Patna airport where the would-be bride and groom had a chance encounter.
 
 Tej has passed Class XII. Aishwarya is a grad from Delhi University’s premier Miranda House. She also has an MBA degree.
 
 Wedding bells will ring at Lalu-Rabri residence after a gap of four years. The couple’s youngest daughter Raj Laxmi tied the knot with   patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh in 2014.
