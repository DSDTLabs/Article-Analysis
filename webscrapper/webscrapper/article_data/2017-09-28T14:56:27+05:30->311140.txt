Purohit demanded Rs 1.60 lakh from Patel half of which was to be paid after he gets joining letter,” the police said. 
 
 After few days, Patel got a call following which he gave Rs 80,000 to Neelima Modi, an accomplice of Purohit. The complainant was given a list of candidates on a paper that also had railway department’s stamp. Patel told the cops that after some days he and some other youngsters were asked by Purohit to visit   for training. They were then taken to Delhi later and given blank papers and asked to write questions and answers. The victims were asked to return home and later again taken to Udaipur in Rajasthan. 
 
 But they were not given any posting. Patel said that Purohit had taken Rs 70,000 from his sister by promising her a job in railways. The police have booked Purohit for cheating and producing fake documents. He is suspected to have cheated many more job aspirants.
