PATNA: At least eight persons feared drowned when an overcrowded fishing boat carrying 15 people, all members of a marriage party, capsized in the Kosi river at Naugachia in   district around 3.30pm on Sunday.

 Naugachia SP Nidhi Rani said a search and rescue operation involving State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel is underway. “Seven persons have so far been rescued. They are undergoing treatment at the sadar hospital in Naugachia,” the SP added.
 
 Locals, however, alleged the SDRF personnel began the search and rescue operation almost four hours after the incident. “Many lives could have been saved had the SDRF launched the rescue operation on time,” one of them said.
 
 Naugachia circle officer Uday Kumar Yadav, however, refuted the charge. “The SDRF personnel swung into action soon after receiving information,” he claimed.
 
 The SP said the boat capsized hardly 400 metres away from a pontoon bridge in the river. “Those on board the ill-fated boat were returning from a village in Purnia after attending a marriage ceremony. They had used the pontoon bridge while going to the village. However, while returning, they boarded the small boat, which is used only for fishing,” the SP added.
