GURUGRAM: The special investigation team ( ), which is probing the  , will conduct a   on suspended assistant sub inspector Vikas Kumar, who claimed that he was not involved in the scam. The investigators have taken the court’s permission to conduct the test on the police officer. 

 Inspector Jasmer Singh, who was also arrested for his alleged role in the scam, has already confessed that he had bought an illegal weapon from prime accused Manish Bhardwaj and sold it to a Lucknow resident for around Rs 2.77 lakh. Though Jasmer’s brother Ved Prakash had claimed that he would submit the documentary evidence of the weapon sale, he failed to do so, according to sources.
 
 Jasmer, sources said, told interrogators that he was a “good friend” of Bhardwaj and both of them were “fond of shooting”. They reportedly took part in shooting competitions and stayed together in hotels in several cities. However, the SIT is suspicious about Jasmer’s claim that he was not involved in the re-registration of arms licence.
 
 “Inspector Jasmer Singh confessed to have sold illegal weapons. ASI Kumar also joined the investigation. Since Kumar is not cooperating with us, we sought court’s nod to conduct   test on him. The test will be conducted as soon as we got a date from Forensic Science Lab in Madhuban,” said assistant commissioner of police Anil Yadav, the SIT head. 
 
 The scam kingpin, Bhardwaj, had told police that he used to give “shares” to the four police officers booked in the case every time a licence was issued. Bhardwaj told interrogators that he paid Rs 50,000-1 lakh per licence to both Jasmer and ASI Virender Singh.
