The cycle tracks in Noida were announced and built amid much fanfare, having been inspired by the cycle tracks former CM Akhilesh Yadav saw on his Netherlands trip, and touted to be the 'best in the NCR'. But their usability has been debated even last year, when cyclists told us the tracks are nearly unusable on many stretches, and of little practical help to serious cyclists in Noida.

  Recently, the current government's decision to demolish these tracks has been in the news, announced by UP’s urban development minister Suresh Khanna. However, it seems cyclists in Noida are still divided over the effectiveness of these tracks. Many serious cyclists in Noida are part of the Noida Cycling Club, and when we spoke to some members, there seemed to be no one united view within the club. Some agree with the government - that the tracks are a traffic nuisance, and should be demolished so cyclists can use the wider roads. Others say that while the tracks are not well-planned and are obstructed by garbage and parking in many places, the government should correct these problems and make the tracks usable instead of demolishing them.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 These cycle tracks should be demolished so that the roads can be widened. Since they are not maintained properly, cyclists can’t use them. Many times, I’ve wanted to use these tracks, but have seen a lot of garbage being dumped on them. Many cars also enter these tracks, making it difficult for us to ride. There are many obstructions. It’s the same story in Delhi. Cycling tracks are just not maintained here.

 The main purpose of laying cycle tracks was that cyclists should be safe, but that is not the case with cycling tracks in Noida, and that is why I think they should be demolished. I have seen the cycle tracks in Sector 62, 18 and 16 - most of them are occupied by vehicles or vendors. It has become a footpath instead of a cycling track. During the day, we can see all the potholes on these tracks, but at night we can't, so it's dangerous. I feel that roads are safer than cycling tracks. If we ask people to move from there, they ignore us. Haq jama liya hai unhone cycle tracks pe. In Sector 62, the tracks have been turned into a parking lot. Cyclists have no other option except to ride on the road anyway. Cyclists must be given importance. The government should get regular updates from the local police or authorities as to whether the tracks are being maintained or not. Street lights and other facilities should also be provided on the tracks.

 These cycle tracks should not be demolished – instead, their condition should be improved so that more people can use them. Most of the cycling tracks are so narrow that it's difficult to use them. At some places, vendors have parked their carts on the tracks. Also, these tracks are not continuous - for instance, kahin pe 1km ka stretch hai toh kahin pe 2km ka. Since every track has some or the other problem, it’s difficult to cycle on them.

 Every country, every state is becoming bicycle-friendly, and here we are talking about demolishing already laid cycle tracks. The government should instead take measures to improve their condition. During the  , everyone came out in support of a cycling culture, and therefore the tracks were built, but now, no one wants to take care of these tracks. I think that the government should take up maintenance of all these tracks and should completely bar vehicles from driving through them. They should also fine people who enter the cycling tracks, be it hawkers or vendors.

 I don't think that the cycle tracks should be demolished. The cycling culture is growing in Noida and I think the government should promote this. The main problem with the cycling tracks in Noida is that there are a lot of obstructions. Aapko kahin bhi beech mein gaadi parked milegi. Vendors and hawkers are also there. Isme safai bhi nahin hoti hai. If I take my cycle out on the tracks, I'm usually apprehensive about punctures (caused by garbage). Often, bikers also ride through the cycle tracks when there are jams. But these issues can be resolved and the government must come forward to improve the condition of these tracks.
