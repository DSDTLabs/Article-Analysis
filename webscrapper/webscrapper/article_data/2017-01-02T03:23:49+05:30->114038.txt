LUCKNOW: A tweet by   state president   at 1.48pm on Saturday read: “As per orders of Netaji, the orders to expel   and   have been revoked with immediate effect. All of us would unitedly fight the communal forces, and form a majority government in the state.”

 The development followed a significant show of strength by supporters of Akhilesh Yadav outside his official residence. The party’s state unit chief announced the decision of the SP chief while addressing workers inside the party office. “I met party chief Mulayam Singh along with chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. Netaji ( ) has ordered to terminate the suspension orders of Akhilesh and Ram Gopal with immediate effect,” said Shivpal.
 
 Urging party workers to head to their constituencies and start preparations for the polls in right earnest, Shivpal said, “Candidates who got cycle as election symbol from Netaji must rush to their assembly constituency and publicise the development work done by the SP government.” He stated that 2017 would be good for youngsters and job seekers if SP is voted to power again. “Whenever the Samajwadi Party has united, it got huge majority in elections,” said Shivpal, adding, “After Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, the BJP was wiped out and it will meet the same fate post-demonetisation.” He paid tributes to socialist leader Raj Narain on his death anniversary. “It was because of Raj Narain that then PM Indira Gandhi had to impose Emergency. And after it was lifted, Congress suffered a humiliating defeat,” said Shivpal.
