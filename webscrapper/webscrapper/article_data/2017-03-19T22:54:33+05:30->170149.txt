KOLKATA: In a massive rescue operation that continued till late on Saturday, troops of the Army's Blazing Sword Division rescued 127 tourists at the historic Sela Pass near Tawang. The tourists had got stuck in a massive snow blizzard that struck on Saturday around 2.45 pm between Ahirgarh, Sela and Nuranang on the road from Tezpur to Tawang in the West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.

 "After reports of tourists and transients stuck in the blizzard were received, the Army swung into action and a rescue operation was launched in less than an hour. With darkness setting in by 5 pm, the entire operation was almost conducted in the dark and continued till all 127 transients including five foreign nationals from Japan, New Zealand and Bulgaria were rescued. One Bulgarian national slipped and fell down the steep gorge while she was trying to move on her own. Her mortal remains were recovered around midnight," a senior officer from the Eastern Command said.
 
 The rescued persons were accommodated at Army transit camps and provided medical assistance and all comforts. The road had about 2-3 feet of snow and was opened for traffic on Sunday by the Border Roads Organisation. All vehicles were recovered and the transients left for their respective destinations.
