BENGALURU: A group of  , HSR Layout, Hosapalya, Somsundarpalya and Parangipalya on Saturday petitioned BBMP and the government to shut down the   (KCDC)  .

 They handed over the petition to the government, BBMP and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), calling the movement their `Right to breathe'. Complaining of eye and skin irritation and breathing ailments, they said the plant has already crossed its life span of 25 years. It was set up in 1975. It was the same plant that forced schoolchildren to send postcards to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to issue orders to shut it down.
 
 Though BBMP had promised that steps would be taken to control the odour by February 2016, nothing has changed. The plant has a capacity to treat 60 tonnes of waste every day . Instead, it is only treating 150 tonnes of waste and leading to groundwater contamination in the area, the residents alleged. In October 2015, residents had protested outside the KCDC plant but to no avail.
 
 The forum alleged the plant has encroached upon the Haralkunte (Somasandrakere) lakebed and the BBMP nursery , and its leachate is polluting the lake.
