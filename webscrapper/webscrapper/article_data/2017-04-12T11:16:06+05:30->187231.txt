AHMEDABAD:   Biscuits Pvt Ltd approached the Gujarat high court on Tuesday against the notice issued by a food inspector in Bharuch over the use of lactic acid in its Kachcha Mango Bite candy.

 The food company has contended before the HC that the use of lactic acid is permissible and is not harmful for health.
 
 The high court stayed the government from taking any action till further order. It issued a notice to the government and the designated officer and scheduled further hearing on May 2.
 
 In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in   ordered Parle to recall Mango Bite, but the Bombay high court later struck down the FDAâ€™s decision.
