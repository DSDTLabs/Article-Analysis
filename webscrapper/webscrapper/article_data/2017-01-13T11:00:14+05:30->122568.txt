BHUBANESWAR: Though not a party member, nor a highly-qualified staffer,   is perceived as chief minister  's man Friday. Though nobody knows how he gained proximity to 'inaccessible' Naveen, sources in   said he was a newspaper hawker in the past. 

 BJD sources said Sahoo, 38, hailed from   in Khandapada area of Nayagarh district. "We know in 1996-97, he used to eke out a living as a newspaper hawker. He was also doing a part time job as typewriter assistant in a photocopy shop in Bapuji Nagar," said a BJD insider.
 
 Fate smiled on him when he came in contact with a sitting BJD MLA, who was then close to Naveen, when the latter was a Union minister. Sahoo came in contact with the MLA, who would often came to the shop to make photocopies of the party releases. The leader took him to Naveen Niwas where Sahoo worked as a peon, said the BJD functionary.
 
 He became so close to Naveen that the latter made him his office secretary. Naveen authorized him to put his signature on party releases, mostly the suspension or revocation of suspension orders of leaders, the party functionary said.
 
 Talks were doing the rounds that Sahoo played a key role in recommending the names of some MLA and MP candidates to Naveen in the 2014 elections. "Whosoever wanted to meet Naveen or his senior officers at his residence had to please Sahoo first," said a cop at Naveen Niwas. 
 
 While the BJD MLA, who brought him to Naveen Niwas, was suspended from the party in 2011 for alleged  , Sahoo kept cementing his position in the party. He has been sidelined ever since CBI interrogated him in November 2014 in Seashore scam.
