KANPUR: Levelling allegations of influencing the witnesses and the locals of   village in the alleged rape case, the uncle of   rape survivor in a complaint sent to Unnao SP informed him that the younger brother of the rape accused BJP MLA   is trying to create terror in the village. 

 The rape survivor's uncle in his letter, the copy of which he has forwarded to the UP chief minister, director CBI, principal secretary (home), DM Unnao and DG (prison), has mentioned that when he and his family had gone to Makhi along with the CBI team on on April 28, Manoj Singh Sengar, younger brother of   Sengar also visited the village on the same evening and went to the same spots that the CBI had visited.
 
 Talking to TOI, he said, "  along with his 15-20 men visited the same spots in Makhi where CBI had earlier gone and tried to influence the witnesses and the villagers. He is trying to unleash his terror in the area and is threatening people not to speak against them."
 
 He alleged this was an attempt to influence and bully the witnesses so that the people did not open their mouth against Kuldeep Sengar's family. 
 
 All this was being done at the behest of Kuldeep Sengar and Atul Singh, who are in jail, he added.
 
 "If Kuldeep and Atul remain in Unnao jail, such acts will keep on happening, which besides wiping out evidences, may also influence the witnesses in the case. I have, therefore, requested the authorities to conduct an investigation into the complaint and take appropriate action," the rape survivor's uncle told TOI.
