While   is a great platform for celebrities to interact with their fans and make important announcements, sometimes, they don’t shy away from engaging in open war with one another too. M-town actors   and   are current examples of online war.

  
  
 
 Recently Neha had put up a picture of a beautiful place on   and had wished to go there. On that tweet, Lalit mocked her by saying that, “People just wish to travel places. Don’t just wish, take out time and travel.” Neha came to know that Lalit is mocking her and she tweeted back saying that she is busy and doesn’t have time to travel.
 
  
  
 
 On that, Lalit replied back that what’s the use of all the money that you earn if you can’t fulfill your wishes. Though Neha didn’t reply to this tweet but on the next day Neha seem to have scorned Lalit on his tweet “Super Duper excited for tonight’s match. Looking forward to your performance. Fingers.” Neha teased Lalit by tweeting, “It’s so annoying when actors think they are better cricketers and advice players on their game!” 
 The fight didn’t end here. Lalit answered back by saying that girls watch cricket matches just to watch cricketers, shouldn’t comment on this game and by this tweet Neha certainly got fumed and she replied back by tweeting, “People who watch tennis just for the hot miniskirts are sure to think others watch cricket for similar reasons”. The reason behind this twitter cold war between the two is yet to be revealed, but for now their fans must be enjoying this fight.
