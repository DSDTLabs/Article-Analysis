Panaji: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) opposed the bail plea of   Khan, a businessman who was arrested on Tuesday evening for the alleged theft of iron ore worth crores of rupees. 

 The plea came up for hearing before the principal district and sessions judge Irshad Agha, on Wednesday morning.
 
 The applicant’s lawyer, Nitin Sardesai, questioned the prosecution’s basis for justifying his custodial interrogation now, when the case was registered in 2013. The SIT, in its reply, said the applicant had committed illegalities in the mining sector from 2007 to 2012.
 
 Sardesai argued that even four years after the FIR was registered, the SIT has only been conducting preliminary investigation. “Reckless allegations have been made, but no material has been brought on record to show the applicant’s involvement,” he told the court.
 
 The counsel further said that Khan couldn’t be charged with theft of ore because “he was the trader”. He was responding to the prosecution’s charge that Khan’s alleged theft had caused the state exchequer losses to the tune of crores of rupees.
 
 Public prosecutor G P Kirtani said Khan’s custodial interrogation was required to unearth a deep-rooted criminal conspiracy in the theft of iron ore.
 
 Sardesai, however, said the mining lease (TC no 65/51) located at Curpem, Sanguem, belonged to Amalia Figueiredo, and was held by her legal heirs upon her death. Khan was given the power of attorney, he said, adding that the lease could be transferred under law with the consent of the owner. 
 
 But Kirtani argued that although the lease was not granted to Khan, he was illegally allowed to extract iron ore through a partnership firm, Imran Traders. Kirtani pointed out that the transfer of the mining lease without the previous consent of the state government couldn’t be effected.
