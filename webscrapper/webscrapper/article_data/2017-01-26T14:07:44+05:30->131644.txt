PANAJI:   spokesperson Trajano D’Mello sympathised with fellow Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sunil Kawthankar who lashed out at senior leaders recently for ‘demoralizing young party workers’. 

 He alleged that instead of giving tickets to young leaders Congress leaders were infusing the party with RSS blood by appointing Manohar Pandurang Shirodkar as a candidate in Bicholim. 
 
 “Six months ago, the same person criticized the ethics of Congress leaders. The same person has been brought into the Congress and allotted a ticket. Hasn’t this been set? When a candidate is weak the expression used is ‘loyalist’ and when the party wants to import a candidate they call him ‘winnable’. The secular people of Goa have been sold to communalism by the   and Congress leadership.
 
 Hitting out at opposition leader Pratapsingh Rane, he alleged that the party wasn’t aggressive in attacking the present government.
