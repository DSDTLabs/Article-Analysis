AURANGABAD: In a huge relief to genuine candidates vying for the 63 posts of constables,   superintendent of police Chandrakishore   has decided to conduct a fresh written test instead of calling off the recruitment process. 

 Several government offices from across the state have come under the scanner while some police units have cancelled the entire recruitment. after the Nanded police recently busted the fudging of marks scam involving the Pune-based private firm  .
 
 "There were only 13 candidates who, with the help of the private firm, managed to fudge the scores. We should not punish hundreds of genuine candidates because of some elements. The students might have been preparing for months for the recruitment," said Mina.
 
 The officer said that a fresh written test would be conducted after getting a clearance from the DGP's office. In the face of the scam that has raised serious questions over roping in of private companies in carrying out recruitment processes by different government departments across the state, the move by Mina is being considered as a courageous one.
 
 A deputy superintendent of police said, "Any officer, for the sake of saving his own image, would have cancelled the entire recruitment. However, the Nanded SP is giving priority to the genuine candidates and sending a positive message."
