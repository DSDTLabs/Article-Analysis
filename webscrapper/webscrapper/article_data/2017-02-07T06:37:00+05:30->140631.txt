KOLKATA: The   on Monday granted bail to Manoranjana Sinh, one of the accused in Saradha muddle and estranged wife of former MP Matang Sinh. Manoranjana — who had filed a bail petition in the apex court on October 5, 2016 — was arrested by CBI on October, 2015.

 The court on Monday held that further confinement of Manoranjana in judicial custody is not an ‘indispensable necessity’ for the investigation in progress. Due to the conditional bail, Manoranjana has to surrender her passport to the trial court and not leave Kolkata without permission of the court and the investigating agency.
 
 Though Manoranjana — currently admitted in a city nursing home — has been granted bail, she will have to wait to get out of custody as   has already filed a production warrant against her at a special ED court in Kolkata. 
 
 She will have to remain in custody till her lawyer files a recall prayer and the same is granted by the court.
 
 “We have argued that Manoranjana had signed a contract with the Saradha boss Sudipta Sen and contractual obligation does not involve criminal liablity. The apex court has taken cognizance of that,” said Biplab Goswami, lawyer of Manoranjana.
 
 The Supreme Court on Monday reportedly mentioned about Sanjay Chandra vs CBI case, where it was observed that deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment unless it is required to ensure that an accused person would stand his trial when called upon.
 
 Earlier, K Raghavacharyulu, the CBI counsel said, “Manoranjana had been feigning ailments without suffering any incarceration in the real sense.” He had also pointed out that the trial court and the   had rejected her plea earlier.
