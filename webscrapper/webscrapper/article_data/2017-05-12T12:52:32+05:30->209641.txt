  The decision to lodge the FIR was taken after a preliminary probe during which the Sheikhpura DM said the dministration issued the cheque of the private bank after confirming that its account in the bank had a balance of Rs 1.05 crore. There was, therefore, no reason for the bank to dishonour the cheque, said a press release issued by the state government.
  
  According to the release, the DM has informed the government that the bank manager had accepted the lapse and tendered apology. The administration is also in the process of blacklisting the bank, the release said.
  
  One of the 25 CRPF jawans who were martyred in a Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma’s on April 25, Ranjeet belonged to Sheikhpura. His wife, Sunita Devi, was on April 26 given the compensation cheque for Rs 5 lakh by the district administration on behalf of the Bihar government.
  
  The cheque was deposited in a nationalised bank, but the amount was not credited into Sunita’s account. On May 6, the cheque was shown to have bounced when her passbook was updated.
  
  The amount was transferred to her account on Wednesday evening after TV channels flashed the news of dishonoured cheque earlier in the day.
  
  While the state government blamed the payer bank, an official of the private bank told TOI over phone that the cheque was rejected by their Noida office after the signature on it did not match with that of the account holder in the bank records.
