NOIDA: The debt-ridden Jaiprakash Associates and   Infratech, the twin   based out of Noida’s Sector 128, have claimed that they have completed 13,800 units at its   project so far. The project originally has 32,000 units including plots.

 Company sources claimed on Monday that of the completed apartments, 9,700 units have been offered for possession. The documents for 4,100 units have already been sent to the Noida Authority to be processed for occupancy certificates, they said. The builder also claimed that it has now only 18,000 apartment units to complete, which it would deliver by 2021 as per the schedule submitted to Rera.
 
 With a hearing in progress at the Supreme Court, Jaypee has so far submitted Rs 650 crore with the treasury of the court and another Rs 100 crore are expected to be submitted by May 10. As per the conclusion of the resolution, the builder now owes Rs 13,500 crore to those buyers who are seeking refund. More than 92% buyers have, however, demanded that they be given flats.
 
 As per company sources, among the bidders who had come forward to infuse funds for the completion of the project and pay bank debts, Lakshdweep Pvt Ltd, a Mumbai-based builder, seems a front-runner with an offering of Rs 7,350 crore.
 
 With the company looking at a liquidation process, the homebuyers on Monday demanded that the company focus fully on the completion and handover of flats and any funds which are infused be fixed in escrow accounts for tower-wise completion of the remaining flats.
 
 “More than the liability of the banks, the first responsibility that should be taken up at present is the pending apartments. The funds should be tied in watertight escrow accounts for tower-wise completion of the pending flats. The resolution procedure has not been done keeping the buyers’ interest as paramount, and we demand complete financial security of our investments,” Pramod Kumar, a buyer at Wish Town said.
