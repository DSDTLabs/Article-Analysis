The MRTS is being developed as a project under the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation. In the first phase, which got the crucial nod on Thursday, an elevated corridor will proceed from   towards the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and finally to Panchgaon Chowk, located on NH 8 near Manesar.

The project will be developed as a public-private partnership, and was first announced as part of DMIC in 2009. Around 140 acres have been acquired for a Metro depot near the Global City Project for the purpose.
 
 According to authorities, the first phase is likely to be launched next month. 
 
 “If everything goes as per plan, we’re looking to launch the first phase by March-end,” said a state government official.
