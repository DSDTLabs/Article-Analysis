AMRITSAR: From April 1, the   will replace the use of plastic carry bags with compostable ones to make its contribution to environment protection.   (PPCB) chairman   held a meeting with the SGPC officials on Thursday to impress upon them to take lead and switch over to compostable carry bags in the Golden Temple complex and in all gurdwaras of the state.

 “Initially all bulk consumers of carry bags will be impressed upon to switch over to compostable ones,” said Pannu.
 
 The SGPC chief secretary, Roop Singh, said that they had decided to discard the plastic bags and switch over to bags made of corn and wheat. As much as 200 quintals of plastic bags are used in the Golden Temple per year along with 65 quintals of plastic bags used for packing of ‘pinni parshad’, he said. Plastic carry bags in the state are a major environmental hazard as these clog drains and sewers leading to health hazards. 
 
 Though Punjab had imposed a blanket ban on the manufacture, sale and use of plastic bags, the supply and use of these could not be controlled as there was a huge demand from public, said Pannu. He said that the government had allowed the import of raw material for manufacturing of compostable carry bags conforming to ISO standards of   Rules-2016. “The PPCB is interacting with some companies to introduce compostable carry bags in Punjab,” said Pannu.
 
 He further stated that he had also convened a meeting of over a 100 plastic carry bag manufacturers of Punjab last week and advised them to shift to manufacturing of compostable ones by using starch granules derived from maize and potatoes. The PPCB chairman said the same machines could be used to make compostable carry bags. However, he said presently compostable carry bags were a bit expensive as compared to plastic carry bags, but the PPCB couldn’t compromise with the degradation of environment. “These compostable carry bags get decomposed into the soil within three-four months,” Pannu claimed.
