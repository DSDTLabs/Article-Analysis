NEW DELHI: The 
  yesterday, said today he won't apologise and doesn't need to, ANI reported.

 "I will not apologise, why should I? First ask him (AI victim) to apologise then we will see," an unrepentant Gaikwad said today, according to ANI.
 
 Gaikwad made this comment even as news broke that almost all private air carriers in India are seriously considering banning the   MP from ever flying with them.
 
  
  
 Yesterday, Gaikwad thrashed a 60-year-old   staffer "25 times" with his footwear because he was "upset" he was given a seat in the 'economy section' of the plane. The plane only had an 'economy section' and Gaikwad had been made aware of it before his ticket was booked. The Shiv Sena MP from Osmanabad also threatened to "throw out" the staffer after the aircraft landed at its destination in Delhi.
 
 Today, the Federation of Indian Airlines ( ) - an umbrella organisation representing IndiGo,  , SpiceJet and GoAir - is scheduled to decide whether it will bar Gaikwad and put him on a 'no-fly list' akin to the ones in many countries like the US.
 
 Air India, which left the FIA some years ago, is also planning its own 'no-fly list' which Gaikwad is expected to inaugurate.
 
 "Airlines staffers - cutting across all carriers - are very upset with what Gaikwad did on an Air India plane. He may get violent again. We also fear that other passengers and/or airline/airport staff may return the favour to the MP. In the interest of safety, he may have to be barred from flying," said an airline official.
