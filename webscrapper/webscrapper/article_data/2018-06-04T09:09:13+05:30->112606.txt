TORONTO: Teenage girls who diet are more likely to engage in other health compromising behaviours, such as smoking and binge drinking, a study has found.

 
 Researchers from   in   found that compared to girls who were not   at the time of initial data collection, those who were dieting were more likely to engage in one or more clusters of other risky behaviours three years later.
 
 “It might seem natural for there to be a connection between dieting and behaviours such as smoking and skipping meals, but the explanation is not so clear for something like binge drinking,” said  , who led the study.
 
 “Our findings suggest that dieting and other risky   may be related to common underlying factors, such as poor body image,” said Raffoul.
 
 “Post-puberty changes often lead to weight gain among girls and there is incredible pressure from social media and elsewhere to obtain and maintain the ideal body,” she added. The study found dieters were 1.6 times more likely to smoke and skip breakfast, and 1.5 times more likely to smoke and engage in binge drinking.
