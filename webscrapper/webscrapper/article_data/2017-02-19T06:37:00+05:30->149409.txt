But when she landed here, she could not find a sponsor and had to stay at the agent's camp for about six months.
 
 When she inquired about the employer, the agent replied he is abroad. The agent then took her to a house in the city and there she worked as a maid. Though she worked for four months, she only received two months' salary.

She was then shifted to a shelter home. Volunteers tried contacting her sponsor, who insisted that he didn't need a maid.
