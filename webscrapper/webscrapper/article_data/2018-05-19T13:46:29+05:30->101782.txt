Actor   is currently in his hometown, Jaipur, to attend the last rites of his mother, who passed away on Wednesday. His mom was battling cancer.   told us, “It has been almost a year-and-a-half since she was fighting cancer, and finally breathed her last on Wednesday.” 

 He added, “I’d heard about umbilical cord, both biologically and poetically. But I have understood that connect in the last year-and-a-half while my mom was battling cancer. She became my daughter, my baby, who I wanted to protect. We are three brothers, and in the last year-and-a-half, she had spent every second of hers with one of us. While there is peace that she is not suffering anymore, there is this heart-wrenching thought that from here on, I can’t call anyone mummy, the way I used to call her.”
