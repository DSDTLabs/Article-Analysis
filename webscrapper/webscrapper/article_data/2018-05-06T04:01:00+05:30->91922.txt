Villagers provided them food when there were no alternative arrangements available.

 As per the plan, midday meal workers will serve dinner on May 11. They will serve breakfast at 11am, tea, lunch as well as evening tea on May 12. “However, the expenses of these meals will be borne by the EC, and only the service of midday meal workers will be utilised,” added the coordinator.

 There are about 3,325 midday meal workers in Dakshina Kannada. However, they will not be given any special remuneration for their services on polling day. “They are paid salaries,” maintained an official.
 
 The services of midday meal workers were first utilized during the last general elections. “We used to face a tough time to find food in an unknown place. We faced a lot of problems, and sometimes survived on liquids or biscuits,” recalls a government employee, who has been deputed on election duty across the district on several occasions.
