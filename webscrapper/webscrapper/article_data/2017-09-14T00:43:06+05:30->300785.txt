Tirupur: The police have arrested on Tuesday a 45-year-old man , who faked as a gold loan provider and swindled about Rs 35 lakh from people of Tirupur and Coimbatore districts .

 The police estimated that he had cheated at least 100 people and so far only 12 of them had lodged complaints with the Tirupur South police. He lured the customers by quoting Quran for providing loan and failed to return the pledged gold articles. Most of the victims belonged to the Muslim community.
 
 The accused who has been identified as B Mohammed Iliyas, a resident of Periyanaickenpalayam in Coimbatore, was a perfume vendor. Known as 'Scent Bhai', he once advertised that he would provide loan against gold, for which the customers wonâ€™t have to pay interest as it is against Islam. Many people mortgaged their gold, ranging from one to seven sovereigns, and received loan from him, said a police officer.
 
 "He would sell the gold and provide the money. He returned the gold to only few people which made others believe him and more people came to ask for loan. According to Iliyas, most of the victims were Muslims from Tirupur, Mangalam and Coimbatore," said the police officer.
 
 Iliyas had been doing this for a year when the borrowers started forcing him to return their gold. Iliyas then went into hiding. The FIR said that Iliyas threatened S Safiyullah, a victim from Big Bazaar Street for asking him to return the gold. Tirupur South booked Iliyas under various sections including 420 IPC and arrested him.
