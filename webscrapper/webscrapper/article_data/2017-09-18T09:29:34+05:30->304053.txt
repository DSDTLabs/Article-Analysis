DABHOI:  ' ­ the 182-metre-tall   Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ­ will not just be a befitting tribute to Sardar Patel, who united all the princely states, but will also turn central Gujarat into one of India's biggest tourist hubs.

 This is what Prime Minister   said after reviewing the progress of his pet project at Sadhu Beyt for the first time after becoming the PM.
 
 Officials of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), which is executing the project, said that the engineering team has erected abo ut 104 metre which will form the statue's waist, even as the bronze panels for cladding the statue have arrived from China. At the workshop, a couple of kilometres away from Sadhu Beyt, workers from TQ Art Foundry , belonging to Chinese firm Jiangxi Tongqing Company , are assisting the L&T workers in assembling the bronze cladding of the facade.
 
 The bronze cladding from China will soon make its way to the actual construction site. “Sardar saheb did not get the credit he deserved after Independence for whatever reasons. But the `Statue of Unity' will be a fitting tribute to him and will draw tourists from all over. Neither do I have a narrow mind, nor I do small jobs. Small, menial jobs do not suit me. That is why when I wanted to build a statue of Sardar Patel, I thought of making it the world's largest. It will be double the size of United States' Statue of Liberty ,“ he said.
 
 Modi said that while South Gujarat had Saputara, Saurashtra had the lions of Gir, North Gujarat had Amba mata temple as tourist attractions but there was nothing in this stretch in Central Gujarat.
 
 “But now, lakhs will travel daily to watch this iconic monument on daily basis and thousands will get employment,“ he said, adding that with the coming of high speed train, tourist flow in the region will increase.
