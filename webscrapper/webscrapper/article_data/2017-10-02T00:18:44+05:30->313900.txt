Aurangabad: In view of growing crime incidents, Aurangabad   police have decided to   the identified criminals and   elements from the district.

 The decision has come after the superintendent of   (rural) Arti Singh found that in spite of preventive actions, some criminals are repeatedly violating the law and indulging in illegal activities including Gutkha, sand trading, gambling, bootlegging and smuggling of banned stuff in the rural areas.
 
 Since taking charge of Aurangabad rural in April, the woman IPS officer has gone all out against all the illegal businesses in her jurisdiction. But off late she has found that the offenders are repeatedly trying to indulge back in to activities.
 
 Singh told TOI, Probably those in to illicit businesses have lost the habit of police clamping down their illegal activities and that is the reason they are feeling suffocated and making futile attempts to restart the businesses.
 
 As a solution to this nuisance, the woman officer has decided to start preparing records of the habitual offenders in terms of illicit businesses and extern them from the district for posing threat to the peace, harmony, law and order.
 
 The Aurangabad rural police have carried out about 200 raids and seizures to the tune of over Rs 2.5 crores made in the past five months, making them second top performer in Marathwada region. Nanded district police, headed by superintendent of police Chandra Kihsore Meena, holds the first place. The official figures of Nanded police in terms of raids and seizures made are more than twice of its Aurangabad counterpart.
 
 Police sources said that due to Singhâ€™s zero-tolerance approach towards illegal activities in her jurisdiction, she has earned herself a contemp of politicians backing some anti-social elements. 
 
 Recently, some local politicians reportedly reached out to the home department with a request to ask Singh to bit flexible.
