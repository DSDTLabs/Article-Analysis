PANAJI: One week into July, which is considered the peak   month, the seasonal total has reached only 961.3mm. The weak monsoon trend of light to   is likely to continue for at least five more days.

 At this stage, the normal seasonal total should be 1,119.9mm. The deficit, which is hovering around 14 per cent, is, however, considered to be within normal range. 
 
 “Till date, the monsoon is not very active, as we had forecast,” scientist at the meteorological centre in Altinho, Panaji, D Sanap, said. 
 
 The monsoon has been weak for about a fortnight, with the deficit on June 30 standing at 13 per cent. 
 
 The trend of light to moderate rainfall has continued with no prospect of immediate reactivation of the monsoon. “The rainfall is light in most areas and moderate in very few areas,” Sanap said.
 
 Rainfall recorded during the last 24 hours, till Friday morning, was 31.8mm in  , while Sakhali recorded 22.2mm, Canacona 21.4mm, Valpoi 16.7mm, and Old Goa and Ponda 14mm each. The other centres received much lesser quantities of rain.
 
 With no notable atmospheric system looming ahead to invigorate the monsoon, the trend of light to moderate rainfall is likely to continue for five days. “It is supposed to be the peak monsoon period, but there is no system to yield heavy rainfall,” Sanap said.
 
 Meteorologists are hoping for a   next week and scanning the horizon for a system that will reactivate the weak monsoon.
