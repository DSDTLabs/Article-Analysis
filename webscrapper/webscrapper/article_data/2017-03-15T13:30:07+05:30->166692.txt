NAVI MUMBAI: Residents have a reason to cheer this summer as the   has decided not to enforce any water cuts as it can supply water for the next 250 days. The   has a gross storage level of 110.067 MCM as against 56.137 MCM last year. The dam has over 88% water in the catchment area. 

 Adequate rainfall last year and the timely decision to streamline the water distribution process have helped the civic body achieve this result, said officials. “The catchment area received over 3,000mm rainfall last year. The good rainfall along with supply and distribution measures ensured that there is no scarcity this year,” said additional commissioner Ankush Chavan.
 
 Water crisis had hit the city last year and the administration had to implement almost 30% water cut from November onwards. But the decision to scale down the supply from 420 MLD to 330 MLD helped   avoid any water cuts this year.
 
 “The 420 MLD water is meant to cater to requirements of a population of 30 lakh but it was being provided to just 14 lakh. Therefore, a decision to restrict the supply to 330 MLD was taken, based on the accepted standards of about 135 litres of water per person,” added Chavan. He also said that as on date NMMC continues to provide 200 litres per person.
 
 The administration also laid emphasis on consumers installing automated water meters and disconnecting illegal connections. The Environmental Status Report (ESR) has calculated 19% of the total water is lost due to leakages and unauthorized connections.
 
 “When compared with other municipal corporations the percentage of water loss is less yet there has been sustained efforts to bring this figure down,” said NMMC city engineer  .
 
 Since May 2016, 10,818 illegal connections have been disconnected. “Of the 1.25 lakh customers, only 1,404 still have to install automated water meters,” he added.
