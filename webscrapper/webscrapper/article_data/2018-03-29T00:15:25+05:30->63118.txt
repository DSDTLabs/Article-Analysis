Delhi government said the 50% power subsidy that it had been giving for three years to those consuming 0-400 units per month would continue unchanged. The   would put no additional financial burden on consumers, it said. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, in fact, claimed that electricity would become even cheaper. He said his government was committed to not allowing the burden of power tariff increase on the common man despite the BJP-led Centre substantially hiking fixed charges. Rejecting opposition claims that, in a few slabs, the consumers would end up paying more, Sisodia said: “There could have been a huge increase in the financial load on consumers because of the fixed-charge hike, but power is going to be cheaper.”He claimed that ever since AAP assumed charge, 80% of domestic consumers had benefited from reduced rates. Claiming that electricity was cheapest in Delhi, Sisodia said the budget, too, had pointed out how the government had strived to provide power to the common man at lower rates. “The Centre has increased fixed charges of all thermal power plants by 50 paisa per unit. This is why fixed charges have been readjusted in Delhi,” power minister Satyendar Jain said. tnn
