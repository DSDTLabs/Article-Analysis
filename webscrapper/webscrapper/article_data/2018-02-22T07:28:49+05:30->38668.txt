BENGALURU: The proposed amendment to the Karnataka Tree Preservation Act of 1976 had earned the wrath of environmentalists and civil groups. On Monday, green activists had launched a campaign urging the government to withdraw the bill. 

 Bengaluru tree doctor   and Dharwad-based environmentalist   met former JD(S) minister  , requesting him to raise the issue in the legislative council.
 
 Some activists had launched an online petition - 'Don't change the Karnataka Tree Protection Act' -addressed to chief minister Siddaramaiah and Bengaluru development minister KJ George.
 
 Retired forest officer   told TOI that irrespective of the content of the amendment, it is better to leave Bengaluru city and other urban centres, with shrinking green cover, out of the proposal. "Similarly, coffee plantations, groves and fruit-bearing trees should not be allowed to be chopped easily," he added.
 
 Former principal chief conservator of forests Sadashivaiah said, "Politicians and groups with vested interests can turn the amendment for their greed. The government should be careful while making such moves pertaining to trees," he added.
