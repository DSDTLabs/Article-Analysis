NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old man allegedly committed suicide in his house at Sanjay Camp near   on Friday night. Police said that Sanjay Kumar's body was found hanging from a bamboo beam in a shack at the JJ colony. No suicide note was recovered from the spot. 

 Family members, however, blocked the road near the   police station, alleging that he had been murdered. They said that Kumar had seen his wife with another man a fortnight back and was having a discord with her ever since. Sanjay's sister Pooja said that after her brother came to know about the "affair", he also went to the police station to register a complaint. The woman and the man were called for questioning, but they had fled from the police station. 
 
  Two days later, the woman returned to Kumar's house and apologised. On Friday night, she called a neighbour to her house and said that Sanjay had committed suicide. The neighbour took Kumar to RML hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. Police were informed by the hospital authorities. Officers said that a probe has been initiated to find out the reason behind the suicide. TNN
