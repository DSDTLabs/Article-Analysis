Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Monday dismissed the application filed by over 300 slum dwellers challenging Buldhana Municipal Council’s notices to them to vacate their premises close to historic   crater. The slum dwellers prayed for more to time to shift to the new buildings constructed for them.

 The court was hearing a plea (No 4549/2009) by lawyer Kirti Nipankar along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana, through counsel Anand Parchure, claiming that Lonar lake was slowly degrading because of pollution and silting.
 
 The notices were issued to applicants as per HC’s directives to the chief officer, collector and the district superintendent of police in Buldhana to take a combined drive to evict all slum dwellers within eight days after giving prior notice. HC also clarified that if applicants didn’t remove the illegal structures on their own, they shouldn’t be allotted alternate accommodation constructed for them.
 
 The dwellers contended 314 tenements were sanctioned for them as per the survey of municipal council in June last year and 188 more members have been increased in their families on the eastern side of periphery. Therefore, they demanded extra tenements for accommodating all of them and refused to vacate their existing structures.
 
 In the last hearing, a division bench comprising justices Bhushan Gavai and Murlidhar Giratkar asked Buldhana Municipal Council to take police protection if needed and demolish the structures. The respondents were told to shift the slum dwellers to the tenements specially constructed for them but had remained unoccupied for the last three years.
