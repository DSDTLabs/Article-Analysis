Behrampore: Asif Iqbal, the lone Congress zilla parishad member from Murshidabad, is in two minds. Asif has got an offer from Trinamool to join. “Yes, I have an offer to join Trinamool. But I haven’t firmed up as yet. I will take a decision after talking to people in my constituency,” the Congress zilla parishad member said.

 Change is in the wind in less than 10 days after the state rural polls were held on May 14. Trinamool leaders are eyeing Asif because his taking the TMC flag will help them join the Anubrata Mandal club of opposition-free zilla parishads.
 
 Efforts have started even at the panchayat samity and gram panchayat levels to woo the 186 Congress winners and 57-odd Independents soon after chief minister Mamata Banerjee dropped hints that many Independents and even those from BJP were keeping in touch with her party.
 
 Taking the cue, Trinamool Murshidabad president Subrata Saha said: “Our party is liberal. Some independents and those from Congress and BJP are in touch with us. We may take them after a go-ahead from the party top brass.” “What can we do if a person elected on a Congress ticket decides to switch loyalties? What is the need of holding polls then?” Murshidabad Congress spokesperson Jayanta Das said.
