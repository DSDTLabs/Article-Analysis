GUWAHATI: Even as the bandh, that started at 6am, ended at 6pm peacefully, the   (NTAC) has called a statewide bandh on Tuesday from 8am to 3pm. Reiterating its stance, the NTAC announced the bandh will continue until chief minister   steps down. On Tuesday, 55,190 students from 280 centres across the state will be appearing for their HSLC and HSSLC, 2017 examinations, conducted by the   (NBSE). The NBSE, in a late night release, said the exams will be conducted as scheduled and extended best wishes to all the students appearing in the exams. In Kohima, the   (AYO) announced that students appearing for the exams will be exempted from the purview of the bandh.
