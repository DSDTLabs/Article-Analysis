AHMEDABAD: A semester II student of the   (MSW) course of   hit himself on his head with an iron pestle at his residence on Thursday, alleging mental harassment by the head of the department, Dr Pradip Prajapati. Prajapati has refuted all claims.

 According to  , the injured youth’s brother,   — a resident of Deshwali Society, Ghatlodia — has submitted an application of complaint for mental harassment against Prajapati. In his application, he has mentioned that his brother David, who is visually impaired and is pursuing the MSW course from GU, has been subjected to mental harassment for the past seven months, primarily by Prajapati.
 
 “He used to comment on my brother’s disability and would demoralize him,” the application says. “David has told me that he was separated from the group and was targeted by the staff. If anything happens to him, Prajapati should be held responsible.” 
 
 A D Gohil, the inspector of  , confirmed that the application had been received and the matter would be investigated. Prajapati, however, said that all allegations were baseless and were attempts to arm-twist him. “In fact, we had submitted a report to the V-C over cyber crime against David and two others and had recommended a police complaint,” he said. “The incident had come to light in March-April and since then there have been attempts to divert attention.”
