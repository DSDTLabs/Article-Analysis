Pune: Students of Film and Television Institute of India have opposed the hike in application   announced by it recently. 

 Refuting the students’ claim,   officials said since they have opted for a common entrance test for Kolkata-based Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute and the FTII from this year, the average amount spent on   fees has come down or more or less remained the same. The new fee structure was displayed on the FTII’s website on December 24.
 
 Rohit Kumar, secretary of the students association, FTII, said, “The combined application fee for the two courses in film and television was Rs 2,150 in 2016. It was later increased to Rs 3,500. But now aspiring students will have to pay Rs 4,000 each for the two courses while applying.”
 
 Students holding placards held protest demonstrations at the institute’s gate on Friday morning. They demanded roll back of the fee hike before January 25, the last date for receiving applications. The common entrance test will be held on February 18.
 
 A statement by the student body said, “In a country where 30% of the population lives below the poverty line, such high fee is unaffordable to a majority of the population.”
 
 Defending the institute’s decision, FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola said, “Till last year, SRFTI and FTII used to conduct separate admission processes. Those applying in SRFTI had to pay Rs 4,000 for the two courses, while they had to pay Rs 3,500 at the FTII. From this year onwards, we are combining the entrance exam. Students applying for a course in film at both the institutes will now have to pay Rs 4,000 instead of Rs 5,500 earlier. Moreover, if they want to apply for all courses in both the institutes, they will have to pay Rs 8,000 instead of Rs 7,500, which is just Rs 500 more.”
