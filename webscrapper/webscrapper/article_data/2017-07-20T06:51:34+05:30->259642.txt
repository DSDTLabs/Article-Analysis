CHENNAI: Almost three years after picking IAS officer U Sagayam to head the one-man commission to investigate the alleged   scam in Madurai district, the Madras high court is set to wind up the commission proceedings by July 31.

 On Wednesday, the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M Sundar indicated that the commission might have come to an end, and directed Sagayam to hand over all the annexures and other materials pertaining to his 600-page report to the court registry in a sealed cover. The bench also directed the Tamil Nadu government to settle all pending dues to be paid to the commission and its officials by end of July.
 
 The bench passed the directions on an application moved by a retired tahsildar, also an official of the commission, to recover his pending salary dues from the state government. 
 
 The bench said: “The advocate-general to pay the pending eight months salary (Rs 20,000 per month) to the retired tahsildar. The aforesaid amount shall be released at the earliest, in any case within July 31. It is also submitted that the actual expenses incurred by the commission for the period between December 1, 2016 and July 31, 2017 shall be cleared subject to submission of accounts supported by the requisite bills and vouchers. The annexure to the report of the commission and the errata shall be handed over to the registrar general of this court who shall keep the same in safety custody in a sealed box.”
 
 On September 11, 2014, the high court passed an interim order appointing Sagayam as legal commissioner in response to a public interest litigation petition moved by   which alleged that the state had incurred a heavy loss due to irregularities in the allotment of mining lease and illegal mining of granite in the state.
