MOHALI: A man from Phase I is charged with raping a neighbour on January 13 after taking her out on the pretext of going to the market.

 The survivor’s father stated in the   complaint after accused   had failed to bring her back by night, the family had searched for her at several places, including a stitching school where she would go daily. 
 
 Next morning, she came home and made some excuse to get away from questioning about where she had spent the night. For the next two or three days, she remained in depression. That’s when the family spotted injury marks on her body and asked her about it.
 
 She told her father that Gobind had taken her to a secluded place and raped her. She told him how the neighbour had also threatened to harm her family, if she dared to disclose the crime. When the victim’s father confronted the accused, Gobind allegedly abused the family and injured the survivor’s mother.
 
 The Phase-1 cops have lodged an   (first-information report) under Section 376 ( ) and launched a manhunt for the accused.
