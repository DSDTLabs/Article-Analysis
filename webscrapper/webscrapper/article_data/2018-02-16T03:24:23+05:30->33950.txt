NEW DELHI: A group of about 200 students staged a silent protest in front of the Institute of   of India on Thursday, after they were declared “fail” in a subsequent list released by the centre the day the results were declared. The students were assured by the   president that their interest will be protected and the matter will be put in front of the central council for redress. 

 On November 14, the final CA results were declared in two lists, with the second list short of around 5000 names. The ICAI regional centres were sent a mail that “certain errors had crept in the branch wise result notification on account of technical errors”. In rectification of these errors, a fresh list was sent that chopped down the number of passed students from about 24,000 to 19,000. 
 
 These 5000 students, who believed they had passed the exam, were declared fail in a span of two hours. Their representation had come to Delhi asking for clarification on their status. “We have worked very hard for the exam. Our parents have out in a lot of effort. They can’t pass us in one go and fail us in the other,” said a student from Jodhpur who had come to the protest. 
 
 Students from across the country— Himachal,  , Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan— had gathered in Delhi for the protest. “We came here two days ago and have been trying to organise a protest. I hope they don’t send us away without addressing our concerns,” said another student from Jaipur. 
 
 ICAI member Suneel Maggo assured the students that the matter would be sent in front of the central council for redress. “The matter is not in my hands, but I am with you in this fight. Your previous litigation was rejected in court, but I will approach a double bench with the matter. We will make sure your interests are protected,” he told the protesting students. 
 
 He asked the students to prepare for their next exam and fill new forms, till the matter was not taken up in court to make sure no time was lost.
