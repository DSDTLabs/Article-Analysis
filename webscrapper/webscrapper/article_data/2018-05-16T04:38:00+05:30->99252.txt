Ahmedabad: The Dhoraji municipality chief has asked the Gujarat high court to set aside a no-confidence motion proposed against him on the grounds that a civic body president cannot be removed for one year. The petitioner, Damji Bhasa, who was elected on February 19, submitted that the no-confidence motion proposed against him by 15 elected members of the civic body violates orders of the apex court and the high court. Bhasa stated that the no-confidence motion against him is against democratic principles as it has been moved before completion of a year. After hearing the plea, HC judge A J Shastri posted hearing of the case for June 13 and granted a stay on the no-confidence motion.tnn
