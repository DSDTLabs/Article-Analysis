PATNA: The   (NIA) on Thursday got 10-day remand of  , who had allegedly planted bombs on Ghorasahan and Nakardei rail tracks in   district. The remand was granted by special   court of Manoj Singh.

 While Sharma’s plan to blow up the track at Ghorasahan was unsuccessful, the bomb planted on a track at Nakardei had exploded on December 2. Police sources said Pakistan’s ISI was involved in both the incidents. The terror activities were being commanded by ISI agent Shamshul Huda from Dubai. Huda was later arrested in Kathmandu on February 5. 
 
 Gajendra had surrendered before a court in East Champaran on February 13 while Deepu Kumar and Suraj Kumar, who were paid Rs 25,000 each for Nakardei blast, were arrested the same day. On February 14, the NIA arrested one Rakesh Yadav for his alleged involvement in Ghorasahan incident.

 “With the arrest of Rakesh, the seven persons whose names had surfaced in Ghorasahan, Nakardei and Kanpur rail derailment conspiracies from Indian side are under the custody of police. Five conspirators, including ISI agent Huda, were arrested by Nepal police,” said a source, adding two suspects from Nepal are yet to be arrested.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said the samples of stones from blast spot at Nakardei would be sent for forensic test. “Though the blast took place more than two months back, forensic tests might reveal the type of explosives used in the blast and they would later matched with the report of Ghorasahan blast,” said a police officer, adding no metallic remains of cooker used in the blast have been recovered from the spot.
 
 Sources said NIA would soon lodge separate FIR in connection with Nakardei incident. The first FIR was lodged with Harpur police station on February 13.
