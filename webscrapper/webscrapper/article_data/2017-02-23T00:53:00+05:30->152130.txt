Hyderabad: The TRS on Wednesday said the government will not tolerate anyone attempting to disturb law and order in the state. In response to the day’s developments related to Prof M Kodandaram’s arrest, the government whip in the legislative council, Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, said, “the police waited for one hour at TJAC chairman Kodandaram’s house requesting him to open the door. Since he refused to, they had to do what they did. They took him into preventive custody and released him in the evening.” 

 At a press conference on Wednesday evening, he said it was common for police to take people into preventive custody if necessary. “Even during the Telangana agitation, agitators were taken into preventive custody during the night,” Reddy said. “The government acted firmly today. This is how it will act against anyone who acts against the interests of the state and the people,” he said.
 
 “Kodandaram’s sole motive was to disturb law and order and not the jobs issue. If Kodandaram wanted to hold a rally, he could have done it at Nagole. There was no need for him to insist on doing it at Indira Park,” he said. 
 
 He further pointed out that chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao would keep his promise of providing one lakh jobs to youth of the state. He said already 34 notifications had been issued for jobs, and among them from 24 notifications jobs had been filled.
 
 MLC Prof M Sreenivas Reddy said it was KCR who made Kodandaram chairman of TJAC. “If he wanted to lead the agitation, he could have floated Kodandaram JAC with his name. But TJAC was everyone’s body to spearhead the agitation,” he said.
