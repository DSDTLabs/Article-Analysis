THANE: Residents from the lake city finally got some respite from the humid and hot climate as the temperature dropped to 19.3 degrees Celsius on Monday.

 The mercury levels that have been hovering between 37 degrees Celsius during the day and around 24 degrees Celsius at night, dropped by almost 5 degrees over the past two days. 
 
 The maximum temperature recorded in the city was 31 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the minimum dropped to as low as 19.3 degrees Celsius on Monday.
 
 Rutuja Shetty (24), an Upvan area resident, said, “It had turned really hot since the last few weeks. We were facing summer climate in winter. Stepping out in the afternoon was unthinkable because of the heat. The nights, too, were warm. I hope we get these short spans of cold all through the long summer months as well.”
 
 Meanwhile, meteorologists assert that the fading away of the cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan has resulted in the inflow of cold northern winds, thus cooling the air by around four to five degrees. They, however, predict that the relief will be short lived as the heat will resume after around 48 hours.
 
 Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at skymetweather, said, “For the last few weeks, the cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan had blocked the cool northern winds from reaching Maharashtra. With that fading away, the temperature has dropped by around 10 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan and around five degrees Celsius in various pockets of Maharashtra, including the  .”
 
 “However, there is a western disturbance brewing up over the Arabian Sea which is bound to increase the mercury levels after around two days,” he added.
 
 However, residents wish that the pleasant   continues to prevail at for sometime. ‘‘This year, we hardly had any winter. It was unbearably hot and humid. If this is the case now then by April and May it may just get worse,’’ said Arundati Patil.
