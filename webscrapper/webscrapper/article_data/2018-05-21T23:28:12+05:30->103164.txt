 "An epic song coming your way! I just finished shooting this beautiful iconic 1990s song 'Dilbar' with John Abraham! I'm so excited guys! I have a feeling you are going to love this one. Blessed," Nora tweeted.
 
  
  
 Talking about her experience on the sets, Nora said that, "Doing a remake of an iconic song is always nerve racking because you never know if you can actually do justice to it. Sushmita Sen was iconic in the song and I hope I match up to her. I’m so lucky to have got this chance and thankful that Nikkhil Advani sir, Bhushan Kumar sir and milap zaveri sir trusted me to be able to do a song like this. The take on the song is very unique and different. It’s going to be one of the most visually stunning songs, with amazing hypnotizing dance moves I am sure this song will become a rage with the audiences"
 
 John Abraham will also feature in the song, but won't be shaking a leg in it. Although he did have something to say on the remake of the iconic track, "When I heard the powerful script of Satyameva Jayate I knew that we had most of the ingredients that are required for an out and out commercial masaledaar film. With the addition of Dilbar, one of the most catchy songs of the 90’s and the way it has been stunningly picturized by Adil and Nora I am certain we have a winner."
 
 Directed by Milap Zaveri, Satyamev Jayate also stars Manoj Bajpayee in a crucial role.
