LUCKNOW: In the run-up to  , defections and rebellions make news left, right and centre. However, the winning record of the party a person defects to may not be impeccable in all cases.

 Most   MLAs who switched over to   last year had the party's stellar performance in the Lok Sabha elections in mind and not the 2012 assembly election results.
 
 Data from the   shows that on all the 12 seats where BSP legislators joined the saffron camp, BJP had an average vote share of less than 10%, as compared to over 31% of BSP in 2012.
 
 In fact, in Mallawan constituency of Hardoi, BJP's vote share was less than 3% while then-BSP MLA Brijesh Kumar got nearly 31% votes.Kumar has now crossed over to BJP.
 
 Cut to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the picture turns on its head. Data shows that in all the said assembly segments of parliamentary constituencies, BJP's average vote share sky-rocketed to 42%, thanks to the Modi wave, while BSP's plummeted to 23%. In the assembly segment of Mallawan, BJP's average vote share rose to 50%, while BSP got just half--25%.
 
 Political experts say that the formula of Lok Sabha elections might not apply in case of assembly elections when caste and other local factors determine the performance of a candidate.
 
 “But certainly , a general popularity of BJP was at play in driving BSP legislators to make the switch to the saffron brigade,“ said political commentator JP Shukla.
 
 “The changed equations of BSP legislators with their boss   only triggered their movement. They could have switched over to other parties but they chose BJP because of its popularity, at least then,“ he said.
 
 Moreover, a gradual social change too, experts said, might have had BSP legislators to look at BJP.
 
 “Everyone is using smart phones and internet. Even BSP cadres are taking to social media platforms to reach out to the party's core vote bank,“ Shukla said.
 
 SP MLAs Kuldeep Senger (Bhagwantnagar) and Aridaman Singh (Bah) switched to the BJP camp despite the saffron brigade's poor performance in 2012. Aridaman had got 54% votes while BJP's candidate got only 1.31% in 2012. SP MLAs Guddu Pandit (Debai) and Mukesh Pandit (Shikarpur), who are planning to contest on an RLD ticket, are also cases in point to show the strange change in political preferences. Pandit got 34.37% votes while RLD's Pramod got only 0.81% votes in 2012. In 2014, RLD's share in Debai was barely 1%.
 
 RLD MLAs Pooran Prakash (Baldev) and Dalveer Singh (Barauli), who switched over to BJP, also show a similar trend. In Barauli, for example, RLD got 39.43% votes in 2012 while BJP managed less than 4%. In 2014, RLD did not contest even as BJP's vote share soared to 52%.
 
 However, this may not apply in the case of a few other defected MLAs. BSP's Ayah Shah MLA Ayodhya Pal, for instance, was denied a ticket by Mayawati. He chose SP, which had 26% vote share in 2012 and only 13% in 2014. In contrast, BJP had a vote share of 50% in the same assembly segment during 2014, even as BSP came in second with 30% vote share.
 
 Heavily dented by rebellion and desertions by its ranks, the BSP has also had a few turncoats walking into its camp. Congress heavyweight from Suar assembly constituency in Rampur crossed over to Mayawati's side though BSP performed badly , getting only 15% votes in the constituency in 2012.BSP's performance in Suar segment was worse in 2014 when its share stood at 7%.
 
 Similarly , Congress MLA from Tiloi Mohammad Muslim joined Mayawati despite BSP getting only 12.9% votes in 2012 and 6% in 2014.
 
 Congress MLA from Syana assembly seat Dil Nawaz Khan changed sides in favour of BSP which got 25% vote share in 2012 but only 15% in the same assembly segment in 2014.
