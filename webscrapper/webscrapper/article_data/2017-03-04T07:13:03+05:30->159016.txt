Despite facing adversities such as  , the government has produced a budget without increasing taxes. It is difficult to find faults in T M  's budget for the next financial year. Also, the budget has given major thrust to two sectors ­ education and infrastructure ­ which is the need of the hour. As far as the education sector is concerned, the creation of new posts for teachers is a welcome decision.
 
 Also, the updation and upgradation of IT infrastructure in colleges was recommended by the higher education council during the tenure of the previous UDF government. It had conducted a detailed study with the help of IIIT and submitted a report. So the present government will not have to spend time to find the requirements for this exercise.
 
 Also, substantial funds have been earmarked for universities, but one thing we have to understand is that it is not the lack of funds that was causing hindrance to the development of universities.
 
 Even when there was no shortage of funds, the lack of additional effort had hurt universities. This needs to be addressed, along with providing funds. The highest allocation is for the agriculture university as the government would have felt that more research was required in the field of agriculture.
 
 The focus on infrastructure development by involving non-resident Keralites (NRKs) is a commendable step as most of them are willing to invest here.
 
 But, two things must be kept in mind while trying to fetch Rs 12,000 crore for the construction of hill and coastal highways.Keralites abroad are mostly professionals and not entrepreneurs. This was evident when investment from NRKs were sought earlier for Kannur airport project. So the government will have to ensure that they accept small investments in the range of two to three crores from NRKs and ensure that their money is safe as their investments would be their savings.
