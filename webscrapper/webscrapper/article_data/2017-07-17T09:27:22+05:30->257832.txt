CHANDIGARH: In September, the   will submit its   to the   on a   between Delhi and Chandigarh. Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF) has two proposals.

 The company proposes a speed limit of 160 or 200 kilometres an hour after track modifications. The estimated cost is Rs 45 crore for each kilometre. Chandigarh and Delhi are 244 km apart by train. Northern Railway general manager R K Kulshrestha said the SNCF report will have to pass review.
 
 For increasing the speed up to 200 kmph, the company proposes to straighten ten sharp curves, three of which are between the Ghaggar river and Chandigarh, speed limit over one of which is 70 kmph. The bridge over the Ghaggar is old and the pas sing trains must keep below 90 kmph.
 
 Between Lalru and Dhap par is a reverse curve, where the speed limit is 100.At the Panipat railway station, tra ins cannot accelerate because of a sharp curve. For new speed, the track will have to be re-laid. Over the two pointend crossings near Ambala and Delhi stations, the speed limit is 15, since many tracks enter the stations. For the semi-high-speed corridor, this is another obstacle.
 
 The 200-kmph passage will require not only track modifications but also lightweight coaches and high-power engines. One of the prominent suggestions in the report is about barricading the corridor to maintain the speed. The signalling system over this stretch will also have to be changed to implement the project, says the report. During the survey , the company counted passenger footfall at the Chandigarh station, besides the number of platforms and services provided at the station.
 
 The proposal was mooted in 2014, when then railway minister Mallikarjun Kharge announced to explore the possibility of running semihigh-speed trains between Chandigarh and Delhi.
