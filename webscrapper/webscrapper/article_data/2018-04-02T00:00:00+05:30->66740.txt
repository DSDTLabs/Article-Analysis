Rocking Star   says that the biggest boon that we have is the right to elect the leaders who take care of us. Kickstarting our campaign   Maadi, ahead of the   state assembly  , he cites his reasons why every citizen should choose to vote.
“I was waiting, as a youngster, to get that power to vote and I have, since then, always been actively exercising my power to vote every single elections. It has been a great feeling. Everyone should vote without fail, You’re as good as a dead citizen if you don’t exercise your power to vote. I do not understand how people find it cool to be ignorant and say that they do not understand politics and that they have no interest in the elections. This is their elected leader that they are talking about. They should know this and it is their responsibility. One needn’t have views on every single happening, but they should have a basic idea because they belong to this country. People pay so much of importance to the finer details when they are hiring someone for their office or home. But they display absolute carelessness when it comes to choosing their elected leader. This is a person who is being paid a salary with our tax money to take care of our area, city or state. If people do not vote, they have no right in complaining about the state of affairs around them either. 
 Every vote counts and people need to understand the importance of that. In a democracy, voting defines the existence of a citizen. Someone who doesn’t vote shows that he or she does not care for what is happening and is not responsible as a citizen. People should ideally go and exercise their power by opting for the ‘None of the above’ option rather than walk away saying they don’t like the people standing for elections. This will also send the message across that they are not happy with the options available.”
