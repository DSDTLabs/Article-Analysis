CHANDIGARH: A day after results showed that 19 of 100   students failed in the MBBS final-year exam this year, students wrote a letter to the heads of the medical college’s departments and   vice-chancellor on Tuesday, alleging that results were leaked and manipulated.

 Even senior medical teachers of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, wrote to the director-principal, questioning how “enormous” marks were allotted to those who failed by 8-10 marks. As per the  , only up to 5 grace marks are allowed to candidates who fail in a subject. “As these   are conducted by PU, we have asked our director-principal to let us know from the university how can so many marks be given,” said a faculty member at the GMCH.
 
 The students have not revealed their names in the letter, and have written that a request to grant grace marks was sent to the VC and signatures of all students on it were forged. The letter says that the request for grace marks was sent to the VC days before the declaration of the results. The result of final-year MBBS (professional) was declared on Monday. GMCH director-principal Dr B S Chavan said he had not received the letter, but would inquire about the allegations. “As a director principal, I am not authorised to grant grace marks. Students might have sent a request to the VC. I will see how many applied and got the marks,” said Dr Chavan.
 
 Students questioned the credibility of an examination where those who were weak in studies were able to pass. Sources informed that though 19 students had officially failed in the subject of medicine, the actual number of those who could not clear the exam was 29. In surgery, sources said, 17 had failed, but the final result showed that 7 could not pass the exam. Besides, four students have failed in paediatrics and three in gynaecology. The VC remained incommunicado.
