Nearly after two decades, veteran actor   and filmmaker   are teaming up for the forthcoming massive project  , which was officially launched last year in the reality show Bigg Boss Tamil. While the film is slated to go on the floors later this year, an interesting news has surfaced on the internet.

 
  
 In a recent interaction with a news channel, Kamal Haasan revealed that ‘Indian 2’ will talk about the current politics happening in the country and that he would convey his views on various topics through Shankar. It must be noted that the makers initially planned to start the shoot in June at   in Hyderabad. However, Shankar reportedly got busy with the post-production work of the upcoming sci-fi thriller ‘2.0’. If reports are anything to go by, Shankar is expected to begin work after Kamal Haasan completes shooting for the reality show Bigg Boss Tamil season 2.
 
 
 It’s worth noting that ‘Indian 2’ has various writers like Jeyamohan, Kabilan Vairamuthu and   jointly penning the dialogues.
