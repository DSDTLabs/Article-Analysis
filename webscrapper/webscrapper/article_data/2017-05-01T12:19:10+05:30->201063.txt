 Killer arrested: Patna junction GRP on Saturday night arrested one Ravi Shankar Akela (34) from New Yarpur in Gardanibagh locality for his involvement in the murder of Manorama Kumari (32), whose body was recovered in two pieces on the Patna-Gaya railway track near Sipara on March 11.
 
 The body was unidentified until GRP on March 18 received a letter from Manorama’s father Janeshwar Bhagat of Daudnagar in Aurangabad through post requesting to lodge a missing complaint. Patna SP (Rail)   said it came to light during investigation that Bhagat, who was shocked after his daughter went missing, died after a few days of sending the letter. “Ravi, a married person, had duped Manorama of several lakhs of rupees in the name of providing her job in the welfare department in Jharkhand. It was also revealed that the accused had used the girl to dupe several others in Aurangabad,” the SP said. Mishra said when Manorama started pressurising Ravi for marriage, he hatched a conspiracy to kill her.
