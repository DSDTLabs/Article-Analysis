Jaipur: The crisp Rail Budget presented by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal is going to be meaty for the North Western Railway (NWR). With a good allocation of funds, the authorities at the NWR are upbeat and expecting the completion of electrification work on Delhi-Ahmedabad and Jaipur-Sawai Madhopur routes by the end of this year. Besides, CCTV cameras will be installed in major trains including Shatabdi Express (Jaipur-New Delhi) and Rajdhani Express (Jaipur-Ahmadabad).

 Goyal has proposed for electrification of 6,020 kms of rail network in the country.
 
 “Out of this, the NWR has been given a task to compete the electrification work of 930 kms. It is going to be a boon for the passengers travelling between Delhi and Ahmadabad via Jaipur. We expect that the electrification will decrease 90 minutes of the total time taken by the train between Delhi and Ahmadabad. Also Jaipur-Mumbai route will also improve with the completion of electrification work from Jaipur to Sawai Madhopur as Sawai Madhopur to Mumbai route is already electrified,” said a senior NWR officer.
