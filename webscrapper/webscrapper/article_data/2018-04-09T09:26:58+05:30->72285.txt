CHANDIGARH: Panjab University is going to strengthen the   promotion cells in its affiliated colleges in the city. Currently, there are 18 research centres in nine city colleges. However, these cells have not convened even a single meeting to strengthen the research centres operational in these colleges. Contrary to this, the research promotion cell in the university is active and holds monthly meetings to resolve issues related to research including that of the research scholars.

 
  
 This issue was discussed in a meeting of the college development council (CDC) held on April 7. When the request of the chairperson of the department of education, PU, for the grant of Rs 20,000 for holding a workshop for research supervisors came up, Dr Dalip Kumar, PU, fellow and associate professor at the Government College for Girls, Sector 42, raised the issue that the research promotion cells in the colleges should be strengthened. These centres came up in 2013 with an idea to strengthen the research in the colleges. 
 
 “The research promotion cells in the colleges need to be strengthened to boost research output in the colleges. The enrollment in the research centres of the colleges is fairly well. However, we need to strengthen them. We also need to collaborate on research projects with the research promotion cell of the university,” said Dalip. 
 
 On the research parameter,   topped among the city colleges in the   (NIRF) 2018. The Research, Professional Practice & Collaborative (RPC) rank of the S D College was 118, which dragged its overall ranking to 82 in the NIRF 2018. However, Govt Post-Graduate College for Girls, Sector 11, scored a zero in its research parameter and ranked 405 in RPC. Post Graduate Govt College for Girls, Sector 42, has a research centre of zoology. Govt College for Girls, Sector 11, has a research centre of chemistry. SD College has research centres of biotechnology, chemistry and physics.
