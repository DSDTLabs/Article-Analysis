VADODARA: An   at   for   off Rs 48.1 lakh from his employers’ accountant over a period of two years. When the accused   was confronted by the owner of the company, he promised to repay the entire money which he never did.

 The complainant Utkasrsh Hathi, who has his office near Kalaghoda and deals in plastic granules and other raw materials, told the police in his complaint that Shah used to carry out all banking activities for his firm since 10 years. Hathi said that he and his other partners had laid complete trust on Shah since he used to work hard since the beginning. Besides carrying out banking transactions, Shah was also responsible for generating passwords for Hathi for netbanking and other online transactions.
 
 In April last year when Hathi and his partners checked their bank statements, they realized that money amounting to Rs 48.1 lakh was siphoned off their bank accounts between April 2015 and April 2017. The firm’s partners then asked Shah to show them his bank accounts’ statements. It was then learnt that Shah had transferred the money to his two accounts after which he accepted his fraud.
 
 Police said that after transferring the amount, he would make an entry of withdrawal by any of the three partners so that nobody would question him. Shah had then promised to return the money as soon as he could. In October, he gave a cheque of the entire amount which was returned by Hathi’s bank for want of balance in Shah’s account.
 
 Shah then kept making excuses and did not return the money forcing Hathi to approach the police. Cops had taken Hathi’s application to register the complaint and after verifying all the evidences against Shah they booked him under sections 406, 408 and 409 of Indian Penal Code which deals with criminal breach of trust.
