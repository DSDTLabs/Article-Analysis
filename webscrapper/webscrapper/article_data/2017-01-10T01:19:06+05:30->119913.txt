CHENNAI: It was a week of fun, frolic and festivities at  's  , which ended on a high note as   put the finishing touches to a grand finale on a packed Sunday night. From melodious tracks to party beats, the popular singer amped up the energy levels of the crowd that had gathered in hundreds at the open air theatre. 

 While the singer started off with the more recent tracks like 'chaar kadam' from PK and 'aaj unse milna hain humein' from Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, his popular hits 'deewangi deewangi,' 'jab se tera naina,' 'one love' and 'koi kahe kehta rahein' (Dil Chahta hain) had the crowds up on their feet and dancing to the tunes. While the students let loose, the older members in the audience couldn't help but groove to the music. Cell phones were put to full use as the audience carried out live streaming sessions of the concert, shot selfies and waved their torchlights in the dark. Jugalbandi sessions between the singer and his band members also highlighted the superb musical skills of the performers. The singer, as a brand ambassador against tobacco, also put in a word of advice for the young crowd to abstain from smoking before he launched into the final part of the evening where he rewinded to his initial hits - 'tanha dil' and 'bhool jha.' 
 
 Saarang, the largest student run fest in the country, had a number of stellar performances during the week including Sid Sriram, Sudha Raghunathan, dancer Vineeth, Swedish metal band Katatonia, EDM perfomers Marnik and Sartek. While the fest followed popular traditions like the 'lonewolf quiz,' it also brought in some new elements like food fest, gaming zones and comedy shows.
