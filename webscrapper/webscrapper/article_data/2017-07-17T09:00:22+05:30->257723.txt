TRICHY:  , called ‘Mudhumakkal Thazhi’, estimated to be over 2000 years old, have been unearthed near Karur. The archaeological remains were found in the Government Elementary School premises at Mavadiyan in the Karur municipality limit. 

 Construction workers stumbled upon the remains, while digging below 10 foot to lay the foundation of an overhead tank for the school. The headmaster informed the district administration which sent a team for inspection. The team, which carried out the survey, found pieces of three urns and mortar bricks. 
 
 Although the exact age of the urns can be ascertained only after a detailed and in-depth analysis, officials from the state archaeology department said that they are at least 2000 years old. 
 
 “The history of Mudhumakkal Thazhi is over 3000 years old and these pots should be at least 2000 years old if we go by the black and brown colour,” said  , curator of   of the state archaeology department. He said that it was an ancient Tamil practice by family members to create a huge earthen pot called Mudhumakkal Thazhi to bury old people in it when they die.
 
 “Pieces of bones that have been found with the pots further add value to our theory of it being Mudhumakkal Thazhi,” he said, adding that the site has been disturbed causing damage to the remains as the place had been dug 10-12 feet deep for construction. “We are going to send a report to the commissioner of the state archaeology department,” added Nantha Kumar. 
 
 Kodumanal in Erode, Thandikudi in Kodaikanal, Aathichanallur near Thoothukudi are a few places where earthen pots have been discovered in the state.
