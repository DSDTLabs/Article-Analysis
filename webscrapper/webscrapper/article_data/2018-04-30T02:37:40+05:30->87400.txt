NEW DELHI: After a night of   marches by the Left-wing groups and   students, the ABVP burnt an effigy against the Left-wing group’s “guerrilla   on freedom of speech and violence unleashed on students and security guards of  .” ABVP called this an attempt to save the culture of debate and discussion at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

 The effigy burning comes as a response to a scuffle that broke out between members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the Left-wing students of JNU during the screening of a documentary film on ‘love jihad’ on Friday. Both groups then took out a protest march on late Saturday against the “violence perpetuated in the campus” by each other.
 
 While the Left-wing students claimed that the film screening was an attempt at “spreading communalism in the campus, the ABVP, criticising the Left for its “hypocrisy”, alleged that they don’t tolerate freedom of speech and expression of others.
 
 ABVP JNU president Vijay Kumar said that “the ABVP opposes any kind of violence in the campus. The university is the centre of freedom of expression, while the Left is its enemy.” 
 
 ABVP members also said that they will continue fighting for justice of students.
 
 Both groups have filed police complaints against each other where the ABVP has alleged that former JNUSU president Mohit Pandey ran his car over a guard on Friday night.
