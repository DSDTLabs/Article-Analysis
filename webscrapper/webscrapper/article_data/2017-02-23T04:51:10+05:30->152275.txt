VADODARA: The traffic department has started a drive against private vehicles ferrying people between   and Ahmedabad.

 The crackdown has brought some relief to the commuters passing from the area.
 
 The traffic department detained 64 cars in January and this month, 42 cars were detained until Tuesday. A senior police official said that to end the menace of these cars, the now running   of the state transport ( ) department has been started.
 
 The ST department started service few days ago and since has got a good response from the regular goers to Ahmedabad. 
 
 However, few cars continue to ferry the passengers due to the irregular timings of the Metro Link Service.
 
 Also, the traffic department has continued with its action against the auto rickshaw drivers in the old city area. “Due to narrow roads in the   area, the notification banning auto rickshaw during peak hours in old city area is still in place. This has eased the congestion there,” said assistant commissioner of police (traffic), S D Rathod.
 
 The move to ban the auto rickshaws had come after residents and shopkeepers in old city area complained of severe traffic snarls. The auto unions had however opposed the move and said that it will burn holes in the pockets of auto drivers.
