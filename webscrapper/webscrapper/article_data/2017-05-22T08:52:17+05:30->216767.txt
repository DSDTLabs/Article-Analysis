Hyderabad: Hours before the  , many roads leading to the venue were choked with   enthusiasts making a beeline to the stadium ahead of time. Commuters were caught in traffic snarls as early as 2pm near Uppal, witnesses said. 

 One such commuter, who was on the way to her coaching class at ECIL, remained caught at a junction for 25 minutes. "I left early from home to avoid any possible traffic snarls due to the match because this situation arises every time there is a match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium at Uppal. It took me over 45 minutes instead of the usual 20 minutes. I was stuck at the Uppal ring road just waiting to take a U-turn from the signal. The   made it difficult to even understand whether the signal was working or not," said Alekhya A, a college student.
 
 As traffic cops had allowed bike pass holders entering from gates 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to park their vehicles on both sides of the Uppal-to-Habsiguda main road except at the metro rail station site, the road turned into a nightmare for commuters. "To add to the chaos, there was a huge queue of devotees, and vehicles, at the Hanuman temple on the Habsiguda main road. A devotee said that it was an auspicious day and hence there was a beeline of devotees, many of whom had come on bikes and parked it on the roadside. It took nearly 40 minutes to navigate the road," said Naga Raju, a commuter.
 
 While elaborate arrangements were put in place by traffic cops, including diversions, it wasn't good enough, as many commuters demanded better preparations. 
 
 "Residents staying in surrounding areas always face the brunt of matches played at the stadium without having to either avoid going out or get caught in snarls for long hours. Cops should plan better," said Sai Lakshmi, a local from Uppal area.
