NEW DELHI: With the Supreme Court giving just a day to B S Yeddyurappa to prove majority on the floor of the   assembly, opposition parties on Friday again questioned the decision of the governor to invite BJP to form government in the state. Opposition leaders were prompt to welcome the SC ruling. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been leading the opposition bid to stitch together a federal front, said on Twitter: "We have great respect for the verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. We will watch tomorrow's floor test. We, the "regional" parties, will decide our next course of action after that." 

 AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, a former BJP ally, also backed the Congress-JDS bid to form government in Karnataka. He said, "We respect & welcome the verdict of Hon'ble Supreme Court. Governor should have followed the democratic conventions in appointing pro tem speaker. We expect that the spirit of the Supreme Court judgement will be protected." Opposition leaders said they would consider petitioning the President in case the floor test was not done "fairly" while questioning the conduct of the governor. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the party would jointly work with others to defeat BJP and protest against the growing economic burden of the people and communal polarisation.
