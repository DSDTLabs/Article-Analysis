KOLKATA: An   was busted on Thursday with the   (DRI) arresting 11 people from different parts of the city and seizing 34kg   worth Rs 10 crore, being routed from Mayanmar. In another high-value haul—with a local link albeit—the Kolkata Police caught a person, Ramendra Mohan Majumdar, from in front of Big Bazar in Sealdah with a can, containing 2 pound cobra venom, costing Rs 6.5 crore. 

 Acting on a tip-off, DRI Kolkata zone officers started tracking several carriers as they boarded different trains from Mizoram and Manipur to Kolkata. The carriers spread out in various groups, some of them known to each other and some complete strangers, officers said. The DRI kept shadowing them and followed one group to a hotel near New Market on Thursday afternoon. As some of the carriers checked into a room, the sleuths broke open the door and confronted them. A search revealed a few gold bars in the bags they were carrying. 
 
 Led away by the officers, the accused spilled the beans on some of the other carriers reaching Kolkata. While one group of officers waited at the New Market hotel for the next chain of carriers to arrive there to pick up the consignments, another team left for Howrah station. As a train pulled in, the officers caught the carriers but were stumped to find nothing in their bags. However, an officer got suspicious on spotting a few of the carriers limping. They immediately made them take their shoes off and found gold bars concealed inside the soles of their shoes.
 
 Myanmar has over the past few years emerged as one of the largest centre-points of gold  , from where huge consignments have been making their way into Kolkata illegally through Indo-Myanmar border adjacent to Moreh in Manipur and Zokhawthar in Mizoram. 
 
 The topography of the area and the porous land border make it only easier for the smugglers to dodge the authorities.
