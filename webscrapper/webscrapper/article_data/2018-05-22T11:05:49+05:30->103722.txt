GREATER NOIDA: A youth had allegedly fired at his   during a   session that had been organised in Dadri city’s Chitera village in order to settle a land dispute between two cousins on Monday.

 
 Around 20-30 people had flocked to the session that was being held to settle a dispute between Lakshman and Satte, two cousins who have each bought plots of 300 acres.
 
 Satte had allegedly refused to part with a portion of his land to allow his cousin Lakshman to construct an approach road towards his plot. As arguments heated up during the panchayat session on Monday, Satte’s son Akshay, who is 22 years old, allegedly shot at Lakshman, who ducked to save himself. Th e bullet missed him by a whisker.
 
 Lakshman’s son Sanjay said the panchayat was called in the presence of the former pradhan Rajbir Singh and his successor Rishi.
 
 Rishi confirmed that a shot had been fired but there was no injury. “The matter escalated and the two parties had heated arguments. Suddenly, Akshay fired a shot but it missed the target. The matter was later resolved,” he said.
 
 Lakshman’s younger son Sonu called police and a PCR van took Akshay and Sonu to the police station.
 
 However, the parties arrived at a compromise and no FIR was lodged.
 
 Dadri station officer Shavez Khan said he had not received any complaint from any side. 
 
 “Both parties had come to the police station and settled the matter mutually,” he said.
