CHANDIGARH: A day after hiking VAT, excise duty and licence fee under the new state excise policy, finance minister Captain Abhimanyu on Monday presented a   of Rs 1,02,329.35 crore for the financial year 2017-18, an increase of 13.18% over the budget estimates of the current year at Rs 90,412.59 crore. 

 It is for the first time in Haryana that the budget has crossed the figure of Rs 1 lakh crore, excluding foodgrains procurement. The budget outlay of Rs 1,02,329.35 crore comprises 21.88% as capital expenditure at Rs 22,393.51 crore and 78.12% as revenue expenditure of Rs 79,935.84 crore.
 
 Reading out his third budget proposals, Abhimanyu said the gross state domestic product (GSDP), which touched the 8.7% mark in 2016-17, will reach 9% during the next financial year. In his more than one hour speech, the minister claimed that the per capita income (PCI), which was 4% during the Congress regime, has now rebounded to 7.5% in 2015-16 against the national average of 6.6%. 
 
 In its populist measures, the government also proposed to launch a scheme in the name of Sir   to develop around 1,500 villages having population between 3,000 to 10,000 by providing necessary physical, social and economic infrastructure facilities on a par with urban areas. A sum of Rs 5,000 crore has been proposed for this purpose. Another scheme in the name of Mangal Sain, RSS ideologue and former deputy chief minister Haryana, has also been proposed to create modern infrastructure in urban areas for which Rs 1,000 crore has been allocated.
 
 The minister also claimed that Haryana’s geographical area is 1.34% of the country’s total area and has 2.09% of country’s total population, yet its contribution to the national GDP is 3.6%. During the last few years, not only the economy of Haryana has become strong as compared to Punjab, but the size of the budget has also been increased manifold, he added.
 
 Reactions:
 
 “The BJP government has led Haryana to the verge of bankruptcy. The state debt has almost doubled to Rs 1,25,000 crore in the last two years. Paralysis of governance and internal bickerings has brought the state administration to a standstill. The budget reflects this malady.” - Kaithal MLA Randeep Singh Surjewala, media cell incharge,  
 
 “Disappointing budget for all sections of society. Will have a debt of around Rs 141,854 crore during 2017-18, which is a matter of serious concern. The government has tried to divert the attention of public from heavy debt by presenting large figures and statistics.” - Leader of Opposition   of INLD
 
 “The budget proposals will help in attracting private investors in large numbers in education, food processing, healthcare and infrastructure sectors, thereby promoting inclusive growth and development of Haryana.” - D S Rawat, national secretary general of ASSOCHAM
 
 “Completely directionless budget, which will only contribute to the inflation.” - former Haryana CM   Hooda
