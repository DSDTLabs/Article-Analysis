CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday dismissed a petition assailing the election of DMK candidate Ma   for the   assembly constituency in 2016. 

 Justice P   passed the order on the plea moved by independent candidate of the constituency S Parthiban seeking to declare the election of Subramanian as null and void.
 
 According to the petitioner, Subramanian had submitted two nomination forms, one on April 27, 2016 and another on April 29, 2016. 
 
 Senior counsel P   for Subramanian submitted that with respect to two nomination papers, it has not been stated how it has frustrated the election process, while there is no dispute that a candidate is entitled to file three nomination papers within the prescribed time.
 
 Recording the submissions, the judge rejected the election petition. tnn
