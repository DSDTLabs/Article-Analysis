Margao: The issue of increasing migrant population in one of Salcete taluka’s smallest villages was raised during the gram sabha held at   on Sunday.

 “Gram sabha members insisted that every ward member prepare a list of migrants residing in their respective localities, in view of the rising crimes being reported throughout the state that are committed by non-Goans,” sarpanch Denica Coutinho told TOI. 
 
 “While a few villagers raised protests about the memorandum sent to the panchayat by the block development officer (BDO) regarding the inclusion of the Any Other Business (AOB) in the gram sabha agenda, a majority of the members felt it irrelevant as villagers could seek the permission of the chair while raising important issues. Members also sought that the panchayat immediately follow up with the authorities concerned, like PWD, on the pending development works such as construction of roads, that has been hampered due to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) issue,” Coutinho also said. 
 
 The annual budget and audit report was also approved by the members. “Villagers also raised the issue of the fish market which was to be constructed utilising the Golden Jubilee funds of approximately Rs 20 lakh. However, the locals want toilets to be included in the project. The proposal to build the ‘tinto’ with toilets was submitted by former sarpanch Cruz Silva, but the panchayat didn’t receive any grants from the government,” deputy sarpanch Rosario Silva said. 
 
 While six of the seven panch members were present, local Congress MLA Filipe Neri Rodrigues was absent.
