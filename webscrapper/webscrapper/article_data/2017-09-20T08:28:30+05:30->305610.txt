GANDHINAGAR: The Congress on Tuesday launched ‘Navsarjan Khedut Adhikar Abhiyaan’ to woo farmers ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections. The party has promised to waive all debt of farmers, provide free water and 16 hours of electricity a day. The party has also promised to give the ‘minimum support price’ ( ) as given earlier by the previous   government.

 The party has started distribution of forms among farmers for their feedback and registration. Sources said that this will give the party a sense of the farmers’ mood before the elections.
 
 Gujarat Congress president   announced the campaign and said that under 22 years of   rule, agriculture in Gujarat had faced the worst crisis. 
 
 “When the UPA was in power, the BJP used to blame the Congress over MSP but under BJP rule, 3.5 lakh farmers have become non-farmers while the number of farmer labourers has increased by 17 lakh,” he said. 
 
 “Employment and investment figures claimed in Vibrant summits have proved a big lie,” Solanki said. “In Soniaji and Manmohan Singhji’s time, the country’s economy survived the worst global crisis. Now under BJP rule, we have become importers of agriculture products.”
