They met at a dinner party at  's Delhi home in 2009, and their relationship, and a celebrity coupling that would be keenly watched in both India and globally, began a few months later.  , the director of films like 'Pride And Prejudice' and 'Atonement', was in India putting together his next project, the period film 'Indian Summer'. Anoushka later revealed that Joe had auditioned her for the role of Indira Gandhi. The film eventually didn't take off, but a transcontinental romance did. "We followed each other around the world to concert halls and film sets across four continents. We moved in together after just three months, and the rest was history," Anoushka had said at the time of their wedding, which happened just over a year later. The couple have two sons, Zubin and Mohan.

  
  
 
 
  Their marriage has been one of the steadier ones in showbusiness, not becoming tabloid fodder like many celebrity marriages do. Which is why, when the news of their split, accompanied by a representative's statement, appeared in the international press, it took everyone by surprise. When we tried to reach Anoushka to confirm the news, there was no denial, only that she has "no comment to make on a matter that is private". 
 
  As the seven-year union comes to an end, we look back at the couple in happier times and retrace their journey.
