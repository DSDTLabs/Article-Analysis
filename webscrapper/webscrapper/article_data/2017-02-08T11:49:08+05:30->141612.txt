AGRA: The   directed the Vrindavan   Parishad and Mathura district magistrate to deposit a compensation of Rs 10 lakh within two weeks for disposing garbage in the Yamuna. The move comes eight months after the   (NGT) ordered the civic authorities to deposit the amount for polluting the river.
 
  The NGT had imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh each on Vrindavan Nagar Palika Parishad, Mathura DM, Rs 1 lakh on UP Pollution Control Board and Rs 50,000 on the state government for "indiscriminate" dumping and burning of municipal solid waste in the temple town of Vrindavan. While the state government and UPPCB deposited the money, the other two agencies approached the SC seeking a reprieve from the NGT’s order. In its order dated January 30, the apex court said, “Before the status report is filed, the amount as required by the tribunal should be deposited in the registry of this court.”
  
  Besides imposing environmental compensation, the tribunal had also directed the Nagar Palika to identify a new site for dumping solid municipal waste within four weeks.
  
  The tribunal's directions had come after a seer   filed a plea stating that the authorities were engaged in ‘illegal’ and ‘unregulated’ disposal of solid waste in the holy city. Shukla’s counsel had earlier submitted photographs showing reckless dumping and burning of municipal waste and alleged that the city’s environment was being polluted due to a lack of implementation of solid waste management rules.
