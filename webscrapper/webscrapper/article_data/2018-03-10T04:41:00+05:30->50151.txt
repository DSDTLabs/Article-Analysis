MUMBAI: The   on Friday cracked the whip against errant establishments in   in Lower Parel. A cafe was sealed and illegal extensions and structures were razed during the drive. The civic body’s action comes over two months after 14 people died in a blaze which spread through two eateries in  .

 The BMC’s ‘G’ south ward office sealed one eatery, Zen Café, which lacked fire safety NOC. Seven tonnes of inflammable silk roll was also seized from the basement of Krishna Silk Industries located on the same premises.
 
 According to Development Control Rules (DCR), basement can be put to only specific use such as for storage of household or other nonhazardous goods, as store room, for bank lockers or safe deposits and parking spaces. “We found huge quantity of silk cloth rolls which cannot be stored in a basement considering these are inflammable. A café in the area was also found to be operating without fire NOC so we immediately sealed the premises,” said assistant municipal commissioner of ‘G’ south ward Devendra Kumar Jain.
 
 Following the blaze at 1Above and Mojo’s Bistro in Kamala Mills on December 29 last year which were found to be flouting norms, the BMC has taken a tough stance against shops and eateries.
 
 When   contacted Zen Café, a supervisor who received the call confirmed the hotel had been sealed. Apart from these two establishments, there were 40 others against whom action was initiated for either illegal extensions or for unauthorized signboards which were demolished.
