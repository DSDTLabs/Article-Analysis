Vijayawada: Measures initiated by Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Devasthanams authorities to ease congestion in the temple have failed to yield positive results.

 Temple authorities shifted the annaprasadam counter to the second floor of Mahamandapam on a trial-basis. The annadhanam counters were shifted from the choultry on Arjuna street as Mahamandapam is closer to the main temple and it was thought the venue would help the devotees to get their meals. The shifting was ordered by executive officer M Padma.
 
 Officials started the annadhanam services on Sunday. Special buffet counters were arranged. However, the devotees had a tough time as no proper furniture was arranged for them. “The dining hall on the second floor is unhygienic. Dirty water was flowing near the entry point. Women and kids were sitting on the floor. No proper dining table was present,” said Lankkoju Venkataramana, a devotee from Puligadda in Krishna District. We waited in long queue lines at the counters as there was severe congestion, he added.
 
 Devotees waiting in darshan queue lines also expressed anguish over the poor arrangements. “We were unable to breathe properly in darshan queue lines. There was a chance of a stampede. Such congestion should not have been allowed,” said Ramana Kumar P, a devotee from Kadiri. Responding to the reports of excessive congestion, temple joint executive officer Achyuta Ramaiah said the new dining hall was arranged on trial-basis and necessary measures will be taken in the future. “Temple EO is seriously monitoring the issue and we will check all possibilities to facilitate devotees,” he said.
