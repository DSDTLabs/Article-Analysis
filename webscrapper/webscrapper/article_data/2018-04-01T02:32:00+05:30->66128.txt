Vijayawada: Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), which failed to implement its resolution of prohibiting usage of   carry bags in the city from January 1, 2018, is searching for an alternative way to check this environmentally unfriendly practice.

 VMC authorities are proposing the introduction of bio-degradable carry bags made of starch in place of traditional polythene bags. The civic body, which is facing problems with tonnes of plastic waste piling up on the streets, is planning to take stringent measures to control this. It may be noted that VMC has earlier asked city-based vendors to use plastic bags below 40 microns. The civic body is conducting a slew of inspectors in the city and are seizing stocks of those vendors who are failing to maintain standards.
 
 In a bid to control plastic usage in the city, VMC is examining chances of introducing bio-degradable carry bags. Health wing of VMC which directed traders in the city to replace carry bags with jute bags later withdrew its proposals considering their cost. “Around 30 per cent of solid waste dumped in the city is plastic waste. We have cleared tonnes of plastic waste piled in canal bunds in the city and are searching for a cheap alternative for this,” said VMC Commissioner J Nivas.
 
 “Rejino plastics, an agency which supplies   carry bags made of starch, claims that these bags can take the same load as ordinary plastic bags. We need to protect the environment and curb the use of plastics,” said Nivas.
