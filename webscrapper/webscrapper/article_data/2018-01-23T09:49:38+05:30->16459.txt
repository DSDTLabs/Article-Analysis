PANAJI: Fruit ripening chambers can help consumers acquire healthy produce and save traders who resort to harmful practices from the authorities punitive action. 

 “Ripening fruits by using chemicals is illegal and harmful to those who consume them,”  , director, food and drugs administration (FDA) said at the third biennial Dr   seminar on “Fruits and vegetables: Food or poison,” in the city. She added that some are ripening fruits near Goa’s border to evade action initiated by   against such methods.
 
 The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, empowers FDA inspectors to impose and recover fines on the spot and also seize and confiscate fruits and food items, a paradigm shift from filing cases in courts against food adulteration. These measures have helped in curbing artificial ripening of fruits, such as bananas, chikus, mangoes and apples, she said.
 
 The FDA director also explained why artificial ripening fruits using calcium carbide or by spraying with, or dipping in, ehtrel or ethephon is bad. The food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI) has a mobile app for public complaints about substandard food.
