PANAJI: A day after former   Vishwajit   joined the BJP, former   municipal councilor and youth leader from Rane’s constituency, Ashish Kanekar, who contested the 2017 assembly election on an AAP ticket, joined the   party.

 Congress has a strong base in Valpoi and is gearing up to defeat Rane in the upcoming bypolls, inorder to try and restore its tally of elected representatives in the state legislative assembly to 17.
 
 Kanekar said he will work for the Congress to galvanise support ahead of the bypolls.
 
 All India Congress Committee secretary Girish Chodankar, who visited Valpoi on Friday, said “Rane hasn’t only betrayed the trust of the party but its voters too”. He accused Rane of trying to project himself as the “self-proclaimed prince” who assumes that people will rally behind him irrespective of the party he joins. Chodankar said, “Rane has hurt the pride of Valpoikars. The bypolls are the right time to give him a fitting reply”.
