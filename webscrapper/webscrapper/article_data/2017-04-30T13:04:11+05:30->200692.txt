MOHALI: When things don't go as planned on the field, keeping the head up is the least one can do. Both   and the   would be experiencing similar sentiments after losing their respective matches against the Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday.

 However, ahead of their clash at the IS Bindra stadium in Mohali on Sunday, they would be eager to forget the past and focus on the job at hand.
 
 Daredevils have immense talent in the fold but find themselves at the bottom of the table with two wins from seven games. Last year, the team started with plenty of promise and faded away towards the business end of the tournament. This year, Delhi have had a slow start and would be keen to lift their game against Kings XI to stay in the reckoning for a place in the knock-out stages.
 
 For that to happen, the Daredevils' young turks will have to embrace consistency and not perform in patches like the way it has been this season.   has been scoring consistently at the top of the order while   has shown the potential to become one of the best all-rounders in the world in this format. But others like   and   will have to raise their performance levels to take their team across the line.
 
 Out of Delhi's two wins, one came against the Kings at home. Therefore,   and his men would be desperately seeking solace against the hosts. But the Kings, with three wins in the bag Â­ aren't pushovers. They may have lost the Friday game against the Sunrisers by 26 runs, but they are ready for Delhi's challenge.
