CHANDIGARH: Giving relief to city residents,   ( ) has imposed a cap on fuel and power purchase cost adjustment (FPPCA) charge to be levied by the UT electricity department.

 The FPPCA charge for a quarter has been limited to a 10% of the approved existing average billing rate of different consumer categories. At present, there is no limit on amount to be recovered and the consumers are being charged upto 30% of the existing average billing rate. The FPPCA charge is the difference between per unit actual cost of power purchase and per unit approved cost of power purchase. FPPCA is a charge added on a per-unit basis to each power bill over and above the regular tariff. The UT electricity department bi-monthly generates bills for domestic customers. The charges are revised after every quarter.
 
 The decision has been taken after the residents raised hue and cry over high FPPCA charge and complex formula used to calculate the charges. For benefit of consumers, they have also revised and simplified the FPPCA calculation. 
 
 As per the order of the commission, the department will be required to submit the FPPCA calculation to the commission at least one week before levying the same on the consumers. The order will come into force from April 1.
 
 UT superintending engineer MP   said the department will not be able to charge FPPCA above 10% of the approved cost. “From next quarter, the FPPCA charges will be on lower side,” said MP Singh. The electricity department caters to 2.28 lakh consumers, who are divided into nine different categories. 
 
 As per official figures, 1.99 lakh consumers are domestic users, accounting for more than 87% of the overall figure. Remaining 23% consumers are divided into commercial, small power, medium supply, large supply, bulk supply, public lighting, agriculture power and temporary supply categories.
