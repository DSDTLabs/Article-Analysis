HYDERABAD:   detectives of Hyderabad commissionerate busted an   routing racket and arrested a BCom graduate from Habeebnagar on Friday. 

 The accused Fahad Ahmed, 30, had been operating the racket from his home on his own for two years.
 
 After receiving alerts from intel agencies about suspicious calls being received from local cell phones, cyber crime detectives of Hyderabad commissionerate began keeping a close watch on such activity.
 
 "We found out that Fahad was indulging in international call routing and causing a loss of crores of rupees to the government," CCS DCP Avinash Mohanty said.
 
 Cyber crime   KCS Raghu Vir said Fahad used to get international calls from clients through internet and would connect them to family members or friends of clients in India by dialling them through local SIM cards. 
 
 "As the call would go to Indian SIM card holders through a local number, only local tariff would apply," the ACP said.
 
 Police seized five routers, call switchers, 100 SIM cards, passports, three knives and five   guns, which are sophisticated, along with pellets. "We are checking if holding such weapons without a licence is legal. We will have to check details of clients to know if Fahad had indulged in anti-national activities," a a cop said.
