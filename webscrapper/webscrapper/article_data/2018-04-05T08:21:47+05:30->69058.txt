 W hat were we supposed to do? We did not have the money to hire an auto or a taxi. So, I carried my husband from our house at Geeta Vihar colony to the CMO's office in Civil Lines. The travel took us a total of four hours each day. Earlier, an NGO refused to give us a tricycle as they said one of his legs is working, said Vimla, 34 .
 
 To get a free wheelchair, a disability certificate is mandatory. "When we first visited the CMO's, we were told certificates are issued only on Mondays. When we went there the next week, officials told us my photograph is required. So we had to return again," said the 36-year-old husband .
 
 Badan, who worked as a truck driver, developed clots in his leg last year, which turned gangrenous and had to be amputated. The burden of medical expenses fell on Vimla, who earns Rs 3,600 a month. "We spent our entire savings, around Rs 7 lakh, on his treatment," said Vimla.
 
 Additional chief medical officer of Mathura, Dr Rajiv Gupta, said, "Badan has been provided a 70% disability certificate."
