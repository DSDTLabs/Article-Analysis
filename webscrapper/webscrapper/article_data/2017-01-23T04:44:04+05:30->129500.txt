NEW DELHI: After a brief hiatus owing to bird flu scare,   is limping back to normalcy with the park witnessing a spurt in births of endangered and exotic deer species.
“Various deer species including   deer, chital, nilgai, sangai, swamp deer, hog deer, chinkara, sambar, brow-antlered deer as well as lion-tailed macaque, hippo and gaur gave births recently,“ curator   said.
 
 The birth of a hippopotamus and a lion-tailed macaque was also recorded, the official said.
 
 The  , a popular spot among children and adults alike, was recently opened after being closed for over three months owing to the death of 13 free ranging birds like painted storks, ducks and rosy pelicans due to H5N8 Avian influenza.
 
 The park has come under scrutiny for a number of animal deaths since the past few years. The zoo had reported deaths of 46 spotted deer last year and caged birds like munia, grey partridge and ringneck parrots. A baby gibbon also died at the zoo recently.
