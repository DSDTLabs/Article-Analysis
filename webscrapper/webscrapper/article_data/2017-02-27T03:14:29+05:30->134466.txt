Noida has transformed from being a city of limited single-screen halls to one with many   and multiple options like IMAX, 4DX, etc. But it's not just the aam aadmi who has been talking about all these options available to the public in Noida, filmstars have taken notice too. On his recent visit to Noida,   expressed delight at Noida emerging as a movie-watching destination in NCR. The actor visited Noida for the launch of a new initiative by a prominent cinema chain. He said, "It's great that so many new kinds of cinema watching experiences have come up in this city in the last year or so. From what I have heard, you have lots of different kinds of unique screens here, which is good for the viewers as they have more options to choose from. Cinema should always be about the viewers."

 When asked if this emergence of screens and more options in Noida was a challenge to the screens in the neighbouring Delhi, Hrithik replied, "It is always good when newer towns and suburbs challenge the bigger cities. Noida coming up with more screens and cheaper shows means Delhi halls will become competitive and pull up their socks. It's certainly great for the average viewer and for the industry."
