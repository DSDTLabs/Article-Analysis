CHENNAI: At a time when the clamour to be included in the caste-based   list grows louder,   minister of state for   and empowerment Ramdas Athavale on Monday said states could explore the scope of providing reservation for poor candidates from forward communities for education and employment. 

 Addressing reporters, he said there were demands from sections of forward communities like the Marathis in Maharashtra, Rajputs in Rajasthan and Thakurs in Uttar Pradesh to give reservation for   members of their groups. “Our government is mulling over this. States like Tamil Nadu, where reservation is 69%, could also explore this front. But we will need a law to make it possible,” he said.
 
 Noting the atrocities against the SC/ST in Tamil Nadu is on the incline, he asked the state government to fast track setting up of an additional 16 special courts to try such cases.
