NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   is going to showcase ‘New India’ to global chief executives when he meets them in   later this month in what will be a first trip by the an Indian Prime Minister in over two decades.

 Modi will kick off his whirlwind visit at a reception on January 22, which will be followed by his address at the plenary a day later and meeting with 120 global CEOs at the business forum. While the two events on January 23 are linked to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in the Swiss ski resort where CEOs and heads of state and governments converge, the government is also looking at a separate interaction of the PM with industry captains.
 
 Modi is leading the largest-ever Indian delegation to Davos, comprising six ministers and over 100 CEOs, which includes finance minister  , commerce & industry minister Suresh Prabhu, railway minister Piyush Goyal and oil minister  , Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and Maharashtra’s Devendra Fadnavis.
 
 On Tuesday, Jaitley and Prabhu met prominent CEOs such as Bharti Airtel’s Sunil Bharti Mittal, ICICI Bank’s Chanda Kochhar and Uday Kotak of Kotak Mahindra Bank to get a feedback on the thrust of India’s campaign. The CEOs suggested various themes and suggested that work in areas such as Aadhaar could be highlighted.
 
 Invest India and the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) are working on a campaign around ‘New India’ that highlights the massive opportunities through a large market, an economy estimated to touch $5 trillion and a middle class of 550 million in 2025. The government wants to pitch India as an attractive investment destination, with strong economic fundamentals and a regime pushing reforms such as GST and improving governance through a “technology-driven transparent” approach.
 
 The “unprecedented” improvement in ease of doing business and one of the most liberal economises for FDI, where 90% of the inflows are via the automatic route, will be the other key themes.
