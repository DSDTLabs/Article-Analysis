MUMBAI: Two days after their break-up, former allies   and BJP leaders have begun a war of words.   on Saturday put the blame of corruption in the BMC on the chief minister while accusing the BJP of supporting dubious contractors and of giving controversial builder   an entry into Rajya Sabha. BJP leaders rubbished Shewale’s allegations, stating that these “threats” cannot stop them from exposing the Shiv Sena.

 Shewale, while speaking at a press conference, said, “The chief minister, who also heads the urban development department of the state government, appoints the municipal commissioner and takes the final decision on all proposals passed in the BMC. So, the chief minister must say who is responsible for corruption [in the BMC].”
 
 While opposition parties in the BMC have raised the issue of corruption in the civic body, the BJP too has been trying to corner its ally, Shiv Sena, over the issue. 
 
 “The BJP has given an entry to Kakade into the party and sent him to Rajya Sabha though he is facing corruption cases,” said the Sena MP. Kakade’s company, Kakade Infrastructure, had invested Rs 10 crore in a firm owned by NCP leader   and the Enforcement Directorate is probing the investment in connection with a money laundering case related to the Maharashtra Sadan scam.
 
 Shewale also mentioned the water tanker scam and alleged that many requests were made by BJP MP  .
 
 In reply to the allegations, Somaiya said, “Shewale is just making a public speech and he does not have any document to prove the allegations. Such ridiculous statements cannot stop me from releasing ‘black papers’ (documents proving charges of corruption against the Shiv Sena). We will make the BMC free of mafiya.”
