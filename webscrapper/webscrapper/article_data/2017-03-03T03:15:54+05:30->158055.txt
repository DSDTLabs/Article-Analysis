AHMEDABAD: As summer starts to set in, the city is seeing more fires. On Wednesay and Thursday, Ahmedabad   (AFES) reported two major fires, at Naroda and Narol.

  AFES said they got a call from  , a chemical unit in Phase IV of Naroda GIDC at 9.30 pm on Wednesday. The unit produces paints and the fire had started from a production unit, after suspected overheating or a spark. The fire engulfed the entire premises in minutes, due to the presence of flammable chemicals. A total of 14 fire-fighting vehicles were pressed into action.
 
 “The main challenge was the metal frame, which was up to three storeys high. The metal heated up and made it impossible to climb it to spray water. Meanwhile, poisonous fumes from burning of chemicals forced the firemen to wear masks. The operation lasted for four hours. Our prime concern was containing the flames. As the unit is surrounded by other chemical units, it could have resulted in a major emergency,” said Rajesh Bhatt, additional chief fire officer, AFES.
 
 The second fire was reported at 11 am on Thursday at a timber unit in Narol. The fire engulfed three nearby units as well. As these premises were full of timber, the fire spread quickly. Officials said they tried to contain the fire and let the stock burn out before flames could affect nearby residential area. Officials suspect a spark or naked flame caused the incident. Some seven fire vehicles were used to douse the flames in a 90-minute operation.
