MADURAI: The fire that raged through a portion of the iconic   here late on Friday night has exposed the absence of safety measures in the place of worship. Streets leading to the temple were crowded with encroachments and park- ed vehicles making access difficult for fire tenders. Questions were also raised about the need for shops on the premises. 

 The fire caused extensive damage to the 7,000sqft, 400-year-old Veera Vasantharayar Mandapam, with a portion of the ceiling caving in. The blaze also destroyed 36 shops on the temple premises. 
 
 " The temple staff had little knowledge about fire-fighting and the premises did not have sufficient equipment to fight fires," temple protection committee state general secretary   said. 
 
 Fire tenders and water lorries had a hard time gaining access as they could come in only through one of the temple entrances - the Ambal Sannidhi," Temple Protection Committee state general secretary T Sundaravadivel said. Madurai collector K Veera Raghava Rao, who inspected the premises on Saturday morning, said five fire engines and over 60 fire service personnel fought for over three hours to put out the fire which started at 10.40pm on Friday and raged till1am on Saturday. He said police were investigating the cause of the fire. Action will be initiated based on the report.
 
 He said only the damaged portion of the temple was cordoned off and darshan was going on as usual.
 
 The fire at the temple has also given strength to a demand to evict all shops from the temple by giving them alternate sites.
 
 Hindu Munnani Madurai district general secretary   said the functioning of 150 shops in the temple was a threat to safety and security of the temple, more so in the wake of threat from a terrorist organisation.
