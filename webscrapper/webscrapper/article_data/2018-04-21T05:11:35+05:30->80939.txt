MUMBAI: Setting a strict precedent, a sessions court has imposed a steep fine of Rs 85 lakh and a jail term of 10 years on a public works department (PWD) section engineer caught taking a bribe. If he cannot pay the fine, he has to serve for another four years.

 It is the highest fine imposed by a special court under the Prevention of Corruption Act, said a senior IPS officer. “Under  , the maximum and minimum imprisonment have been prescribed, but there is no ceiling on fine; it is left to the judge’s discretion,” he said.
 
 Ashok Keshavrao Munde, attached to the Shrirampur panchayat samiti, was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh from a contractor on May 4, 2016, said ACB deputy superintendent Vishnu Tamhane.   had demanded 5% of a bill amount to release a cheque. It had been agreed that the complainant would hand over the bribe to Munde at the   zilla parishad guest house. Munde reached the location and was caught red-handed.
 
 Offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act were registered, and the investigating officer, then deputy superintendent Irfan Shaikh, completed the probe in record time and submitted the chargesheet on September 2, 2016.
 
 Delivering the verdict on Friday, Ahmadnagar sessions judge S U   sentenced Munde to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and handed a fine of Rs 50 lakh for offences under PCA section 13 (criminal misconduct by public servant and abuse of official position). Further, he imposed seven years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 35 lakh under section 7 (public servant accepting bribe). The prison terms would run concurrently.
 
 If Munde fails to pay the fines, he has to further serve time for four years.
 
 The IPS officer credited the quick resolution of the corruption case to the fact that the ACB sleuths had submitted the charge sheet in less than four months from the date of offence and the court, too, disposed of the case on priority
