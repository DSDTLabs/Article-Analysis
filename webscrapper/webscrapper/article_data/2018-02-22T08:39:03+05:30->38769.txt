BENGALURU: The excise department's move to replace the paper-based hologram-embedded excise adhesive labels ( ) on liquor bottles with polyester stickers has run into a controversy with greens moving the   high court, claiming it to be "costly and not environment-friendly". 

 The matter is coming up for hearing on Thursday.
 
  The EAL, also known as excise tax bonds, are used as the excise department's seals on liquor bottles and are affixed in the distilleries in the presence of excise officials. These EALs, measuring 27x75mm, contains batch number, 2D bar code, the manufacturer's name and 14 other details about the liquor bottle. 
 
 The state government had formed a nine-member committee in 2014 to suggest changes that could be incorporated in EAL to avoid tampering. The committee studied label designs from different states and suggested the use of polyester. The excise department invited tenders for polyester-based labels.
 
 B Ramprasad, a social worker at  , a non-government organization for waste management, have filed the PIL opposing the government decision. 
 
 "Polyester-based adhesive labels are an environmental hazard as 32 crore   would go waste every month. The said labels are small in size, cannot be used for multiple purposes and times, are not cost effective to collect and hence non-recoverable. The polyester labels are   once thrown way and cannot be recycled," the petitioners said in the PIL.
