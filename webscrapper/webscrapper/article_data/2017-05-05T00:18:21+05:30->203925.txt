MUMBAI: Only in India, authorities throw caution to the winds and are unconcerned about  , the   said on Thursday.

 A bench, headed by Justice Vidyasagar Kanade, made the oral observations while it declined to stay the collector’s order to remove a 90-ft   of a sugar factory, Siddheshwar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana, which is in the approach of the   at the  . “There can be no compromise. What has to go, has to go,” said Justice Kanade.
 
 Senior advocate Ram Apte, appearing for the sugar factory, admitted the chimney’s height is above the permissible level, but attributed it to disputed calculation. He said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in Mumbai had given its no-objection certificate and the factory has now approached the AAI Delhi seeking relaxation.
 
 To this, Justice Kanade said, “Only in India this can happen. I have travelled all over the world and realized that only in our country authorities throw caution to the winds without any care for passenger safety norms. You want accidents to happen?” 
 
 The bench said it is ‘well-settled’ that height restriction in respect of buildings in the approach of the runway and funnel areas cannot be reduced. “These restrictions have been imposed taking into consideration the safety of passengers in aircraft and people residing in areas near airports,” said the bench, adding that the court has earlier given directions with regards to Mumbai that the height of structures has to be calculated from mean sea level with special equipment. 
 
 Declining relief, the judges said the petitioner could apply to the AAI Delhi to stay the collector’s order. “We are not inclined to stay the order. Principle of greater good for greater number of people has to prevail,” said Justice Kanade.
