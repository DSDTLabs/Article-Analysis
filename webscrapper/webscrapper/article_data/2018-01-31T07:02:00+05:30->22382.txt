GHAZIABAD: Cash and jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh was robbed from a software engineer’s third-floor flat in GH7 Group housing society in   on Monday. The robbery was carried out after the engineer’s wife had locked the flat and gone downstairs to receive her daughter who had returned from school.

 Prabhat   (36), who works with a Noida-based company, lives with his wife Pragati and two children, aged two and five years in building that comprises 14 floors. “The robbery occurred between 1 and 2 pm. It looks like someone was constantly keeping an eye on her movements, while another person entered the flat after breaking its lock. When she went back inside the flat she found the door ajar and jewellery and cash worth Rs 2 lakh missing from cupboards. My credit and debit cards were also missing,” Sharda alleged. Pragati locked the house and took her younger child to a park inside the complex while waiting for her daughter. 
 
 He blamed the lax security and maintenance system for the crime. “The plugs of CCTV cameras installed near the lifts in our block were removed a day before the theft,” Sharda added.
 
 The theft inside the gated colony, which has over 2,000 flats, has raised the safety concerns of residents.
 
 Rohit Chowdhury, president of the society, said, “There are three residential societies – GH7, Arocon and Gold Coast in the same complex. Two of the three gates of the complex are manned by our security agency, while the third one, which is half constructed and near Gold Coast is managed by another.We have spoken to the builder to get the third gate completed and put a proper check on the entry of people.”
 
 He further said, “From now on, the terrace gates of all towers will be locked and the key will be kept with a guard who will only issue it after entering the name and details of the person who wants it in the register.”
 
 SHO (Vijay Nagar)   said, “An   for theft has been registered and further investigation is going on.”
