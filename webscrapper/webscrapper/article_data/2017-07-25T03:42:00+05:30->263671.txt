Soon, passengers travelling to Goa by Tejas Express will be welcomed on board by hostesses, like on flights. After deploying hostesses on the New Delhi-Agra Gatiman Express, the railways is set to introduce the service on the premier Mumbai-Goa train. A senior railway official said, "Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has asked Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to appoint hostesses on Tejas Express.” The hostesses, who will be proficient in Hindi and English, will be hired on contract. The railways said the presence of hostesses will help provide airline-like experience to travellers on Tejas Express, billed as the fastest train in India, as it can clock 200 kmph. A senior official said, “Deployment of hostesses who have undergone etiquette training will definitely enhance the travelling experience on this premium train." On Gatiman Express, hostesses welcome the passengers with rose bud and serve food at various intervals. Tejas runs five times a week but during monsoon it operates only thrice a week. The train has got all the ultra-modern amenities such as on-board infotainment, WiFi, CCTV, fire and smoke detection facilities and tea and coffee vending machine. Passengers have welcomed the move. Ghatkopar resident Rohan EL said, "I have travelled a lot by flight and can tell from experience that hostesses have patience as well as understanding in handling all types of passengers." Another passenger Shyam Pandya said, "Presence of hostesses will help prevent some unruly passengers from indulging in bad travel practices as they may not want to embarrass themselves in front of them." Railfan Akash Karnani said, "If the railways is trying to match the standards of Tejas with Gatiman and flight experience, it would be a good move to provide high-speed internet and better entertainment system along with good quality food.”
