CHARMINAR: The Hindu community of Saidabad and neighbouring areas is faced with a serious problem of not being able to find adequate space in the   to perform the last rites of the departed members of the community. The problem remains acute despite instructions from chief minister   more than a year ago that all encroachments on the Erragunta graveyard be removed. In addition to paucity of space, exorbitant charges are being levied to perform last rites which continues to be a problem for the community in area corporator   wrote to minister for   (MAUD)   apprising him of the situation. In the letter, she claimed that the fee for performing last rites is as high as Rs 20,000, which is not feasible for those from the weaker sections.
Claiming official apathy , the corporator wrote, “not even a single work was initiated and nor a single case finalized even after a lapse of two years. No officer has actively tried to follow the chief minister's instructions“.
 
 Documents obtained from the Saidabad tehsildar's office show that several portions of portion measuring around 1,800 square yards has private persons as claimants. Another 4 acres are a part of a water body over which a case is pending in the city civil court. Three other smaller portions of land measuring roughly between 200 square yards and about 600 square yards are also `disputed'. The documents show that the government does not think it `fit' to file an appeal in the case. Similarly , several other claimants have obtained status quo orders. The documents also show that while some of the portions have been taken over by the government, the demolition of existing illegal structures that came up in the graveyard is yet to be taken up.
