VARANASI: A day after his outbursts against Adityanath  , saying an elected legislator should have been Uttar Pradesh CM, BJP ally and   (SBSP) president   said on Sunday that he has a written alliance pact with BJP till 2024. 

 "I have a written agreement with Amit Shah that SBSP will stay in alliance with BJP till 2024," Rajbhar said. He, however, added he would keep raising objections against unethical practices of the state government. "By allying with BJP, we ensured victory of 100 MLAs. When I have fed the cow, then I will milk it also," he said.
 
 Resentment is brewing among BJP MPs and MLAs against the state party leadership, he said. "Not only alliance partners like me, but also BJP MPs and MLAs from Ballia, Bhadohi and Moradabad are unhappy with the state leadership. The CM has faith on only five-six IAS officers and is not ready to listen to grievances of elected representatives. Amit Shah is coming to Lucknow on April 10. I will talk to him and decide my action," he said.
 
  On Saturday, Rajbhar had said that the CM should have been elected from among the 325 elected MLAs of BJP and its alliance and alleged that the close ones of BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey and Union minister Nitin Gadkari had been inducted into education department's selection board. 
 
  "I am drawing the attention of the head of the state government towards the wrongdoings of the state machinery despite being part of the government," said Rajbhar, while admitting that the CM was not paying attention to him. "Had the CM been listening to me, I wouldn't have visited Delhi to meet BJP chief Amit Shah."
