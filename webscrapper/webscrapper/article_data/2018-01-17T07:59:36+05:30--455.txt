AHMEDABAD: While very few   (RSS) and   turned up to meet the  , the   of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Pravin Togadia, former Gujarat Congress president Arjun Modhwadia did so on Tuesday morning. State Congress in-charge Ashok Gehlot and Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki also expressed sympathy with Togadia, demanding proper security for him as he has publicly expressed fears that he may be killed in a ‘fake encounter’.

 After meeting Togadia, Modhwadia said, “I went to meet Pravinbhai to wish him a speedy recovery. I have ideological differences with him but in public life we respect our opponents. BJP considers its opponents enemies and anti-nationals. What BJP did with their leaders Haren Pandya and Sanjay Joshi is public knowledge. That a leader like Pravinbhai who is associated with the BJP and RSS has to come out in public to save his life, despite having Z+ security, is very serious matter.”
 
 Ashok Gehlot, the Gujarat Congress in-charge, said, “The case against Pravinbhai Togadia was registered while I was CM and he was arrested at that time too. But for a Z+ security proteectee having to rush for his life despite being from the ruling party and having to express fear for his life, anticipating an encounter, is a total law and order failure. The government must ensure his security.” Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel said, “The Congress need not give colour to the Pravin Togadia issue. He is working for the Hindu religion. Whatever happened to him is unfortunate. Police is investigating the case and the truth will come.”
