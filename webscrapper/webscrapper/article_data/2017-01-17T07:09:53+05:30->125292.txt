BENGALURU: Authorities at Mantri Square should be thankful that the mall wall collapsed on a Monday and that too in the early afternoon.

 The mall, one of the busiest shopping hubs catering mostly to west and north Bengaluru, usually records thousands of footfall on weekends and holidays. The visitor count had crossed 1 lakh on December 24.
 
 Within minutes of the wall collapse, the authorities decided that they had to evacuate the mall. Their task was not really enviable, as it was estimated that about 2,000 people were at the mall at the time. Evacuation was completed in less than half an hour, mall sources claimed.
 
 “I was waiting for a friend on the fourth floor. Around 2pm, we heard a loud noise and ran down to the ground floor. I tried to go to the rear of the building to see what had happened, however, we were not allowed to go. When I came back into the building, there was waterlogging in some parts. By then, people started running out of the building and I jointed them,“ said Sheshadri, a  .
 
 Those who were evacuated initially gathered outside the mall and were later escorted out. Only a handful of security guards were left inside the building to ensure that no one was left behind.
 
 Even though parts of the wall were still hanging, people and members of the media were seen milling around below. Soon senior police officers swung into action and cordoned off the area.
 
 With crowds building on   in front of the mall,   took a hit. A large number of policemen had to be deployed to ensure traffic was back to normal.
