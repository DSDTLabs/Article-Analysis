PUNE: Road experts have asserted that citizens will follow   only when they are strictly enforced and that visible police action can reduce the number of motorists driving on the wrong side of the road.

 Analysis of road behaviour and drivers’ psychology has revealed that, despite the small monetary penalty charged from rule breakers, no motorist wants to be hauled up by the police.
 
 No amount of cajoling drivers through campaigns can get more drivers to follow   rules, believes Saji Cherian, a director at  . According to him, a policeman stationed by the roadside is the best way to discourage the habit. 
 
 “Driving on the wrong side is a serious offence that puts a lot of lives at risk. Strict enforcement is the only way to instill fear among drivers. A sustained campaign can help reduce the tendency. Short drives don’t have the desired impact as citizens soon go back to breaking the rules,” he said.
 
 The traffic police must undertake a citywide, round-the-clock campaign, suggested Harshad Abhyankar, coordinator of policy advocacy at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. 
 
 “Currently, police presence is predictable and miscreants know the spots where they are likely to encounter police. To be more effective, policemen should be circulated randomly around the city through day and night,” Abhyankar said. 
 
 Traffic consultant Pratapsingh Bhonsle urged for electronic surveillance. “Drivers wouldn’t break rules if the traffic police is visible but they too can’t be present at all times. Better enforcement is possible through cameras, though they come at a cost,” he said.
