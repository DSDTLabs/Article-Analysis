Calangute: Sudesh Mayekar was on Monday declared as elected unopposed to the post of deputy sarpanch of the Calangute panchayat. Although Gabriel Fernandes from the opposition panel had also filed his nomination for the polls, it was rejected on technical grounds as he had seconded his own candidature.  Speaking to TOI, Mayekar said that as deputy sarpanch he would work more effectively to raise the standard of living of Calangute residents.  “I thank our MLA Michael Lobo for considering my candidature. Now that I've been given the responsibility, I will do my best and come out with out-of-the-box solutions,”Mayekar said. Everybody wants the basic infrastructure and we will emphasise on this. Whatever we promised in our manifesto, like a community hall, a new market complex and other facilities, we will put in place,” he said. Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said Mayekar was the consensus candidate of the ruling panel. “He will be there for one year and then another member will be made deputy sarpanch,” he said.
