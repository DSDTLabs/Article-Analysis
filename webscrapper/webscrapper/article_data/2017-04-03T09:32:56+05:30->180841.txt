BATHINDA: Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal said on Sunday that the state government had fixed a target of getting at least 12 industrial houses to set up units in state in the first year itself and achieve a figure of 60 by the time the Congress government’s tenure ends in 2022.

 During his first visit to his assembly constituency,  , after winning the February 4 state elections, Badal said the Congress government was “highly sensitive” to generating employment in the state. He reiterated the government’s “resolve” to end VIP culture.
 
 Speaking at a gathering, Badal asked the deputy commissioner not to accompany him during his visits to the city. Earlier, the entire district administration used to accompany former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, deputy CM Sukhbir Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. “The DC, SSP or officials of other departments will be called or requested to come only when there will be a need for their presence,” said Manpreet.
 
 Manpreet said the government, to begin with, was aiming to get one industrial unit per month on an average. “For this, talks are already on with (Anil) Ambani, auto giant Mitsubishi and other industrial houses. We are hoping that these talks fructify,” he said. “I am not just the finance minister, but am looking at employment generation minister too. Strengthening the industry is my foremost priority for generating employment opportunities.”
 
 He also said that the process for shifting a solid waste-management plant on Mansa Road in Bathinda had already begun.
