PUNE: Developer  , who was remanded in police custody for a week by a court in Pune on Saturday in a cheating case, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the state-run Sassoon General Hospital during the wee hours of Sunday after he fell unconscious in the the police lock up. 

 
 Kulkarni, also known as DSK, and his wife, Hemanti, were arrested from a hotel suite in Delhi and brought to Pune on Saturday evening in a case of cheating and offence under the   (MPID) Act for failing to repay deposit amounts with interest to several depositors. 
 
 Dean of Sassoon General Hospital and spine surgeon Ajay Chandanwale told TOI, "After he (DSK) fell unconscious around 12.15am on Sunday, he was rushed here. As his condition was critical, he was put on a ventilator support. A few hours later he regained consciousness. We suspect that he suffers from poor blood supply to the back side of the brain." 
 
 Kulkarni's condition, which is medically termed as   (VBI), is a temporary set of symptoms due to decreased blood flow (ischemia) in the posterior circulation of the brain. "That is the provisional diagnosis. We are running a few tests to confirm this," Chandanwale said.
