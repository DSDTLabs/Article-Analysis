BERLIN:  's chancellor said on Sunday that European border guards should be allowed to go to north   to prevent migrants from setting off across the   in rickety boats.

 
 Austria will take over the  's (EU) rotating presidency in July. Chancellor  's governing coalition took office in December after a campaign in which both partners talked tough on migration.
 
 Kurz told Sunday's edition of German newspaper   that a new mandate for EU border protection agency   should allow it ``to act in third countries, with the permission of their governments, to end smugglers' dirty business model and prevent smugglers' boats setting off on the dangerous route across the Mediterranean.''
 
 Each year, tens of thousands attempt to reach Europe in vessels that are mostly unfit for the open sea.
