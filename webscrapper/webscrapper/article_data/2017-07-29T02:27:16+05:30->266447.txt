NEW DELHI: North Sikkim is on top and Kolkata is the worst in the list of districts evaluated for child-sex ratio. While North Sikkim has moved from 831 girls per 1,000 boys in 2014 to a remarkable 1009 girls, Kolkata which boasted of a sex ratio of 1,022 girls per 1,000 boys is down to 898 girls.

 “In fact, Kolkata is unfortunately the worst of 161 districts that we have taken,” said women and child welfare minister   in the Lok Sabha on Friday, sharing details of districts selected under the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme.
 
 Gandhi’s remarks saw Mriganka Mahato, Trinamool MP from Purulia, cite the success of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s ‘kanyashree’ programme launched in 2011 and requested the Centre that the programme be taken up by other states too.
 
 To this Gandhi was quick to point that, “While the programme which the West Bengal government has launched on its own is effective, it is the only state in India which has completely refused to implement   ( ) scheme. 
 
 As a result, out of 161 districts, Kolkata is showing a severe declining trend”. Gandhi said out of the 161 districts where BBBP has been implemented, 104 districts have shown an increasing trend in sex ratio at birth.
 
 Besides North Sikkim, the districts Gandhi highlighted are Karnal where sex ratio is up from 758 to 884, Saiha in Mizoram where the trend reversed from 915 girls per 1,000 boys to 1,022 girls. “In Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu, it has gone up from 856 to 957; in Ghaziabad, it has gone up from 899 to 977; in Mansa in Punjab, it has gone up from 857 to 925; in Una in Himachal Pradesh, it has gone up from 857 to 904; in Rewari, it has gone up from 803 to 846 and in Jhansi it has gone up from 860 to 900,” Maneka said. “You can see from this that it is across the board. 
 
 It really is dependent on the enthusiasm of the state government and the ability and enthusiasm of the district head. We seem to have done well across the board,” she emphasised.
