CHENNAI: The Madras high court permanently restrained Tamil weekly magazine Kumudam Reporter from publishing articles on the private life of DMK leader and   member   without her response and consent.

 
 Justice R Subramanian passed the order on Wednesday while making it clear that the restrictions were only with reference to publication involving some matter which was exclusively private, and it did not extend to the function of   as a member of parliament or as a leader of a political party.
 
 “In the light of the law laid down by the   in the Justice K S Puttaswamy case, relating to right to privacy, I am constrained to conclude that though there cannot be a blanket injunction against the magazine, there cannot be an order in favour of the Tamil weekly enabling them to publish everything in the guise of public interest,”   said. If the magazine claims that the article is in public interest, it shall get response of the applicant and carry it along with the article, ruled the judge.
