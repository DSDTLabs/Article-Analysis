AMRITSAR: In yet another incident of   meted out to Punjabi workers at the hands of their employers in the Middle East,  , a resident of   in Gurdaspur district, has sent a distress video message to his family from Saudi Arabia alleging torture by his employer.

 “I am very upset. I haven’t eaten anything in the past five days. I feel like hanging myself. Please help me,” Rajinder said in the video message where he’s seen crying.
 
 He further alleged that the travel agent whom he had paid Rs 2 lakh had betrayed him. “He had promised me a driver’s job in a good company but here I am forced to do a labour job. I am beaten and not even given food to eat,” Rajinder said.
 
 His father Baldev Singh said he had borrowed loans to send his son abroad for family’s better future. “The agent had said that my son will get a salary of over Rs 50,000 but now his life is in danger,” he said. He appealed to the government to save his son and bring him back safely.
 
 Last year, a Saudi employer refused to pay the hospital bills of his Punjabi employee  , a resident of Gurdaspur, after he was hit by a car driven by a Saudi national and died in the hospital. His body remained in the morgue for over three months before it was sent to India following the government’s intervention.
 
 Similarly, another Punjabi youth Gurwinder Singh, a resident of Manochahal village, was put behind bars on his Saudi employer’s complaint. Gurwinder had also sent a video message seeking help release from Governorate Prison in   near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 
 Batala superintendent of police (operations) Baljit Singh said Rajinder’s father had made a complaint to police. “The application had been marked to the superintendent of police, headquarter, for an inquiry following which we will register an FIR and begin investigations,” he said.
