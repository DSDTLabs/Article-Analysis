The International Cricket Council's ( ) apprehension about obtaining tax exemptions from the Government of India for the 2021 Champions Trophy and 2023 World Cup is only half the story. The other half may have been lost in fine print or accounting work that could come back to bite the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( ) at a later stage.

 
 Mirror has learnt that the ICC, not having got the exemption from the Government of India for the  , is hoping to recover the money from the BCCI. In fact, sources say the world body is reflecting Rs 125 crore as dues from the BCCI.
 
 The figure Rs 125 crore is the amount Star has paid to the Indian government towards TDS for the 2016 championship which was a $ 290 million tournament for the ICC. But the broadcaster held back 10 per cent of that money and paid that to the Government of India towards TDS.
 
 
 
 
 As a result of that 10 per cent deduction, the ICC members' share has come down proportionately. They now insist that the tax exemption is the host board's responsibility and if it were not to come from the concerned government, it has to be the liability from that particular board.
 
 The ICC officials could not be immediately contacted on the issue but the BCCI representatives deny being asked to cough up Rs 125 crore. "We have not seen the accounts where we the dues have been reflected as BCCI's and no one has asked us about it either," said a BCCI representative who was present at the recent ICC meeting in Dubai.
 
 Besides, the BCCI officials said that they have their legal bases covered and the world body cannot ask them to clear the tax dues.
 
 BCCI CEO  , who was at the Wanderers yesterday, said that the arrangement was done much before he had taken charge of the BCCI.
 
 The 2016 World Twenty20 was allotted to India when   was the ICC chairman and it was hosted in the country when   was the president of the BCCI.
