NEW DELHI/DEORIA: Shattered and traumatized with the news of her 
  in Jammu and Kashmir's  , the daughter of Border Security Force (BSF) head constable   on Tuesday demanded '50 heads in return' of her father's life.

 "His sacrifice should not be forgotten, we want 50 heads in return for his life," said Saroj while consoling her mother, who was still coming to terms with her husband's gruesome death.
 
 "I am proud of my brother that he sacrificed his life for the nation, but is it very heart-wrenching the way he has been beheaded by the Pakistan military," said Dayashanker, the brother of Prem Sagar.
 
 
 
 
 In a 
  , two Indian soldiers were beheaded and another injured by a Pakistani 'border action team' (BAT) that sneaked into Indian territory under the cover of heavy shelling in the   sector of J&K's Poonch district on Monday.
 
 
 The provocation led the two armies to sharply escalate their exchange of fire in several areas along the 778-km  , worsening the already deep chill in India-Pakistan ties. India vowed to exact revenge for the "barbaric" mutilation of the bodies during the well-planned BAT raid and ambush conducted over 200 metres inside Indian territory, which came less than 24 hours after Pakistan army chief General   visited the LoC on Sunday.
