Shrivastava once allegedly asked his driver Rajesh Kushwaha (a daily-wage employee) to give him his ATM card so that he could help him get a loan that he needed. Kushwaha gave him his wife's card but the loan never was never sanctioned. The card, however, remained with Shrivastava. When Rajesh visited his bank once, he was told by the bank staff that every month a sum of Rs 6,000 gets transferred in the account of his wife   and was withdrawn soon.
