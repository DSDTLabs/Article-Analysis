Bhogi turned out to be yet another day of protests against   ban, many of which were thwarted by police. In at least two villages, in Madurai and Trichy districts, people were able to slip in a bull run.

 DMK protests that had police permission happened, and the party's working president   lashed out at the Centre for not ensuring jallikattu. The BJP was quick to rebut the criticism but expressed its regret for the promised ordi nance not coming through.
 
 Union environment minister Anil Madhav Dave had expressed support to jallikattu and promised action after the SC verdict was delivered. “Unfortunately the ordinance can be issued only after the Supreme Court verdict. I am still firm in my resolve to revive jallikattu,“ said Union minister  .
 
 While jallikattu should happen on Sunday, the day of Mattupongal, and proponents of jallikattu were hopeful of the ordinance coming through on Saturday, lawyers said it was unlikely . “The SC has said it cannot be pushed into delivering the verdict. The matter is sub-judice. Bringing an ordinance at this stage will clearly amount to overreach by the executive,“ said  , member of the AWBI and convenor of its legal panel.
