NAGPUR: Education officials now won’t be taken to task by their immediate bosses for spending too much time on WhatsApp, as education minister   himself wants them to use it regularly. But the catch is, the regular use is specifically for a WhatsApp group of which   is a member.

 On Tuesday, education officials from Nagpur division were informed by authorities that the minister will now communicate and clarify government policies directly with them to avoid confusion.
 
 An education official said, “A recorded video message of the minister was shown to us in which he said that many times good policies of the government are misinterpreted. There were many steps taken by the government, but the way it was presented in media, the original message is distorted.” Now, with the WhatsApp group, the minister hopes that government policies are understood in the way they are meant to be.
 
 An education official said that the group is already active and now more officials will be added.
 
 The seminar was centred around a human resources training workshop conducted by a private company.  , extension officer, said, “We were taught how the communication process works and how the message changes as it passes from one person to the other.” The government wants that schools and colleges should understand policies properly and implement them in the right spirit.
 
 The seminar had garnered media attention for non-academic reasons last week when a political party raised objection to demands of specific photo IDs for entry to venue. A letter from the local education department mentioned that all employees must bring Aadhaar card or Pan card to verify their identity. The teachers’ wing of   (MNS) protested saying that there was no need for sensitive personal information to be given for just attending an event. The local education office ultimately backed off and struck off the sentence in the new letter.
