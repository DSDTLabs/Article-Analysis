When celebs from Mumbai visit Delhi, they list usual favourites like the wide roads, street food, and even the monuments. However, for VJ and actress  , the thing that sets Delhi apart from Mumbai is the winter. Far from being turned off by the famous  , Anusha says she loves it as it gives her a chance to take out her winter clothes from her wardrobe. She tells us, "I love the Delhi winters. Those of us who live in Mumbai don’t get to take out winter clothes unless we go abroad. So I look forward to coming to Delhi because you can take out all your winter stuff and flaunt it here. In Mumbai, it just sits in your cupboard until you leave for a country with cold weather."

 Anusha says that growing up in  , she got used to winter fashion every year something that is absent in Mumbai. That is why shopping for winter clothes is the first thing she does when she visits the capital. "The first thing I do when I land here during the winters is shopping. I head to the markets from the airport – the malls in south Delhi,   – and I shop for some winter clothes. Since I grew up in Australia, I love winter fashion, but Mumbai does not give me the chance to flaunt it. That’s where Delhi comes in," she says.
