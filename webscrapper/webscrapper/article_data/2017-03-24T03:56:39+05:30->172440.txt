NEW DELHI: Two children were severely burnt after the car they were playing in caught fire at their house in Krishna Vihar of outer Delhi. Family members said the children, aged three and one, had crawled into the Swift Dzire parked inside a crammed garage. Police suspect the fire was caused by short circuit in the wires under the dashboard.

 The children, Dipanshi and Lakshita, had crawled into the car around 10am. Their father usually left the car open after parking it in the garage so that the children could play in it. Their grandmother, Sunita Devi, was watching over them.
 
 A few minutes later, Sunita noticed fumes coming out of the vehicle and alerted her husband, Hanuman Singh, who was taking a bath. By the time Singh came out, the carâ€™s cabin was engulfed in flames.
 
 After the grandparents raised an alarm, locals broke open the garage gate, pushed out the car and doused the flames. The children were rushed to a local hospital where doctors said they had suffered more than 50%  , and referred them to Safdurjung hospital.
 
 Hanuman stays with his sons, Manoj and Mohit, and the family owns a factory producing paper rolls at Paharganj. Police suspect that the children may have pulled out some wires while playing, which led to short circuit. The car was partially damaged due to the fire.
 
 Police have registered an FIR under IPC section of causing damage due to fire. The children are under observation and have not been declared out of danger.
