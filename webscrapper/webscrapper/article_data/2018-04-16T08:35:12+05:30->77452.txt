LUCKNOW: The community toilet in front of   railway station building has been demolished and railways plans to construct a small museum at the spot by August.

 The toilet in front of the imposing Charbagh railway station building was a major irritant to the passengers who complained of heavy stink in the area due to it. Scores of passengers had lodged complaints against the filthy and stinking stagnant water near the toilet which could have led to the outbreak of an epidemic.
 
 Railway officials said that after construction of the museum, some artefacts like wagon wheels of heritage engines, models of heritage engine and the old equipment of railwayâ€™s engineering will be installed with written details of their use-.Divisional railway manager (DRM) of northern railway, Lucknow division,   said that there were many complaints that the toilet was spreading stink all over the campus which troubled passengers. People avoided walking on that road because of filthy stagnant water that collected at the spot. We tried to fix the issue several times but it became a recurring problem. So, we installed three pairs of modular toilets with proper water supply and sanitation as an option for people.
 
 I decided to demolish the toilet and establish a small museum to attract passengers as the railway station building is historical and has many stories, said Kumar.
