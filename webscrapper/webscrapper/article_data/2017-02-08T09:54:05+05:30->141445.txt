HYDERABAD: Cashless transactions for environmental cause is the latest mantra by bankers now.

 The MPoS (mobile point of sale) machines used for swiping cards generate mobile receipt instead of paper receipts, thereby reducing the need for paper.
 
 “Traders can take a readily available MPoS machine, which can ensure easy cashless transactions for  ,“ Satish Dhawan, assistant general manager of   (SBH) told TOI.
 
 MPoS are best suited for ecommerce, travel services, retailers, insurance agents, cafés, hotels, hospitals and medical stores. “We don't mind taking the MPoS machines but customers expect the receipt in paper. Many don't like it when we say that we will send a mobile receipt,“ M Mohan Rao, a kirana store owner in Chikkadpally said. He is waiting for the de livery of the EPoS machine ordered last month.
 
 Sources said that many traders in Siddipet have declined offers by banks for MPoS machines. Apart from receipts generated to mobile traders, they are also scared to share their passwords with banks which is part of the process in using MPoS machines.
 
 “Many traders think that they need to be technically advanced to use this, but that is not true. It is a simple operation,“ said manager of Public Sector Bank (PSB).
 
 However, the bankers say that there is a possibility of MPoS machines being successful in urban areas as it requires internet with good speed. Ironically , the cost of the MPoS machine is much lower than the EPoS machines. They are also available in the market on rental basis.
