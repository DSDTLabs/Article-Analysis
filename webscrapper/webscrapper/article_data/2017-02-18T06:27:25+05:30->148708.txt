AHMEDABAD: When the Bhoodan and   movements began in 1951, it was considered an unparalleled human endeavour to establish a non-violent economy and help rejuvenate the Indian society. This well-intentioned land-gift movements, the   lasted till 1971 in Gujarat and the country. Records of the Sarvodaya and the SSS Rajghat, available with TOI, reveals that till July 1952, Gujarat had contributed just 2,500 acres, while three years later by the end of 1955, this figure had gone up to 39,240 acres. By the time Bhoodan ended in July 1971, almost 42.27 lakh acres of land was donated across the country , which was four times than what the then land ceiling laws were to achieve -which was 12 lakh acres.

 Many landowners had made these donations through `Daan Patra' or Bhoodan Lekh' which was a document recording the relinquish ment of all rights, title or interest of the donor in the land and offering the same to the Bhoodan committee.
 
 But at the same time there was no government document conveyancing the gift of immovable properties, which required registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act. Bhoodan land transfer was exempt from all controls involving transfer of property process.
 
 Back in the 1950s, the then Bombay State had issued circulars in connection with the  . These notifications were referred to by the revenue department in September 1980 and November 1988 claiming that the donors did not have any right over the lands.
 
 Tragically, a large portion of certificates or ' ' have either been misplaced or were destroyed after various district-level offices of the GSM closed down in each decade. Only a copy of this is available with the revenue department.
