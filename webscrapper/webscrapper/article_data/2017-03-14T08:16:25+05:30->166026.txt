HYDERABAD:  , the proprietor of the under-construction project in Kondapur struck by tragedy on Monday morning, is a popular player in Hyderabad's realty circuit. Initial investigations point towards lack of precautionary measures, taken by the builder, as a reason for the accident. 

 "It is both shocking and unfortunate. Vamsiram is a renowned group in Hyderabad with great track record. They have never in the past been associated with any act of callousness," said a senior member of CREDAI's (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India) local chapter. 
 
 In the construction business (primarily residential) for close to two decades, the company has projects across the city's upmarket pockets: Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills and Hi-Tech City. 
 
 "The group has tremendous reputation in the market. Apart from its quality of construction, the firm is also known for timely delivery of its products. Recently, they picked up large land parcels along the western corridor for both residential and commercial ventures," said a city-based realtor.
 
 Calling for developers to be careful, experts also stressed the need for strict monitoring of projects contracted out. "Unlike developers, contractors do not require any licence to operate. This needs to change to keep strict vigil on them," said a CREDAI office bearer.
