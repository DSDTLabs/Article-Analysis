HYDERABAD: In an order that could have parents up in arms again, the   has allowed private schools in Hyderabad and across   to raise school fees with a rider that hiked part of the fee should be deposited by every school in a separate bank account and not withdrawn till the matter is finally adjudicated.

 This was a fallout of the petition filed by Independent Schools Management Association, Hyderabad, that challenged the Telangana State's memo issued on January 4, 2018, banning fee hike in the coming academic year.
 
 Justice A V Sesha Sai, who on January 22 heard the arguments of the association and the state, stayed the operation of the memo and said private schools have to deposit the amount, if any, collected in excess of what is indicated in the memo, in separate accounts and the money shall not be withdrawn till further order. The judge referred to the past judgment of   in the   case which wanted a rational basis to be followed for fixing the fee structure basing on the quality of facilities and faculty rather than treating all schools alike. This judgment was later challenged by the state in  , which upheld the HC judgment.
