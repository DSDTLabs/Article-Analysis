PANAJI: Worried over losing their jobs, the   on Saturday decided to file a review petition before the   to voice their concerns after the central government said that a commercial licence was no longer required to drive taxis, three-wheelers, e-rickshaws and two-wheelers.

 The union ministry for   issued an advisory earlier this week asking state governments to do away with the earlier norm of issuing commercial transport licences. The advisory follows a Supreme Court order of July 2017.
 
 “A resolution has been taken to file a review petition. We will first write to the state government asking them to file a review petition, and if the government does not do that in 15-30 days, then we will have to file the petition,” president of the association, Virendra   said.
 
 Salgaonkar said that the move would jeopardise the careers of several drivers since anybody with a light motor vehicle would be able to drive a   or rickshaw. “Now, anybody can buy a taxi and drive it. With so many taxis on the road, there will be no business,” secretary of the association   said.
 
 The Supreme Court’s order effectively allows tourist taxis and rickshaws to be rented out. “People will give taxis for self drive. You don’t need a badge to drive the taxi,” Salgaonkar said.
 
 Instances of drivers getting a paycut have already risen to the fore, with four complaints registered with the association of taxi owners.
 
 “There will be excess supply of drivers and taxis, and if we want to continue, we will have to reduce the rate and drive,” Dessai said.
