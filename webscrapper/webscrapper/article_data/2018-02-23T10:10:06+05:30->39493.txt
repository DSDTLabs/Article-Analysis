MADURAI: A fire broke out at a   warehouse at   here on Thursday evening, but no one was injured. 

 The fire was first reported to the   fire station at 4.15pm. Sensing that it could quickly spread, an alert was sounded. Vehicles from these stations rushed to Kappalur and the city corporation too rushed its water tanker trucks to the spot. "We received the call at 4.15pm and reached the spot quickly. The water tankers provided by the city corporation was of great help," said a fire department official.
 
 Sixteen fire and rescue services personnel led by Thirumangalam station officer   managed to douse the fire after a grim battle of more than one hour. Quick action from the department saved the powerhouse and warehouse in the proximity. A preliminary investigation found that a few discarded cigarette butts could have triggered the fire. Further investigation is under way by police department, sources said. 
 
 Madurai collector   inspected the mishap site later in the evening. He said that the fire which occurred at a bus stand, spread to the warehouse premises, consuming a heap of trash material like plastic sacks, and four trees were also damaged. 
 
 There were, however, no injuries or loss of property, the collector said. He urged members of the public to keep their premises tidier considering the arid climate that could contribute to sudden fire. 
 
 He also appreciated the efforts of the fire and rescue services personnel, revenue and civil supplies workers.
