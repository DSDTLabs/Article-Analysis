KANPUR: Former Mumbai-based cricketer   and his aides Vikas Chauhan and flex installer  , arrested in a raid at Landmark hotel here during the   match between   and   on May 10, were remanded in police custody for nine hours by the court on Sunday morning. The police had sought their remand on the basis of their WhatsApp audio chat, phone call details and CCTV footages to corroborate their links with Gujarat Lions players and bookies across the country and globally. 

 "During the remand, which started at 9am on Sunday, Shah denied of having any link with two Gujarat Lions players. He confessed that as a bookie, he did all this just to create a 'hype' and to project himself as a 'boss' of all other bookies and added that he had never met or spoken on phone to two Gujarat Lions or any other IPL player," superintendent of police (east) Anurag Arya said. 
 
 Shah confessed to have links with Ajmer-based bookie Bunty Khandelwal and other bookie Hanif, who operates from South Africa.
