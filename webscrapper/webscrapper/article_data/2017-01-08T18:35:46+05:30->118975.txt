CHENNAI:   chief Minister O   on Sunday sought Prime Minister Narendra  's intervention in securing the release of all fishermen in Sri Lankan custody.
 
 The Tamil Nadu chief minister urged Modi to direct the ministry of external affairs to take expeditious steps to secure the release of 20 fishermen and 118 fishing boats, including 10 fishermen and their two mechanised fishing boats apprehended in the early hours of Sunday, without any delay. 
 
 "It is reported that, in two separate incidents, six fishermen in one mechanised fishing boat who set sail from Jegathapattinam fishing base of Pudukottai district and four fishermen in another mechanised fishing boat from Rameswaram fishing base of Ramanathapuram district were apprehended by the   in the early hours of Sunday," he said in a letter to the Prime Minister. The boats and fishermen had been reportedly taken to Kankesanthurai and Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka, he added.
  
 Panneerselvam said that even before the sense of relief following the release of the 51 fishermen could fully set in and the released fishermen reached our shores, the Sri Lankan navy had yet again resorted to its harsh and unjust tactic of apprehending Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu while peacefully pursuing their avocation in the traditional fishing waters of the Palk Bay.
  
 Though the fishermen apprehended earlier have been released, the chief minister said their boats and fishing gear were still impounded by the Sri Lankan authorities. 
 
 "The 118 boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen in Sri Lankan custody are deteriorating due to lack of maintenance on a daily basis. These boats have remained exposed to the elements over two North East Monsoon seasons and continue to suffer further damage and deterioration," Panneerselvam added.
