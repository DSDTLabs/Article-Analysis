This new year, a 14-year-old abstract artist,  , from Gurgaon has a different reason to celebrate. Like in other houses, the calendar at her place too has changed, though the difference is that this one has a page with her art on it.

 Paridhi, a Class VIII student of  , has won the   organised by the  . Talking about the painting, she says, "The theme was ‘diversity’. When people talk about diversity, they look at it from a definite perspective, like religion or nationality. But when I was told about the theme, I thought, why should I limit it to just one perspective? So in my painting, I tried to bring in different elements."
 
 
 
  
  The calendar with her painting 
 
 
 Her painting is among the top twelve designs that were selected from entries received from all over the country. Paridhi, who is the youngest contestant to win this annual competition, tells us, "I didn’t know that it’s after a gap of three years that a painting by a Gurgaon student has been selected to be a part of this calendar. When my teachers told me about it I was really happy. It was a proud moment for them."
 
 Paridhi says that the announcement of the art competition and her exams clashed, and she was doing it to get a break from her regular studies as well. But after two-three days of work, it was not very difficult for her to focus on both. She adds, "My Art teacher has taught me how to use the elements in the painting. I used bright acrylic colours. I paint what comes to my mind. While sometimes I understand the meaning of my paintings, the other times I leave it for the grown-ups to see it and decode."
