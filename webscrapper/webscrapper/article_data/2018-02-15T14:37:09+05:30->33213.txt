Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar   on Wednesday said that the state has the capacity to accommodate around 15 million tourists. He said that this can be achieved by enhancing infrastructural facilities and ensuring that tourists are evenly spread across the state, rather than having them concentrated in certain areas. 

 Parrikar was replying to a query if the rise in domestic tourism is putting a strain on the state’s infrastructure, in the context of a recent video clip showing a man urinating from a bus while parked at  .
 
 He said that the pressure is felt only because the carrying capacity of infrastructure is 50-60 lakh. 
 
 “However, if we improve infrastructure through the new Zuari and   bridges, creating more garbage treatment facilities, adding more hotels, etc, we can easily accommodate ten million tourists,” the chief minister said.
 
 The enhancement of capacity will be addressed within the next two years, Parrikar said. But after that, if we want address future growth, we will have to ensure that the tourists are spread across a wider area, he added.
 
 “In the next two years, Goa’s tourist footfalls will cross the ten million mark. So, we will have to spread them across the state,” said Parrikar, while pointing out that Goa shouldn’t depend on tourism and mining industries alone.
 
 The chief minister also said that a few years ago, the government adopted a strategy which led to tourists arriving during all seasons in the state, including the monsoon, unlike earlier which was only restricted between the peak season of October-May.
