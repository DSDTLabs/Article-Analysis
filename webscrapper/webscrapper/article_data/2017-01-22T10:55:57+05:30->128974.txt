KOLKATA: Autohaus, a Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturing company, is investing over Rs 1300 crore in West Bengal to manufacture e-rickshaws, a mode of transport that is fast becoming popular in the suburbs and hinterland of the state, executive director Zhu Zhen Lin announced on the sidelines of the Bengal   Summit on Saturday.

 The Chinese company has already set up the plant alongside   and the production of e-rickshaws is underway. “We are waiting for a few clearances after which we will start rolling out the e-rickshaws. Our dealers’ network is in place,” said Lin. 
 
 E-rickshaws or totos have mushroomed in suburban and rural Bengal in the past four years and become the most economical and reliable mode of transport in the interiors where the roads are undulated and last mile connectivity is almost absent.
 
 The totos are currently imported from China and assembled here before selling them which spikes up the price. “We will be manufacturing the vehicles in Bengal and maximum spare parts will be sourced locally,” said Lin.
 
 The spare parts of the vehicles will be available with the dealer which will ensure that the owners do not have to run from pillar to post. The dealers will also provide any servicing that needs to be done including on-call service. 
 
 The e-rickshaws will also be sold in Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and north-eastern states.
