INDORE: On  , a large number of people including children participated in a run to spread   on Sunday.

 Divisional commissioner Sanjay Dubey, collector P Narahari and in-charge DIG Rakesh Gupta participated in the event and distributed prizes to the winners. Nonit Lohadiya was bestowed the first prize.
 
 “Autism is more common among children and it affects brain development the most. Early detection can help in treating it to a great extent,” Dubey said.
 
 He added that regular health checkups of those suffering from   are a must as any negligence can lead to multiple disabilities.
 
 “A national level study has proved that if provided proper education and empowered, those suffering from autism can lead a respectable life in the society. Therefore, public awareness is the key,” Dubey said.
 
 While addressing a workshop at Abhay Prashal, Dr Neena Vaidhya taught parents of autistic children the strategies, approaches and techniques as well as using visuals, cards and pictures to make them understand and learn things. She emphasised on inculcating yoga for further improvement.
 
 People with autism find it difficult or are slow to communicate and interact with others. Other problems include the inability to learn languages fast, little or no eye contact and mental health issues.
 
 Experts say there are around 1 crore people, including a large number children, suffering from autism across the country. But with the right sort of support, one can be helped to live a more fulfilling life.
 
 They added that the exact cause of autism is yet to be investigated but research says factors, including genetic and environmental ones, may account for differences in development.
