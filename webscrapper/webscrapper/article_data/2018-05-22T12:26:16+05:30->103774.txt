CHANDIGARH: Traffic jams in the residential and commercial areas of   have become so severe that local residents often don’t get any   near their own houses and market.

 Every festival season, the civic authorities concerned allow visitors to park their vehicles in nearby schools. It eases the rush in the market’s parking lots, but residents want this practice carried on for the entire year, so that commuters get used to it. “Why enforce this rule for only the festivals?” a resident said.
 
 Sharing their problems with TOI, local residents said this traffic chaos had disrupted their daily routine. The number of four-wheelers has multiplied in the city and the civic authorities have not made any parking arrangements for the added set of cars and two-wheelers. Traffic gets blocked on the narrow, inner streets, while paver blocks have made the roadsides so high that it is now difficult to park there.
 
 Sector-22 government houses resident welfare society president Vinod Vashisht raised the issue with the civic authorities and demanded that the owner of any vehicle parked on the roadside be penalised. Still, the illegal street vendors continue to occupy the road berms. Another resident said: “The MC should make parking arrangements in the residential area by using the free space around parks. The number of vehicles in the sector has increased, while the parking space has reduced.
 
 Area councillor Ravi Kant Sharma said: “I will discuss the issue with the Sector-22 residents and find out a way of creating parking space and dealing with the traffic chaos.”
