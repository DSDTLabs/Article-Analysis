PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said the state government was committed to eradicating   like dowry and child marriage, apart from taking steps to increase the income of farmers by implementing its ambitious agriculture road map.

 “These three measures along with complete prohibition in the state are concrete ways to achieve tangible social change and economic growth in present-day Bihar,” the CM said while addressing a symposium on ‘Gandhi ki raah, desh ki jaroorat’ at a hotel here. He added the government will take steps to revive Buniyadi schools opened in East Champaran and   districts in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.
 
 Mahatma Gandhi’s great-grandson and writer   was among the other prominent speakers at the event.
 
 The CM said he will succeed in his campaign against liquor consumption, dowry and child marriage, as even Swami Vivekananda had stated that any campaign for social change is first derided upon, then protested against and finally accepted by all.
 
 The CM said the primary objective of the centenary celebrations of Gandhi’s Champaran satyagrah is to take his teachings to the younger generation, including schoolchildren.
 
 A booklet containing 50 stories on father of the nation will be sent to schools. Films on Mahatma’s life are also being screened in every village.
 
 The CM said Bapu had asked people to use technology for their own good and not to be its prisoners. He added steps have been taken to empower women by giving them reservation in panchayats, urban local bodies and government jobs and promoting the admission of girl students in schools.
