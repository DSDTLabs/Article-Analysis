MANIMAJRA: The town gates that held back the invading army of rape convict Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh’s followers on August 25 had been repaired only that morning. The solo effort of the resident welfare association (RWA) saved the 8,000-odd houses and 11,000 population of Modern Housing Complex.

 Tired of waiting for the   of Chandigarh to provide the residential complexes with basic   amenities, many resident welfare associations (RWAs) of   have made own arrangements by collecting monthly maintenance charges from households. Reinforcing the security gates with this money has helped reduce petty theft and vehicle lifting. The RWAs have hired guards to check all the vehicles that enter or exit the complexes. Native vehicles carry the RWA sticker. Five repaired iron gates, manned by two night guards each, protect Modern Housing Complex.
 
 The need to repair the iron gates is stronger since August 25, when   supporters went on arson and rioting in the neighborhood. “I received calls from people that the rampaging mob was headed to Modern Housing Complex,” RWA president colonel   (retd) said: “We had been writing to the MC since July that our gates that didn’t shut properly could jeopardise security. The gates’ rollers were stuck in the grooves of re-carpeted road. We were lucky to finish repairing gate 5 on the morning of August 25, and if we had not, we fear to imagine the consequences.”
 
 Ever quarter, the RWA collects Rs 16.50 from each house, which amounts to Rs 25,000. The security guards have orders to man the two main gates all night. “Chain snatching, vehicle lifting, and other petty crimes have reduced greatly,” the RWA president said. “The MC is least bothered about these issues. They never respond.”
