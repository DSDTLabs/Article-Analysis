Pune: A con man, posing as an employee of a public sector bank over phone, allegedly collected debit card details of a 54-year-old medical practitioner and siphoned Rs 65,900 from her account using e-wallets.

 The   came to light on Wednesday when the victim, a resident of Mayur Colony in Kothrud, lodged a complaint with the Kothrud police. The crime was committed on January 4, senior inspector Raghunath Phuge said.
 
 The woman runs a clinic on Paud Road. On January 4, when she was at her clinic, she received a call from the suspect claimed to be an employee of a public sector bank, where she had an account.
 
 Phuge said the suspect told her that a decision has been taken to cancel all the debit cards as per a new government scheme. “He said the bank will renew her debit card and send it to her immediately,” Phuge said.
 
 The person then requested the woman to share her card number and CVV (card verification value) printed on the card. “She gave him the details as the caller told her that it was a routine process. She also gave him eight one time passwords that she received on her phone,” Phuge said.
 
 She was informed of the fraud an hour later by an officer of the bank where she had her account.
