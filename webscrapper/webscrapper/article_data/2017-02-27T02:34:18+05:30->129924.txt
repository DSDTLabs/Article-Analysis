Jackie Chan, who is sharing screen space with Sonu Sood in the Indo-Chinese production 'Kung Fu Yoga', arrived in India on Monday morning. The celebrated actor received a grand welcome at the Mumbai International airport. The reception at the airport gave him a taste of Indian culture as   was greeted with a garland and tilak. 

 
  
 Understandably, the actor was thronged by thousands of fans who were waiting to catch a glimpse of him. The 62-year-old mega star waved out to the crowd and even did Namaste for the shutterbugs and his fans. Not just that, Chan even struck the Kung Fu pose with his co-star Sonu as the shutterbugs went into a frenzy. 
 
 
  Jackie Chan is here to promote his action-adventure comedy, which also stars Disha Patani and Amyra Dastur in key roles. He will reportedly stay at a suburban five-star hotel, where a choreographed dance number and an extensive Indian menu have been planned for the mega star.
