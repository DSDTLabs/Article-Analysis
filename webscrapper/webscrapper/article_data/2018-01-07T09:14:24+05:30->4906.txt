LUCKNOW: On the backfoot for colouring the boundary wall of its office premises in saffron, the   got the structure repainted in white on Saturday. The   also claimed taking action against the contractor who painted the wall.

 Committee secretary   said the contractor roped in for the purpose has been asked to give an explanation.
 
 “Rang thoda zyada gadhha ho gaya (the colour was a bit too deep),” Singh said in a statement.
 
 On Friday, Singh had told TOI that though the idea was to get the building painted in accordance with other government buildings, the contractor appeared to have been over zealous in colouring the wall saffron. 
 
 The incident has evoked sharp responses from BJP’s detractors who claimed that the move was like imposing its ideology on people.   minister   was even candid in saying that saffron depicted ‘ujala’ (bright) and that colouring the wall saffron would prevent it from getting dirty.
