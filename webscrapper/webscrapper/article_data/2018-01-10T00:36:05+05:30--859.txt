Coimbatore: More than 550 Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Tnstc) employees, along with their family members, staged a protest in front of the corporation headquarters on Mettupalayam Road on Tuesday. They demanded the government to hike their salary and fulfil other demands. “Though we demanded 2.57% salary hike, the government is not ready. We want a minimum salary of Rs 19,500 for non-technical staff and pension for all those who joined work after April 2003. Tnstc authorities should deposit the deducted amount from our salaries to LIC and EPF. The state government also failed to return Rs 7,000 crore deducted from the staff,” said All India Trade Union Congress (Aituc) state federation president KM Selvaraj. Vanitha Chakkaravarthy from Othakkalmandapam. whose husband Duraisamy is a Tnstc staff, said that while private bus operators are earning profit, Tnstc is suffering loss. “The administration should be changed to make the corporation profitable. The state government should come forward to solve the employees’ strike,” she said. A Pushparani from Mettupalayam, widow of A Arumugam, who was a store keeper, said she gets the pension very late. “I get Rs 7,000 as pension from the government. But, the amount is credited to my bank account mostly on the 10th,” she said. The protesters said they will conduct a protest in front of labour department offices across Tamil Nadu on Wednesday to condemn the department.
