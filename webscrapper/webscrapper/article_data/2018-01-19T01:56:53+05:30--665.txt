CHENNAI: By talking about the need to create a south-centric political combine, under the  , actor   may be trying to recreate the  , when DMK, TDP and JD(U), besides communists from Kerala, together represented southern interests. 

 
 As with the case of the 1988 formation that kick-started from Chennai and went on to capture power at the Centre in 1989, Kamal too may have his eye on a similar political  .
 
 For that matter, even former Congress president Sonia Gandhi began her strategic comeback from the South in 2004, by first tying up with DMK as part of UPA. But can Kamal, known across the region only through films so far, replicate what political stalwarts could deliver?
 
 "This is not something new that Kamal has mooted. DMK founder C N Annadurai had, in 1966, after abandoning the separate Tamil state theory, voiced the need to form a close knit conglomeration of the southern Dravidian states to fight for the region's rights with the Centre. But that was never taken forward in right earnest, other than meetings of four southern state chief ministers for sh aring river waters," Dravidian scholar K Thirunavukkarasu told TOI. 
 
 Further, he feels what Kamal has put forward cannot even be equated to a political move on the lines of the National Front. "What Stalin (DMK working president) did in YMCA by bringing together regional party leaders from across India can be termed one such initiative. But, Stalin has not yet taken that forward. But, what Kamal is proposing needs lot more courage to implement," Thirunavukkarasu observed.
