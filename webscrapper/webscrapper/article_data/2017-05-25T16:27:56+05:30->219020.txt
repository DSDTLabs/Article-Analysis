Currently, he's the batting coach of the team," said an official. "It remains to be seen if the BCCI accedes to Kumble's request, because an assistant coach's salary is Rs 4 crores," he added.
 
 The India coach has asked for a permanent, professional manager to accompany the team at all times. "Currently, the Board deputes any of its state association officials for the job. Kumble wants a professional administrator to be the permanent manager of the team," said a source.
