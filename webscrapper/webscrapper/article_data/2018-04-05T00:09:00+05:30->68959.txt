Pune: As the deadline to dump plastic in the state nears, hotel and restaurant owners are busy calculating losses they would incur while clearing the unusable cutlery and other items.  A rough estimate by the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) revealed that over Rs 4-5 crore worth of plastic items are lying in their inventory, most of which would go waste, in the state.  The hoteliers have urged the government to grant them a transition time of 60-90 days to dispose of the items. HRAWI president Dilip Datwani said, “We are not against the move to ban plastic and welcome the government’s decision. But a ban with immediate effect has its consequences, which we are not in a position to deal with at this moment.”  Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association president Ganesh Shetty said that each establishment has on an average plastic items, including bags and cutlery, worth Rs 20,000-Rs 25,000. “This should calculate to a cost of Rs 35 lakh to Rs 50 lakh of just plastic ware and bags in the inventory. We have sought some more time so that we can use this inventory and not go into losses,” he said. Vikram Shetty, vice-president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said, “Plastic items such as carry bags, containers, plates and forks worth Rs 15,000 are lying at my restaurant. We would lose out on parcel orders as there is a shortage of substitutes, such as those made of corn starch.”
