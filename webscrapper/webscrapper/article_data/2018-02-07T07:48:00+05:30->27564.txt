Ludhiana: The police on Tuesday arrested a railway lineman for raping his 15-year-old neighbour on the pretext of marriage. 

 In her police complaint, the schoolgirl said, “The 24-year-old used to stalk me on way to school. Later, he befriended me. In April 2016, he took me to his railway quarter and raped me on the promise of marriage. This continued for a year. In May 2017, he took me to Delhi. After violating me there, he refused to marry me and abandoned me at the railway station.” 
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector Jaswinder Singh said, “After the girl reached home, she did not contact him. The girl lodged a complaint after she came to know that the accused had got married in March 2017.” 
 
 A case under Section 376 (rape) and the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has been registered.
