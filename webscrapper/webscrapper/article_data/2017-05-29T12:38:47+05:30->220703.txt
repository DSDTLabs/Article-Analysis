 The slice-of-life comedy is the story of thousands of Indian parents, who aspire to enrol their children in an English medium school. It not only explores the Hindi-versus-English divide but also conveys the message to eradicate the tendency to pit one against the other.
 
 Irrfan Khan has won appreciation for his brilliant performance in the comedy. ‘Hindi Medium’ also gained momentum through good word of mouth post its release.
