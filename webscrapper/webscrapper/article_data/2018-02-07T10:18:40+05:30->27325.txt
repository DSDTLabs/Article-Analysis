NAGPUR: A 30-year-old man,  , working as a cab driver, was duped by one Jai   of Rs21,000. Apart from cheating him of the cash, Salame also drove away a new car purchased in January by the victim.

 Police said Salame had befriended Dhanvijay while riding his cab, which he had hired from LIC Square. Having impressed him with his smooth talk, Salame convinced Dhanvijay to pay him some money to get him a government job at the collector office. Salame claimed to be a resident of Manish Nagar. Police said Dhanvijay had no clue about Salameâ€™s whereabouts apart from a cell phone number.
 
 After Dhanvijay made some payments, Salame brought him a fake appointment letter, stating that he has got a government job. Later, Salame asked Dhanvijay to buy a new car since a senior official of the collector office wanted to appoint him as his driver. He took the newly purchased car on the pretext of showing it to the official, and never returned.
 
 When Dhanvijay tried to call him on his cell phone, he was not reachable. After realizing he had been cheated, Dhanvijay approached   police station, where an offence of cheating and forgery has been registered against Salame.
