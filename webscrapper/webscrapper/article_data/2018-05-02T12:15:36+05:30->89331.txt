 After three hours airline staff managed to solve the issue .   of   said that delays of more than two hours would have an impact on the travel schedule of passengers. "If the delay is more, people may have to reschedule their hotel bookings, tour bookings. Passengers will lose out on their travel plans. They may not be able to stay an extra day because flights will be full and tickets will be expensive."
