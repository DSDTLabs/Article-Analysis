Filmmaker   is reportedly in talks to direct a live-action Nightwing movie. 

 The Accountant's Bill Dubuque is currently writing the script for the movie, which will be based on the   character Dick Grayson. 
 
 In the comic books, Grayson is known as the first Robin, Batman's sidekick, who was taken in by the Caped Crusader after his parents were murdered. The character retires as Robin and assumes the superhero persona Nightwing. 
 
  
  
 Grayson is currently voiced by   in Mckay's 'The Lego Batman Movie.' 
 
 If the filmmaker signs on to helm a standalone Nightwing, it will be his live-action feature film debut. 
 
 Several actors including Douglas Croft,  ,  , and Chris O'Donnell have previously played Robin onscreen, and in The Dark Knight Rises, it is revealed  's character's real name is Robin. 
 
 It was previously thought the actor would reprise his role or take over as Batman, but he explained it is unlikely he will be returning to the Caped Crusader's universe.
