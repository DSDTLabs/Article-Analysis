Ludhiana: Residents will have to wait for the election of new councillors and mayor for development of their wards as local bodies minister Navjot Singh   on Tuesday clarified that the government would release funds only after the MC polls.

 Sidhu was in the city to take part in a two-day international conference at   on Tuesday.
 
 He said the Ludhiana MC elections would be held anytime between February 3 and 20.
 
 Addressing the media persons over the issue of development, Sidhu said the government did not release funds earlier as SAD-BJP councillors who ruled the MC would have misused the funds. “Now when   has won civic polls in Jalandhar, Amritsar and  , development works have started at a fast pace,” he added.
 
 He said they will release the grants for the development works once the new house is formed in Ludhiana. “Unlike SAD-BJP leaders, the new elected representatives would utilize the funds judiciously,” he added.
 
 Regarding MC polls, Sidhu claimed that like Congress will win civic poll as it did in other cities.
 
 Indicating that the MLAs would be playing an important role in the distribution of tickets, he mentioned that the city’s MLAs would be consulted during the selection of candidates. “As one MLA represents more than 2 lakh voters, therefore their advice cannot be ignored,” he said.
 
 Sidhu also claimed that the state government would welcome NRIs with open arms and it would leave no stone unturned to solve their issues promptly. In an appeal to around 2 crore NRI Punjabis living abroad, the minister said the state government would ensure that they get a non-corrupt and pro-industry atmosphere in   with a dedicated single-window system to facilitate them.
