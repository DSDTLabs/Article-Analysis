NEW DELHI: The 2017-18  , tabled in the assembly on Wednesday, generated mixed response with several Delhiites applauding the “pro-people” initiatives while many doubting several promises. 

 Many people praised the government for its focus on social welfare, including the decision to reduce taxes on sanitary napkins. It is a “moving gesture by the government,” said Ahtin Pal, a business consultant.
 
 Pal, however, is unhappy with the measures to fight pollution. “There should be stricter laws to reduce pollution and stop farmers who burn their crops.”
 
 While praising the budget’s stress on health and education sectors, many also questioned the viability of several promises. “Most of the steps seems to be an attempt to brush away last year’s misses. In both sectors, there is widespread corruption,” said Swadeep Shukla, a development officer at LIC.
 
 The decision to increase the number of beds in government hospitals, however, has made him happy. It “would help those who cannot afford healthcare in private facilities”, he said. But Shweta Gupta, a housewife who lives in Khauz Khas, said, “The move will create trouble if the hospitals don’t get more doctors and nurses.” 
 
 Manish Purohit, who broke his leg in a road accident five years ago, lauded the “innovative idea of rewarding people who help accident victims. Till the police came, nobody came forward to help me after my accident.” The government will pay Rs 2,000 to everybody who will help accident victims. 
 
 The decision to introduce more public buses has made daily commuters happy. “The rush in the Metro is growing every day,” said Neha Panwar, a lawyer.
 
 On the decision to hike salaries of government employees, a management consultant, Sachin Parasar, said he was not against it but “there should be more accountability among them. But salary hike is sure to win votes, seeking accountability won’t”.
