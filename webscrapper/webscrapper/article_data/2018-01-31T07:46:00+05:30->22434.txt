Badoh (Nagrota): Chief minister Jairam Thakur mocked the Congress during a massive rally in Nagrota Bagwan constituency, a Congress stronghold since 1998, saying that the party, which did little during its five-year tenure, is expecting massive development within a month of BJP forming the government.

 The first and foremost development that has happened is routing of the Congress in the hill state, the CM added.
 
 Thakur was on his third day of winter sojourn to Kangra district on Tuesday.
 
 He said Congress leaders are issuing such statements out of frustration.
 
 On the issue of “tired and retired officers”, the CM said, “My government took a decision to send home the tired and retired. There were more than 32,000 retired and extension seekers during the Congress government.”
 
 The CM said his government has not given extension to anyone.
 
 He said detailed project reports (DPRs) of 69 national highways were pending for over one-and-a-half years in the Congress regime. “But we have directed officials to complete the process of tenders for DPR preparation by March 31,” said the Chief Minister.
 
 He said Himachal Pradesh had been selected under second phase of Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN), a regional connectivity scheme. The visitors will now be able to avail air services at mere Rs 2,500 to Rs 2,800 from Chandigarh to Shimla, Kangra and other places as well, he said.
 
 “It was during the Congress regime that infamous rape and murder case took place at Kotkhai and a witness was also murdered in the police custody,” said the CM.
 
 “The BJP government has launched ‘Guddiya helpline’ 1515 and we will ensure that the action is taken within 48 hours of crime,” he said.
 
 The government has shifted headquarters of Rs 700crore IDP project from Solan to Dharamshala, the CM said.
