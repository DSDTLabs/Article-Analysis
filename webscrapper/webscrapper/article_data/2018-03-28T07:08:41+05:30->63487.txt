LUCKNOW: The workers of Eco-Green, company handling   in the city, are on   for over a week now; and as a result, various roads and colonies are littered with  . The company has been working for a year now but has not sorted out its logistical issues due to which the localities where it is working turn into a mess. 

 This week, Eco-Green workers again went on a strike against the targets set for them.
 
 The project head of Eco-Green, Abhishek Singh said, "Earlier, workers were demanding Rs 6,000 per month, irrespective of the number of houses, they collected garbage from. That is why many households were left out from garbage collection network. Now, we offered Rs 20 per house which means they need to cover 300 houses to earn Rs 6,000. They went on strike as we tried to break their monopoly. That is why garbage is not being picked from houses and roads."
 
 Singh said that they are trying to negotiate with workers and many have resumed work. "Around 60% workers are back on duty and the rest will soon follow. The target-based work will improve garbage collection results," he said. 
 
 Because of the ongoing strike, huge heaps of garbage are   with stray animals and insects hovering over them. The strike has hampered lifting of garbage from collection points as well as door-to-door collection.
