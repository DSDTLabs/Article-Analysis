AHMEDABAD: Gujarat   (HC) has upheld two-year imprisonment as punishment for a convict for   and absconding for over two years.

  Refusing to show leniency in such cases, Justice Z K Saiyed observed that due to jumping of bail and parole, convicts are not available during final hearings for appeals in criminal matters. “The courts have been issuing bailable and non-bailable warrants. Even special squads nominated by the   in districts are making efforts to find out and search for the absconding persons but the number of pending criminal appeals is increasing because of the convict jumping parole and absconding from the law,” the court observed.
 
 When the prisoner said that the punishment was harsh, the HC said, “In such cases, no leniency can be awarded to the prisoner.”
 
 In this case, a convict from Junagadh, Bhagwanji Kodiyatar, lodged in the  , was released on 15-day parole and was supposed to surrender by February 15, 2004. But he did not surrender and was finally re-arrested after two years and six months. A magisterial court in Junagadh punished him with two-year jail term after the jail authorities filed a complaint in this connection.
 
 A sessions court in Junagadh confirmed the conviction on December 23, 2016. The issue came to the HC, where the prisoner’s advocate argued that his client could not surrender in time because of financial difficulties being faced by his family.
 
 The state government supported the order of conviction and highlighted an order passed by the HC’s division bench with regard to jumping of bail and parole. Following this order, the state home department had appointed special squads for parole and bail jumpers at every district, which is still in force.
