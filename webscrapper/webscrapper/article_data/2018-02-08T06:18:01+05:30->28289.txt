Panaji: Four activists from Goa’s mining belt, reacting to the Supreme Court judgement, said that the order was a slap on the faces of all those who provided the high court of Bombay at Goa misinformation to grant the second renewal of leases to mining companies. 

 Rama Ladu Velip of Colamb, Tulshidas Shaba Velip of Cavrem, Abhijit Prabhudesai of Curtorim and Dinanath Gaonkar of Shirgao were representing the mining affected villages of Bicholim, Quepem and Sanguem taluka through a special leave petition before the Supreme Court.
 
 “We are estatic about the judgement. But the fight is not over yet. The government should now focus on recovering the Rs 35,000 crore losses caused by the mining companies to the state exchequer. This money, if reinvested, is more than sufficient to support the families dependent on mining for their livelihood. At the same time, the government should invest this money in improving the socio-economic conditions in the mining-affected villages where agriculture, water sources, land and environment has long been affected by rampant illegal mining,” said Prabhudesai.
 
  “In the interest of the next generation of Goans, the government should stop all mining activities for the next 10 years at least, as we have little ore left,” said Ravindra Velip of Cavrem.
