SHAHJAHANPUR: A 36-year-old man was killed in a tiger attack inside the   forest range of   forest division on Wednesday night. The man was missing since the evening after he went inside the forest searching for his lost buffalo. 

  On Thursday morning, his half-eaten body was recovered near   river. 
 
 The forest department while confirming the presence of three to four tigers in this area said they had warned villagers to stay away from the forest area. People in the area under   beat in Mohammdi forest range had also reported seeing tigers outside the village.
