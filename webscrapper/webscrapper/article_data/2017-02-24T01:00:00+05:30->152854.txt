 Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt’s 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania' had memorable songs like 'Saturday Saturday', 'Lucky Tu Lucky Me', 'Samjhawan' and 'Emotional Fool'. And now, the team is back with 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania', a sequel of sorts. We must say, the soundtrack of this new venture is quite interesting and non-conforming as well. The album kick-starts with a track that suffers from the 90s hangover — 'Aashiq Surrender Hua'. Composer-singer Amaal Mallik and Shreya Ghoshal are in their element in the track, which is perky, catchy and foot-tapping. The beats are on an upswing and the lyrics by  , crazy. Next in line is 'Roke Na Ruke Naina', a beautiful number that reflects on how it is to miss that special someone. The way Arijit Singh (take a bow, please!) brings Kumaar’s lyrics to life is striking, and the fusion of several traditional Indian instruments only accentuates the appeal. This is definitely the pick of the album for us. ' ' is a love ballad that has been penned and sung by Akhil Sachdeva. What works in its advantage is that the vocals have taken centre stage, with the instruments acting as just the mount. The title track 'Badri Ki Dulhania' lifts the mood of the album with its perky beats. Composed by Tanishk Bagchi, the song has been rendered by a host of singers — Dev Negi, Neha Kakkar, Monali Thakur, Ikka Singh and Rajnigandha Shekhawat. The hook line is catchy and this one will surely find a place in weddings. The album ends with a bang with 'Tamma Tamma Again', a recreated version of the ever popular 90s number (composed by Indeevar).   has retained the original song — in the voice of   and Anuradha Paudwal — and just added a little bit of rap and comments (by Ameen Sayani) in between to perk it up. On the whole, the album is an interesting mélange of songs that pander to different ‘music tastebuds’.
