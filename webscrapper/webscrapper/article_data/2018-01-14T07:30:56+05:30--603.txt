CHENNAI:   may soon boost supply to residents as Andhra Pradesh has opened its reservoirs to release 3.33 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water from the Krishna river to Chennai.

 The last time metro water increased supply was after rains in November 2017. The civic body increased the supply to 650MLD from 470MLD, after the city’s reservoirs were recharged following a week’s rainfall.
 
 The Andhra Pradesh government, on Friday, signed the papers to release 3.33tmcft water from Kandaleru reservoir to   reservoir – one of the prime drinking water sources for Chennai. “Now, we will decide on increasing daily supply once the reservoir levels stabilise,” said a Metrowater spokesperson.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 On Saturday, the reservoir had less than 35% of its storage capacity, with water levels touching 1,108mcft.
 
 Itwas recording an inflow of 276cusecs and outflow of 26cusecs. Although thewater levels in almost all the reservoirs was better compared to January 2017, the current capacity in Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and   stands at 43% of its total capacity.
 
 In December, public works department chief engineer ( ) Murugu Subramanian, had written to the Andhra Pradesh government stating the storage levels in the four reservoirs supplying water to Chennai was only less than half its capacity, as the rainfall was less than average in the catchment areas during monsoon.
 
 Following this, a team of officials including PWD secretary S K Prabhakar met senior officials in Andhra Pradesh. The team stressed that as per an interstate agreement, Andhra Pradesh has to supply 12tmcft every year to Tamil Nadu.
 
 In 2017, only 3tmcft was supplied, while in 2016, only 1tmcft was supplied.
 
 “We presented the city’s case to them. They had agreed to release water and it has been released now. We will have to wait and see how much we receive,” Murugi Subramanian said.
