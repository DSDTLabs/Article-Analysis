Patiala: Akali MLA from Sanour, Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra, on Tuesday alleged that many developmental projects were suddenly stalled by the Congress government across Punjab. He accused the incumbent party of imposing “financial emergency” on the state.

 Harinderpal, the only SAD candidate to have won a seat in Patiala district, said the government should have taken a balanced approach while calling off all the developmental projects. “The government could have sought expert advice on the issue and projects half-finished should have been allowed to be completed. Roads, drainage and other projects have been left midway creating more problems for the people than helping the government consolidate its financial standing,” he claimed.
 
 He also questioned removal of red beacons from the ministers’ vehicles, claiming that it was just a gimmick in the name of ending VIP culture as the chief minister went on to appoint several officers on special duty (OSDs) one after the other.
 
 “If the CM was committed to ending the VIP culture, he should have gathered a team of experts to help him run the state affairs, but he had got an army of OSDs. They are only adding to the financial liability of the government,” Harinderpal said.
