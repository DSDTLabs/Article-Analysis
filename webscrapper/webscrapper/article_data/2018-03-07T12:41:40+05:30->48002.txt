NEW DELHI: In a bizarre punishment, a   ( ) jawan who forgot to affix 'honourable' or 'Shri' while referring to   Narendra Modi has been penalised by the force, which called the mistake "disrespect" to the Prime Minister. The constable was handed down a seven-day pay cut.

 The incident took place on February 21 inside the BSF's 15th Battalion headquarters in Mahatpur, Nadia (West Bengal), during the zero parade, a routine exercise to account for jawans' daily activities.
 
 During the parade, constable Sanjeev Kumar used the word "Modi programme" while giving a report.
 
 The commanding officer of the battalion, Commandant Anup Lal Bhagat, decided to initiate disciplinary action against Kumar. He was tried summarily and found "guilty" under Section 40 of the BSF Act (prejudicial to good order and discipline of the force).
 
 TOI spoke to senior officers in the BSF and other forces, who called the punishment a "bit harsh" and "uncalled for".
 
 BSF director general K K Sharma was unavailable for comment.
