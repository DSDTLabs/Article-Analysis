Nagpur: After a long wait the urban development department (UDD) has finally notified the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA). Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) will henceforth be known as   in the metro region. Its role inside city limits is set to end by December 2017. The metro region is spread over 3,567 sq km and covers 719 villages. 

 UDD has also created the post of metropolitan commissioner to head the NMRDA. NIT chairman Dr Dipak Mhaisekar has been asked to take the additional charge of this post.
 
 In addition to the metropolitan commissioner, several other posts will be created for NMRDA. NIT employees ready to work for the new agency will be appointed on these posts. 
 
 The government on December 23, 2014, had notified NIT as the area development authority of Nagpur metro region. Till now, NIT acted in lieu of NMRDA. So far the development of the metro region has not started in full swing. NIT promises to do it from next financial year.
 
 The development of metro region requires about Rs40,000 crore and some Rs10,000 crore is required for the first phase. NMRDA faces a monumental task in raising this amount. It also faces the challenge of convincing the land owners to go in for land pooling.
