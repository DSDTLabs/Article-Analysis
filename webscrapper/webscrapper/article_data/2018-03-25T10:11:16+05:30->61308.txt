LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav’s thank you note for Pratapgarh’s   Raghuraj Pratap alias   on the party’s social media page and his official Twitter handle was on Saturday withdrawn following his mysterious second preference vote that gave a sharp edge to the BJP in a keenly contested Rajya Sabha poll.

 
 Raja Bhaiya had kept his cards close to his chest after he made a public appearance at Akhilesh’s residence on the poll eve, wearing a saffron kurta. 
  
 
 
 Akhilesh immediately tweeted and posted a photograph posing with Raja Bhaiya, saying, “Thank you for supporting Samajwadi Party”.
 
 Sources close to Raja Bhaiya said he had made it clear to Akhilesh that he would support his candidate Jaya Bachchan in the polls but not the BSP, leaving him in a quandary as the actor already had the necessary votes to win the RS polls.
 
 “Raja Bhaiya’s unwillingness to support the BSP-SP-Congress joint candidate became more prominent as he repeatedly mentioned the POTA case under which he was booked during   as chief minister in 2007-12,” said a senior SP leader.
 
 Sources in the SP said what infuriated SP and BSP was the controversy over Raja Bhaiya’s second preference vote for BJP. Additionally, the decision by another independent MLA and Rajya Bhaiya’s confidante Vinod Saroj to have a second preference vote for the BJP also caused a heartburn in both camps.
 
 “His extra vote for us did not mean anything as our focus was on the joint candidate Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. But what pained us was the support to BJP,” said an SP leader.
 
 After casting his vote, Raja Bhaiya had also met UP chief minister  , raising eyebrows in the Opposition camp.
