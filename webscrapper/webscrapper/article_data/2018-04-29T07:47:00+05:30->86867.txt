Ferozepur: A total of 10% of the applicants for new arms licences or seeking renewal of the same have tested positive for banned substances in Ferozepur district in the last 20 days. Data procured from the district health authorities showed that 300 persons had undergone dope test since April 10 out of which 30 were found using one or more banned substances such as morphine, codeine, propoxyphene, benzodiazepines, 9-tetra hydro cannabinol (THC), barbiturates, cocaine, amphetamines, buprenorphine and tramadol.

 The Punjab government has made the dope test mandatory for the applicants seeking fresh or renewal of arms licence. The applications are rejected in case the result come out to be positive. The state government’s move follows new arms licence rules notified by the Union ministry of home affairs and justice in July 2016, according to which an applicant needs to be examined for mental health and physical fitness with “clear mention that the applicant is not dependent on any intoxicating or narcotic substance”.
 
 Sources said the applicants, who had failed the dope ,test were using political pressure to seek a clean chit from the health depart for getting the arms licence or get the test conducted again. They added that said an applicant with a positive dope test could appeal to the civil surgeon for the re-test, citing reasons for testing positive during the previous test.
 
 Ferozepur officiating civil surgeon Dr Renu Singla said those applicants coming for re-test were given permission as per set guidelines.
 
 When contacted, Ferozepur deputy commissioner (DC) Ramvir said in case of a positive dope test, no new arm licences could be issued to the fresh applicants while the licences of the arm holders seeking renewal would be cancelled and their weapons would have to be deposited with the police station or arms dealer until such time they cleared the test.
