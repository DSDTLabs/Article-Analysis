Chennai: Copious rainfall contributed by the southwest monsoon has helped water levels swell in six major reservoirs in the state including a few whose storage had hit rock bottom during the same period last year.

 Data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on September 28 shows that the water levels in the Stanley reservoir at Mettur have doubled within a month’s time. The storage in the facility, which was 24% on August 31, rose to 53% during the fag end of September. 
 
 Similarly, water in the Lower Bhavani reservoir has doubled. The reservoir in Erode district presently has a storage of 58% of its full reservoir level capacity, but had only half of the current water level about a month ago. Sholaiyar dam in Coimbatore district has also witnessed a sharp increase from 32% in August to 76% in September. 
 
 Storage in the Vaigai dam, which had just 6% of the total storage level on August 31, has risen four-fold to nearly 23% on September 28, said the weekly report of the CWC, functioning under the Union water resources ministry.
 
 S Janakarajan of the Madras Institute of Development Studies attributed the rise in water levels in the reservoirs, constructed over rivers originating in the Western Ghats and flowing east, to excess rainfall during the southwest monsoon. “These rivers are fed by the southwest monsoon. This year, the rainfall is 30% higher than the average, and is not yet over, so we are likely to get more,” he said. 
 
 Janakarajan stressed the need for conserving the water received through excess rainfall. "We get such excess rainfall during the southwest monsoon very rarely. We should conserve the water by storing it in small water bodies like tanks and ponds,” he said, adding that such measures are the only way to recharge groundwater.
 
 When contacted official sources with the Public Works Department said steps are being taken to conserve water.
