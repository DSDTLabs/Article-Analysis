NEW DELHI:   markets wore a   look on Friday.   downed their   in response to a call for bandh (shutdown) to   against the ongoing   being carried out on the orders of the SC-appointed monitoring committee.

 Hundreds of traders, market association representatives and workers had gathered at the local shopping complex in South Extension-I to collectively register their grouses. Shouting slogans against the municipal corporation and the monitoring committee, the participants from   in South Extension-I & II, Green Park Extension, Greater Kailash-I & II, Hauz Khas, Defence Colony and Kailash Colony even tried to carry out a march on Ring Road.
 
 Vijay Arora from South Extension-II traders’ welfare association said that they were being unfairly targeted. “We want the sealing to be stopped immediately and FAR recommendations from Delhi Master Plan 2021 be implemented,” he said.
 
 “If commercial activity can be allowed in DDA’s shopping centres, then why not us?” asked RC Gambhir, president of Green Park market traders’ association. Rajender Sharda, who heads GK-I M-Block market traders’ association, said that the basements of the market were sealed in 2007 and were opened after the orders of the Delhi high court in 2009. “We paid the necessary conversion and parking charges. Have high court orders in the country become irrelevant?” he asked.
 
 Vishal Ohri from Greater Kailash-II market said that they shut their shops in solidarity and the FAR issues should be sorted out.
 
 The gathering was also addressed by MP Meenakshi Lekhi and former Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay. Lekhi said that ad hoc policy formulation has resulted in this state of affairs and municipal corporations are only following the directions of the committee.
 
 “Mistakes have been made by all agencies. The question is what should be the way forward. Sealing is happening due to multiple issues and violations. FAR should be increased as it will solve 90% of the problems,” Upadhyay said.
