Coimbatore: A 16-year-old   from Pollachi hung himself to death on Monday evening after his father scolded him for not concentrating on studies.

 The deceased, B Prabhu, was found hanging in his grandmother’s house at Kunjipalayam in Pollachi on Monday around 6pm, police said. 
 
 Prabhu was a class 10 student of the Singanallur Government Higher Secondary School. He was enjoying his four-day-long holiday for Dusshera and Gandhi Jayanthi.
