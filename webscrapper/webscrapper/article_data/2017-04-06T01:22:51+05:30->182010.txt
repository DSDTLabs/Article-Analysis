MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday asked the   and   to spell out if they had framed any   on banning slaughter and sale of meat in Mumbai on certain days of religious or national significance. The directions came around two years after the high court had stayed the state’s   banning sale of meat for four days during  , which is observed by the  . The court had, in 2015, asked the state to sit together with all parties and communities and find an amicable solution. 

 “Find a solution,” reteriated a division bench of Justice Anoop Mohta and Justice Ravindra Ghuge when the matter came up for hearing. 
 
 The bench has scheduled the matter for further hearing on Thursday. The court was hearing petitions challenging a 2004 state circular banning the slaughter and sale of meat during four days of Paryushan. 
 
 In 2015, the HC did not go into the issue of slaughter as the days specified had already passed, but had granted an interim stay on the order closing meat shops and prohibiting the sale of meat. The bench had then said that Mumbai was a ‘cosmopolitan city’ with people from various religions and communities living together. “The closure of Deonar abattoir to avoid slaughtering on particular days during the holy festival of Puryushan in deference to the sentiments of our brothers and sisters of Jain community is one thing and not making meat available in market so that the public have no access to it and to deny them that food, is something different altogether,” the bench had said. 
 
 The court had then held that the state could not interfere with the personal dietary choices of the public at large. “What one eats is his own business... In our view, the restrictions imposed by state and BMC are unreasonable...and would violate the fundamental rights of the petitioners as well as general public,” the HC had ruled.
