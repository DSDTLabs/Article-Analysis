Manoj Tiwar,   roped in for interesting cameos, the latter plays a chief minister.

 In Nikkhil Advani's upcoming production, 'Lucknow Central', 
  plays an aspiring   singer, a die-hard fan of Manoj Tiwari, who ends up behind bars and starts a band in jail with other inmates. Now, Mirror has learnt that both   and Ravi Kishan have been roped in for the film. The duo was previously seen together in Abhishek Chhadha's 2006 Bhojpuri film, 'Ganga', which featured 
  and Hema Malini. "We were pleased we could convince the two Bhojpuri superstars to play interesting cameos. Their camaraderie with Farhan is something to watch out for," confirms Nikkhil.
 
  
  
 Ravi who filmed his portion in Mumbai, added that despite being a cameo, it is important to the script. "It's a powerful role of a Chief Minister who appears at a very significant juncture. I've already shot for five six days, another two-three days work remains," informs Ravi. Ravi is all praise for Farhan, describing him as a "thorough gentleman" and informs that even when Farhan was not required, he'd hang around to cue them. "His patience and dedication is commendable and my respect for him has increased several folds," asserts Ravi.
 
 He's equally gung-ho about Manoj who he campaigned with during the recent UP elections. "Imagine what will happen when fans see us in 'Lucknow Central'. Unfortunately, we don't share screen space. Manoj was a rival once but is now my best friend," said Ravi. We tried getting in touch with Manoj but the MP was locked up in a meeting with Prime Minister  . The film is currently being shot in Lucknow and the cameo with him will be shot once they return to the Bay.
