CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday alleged that   president Sunil Jakhar was protecting the party's Shahkot assembly byelection candidate, Hardev Singh Laddi, of criminal charges registered against him in illegal mining. 

 Akali leader and   member   said this showed how the mining mafia had taken over the ruling   party. He added there was a set design behind the entire sequence of events. "First, Rahul Gandhi chose the mining mafia kingpin for the party nomination, despite grave allegations submitted in writing against him by senior Congress leaders of   district. Now, Jakhar has been pressed into service to defend a person who is prima facie guilty of theft, a non-bailable offence," said Bhunder.
 
 The SAD leader asked the Election Commission to direct Punjab Police to act against Laddi, including his immediate arrest. "The commission should also monitor the case directly as the Congress, including its state chief, are making all efforts to get Laddi off the hook", he added.
