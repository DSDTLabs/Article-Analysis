NOIDA: A   IX student of a private school in Delhi committed suicide at her Noida home on Tuesday evening. Her family alleged that she took the extreme step due to ‘pressure’ from her teachers. However, no formal complaint has been filed yet.

 Ekisha Sah (16) lived with her parents and brother in Noida, Sector 52. She was a student of a private school in Mayur Vihar Phase 1, Delhi. Her father, Raghav Sah, is a classical dancer and a disciple of noted dancer Birju Maharaj. She herself was a budding classical dancer. She lived with her father, mother Deepa Mala Nutan, and elder brother Aryan Sah, a student of filmmaking.
 
 Family members said they had gone outside for some work in the evening and Ekisha was alone at home. The family returned at around 6 pm and found the door locked from inside. “They broke open the door and found her hanging from a ceiling fan. She was rushed to Kailash Hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead,” said a relative.
 
 Her family claimed that Ekisha was under ‘pressure’ over her studies, but did not explain the kind of pressure. They said they were seeking legal advice on the future course of action.
 
 Ekisha’s Facebook page also shows her deep interest in dance. She had last updated her account on February 20. “Life is better when you dance,” she had captioned. 
 
 Meanwhile, sources said she had received poor marks in two papers recently and faced pressure from teachers to perform well. The results were declared on March 16, and she had been under stress since then, they said.
 
 Though the police scanned her house, they did not find any suicide note. 
 
 Circle officer-II, Noida, Rajiv Kumar, said the family has not filed any written complaint. “The body has been sent for post-mortem and reports are awaited. We will investigate the matter once a complaint is received,” he said.
 
 TOI could not contact her school despite repeated attempts.
