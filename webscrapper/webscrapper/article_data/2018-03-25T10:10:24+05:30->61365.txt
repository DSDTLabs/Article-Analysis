CHANDIGARH:   (  of Old Students), the old student association of   along with Goonj, a national non-governmental organisation on Saturday, organised the second edition of 'Khushiyon Ki Recycle', a donation camp for collecting old books, bags, stationery items and other useful items at the St Kabir campus. Dr  , president, KROS and ENT Surgeon, PGIEMER and  , vice president, KROS were instrumental in helping destitute children get access to logistical infrastructure in remote parts of the country. 

 The event that began by 10 am and concluded by 1 pm, witnessed a participation of over 300 parents and children who donated a large number of unused items to be re-distributed among school circles which require severe logistical help. "The response this year has been overwhelming. Last year we could collect only 50 bags in total but this year by 12.30 pm, we had over 100 school bags and I am sure by the end of it all, there will be over 150. As many as 7 private schools have also joined hands with us this year and are sending their collections to us. This is quite heartening," said Zeena Singh, VP, KROS, St Kabir.
 
 The exercise of donation was broadly divided into 9 categories beginning from bags, water bottles/ lunch boxes, new stationery (crayons, new books, paper, pencil boxes and others), board games or toys, shoes, old textbooks, one side used papers and notebooks and the collections were made accordingly. "A large number of old students, along with some from the current crop are also volunteering this time. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Virksaid, "It's very important to give back to the society. A society develops, when the rich starts giving back to the society. And with events like these, we start a trend. It's important that we begin at the school level itself, because kids understand these things at the right time. If you begin later, chances of learning become lesser. And they should be exposed to this early."
