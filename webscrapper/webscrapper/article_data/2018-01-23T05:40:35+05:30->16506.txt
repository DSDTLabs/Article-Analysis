AHMEDABAD: Is the two-child norm for eligibility to contest local body elections applicable to number of births or the number of children alive at present?   high court has asked the state government to take a decision on this issue in three weeks’ time.

 A case raising this issue came before the high court, when  , the sarpanch of   gram panchayat in   district, was disqualified by a taluka development officer (TDO). Patel was held disqualified to remain on the post of sarpanch and was removed in October last year for having a third child after he got elected in last year’s gram panchayat polls. Patel moved the HC and submitted that his first child Preet was born in September 2008, and second son Zeel was born in June 2011. In October 2016, his second son died from a snake bite. The gram panchayat elections were held in March-April last year, when he had one child alive. He mentioned these details in his nomination papers.
 
 On June 18 last year, a daughter was born to Patel’s wife. This led his rival candidate   to file a complaint before the authority for Patel’s removal from the post on the ground that a third child had been born to his wife.
 
 On October 13 last year, the TDO passed an order and removed Patel from the post of the sarpanch for violation of Section 13(1), of the Panchayat Act for having a third child. The law says that for eligibility to contest elections and hold a post in local bodies, the candidate should not have a third child after 2005. Patel’s advocate   submitted before the court that Patel has got two children alive at present, and he questioned the interpretation of law by the authority which has applied the two-child norm on basis of birth of children and not on their existence. Justice Bela Trivedi on Monday asked Patel to take this issue up with the state government in one week, also directing the state government to take a decision within two weeks thereafter.
