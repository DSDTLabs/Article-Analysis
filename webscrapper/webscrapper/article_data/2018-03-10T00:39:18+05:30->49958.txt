Amaravati:   of AP, Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, who presented the 10th budget in his political career on Thursday, had a tough job of handling cash inflows and distributing   sops to all sections of the society. In the full final budget before the elections next year, he seems to have done a credible job.

 In a first, finance minister spared 20 crore for the welfare of transgenders. AP is the first state to grant welfare pensions to transgenders.
 
 While making separate allocations to all the caste groups in Backward Classes, the finance minister also made an attempt to appease the poor among the upper-caste communities. He granted Rs 75 crore for welfare of the Brahmin community, and Rs 35 crore for the Vysyas. Earlier, the grants for all the communities in BCs were shown in a single bracket, from which the influential sections pocketed the most. Putting an end to the practice, the finance minister allocated funds to each backward community. While welfare schemes for Nayee Brahmins (barber) community got Rs 30 crore, Dudekula Muslims got a share of Rs 40 crore. “We thank the finance minister for sparing separate budget,” former Anantapur ZP chairman and state Dudekula association president Chaman Saheb said.
 
 In order to douse the simmering anger in Valmiki Boya community about the delay in inclusion in ST list, Ramakrishnudu granted Rs 50 crore for their welfare.
 
 Even after successfully overcoming the tide of Kapu reservation movement, he spared Rs 1,000 crore for them. Interestingly, finance minister separately spared Rs 750 crore for grant of scholarships to Kapu students.
 
 Unsurprisingly, the opposition panned the budget. “The budget is full of lies,” said CPM state secretary P Madhu. “The finance minister has, in fact, cut the budgetary allocations for the welfare sector.” 
 
 Since the government is yet to formulate the guidelines for the unemployment allowance, the grant of Rs 1,000 is only an attempt to deceive the unemployed youth, criticised CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna. 
 
 The opposition leader in the legislative council, Dr Ummareddi Venkateswarlu of YSRCP, termed the budget as all communities deceiving budget.
