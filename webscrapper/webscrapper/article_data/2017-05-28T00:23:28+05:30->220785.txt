Bhopal: District court on Saturday granted the National Investigation Agency ( ) 90 more days for completion of investigations into Bhopal-Ujjain train blast case. 

 The federal agency had requested the court to grant more time for gathering more evidences against the blast case accused. 
 
 On May 25, the NIA had requested the court for the same and after hearing on Friday, the court accepted the agency’s request. 
 
 The NIA also submitted before the court a status report of the investigations carried out so far. Sources said apart from other issues like connection between Lucknow encounter and the train blast, the agency is also investigating if the accused have cross border links. 
 
 Special public prosecutor for the agency, advocate Ajay Gupta said, “There are provisions in Unlawful Activities Prevention Act that more time could be allowed for completing investigations if the court feels so. It is under these provisions the court had granted us more time.” 
 
 On March 28 this year, a sample of Atif Muzaffar’s handwriting was taken by the NIA officials under Section 311A of CrPc. This sample is to be matched with evidences collected by the UP Police from the house of Saifullah—who was killed in an encounter in Lucknow, said sources.
 
 The three accused — Mohammed Danish, 27, Syed Mir Hussain, 19, and Mohmmed Atif Muzaffar, 22 were arrested by MP ATS on March 7. The same day, the trio had planted timer pipe bomb on Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train at Bhopal railway station. The explosion injured 10 passengers, three of them seriously, when the train was approaching Jabdi station in Shajapur district around 9.40 am. On March 15, the case was handed over to NIA for probe, sources said.
 
 They were in NIA custody since March 16 and their remand was coming to an end on March 27, when they were sent to judicial custody as the agency did not seek any further remand of the accused, sources said.
