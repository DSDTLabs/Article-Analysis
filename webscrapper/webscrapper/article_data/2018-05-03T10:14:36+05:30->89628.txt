NEW DELHI: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( ) on Wednesday said it has discontinued services provided through   “pending vulnerability checks”, but ruled out any data leak. 

 
 “There is no need to panic. Data is absolutely secure,” said a senior official, adding the problem was noticed in March and the service discontinued on March 22. Officials also suggested that services related to Aadhaar, which were being undertaken through  , may not be resumed as data entry was no longer an issue given that employers were seeding data and it could be done directly on the   portal.
 
 EPFO’s statements come amid reports suggesting theft of data of subscribers by hackers from ‘aadhaar.epfoservices. com’, a website operated by CSC that comes under the ministry of electronics and IT. 
 
 The reports were based on a letter by EPFO Central Provident Fund Commissioner V P Joy to CEO of CSC, Dinesh Tyagi. EPFO said that warnings related to vulnerabilities in data or software was a “routine administrative process”. Separately,   said that there was no data breach from its servers. “No confirmed data leakage has been established or observed so far. 
 
 As part of the data security and protection, EPFO has taken advance action by closing the server and host service through CSC pending vulnerability checks,” EPFO said.
