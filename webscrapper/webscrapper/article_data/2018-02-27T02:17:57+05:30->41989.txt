NEW DELHI:   run by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will now have free access to sanitary napkins. The civic body will also scale up   about the issue among children.

 
 Leader of the House in SDMC Shikha Rai said, “Since we run primary schools we will have less number of girls seeking sanitary napkins. A stock is being set up in every school so that girls can just ask their principal and it would be provided free of cost.”
 
 The civic body runs over 700 primary schools with more than 2.5 lakh students. “We were observing that girls — when they start menstruating — stopped coming to school. To tackle this issue we are focusing both on awareness in terms of cleanliness as well as resources. The doctors and other health personnel are being invited to schools to counsel the girls. This will not only help the girls to attend schools in every condition, but also make them confident,” she added. Rai added that SDMC is committed to provide assistance and help to the poor families apart from implementing a number of schemes.
