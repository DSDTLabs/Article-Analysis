The play, Kashmir: My Unforgivable Mistake, directed by Vijit Singh gave the audience some food for thought. Organized by Navonmesh and   at Thrust Auditorium, Bhartendu Natya Akademi, Gomti Nagar, the play dealt with the story of a man who gets perturbed by the news of violence in Kashmir in the newspapers and television and tries out to find out the root cause of the problem.
The actors, Yajuvendra Pratap Singh and   kept the audience glued, to their seats with their spellbinding performances.
