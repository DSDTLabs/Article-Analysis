GREATER NOIDA: Residents of Sector Beta-1 have expressed concerns about unattended garbage piling up in parks in the area. The parks have not been cleaned in the past two months, the sector RWA said. 

 A brief spell of cleaning was carried out earlier this month. But most parks in the sector are littered with uncollected garbage, which is not only causing a health hazard for the residents, but also emanating a stench in the neighbourhood, according to residents. 
 
 "Garbage has been dumped across many parks in Sector Beta-1. A corner of the park in block-A of the sector has almost become a permanent garbage dump for  . It has remained unattended for over a month. Residents are unable to use the park and enjoy the sunlight in the prevailing cold weather conditions," said  , general secretary, Sector Beta-1 RWA.
 
 According to Bhati, no contractor is willing to look into the problem, despite repeated complaints. "If the situation continues, we will be forced to complain to CEO  ," he said.
 
 When contacted,  , senior manager in  's horticulture department, maintained that garbage is collected daily between 8 and 10.30am. "We have also fined the school Rs 10,000 today (Wednesday) following residents' complaint. But residents and professional institutions too need to maintain civic sense in order to help keep the city clean," Mohan said.
 
 He added that if garbage is dumped after the collection hours, unhygenic conditions are bound to happen. "Those who leave early for work tend to leave bags of garbage at their doorstep, which we pick up during our daily rounds. But if garbage is disposed in the afternoon or many times in the day, then there is a problem. That's what was happening in the case of Vishwa Bharti School as well as some residents' homes," Mohan told TOI.
