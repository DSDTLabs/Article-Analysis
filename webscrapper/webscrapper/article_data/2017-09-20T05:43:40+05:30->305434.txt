NOIDA: The naked body of a man, apparently in his mid-twenties, was found near Tikona Park in   on Tuesday morning. His identity could not be established till evening.

 Anil Kumar Shahi, SHO of Sector 20 police station, said cops received a call in the morning from a local resident and recovered the body. “There was no injury mark on the body, which has been sent for the post-mortem, and reports are awaited,” he said. No mobile phone, wallet or identity card was found on the spot. Local residents were questioned about the man, but they too failed to identify him.
 
 Shahi said that local police had informed the control room and the District Crime Record Bureau (DCRB).
 
  “We have also communicated the information to neighbouring police stations, and asked them to inform us if any missing person’s complaint were registered there recently,” he said. 
 
 Police have become cautious since 22-year-old Pravish Chanam went missing from a musical concert in   on the night of September 8. His body, found next day in Noida’s Nithari village, was cremated without his family being informed due to a communication gap between police stations.
