RANCHI:   on Saturday said the   this time is "not between two individuals, but between two different ideologies and principals." 

 Kumar arrived in Ranchi in the afternoon, after wrapping up her Patna visit, and visited JMM chief Shibu Soren. After holding a brief closed-door meeting with a few JMM supporters at the leader's Morabadi's residence, the former Lok Sabha Speaker went to meet opposition party leaders at the residence of leader of opposition   in Kanke.
 
 "I am fighting against communalism. This country has always stood for religious tolerance and our society has supported the coexistence of multiple religions," Kumar said.
 
 "I stand for this aspect of our country and I represent the poor and the downtrodden. I am also fighting for them whose voices have gone unheard," she added after meeting the opposition leaders. 
 
 Expressing confidence in the support that she has garnered in Jharkhand, Kumar said, "I am extremely pleased that I had the opportunity to meet guruji (Shibu Soren). I also met opposition party MLAs and they have lend their support for me. All the opposition parties in the country have chosen me as their candidate for the presidential election and I am fighting for their victory," Kumar said.
 
 Former chief minister Hemant Soren said: "We are committed to support our candidate. We had taken this decision as soon as her name was announced as the candidate."
 
 He added, "This is a fight between two ideologies and we have our priorities right. All our MLAs will support Kumar in this presidential election."
