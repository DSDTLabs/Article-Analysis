NAGPUR: The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has declared 63.230 sqkm area as eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of   Wildlife Sanctuary (UKWS).

 The 189sqkm UKWS, once a home of iconic tiger  , lies on the junction of Nagpur and Bhandara districts with Wainganga river on eastern side. It was notified as a protected area in 2013.
 
 Interestingly, the final ESZ notification of the sanctuary comes 18 months after a draft proposal was issued seeking objections from people in 60 days in September 2015.
 
 The area has very high biodiversity. About 22 species of mammals, 25 species of reptiles and many species of amphibians are found in the sanctuary, besides rich wildlife including tigers and leopards.
 
 The 63.230 sqkm ESZ extends from 130 metres to 2.5 km from the boundary of Umred-Karhandla. It falls in the talukas of Bhiwapur, Kuhi and Umred in Nagpur and   in Bhandara. The ESZ has left out a corridor between Umred-Karhandla and Brahmapuri and   in Adyal, where dispersing population of tigers move out from the sanctuary. 
 
 Now, no new construction of hotels and resorts shall be allowed within 1 km from the boundary of Umred-Karhandla or up to the extent of the ESZ, whichever is nearer. No detrimental industries will be permitted in the ESZ either.
