GURUGRAM: The government says it has worked out a detailed roadmap to ensure a safe and smooth ride along the recently opened  . 

 There are plans to set up  , three   and 15   along the 135km-long expressway that connects   with   and passes through  ,   and Palwal districts. 
 
 At present, there is not a single police check post or booth on the entire stretch.
 
 In the first phase, Palwal, Jhajjar and Sonepat will get one police station each to handle traffic and law and order on the expressway. These apart, Palwal will get three and Jhajjar two help desks. One police post and two help desks will come up in Sonepat.
 
 Manpower crisis is a major problem that is also affecting policing on the expressway. “We are in the process of recruiting more personnel to strengthen the vigil on the stretch. A demand of 5,000 police personnel, including women cops, has been forwarded to the state government. There will be sufficient manpower in next 1-2 years,” said IGP (south) Mamta Singh. 
 
 Moreover, the authorities are planning to equip each district along the expressway with a fleet of PCR vans, interceptors and ambulances to regulate rash driving, handle cases of accident and crimes. 
 
 On Tuesday, Maruti Suzuki donated 15 PCR vans (Ertiga), two ambulances and two interceptors. But, according to Singh, the requirement is of 33 PCR vans, 21 motorcycles, apart from more ambulances and interceptors, to patrol the expressway more efficiently.
 
  The police are also concerned about the fact that the stretchwould allow criminals a fast escape route. “We are trying to get world-class interceptors, equipped with laser-based speed measuring systems, all-weather cameras and public address mechanisms, to keep a check on vehicles plying on the road,” she added.
