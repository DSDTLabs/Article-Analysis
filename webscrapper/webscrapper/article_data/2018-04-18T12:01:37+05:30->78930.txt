LUDHIANA: The police arrested a 36-year-old man with 2-quintal cannabis, worth Rs 50 lakh, in   on Tuesday. The accused was carrying the drug on a pushcart when a team of Special Task Force (STF) intercepted him. 

 STF in-charge sub-inspector Harbans Singh said Uma Shankar, a resident of Harnampura village, Dehlon, procured the contraband from smugglers in Cooch Behar, West Bengal, and Tripura.
 
 “Shankar would send a voice message through WhatsApp to place an order. The smugglers then sent their conduits to Ludhiana by train. On arriving here, they would fix a meeting place and reach there by an autorickshaw. Shankar used to store the contraband at a one-room accommodation near Yard Chowk of Dhandari Kalan,” the sub-inspector added. 
 
 During interrogation, Shankar told the police that earlier he worked at an LPG agency. As his salary was not enough to run a family of his wife and three children, he took to peddling drugs two years ago. 
 
 The sub-inspector said, “After joining the drug trade, he bought a new house and opened a grocery store.” 
 
 The police are identifying how the suppliers managed to smuggle in such a huge quantity of cannabis by train. 
 
 “This is the biggest recovery of cannabis by the Ludhiana commissionerate in the past 10 years,” the cop added. 
 
 A case has been registered.
