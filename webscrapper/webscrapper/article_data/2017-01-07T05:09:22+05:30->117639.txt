MUMBAI: The   on Friday dismissed a plea for allowing   to take   of India saying it is for the lawmakers to consider it.

 A division bench of   and   heard a public interest litigation by Sunil Mane who cited two cases where persons refusing to place their hand on the Bhagwad Gita were disallowed to take oath on the Constitution of India and asked to leave court. 
 
 He said non-believers not being allowed to swear on the Constitution is violative of their fundamental rights.
 
 Mane’s advocate argued that there is a section of society that does not believe in God and cannot be forced to swear in the name of God. “They believe in the Constitution of India instead of God,” the advocate added. 
 
 However, the judges pointed out that there are some for whom belief in God is more than in the Constitution. 
 
 Justice Chellur recalled that she had personally supplied ‘100 copies of the Bhagwad Gita’ when required by the Indian community in Birmingham.
 
 The judges said that the Act provides two options for taking oath, in the name of God or to solemnly state the truth while deposing in court or while filing an affidavit or any other application in court. 
 
 “No doubt there is no third option provided in the Act. It is for the lawmakers to respond to the question raised before this court whether there has to be various other options or not. We fail to understand how direction can be given when the existing provisions give option to non-believers to take oath in individual capacity,” said the Bombay high court bench.
