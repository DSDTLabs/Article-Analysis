NEW DELHI: Delhi   will celebrate International   Day on Saturday by inviting hundreds of   to tie rakhis in front of the tiger enclosures. The zoo will also be displaying poached tiger items like skins and other hunting ‘trophies’ to create awareness about the importance of tiger conservation in the capital.

 “We will educate the children about the kinds of tigers at the zoo as well as their natural habitat. As Rakshabandhan is also approaching, we will ask them to tie rakhis as a symbolic gesture of tiger preservation. Poached items will also be displayed to raise awareness about the effects of hunting and selling body parts of tigers,” said a zoo official.
 
 Last week, the zoo celebrated the birthday of Vijay, a white tiger at the Delhi zoo. The event saw participation from schoolchildren and a cake was cut to mark the occasion. This was the first time a birthday of any animal was celebrated at the zoo, something the authorities plan to make a regular occurrence.
 
 “There will be more birthdays in the near future, which will allow children to interact with such animals and know more about them. On Saturday, we will also be holding documentaries on tigers, followed by quiz sessions for visitors,” said an official.
 
 The zoo has separate enclosures for both the white tiger, as well as a royal Bengal tiger — both of which are some of the most popular attractions currently.
