NEW DELHI: A special court granted bail on Monday to RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s daughter,  , and her husband in a   case.

 Special judge Arvind Kumar granted bail to Bharti and her husband,  , after they furnished a personal bond of Rs 2 lakh. The court summoned them and Bharti’s firm, Mishail Packers and Printers Pvt Ltd, on February 8 in accordance to the Enforcement Directorate’s charge sheet.
 
 The agency had opposed the bail plea, arguing the case was a “very serious” economic offence.
 
 The ED had earlier attached a Delhi farmhouse belonging to the couple in connection with its money laundering probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
 
 The ED has chargesheeted around 35 accused of helping legitimise Rs 1.2 crore in black money through transactions using shell companies, before the money reached Bharti.
