BENGALURU: A 49-year-old woman was found dead in a drain under mysterious circumstances outside her residence in   near Rajagopalnagar, west Bengaluru.

 While police suspect she may have been electrocuted, her son has alleged that his cobrothers may have murdered her over a property dispute.
 
 The woman, identified as Bhagyamma alias Durgamma, was found in a small drain at 5.30pm, where she is said to have gone to switch on a pump. She was rushed to a hospital, but doctors declared her brought dead.
 
 Police said Bhagyamma would use the pump regularly to draw water from the drain for her land where she grew vegetables, and suspected that she may have been electrocuted.
 
 Bhagyamma was the second wife of Chaddi  , an agriculturist. She was involved in a property dispute with Thimmaiah’s first wife Doddamma. “We have registered a case of suspicious death and are waiting for the postmortem report to know the exact cause of death,” Rajagopalnagar cops said.
 
 Srinivas, Bhagyamma’s son, however, alleged that his mother was murdered and that his co-brothers may be behind the act. He told police that his father had divided the property between the two wives and had gone missing about a decade ago. Police added that just a few months back, Bhagyamma’s stepsons moved a civil court, which is currently hearing the property-dispute case.
