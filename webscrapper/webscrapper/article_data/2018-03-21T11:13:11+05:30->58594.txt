BHOPAL: Even as the city stares at an imminent   this summer,   relies on its traditional water sources to tackle the shortage. The three villages on which Van Vihar is developed— Prem Pura, Aam Kheda and Dharmpuri— on 4.5 square kilometres has bore wells and wells that supply sufficient water.

 National park director Sameeta Rajora said, “The villagers, who use to live here before Van Vihar was constructed, had dug wells and bores which have come in handy. As the national park is situated just besides the Upper Lake, water is available almost round the year.”
 
 
 Moreover, to ensure that the animals get water uninterrupted and don’t dehydrate, additional bowls have been placed inside the enclosures to provide drinking water to the furry inmates. To tackle with heat, animals will be provided with domestic and desert coolers within next 15 days. While the carnivores will be provided with coolers, shades have been raised for the herbivores near ponds.
 
 Rajora, said, “As per the rules, the desert coolers are installed in the cages and enclosures between April 1 and April 15. We will soon install desert coolers for animals.”
 
 “Between 12 noon and 3 pm, the temperature is at its peak, and the animals get irritated. We are taking all possible measures to ensure that not only the animals but also the labours and guards working at the park can protect themselves from the scorching heat,” said she.
 
 Park officials said, “Early onset of summer has reduced the number of visitors as the people prefer to stay indoors during the daytime. Also, the animals don’t come out of the cage and prefer to be inside.” At present, there are total 1,379 animals in the park, including 1,282 independent variance animals, 65 captive animals and 32 rescued animals.
