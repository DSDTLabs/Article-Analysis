Pune: The Khadak police on Monday arrested a criminal on record, Hanumant Dhangar, and detained two of his minor accomplices for their involvement in several theft cases in the Bhavani Peth area. 

 Moreover, the two minors went back to committing crimes soon after they were released from the correction home in Yerawada. Sub-inspector Sanjay Gaikwad said, “One of them was released on January 22, while the other was released on January 30. From the very next day, they had started committing crimes.” 
 
 The trio stole two scooters and broke into at least six shops. One laptop, cash and the scooters, collectively worth Rs80,000, have been recovered from them. A police team led by senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi made the arrests.
 
 Gaikwad said while probing the theft case at chartered accountant Yusuf Patanwala’ office in Bhavani Peth last Thursday, in which a laptop was stolen, constable Ashish Chavan received a tip-off about involvement of Dhangar (38) and his minor accomplices in the theft. “We also came to know that Dhangar and the two minors were riding on a stolen scooter in the Bhavani Peth area,” Gaikwad added.
 
 A trap was laid and all the suspects were taken into custody. Dhangar admitted to his involvement in the theft and revealed they had stolen cash from a liquor shop and four other shops in the area. The trio also admitted to have stolen two scooters too.
