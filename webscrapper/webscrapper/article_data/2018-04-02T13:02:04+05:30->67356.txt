CHENNAI: It was an off-day at the office for multiple-time World champion Viswanathan Anand who went down to Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (MVL) in the second round of Grenke Classic on Sunday evening in Germany. 

 Anand - who drew his opening encounter against Yifan Hou — was playing with black and lost the encounter in 38 moves. On the loss, Anand told the tournament site, “He had a reasonable idea on the slightly obscure line and he succeeded and the move he played --- I didn’t remember what I was supposed to do. So I have no idea whether I reacted well or not but I got into a slightly worse endgame. It didn’t feel that bad and I felt I should be able to hold it. But when I got there, finding moves to play wasn’t so easy. And it just went down the hill.”
