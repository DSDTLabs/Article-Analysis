NAGPUR: The state education   has advised all students to beware of exam timetables being forwarded on WhatsApp and other social media platforms as they can be misleading. 

 Board’s secretary Krishnakumar   has made it clear that only that   which is available through schools/junior colleges will be considered as official. 
 
 Patil’s written statement released to media also adds that students should not rely on websites which have various timetables uploaded on them. “A printed timetable is given to schools and students must consider that as final,” said Patil.
 
 Considering the increased use of social media to disseminate information during exam time, the board is worried about unauthentic data going viral on the Internet. 
 
 The board will kick off its 2018 exam season from February 21 with Std XII (HSC) exams. The Std X (SSC) board exam will begin in March. Practical and oral exams are underway in junior colleges and will continue till February 17. While for SSC, the practical and oral exams will begin from February 10 and will go on till February 28. Usually schools are given a free hand to decide the actual dates for exams and are given only the time frame to complete the process. 
 
 According to sources in the board office, this year there will be strong focus on anti-copying measures with special teams being dispatched to centres across the Nagpur division. The special squads (also known as flying squads) also have a videographer to record crucial evidence. 
 
 For the last couple of years the state government has been taking aggressive steps to curb copying at board centres. The onus will be on host schools to ensure that ample staff is deployed to keep a check on all students and report anything suspicious to the supervising authorities.
