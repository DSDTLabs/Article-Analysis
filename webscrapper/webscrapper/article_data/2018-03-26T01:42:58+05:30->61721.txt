GURUGRAM: The enforcement wing of the   ( ) demolished more than 110 structures in five   in the city’s   on Saturday. 

 Along with the structures, the roads in the colonies were also removed.
 
 DTCP officials said the colonies were developed by local builders on around 18 acres of land without taking approval from the department concerned. The houses built in the colonies were demolished with the help of police amid protests by residents.
 
 The department swung into action after receiving a complaint on the CM Window about illegal colonies in the city six months ago. “We have directed people not to raise structures again on the land or else face legal action,” said district town planner (enforcement) Rajendra T Sharma.
 
 Interestingly, some of the people who had constructed houses in the illegal colonies produced copies of registry of their plot. “People who produced the registry papers claimed that registries were done in Farrukhnagar tehshil office,” an official said. 
 
 “We invested our life savings to purchase a plot and construct a house. How can it be an illegal colony if we have registry papers? The au-thorities shouldn’t have executed the registry if it was an illegal colony,” said Sarita Devi, a resident. 
 
 Sharma said DTCP had earlier written a letter to the tehshildar telling them not to execute registry in illegal colonies. The department again wrote to the tehshil office on Saturday, requesting them not to execute any registry without taking a no-objection certificate (NOC) from DTCP.
