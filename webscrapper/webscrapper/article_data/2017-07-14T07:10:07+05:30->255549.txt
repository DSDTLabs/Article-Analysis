KOTA: The government has not responded to the  , suicide of   in the state,   or even offered them any sort of support, alleged Ramnarayan Meena,   and ex-deputy speaker in the previous  , on Thursday at his residence in Bundi.

 The leaders of both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress party have not raised the grievances of farmers effectively.
 
 Farmers’ unions too have failed to bring justice to aggrieved families. The leaders of these unions are either self-centered with vested interests or are puppets in the hand of the government, the three-time MLA and former MP Meena said.
 
 “No leaders from the Congress, including Ashok Gehlot, or from the ruling BJP have any farming background. How can they understand farmers,” Meena asked. The farmers in the state do not have a leadership and that is why their agri-related miseries and demands for compensation have so far remained unheard. “Five farmers have committed suicide and one died of cardiac arrest, all because of low prices of their produce and heavy debt in Hadouti region alone in brief period of over a month,” Meena said.
 
 He expressed hopes of Congress winning the next elections and compensating families of deceased farmers. The senior Congress leader also claimed that the BJP would not be able to form the government. “Vasundhra Raje herself does not know if she would be able to form the next government,” he said.
 
 He also slammed Rashtriya Janakranti Party (Rajpa) leader Kirori Lal Meena for putting his political interests over the grievances and miseries of farmers from the Hadouti region.
 
 Over the last few days, Meena visited the families of deceased farmers in their respective villages in Kota, Jhalawar and Baran districts and assured them of the support of his party.
