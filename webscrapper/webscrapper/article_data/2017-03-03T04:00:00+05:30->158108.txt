Mumbai:   (TCLL) and INSEAD, one of the world’s leading business schools, have inked an MoU to launch an executive education programme in India. The two will bring in INSEAD’s flagship  , which aims to enable top management executives to discover strategic moves, use ‘value innovation’ concepts and unleash new demand.   and   will also design and develop a long-term programme for leaders of family businesses in India. 

 INSEAD director (corporate partnerships) Jukka Majanen said, “Participants will learn how to create uncontested market space — their own blue ocean. It challenges everything you thought you knew about strategic success and provides a systematic and practical approach to making the competition irrelevant.” 
 
 The intensive three-day Blue Ocean Strategy programme would feature a mix of lectures, discussions, case analysis and simulation exercise. The family business programme will be focused on individuals with at least three-five years of experience in running family businesses and give participants the opportunity to study at INSEAD campuses in Singapore and France.
 
 TCLL president Anish Srikrishna said, “Learning about Blue Ocean Strategy is only likely to push the envelopes of innovation further and address competition strategically.”
