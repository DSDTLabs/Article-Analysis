 “I wrote my first book 40 years ago. In 2007, I published my 100th book, and today, after 11 years, I have come out with my 200th title,” said Murty, addressing a hall packed with family, friends, close associates,writers, publishers,translators and her readers. It was the launch of her latest book, Here, There and Everywhere, a compilation of the best-loved stories that Murty has written over the years.

 Later, engaging in a conversation with Murty, Tharoor observed that as a writer, her stories were simple and contained, and conveyed a lesson. “What’s striking about her stories in the book are that they appear to be true. The book gives the reader a sense that the writer is somebody who has led a remarkable life,” noted Tharoor.
