GUWAHATI: A day before Prime Minister  's visit to the state, the All Assam Students' Union ( ) sought a Rs 5,000-crore financial package for the flood-ravaged state. 

 "If Modi can instantly announce an interim relief of Rs 500 crore for flood-affected Gujarat, Assam needs a much larger financial aid at this hour of crisis where lakhs of people have been affected by floods," Aasu general secretary Lurin Jyoti Gogoi said. He added, "Prime Minister Modi won't be able to see the miseries of the flood-hit people as floodwaters have receded from most flood-prone areas. If Modi is truly concerned, he should announce a policy to arrive at an amicable solution to the flood and erosion issue of the state as a national problem."
 
 The Prime Minister's visit comes amid criticism by several political and apolitical organisations of the state that catastrophic floods could not move Modi, who is allegedly arriving in the state only after massive hue and cry from cross section of the society as none of the central ministers visited Assam when the state was reeling from severe floods. 
 
 "Prime Minister Modi should try to understand the colossal threat posed by the proposed river dams along Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border after reviewing the destruction in Lakhimpur. People of the state will be convinced only when he takes prompt steps to provide relief to the state with a major initiative for Assam. Modi should prove that he is serious about the Act East policy by translating his words into deeds," said the Aasu general secretary.
