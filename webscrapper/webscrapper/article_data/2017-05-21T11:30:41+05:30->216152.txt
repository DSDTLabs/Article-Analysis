SHAHJAHANPUR: A day after the bodies of a couple were found in a village in Lakhimpur Kheri district, the girl's father on Saturday confessed that he hanged them with the help of two others. While police are looking for the other two men, the main accused, an upper caste man, said he objected to the relationship of his married daughter with her   lover.

 The bodies of Sanjay Kumar (24), a Dalit, and   (23) from the Jaiswal community were found in a field outside Kotwa village of Lakhimpur Kheri.
 
 Julie's family was opposed to her relationship with Sanjay and she was married to a man of her own caste a year ago. Recently, Julie had re turned to her village because her husband had gone to Delhi for some work. Julie and Sanjay went missing on Thursday night and their bodies were found the next morning.
 
 Suspecting foul play, Sanjay's father registered a complaint against Julie's father   and other unknown suspects. Bodies were sent for post-mortem and cremated later in the evening in the village.
 
 Station officer of   police station DK   said, “The accused has confessed to have killed his daughter and her lover with the help of two persons. We are searching for the other two now. The couple was hanged to death by the girl's father. Police is deployed in the village to ensure that peace is maintained.“
