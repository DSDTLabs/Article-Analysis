Vaidyas, the three piece band is a staunch believer of music being the healer. And that’s what got the like-minded people   (vocals), Rajkumar Sengupta aka RK (guitars) and   (keys) to form the band. They are high on medleys and weave popular retro numbers together to create a whole new piece. As a band, they thrive on classic rock songs and retro, an era of music that cannot be forgotten. From   to   they cover all kinds of songs. Language is no barrier to music and so they do not believe in restricting themselves.
