GREATER NOIDA: There is light at the end of tunnel for the residents of Noida, who have to bear the stench from open  . The Noida Authority is all set to float a tender for door-to-door collection, segregation and scientific disposal of waste. 

 Though the garbage vats in all sectors are cleaned by the Authority, they brim with garbage all through the day owing to lack of a dedicated waste dumpyard. 
 
 “We will soon be floating the tender for door-to-door collection, segregation and scientific disposal of waste,” said  , CEO, Noida Authority, who did not give a time frame for the plan. He further said that the site for disposal of solid waste is already identified and acquired. “All the waste of Noida and   will go to Astoli in Greater Noida. Currently, the boundary wall is being constructed in Astoli for the solid waste disposal site,” said Agarwal. The proposed site in Astoli village near Dankaur is spread over 145 acres and is expected to be ready by early next year.
 
 While Uttar Pradesh State Environment Impact Assessment Authority had granted clearance for the waste disposal facility in Greater Noida last year, the land-filling will be done strictly in accordance with the rules of the  , sources said.
 
 At present, Noida generates 700 tonnes of municipal waste every day while Greater Noida generates 175 tonnes.
 
 “The daily rickshaw-pullers who ferry waste/garbage from different sectors, segregate them later into materials which they can sell and those that they can’t sell. They leave behind such things on the roads which emanate a stench,” said  , a Noida resident, who maintained that the practice is a poor reflection of overall waste management system in the city.
 
 Apart from sectors 11, 12, 20, 23, 29 and more, residents of Exotica Fresco and   in Sector 137 have also raised the issues of garbage pile-up in Sector 140A.
