TRICHY: Online classes have been started to coach students for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). The initiative, which will also address myths and misconceptions regarding entrance examinations, was launched by the teaching club ‘Ignitte’ at the National Institute of Technology, Trichy (NIT-T).

 The video sessions would be uploaded on a weekly basis on the   channel ‘NIT TRICHY Teaching Society-IGNITTE’ featuring classes by NIT-T students in physics, chemistry and mathematics in three languages: English, Tamil and Hindi.
 
 The online course was started mainly for students who are in Class XI now. “Though Class XII students can also refer the sessions, this online course would cater more to Class XI students because we are planning to upload sessions throughout the year,” S  , president of the IGNITTE club, told TOI. 
 
 Sanjeev added that currently the plan is to upload nine videos a week - classes of all the three subjects in three languages. 13 classes have been uploaded on the YouTube channel so far. 
 
 During the launch event, he also mentioned that the main issue faced by students “was not the language barrier or the economic status or the board they were in, but their ignorance about JEE.” Apart from the academic sessions, the students would also be provided with motivational videos and tips for attending entrance exams. 
 
 The president also proudly said that the club had trained 20 rural students in Perambalur for entrance exams out of whom 13 cleared NEET and two passed the JEE-Main.
