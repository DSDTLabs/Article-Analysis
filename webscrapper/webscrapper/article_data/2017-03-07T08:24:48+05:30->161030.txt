VADODARA: Congress MLA from   received   from underworld don Ravi Pujari asking him to cough up Rs10 crore. He is the second   from   to get threat calls from Pujari this year after Congress MLA Amit Chavda from Anklav in Anand district.

 Raulji allegedly received the calls on Friday on his cellular phone. The caller identified himself as Pujari and asked him to pay Rs10 crore. Raulji, a former state minister, had disconnected the phone but the man called again and threatened him.
 
 Raulji’s son Malav Raulji said a series of calls were made on his father’s cellular phone even after the first two calls, but he did not receive them. “A caller identification app shows that the calls originated from different countries like Thailand, Algeria, Bolivia, Laos, Bolivia, the United Kingdon, the United States, Nigeria and even from an unknown number,” said Malav.
 
 When Raulji stopped accepting the calls, he was sent SMS signed off with ‘Don Ravi Pujari’. The text messages also threatened Raulji to pay Rs10 crore. “These were also sent repeatedly to my father. Initially, he thought that these might have been spam messages like those for lottery scams. But today when he read the messages carefully, he came to know that these were threats. He called me immediately,” said Malav.
 
 Malav said he informed Panchmahal police’s local crime branch regarding the threats. “We may register an offence on Tuesday and will also seek police protection,” said Malav.
 
 Pujari’s involvement had also come to light in the firing on councillor Pragnesh Patel from Borsad in Anand district on January 13. One of the accused in the case Suresh Pillai from Thane was said to be a Pujari aide.
