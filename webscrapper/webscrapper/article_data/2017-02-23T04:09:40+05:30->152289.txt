AHMEDABAD: Famous   singer   may not sing certain popular songs during her concert scheduled on February 26 in the city, if the organizers do not settle copyright issues with a music company.

 A city civil court has temporarily restrained the organizers and the singers from either playing or singing songs that are copyrighted by Yashraj Films, Shemaroo and Zee Music. The court has sought reply from the organizers by Thursday.
 
  This happened after a consortium of music companies   dragged local organizing firm   to court. Novax holds the music rights for the three music companies. 
 
 Novax has claimed that the organizers have not obtained its permission by paying royalty to play its copyrighted songs. 
 
 It urged the court to restrict the singer from singing songs whose copyright belongs to Novax. 
 
 The court has restrained the organizers from using these songs till February 23, when their response on the issue has been sought.
 
 Novaxâ€™s spokesperson said that in case of violation of copyright, the organizers and singer could be held liable for contempt of court as the local court has already passed an injunction order.
 
 The music companies file cases against various hotels and event managers for not obtaining licence at various parts of the country. Last year, such music consortium sued nearly a dozen hotels in Ahmedabad and across the state and sought interim stay on playing its copyrighted music.
 
 While most of the hotels and event organizers settle issues before the event and obtain legal licences, those who fail to do so face criminal action too. 
 
 In one such case, an first information report (FIR)was filed against a hotel on the Ashram Road. After registration of the FIR, the hotel management reached a settlement with the music company.
