 managed to impress audience pretty well with her alleged comeback in Pawan Kalyan-Venkatesh starrer 'Gopala Gopala' and Nandamuri Balakrishna's 100th 'Gautamiputra Satakarni'.

 
 The actress is one among a few stars who maintained a envy worthy personality even after hitting 30 long time ago. She still looks ravishing and proved that she could withstand today's generation of actresses with her beauty and performance.
 
 Shriya won appreciation for her role in 'Gautamiputra Satakarni' alongside Balakrishna and carried a good onscreen chemistry, which brought her another opportunity to work in director Puri Jagannadh's next with Balakrishna.
 
 
 Shriya was known for appearing in special songs that she is not part of, even at her career's peak. Her songs like 'Ne Chukchuk bandini ro' and 'Chammakkuro' from Prabhas starrer 'Munna' have played an important role in the movies' success and now too, the actress was approached by none other than maverick director Krishna Vamsi, who enjoys the dubious distinction of shooting sensuous songs like an expert. 
 
 
 For his upcoming multi-starrer film 'Nakshtram', the director is looking for an actress that could add the extra bit of oomph to the song and the film. He zeroed in on Shriya, who gave her approval to be part of special song. The song will be shot lavishly in Hyderabad by mid-May, with which the shooting will be a wrap.
 
 
 Nakshtram has Sundeep Kisha, Regina Cassandra, Pragya Jaiswal, Sai Dharam Tej among others in pivotal roles. The movie might release in June.
