 The plot revolves around Hans Pfaall, a bankrupt artisan and his endeavour to fly to the Moon in a hot air balloon equipped with his scientific speculations, hope and unfaltering resolve. As the protagonist braved thunderstorms, the freezing temperatures of the North Pole and enjoyed the wondrous sights of the space, the audience too tagged along the journey, holding their breath. And as he finally landed on the Moon after 19 days, the audience greeted him with a standing ovation and undying applauses.
 Though the production by   from the UK was a bit slow at times, the one-hour-ten-minute play was a visual treat, with fascinating video projection by Eloise Carles. If actor-co-director Vini Carvalho pulled out the show brilliantly single-handed, the background score by Alex Paton that suited the varied moods of the play heightened the experience by ten folds.
