MADHYAMGRAM: The driver of a schoolbus carrying 30 students of Julien Day School, Ganganagar, was arrested on Wednesday and the children transported to school in a police van after cops spotted him speaking on the phone and smoking while driving.

 This happened two days after the Daulatabad tragedy, in which 43 persons were killed when a bus plunged into a canal while the driver was allegedly speaking on the phone.
 
 Cops seized their schoolbus at   crossing in North 24 Pargana. The kidswere confused when cops stopped the bus. ASP North 24 Parganas Abhijit Banerjee said, “We assured the kids that they had no cause to worry and would be taken to school safely.”
 
 The bus belonged to a transport operator who had been contracted to ferry the students to school. On Wednesday, it set out from Barasat to drop the kids to their school. As it neared the Madhyamgram crossing, Banerjee — who was passing by — spotted the driver,  , on phone and smoking a bidi. He stopped the bus and had   taken into custody for negligent driving.
 
 School principal   said, “It is unfortunate that even after the terrible bus accident in Murshidabad, drivers do not care. We have called all our bus operators, drivers and helpers to attend a workshop on safety. We cannot compromise with the safety of our kids.”
