Vijayawada: Telugu Desam Party ministers Kollu Ravindra and Paritala Sunitha flayed the Union government’s  , saying gross injustice has been done to the state.

 Speaking to reporters in Machilipatnam on Saturday, Ravindhra said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has completely ignored the interests of Andhra Pradesh, which is grappling with severe financial constraints after state bifurcation. He flayed finance minister Arun Jaitley for not mentioning Amaravati, Polavaram project and Visakha railway zone in his speech. Ravindra said that they would give a befitting reply when the right time.
 
 “There is no comparison to what the state government had sought for and what the union government has given us in the budget. No funds were allotted for AIIMS, Polavaram, the new capital, metro rail in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada, tribal university, economic corridor. It is worrying that the promises made in the state bifurcation act have not yet materialised,” said Ravindhra, adding, “we will build pressure on the union government along with other NDA partners to correct the wrongs done to Andhra Pradesh.
 
 State minister Paritala Sunitha expressed similar views saying that everyone in the state was disappointed with the budget.
