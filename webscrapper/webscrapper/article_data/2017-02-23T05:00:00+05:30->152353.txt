The surplus rains have proved to be a blessing for the avian fauna in the city this year. As many as 223 species were spotted by participants in the recently concluded bird race in the city. “Because of good rains last year, the lakes that had been dry for a long time came back to life providing habitat for the migratory birds. On the face of it an increase of 12 from last year’s figure of 211 might seem like a marginal rise, but what was heartening to note was the appearance of many rare species this season,” observes   of  .
And among the significant sightings were a few rare species of birds like olive-backed pipit, bar-headed geese, ultramarine flycatcher, red-crested pochard, black-tailed godwit, osprey, Indian cuckoo. While the season for birding is tapering off, birders in the city are hoping to catch as many rare birds as possible before summer sets in. Another bird enthusiast,   who has been a part of this race for the past 5 years says, “This is a time when we get to spot a lot of species that otherwise are not found. We spotted the white-bellied sea eagle which was not sighted for a long time. About 8-10 years back they were breeding here, but they weren’t spotted recently. And we also spotted one single grey plover, a medium-sized plover breeding in Arctic regions in a lake. Also this year we found lesser number of waders. These small shorebirds reside in shallow water. Due to plenty rains last year, the water level is high, and thus the number of waders are small. They usually migrate in large numbers, we couldn’t even sight waders flying around in large number.”
