KANPUR:   OP Singh has said that the incident in which a 25-year-old gym trainer was shot at in Noida was not an encounter.

 He said, “It was not a case of an encounter as the victim and the sub-inspector were friends. Trainee sub-inspector   had received information about a drunken brawl at a gym and had subsequently gone there to pacify things when the incident occurred.” Singh had made a surprise visit to Kanpur late Monday evening.
