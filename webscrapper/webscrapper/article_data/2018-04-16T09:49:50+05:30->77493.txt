NAGPUR: It seems Mumbai boy   has found a new home in Nagpur. Whenever he has come to the city, he pocketed the tennis title with aplomb. On Sunday, the top seed pipped the local boy Parthiv Pedapati in the final to win the Dinshaw’s U-10 Maharashtra State Ranking Tennis tournament.

 
 Earlier in February, Aarav won the similar U-10 ranking title with ease. He continued his form against Parthiv to get the better of him 4-1, 4-2 in an exciting encounter.
 
 Aarav, who saw off his rivals on his way to the final, was forced to put more efforts by Parthiv under the rising temperature at the MSLTA Tennis Centre, Ram Nagar. The 13th seed Parthiv, who had caused major upsets by seeing off the challenges of other seeded players, put up a good fight. However, his efforts did not match the champion from Mumbai.
 
 In the girls category, second seed Aakruti Sonkusare from Solapur shocked the top seed Devanshee Prabhudesai of Pune 4-0, 2-4, 4-1 in a three-set gripping final. Aakruti, who thrashed third seed Parthasarthi Mundhe 6-1 with ease in the semis played earlier in the day, had to battle hard before getting her name etched on the winners trophy.
 
 Earlier in the boys semifinals, Aarav beat Avaneesh Chafle, whereas Parthiv beat third seed Neev Kothari from Pune. Coach Ramarao from Practennis Academy Mumbai was in the city for tournament. He said: “the tournament was huge success as it saw the participation of players from major centres like Mumbai, Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur and Amravati. I am sure all these players have a good future ahead of them.”
 
 Tournament supervisor Supriya Chaterjee successfully conducted the tournament and also the concluding programme. She announced the names of the winners, while Mahajabeen Bapuna, NMC corporator Pragati Patil, Aaron Bapuna and Parthasarthi Mundhe gave away the prizes.
 
 Aspi Bapuna, Shiraz Gimi, tournament director Sudhir Bhiwapurkar and tournament secretary Vijay Naidu were prominently present on the occasion.
