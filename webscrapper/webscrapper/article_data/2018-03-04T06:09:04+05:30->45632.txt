CHENNAI: Quick response by a   (RPF) head constable and a few others at the Chennai Central railway station saved a man in his early forties after he fell between a train and a platform.

 Around 6pm on Friday, the Hyderabad-bound   was all set to leave Chennai Central. Footage from   cameras show a male passenger trying to enter an unreserved compartment as the train was pulling out of the station. He fell into the gap between the train and the platform as he could not land his feet on the ladder. 
 
 Immediately, D Mahendran, a RPF head constable, with the help of others on the platform pulled him out. Others alerted the guard and the train was brought to a halt. 
 
 “He was lucky. He had no injuries. Though we advised him to take a complete medical check-up at the nearby hospital, he informed the police that he was on his way to attend his daughter’s wedding at Hyderabad and could not afford to stay back. So, he boarded the same train after taking first aid,” said an RPF personnel. 
 
 After a five-minute delay, the train departed from the railway station.
