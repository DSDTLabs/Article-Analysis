LUCKNOW: The time to save our rivers is now, said  , who has launched the  , in Lucknow on Tuesday. 

 For the first 50 years after India's Independence, the country was in survival mode, battling partition, killings, migration and social and economic burdens, he said. 
 
 “For the next 20 years, we were in development mode and couldn't concentrate on rivers. Different states could not find common ground on the cause of conservation,“ he added.
 
 Now is the time for all states and the Union government to board the same boat. A national policy for   with active participation from people, farmers and all others should be made and implemented in the next 25 years, Sadhguru added. 
 
 Sadhguru was talking about his vision behind the   mass awareness campaign. 
 
 “Almost 24 years ago, the cabinet under then-PM Rajiv Gandhi had drafted a river conservation policy but there was no concurrence from the states and the draft fell through. Today, we cannot help the 4% glacier-fed rivers but the 96% forest-fed rivers can be saved. We need to cross that big hurdle of 25 years and with six different political parties already in agreement, the way ahead should be a clear vision,“ he said.
 
 “The Ganga is sacred to us. It comes from the locks of Shiva and has divine essence. Whether we live or die, the Ganga should remain,“ he added.
