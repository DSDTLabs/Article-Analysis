It was an embarrassing moment for dance guru and   judge   when while attempting a split, his pants which were a tad too tight, ripped. The wardrobe malfunction left Terence red-faced and co-judge   giggling.
 
  A source from the sets reveals that contestants, Sanaya Irani and husband Mohit Sehgal, had just finished an act in which he danced wearing heels. After that, the other contestants and judges,   and Terence, danced in heels too. “Once Sonakshi did a little jig, Terence started grooving to Akon’s "Criminal" from Ra.One before abruptly stopping mid-way.
  
  
 
  
  “Terence sportingly laughed off the mishap and the contestants quickly brought him his jacket so he could cover up. Later he went on to laugh about how he had barely managed to save his modesty and the shoot continued till late at night. He went on to touch contestants   and Abigail Pande’s feet after their act, calling it brilliant,” adds the source.
