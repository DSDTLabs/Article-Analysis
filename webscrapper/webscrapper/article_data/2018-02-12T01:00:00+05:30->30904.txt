Director Onir’s upcoming romantic drama  , which stars   and  , is the celebration of two people with contrasting personalities, who fall in love, through the medium of radio.

 Talking about the essence of the story,   says, “Kuchh Bheege Alfaaz is a romance set in the world of dating apps and social media. It's about two people, who don't meet until the end of the film. Geetanjali’s character is broken from the outside because she has leukoderma and it is a kind of metaphor to the insecurities that we all have in life. But she is not someone who is full of self-pity. Zain’s character is that of a radio jockey, who is broken from within. These two people connect over a cause and help each other fill up the void in their lives.”
 
 The inspiration behind this film, however, comes from a personal experience. Onir shares, “I think inspiration is, in a way, being in love. So, when the script came to me, I could immediately relate to it. Also, I haven’t done an out-and-out romantic film in a long time, hence I decided to do this film.”
 
 Produced by Yoodlee Films, a venture of Saregama, Kuchh Bheege Alfaaz is slated to release on
