Mangaluru: A missing case has been registered by the Bekal police in Kerala’s Kasargod after a young Hindu woman left her home on July 10 leaving behind a note which said she wanted to pursue  .

 The woman, identified as Adhira, 23, is a postgraduate student and a resident of Karippodi Kaniyambadi near Uduma.
 
 Before leaving home, she had told her mother that she was going to a hospital, but called her uncle later to say she was leaving as she did not have peace of mind. After she disconnected the call, he tried to contact her several times but her phone was switched off.
 
 Her parents then searched her room where they found a letter which said she was leaving home to pursue Islamic education, and that she would return after she completes her education as she didn’t want to hurt her parents.
 
 The letter, written in Malayalam, has been handed over to the police by her father. A probe is on and the Cyber Cell Division is tracking her mobile phone.
