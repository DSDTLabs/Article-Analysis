Next time you have an issue or query about your LPG supply or service at a petrol pump, just take to social media for immediate redressal through the oil ministry's latest e-initiative.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday launched a dedicated grievances redressal platform -   -on Twitter and Facebook. It will be expanded to other social media in due course.

 MOPNG e-Seva will serve as a single-point interface, allowing consumers to convey their grievances and feedback directly to the government for real-time response.
 
 A team of officers from state-run fuel retailers and allied services have been formed to monitor conversations and address complaints and queries in real time. MOPNG e-Seva will also provide 24Ã—7 support to consumers. It is these features which differentiates the latest portal from the social media accounts of the ministry or companies.
