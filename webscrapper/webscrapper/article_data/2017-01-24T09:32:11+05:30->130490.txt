KOLHAPUR: Most parts of the city will witness 50% cut in water supply on Tuesday as the repair work of the damaged 1,100 mm   could not be completed on Monday.

 The   (KMC) initiated the repair work of the main pipeline carrying water from Shinganapur lifting station as it has been pending for a long time. However, the work could not be completed as the civic body took time in finding source of the leakage. The A, B and E wards of the get water supplied through this pipeline.
 
 Informing about the water cut, deputy hydraulic engineer of the   said, “The pipeline has been damaged at a place where other utility lines are passing. The repair work is half done and will be completed by Tuesday morning. We have stopped the repair work and started the water supply. The areas will receive water at low pressure and will get 50% of the normal supply on Tuesday morning. We are aiming to complete the work in morning and start water supply at full capacity by Tuesday evening.”
 
 The water supply department deployed eight tankers which made 23 trips to supply water. The KMC had taken precaution to fill the high rise tanks before the repair work was initiated. The need of water tankers is likely to increase on Tuesday as the high rise tanks are empty and it will take time to fill it completely for adequate supply.
 
 The officials, however, claim that some parts of B ward like Salokhenagar will go completely dry on Tuesday due to inadequate water pressure.
 
 The areas affected on Monday were Rajarampuri, Bagal Chowk, Udyam Nagar, Dualat Nagar, Bapat Camp, Shivaji Park, Nagala Park, Line Bazaar, Kadamwadi, Ruikar Colony, Tarabai Park and Kasba Bawda.
