AHMEDABAD: Thanks to the generosity and understanding of 60-year-old Baldev Sindhi’s family, a 43-year-old kidney patient,  , got a new lease of life.   suffered a brain haemorrhage and was admitted to a city-based private hospital, last month. The impact of the haemorrhage was so great that it led to a brain-dead condition, which is irreversible and results in death, according to doctors.

 “When we explained Sindhi’s condition to his relatives, they unanimously agreed to a cadaver organ donation. As he had long-standing diabetes and other health issues, this surgery was rare because of the high chances of rejection in the receiver in such cases,” said Dr  , a consultant nephrologist at the hospital. “We are glad that amid a poor trend for   in  , a family like this came forward to donate organs and saved a life. Recently, the receiver, Manisha Shah, got her follow-up check-up done and her health is perfectly fine. They also donated Sindhi’s liver and eyes,” said Dr Shrimali.
