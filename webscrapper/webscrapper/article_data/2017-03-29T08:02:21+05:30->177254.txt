NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old man was caught   from a factory in Gandhi Nagar. The youth, Rohan, was a salesman at the factory. Two months ago, he was fired from his job. But before leaving, he got duplicate keys made.

 On Sunday afternoon, a beat constable who was patrolling in the area saw Rohan sneaking out with a bagful of clothes. The constable asked him why he had gone inside in such a surreptitious manner. Rohan said he was an   and had been told by his employer to bring some clothes to his home. 
 
 The constable wasn’t very convinced, so he called up the owner, Pawan Kumar Mehta, to confirm Rohan’s version. 
 
 Mehta told him that clothes had been going missing from his factory. But instead of asking him to apprehend Rohan, Mehta asked the policeman to let Rohan go and pretend as if everything was all right. Mehta was confident that Rohan would try to   again.
 
 Rohan didn’t suspect anything and went away. 
 
 But Mehta then put into action the second part of his plan. He asked the constable to lock the factory on Monday afternoon while he himself stayed inside. He hid behind a door and waited for Rohan to come. 
 
 And Rohan did come. He sneaked in and headed straight towards the area where the branded shirts were stocked. In about five minutes, Rohan picked up a few, stuffed them in a polythene bag, and got ready to leave. 
 
 But Mehta had called up the constable by then. So when Rohan got out, the policeman was waiting for him.
 
 Police found 55 packets of readymade shirts from Rohan’s house. He said he wanted to set up his own store and had been stocking up in this manner.
