ITANAGAR: The All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (Aapsu) has demanded that the Chakma and Hajong candidates who have reportedly been selected in the North East Regional Institute of Science & Technology (Nerist) Entrance Exam, 2018 be disqualified. 

  and   from the   Tracts had to flee   in 1964 after they lost their lands to the development of the Kaptai Dam. They sought shelter in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Tripura. As refugees from Bangladesh, Chakmas and Hajongs have always been at the receiving end of pressure from indigenous organizations. Last year, the Mizoram government had denied admission to four Chakma medical students, reportedly after facing pressure from a Mizo student body. In Arunachal, Aapsu has spearheaded the movement against Chakma and Hajong refugees since 1990.
 
 On Wednesday, An Aapsu team visited Nerist and met the director of the institute, a statement issued by the student body here on Thursday said. "The problem is that the status of Chakma and Hajong refugees has been a burning issue in our state since the 1960s. They were allowed to settle illegally in some pockets of Arunachal Pradesh in 1964. At present, absorbing candidates from these communities will affect the academic atmosphere of the institute," the union said. The student body added that it had learnt from reliable sources that a number of Chakmas and Hajongs have qualified for seats reserved for Mizoram. At least eight seats are reserved for each northeastern state at the institute.
 
 Aapsu demanded that the Chakma and Hajong candidates be replaced with "eligible tribal applicants belonging to Mizoram".
