NEW DELHI: A public talk at Delhi School of Economics on Tuesday saw two well-known activists converge to give voice to the goings on in  .

 Activist   and activist and social researcher Bela Bhatia talked about the ‘Bastar crisis’ at ‘Voices from Chhattisgarh’ organised by People’s Union for Democratic Rights and Bastar Solidarity Network, Delhi chapter. 
 
 Sori called upon the youth of the country to “go to Bastar and other areas of India where there is subjugation of people, see the reality there and write about it so that people would know about it”. She called the students assembled there as the politicians and judges of the future. 
 
 Sori, a former teacher who is now a tribal welfare activist of Dantewada, was attacked in February last year. “When I started protesting against the police for wrongly arresting people on false charges, I was accused of being a Maoist,” Sori said.
 
 Bhatia called it a “crisis for democracy whose news never comes out”. She also said that the current situation was so bad that journalists and activists were being hounded out of Bastar. 
 
 Bhatia claimed she had been attacked by members of the ‘Agni group’, who tried to evict her from her home with “police support”. 
 
 She also said there was a nexus between the police and several groups to target civilians: “Even after Supreme Court verdicts, the belligerence of atrocities continues.” She said that there are several groups assisted by the police to continue as both armed and ‘unarmed vigilante groups’ who assist the police and at times kill people who they suspect of being Maoist sympathisers.
 
 Soni added, “Police can go to villages and threaten to rape women, claiming that they have the government’s backing.”
