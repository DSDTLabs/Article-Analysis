TRICHY: The bishop designate of CSI Trichy -   diocese, D  , has vowed to upgrade the CSI mission   in Trichy to a multi-speciality hospital. 

 
 Addressing the press, a day before being consecrated as bishop, Chandrasekaran said that his primary responsibly would be to safeguard properties under the diocese. He has put in 34 years of service and is the pastor of CSI St Andrewâ€™s Church in Trichy.
 
 He will succeed G   whose tenure came to an end on April 12. Chandrasekaran was elected as the sixth bishop of the diocese, one of the influential among the 24 diocese in the south India. The over a century-old hospital in the city was once overflowing with patients, serving the poor at par with general hospital. Popularly known as the mission hospital, it was known for affordable and quality healthcare. As the hospital has lost its sheen and luster in recent years, the bishop designate promised to upgrade the hospital to a multi-specialty health centre.
