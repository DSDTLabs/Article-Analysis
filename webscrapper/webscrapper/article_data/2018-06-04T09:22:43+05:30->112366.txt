SURAT: Police arrested   for allegedly shooting   (35) with a revolver and booked him for attempt to murder. Samuel, son of sarpanch of Mandal village near   in Tapi district, was shot at in the stomach on Sunday. He had come to Navresh’s house to tell him not to harass his father. 

 
 
 The bullet pierced through Samuel’s stomach and he was shifted to a hospital in Vyara. He was later shifted to a hospital in Surat for further treatment. 
 
 Police has recovered the weapon from Navresh, who claimed that it was his licensed weapon. 
 
 Navresh is a farmer who has herbal practice at Mandal village, police said. Samuel, who is son of village sarpanch Kishan Gamit, is Navresh’s neighbour.
 
 The complaint into firing was lodged Samuel’s younger brother Paul at Songadh police station. 
 
 In his complaint Paul alleged that ever since his father became sarpanch, Navresh had been trying to defame him. Navresh allegedly harassed Kishan and due to this the family was feeling embarrassed. 
 
 On Saturday, Samuel went to tell Navresh to stop harassing his father which led to a heated argument. Navresh first threatened to kill Samuel and then took out his revolver and shot him in the stomach.
 
 “Navresh has been arrested and the revolver used to fire at Samuel has also been recovered,” said police.
