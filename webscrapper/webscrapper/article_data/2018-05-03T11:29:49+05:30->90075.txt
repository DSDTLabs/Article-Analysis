GUNTUR: Dreams of   shattered as Tuesday’s unseasonal rains damaged chilli stocks worth nearly ?50 crore in the district. Farmers had kept huge chilli stocks open in the field, keeping in view the high temperatures in the region, and planned to shift the stocks to the market after it dried up fully in order to get a good price. However,the untimely rains wreaked havoc as the stocks were completely damaged in just two hours.

 
 “There seems to be no end to the plight of chilli farmers as they have continuously suffered for one reason or the other over the last few years,” said   agriculture market yard chairman Mannava Subbarao.
 
 Chilli farmers also suffered heavy losses last season due to poor prices for their produce. The farmers could not even get Rs 2,000 per quintal when the cost of cultivation itself is around Rs 6,000-7,000 per quintal. The state government offered an incentive of Rs 1,500 per quintal for stocks which were sold for less than Rs 6,000 per quintal to bail out the farmers from deep debts.
 
 “In fact, the desperate attempts by the farmers to save the stock from rains was also the reason behind the loss of lives due to lightning,” said a senior district official.
 
 This season, before Tuesday’s rains, the chilli farmers were a happy lot as prices had begun moving northwards and they were expecting good returns from their produce to make up for last year’s losses. The prices were hovering around Rs 10,000 per quintal from the start of the season and some of the varieties were even picked up for Rs 13,000-14,000 per quintal. The upward trend in prices was owing to low production in chilli-growing states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and  , and heavy export orders.
