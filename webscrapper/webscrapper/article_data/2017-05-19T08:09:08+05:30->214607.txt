JAMSHEDPUR: Around 2.5 lakh people of   in   are forced to live amid   littered around in the  . The civic authority have not been clearing domestic or commercial waste from the municipal area for the past three months in the absence of a dedicated   dump yard. 

 Beginning March the municipal council, which oversees sanitation work of this fast-expanding town, has stopped lifting garbage from door-to-door and from marketplaces as it has no dedicated site to dump them. The civic body also lacks solid waste treatment plant to treat municipal waste. 
 
 "Garbage lifting is partially affected as the site (near railway line in Aditaypur) where we used to previously dump waste evoked strong opposition from the people living in the vicinity," said special officer, Adityapur municipal council, Suresh Yadav. The district administration has allotted a new place in Kasidih and garbage will be dumped there once fencing of the new site is complete, he added.
 
 Officials in the municipal council said dustbins have been put up in each of the 31 wards for collecting 20 tonnes waste every day. "Since garbage lifting is on hold, almost 1600 tonnes of waste has accumulated," he said. 
 
 "We have placed over 200 dustbins in the command area and the job of garbage lifting across the Adityapur council has been outsourced to three private agencies. But, waste collection is affected in the absence of a dedicated site for dumping waste," said a municipal official.
 
 The residents are enraged as garbage is piling up. "Ward members are ignoring the responsibility of running the council efficiently. Had they been serious, the issue of garbage lifting would have been sorted out much earlier," said PK Singh, a Adityapur resident.
