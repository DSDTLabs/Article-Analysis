Google ‘firecrackers tragedy’ and you are taken instantly to links of the Kollam Puttingal tragedy and other accidents which happened in Kerala. We are officially the firecrackers accident capital of the world, and yet, there is a huge resistance every year to a ban or even a control, of the   vedikkettu. Endless debates and discussions are held each year on how risky the  , the most powerful among all such in the State, is, how it bypasses all rules regarding the matter, and how a small slip could end in a massive tragedy. But then at the end of it all, a huge set of poorapremikal appear out of nowhere and eventually, ‘public sentiments’ win over. The voices of those who have a different opinion, who are sensitive to loud sounds and those who have lost their loved ones in a firecracker tragedy, are drowned. Why does this phenomenon happen year after year in Thrissur, despite strict warnings from experts and two tragic incidents? Do we need to wait for an accident to happen again for the correct enforcement of rules? 

 
 
 
 
 Mob psychology is what comes into play when it comes to the Thrissur Pooram. The vedikkettu at the Arattupuzha Pooram has come down to almost nothing, the same happened with the Uthralikkavu Pooram as well since legal permission was denied. There was no hue and cry. But when it comes to the Thrissur Pooram, suddenly everyone protests as it is like a matter of prestige for a lot of people. They know about the accidents that have happened but still want the vedikkettu. Authorities take advantage of these mass sentiments because they collect a lot of money from the public for these festivals. There are patients in hospitals nearby and many others who cannot stand the vedikkettu but they are outnumbered by the pooram lovers. 
 Everyone knows the firecrackers are held against the rules but even the centre is pressurised to bend the rules because of this large crowd which endorse the Pooram. And so they get exemptions.
 
 Once when there was a move to ban the vedikkettu, both the Devaswoms declared that if there is no vedikkettu, there will be no ilanjitharamelam or kudamattam either, which led to people protesting against the ban en masse. Nobody is against kudamattam or chendamelam. Nobody is against a harmless display of fireworks either, which is conducted according to the rules. The roadblocks are thus the Devaswoms who threaten to boycott the entire festival when you ask for a ban on dangerous firecrackers.
 
 
 
 The inspection of firecrackers is based on several parameters – the decibel levels, the quantity of the dynamite and the chemical combinations used. What we learn is that nearly 5,000 times more quantity is used, than the prescribed amount. The checking and inspection are a farce, because no one actually knows the total quantity of dynamite which is used. The teams keep only the permissible amount in the shed, for inspection. Later, they easily add more and every inspector knows this. Why don’t they seal the shed after inspection? It is during the making that most of the explosions happen. 
 Does anyone check the safety standards during this time? How is it certified? Do they have a licence? No one knows. Also, funnily, there are no means to test the quality of a firecracker here. 
 
 The suspicious ones are sent to Nagpur to be tested, and the test results come only after a month, by when the pooram and also any disasters would be over. We have come to know that they use banned chemicals like potassium chlorate, which were found in the Puttingal tragedy too. Some people talk about a 200-year-old tradition; truth is that these chemical combinations were not even invented 200 years ago.
 
 We are not saying, ‘Stop Pooram’, we are just asking to follow the rules that the government has set, which are continuously being violated. Culture and Pooram are all secondary, the law comes first. You can’t kill a person saying it’s Pooram. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Pooram does not actually have legal legitimacy. The Supreme Court order dated 26.3.2007 has only permitted customary mass fireworks shows as a substitute for celebrations in houses during the eve of festivals. Thrissur Pooram does not satisfy such conditions. The Pooram is not an amalgamation of household celebrations like Vishu or Diwali. It is a distinct event which is bound to follow the laws of the land including Supreme Court’s judgment in noise pollution. The Pooram in the present form clearly negates the provisions in the Explosives Act and the judgment of the Supreme Court in 2005.

 The Kerala High Court has allowed the use of sound-emitting firecrackers during night at Thrissur Pooram but has specified that the noise level has to be kept below 125 decibels. 125 decibels is roughly the sound of a thunderclap and after that, each decibel can be harsh to the ears. The sounds made by vedikettu goes up to 150 and more!
 
 
 
 - Birds and other small animals living in the Thekkinkadu maithanam get displaced during the vedikkettu but no one enquires where they go. No one has conducted a study so far on this, says Neelakantan.
 - Vedikettu in such a concentrated scale happens only in Kerala and the biggest such, during the Thrissur Pooram. Such firecrackers are completely banned in the rest of the world.
