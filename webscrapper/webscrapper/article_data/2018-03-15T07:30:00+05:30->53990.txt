Amritsar: Pakistan’s Punjab provincial assembly on Wednesday unanimously approved the Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriages Act, 2018, enabling Sikhs to register their marriages under their own law.

 Talking to TOI over phone from Lahore, member of provincial assembly (MPA) Ramesh Singh Arora said he had tabled the bill in the assembly in October 2017 and four months later it had become law that was matter of pride for Sikhs not only living in Pakistan, but around the world.
 
 “Earlier Sikh marriages had no legal sanctity. From now onward Sikhs’ marriages would not only be legal but the government would issue marriage certificate under the provisions of the Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act, 2018,” he added.
 
 Ramesh said that Punjab (Pakistan) chief minister Shahbaz Sharif had signed the bill last week. “Not even a single MPA of any political party objected to the bill,” he said.
 
 Stating that the Act was effective from Wednesday only, he said they would soon frame the rules of business and it would be implemented within a months’ time.
 
 Giving details of the Act, Ramesh said the Anand Karaj would be lawful union of Sikh male and female and would be performed in accordance with the religious practices as enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib. He added that the ceremony would be performed by a granthi and later on a certificate of Anand Karaj would be issued to the couple.
 
 He said there was a provision in the Act to dissolve the marriage also. “If there were unforeseen reasons or some disagreement within the couple then a written application had to be submitted with the official concerned, who would constitute an arbitration council for reconciliation and if it was not possible the marriage would be declared as dissolved and a certificate of dissolution of the marriage would be issued,” Arora said.
