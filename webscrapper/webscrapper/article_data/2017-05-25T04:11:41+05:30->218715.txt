NEW DELHI:   is unlikely to participate in the challenge organised by the   to prove that electronic voting machines (EVMs) could be tampered with. The party is not ready to treat the challenge in the cavalier manner in which leaders across the opposition camp have been making statements. 

 Sources said the direction from the leadership is terse — take a responsible stand. Discussions on the issue, after the party received the EC’s invite for the challenge on Monday, have not elicited an enthusiastic response from within. 
 
 Senior managers are learnt to have let it pass when asked for inputs. A key office-bearer involved in the process said the dominant view in Congress was to stay away from the challenge. 
 
 “We are a national party and we cannot allow ourselves to come across as irresponsible. After all, we had introduced the EVMs,” he said. 
 
 However, sources said the party had launched intense consultations to find out if there was a genuine case, and an individual, to prove that the machines can be broken into. Many technical experts have approached Congress offering to represent the party in the challenge. While a section in Congress concurs with AAP that the   is not providing a level playing field for the challenge, the party may not be convinced into going the whole hog. It may, at best, offer a critique of the process adopted by the EC. “Our main demand for VVPATs in all coming elections has already been accepted by the EC,” said a Congress manager.
