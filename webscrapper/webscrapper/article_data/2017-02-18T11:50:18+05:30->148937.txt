Then Mategaokar proceeded to introduce each fort and the depth of history behind it through powerful narrations and catchy songs. The audience sat rapped as Mategaokar told the stories of ‘Sahyadratil Saat Ratne’.
 
 “He is narrating the stories in a colloquial form. It is called Powada. It's a type of folk music which narrated the bravery of Shivaji,” said Priti Ramkrishnan, an audience.
 
 Mategaokar said, “People visit these forts but sadly don't understand the depth of history behind it. Each fort has its own story.” 
 
 The seven forts of Sahyadri are located in Shivneri, Raigad, Torna, Sinhagad, Pratapgad and Sindhudurg. The hour long performance centred around the battles fought and difficulties faced by Shivaji in constructing these forts.
 
 “This man (Mategaokar) is amazing. The way he's delivering the stories, I cannot help but be mesmerized. It is a beautiful and true representation of Shivaji,” said   from the audience.
 
 Music was provided by Shailesh Dani and the event was organized under the banner of ‘Dhanushya’ by SCZCC.
