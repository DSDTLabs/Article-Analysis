NAGPUR:   and Hospital (IGGMCH) dean Dr   (Wahane), caught for allegedly accepting bribe on Monday, walked into the office of state   (ACB) at Civil Lines at 3 pm on Wednesday. Dr Gajbhiye’s co-accused in the case,  , the mess contractor of IGGMCH, had surrendered on Tuesday. A special court remanded him to ACB custody till January 20.

 The delay in Dr Gajbhiye’s arrest — she attended office on Monday evening and Tuesday — had raised several eyebrows.
 
 Dr Gajbhiye had returned to her office late in the evening on Monday, even after she was booked. ACB could not arrest her following   guidelines that prohibit arrest of women after sunset. On Tuesday, too, Dr Gajbhiye visited her office instead of turning up at the ACB office. She is learnt to have managed to furnish a leave application to the government, using her office a day after the action on her to make her defence stronger. She also filed an anticipatory bail application even as the ACB kept on searching for her. 
 
 ACB sources also did not rule out Dr Gajbhiye’s possible attempts to destroy evidence, including tampering with the CCTV console, to remove any crucial footage involving her. Officials are now set to seek forensic views on CCTV footage tampering.
 
 ACB had trapped Mishra red-handed allegedly accepting Rs 15,000 cash from a medicine supplier on behalf of Dr Gajbhiye. The agency had issued a notice to both the accused to turn up at the unit’s office for further action. While Mishra had surrendered, Dr Gajbhiye had kept the unit waiting, leading to rumours and speculation. ACB, under pressure, stepped up searches which included visits to the residences of Dr Gajbhiye.
 
 Sources said officials from the agency’s Nasik office had landed at the doorstep of Dr Gajbhiye’s husband Dr Indraprakash, who is a professor at a reputed medical college on Mumbai-Agra Road. 
 
 On Wednesday, immediately after surrendering, Dr Gajbhiye was taken for a medical examination by the ACB.
