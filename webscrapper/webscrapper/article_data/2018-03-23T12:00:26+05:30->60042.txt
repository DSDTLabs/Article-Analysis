MOHALI: The land and property registration software crashes on Thursday giving major trouble to the administrative employees as well as the applicants. The land and property is registered at Administrative complex in Sector 78 in Mohali. The software crash also affected the applicants in   as well as Kharar. However the system was restored by the evening said the officials at Mohali administrative complex. 

 Mohali DC,   said, "There was a snag in the software which stopped working and we have managed to clear the applications manually. The software has been repaired and the work was resumed normally."
 
 Serpentine queues for property registration at the   office were seen as the applicants had to wait for hours to get their land and property registered. Raghvir Singh, who works with a private company in Mohali, and had taken a day's leave to get his registration done at the Sub Registrar office at Zirakpur, said, "It is not possible for us to get leave daily. Today the entire day has been watsed."
 
 Paramjit Singh, a local resident, said he had been visiting the registration office since Tuesday but couldn't finalise the registration of the plot he had recently purchased. "Every time I come here, I was told that the server had crashed. I have no idea for how long I will have to wait to get the registration done,"   said. There was no communication from the office of the sub Registrar that the system would not be functional during the day.
