JAIPUR: Fresh pugmarks of tigress T-83, also known as Lightning, in   forest area have renewed hopes of wildlife officials that the mother will reunite with its two cubs, after she abandoned them seven days ago. 

 Tigress T-83 at the   ( ) had abandoned her two-and-a-half months litter leaving the forest department puzzled about the security and survival of these two cubs.
 
 A senior forest official at RNP said, "The tigress on Saturday reportedly returned to the area where she had left her cubs. We have recorded her pugmarks. However, it's yet to be confirmed if she has reunited with her cubs or not. We would wait for one more day before intervening. If the cubs come in contact with humans, the possibilities of the tigress returning to them becomes negligible."
 
 The cubs may not be able to survive longer without the mother's feed. To monitor the movement, the forest department has also installed five trap cameras in the farmland where cubs were left alone.
 
 The official further said, "The security issue of cubs is being taken seriously. Water arrangement has been done in the area. The decision to feed the cubs will be taken when there will be no indication of tigress Lightning's returning."
 
 As per the reports, the tigress abandoned her little ones to stay with another male tiger in a different zone. Its movement was recorded in   with tiger T-95.
 
 According to the officials, there can be two possible reasons for tigress abandoning her cubs and staying with another tiger. "First possible reason could be that the tigress is afraid that her cubs could be in danger due to the presence of T-95. Second, the tigress wants to stay with T-95 and so has abandoned her cubs," said the officials.
