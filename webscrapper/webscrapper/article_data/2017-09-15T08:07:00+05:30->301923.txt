MANALI: The   on Wednesday stayed the takeover of   of Kullu by Himachal government and provided relief to   Singh, scion of royal family of Kullu, who refused to accept Himachal government’s decision to form a temple trust.

 The   cabinet had in July last year decided to takeover the temple and form a trust but Maheshwar Singh, who is also a BJP MLA from Kullu, refused to obey the decision and moved to the high court. 
 
 The high court then stayed the decision but it was rejected on August 31 this year. Kullu administration formed a trust, which took over the temple on September 2 this year. Maheshwar Singh then moved the Supreme Court, which ordered Himachal government to stay the takeover process.
 
 “My son Danvender Singh was present before the SC on my behalf and the court stayed the takeover on Wednesday,” Maheshwar said and added that the stay imposed by the high court was vacated and he had to move SC. 
 
 He is the chhadivdar (prime servant) of the temple and he said that Lord Raghunath temple is the private property of the royal family and cannot be taken over by the government.
 
 Formation of the trust of the temple had ripped apart the royal family as Maheshwar’s younger brother Karan Singh, who was Ayurveda minister in Himachal cabinet before he died in May this year, was supporting the government’s decision. 
 
 Majority of the members of  , priests and followers of Hindu deities in Kullu were with Maheshwar Singh who thronged his residence at Kullu on Wednesday to congratulate him.
 
 Lord Raghunath is a prominent deity of Kullu valley and historic weeklong   festivity is being organized every year in its honour. According to historians, the idol of Lord Raghunath was brought to Kullu from   about 360 years back when Raja Jagat Singh was the ruler of Kullu state. 
 
 Palanquins of nearly 300 deities of Kullu come to Lord Raghunath to pay obeisance during Dussehra, which was observed here in 1660 for the first time.
