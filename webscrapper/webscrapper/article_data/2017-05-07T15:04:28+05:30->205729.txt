NEW DELHI: In a bid to repeat their batting heroics for a third successive time,   stuck to their policy of opting to chase against   at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Saturday.

 The move led to disastrous consequences after Mumbai went hammer and tongs and notched up a mammoth 2123.In reply, Delhi sank to another shocking low, losing by an unbelievable 146-run margin, the biggest in terms of runs in the  . Delhi only lasted 13.4 overs and managed 66 runs, their lowest in the IPL.
 
 
 
 The win assured Mumbai a place in the playoffs. Delhi's season, meanwhile, seems as good as over, although they still stand a chance if they can win their remaining three matches.
 
 None of the Delhi batsmen could stand up to Mumbai's pace and spin. From previous match hero Rishabh Pant to Corey Anderson, they all fell like ninepins.   and Mitchell McClenaghan did the early damage to the Delhi innings and, thereafter, the spinners in Harbhajan Singh and Karn Sharma forced the hosts to dance to their tune.
 
 The heroes of the day for Mumbai were  , who contributed a powerful 63 (35 balls; 5x4, 4x6), and Lendl Simmons (66; 43b, 5x4, 4x6). Hardik Pandya contributed a handy 29 off 14 balls as Mumbai reigned supreme with the bat.
 
 Mumbai were, however, very cautious at the start of their innings. But by the time they lost Parthiv Patel in the ninth over, they had already made steady progress. The wonderful partnership of 79 runs for the opening wicket between Simmons and Parthiv set the tone.
 
 The Delhi attack was bolstered by the return of regular captain Zaheer Khan but almost all the bowlers went for runs. Starting from Kagiso Rabada, Pat Cummins and Shami to Amit Mishra, they all struggled to apply the brakes on the Mumbai scoring rate. Zaheer finished with the best bowling figures among his colleagues while Cumming conceded 59 run from his quota of four overs.
