KANNUR:   state secretary  's comment against the BJP's demand for imposing   (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in Kannur snowballed into a controversy on Friday even as his party colleague and politburo member Brinda Karat came out in his defence. Saying his statement on the Indian Army was quoted out of context, Brinda said BJP's demand for imposing the Act to gain political mileage was more atrocious than misquoting him.

 “What Kodiyeri said was in the context of certain cases where blanket power to the Indian Army has been grossly misused to violate human rights. It was by no means a blanket statement against the Indian Army .And it is not just Kodiyeri's opinion,“ she said.
 
 Addressing a seminar in Kannur on Thursday , Balakrishnan said the Indian Army had indulged in excesses whe never it was given blanket powers and had even “abducted, raped and killed.“
 
 Responding to the Centre's proposal that army officers should be given a freehand to take decisions in warlike situations, Balakrishnan had said clashes between the people and the army would happen if the army was to be deployed in Kannur, a CPM stronghold.
 
 In Kannur, the BJP leadership sought criminal proceedings against the CPM leader for sedition.
 
 Balakrishnan maintained that he had not made any defamatory statement against the army , and his criticism was against imposing AFSPA in Kannur.
 
 Rajya Sabha MP and vicechairman of NDA, Kerala, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, meanwhile, said Balakrishnan's statement exceeded every limit of tolerance even by the standards of CPM's track record of violence, intimidation, and contempt for democratic values. He demanded the CPM leader to apologize to the armed forces.
