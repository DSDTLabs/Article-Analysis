A much-anticipated Cabinet reshuffle took place today in Jammu & Kashmir. Ahead of Monday's reshuffle, Nirmal Singh tended his resignation from the post of J&K deputy chief minister on Sunday night, paving the way for state assembly speaker Kavinder Gupta to assume the position in the PDP-BJP government led by Mehboob Mufti. 

 
 The state can have a maximum of 25 ministers, including the chief minister, out of which 14 portfolios are with the   and the remaining are with the BJP. Eight ministers were inducted into the cabinet today, of which seven were new faces. 
 
 
 
 
 * BJP's state unit chief Satpal Sharma is sworn in a minister.
 
 * Two leaders -- BJP Kathua MLA Rajeev Jasrotia and PDP Pulwama MLA Mohammad Khalil Bandh take oath as ministers in the J&K government.
 
  
  
 
 * The BJP upgrades Sunil Sharma, at present minister of state for transport, to the rank of a cabinet minister. BJP MLA from Doda Shakti Raj takes oath as a minister of state.
 
 * The PDP has Mohd Khalil Band, an MLA from Pulwama, and Mohd Ashraf Mir, an MLA from Sonwar, as Cabinet ministers.
 
 * Kavinder Gupta takes oath as deputy chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir.
 
  
  
 
 * BJP's national general secretary Ram Madhav said the Cabinet reshuffle has nothing to do with the Kathua incident, in which an eight-year-old girl was rape and killed. "Our government has completed three years and we decided to give a chance to new faces," he said.
 
 * Ahead of the reshuffle, Kavinder Gupta said he would prioritise work in Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh regions. "The party gave me the responsibility to bring in change after three years. I'll try my best to meet the expectations of people and our priority will be to work for Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh," Gupta told ANI.
 
 * While the BJP is inducting six MLAs as ministers, the PDP is inducting two legislators in keeping with its quota.
 
 * BJP's Ram Madhav and Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh attended the ceremony. Governor N N Vohra is administering the oath of office and secrecy to the new ministers at the Convention Centre where the function is being held instead of the Raj Bhavan as the Jammu and Kashmir government has already shifted its base to summer capital Srinagar.
 
 * Two BJP ministers -- Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga -- who took part in a rally in support of those accused in the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua, had to resign from the government earlier this month.
