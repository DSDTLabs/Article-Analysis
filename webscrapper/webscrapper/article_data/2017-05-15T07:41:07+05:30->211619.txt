Don't fret if you were not able to invest in the eighth tranche of the   (SGBs) last month. The latest   were priced at Rs 2,901 per gram, but bonds of earlier seven tranches can be bought at 4-5% lower prices on stock exchanges. However, few investors take that route.

 "Though older SGBs are trading at lower prices in the secondary market, many investors prefer to buy directly from the issuer (RBI)," says  , Head Retail Research at  . "Maybe investors are not aware, or not comfortable buying from anyone other than RBI." The real problem may be the poor liquidity of SGBs. On a typical day, the combined traded volume of the seven series is around 1,500-1,800 bonds. In the past one month, the seven series have notched a combined volume of 28,164 bonds. The   ETF alone trades around 18,000-20,000 units in a day .
 
 The low SGB volumes pose a challenge to buyers. "If you want to buy 10-20 bonds, you can get lower prices in the secondary market. But if someone wants to buy a larger quantity, say 100-200 bonds, he will have to bid higher prices," says Manoj Nagpal, CEO of  .
 
 Even so, experts say SGBs score over other   investments due to three key features. Firstly, the bondholder is paid an annual interest of 2.5% (2.75% in earlier tranches). Secondly, there is no tax on the capital gains if the bonds are sold back to the RBI after five years or held till maturity. Thirdly, unlike in case of gold ETFs and gold funds, there are no fund management charges on SGBs.
 
 Though the interest paid on SGBs acts as a cushion, only two of the seven earlier tranches are trading above their issue price. Four are in losses, while one is in the green only due to the interest it earned. The calculation takes into account the interest earned.
 
 In fact, in five out of seven cases, ETFs bought on the same days as the different tranches of the SGBs have given better returns.
