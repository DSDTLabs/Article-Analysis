VELLORE: The Paratharami police picked five youths for inquiry in connection with the mysterious death of a 22-year-old youth. The youth succumbed to pellet injuries on Tuesday night.

 The deceased has been identified as S Sasi Kumar, son of Subramani of Mathura village. He was working at a private firm in Bengaluru. He came to his native village two days ago to attend a village temple festival.
 
 On Tuesday evening, Sasi Kumar went out with his friends after informing his family members. Around 9.30pm, his friends called his family and informed that he had met with an accident and they were rushing him to Government Hospital in  . In the meantime, they have also alerted the 108 ambulance service.
 
 They took him on a two-wheeler and shifted him to an ambulance midway. Doctors at the Government Hospital examined him and declared him brought dead. The youth had sustained pellet injuries on the right chest.
 
 Police sources said that Sasiâ€™s friends disappeared when they came to know about his death. Based on a complaint from his family members, the Paratharami police registered a case and began investigations. The police confiscated two single barrel muzzle loaded guns from near the village. The police found empty liquor bottles at the spot.
 
 The accident might have happened when Sasi and his friends had gone for hunting.
 
 The police picked a few of his friends to probe whether it was a death due to misfire or whether he was murdered. The inquiry was on. 
 
 It may be recalled that a 17-year-old boy suffered pellet injuries in a misfire incident near Gudiyatham on Wednesday last. The boy sustained injuries when he had gone with his friends for hunting rabbits.
