MADURAI: The government has been asked to reply to a plea which accused the Chinnmanur police in   district of showing   while holding inquiry on complaints lodged by members of the SC community. 

 One A Sivakumar from Theni district filed a petition, which came up for hearing before justice D   of the Madras high court Madurai bench on Tuesday. 
 
 The petitioner’s counsel said that to control atrocities against people belonging to the SC/ST caste, the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has been enacted and the central government is bringing amendments to the Act. But, the atrocities against those people still prevail, especially in Theni’s   village. sThe plea said that a few atrocities were brought to the notice of the Chinnamanur police, who, however were not taking proper action. This is because many police personnel working there belong to the dominant community in the locality. 
 
 In one instance, a youth sexually tortured a woman and also attempted to kill her. When she wanted to lodge a complaint against him, the Chinnamaur police refused to register it. Her attempt in taking the issue to the deputy superintendent of police also went in vain. In another issue, the police waylaid one P   in the name of vehicle check. Sub-inspector Sultan Ibrahim who allowed other two wheeler riders to leave who were not wearing helmets, took him to the police station and beat him up there. Regarding that, the man gave a complaint, but no action was taken on the complaint. 
 
 The Chinnamanur police did not spare even the army man. On February 9 last, the police picked up the petitioner’s brother, Ramesh Kumar who had gone to an ATM, took him to the police station where they switched off the CCTV and beat him up. When the issue was taken to the high court bench, the court ordered to register an FIR, the counsel said.
