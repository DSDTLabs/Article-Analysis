CHANDIGARH: Political parties will have to get their advertisements certified by the   before publication. According to a spokesperson of Punjab chief electoral officer (CEO), the commission has widened the area of certification by including cinema halls, TV channels/cable networks and radio, and audio-visual displays in public places. 

 The official added that the use of bulk SMSes/voice messages in political campaigning would also require certification under the existing orders of the EC and would be done by designated committees. As per the instructions of the Election Commission, media certification and monitoring committees (MCMCs) set up at state and district levels would scrutinize political advertisements for TV channels/cable networks and radio.
 
 The commission has issued detailed guidelines on social media on October, 25, 2013, which mentions about furnishing details of social media accounts by the candidates during filing of nominations. The commission has also brought political advertisements to be issued on social media sites under the purview of pre-certification.
 
 It further instructed that candidates and political parties would include all expenditure on campaigning, including expenditure on advertisements on social media, both for maintaining a correct account of expenditure and for submitting the statement of expenditure. EC has clarified that any political content in the form of messages/ comments/photos/videos posted/uploaded on the blogs/self accounts on websites/social media will not be treated as political advertisements and, therefore, would not require pre-certification. 
 
 However, advertisements issued in e-papers shall invariably require pre-certification by the committee concerned.
