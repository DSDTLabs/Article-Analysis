Coimbatore: DMK working president MK   said that the BJP was utilising the State government to push its agenda in Tamil Nadu.

 In a statement on Sunday, Stalin said that the state government was not in a position to fulfill any of the promises they gave the public. “Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy is more keen on obliging to the BJP rather than serving the people of Tamil Nadu. The BJP is utilizing the state government to further its interests in the state,’’ he said.
 
 He also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not meeting the farmers protesting in New Delhi. “It is saddening that the PM meets Tamil Nadu chief minister and his cabinet colleagues who are facing corruption charges, but not farmers,’’ he said. The AIADMK government is least bothered about the plight of farmers, general public and of the whole state. “The state government is more interested in raising salary of MLAs, bargain with them to retain the government and continue looting the state,’’ he alleged.
 
 To a query on BJP accusing actor Kamal Haasan as a front for DMK, Stalin said it was BJP and AIADMK who appear to have joined hands. “When Kamal is making allegations against AIADMK government, BJP is coming to the support of AIADMK. This only implies that BJP and AIADMK have entered into a tie–up,’’ he said.
