MUNGER: The results of the civic polls for   Municipal Corporation, Jamalpur nagar parishad and   nagar panchayat were declared on Tuesday evening by returning officer-cum-DC Rameshwar Pandey.

 Munger’s deputy Mayor   and the erstwhile Munger municipality’s former vice-chairman Mohd Shahzad, Sujit Poddar and   are among the prominent winners who retained their seats.
 
 Sangeeta Devi and Vikas Yada were declared elected unopposed from ward numbers 6 and 22 respectively.
 
 Polling in ward number 32 will be held on June 4 as the ward did not go to the polls along with others following a Patna high court order. Sitting Mayor Kumkum Devi is taking on Ruma Raj, whose candidature was earlier rejected by the State Election Commission (SEC), in this ward. 
 
 The complaint filed by Kumkum alleged Ruma had concealed facts about her husband in her affidavit. The SEC decision was challenged by Ruma in the Patna high court, which ruled in favour of Ruma.
 
 Sources said the election of the Mayor and deputy Mayor would be held after the result of ward number is declared.
