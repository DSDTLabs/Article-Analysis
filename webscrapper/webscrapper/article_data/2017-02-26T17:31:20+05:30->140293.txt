Director Rathish Ambat's upcoming movie   has already piqued the curiosity of fans, considering that it would mark Tamil actor Siddharth's Malayalam debut and also see Dileep playing a 94-year-old in the film.

  While most of the details of the movie, scripted by  , are still undisclosed, Rathish now tells us that the movie will have multiple settings. 'The story will have three timelines ' one of which is set in the pre-independent era during the World War II. It will also show the present and another time period that we don't want to reveal right now.'
  Ask him if both Dileep and Siddharth will feature in all the three timelines, the director says, 'Yes. It's a dual hero project with both of them playing characters of equal prominence in the movie.'
 
  The team has already completed three schedules of shooting. 'We have shot a few portions with Dileep and Siddharth. We completed filming the sequences set in the 1940s,' says Rathish, adding that the next schedule will be in Theni and Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
  The director though keeps a tight lid on the plot, only saying, 'It's a multi-genre film and that's why we want to keep the plot and their characters under wraps till the release.'
 
  Kammarasambhavam also has Bobby Simha, who was last seen in Malayalam in Oru Vadakkan Selfie. The upcoming movie is expected to be an Onam release.
