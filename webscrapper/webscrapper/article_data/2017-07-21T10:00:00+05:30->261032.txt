Diabetes, one of the scourges of mankind, can be effectively managed with the right medication and lifestyle changes. People who disregard this vital information do so at their own peril. Uncontrolled   leads to dangerously high blood glucose levels, which trigger a spectrum of symptoms ranging from an innocuous mood swing to a potentially fatal keto-acidosis.

 Some of the common manifestations of diabetes include frequent infections, increased thirst and urination, increased appetite, unexplained weight loss, kidney problems, tingling or numbness of extremities and cardiovascular symptoms.
 
 Infections of skin and urinary tract are common due to diminished immunity. High blood glucose level leads to dehydration, increased thirst and urination. Glucose, which is the most important source of energy for the body, cannot be metabolized due to deficiency of insulin. The excess glucose in the blood is removed by the kidneys. Despite increased sugar in blood, diabetic patients feel hungry all the time as the body tries to get more fuel through food. But they still tend to lose weight due to decreased glucose metabolism. 
 
 Long standing diabetes may result in recurrent urinary infection and finally renal failure. Tingling or numbness, particularly of the extremities point to damaged nerve endings. Insufficient and faulty blood flow can lead to non-healing ulcers or even gangrene in the hands and legs. Diabetes is also an important cause of blindness. 
 
 The associated high BP and cholesterol levels result in narrowing and blocking of coronary arteries resulting in heart failure, and unfortunately patients may not have experience any chest pain resulting in delayed diagnosis and even death.
 It is very important to take the right step at the right time. Ensure proper control of blood sugar and live a quality life. Make proper lifestyle changes, take proper medication and control this multi-headed monster.
