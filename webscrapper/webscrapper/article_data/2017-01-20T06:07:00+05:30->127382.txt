GREATER NOIDA: Threatening a stir against the proposed   in Astauli village if their demands are not met, a farmers’ delegation met Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) CEO   on Thursday. The farmers demanded an additional compensation of 64.7%, apart from several other amenities, but Agarwal ruled out any negotiation for additional compensation.

 “Farmers are now agitating for additional compensation besides a degree college, a stadium and employment opportunities for youth in their area. We told them categorically that they are not entitled to any more money for the land, which GNIDA has directly purchased from them,” the CEO said. “We have asked them to return the money and take their land back. However, we have assured them of providing any community facilities needed in the village on priority,” he said.
 
 The proposed landfill site, spread across 145 acres near Dankaur, is expected to deal with nearly 900 tonnes of waste generated every day by the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida. The twin cities do not have any landfill sites currently. Although the project was earmarked more than a year ago, it has faced constant delays over land issues.
 
 “IIT-Delhi has already given its nod for the project as well as the estimate for the project after its team conducted a site inspection,” Agarwal said.
 
 In 2013, Noida Authority had also earmarked a site in Sector 123 for a landfill site. However, locals protested against the move and sought respite from the NGT.
 
 In the case of Astauli, however, Agarwal said GNDIA has already obtained clearance from the Uttar Pradesh State Environment Impact Assessment Authority for the project.
