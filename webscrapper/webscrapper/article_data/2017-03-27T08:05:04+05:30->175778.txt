LUCKNOW: This was probably the first Sunday in over seven decades when Nasir, 79, had his dinner without a bowl of slow-cooked mutton. 

 In a conversation with TOI, Nasir, a retired government official said that all his life he never witnessed such an acute crisis of meat in Lucknow which is known for its non-vegetarian cuisine. "On Sunday morning, I went out to buy mutton but couldn't find a single shop open and I couldn't believe it," he said.
 
 Adarsh Saxena, an 83-year-old resident of Niralanagar recalled, "In past so many decades I can think of only one instance when meat was not available-in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated and all markets were closed for two days."
 
 People as old as 93 couldn't think of one occasion when meat was not available in the market. 
 
 "This is certainly the first time the city is facing such a crisis that neither raw nor cooked meat is available and I think the government has taken too strong a step without providing any alternative," said  , a retired teacher and resident of B Block, Indiranagar.
