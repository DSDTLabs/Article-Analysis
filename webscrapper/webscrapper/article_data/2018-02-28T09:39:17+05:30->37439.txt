PUNE: The standing committee on Tuesday inflated the draft budget for 2018-19 presented in January by municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar by almost Rs 500 crore.

  
 Its chairman,  , tabled a Rs 5,870 crore budget before the general body with a Rs 42 crore cut when compared with 2017-18 budget for Rs 5,912 crore. No big projects were introduced. 
 
 Kumar had presented the draft budget of Rs 5,397 crore as against last year’s budget of Rs 5,600 crore, reducing the fiscal projection by Rs 203 crore also without any grand projects.
 
 The standing committee, fuelled by concerns about shrinking sources and reduced income, concentrated on a scaled down version and a ‘‘realistic’’ budget for the city.
 
 Grand plans like augmenting the city's water quota by 1.5 TMC after lifting water from Kundalika river in the Konkan and carrying it through a covered 25km pipeline and another project to construct a tunnel from Pashan-Panchavati up to   to streamline traffic, promised in 2017, were shelved by the standing committee on Tuesday. 
 
 “We wanted to make the budget realistic. Revenue is dwindling and expenses are increasing. We don’t want to make big promises but focus on the projects announced in our previous budget,” Mohol added. 
 
 The water supply project has been allotted Rs 320 core and a provision of Rs 246 crore has been made for   while construction of flyovers, grade separators and underpasses have been given Rs 225 crore, Mohol said.
 
 Officials said finances are down due to a drop in revenue from key income sources such as building permissions and property tax. Goods and services tax and demonetisation have also impacted the income, they added. 
 
 The civic body had set a target of Rs 1,165 crore from building permissions in 2017-18, but not even half is likely to be achieved. The income from this was Rs 329 crore till December 2017 and is likely to be Rs 450 crore till March 31. Property tax was expected to mop up Rs 1,433 crore but had raked in Rs 607 crore till December 2017.
