PUNE: The urban development department issued a circular last week, directing the civic bodies to publish the list of fly-by-night builders'   in newspapers or hoardings and vacate such structures if they were found dangerous in the mandatory structural audit. 

 The move aims to protect potential buyers from unknowingly going for such constructions - cheaper than the  . With many such projects mushrooming on the outskirts, the urban development department has asked all the local bodies to survey such illegal buildings. Areas like Ambegaon, Kharadi, Undri, Katraj and Mangdewadi have seen a sudden spurt of such constructions in the past few years.
 
 The list of such buildings would be displayed on hoardings and aired in electronic media so that buyers are not cheated. The circular stated that most of the illegal buildings were constructed by  , who sell them and disappear.
 
 The order stated that people would be evicted from the illegal structures declared unsafe. It also emphasized that the quality of construction of these buildings should be checked.
 
 "If the construction of a building is poor, its residents have to be evicted immediately and the building has to be demolished," said an official.
 
 The potential homebuyers welcomed the move. Naina Shah, who had recently sought details of a building in the Undri area, said such an initiative would help buyers reconfirm if the developer was into illegal construction. "We put our hard-earned money in buying homes. If an audit is done and a list is put out, we shall not invest in illegal constructions," said Shah.
 
 There is a flip side, though. Those investing in illegal structures would face the brunt.
