GHAZIABAD: The impact of demonetisation, law and order, and infrastructure development are likely to be the major factors on top of the mind of voters when   and   go to the polls on February 11.

 Polling for these two districts will be held along with 13 other districts of western UP in the first phase of elections according to the schedule announced by the   on Wednesday.
 
 Locals and political experts, whom TOI spoke to soon after the announcement, said factors determining the outcome of elections in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad will be drastically different from the rest of UP. That is because the majority of voters in the two districts are urban-centric.
 
 The   (SP), which had romped to power in UP in the 2012 elections with 224 seats, had failed to bag a single seat in GB Nagar or Ghaziabad. Its rival, the   (BSP), had won six out of the eight seats in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad combined.
 
 The massive tilt towards BJP in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad in the general election of 2014 was partially attributed by political experts to the `Modi wave'. Lucknow-based political analyst Sharat Pradhan said that the agenda of development propounded by BJP also went down well with the voters in the two urban centres in 2014.
