LUCKNOW: In the second phase of the anti-Romeo drive,   are deploying women personnel who would step out in the evening in their civvies. The idea is to catch eve-teasers red-handed. A team of 15   has been picked up for the purpose. 

 Women cops in their civvies would be walking on select stretches where   and eve-teasing are rampant. Some of those spots are 1090 crossing, CIMAP road, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Aliganj, Picnic Spot Road in Indiranagar and parks in   and Mahanagar where women take walks in the evening.
 
 SSP, Lucknow, Manzil Saini said women cops will be used as decoys. Another team would be present at a distance and catch anyone passing remarks or harassing decoys.She said decoys would be sent out randomly, three daily at different places, and if successful, it would be implemented across the city.
 
 The move follows a decline in number of men hanging around girlsâ€™ colleges, markets and malls following the anti-Romeo drive by 23 dedicated squads. From March 23-31, 3,234 people were quizzed, one arrested and ten were let off after a warning. Only 725 were quizzed between April 1-7 and no arrests were made. The drive will run alongside phase 2.
