PATIALA: Life seemed to be gracious to Palwinder Kaur, the young woman sarpanch from Patiala’s Haryou Khurd village when   gave her a ticket on November 13 to contest Punjab assembly election from Shutrana constituency. The 39-year old dalit was up against SAD’s sitting MLA Varinder Kaur Loomba.

 Fifteen days later, dengue claimed her husband’s life, but grief did not dampen her campaign. Instead, it only strengthened the feisty woman’s resolve. Invigorated by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal’s back-to-back addresses in her constituency, Kaur started canvassing. 
 
 She insists her dalit identity and gender are her biggest assets. “In 2014, nearly 10,000 villagers boycotted Congress and SAD and I was elected sarpanch,” she said.
 
 Not surprisingly, improving basic health infrastructure in the region is top on her agenda. She wants more hospitals, better implementation of health programmes and more sewage corrections. Shutrana’s bane is the widely-reported flood fury of Ghaggar river from neighbouring Haryana, which wreaks havoc for nearly three months every year.
