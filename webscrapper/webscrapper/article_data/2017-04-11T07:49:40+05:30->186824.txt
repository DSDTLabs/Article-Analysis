KOCHI: The Njarakkal police on Monday registered a   against around 250 residents who laid siege to a bridge in Puthuvype to   against the construction of an LPG bottling plant in the area.

 The residents have been on indefinite agitation from February this year demanding relocation of the plant from the thickly-populated area.
 
 On Monday, residents under the aegis of Puthuvype LPG Terminal   sieged the bridge of Cochin Port Trust (CPT) connecting Goshree Junction to Puthuvype   for five hours from 7am, which affected traffic movement badly.
 
 The police have registered a case under sections 143, 147, 149 and 283 of the IPC and the Kerala Public Ways (Restriction of Assemblies and Processions) Act, 2011. 
 
 “We have been raising protest for the past 54 days. Our protest on Monday was a token demanding immediate intervention of the government. Earlier, we held a meeting with industries minister A C Moideen who directed district collector to submit a report. If there is no immediate intervention for finding a way out, we will stall government projects such as construction of ferry station by CPT,” said C G Biju, executive committee member of the samithi.
 
 The capacity of the upcoming plant is 15,450 tonne and around 500 tankers will ply on the road to transport LPG to various parts of state and the country.
 
 “If any mishap like the Chala gas tragedy occurs, residents will suffer badly and government will remain mute spectator to it. Besides, the plant is coming up violating the rules of the ministry of environment and forests and interim order of the national green tribunal. Our demand is to shift the plant to some other uninhabited place,” Biju said.
