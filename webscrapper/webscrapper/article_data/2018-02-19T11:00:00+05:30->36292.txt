CHANDIGARH: The restoration work of the   at   Complex, a  , will be carried out with employees in the building. 

 According to rough estimates, around 7,000 to 8,000 employees of both the states work here besides visitors coming daily. It has already been discussed that vacating the building completely for the restoration work is not possible.
 
  
  
 
 Although the move will make matters difficult for the engineering department of the UT administration, it has planned things accordingly and decided to initiate the work on all the 10 floors of the building floor-and-section-wise.
 
 “Since the private architect has started giving drawings to the department in a phased manner, the department has started to prepare the financial estimates of the project for drafting the tender document and to advertise it to get the interested companies for work. Since the tender process takes some time, the restoration work will begin within two months,” said sources in the UT administration.
 
 The administration will bear the cost of the restoration work but that of the centralised air-conditioning will be borne by the state governments of   and Haryana. “We have already discussed this particular point in details and both the state governments have agreed to it,” said a UT official.
 
 Sources said there is a huge scope of work inside the buildings as various changes have been made and it would be quite a task to bring building to its original shape.
 
 Senior officers of the administration and officers of the technical departments like engineering and architecture have already held a series of meetings with senior officers of both the states and they have managed to convince them for the works.
