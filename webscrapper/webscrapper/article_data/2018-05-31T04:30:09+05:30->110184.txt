PATNA/ NEW DELHI: Amid escalating buzz about   CM Nitish Kumar’s intent and whether he could do another flip, RJD on Wednesday said JD(U) boss would not be allowed in the “secular” camp again. 

 
 “People now know that Nitish is making grounds for making a “Palti (changing sides). He’s creating an image that he’s working for Bihar and   is at fault, so he is taking a stand that he must exit (from the alliance). But all he cares about is votes and how he can continue being the CM,” RJD leader   said a day after Nitish’s colleague K C Tyagi talked tough vis-a-vis BJP and said JD (U) was keeping channels of communication open with   and the Left. 
 
 Whisper networks in Bihar and outside have been abuzz with speculation about what Nitish might do next because of his sudden criticism of the implementation of demonetisation and raising afresh the demand for special status for Bihar. 
 
 Critics as well as independent observers started wondering if the twin remarks were another prelude to yet another U-turn by the leader, and the suspicion was strengthened by Tyagi’s tough talk. The secretary general of JD(U), Nitish’s chief representative in Delhi, was suddenly quoted complaining about being taken for granted over the proposed AI sale. 
 
 The on-record comments were accompanied by off-record suggestions from JD(U) sources that BJP which swept the 2014 LS polls when it contested against both RJD and Nitish, ought to leave for Nitish a good number of 22 seats it won four years ago if it wishes to continue the partnership.
 
 Surprisingly, even as BJP decided to sit tight, RJD moved speedily to pre-empt what it saw an attempt by JD(U) to warm its way into the “secular” camp, triggering a slugfest befitting the colourful standards of the fractious Janata clan.
