 "We condemn the state government and the police for their involvement in the violence. A detailed inquiry should be done in this regard. We want the government to form an inquiry commission led by a sitting judge of the high court," Thirumavalavan said. The VCK would stage a state-wide protest to condemn atrocities against dalit minor girls on February 2. "Our party will hold protest across the state, demanding stern action against the guilty," Thirumavalavan said.
