Actress   seems to be disgusted by  's Oscar nomination amidst his past sexual assault allegations. 

  
  
 The 34-year-old actress took to Twitter to slam the Academy just moments after the '  by the Sea' actor was announced as an Oscar  . In a series of tweets she posted, Wu expressed her objection to the Academy for nominating Affleck, who was accused of sexual harassment while working on his documentary titled 'I'm Still Here'. 
 
 The 'Fresh Off the Boat' actress claimed that by nominating Affleck, Hollywood's reinforcing the "industry's gross and often hidden mistreatment of women." "Men who sexually harass   4 OSCAR! Bc good acting performance matters more than humanity,human integrity! Bc poor kid really needs the help! Boys!" read one of her tweets. 
 
  
  She said in another post, "BUY ur way out of trouble by settling out of court! Just do a good acting job, thats all that matters! bc Art isn't about humanity, right?" 
 
  
  "I've been counseled not to talk about this for career's sake. F my career then, I'm a woman & human first. That's what my craft is built on," she added. 
 
 
  Back in 2010, two women who worked on the mock documentary Affleck directed filed lawsuits against him, accusing him of making 'uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances.' 
 
 The 41-year-old actor's attorney countered that the suits amounted to extortion, and Affleck denied the allegations. The lawsuits were later dropped after all parties reached an agreement for an undisclosed sum.
