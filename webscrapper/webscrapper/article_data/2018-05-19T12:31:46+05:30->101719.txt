CHENNAI: Two idols were missing from the Agastheeswarar temple in  , near   in   district, after burglars struck at the shrine on Thursday night.

 
 Investigators on Friday described the stolen statues of Shiva and   as panchaloha idols — made of the traditional alloy of gold, silver, copper, iron and zinc — but said they were yettodeterminetheir value andif they were antiques.
 
 The temple priest discovered the theft when he arrived at the temple to perform puja early on Friday.
 
 “As the priest approached the temple, he observed that a lock on a grille gate leading to the shrine was broken,” a police officer said. “Thieves had clearly forced their way into the sanctum sanctorum of the temple and used a cutter to pry the two panchaloha statues from their pedestals.”
 
 “The thieves left untouched two other statues of Vinayaka and   that were alongside the idols they took,” he said. “They were taller and heavier than the stolen idols and that may have deterred the thieves from taking them.”
 
 The Shiva idol was 3ft tall and the Parvathi idol was 2ft tall, the temple priest told investigators. He recalled placing the idols on their pedestals within the temple more than five years ago, leading the police to suspect that the burglary could have been an inside job. The police have informed the idol wing about the case.
 
 “Wehavesomesecurity camera footage from nearby,” the officer said, adding, however, that investigators were not hopeful of obtaining leads from the tapes because they were from a poorly-lit stretch.
