MUMBAI: The   has directed banks to ensure that the higher withdrawal limit of Rs 4,500 is dispensed in a combination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes.

 This is to ensure that ATMs do not run dry soon and there is enough lower denomination notes to provide liquidity to the Rs 2,000 notes.
 
 Late on Friday, RBI had instructed banks to hike the daily withdrawal limit from ATMs to Rs 4,500 from the existing Rs 2,500 without increasing the weekly limit of Rs 24,000. The central bank had also said that such disbursals should predominantly be in the denomination of Rs 500.
 
 Banks said on one hand there was a shortage of funds but at the same time customers were shunning ATMs where withdrawal was available only in Rs 2,000 notes.
 
 “Rs 4,500 is more than the average withdrawal from an ATM pre-demonetisation, which was around Rs 3,500 in cities,” said a bank official.
 
 But the main problem faced by banks was that due to the shortage of Rs 500 denomination notes they were refilling ATMs with a combination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 100 notes. However, customers were draining the Rs 100 denomination notes from ATMs by withdrawing odd amounts.
 
 With supply of the Rs 500 notes picking up, banks are expecting ATMs to remain live much longer. Although currency presses are now largely printing Rs 500 notes and stopped printing Rs 2,000 notes, banks are seeing a large number of Rs 2,000 denomination notes coming back as deposits.
