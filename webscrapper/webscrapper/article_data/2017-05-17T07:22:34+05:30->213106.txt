KOLKATA: A fire broke out at a tea shop and a photocopy store on the ground floor of the 10-storey Kohinoor building on   on Tuesday morning. The two shops were divided by a partition.

 Five fire tenders took one and a half hours to douse the flames. None was injured.butresidence panicked on seeing thick black smoke bellowing towards Mullick Bazaar. Cops have initiated a probe and the exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained but a tea shop employee has told police about a gas leak.
 
 Somnath Pramanik, a fire station officer said the fire might have started due to a short circuit from two photo copy machines, which were out of order or a gas leak from one of the four commercial cylinders recovered from the shop.
 
 “We have recovered four commercial cylinders. We also found two fire extinguis hers but we are not sure whether they were in working condition or anyone knew how to use them,“ said Pramanik.
 
 A case has been registered at the Park Street police station.
