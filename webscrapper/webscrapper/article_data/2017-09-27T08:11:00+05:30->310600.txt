 “During the session, Dr Sharma alerted us about the various abuses a child faces in his/her day-to-day life. We were advised to talk to our children on a regular basis and have a clear perception of what’s going on in our child’s mind. We were also asked to stop our child from knowing the grave details of Pradhyumn’s murder,” said Shipra Dave, whose daughter was Pradhyumn’s classmate. 
 
 Dr Shweta Sharma, when approached, said, “The detailed coverage of Pradhyumn’s murder by television channels has impacted the parents severely.

 Meanwhile, Amul Garg, a Class 9 student, said, “Since the reopening of the school on Monday, the principal is personally overseeing students entering and exiting the school. Moreover, we are being given instructions regularly and our teachers have asked us not to go near the new building.”
