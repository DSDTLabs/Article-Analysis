Nagpur: Finally, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) transport department has given its nod to three Red Rus operators to procure and ply 45 mini-buses to cater to all areas of the city.

 Taking cognisance of TOI’s report on delay in procurement of these buses, transport committee chairman Bunty Kukde had convened a meeting and issued directives to the transport department to start the process of procurement soon.
 
 As per an agreement with NMC, the three city bus operators need to ply 15 mini-buses each. On Tuesday, a presentation of features of the bus and its colour was made before the transport department officials, including Kukde and transport manager Shivaji Jagtap. Of the five colour options, the BJP ruled-NMC has finalized orange flag and green flag for the mini-buses, which will have a seating capacity of 23 passengers. 
 
 Currently, not a single such bus is plying in the city and TOI had highlighted that mini-buses are needed in congested areas, where the roads are so narrow that regular buses cannot enter. If regular buses are used, it may lead to traffic jams. Residents of congested areas have been demanding mini-buses since years.
 
 To start with, NMC will introduce six buses on August 15, Kukde said, adding all 39 buses will start plying by September-end this year. 
 
 Kukde appealed to citizens of congested areas to put up demands with timings to connect their areas to main road. The requests can be sent to NMC’s transport department so that routes will be charted out. 
 
 Currently, the three city bus operators are plying around 250 buses against a requirement of 427 for smooth operations. These buses are operating on 65 routes. Former operator Vansh Nimay Infratech used to operate around 200 buses.
 
 NMC’s plan of plying 55 ethanol-fuelled green buses is also yet to take off. Against its commitment, the operator Scania is plying only five buses.
