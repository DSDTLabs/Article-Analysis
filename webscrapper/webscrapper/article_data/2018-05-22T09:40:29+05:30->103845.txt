HYDERABAD:   health department has drawn up a first of-its-kind   policy to improve the overall experience at state-run health facilities, especially for people awaiting post mortem examination or handover of bodies.

 As per plan, mortuaries across government hospitals in the state will be upgraded with modern facilities to allow them to operate round-theclock. At present, at least 1,000 bodies require post-mortem examination in Telangana daily. But given the constraints of the current set up, these can be done only during the day-time. So, mortuaries are open only up to 5pm. In case an examination isn’t completed in time, it is carried over to the next day.
 
 “While we have been focussing on upgrading   infrastructure, mortuaries are the place where distressed people have to wait before taking the body of their loved ones home. Usually, mortuaries and post-mortem examination rooms are dirty, making the wait even more difficult. We wanted to create a good ambience for people, where they can sit comfortably for a while in their time of distress,” said C  , minister for health and family welfare, government of Telangana.
