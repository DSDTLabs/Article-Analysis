PATNA: The murder of a constable’s son by another policeman at the Police Lines in Patna on Tuesday has raised concern over the safety and security of the policemen living in quarters in the city and other districts. 

 Constable   (40), said to be mentally unstable, shot his colleague Rajendra Singh’s son Deepak Kumar Singh (22) at a Police Lines quarter at   on Tuesday morning.
 
 One of the police personnel living at the Police Lines said anyone could enter the premises. “After the Tuesday incident, security at the entrance has been increased, but this will hardly continue even for a week,” he said.
 
 Another policeman said encroachment at the Police Lines is one of the major problems, but senior officer have turned a blind eye. He also said the quarters and barrack buildings are in dilapidated condition. “Several months back, an anti-encroachment drive was undertaken on pick and choose basis. Illegal temporary and permanent structures built by those having good connection with officers were spared,” he alleged, adding several unauthorized policemen live there.
 
 However, Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said security of the Police Lines had been increased after some Bihar Police Men’s Association office-bearers were caught in an inebriated state on the campus. “After the incident, CCTV cameras were installed at the entrance and different locations inside the campus,” he said, adding only the family members of police personnel are allowed to go inside the premises.
 
 The SSP also said encroachments had been removed and if any remained would also be removed as construction of a new Police Lines on the same premises is to begin soon.
 
 “A women’s barrack for around 350 police personnel has come up and the building will be inaugurated probably in a fortnight,” the SSP said, adding inspections are conducted on a regular basis.
