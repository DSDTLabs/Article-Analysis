  : Summer is here and students studying in government schools have to sit through stiffling classrooms because almost 60% of state run schools in the district have  . 

 As per official records of district administration, as on December 2016 there are 2,689 government schools in the district. This includes primary, upper primary and high schools. Among them 1,635 schools have no electricity connection. This means that close to what is the smartest of Indian cities, Bhubaneswar, most children studying in government run schools in the district do not have fans in their classrooms.
 
 "I have seen my students profusely sweating during class. How can they concentrate on studies?" said Sandhya, a teacher of a school that does not have electricity.
 
 Authorities ascribe inaccessibility of schools as a hurdle to their electrification. "Some other schools have huge outstanding electricity bills due to which their connection has been snapped," said an officer of district education wing.
 
 Officials claim measures are being taken. "The new school buildings which have been constructed in recent years have proper electricity supply. I have asked schools which have outstanding electricity bills to submit their details so that we can try to help them in paying their arrears," said the Cuttack project coordinator of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, Gadadhar Behera. 
 
 He also said electrification work in the schools will be done in a phase-wise manner
