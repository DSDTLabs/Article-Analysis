ERODE: Upset over frequent quarrels with her second husband, a 35-year-old woman fed poison to her 14-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter before attempting to kill herself by consuming the same at her house in   in Chennimalai here on Friday. 

 While the mother and the boy died, the girl is battling for life at the government hospital in Erode.
 
 The deceased were identified as S  , wife of  , 36, of Chennimalai, and her son Yuvaraj, a Class VIII student of a government school in the same locality. Her daughter Pooja was admitted to the government hospital.
 
 According to police, Uma Maheswari was a homemaker, while Sakthinathan was a painter. “Uma used to fight with her husband often as she couldn’t make both ends meet with the meagre amount earned by Sakthinathan, who was often out of work. On Thursday night, the couple as usual picked up a quarrel and fought each other,” an investigation officer said.
 
 After the fight, Sakthinathan went out of the house. Upset, Uma first fed poison to her children and later she also consumed the same. When Sakthinathan returned home, he found the trio lying unconscious on the ground with froth in their mouth.
 
 Immediately, Sakthinathan, along with others, rushed them to the government hospital in Erode. But Uma and her son died without responding to the treatment at the hospital on the early hours of Friday. “Pooja is battling for her life,” the officer said.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that Uma was first married to Sundarrajan of   in   district. She separated from him and married Sakthinathan two years ago, the officer said.
 
 “She was apparently disappointed over the frequent quarrels with her second husband,” the police said and added that the exact reason that drove her to take the extreme step would be ascertained only after a detailed inquiry.
