LUDHIANA: Seeking improvement in the   of the   lot opposite MC’s A Zone office near  , mayor   visited the lot on Tuesday. He has asked the contractor to maintain cleanliness there, especially on the fourth floor, where the condition was not up to the mark. The mayor had visited the lot a few days ago as well, and at that time too, he had asked the contractor’s staff to keep the place clean.

 
 The mayor visited all floors of the parking lot, and checked the ongoing cleaning work. He said they had appointed some of their staff to help the contractor’s men in cleaning the parking lot. He said the existing contract will end in July, and a new contractor would be hired for the task, so they will add cleaning and maintenance work in the contract. 
 
 MC had spent Rs 32 crore on construction of the multi-level parking lot in 1994, and on the terrace of the building, there was a proposal to start a restaurant for more revenue generation, but the authorities could not go ahead with that plan. The parking lot has remained in a shambles most of the time, and the terrace is covered with grass and fungus. Due to the parking lot’s poor condition, very few people use it for parking their vehicles.
