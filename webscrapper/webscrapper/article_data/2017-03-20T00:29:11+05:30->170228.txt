MUMBAI: Mangaluru resident   (52) was arrested from Sahar airport on Friday after she was   where she had been living for the last 13 years. 

 Officials said she had managed to stay there without a legal Indian  . She was produced before the Andheri court, which remanded her in custody till Monday. 
 
 Flavia’s husband divorced her in 2002 after which she came in contact with a travel agent. Flavia claimed that the travel agent from Mangaluru duped her after getting married to her. The agent got her a fake passport after charging Rs 50,000. However, after reaching Canada, the agent disappeared without handing over her passport or any valid documents. 
 
 Investigators said they are collecting information in connection with the case that dates back to 2004, when Flavia flew to Montreal. 
 
 In Canada, Flavia managed to get asylum, but a court objected her stay after she sought permanent residency recently. “Flavia is booked for cheating the immigration officials in Mumbai. We are investigating how she managed to clear the immigration check then and lived in   for more than a decade,” said B T Mukhedkar, senior inspector of Sahar police station.
 
 Flavia flew to Canada where she worked in a private firm and later as a domestic help. 
 
 “Flavia said that she had taken a flight from Mumbai in 2004. After reaching Canada, she was caught and sought asylum from the local authorities. She managed to get her asylum renewed every year for the last 13 years. She was deported after the Canadian authorities decided not to extend her asylum. She then made a request to the Indian High Commission in Ottawa and it issued an emergency certificate to allow her to fly back,” said sub-inspector Rahul Sonawane.
 
 “Flavia is a victim of the agent who arranged her   and passport,” her lawyer Prabhakar Tripathi told TOI.
