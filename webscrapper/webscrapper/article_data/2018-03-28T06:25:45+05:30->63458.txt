BENGALURU: The move by the   to start collecting toll from Tuesday at   from vehicles heading to the   has been put off.

 The Navayuga Devanahalli Toll Plaza (NDTPL), which operates the booth, had planned to start collecting the toll from Monday midnight.
 
 An official from the NDTPL said the move has been delayed as the required number of police personnel was not deployed for security and protection of their personnel at the booth. The   at Sadahalli plaza a few years ago had witnessed large-scale violence with road users attacking NDTPL personnel.
 
 Currently, motorists pay a cumulative toll fee for journeys to and from the airport when driving to the city. Under the new system, motorists will be paying one-way toll on their outward or return trips, or choose to pay on the first trip. The cumulative toll fee is valid for 24 hours.
