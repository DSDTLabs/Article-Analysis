This will help people to file their appeals in Surat rather than coming all the way to Ahmedabad, said an official.
 
 “On July 24, the notification was issued for setting up of the Surat bench. The cases of Surat and other areas of   will now be heard at  . These cases were earlier heard by Ahmedabad bench,” said an I-T official. 
 
 “The bench at Surat is likely to be made functional within next two months. While the ITAT is looking for suitable place, it may temporarily function from   office premises. 
 
 The ITAT bench in Surat will offer opportunities to lawyers and chartered accountants in Surat as ITAT is a formal court requiring expertise, said officials.
 
 It is estimated that at present there are around 4,000 appeals which will be transferred to Surat bench.
 
 The ITAT is oldest Tribunal in India, set up in 1941, and on the questions of facts, its decisions are final. On the substantial questions of law, however, ITAT decisions can be appealed in the high court.
