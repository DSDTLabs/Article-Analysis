ITANAGAR: The   ( ) on Sunday dismissed chief minister  's claim that BJP will win all 60 seats in the assembly election next year, saying that it would be possible "only if electronic voting machines ( ) malfunctioned". 

 PPA president Kahfa Bengia on Sunday said, "It is not only Khandu, but also BJP ministers from other states who are making similar claims." The reason, he insinuated, was manipulation of the poll process by BJP. "There have been numerous instances when opposition parties have raised questions about the robustness and reliability of EVMs. When Pema Khandu is going around making overconfident and baseless statements like saying BJP's failed government will win all 60 seats in the Arunachal state assembly election, one can only wonder if he has made some arrangements to tamper with EVMs," he added.
 
 PPA claimed that during a visit to Yupia, it learnt that around 20 out of 300 EVMs with the district electoral officer's office have been rejected because of faults. Referring to alleged instances of faulty EVMs in the recent bypolls in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, PPA said it is a worrying trend. The statement by Khandu had invited criticism from Congress as well, which said that it was a "tall claim" and that BJP would not even be able to complete a full term in office.
