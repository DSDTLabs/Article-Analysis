MANSA: Former president of Mansa municipal council and sitting councillor Balwinder Singh Kaka, owing allegiance to SAD, has challenged the appointment of   Gora as the civic body new chief before the Punjab and   high court. The court has posted the matter to January 29. 

 Gora had assumed the charge as   president on January 15, after he dumped SAD for  . In his petition filed in the court on Wednesday, Kaka prayed that the matter pertaining to his appeal against removing him from the post through no confidence motion was pending in the court. He also claimed that the local government department had assured the court that no new president of Mansa MC be appointed till the old matter was solved.
 
 Kaka was removed as the Mansa MC president on May 18, 2016. Due to sheer factionalism among   councillors, no one could be appointed in his place since then. On December 19, 2016,   was appointed as the president but the notification could not be issued. Last week, the notification was issued on Mandeep assuming the office.
 
 “Seventeen out of 27 councillors have reposed faith in me and gave affidavits to reinstall me as the president in December 2016. I approached the court and the local government department assured the court that no one will be appointed as the president till the matter was decided. Despite that Gora has been appointed as the president. I have approached the court against it,” Kaka said.
 
 On the other hand, Mandeep said, “The councillors had given affidavits in my favour as well. As the court had not issued stay on the appointment of the new president, the state government issued a notification for my appointment. The matter will be heard on January 29.”
 
 Mansa MC executive officer   said the old matter was pending in court but as no stay was there, the state government had issued notification about Mandeep being the civic body’s president. “The council has got the copy of the notification,” he said.
