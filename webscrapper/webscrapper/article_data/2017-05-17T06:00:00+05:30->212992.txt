Kolkata: Waking up from a sluggish approach to solve   payers’ grievances related to the switchover to unit area assessment (UAA), the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) top brass on Monday asked the assessment department officials to attend to all citizens — whoever visits a   UAA help desk — irrespective of the jurisdiction of their areas. 

 The KMC authorities on Monday decided not to refuse anyone who would visit the help desks. The initiative was taken after TOI reported how citizens were being harassed at the help desks when they turned up to inquire about the modalities of the new UAA scheme.
 
 Shahzad Shibli, the KMC joint municipal commissioner, on Monday convened a meeting where he gave a piece of his mind. Shibli made it clear that he was unhappy with the manner the KMC personnel at the help desks were working. “Be patient. Try to attend every single tax payer who will turn up expecting help from your end. Explain them the nuances of the new UAA system so that no error occurs when they fill in the form themselves,” Shibli told the KMC assessment department officials.
 
 A section of civic officials was alerted for not being able to explain certain aspects of the scheme. “Get trained, understand the subject and give right suggestions to tax payers who want to switch over to UAA,” the joint municipal commissioner told the KMC assessment department officials. Sources said the KMC top brass were worried over the slow progress. “Whatever has been done so far is not enough to accommodate every tax payer in the UAA scheme. We need to keep up a certain pace so that we can wrap up the process in time,” an official said.
