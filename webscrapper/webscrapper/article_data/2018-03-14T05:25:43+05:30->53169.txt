 Additional judges are appointed for a two-year tenure and then based on their performances these judges are made permanent. As on March 1, 2018, the 24 high courts in the country had a working strength of 673 judges with 406 positions vacant. The total sanctioned strength is 1,079 judges. The high courts have long pendency of cases, and among other reasons, the large number of vacancies of judges is also contributing to delay in disposal of cases.
