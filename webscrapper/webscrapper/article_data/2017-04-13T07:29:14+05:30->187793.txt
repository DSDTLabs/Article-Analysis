JAIPUR : Employees at the   ( ) have started protesting against the decision of setting up a bio-metric machine for attendance. 

 Many claim, majority of employees are posted in the fields and coming to office from far-slung area for marking attendance on scheduled time is not feasible. The decision was taken after mayor conducted a sudden inspection and found 85% of the staff is not available on seat.
 
 On Wednesday, the JMC union met additional commissioner,   requesting not to launch biometric system. The union leaders claimed , “JMC employees are already working for extra hours. The administration wants us to work like bonded labourers this would effect the performance.” 
 
 The union threaten Meena that they will continue to mark attendance in the registers. The JMC administration has decided to start the new system from April 17th. Meena told protesters that new system is being introduced on Mayor’s direction. 
 
 Having failed to enforce staff attendance over many years, the JMC had earlier installed biometric attendance machines across its zonal offices and its head office at   in 2011.
 
 Following this , officials reportedly came to office on time . However, as administration failed to upkeep and maintain the machines, the officials again started coming late to office. Now, there is no improvement in the JMC’s functioning as it is difficult for administration to detect late comers. “In 2011, after the biometric system was put in place at the JMC's head office at Lal Kothi, the all employees were asked to record attendance twice a day, including the CEO, deputy mayor's staff and all zonal commissioners. This has improved the system,” source said.
