VIJAYAWADA: The Krishna district administration has moved a step ahead in launching the   metro rail project by issuing preliminary land acquisition notifications to acquire necessary land. Notifications were issued for acquiring about 70 acres in and around the city for both the corridors of the metro project.

 A total of 11 preliminary notifications for land at Enikepadu, Gunadala, Kanuru, Machavaram, Mogalrajpuram, Nidamanuru, Prasadampadu, Patamata, Poranki, Vijayawada urban mandal and Vijayawada rural mandal were drafted by the district administration. While the ones pertaining to   and Vijayawada urban areas were issued on Tuesday , the others are set to be issued on Wednesday .
 
 District collector B   said in the notifications that 60 days' time will be given for the project-affected families to raise their objections, if any , and added that revenue officials will conduct a survey within 60 days of the issue of notification. However, most of these notifications have glaring factual errors.
 
 “The owners of the land are told to be present in person or through authorised representative while conducting the survey , failing which the survey would be conducted in their absence,“ the notifications said.
