Guntur: A differently abled man committed suicide allegedly after he was tortured by the police at Konduru village in Acchempet mandal at Guntur district on Friday. 

 Balaiah (35) had polio and was 75% disabled. He was accused of stealing ten chickens and was summoned to the police station every day for the last 17 days.
 
 Balaiah hanged himself at his house on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. Family members and locals alleged that he took the extreme step because of the police harassment. They also alleged that he was falsely framed by the police in the case and tortured to force him to confess to the crime. They questioned that how can a man who cannot even stand steal chickens?
 
 Sources from the village said that there was a long-standing dispute between two castes, which have been rallying behind the two main parties, was the reason behind the latest feud. Allegedly, the caste that was with the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) accused Balaiah of stealing chickens and a case was booked against him following a complaint from village president Bhageswar Rao. The other caste rallying behind the opposition YSRC allege, the case was politically motivated. They alleged that even the local sub-inspector Kiran acted in a biased manner. As the torture by cops continued for 17 days, Balaiah ended life, they alleged.
 
 Balaiahâ€™s family staged protest in the village with the dead body, raising slogans against police and local TDP leaders.
 
  Sattenapalle DSP, Kalesha Vali, rushed to the spot and held talks with the agitating family members. He assured that action would be taken against the erring officers .
