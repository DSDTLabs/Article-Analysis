GHAZIABAD: Two functionaries of ruling   –Rashid Malik and Ummed Ali– were detained following an alleged   on Sunday.

 Malik and Ali could not submit proof of the permission from authorities for organising a roadshow in Loni, as per the FIR filed at Tronica City police station. The cops also said that the organisers of roadshow violated the code of conduct by illegally using sirens and hooters on vehicles. 
 
 Both the leaders were taken to Tronica City police station along with their followers. They were released after submitting Rs 5 lakh surety bond each. Earlier, dozens of supporters reached Loni to participate in the roadshow. The district administration, however, intervened when the huge rally choked the traffic in the area.
 
 “The roadshow was taken out even though we warned them against it over the phone. We reached the spot and seized their vehicles. Traffic was cleared and the participants were taken into custody. Both Malik and Ali were let to go after three hours on submitting personal surety bonds,” SDM (Loni) Prem Ranjan Singh said. 
 
 The case has been registered under sections 171 (fraudulently carrying token used by public servant) and 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant) of the IPC.
 
 Malik, however, told TOI that he had obtained the requisite permission from the district authorities. “I had the requisite permission. But we were allowed to include no more than 100 vehicles in the rally. A few more supporters later joined,” he said.
