MANGALURU: Mangalore University has given wings to a two-year-old idea to start a department of law on its Mangalagangothri campus. This idea took a concrete shape in the budget estimate for 2018-19 that finance officer   presented at the fourth general meeting of the academic council of the university on Saturday. The university has set aside Rs 80 lakh under its priority projects list to start a five-year   that students can join after completing their PU.

 VC   said once the process to start the integrated course is complete, the university will add the law department on its PG campus here. Hitherto, law colleges in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kodagu that were affiliated to the university, offered law courses with senior-most faculty members from these colleges functioning as law deans. These colleges then got affiliated to the Karnataka State Law University, 8-years ago.
 
 The move to start a law department on lines with the education department started recently, after Byrappa took charge as VC, and has been doing the rounds for the past two years. Incidentally, Byrappa is inclined to appoint Dayanand Naik as the coordinator, to complete the process, which includes getting permission from the Bar Council of India, so that the university can start the department at the earliest. “We want to start it from next academic year,” the VC said.
 
 Officials in university privy to the development said the university does not need permission from KSLU to start the integrated law course, which other colleges wanting to do so, need. “We have the example of University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bengaluru that is affiliated to Bangalore University and not to VTU,” the official said, adding the department could initially start under the arts or education faculty, before shifting to its own faculty with a dean.
