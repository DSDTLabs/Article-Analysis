BENGALURU: Despite intervention by national president   in the ongoing tussle between legislative council opposition leader   and state party president B S Yeddyurappa, the issue reportedly continues to rankle within party forums. 

  A   source claimed that a meeting was convened by Eshwarappa with his supporters on Tuesday night, on the   and office bearer changes as sought by him and his camp at the meeting with Shah. It is learnt that the state unit was to form a committee with Eshwarappa, Yeddyurappa, BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao and party organization secretary B L Santosh to discuss changes in the office bearers of the party before preparing a report and sending it to Shah by February 10. 
 
 However, the committee is yet to be formed. At the meeting, Eshwarappa is learnt to have spoken once again about changing the office bearers, who were appointed by Yeddyurappa after he took charge of the party. 
 
 However, sources in the Yeddyurappa camp said both Rao and Yeddyurappa were held up in Parliament and it was conveyed that the matter will be discussed at the party core committee meeting on February 13.
