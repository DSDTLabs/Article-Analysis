 "We both have started our respective careers together so there hasn't been discussion about money and it will never be in the future as well. I just want to clarify that there is nothing wrong between me and Luv sir. I think we both are same as we used to be earlier."
 
 There have been reports that Kartik will be working with   in a Dharma Productions film.
 
 Asked about it, he said, "Whenever the producer or director of the film will make an announcement of the film, only then will I be able to comment on that. Now is not the right to speak what I am doing next.
 
 "So, I am waiting for the official announcement of my upcoming films from producers or director. Having said that, if I get an opportunity to work with Kareena, I would love to work with her. She is one of my favourite actresses."
