AHMEDABAD: It may be the darkest night of the month, but for seekers of Shiva, the night cannot get any better. While Shivratri is observed on the 14th night of the waning moon,  , observed every year in the ‘Maha’ month of the Hindu calendar (February-March), is considered to be the supreme due to its spiritual significance. While there are many legends associated with the festival, for devotees, it is the occasion to be with the divine.

  Various prominent temples in the city have geared up for the occasion. Most of the temples will perform char prahar puja starting from late evening to the early hours of the next day.
 
 Officials at   temple said that apart from the elaborate maha puja, there would also be kamal puja where 501 lotuses would be offered to the deity ceremonially. “The morning hours will see havan (ritualistic offering to the fire), whereas from the evening hours, the elaborate rituals would take place,” said an official. 
 
 Mahendra Ramsnehi, pujari at Samartheshwar Mahadev temple near Law Garden, said that the night holds significance as the one where the devotees feel closeness to the supreme being. “For centuries, the festival hails the Aadi Yogi for his teachings to the world. Apart from offerings, there will be a dance performance at the temple during the day,” he said.
 
 Chakudiya Mahadev temple at   will have a multi-feet high lingam at its premises covered in   beads to mark the occasion.
