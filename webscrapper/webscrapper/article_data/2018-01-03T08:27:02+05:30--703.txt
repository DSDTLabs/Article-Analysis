PATIALA: The   police have booked five cops after custodial death of a 70-year-old man in   on Tuesday afternoon.

 The deceased, identified as   Singh, from   village of the district, was rounded up by the police on Tuesday in a case related to drugs. He died in custody after which his protesting family members blocked a highway and pelted stones on the police, demanding action against the erring cops.
 
 The deceased had been brought to Ghagga police station for inquiry in a case related to drugs after a police team raided his house and nabbed him.
 
 Harnek’s family claimed three head constables in a police jeep and two constables on a motorcycle had taken part in the raid on his residence. The protesters alleged Harnek was tortured in police custody, which led to his death. However, the police claimed that Harnek had died due to a heart attack and denied he had been tortured.
 
 The situation became tense when the protesters blocked the   highway (NH-7) and demanded arrest of the cops linked to Harnek’s death. At around 7 pm, the protesters also pelted stones on the cops and overturned a police jeep in anger, but no one was injured.
 
 SP (detective) H S   told TOI Harnek’s death was “highly unfortunate,” but insisted it was a natural death caused by a heart attack. He admitted technically it could be described as a custodial death as Harnek died in police custody.
 
 Virk claimed the deceased was not tortured. “Initially, we marked an inquiry, but now we have booked three cops in this case by name and two other cops, who are yet unidentified, on murder charges. The exact reason of the death would be known only after post-mortem report is finalized,” he added.
