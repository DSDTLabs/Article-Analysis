Acting powerhouse   is all praise for young actors   and   for their roles as Gemini Ganeshan and   in the Telugu movie  . Prakash Raj plays producer Chakrapani in the movie, which is a Telugu biopic of Savithri and is directed by Nag Ashwin.

 
 Prakash Raj, who is in Kerala shooting for a Mohanlal-starrer, tells us, “Mahanati is an interesting biopic; a good assessment, at this point of time, of the magic and mystery of who Savithri was. I like actors who are trying to metamorphosise themselves, trying to get to know what cinema was back then, the thought processes of the people, what relationships meant then, what their personal choices were and the roles they played. It’s commendable for actors like Dulquer and Keerthy to take up these roles.”
 
 Mahanati, which will be released in Tamil as Nadigaiyar Thilagam, is set to hit theatres on May 9. It also has Samantha and Vijay Devarakonda in supporting roles.
