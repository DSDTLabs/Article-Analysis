CHITRADURGA: Political handlers of energy minister D K Shiva Kumar have been projecting him as the front-runner for the chief minister's post in the 2018 assembly polls. But he sprang a surprise on Saturday by stating that incumbent   should be made the CM again. 

 At the Janarige Manana-Janarige Namana event organised here to mark the completion of the fourth year in office by the Siddaramaiah government, Kumar said: "The   should be brought back to power in the coming assembly elections under Siddaramaiah's leadership and he should be made the CM." His public support for the CM triggered speculation as it comes two days after the latter stopped projecting himself as the party's chief ministerial candidate and left it to the discretion of the high command to decide the next CM if the party comes to power. 
 
 Congress sources maintained that Kumar’s stand is linked to the backroom operations in the party with regard to the appointment of the new KPCC president. With AICC general secretary K C Venugopal stating that the high command will announce the new KPCC president by the month-end, lobbying has begun for the post. While Siddaramaiah has been favouring a Lingayat from his camp, the demand for making a dalit the president has been growing stronger. There have been reports that Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun M Kharge will be sent back to Karnataka to prepare the party for polls. 
 
 But what changed political dynamics in the Congress is a media leak on Saturday on the caste census. The reports said dalits form the largest community in the state with 1.48 crore (Scheduled Castes - 1.08 crore and Scheduled Tribes - 40.45 lakh) and followed by Muslims (70 lakh), Lingayats (65 lakh), Vokkaligas (60 lakh), Kurubas (45 lakh) and other backward classes (95 lakh). The Congress has to either appoint a dalit or a candidate backed by Siddaramaiah, who enjoys the support of Muslims and backward classes, as the KPCC chief. “The caste census report will narrow Kumar’s chances of becoming the party chief and the best option before him is to rally behind Siddaramaiah,” sources said. 
 
 In fact, Kumar defended Siddaramaiah's achievements and took potshots at BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa for trying to malign the government. “All that BJP leaders did while in power was to go to jail and come out on bail. Barring the distribution of bicycles and saris, Yeddyurappa did nothing memorable while in power," he added.
