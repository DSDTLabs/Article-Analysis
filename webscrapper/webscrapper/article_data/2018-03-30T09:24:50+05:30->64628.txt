CHENNAI: Big companies and traders in the state are ready to roll out the e-way bill as part of the goods and services taxes system on April 1.   sources told TOI that two months ago the department allowed big companies whose products go to other states to use the GSTN e-way software in a bid to prepare themselves for the rollout.

 Many manufacturing companies dispatch their products to various parts of Tamil Nadu and other states as well. “From coming Sunday, all trucks and vehicles carrying goods will have to carry   while crossing  ,” said a senior official in the commercial taxes department.
 
 The bar-coded bills will have details about the product in the vehicle and the GST paid for it. “There are no commercial taxes check posts at state borders after the GST was introduced in July last year. At present, trucks and other commercial vehicles cross state borders without waiting for days for clearance. With the bar-coded bills, it will be easier for trucks to move from state to state,” he said.
 
 In case an enforcement officer wants to check a vehicle, using the bar-coded bill he will be able to download all details about the vehicle, cargo and GST payment. “The enforcement officer can access all details using just a mobile phone,” the official said.
