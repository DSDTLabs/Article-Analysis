Chandigarh: Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher was ‘misguided’ by her staff to join Haryana student association (HSA) parties’ recent student council winning procession after they won elections in DAV College of Sector 10, Chandigarh mayor Asha Jaswal shared with Punjab University (PU) students on Friday. 

 In an interaction programme with the mayor at student centre of PU, ABVP supporters raised the issue of senior party leaders like Kirron Kher joining HSA parties’ winning processions after they won elections in DAV college and said they were disheartened by this. In fact, an associate of Kher Sehdev Salaria also supported the opponent party in GGDSD college of Sector 32 in student council elections which is objectionable, they said.
 
 When the city mayor proposed that BJP has to come forward to support their student wing ABVP in student council elections next year, a student of PU asked why they never came to PU to support their student wing till date.
 
 Reacting to the issue of rape case of the student of government school of Sector 23, mayor said a year ago during her inspection of the school, she pointed out to the school management that the back-door facilitating students to bunk their classes should be shut. But nothing was done till the incident took place near the school.
 
 Mayor gave a message to the students to say no to drugs. She said during their party campaign they should guide students not to indulge in drugs and other addictions.
 
 “The campaign for the party should go on for the whole year rather than just 15 days before elections,” she told the ABVP supporters in interaction.
 
 PU nostalgia
 
 Recalling her student days in PU, mayor said law department boys created fear among girls in the campus during those days. She even mentioned that she used visit the campus to have masala dosa even after her student days over in 1977
