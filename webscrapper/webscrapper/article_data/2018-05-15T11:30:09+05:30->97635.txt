 Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has reported that the current level at the Wazirabad pond stands at 671.9ft against the normal 674.5ft. “Due to the reduction of flow of raw water, the production of water treatment plants at Haiderpur, Dwarka, Nangloi, Bawana, Wazirabad, Okhla and Chadrawal have been affected,” a senior official said.
 
 DJB will now rationalise the supply by diverting water from less impacted water treatment plants (WTPs) to more severely impacted   and Chandrawal WTPs and water will be available at low pressure for coming days.
 
 After a prolonged crisis in the first three months this year, DJB had approached both NGT and the Supreme Court to force Haryana to release water. Haryana had assured Delhi that the supply would be maintained till May 15.
