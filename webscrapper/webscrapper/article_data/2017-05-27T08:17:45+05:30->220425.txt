HYDERABAD: Construction waste strewn across the city is not only an eyesore but a serious health hazard, experts said. Despite plans that have been pending for a long time, the city is yet to get its first debris recycling plant.

 On an average, the   ( ) receives 25 calls every month regarding unattended debris. Debris was spotted on Friday at Kukatpally, Borabanda, Balanagar, Edi Bazar and on the newly-constructed road connecting   to Kishanbagh.
 
 “Construction debris is a serious threat to commuters as whenever there is slight wind it scatters all over the road and makes it difficult to drive. As I travel on a bike, I always fear skidding due to the gravel on the road,” said  , a commuter who travels from Puranapul to Kishanbagh regularly. 
 
 The particulate matter released from debris can turn out to be hazardous if a person is exposed to it on regular basis, according to doctors. “Studies have proven that particulate matter released from debris not only affects the lungs but also the heart,” said M Srinivas Rao, a senior doctor from Care Hospitals. “People with respiratory disorders are affected the most,” he added.
 
 The GHMC is also to blame as it is still to identify dumping spots for construction waste. Currently, the GHMC disposes debris at a cost of Rs 360 per tonne. “Some builders and individuals do not opt for their services and instead throw it on some roadside,” a resident said. 
 
 On an average, the city generates between 500 to 800 metric tonnes of debris, according to officials at the solid waste management and transport department of GHMC.
