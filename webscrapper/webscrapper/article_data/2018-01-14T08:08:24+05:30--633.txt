LUDHIANA: In one of the biggest drug hauls in the past decade, the Ludhiana (Rural) police seized 2,975 kg of poppy husk at Sherpur Kalan village in Jagraon. But two cousins and their accomplices who were smuggling the same on a tractor trolley gave police the slip.

 The peddlers were identified as Harmail Singh of Hathoor village and   of Sidhwan College area.
 
 Inspector general of police (Jalandhar zone) Arpit Shukla and deputy inspector general of police (Ludhiana range)   said acting on the directions of SSP (Ludhiana rural)   as part of the campaign against drugs, Sadar SHO Jagjeet Singh set up a check post at Sherpur Kalan village on Friday. They added that the police team saw a blue-coloured tractor coming from the village side.
 
 Police officers said on seeing the police party, the tractor driver, his cousin and two others abandoned the vehicle and ran away towards the fields. But, assistant sub-inspector (ASI)  , police post incharge   and head constable   identified the accused as they knew them previously.
 
 “On searching the tractor trolley, police party found 85 bags of poppy husk with each bag weighing around 35kg. Later, the accused was booked under various sections of the NDPS Act at   police station. Two unidentified persons have also been named in the case,” said SSP (Ludhiana Rural) Surjeet Singh.
 
 He said police will come to know about the source of the consignment after the accused are arrested. The SSP said raids are being conducted to nab the accused.
