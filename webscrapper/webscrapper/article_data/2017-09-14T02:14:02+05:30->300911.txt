GREATER NOIDA: A 22-year-old BA student from Manipur, who had arrived in Greater Noida to attend a music concert by the international artists  , on September 8, has gone missing. His family members have filed a missing person’s complaint at Knowledge Park police station.

 Family members said   had arrived in Delhi on September 7 and stayed the night at his friend’s place.  , his elder brother, said Pravish was to attend the concert in Greater Noida’s Expo Mart the following day. “He went to the concert in the morning with a group of 20 friends. While the other group members were busy in the concert, he apparently strayed away and went missing in the evening,” he said. The group members later launched a search, but failed to trace him. Next day, the family filed a police complaint.
 
 Suniti, SP (rural),  , said police investigated the CCTV footage from the entry gate of the venue, which showed Pravish going out with a woman. The police scanned the campus as well as the neighbouring areas, but could not find him.
 
 Police said Pravish and other group members had deposited their mobile phones and purses to one friend during the concert. “It also came to light that the youth was drunk when he went missing. Since his mobile phone is not with him, the electronic surveillance is not yielding much help,” said a police official.
 
 On Wednesday, police received information from a private hospital in Noida that a patient named Pravish Chanam had visited there for treatment of some ailment. “The patient was later discharged. We have sent a police team to get more information about this person. We believe this is the same missing student. We will be able to trace him soon,” Suniti said. The police have alerted officials of different police stations and have launched a search.
 
 Meanwhile, Pravish’s family and friends have launched a campaign on social networking sites to trace him.
