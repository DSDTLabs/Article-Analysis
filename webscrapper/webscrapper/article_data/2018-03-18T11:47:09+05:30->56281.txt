Director  , who is awaiting the release of his project 'Daas Dev', said he doesn't want just bankable faces but wants 'actors' in his films.
 
  
 "I just want actors. They are a bit layered... it is not that stars cannot be actors, there are stars who can be good actors. Like, sometimes actors become stars," Mishra told media.
 
 "Now, the problem is, nobody is saying so, and including women in the media are not saying that actress   is a star. But she is. She has just done a Rs 80 crore film! Had any boy done a Rs 80 crore film, they would have called him a star. But yeah, I always try and choose actors," he added.
 
 Mishra, who is known for directing critically acclaimed films like 'Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi', 'Dharavi' and 'Chameli', also cited the example of actress  , whose performance in 'Chameli' was lauded by film critics.
