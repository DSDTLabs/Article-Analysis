GUWAHATI: Taking cognizance of increasing instances of traffic jam and pollution in the city,   ( ) has asked all the warehouses and truck parking facilities located in the vicinity of national highway 37 to shift within a period of six months.

 "With the city expanding towards the highway, all these unabated constructions are causing pollution and traffic congestion along the entire stretch of the national highway. So, all such warehouses, and facilities for truck parking and coal stacking have been asked to shift to locations outside the new Guwahati metropolitan area," said CEO of GMDA M Angamuthu.
 
 A large number of warehouses, truck parking yards and facilities for stacking coals are located alongside the national highway from Jalukbari to Khanapara, while several others are also being constructed. These facilities are a constant threat to the local ecosystem and also crucial water bodies like the Deepor Beel.
 
 Citizens have welcomed the decision decision to shift all these establishments. "The traffic makes it difficult for people who are travelling outside the city, either to the airport or to other places," said Pranjal Hazarika, a resident of the area.
