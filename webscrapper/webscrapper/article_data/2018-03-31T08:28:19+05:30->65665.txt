 Investigation officer of the case, ASP (STF)   said that Aptech had conducted the exam by forming a three-tier system, the first being the authoring team which prepared questions along with the answer key and send them to the infra team. The first team did not have a plan-B and there was no spare set of questions in case of a leak. 
 
 The infra team had to upload the questions in a software and then transfer it from servers to the centres.
 
 The company had assured that the questions are locked with a by password and will get decrypted only at the time of exam, and no software can breach it. However, remote access control compromised the data. 
 
 In the third tier was the local centre team which had to oversee the centres where exam was to be conducted. This team never paid a visit to the centres. The logging PIN of the computers where the candidates had to take exam was also distributed in advance, said Singh.
 
 SSP (STF)   said, "We are hunting for more intermediaries and solvers in connection with the paper leak. A team has been formed and hunt is under way. The STF said that a detailed report about the lapses in the examination is being prepared and will be sent to the home department for further action.
