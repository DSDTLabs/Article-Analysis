AHMEDABAD: Some class X students of the   Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board have found the mathematics examination tough. These students said that questions worth at least 15 marks were tricky. 

 Sloka Patel, a student, said: “After preparations, I was targeting more than 90 marks; I expect to get between 70 and 80 marks.” She said that over the past five years, the paper had been based on problems in the textbook. It wasn’t the case this year, she said. 
 
 Board officials, however, said that a review of the paper revealed that it was not tough. The officials said that the board has not received any complaint. M M Pathan, the officer on special duty, said: “The questions were drawn from the syllabus but students were required to apply their mind. We did not replicate the numbers from the textbook. That may have confused some students.”   students who studied the NCERT syllabus as part of a pilot project in 56 schools found the paper easy.
 
 Sixteen cheating cases were reported from the state. In Ahmedabad, one case was reported from Vidhan School in Isanpur. The student was caught cheating by a supervisor. Four cases were reported from Panchamahals, three each from Patan and Vadodara , two from Bharuch, and one each from Kheda, Kutch, and Porbandar.
