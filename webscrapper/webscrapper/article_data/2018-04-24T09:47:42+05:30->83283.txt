BHOPAL: MP home minister   believes pornography is the “main cause” for rapes in the state and has written to the Centre on Monday to ban access to all  .

 
 The   government in   has blocked 25 porn sites but that’s not enough and pornography should be banned altogether, said Singh.
 
 “A study by the MP home department revealed pornography is adversely impacting childhood, with even young boys and girls getting easy access to it. Rapes and sexual assaults are a result of access to these sites,” Singh told reporters at the secretariat. However, he did not disclose details of the study conducted by his department. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 MP home minister said, “Though some 25 porn sites have been banned, we do not have direct control over such sites. So, we have urged the Union government to ban all porn sites and introduce a stringent law to control porn.”
 
 Singh lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to enact a law to award capital punishment to those convicted of raping girls aged 12 and below. He said the MP government had approved a bill in November 2017 and Prime Minister has “taken a big decision by clearing the proposal”. “Chief minister   had taken the initiative by moving an ordinance in the state assembly for capital punishment to those convicted of raping girls below 12 years of age. The central government has now approved it. PM Modi has given a tough law to the country against rape,” he said.
 
 The home minister, however, agreed that stricter laws won’t be a solution until social awareness is created through mass campaigns.
