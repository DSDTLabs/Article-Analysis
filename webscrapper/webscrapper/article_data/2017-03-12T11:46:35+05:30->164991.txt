By all accounts, PM   is against handing out dole. Since his government took over in May 2014, the Centre has tried to improve the quality of spending and target subsidies at those who really need it.

 But the verdict in UP -especially in the wake of demonetisation, which was seen as a pro-poor move -may prompt the Centre to loosen its purse strings in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Demonetisation has raised expectations that the poor and the not-so-well off will be rewarded.
 
 Modi's “package“ post demonetisation, through schemes such as subsidised home loans, too, was aimed at the so-called weaker sections -from farmers, to small businesses, senior citizens and the neo-middle class. In fact, Modi has used subsidised interest rates across the board as he rode piggyback on ailing public sector banks to push loans and financial products through no-frills bank accounts. “Nationalisation of banks was a big move, but it was Modiji who made it possible for the poor to have accounts in those banks,“ BJP chief   said at a presser. So far, the Centre under BJP has stuck to the fiscal deficit target, which investors see as a key measure of financial health, but with polls two years away, there will be pressure to spend on “priority sectors“, said economists. 
 
 But some of BJP's promises in   seem to go against the way policies have been tailored at the Centre during the near three years of Modi's tenure. A key promise is to provide interestfree loans and interest waiver to small and marginal farmers. How much it will cost is not known yet.
