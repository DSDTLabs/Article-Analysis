COIMBATORE: As many as 136   in the district were not paid their salary for the past two months, as the forest department is yet to receive funds for the same. But this hasn’t deterred them from carrying out their duties.

 
 “We weren’t paid for two months. Yet, we are closely monitoring the movement of leopards and wild elephants in residential areas at   forest range round the clock,” said an anti-poaching watcher, who didn’t want to be named.
 
 These anti-poaching watchers are mostly tribals, who have sound knowledge of the forest and animal behaviour. Recruited by the forest department on a temporary basis more than 10 years ago to prevent poaching in reserve forests areas, these anti-poaching watchers were initially paid Rs 2,314 a month. The salary was hiked to Rs 4,000 in 2007-08 and then to Rs 6,750 in 2015. Last year, their salary was again revised to Rs 10,000.
 
 Another anti-poaching watcher told TOI that many of them had to work round-the-clock to prevent man-animal conflicts. “Most of us shell out anywhere between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000 as house rent a month. It is difficult to make both ends meet with the remaining amount. We risk our lives while chasing away wild animals into reserve forests. We want the government to increase the salary as well,” he added.
 
 According to official sources, the forest department used to pay the anti-poaching watchers from the proceeds of eco-tourism initiatives at   in   forest range and Baralikadu in   forest range. “Since the government increased their salary last year, the money earned from eco-tourism activities isn’t enough to pay their salary. Hence, we are waiting for the budget allocation from the state government,” said a senior official.
 
 Venkatesh, district forest officer, Coimbatore forest division, told TOI that anti-poaching watchers would be paid their salary within two days. “All the necessary steps have been taken to issue the salary immediately,” he said.
