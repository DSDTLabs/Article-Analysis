LAMBI/MUKSAR: With five days to go for campaigning to end for February 4 polls,   (AAP) supremo   on the   as he made a fresh announcement to re-open any   against the heads of these parties in the state following a win on March 11.

 “Till now the FIRs are getting registered against common man in Punjab. When we come to power, both Capt Amarinder and Badal family members would face police cases for their misdeeds,“ said Kejriwal. The Delhi CM made this announcement while touring villages in Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal's constituency Lambi.
 
 While the state vigilance bureau (VB) had in September given a clean-chit to Punjab Congress chief and former CM Capt Amarinder Singh in a 10-year old Amritsar Improvement Trust bribery case, the police had not interrogated any sitting minister or MLA from SAD in Rs 6,000-crore synthetic drug case. The challans in both cases have been submitted by the Special Investigation Team (SITs) in various courts.
 
 The poll battle in Lambi is being looked by many as a hot seat after Kejriwal had announced to field its Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh against CM Badal followed by Congress chief Amarinder's announcement to also contest from here.
 
 Kejriwal also took potshots at both Amarinder and Badal, saying, “Both of them are saying it's their last election, then how will they fulfill their election promises.“
 
 He reiterated his charge of collusion between Amarin of collusion between Amarinder and Badal families, saying that they were helping each other to safeguard their seats. “Why else would Capt saab come to Lambi at the last minute when Jarnail's popularity was soaring. He wants to cut into his votes. Similarly, SAD has fielded a weak candidate in Gen JJ Singh to ensure Capt wins in Patiala,“ said Kejriwal.
