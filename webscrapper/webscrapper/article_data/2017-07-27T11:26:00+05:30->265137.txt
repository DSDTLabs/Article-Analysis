GANDHINAGAR: Now it’s almost clear that the state BJP and Congress are getting ready for a big legal fight over the Rajya Sabha seat for which Ahmed Patel is in fray. Patel, who is political secretary of Congress president  .

 Eleven Congress MLAs had cross-voted in the recent presidential elections. Now, the BJP is trying to cause maximum cross-voting by Congress MLAs in the Rajya Sabha elections in which Patel is contesting on one seat. 
 
 If around 20 Congress MLAs cross-vote, Patel can lose the seat after 24 years. On Tuesday, the Congress issued a written whip to all its MLAs. The whip quotes the provision and the rules of the Representation of the People Act (RPA) and says that anyone who cross-votes can be disqualified from contesting any election for six years. However, the BJP claims that no one can be barred from contesting elections on the ground of cross-voting.
 
 Shaktisinh Gohil, national spokesperson and senior  , said, "According to the amendment made in 2003 by Parliament and the rules framed under it in the Representation of the People Act (RPA), anyone who cross-votes against their party’s mandate will automatically be considered disqualified from contesting any election for six years as cross-voting is violation of people’s mandate."
 
 However,   minister of state (home, law & parliamentary affairs) Pradipsinh Jadeja claimed that they had come to know that that Congress is trying to mislead its MLAs and wrongfully threatening them with disqualification from contesting any election. 
 
 "The Election Commission of India has also clarified on the issue that cross-voting can not be considered reason for disqualification from contesting elections. Moreover there are court judgements in this regard also. Congress, who is losing people’s mandate, now fears its own MLAs," Jadeja said.
