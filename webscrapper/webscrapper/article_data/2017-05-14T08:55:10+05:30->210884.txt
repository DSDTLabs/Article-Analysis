HYDERABAD: Though the   from various reservoirs will continue almost round-the-clock as part of the `40,000 crore  , a   of chief minister  , its   to the households will be regulated.

 It will not be 24x7 water supply for the first few months.Though the overhead service reservoirs (OHSRs) in every village will be brimming with water all the time, the supply to the households through taps would be only during scheduled timings. The state government wants to first create awareness about the importance of the precious commodity , propagate its storage methods and other usages before taking a de cision on the date of extending 24-hour supply . The idea is to ensure that water is not wasted.
 
 Officials said the crucial phase of installation as well as commissioning of nearly 1200 motors at various intake wells, treatment plants, overhead balancing reservoirs to pump water is all set to commence by the month end or the first week of June.
 
 Power supply to the pumping stations is being planned in such a way that if the supply trips from one source, the system will automatically tap from another sub-station ensuring uninterrupted power supply and pumping of water. “There will be two to three or even more sets of motors at every pumping station. If one set of motors run for the first 6 to 8 hours, another set will function for the next 6 to 8 hours and third for the remaining hours. This way , we will ensure 22-hour pumping with two hour cushion period,“ the official said.
 
 As much as 180 mw of power will be required to pump water from various sources as part of Mission Bhagiratha project. To begin with, the raw water will be pumped from intake wells at reservoirs (source) and then treated at treatment plants before being supplied to OHSRs.
