 An 11-member delegation has called on the governor at his residence to direct the state government that until the film producer gives an undertaking of not distorting any historic fact, the film shouldn’t be allowed shooting in Rajasthan.

 Suresh Mishra of Brahmin Mahasabha says that they had asked some questions to the film producer Kamal Jain which unfortunately he has yet to respond has provoked us to knock the governor house.
 
 “Almost 10 days ago, the producer was asked to clear that is upcoming movie based on any book? Where they have got the story from? How many songs they have in the movie and how they will showcase? But the producer has not responded till date. It clears that they are distorting history which is not acceptable to the community,” said Mishra.
 
 The Mahasabha in their memorandum to the governor has asked the office and state to intervene by directing the film producers and directors to make sure that they are not playing with the sentiments of the people.
 
 “The manner in which state responded in the case of controversial movie Padmaavat by banning in the state keeping the sentiments of people, we expect them to take appropriate action in the beginning so that situation cannot go to the extent that people will come on the roads,” said Mishra.
 
 The Mahasabha has held state government responsible if any untoward happens. “In case the community will not get any response from the state or the film makers, we will go to any extent to stop the shooting of the film,” cautioned Mishra to the state and to the film crew.
