 The   administration had cited “orders from the high court” and opposed the event organised by  , claiming that no protests, dharnas or sit-ins are allowed within 100 metres of the admin block. The university even released a notice advising students to “refrain from organising any event that is in violation of the rules, regulations and relevant court orders”. 
 
 Yadav confirmed having received a letter from the registrar. “But I came here because the   issue is important for us...I am here to speak within the purview of law,” the MP said. 
 
 Yadav called the UGC order “unjust and discriminatory” and praised the students’ agitation. He also criticised JNU and called for an increase in the number of seats. 
 
 JNU has promised disciplinary action, but the registrar was not available for comments.
