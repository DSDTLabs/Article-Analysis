Thankfully, Mukesh comes to the rescue with Tamil wordings that fall under the thathuvam category. With repetitive beats, this so-called kuthu number can almost give you a headache. Thangachiye is a sad track that talks about losing a sibling. Itâ€™s been a while Kollywood has had a song on sisters. The composer, Paartav Barggo has sung this melancholic song, which is average. The flute and keyboard bits towards the end of the song are well done, though. There is also a revenge premise of the same song, that begins with fast-paced beats and is high on energy. This rock-inspired track has extensive guitar and drum portions and is again sung by the composer himself. The interludes feature a chanting bit that gels well with the track. The lyrics by Na Muthukumar focus on how to fight a battle and win over it. 
 
 Singari Chennakari, an item number, begins with done-to-death beats and lyrics that are unimpressive. Sung by Surmukhi, you can give this one a miss.  , the sole romantic number in the album, begins with chorus portions that stand out. Anuradha Sriram croons this number with ease and brings variation to the track with her voice modulation.   steps up for the male portions and does justice to his parts. The composer has used the flute and violin effectively. Finally, there is Yeidhavan Theme, that is high on energy, guitars, dialogues and all things expected in a theme number. This album fails to make a mark.
