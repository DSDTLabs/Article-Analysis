JAIPUR: The urban development and housing (UDH) minister   is likely to be summoned by the   ( ), New Delhi, for violating the model code of conduct.

 The notices were issued after   alleged that the minister exhibited scant regard for an institution like EC. The violation took place last month in state capital where the UDH minister just after the announcement of bypolls dates in three districts called a press conference and released a statement which states that state government would issue lease deeds in all the districts where regularisation process is stalled for long. 
 
 The announcement was considered as populist move, with an eye on the by poll on January 29.
 
 An official at EC said, “The New Delhi office issued notices to the minister seeking explanation.”
 
 Sources in the department said, the minister did not reply in first notice. Similarly, reply of second notice was provided by the additional chief secretary, UDH. “The EC issues two notices to the violators. In case, the explanation is not given on both the notices, action is taken,” added source.
 
 It was further informed, “The ministry in its reply has mentioned that press conference was called to share the information and there was no violation of code of conduct.” 
 
 A recent survey, conducted by the JDA for state capital had revealed that around 1,200 colonies developed by housing cooperative societies in the city could not be regularised.
 
 There are nearly 210-225 colonies that fall in the ecological zone as per the city’s Master Plan-2025. Majority of these colonies are situated on the Jaipur-Agra road. In the latest city master plan, the ecological zone was increased in comparison with the previous plan. This has now become a major hurdle for the JDA while regularizing these colonies.
