KOCHI: Various unions working under Centre of   (CITU) and the district   will set up over two lakh rainwater pits in the district as part of   in Kochi. 

 C Ratheesh, a member of CITU, said the two-day initiative that began on Saturday was aimed at increasing public participation in conservation of water. Over 50,000 rainwater pits will be constructed by the groups under CITU.
 
 "We are encouraging the construction of rainwater pits in all compounds owner by members as well as others who are willing to participate in the initiative," said CPM district secretary P Rajevee.
 
 CITU district secretary   said: "The programme will not only help combat water crisis, but also improve the groundwater levels. It will replenish natural drinking water sources like ponds and wells."
 
 However, environmentalists are of the view that the construction of rainwater pits rampantly will do more harm. "When such a large number of rainwater pits are constructed in such a short span of time, there are higher chances of accidents if necessary precautionary measures are not taken while constructing them. If these pits are not marked and fenced properly, people may easily fall into them and even drown," said Sitaraman S, an environmentalist.
 
 He added that it was better to rely on well-recharging methods and construction of rainwater pits near wells, if water conservation was the aim as it was a sustainable method of rainwater management.
