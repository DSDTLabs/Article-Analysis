GURUGRAM: If all goes according to plan, malaria will be eradicated from Gurugram in the next three years. The state   says its is working round the clock to bring an end to the vector-borne viral disease by 2020. 

 This is well in keeping with the Union government’s aim is to make the country free from malaria by 2030.
 
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set a global target of 2030 to end malaria. Every year, 30 crore people across the world suffer from malaria. Setting the same aim as  , the Union government has also declared 2030 as the target year for India to be  . It has divided states in the country in three categories based on the incidences of malaria. 
 
 District malaria officer Dr SS Saroha told TOI that 38 cases of malaria and 86 cases of dengue were reported in   last year. 
 
 According to the annual parasitic incidence, Gurgaon has 0.02 cases per 1,000 people, while, Haryana records 0.06 cases per 1,000 people.
 
 “Haryana is category 1 state, which means our annual parasitic incidence is currently less than 1, and it has it be brought down to zero. We aim to achieve the target by 2020,” said Dr Saroha.
 
 The state health department has drawn up a roadmap to achieve its target. All the districts have been issued clear instructions to start working on the plan. Gurgaon too has begun working on this mission.
 
 A six-month-long drive will be launched in the district from June 1 and would go on till November. The idea is to act in advance before the onset of monsoon, a season conducive for mosquito growth and breeding, said a senior health department official. 
 
 “WHO will conduct a study in 2020 on malaria incidence in the state. The organisation will analyse and evaluate the performance by the state in this direction and issue a “Malaria-Free Haryana’ certificate. We wish to totally eradicate the disease from Haryana by then,” the official added.
