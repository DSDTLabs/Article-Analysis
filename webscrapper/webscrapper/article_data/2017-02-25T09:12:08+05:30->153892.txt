BENGALURU: Having pushed   against the wall by raking up the diary controversy,   state president and former chief minister   is getting ready to drop another bombshell on chief minister Siddaramaiah. He has threatened to release documents pertaining to  's alleged involvement in a multi-crore scam. 

 Yeddyurappa told reporters here on Friday: "It is a Rs 3,000-crore scam committed in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). I am studying the documents and will make them public in 3-4 days."
 
 Yeddyurappa, however, chose to play his cards close to his chest by not elaborating on the scam. He maintained: "All I can say at this stage is that funds meant for Bengaluru's development were diverted and the beneficiaries are top politicians in the Congress."
 
 He said: "When I first made a mention of the diary,   leaders denied its existence. But the diary is now in public domain and they are struggling to come up with an explanation. People are watching the Congress and will give it a fitting lesson."
