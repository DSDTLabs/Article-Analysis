NEW DELHI: The special cell on Monday arrested three main sharpshooters in the Monu Dariyapur   case.

 In the incident, Monu, a police officer assigned to protect him and a businessman was killed after three dozen rounds were fired at them in a crowded market in west Delhi on April 30. 
 
 DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav confirmed the arrests. According to a source, these shooters had joined hands with Rajesh Rajje and his men from Haryana and formed a “Black Cobra gang”. 
 
 The arrested men were identified as Sumit Paluthra, Sonu Kejriwal and Sandeep, police said.
 
 Sumit had met Rajje — arrested four days ago — in jail in 2011 and joined his gang. He was of late considered one of the most dreaded sharpshooters in the capital. 
 
 The hunt for the mastermind, Sonu Dariyapur, has narrowed down to Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan where he has been reported to have taken a rented accommodation and has been posing as a businessman. Massive raids are being conducted in three states to nab him and three other associates who are on the run. 
 
 A special team led by ACP Akhilesh Yadav and comprising inspectors Vijay, Vinay and Pankaj Singh were tracking the whereabouts of these men for the past three months, Yadav said.
 
 The team received inputs that the gangsters would come to Rohini in a Honda Amaze car to meet one of their associates. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the car was intercepted. “Three sophisticated pistols and 15 live cartridges have been recovered from them. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was declared by the Delhi Police and Rs 25,000 by Haryana police on each of them,” Yadav said. 
 
 During interrogation, the accused disclosed that Rajje wanted to kill Haryana gangster Ramesh Lohar where as Sonu wanted to kill Monu. Sentenced to life in a   case, Rajje had jumped parole in July 2016 to kill Lohar. “In this pursuit, the two gangs joined hands with Sonu Dariyapur to execute his plan. Rajje also promised to kill Monu Dariyapur,” Yadav added.
