Guwahati: Kamrup ( ) deputy commissioner   has asked all the offices to provide basic facilities to the public in every office and behave nicely with all visitors. 

  "I have found there is a lack of proper sitting arrangements, fans and drinking water in many offices. It may not always be possible to solve all problems of people visiting our offices, but we can at least behave nicely and make them feel good," said Mittal.
