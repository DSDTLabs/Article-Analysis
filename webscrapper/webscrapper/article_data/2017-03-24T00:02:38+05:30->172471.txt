THANE: A 44-year-old attendant, Dattaram Gurkunde, working with the regional mental health hospital suffered serious injuries after a patient stabbed him in the neck with a pair of scissors on Wednesday afternoon.

 ‘‘The patient had entered one of the nurse’s room in the evening. Alarmed on seeing the patient, the woman shouted for help. On hearing her cries, I and another attendant rushed to the spot and tried to engage the patient in a conversation. They then asked him to keep the scissors down, which he obeyed. However, when they were about to leave the room, the patient turned back, picked up the scissors and stabbed me on the neck,’’ said Gurkunde. The patient was admitted just a day before the incident. 
 
 Gurkunde is undergoing treatment at the Thane civil hospital. Doctors have kept him under observations as he suffered a deep cut that has torn his neck muscle. 
 
 A complaint has been registered with the Wagle Estate police.
