PANAJI:   residents have decided to discuss the issue of inclusion of their area into Greater Panaji Planning and Development Area at a gram sabha and petition the government against going ahead with it.

 This was decided at a public meeting at Chimbel on Saturday evening and the villagers also decided to join a morcha organized in St Cruz and extend support to the neighbouring villagers.
 
 Former MLA, Victoria Fernandes who attended the meeting expressed her opposition to the PDA proposal, stating that 12 years ago, she had participated with the people in getting it scrapped. The battle was won because the people were united, she said.
 
 Sanjay Shirodkar, a member of biodiversity management committee (BMC) of Chimbel panchayat, said that about 60 lakh square metres of hilly area with forests has been included in the proposed planning area. If the PDA comes into force, then there will be no hills and forests left in the village and biodiversity will be wiped off, he said.
 
 Social activist   criticized local MLA  , stating that if he is opposed to the PDA proposal, he should step down and join the villagers.
 
 Govind Shirodkar, an activist, questioned why PDA inclusion is being carried out in an undemocratic manner.
