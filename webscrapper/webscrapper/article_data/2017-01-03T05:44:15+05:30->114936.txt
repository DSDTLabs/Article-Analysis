MUMBAI: After a long silence on the future of its plans for  , the   Group has said it expects to begin operations in the state this year. 

 The Taiwan-based electronic equipment manufacturer had signed a high-profile memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Maharashtra government in August 2015, offering an investment of $5 billion.
 
 But almost a year and a half later, it has not yet identified a site for the project, raising questions about whether the plan had been shelved. So far it has only rented 2 lakh sq ft in Navi Mumbai as a temporary facility.
 
 Foxconn manufactures gadgets for the world's leading electronic brands, including Apple, Huawei,   and BlackBerry. Earlier this week,   announced its plans to set up a manufacturing plant in Bengaluru.
 
 In response to a questionnaire about its Maharashtra plans,   confirmed that operations were expected to begin in 2017 though it did not commit to when. "The actions that we outlined in our previous statement remain ongoing, although we are not committed to specific timetables," it said in a response sent on December 30.
 
 The company said it was committed to its plans for India and that large investments take time to materialise. Foxconn had suspended work at its two manufacturing plants in Chennai in December 2014. The company has now said its plans in Tamil Nadu could fructify in 2017. "We are planning to move forward with our (TN) operations following a project development process that is currently ongoing," it said in its statement.
 
 Foxconn said the first phase of its training under the Skill India programme would begin in 2017. "We are contributing to the goals of the Skill India program, working with the relevant government and industry bodies to recruit and train skilled workers for our operations in India. The first phase of training under this initiative will begin in 2017," the company's statement read.
