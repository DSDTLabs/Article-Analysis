MOTIHARI: Taking strong exception to Thursday’s murderous attack on  , the lone eyewitness to the murder of her brother   Raj,   DM   has written to DGP and SP seeking prompt action against the accused.

 Meanwhile, feminist groups and social activists on Saturday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to district administration to arrest those involved in Siddharth’s murder. Sweta was allegedly attacked by Ranjan Sahni, an accused in Siddharth murder case, two days before she was to depose before a Motihari court. As a result, Sweta, who sustained injuries in the attack, could not depose in court on Saturday.
