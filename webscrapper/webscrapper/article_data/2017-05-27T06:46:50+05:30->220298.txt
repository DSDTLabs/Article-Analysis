BENGALURU: Although it has been projected as one of the Centre's flagship schemes, the Congress claimed   was a "scam".   general secretary (Karnataka in-charge)   on Friday said the scheme was bigger than some of the biggest scams the country had witnessed in the recent past. 

  "The Centre is allocating crores of rupees for construction of toilets under the scheme. But, lakhs of toilets are only on paper. While the Centre claims they have constructed these toilets, most seem to vanish overnight," Venugopal said. 
 
  He claimed such instances had occurred in his own constituency, Alappuzha in Kerala. "I can show you how many toilets the Centre claimed had been completed, just disappeared in my constituency. There is no accountability in the scheme," Venugopal maintained.
