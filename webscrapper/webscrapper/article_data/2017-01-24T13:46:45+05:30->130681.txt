MUMBAI:  , a global business process management and services firm, has enhanced fully paid   for its female employees in India from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The same, said a company statement, is applicable to adopting and commissioning mothers as well.

 The   leave is accessible to women employees for giving birth to or adopting up to two children.
 
 “We are committed to finding ways to bring more women into the workforce, and once they are in, finding ways to enable continuity of employment as they balance family and work. Our aspiration is to be an industry leader in this area, and adopt market-leading practices. This is a big step in that direction,” said Piyush Mehta, SVP and Chief Human Resources Officer, Genpact.
 
 Among other initiatives for women employees, Genpact offers access to daycare facilities at or near its office locations, stork parking at all locations, work from home or flexible hours if the nature of work permits, and shift timings and location of their choice for up to a year upon return from maternity leave.
 
 “Gender diversity is among our top organizational priorities and creating a supportive ecosystem for our women is the first step in that direction. By extending the maternity leave period, we hope that our women employees will be able to strike a better work-life balance,” said Sasha Sanyal, SVP and Diversity and Inclusion Leader, Genpact.
