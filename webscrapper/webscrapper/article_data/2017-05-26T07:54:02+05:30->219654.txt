BENGALURU: Dejected at not having got a promotion at work, a 26-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide at her Vidyaranyapura home in northeast Bengaluru on Wednesday night.

 Mother of a three-year-old boy,   was found hanging from a ceiling fan inside her bedroom. When Divya's husband Chinnaiah came home at 8pm on Wednesday, no one answered the door. He found Divya hanging after he broke the door to get in.
 
 Police said they had not found any note explaining the reason for her death. “Her husband told us that Divya worked as a sales executive with a private cellular company. She was hoping to be promoted as floor manager in April, but got depressed after it was withheld,“ cops said, quoting Chinnaiah.
 
 “Her seniors had promised her a promotion based on her previous year's performance. When she received the appraisal letter, Divya was upset because she had not been given the promotion. Her colleagues said a less experienced woman bagged the post,“ Chinnaiah told police.
 
 After finishing her work, Divya picked her son from the daycare centre and left him at the house of a relative near Kodigehalli, police said.
