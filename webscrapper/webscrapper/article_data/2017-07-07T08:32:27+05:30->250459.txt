CHENNAI:   have been grappling with huge crowds and a shortage of forms as they rush to submit their applications for   ahead of the deadline on July 8. Lack of awareness over the forms being available online led to long, winding queues at many medical colleges.

 Mohamed Arshath, a medical aspirant, said that though the application process began on June 27, he was able to get the form only on July 3. “The huge crowd made it really hard. On June 27, there were around 1000 people waiting for the forms but only 250 were given out. I had to continuously go to the college for a number of days before finally receiving the form,” he said.
 
 Another candidate from Salem, T Sathishvar, said, “We went on the first day to get the forms. Although a token system was in place, many who had the tokens went back empty-handed.”
 
 Many of those who took the online route had a hassle-free experience. For Shobana Devi, another aspirant who went to the Chengalpet Medical College, it only took a day to get the DD which was made easier through internet banking.
 
 However, those who managed to access the forms online had to submit self-attested postcards along with the form. “These postcards are only available at the Kilpauk centre and so we had to go there to collect them,” said Kesavan, a parent.
 
 The medical counselling is slated to begin on July 17.
