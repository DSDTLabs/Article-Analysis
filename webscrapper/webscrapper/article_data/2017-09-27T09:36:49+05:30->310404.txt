Bhagat was going on his scooter on Kapadia Health Club Road on July 14 at around 9 pm when he was stopped by the accused. The accused demanded driving licence and papers of the vehicle from Bhagat.

 Bhagat got down from the scooter, but the accused managed to escape. Bhagat reported the incident to Khatodara police station and a non-cognizable offence was registered against an unidentified person. Bhagat was passing from the same road on July 29 with a friend when he noticed the accused collecting money from a passerby.
 
 Bhagat nabbed Shaikh and took him to Khatodara police station. Bhagat was assured by the police that the accused will be arrested. However, Shaikh was allowed to go. The complainant approached police commissionerâ€™s office on Monday and a complaint was registered. 
 
 Shaikh was suspended from the police force in February 2015 after a prisoner escaped from his custody at New Civil Hospital. He was dismissed in July 2016, but reinstated in March 2017, thanks to intervention of some officers.
