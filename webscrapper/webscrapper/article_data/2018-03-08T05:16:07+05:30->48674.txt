MUMBAI: The railways plan to initially run 49 services between CSMT-Goregaon, probably from around Gudi Padwa, March 18, and extend all services a few weeks later. There are presently 91 services between CSMT-Andheri.

 The commissioner of railway safety has granted approval to run the additional services.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 A senior railway official said, “We plan to run 49 services in phase I. The balance services will be extended when the new timetable comes up in April-May.”
 
 After years of delay, the harbour line corridor’s extension up to   was scheduled to be open to commuters by December 2017. The date was revised to January 2018 but minor pending work led to a delay in its opening. It was then believed that it would be inaugurated along with the three army-built foot over bridges on February 27, but that too did not happen.
 
 A   official said, “We have finalised the crew and no work is remaining. We are ready to commence services at any moment.”
 
 Another official said, “We are awaiting a green signal from the railway board, as Union railway minister   is expected to flag off the services.” The government wants to make a show of strength as BJP wants to upstage  , which also has a strong presence in the Goregaon-Jogeshwari belt.
 
 Once the line is extended, WR plans to extend some Churchgate services to the   line too so that more people can benefit.
