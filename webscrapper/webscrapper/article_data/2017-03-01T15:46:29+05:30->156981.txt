CHENNAI:   Traders Association’s call to shopkeepers to   US soft drink brands   and Coca Cola and sell only local brands evoked a partial response on Wednesday. 

 The association took the decision to boycott   and Pepsi during the 
  in the state in January as the US-based NGO People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was responsible for the Supreme Court ban on the bull-taming sport. “PeTA was responsible for the ban on  . That is why we decided to boycott American soft drinks in the state starting March 31,” said an official of the traders’ association.
 
 The association said the two US companies were drawing plenty of water, and this has affected water sources of people and crops.
 
 Most small traders in North Chennai, Trichy and Salem stopped selling Pepsi and Coke in response to the boycott call. In Salem, shopkeepers stopped selling Aquafina too, a drinking water brand from PepsiCo.
 
 There are several lakhs of small traders in the state. 
 
 Some traders told TOI that the association was pressurising them not to stock US brands to “promote local cola brands.” “In the past one month, association office-bearers have been asking us not to stock Coke or Pepsi. However, the demand from our customers has not come down and we have been selling them till now,” said a shopkeeper at Nandanam in Chennai.
 
 “We stopped placing orders Pepsi and Coke two weeks ago. We don’t have any stock now. People are asking for Pepsi and Coke,” said A Ramakrishnan, a trader in Trichy. 
 
 Pepsi and Coke continued to be sold in departmental shops and malls across the state.
