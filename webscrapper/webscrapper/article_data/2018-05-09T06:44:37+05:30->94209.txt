KOLKATA: The decision of   ( ) to introduce semester exams and choice-based credit system in undergraduate arts and science faculties has fuelled concerns among affiliated colleges that now are set to get more autonomy. While some teachers raised question over the teacher-student ratio, others pointed out that evaluation may get affected as semester system has to work within a very limited schedule, offering less flexibility to teachers.

 CU has convened a one-day workshop on May 12 where teachers and principals will discuss CBCS-Admission and Examination Regulations that is to be introduced from 2018-2019 academic session.
 
  
  
 “To start CBCS and semester exam together, there are certain preconditions in which the student and teacher ratio is very vital. To make the semester system work, the student intake has to be restricted. Otherwise, the format won’t work,” said a college principal.
 
 
 Some teachers argued that even before the first semester ends or the results get published, classes for the next semester will have to start. “In such short duration, if the number of students can’t be restricted, the negative impact will be on evaluation of answer scripts as well as on next semester classes,” a teacher said.
 
 
 Moreover, principals are also concerned regarding who to fix responsibility upon as the number of teachers in science and humanities department are inconsistent. “There is an acute crunch of teachers. They do not even have the four required teachers per department,” a source said. Teachers are also in the dark over issues like framing the curriculum and the evaluation pattern. “Nothing was discussed with them. Instead, the authorities took the decision singlehandedly,” alleged   general secretary Srutinath Praharaj.
 
 
 CU VC Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee, however, assured that the   has been made foolproof. “We will meet teachers on May 12, listen to them and then redress the problems, if any,” she said.
