NOIDA: The official website of   Rera, where the builders would be able to register or declare their projects as   compliant, is expected to be ready by the end of July.

 Till such time, builders willing to declare their projects Rera compliant would have to do it with hard copies of documents. The documents could be submitted with the interim Rera or the housing secretary of the government of Uttar Pradesh in Lucknow. 
 
 According to Manoj Gaur, president, CREDAI –  , the process to go online has started and is only a matter of time. “Rera registration is nothing but a declaration of compliances with all the norms set by Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. So, only when a builder violates the agreed norms of Rera, does the prevailing law come into play. At the moment, the drill is about getting registered,”   said.
 
 Meanwhile, buyers who have been pushing for Fight for Rera, have tried to take up their issue with   minister Dr Mahesh Sharma. “Buyers have taken their pleas to both Singh and Sharma and they have reassured that whatever was promised to the buyers would be met with eventually as soon the regulator is selected,” Abhishek Kumar, president, Nefowa, said
 
 “Rera is already in play and the implementation process is on its last leg. There’s no reason for buyers to get impatient,” Manoj Gaur said.
