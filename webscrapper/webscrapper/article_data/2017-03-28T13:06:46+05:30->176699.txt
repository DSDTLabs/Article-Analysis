The duo took off to Tbilisi in Georgia last week, along with singer  , to shoot a recreated version of his popular song, ' , which will be used as a promotional track for the film.
"Irrfan and Saba will be dancing to the tunes of this peppy number along with Sukhbir. It is one of Irrfan's favourite songs and both Saba and he start grooving as soon as it comes on. The vibe on the sets is lively and Sukhbir singing live added to the energy of the song," informs a source present on the set.
 
 Saket and his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani spent nearly a year-and-ahalf writing the script. “It's a sliceof-life comedy about the aspirations and struggles of Delhi's middle-class,“ a source had told Mirror earlier.
 
 Produced by Dinesh Vijan and Bhushan Kumar, Hindi Medium has Irrfan playing a rich Punjabi clothes store owner from Chandni Chowk who, along with his wife, is eager to be accepted in the Capital's elite circles.
