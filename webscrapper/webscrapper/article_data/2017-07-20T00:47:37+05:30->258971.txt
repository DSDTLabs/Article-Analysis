Madurai: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Wednesday ordered notice to the government on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking to quash the government order making Plus One examination as public examination.

 K K Ramesh from Madurai filed the petition. It came up for admission before the division bench of justices K K Sasidharan and G R Swaminathan on Wednesday. The petitioner said that the stateâ€™s school education department issued the government order on May 22, this year, which is against the welfare of students, teachers and education department. 
 
 In the state, students studying Class 10 are already facing difficulty as they are compelled by the class teachers to go for tuitions to score more marks. If the Plus One examination is changed to public examination, it will affect the students further. 
 
 Before passing the GO, the government should have consulted with teachers and parents. But, it failed to do it. Hence, it is necessary to stay the operation of the government order and to quash the same as illegal, the petitioner said.
