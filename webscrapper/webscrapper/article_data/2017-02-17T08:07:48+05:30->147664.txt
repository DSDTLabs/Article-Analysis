BENGALURU : In addition to some of the country’s best pilots, Aero India has brought to the city a special bunch of individuals, whose job, unlike those of the pilots, largely entails jumping off the aircraft. A good day at work for these soldiers would involve a visit across the border, right into the enemy’s backyard. 

 Performance by the team from the 320th Special Tactics Squadron from America, left the audience in awe, when they leapt off a flight at an altitude of 7,000ft – higher than Karnataka’s tallest peak. The method is largely used by these doughty soldiers to enter combat zones.
 
 The   unit of the US Air Force comprises rescue men and combat controllers, who enter combat zones to prepare the ground for military operations behind enemy lines. They are also responsible for handling evacuation, setting up medical facilities and rescue operations on some of the deadliest battlefields for the US Air Force. Members of the Indian Army’s 2nd Para Special Forces too were part of the performance.
 
 Meanwhile, members of the   (NSG), armed with snipers, kept close watch on the proceedings at Yelahanka Air Force Station. The Special Action Group (SAG), members of which were present at  , is the offensive and counter-terrorism arm of the NSG.
 
 Garud commandos from the Special Forces wing of the Indian Air Force prowled silently around. Trained for special operations, the Garuds are tasked with rescuing pilots shot down across the border, laser heating targets to help fighter planes identify them, among other difficult missions.
