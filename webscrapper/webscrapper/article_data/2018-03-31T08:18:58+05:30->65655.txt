KANNUR: 'Homage to the principal who has died in the hearts of the students... a tragedy is over and the campus is getting free', said a poster in Malayalam, that appeared on the walls of the Nehru Arts and Science College, Kanhangad. On March 29, the students of the college also burst crackers on the campus to celebrate the retirement of their principal P V  . This bizarre send-off ceremony happened even as an official farewell meet was going on in the college, ahead of her retirement on May 31. 

  
  
 
 
 
 The incident reminded many of the highhandedness displayed by students against two other woman principals -- the 'symbolic funeral' SFI students had organized at Government Victoria College, Palakkad, in April, 2016, to mock their principal T N   and the burning of the chair of N L Beena, the principal of Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, in January, 2017.
 
 College authorities are of the view that students vented their ire on Pushpaja as she was considered a disciplinarian. The SFI has distanced itself from the controversy but the college management is planning to take legal and disciplinary action against the students, some of whom have been identified as SFI sympathizers.
 
 "This is totally against the discipline of the college. The only thing she wanted was to ensure that the students attend classes regularly," said college manager Vijayaraghavan K.
 
 Pushpaja, a former student of the college, had worked as a teacher for 33 years in the institution before being elevated to the post of principal.
 
 "I'm in a state of shock and don't know if I should take legal action," said Pushpaja. She is active in the pro-Congress Kerala Private College Teachers Association.
 
 "None of the office bearers of the SFI has any role in the incident," said SFI Kasaragod district secretary K Mahesh. The organization should not be blamed for the mischief of a few students, he said.
