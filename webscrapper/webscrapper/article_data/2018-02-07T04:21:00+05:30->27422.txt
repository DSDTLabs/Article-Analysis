Vadodara: Haphazard parking of vehicles and crowds led to chaos during the counting for the village panchayat polls in the city. The counting for the panchayats in the Vadodara taluka was held at the district education officerâ€™s office in the Karelibaug that is predominantly a residential area.

 The counting in Karelibaug had led to vehicles being parked at the entrance of residential societies and even on their internal roads. With large number of supporters of candidates present at the office, the police was also forced to close the road for traffic to prevent any untoward incident. In wake of the situation, Congress city unit vice president Shailesh Amin shot a letter to the district collector stating that the counting should be shifted to some other location on the outskirts of the city.
 
 Amin said that due to the situation, it became difficult for students to reach their schools. He claimed that even ambulances that were going to hospitals in the area were stranded.
