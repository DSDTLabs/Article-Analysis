Bhandara: The body of   Bhotmange, the lone survivor of the Khairlanji massacre who died following a heart attack in Nagpur on Friday, was brought to his Mhada Colony residence in Bhandara on Saturday.

 A large number of dalit activists and leaders of various political parties paid floral tributes to Bhotmange. Senior dalit leader Jogendra Kawade presided over a special condolence meeting where MLC Prakash Gajbhiye, ex-MLA Upendra Shende, Ravi Shende and others paid tributes.
 
 Kawade said that the court only delivered its verdict in the Khairlanji massacre case and not justice. “We will continue our fight to ensure justice prevails,” Kawade said.
 
 On September 29, 2006, Bhaiyyalal’s wife Surekha, daughter Priyanka and sons Sudhir and Rohan, were lynched by a mob in Khairlanji village in Mohadi tehsil of Bhandara. Eight persons were awarded life imprisonment in the case by the high court, an appeal against which is pending in the Supreme Court.
 
 Bhadant Arya Nagarjun Surei Sasai performed Budhha Vandana and Samta Sainik Dal volunteers gave last salute to him. Later, Bhotmange’s body was taken to Deulgaon village (Mohadi tehsil) where it was laid to rest near the place where his wife, daughter and two sons were buried.
