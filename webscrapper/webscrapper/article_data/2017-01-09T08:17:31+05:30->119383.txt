NEW DELHI: There is no end to 55-year-old Vibha Matta’s ordeal, a witness to the bloodbath her son unleashed to kill her husband  . The 60-year-old returned to India from Canada three months ago to take care of Vibha, who is a heart patient, and save her from their son’s torture. 

 Vibha escaped Rahul Matta’s wrath as she was at a neighbour’s house at the time of incident. She told TOI that she had requested her husband to come and save her but never knew that their son would kill him. “We always asked Rahul to behave but he never failed to embarrass us in front of others. He would beat us day and night and keep threatening us if we didn’t let him do what he wanted to. He would go mad if we did not give him money. There was not much we could do, so we decided to disown him. We had also asked the guard not to allow him inside the society,” said an inconsolable Vibha.
 
 Her neighbour,  , an actor, lost his house in the explosion executed by Rahul. “Where would we go now? We have no home,” said a shell-shocked Sharma. “We had nothing to do with this, yet, have to pay this price. However, our pain is nothing compared to what Vibha has undergone.” 
 
 Sharma’s musician son, Kashish, said, “I have spent all my savings on buying instruments. I am happy that Rahul is unharmed but it is devastating to see the remains of my drum kit and guitars.” 
 
 Other residents are also in shock. “We had never heard of anything as grievous as this. Ravinder and his wife took a long time to disown him. I remember warning them about Rahul some time back as well but they let it pass,” said  , a neighbour. 
 
 Ravinder’s close friend,  , said, “Minutes before the incident, I received a call from Ravinder. He was to go to the gurdwara but postponed it to get a friend’s car repaired.”
