BHOPAL: A tiger was found dead close to a farmhouse near   in MP’s Umaria district on Saturday morning, taking this year’s death toll to eight. 

 As many as 64 tigers have died in MP since January 2015, dealing a major blow to the state government’s ambition of reclaiming the status of ‘Tiger State’ this census. 
 
 The tiger found dead near Bandhavgarh looks to be around two years old, said forest officials. The decomposed carcass was spotted near  , close to the farmhouse of a former   MLA. 
 
 Field director Mrudul Pathak said, “It seems to be a case of infighting. On March 29, guards at the farmhouse had informed us about a fight between tigers. Our teams rushed to the spot. Tigress T-16, which had four cubs, had hunted a Cheetal. But a dominating male tiger arrived and there was fighting over the kill. We managed to push them apart. It seems that there was another fight the same night, leading to the death of the cub.”
 
 The farmhouse guards did not go to the area for two days out of fear. On Saturday, they finally went there and saw the carcass, said Pathak, adding that samples have been taken for forensic analysis. Sources say all the body parts of the cub were intact. 
 
 “The tiger density in the park has increased above its carrying capacity. The park is spread over 700 square kilometres and ideally should have 70 to 75 tigers. But as per the internal assessment in 2016, we had 85 adult tigers and 40-42 cubs. Thus, there are frequent incidents of infighting,” Pathak explained.
 
 Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey has written to National Tiger Conservation Authority, alleging mismanagement by Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve authorities. In all, 33 tigers have died in MP in the past 19 months — the highest of all states. Last week, a tiger was found dead in Raisen district.
