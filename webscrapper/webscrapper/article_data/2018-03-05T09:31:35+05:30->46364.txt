CHENNAI: Anusha Swamy once came across the father of a child with Down syndrome who remarked, “I hope my child passes away before I do.” The exchange moved her and led her to start an initiative for the differently abled that would help them earn enough money to sustain themselves.

 Swamy’s initiative, A+ Max, was launched on the photo-sharing app Instagram in October 2017 as a platform to sell handmade tote bags, mats and colorful candles made by those with Down syndrome. 
 
 A full-time choreographer and make-up artist, Swamy has also been working on initiatives with the Down   (DSFI) for the past seven years.
 
 It was through an annual conference that she met parents of those with the syndrome and understood the stress they endure. “All of us have sympathy to offer to the differently abled. They need opportunities to sustain themselves,” she said.
 
 In another incident, she recounted how a father who was so distressed that he wanted to leave his child at the orphanage.
 
 A+ Max’s exhibits will move to a café in Besant Nagar soon. “I started this initiative for kids with Down syndrome as I have worked with them. I wish to include more of the differently abled community,” said Swamy.
 
 “The kids involved are those from the DSFI. They make the products themselves at the centre. Most of the money goes into deposits for these kids so that their future is secure,” she said. “There is so much potential in these people. Many are extremely active and have represented India in the Special Olympics.”
 
 She added that she sees more openness among people. “People are coming forward to buy products like cloth bags because it is for a cause,” she added.
