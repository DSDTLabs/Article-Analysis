GHAZIABAD:   took charge as   while Hari Narayan Singh assumed office as the senior superintendent of police of   on Saturday.

 A 2003 batch IAS officer, Ministhy was special secretary at the home department prior to her appointment as Ghaziabad  . Spelling out her priorities, she said that her focus will be on improving the plight of women and children.
 
 “Being a woman, I have a soft spot for women and children and would try to implement government schemes for women and children to improve their lot,” Ministhy told TOI. “Crimes against women and children is something which I intend to take up seriously and will work in close coordination with the police to ensure that justice is meted out to them,” Ministhy said.
 
 Ministhy, a gold medallist in personnel management and industrial relations from Xavier Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur, before joining IAS, is an avid writer who has authored four books including ‘Learning with Tippy Tortoise: Tales for Kids’, ‘Happy Birthday: Poems for Kids’ and ‘25 Pearls for Children’.
 
 Her love for little ones is evident from the fact that all her books are for children. However, beneath her gentle side there is a no-nonsense administrator. As DM of Mainpuri, which happens to be the pocket borough of SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, she took on the political establishment while enforcing the model code of conduct and initiated action against 100 illegal arms dealers, much to the displeasure of the then SP government.
 
 Meanwhile, Hari Narayan Singh took charge as Ghaziabad  . Singh was earlier attached to the director general of police’s office. Singh told TOI that his priority would be to control petty crimes, especially chain-snatching. “We will work to ensure that petty crime like chain-snatching incidents are kept under check as it is rampant in Ghaziabad,” Singh said.
