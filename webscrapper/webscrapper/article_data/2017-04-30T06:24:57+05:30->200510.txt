PATNA: The number of stillbirths in   is decreasing, but its rate is still less than the national average.
 
  As per the   (WHO) prescriptions, stillborn is a “baby born with no sign of life at or after 28 weeks of its mother’s pregnancy”. The rate of stillbirths is computed as the number of stillbirths per 1,000 live births.
  
  However, the case of a stillbirth — male or female — is still not accorded deserved attention in the state, observers feel. Recently, people in Patna were shocked to read reports about dogs eating the abandoned body of a baby, born by way of stillbirth, on the   premises. Shockingly, in the recent past, the frequent cases of stillborn babies abandoned in the wild bushes of Bhagalpur town to be eaten by dogs or by the black and brown ants have also been reported.
  
  When contacted, programme officer of the maternal health wing of   (SHS), Dr  , admitted the cases of stillbirths was a reality in the state and the number of stillborn babies are also recorded in the health management information system (HIMS).
  
  “But the important point to note is if the number of stillbirths is decreasing or increasing?” he asked and, in the same vein, added: “The rate of reduction of stillbirths in Bihar has also been recorded and is available for reference in the Centre’s data pool that is prepared periodically. The number of stillbirths is declining, even as the reduction rate compared to the national percentage is low.”
  
  According to him, the rate of reduction of stillbirths in Bihar as recorded in the country’s HMIS was 1.67% in 2014-15, followed by 1.40% in 2015-16 and it was 1.28% till February this year. He also said Bihar did not make the worst case scenario in the country. The national average of stillbirths reduction is 2%, which is less than the global average of 2.4%.
