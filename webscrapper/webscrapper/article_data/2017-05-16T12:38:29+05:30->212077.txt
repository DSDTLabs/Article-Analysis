Nagpur: Mom was the zing thing at Deshpande Hall on Monday evening as singers came up with a superb mix of ghazals and soulful Sufi songs at a musical programme ‘Aisi Hoti Hai Maa’ organized by Tamanna Events and Entertainment (TEE), at Civil Lines.

 Managing director of Tamanna Firoz Sheikh said that the organization’s main objective is to shift from the usual Bollywood songs and focus on soulful music of ghazals and Sufi songs. “We always try to find budding artistes in the city and provide them a stage to showcase their talent,” he said.
 
 Nehal Khan, a former contestant at popular reality shows ‘Little Champs’ and ‘Indian Idol’, sang ‘Vande Mataram’ to pay tribute to mother earth. 
 
 Later, Srushti Barlewar, who is trained as a singer since childhood, sung ‘Lori suna’. The incredible performance accompanied by director Asif Khan poetry recitation mesmerized the audience.
 
 Hits like ‘Tu kitni achhi hai’ were followed by ghazal performance by Junaid Khan, a student of Ustad Ghulam Ali. The singers had tears in their eyes as their mothers sat in the audience and cheered them.
 
 Guest artistes Neha Banerjee, Umamma Ahmed and Pranali Satarkar also performed at the event. Trade union leader SQ Zama was the chief guest at the event.
