LUCKNOW:   followed by a brief spell of   on Wednesday afternoon brought much needed relief from an intense heat wave that had gripped the city for the past few days. Daytime temperatures dropped to 37.5 degree Celsius, which was three degrees below normal. 

 The drop in maximum temperatures was significant considering the heat wave which had been keeping mercury notched up at 42 degrees and above in the past few days. State met department said cloudy sky is likely to prevail for another four days and would keep daytime   relatively low.
 
 Met director J P Gupta said rains occurred after low pressure area hovering over central and east UP were fed by moisture-laden   from the east. The department said the low pressure area may fade in another four days after which heat wave would resume.
 
 The department issued a forecast of rains and thundershowers in parts of western and central UP in the next 24 hours. The rains may, however, increase humidity levels which in turn may cause discomfort, said the weatherman.
 
 The neighbouring Kanpur too saw its maximum temperatures plummeting to 35 degree Celsius which was five degree below normal. Even Allahabad, which recorded a maximum temperatures of 46 degree just two days ago, saw the mercury plunging down to 40.8 degree Celsius. The parched Bundelkhand region too received a spell of much needed showers bringing down maximum temperatures considerably. Banda, which recently recorded a maximum temperatures of around 47 degrees, saw its day time temperatures coming down to 42.2 degree Celsius.
 
 Bahraich in east UP recorded maximum rains of 44mm, followed by Basti which received 37mm of rains. Hamirpur in Bundelkhand recorded around 6mm of rains.
