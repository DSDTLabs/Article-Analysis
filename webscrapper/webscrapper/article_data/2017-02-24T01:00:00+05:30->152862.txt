A reality show winner and a playback singer,   who is currently judging   India, was thrilled to see her screen idol   on her show. Apparently, on seeing Govinda, Neeti ran towards him and started telling him how she hasloved the actor for the longest time. 

  
  
 
 Says a source, “The actor just smiled and asked her if she was an actress. Neeti, who has been a huge fan of Govinda, was disappointed that he did not recognise her. That’s when Shaan, who’s also a judge on the show, intervened and introduced Neeti to him.” However, when we asked Neeti about this, she denied it saying, “Govindaji is such a senior actor. We exchanged a lot of information and even danced together. He complimented me and said I looked like an actress.”
