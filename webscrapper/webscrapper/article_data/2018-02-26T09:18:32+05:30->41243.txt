SALIGAO: Construction of a new panchayat ghar was the main issue raised at the   ordinary gram sabha held at the   at Nagoa on Sunday.

 During the gram sabha, the budget for the year 2018-19 was read out and the income showed Rs 1.90crore, while the expenditure showed Rs 1.92 crore. 
 
 The Arpora panchayat has kept a provision of Rs 37 lakh for garbage collection.
 
 The villagers questioned the gram sabha on the status of the panchayat ghar which is the need of the hour as Arpora panchayat does not have a hall to conduct gram sabhas or any other function pertaining to the village.
 
 Arpora sarpanch   told the gram sabha that the village panchayat will be getting a new garbage truck. 
 
 “When this vehicle is brought, then the panchayat will carry out door-to-door garbage collection every day. As of now, it is done only on alternate days,” the sarpanch said.
 
 The sarpanch also brought to the notice of the gram sabha that the panchayat will be constructing a shed for the benefit of the garbage contractor to carry out segregation of waste in the monsoon.
 
 A villager raised the issue of increasing the provision of money in the budget to collect garbage in the village as the panchayat needs Rs 3-4 lakh per month for it.
 
 Anna D’Mello, a resident, raised the issue of maintaining public wells and requested the panchayat to put pressure on hotels to carry out maintenance of these wells as most of them are being polluted due to sewage water being released by hotels.
 
 The sarpanch told the gram sabha that all public wells will be maintained for future generations.
