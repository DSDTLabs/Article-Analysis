LUCKNOW: The city political grapevine buzzed on Friday as   patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's younger daughter-in-law,  , and her husband  , went to meet chief minister   at the VVIP guest house.

 While Aparna and everyone else in the family said it was “a courtesy call“, the 20minute meeting drew huge interest in the state capital. Aparna, who has known Yogi for a long time, said the visit should not be seen through a political lens. “This is courtesy , not politics,“ she told reporters. Aparna was accompanied by her brother Aman as well.
 
 Both Aparna and Aditya Nath, who was Ajay Bisht before taking sanyaas, belong to Garhwal in Uttarakhand.Aparna and Prateek, in fact, were the only ones from the Yadav family to visit Aditya Nath in Gorakhpur in September 2014, after the death of his guru, Mahant Avaidyanath.
 
 Aparna, who contested the assembly elections from   and lost to BJP's Rita Bahuguna Joshi -she is a minister in the Yogi cabinet -did not take questions on her defeat. However, sources said that she was upset over her loss as she felt she had done a good job of reaching out to the constituents. “In 2012, Rita Bahuguna Joshi secured 63,000 votes and became a winner. Aparna secured 61,000 votes in 2017, which is not bad for a beginner, especially from a seat that her party never won. She is evaluating the reasons at the moment,“ said a close friend.
