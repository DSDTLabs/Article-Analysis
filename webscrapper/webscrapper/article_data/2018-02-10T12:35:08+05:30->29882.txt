PHULPUR: There’s something common between 70-year-old Suraj Patel, his son and grandson Raju—apart from the genes—they all have been managing a tea stall for the last 20 years at   in trans-Ganga area.

 Sadly there are many families like Patels in  , which is set to go to bypolls on March 14, who feel that youngsters in the district lack suitable employment opportunities despite being represented by veterans like former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.
 
 Youths in Phulpur are a dissatisfied lot due to the lack of jobs and often migrate to metro cities in search for better opportunities.
 
 As the district administration gets busy with byelections after the date was announced, the excitement is yet to catch on with the locals. Most people seemed least interested in discussing political parties and their agenda for the bypolls. They claimed that the government needs to pay attention to more important issues in the area like the problem of unemployment and the power crisis.
 
 “Different political parties have represented Phulpur, yet the fate of the area especially youngsters remains unchanged,” claimed locals.
 
 “Though there has been little improvement in roads network, health care and education but unemployment still remains a key topic for discussion among locals” they added.
 
 The Phulpur parliamentary seat comprises five assembly seats—Phulpur, Phaphamau, City North , City West and Soraon.
 
 Dharamraj, a resident of Jaitwardeeh village believes that there is unequal development in villages of the district.
