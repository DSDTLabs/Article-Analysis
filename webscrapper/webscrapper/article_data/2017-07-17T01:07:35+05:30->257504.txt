Navi Mumbai: It’s raining good news for residents of Uran as on Sunday the water level touched the lower gate   line in   dam, a major drinking water supply reservoir for this coastal town. 

 Heavy rains in the last three days have taken the season’s total rainfall to 700 mm. The dam level has touched 112 feet, the full capacity being 116.5 feet. 
 
 According MIDC sources, water cuts will soon be reduced to half and Tuesday shutdown will be withdrawn in the next few days. 
 
 Monsoon revellers are expected to flock the dam the next weekend to make the most of the heavy showers and the overflowing waters.
 
 Ransai dam supplies around 35 MLD water to Uran township, ONGC, the defence installation,   and 22 grampanchayats in the taluka. 
 
 The dam has received 700mm in the catchment area till Sunday. 
 
 “We hope MIDC will soon withdraw the Tuesday water cuts so that we can have 6 days of supply,” said Ram Trimukhe, a local resident.
 
  While the Tuesday cut will be restored soon, the Friday shutdown will continue for the weekly maintenance,” said an MIDC engineer.
