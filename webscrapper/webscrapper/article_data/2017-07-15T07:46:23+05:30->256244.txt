PUDUCHERRY: Lt governor   lauded deputy inspector general of prisons of Karnataka,   for exposing ‘special facilities and treatment’ given to late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide and AIADMK (Amma) general secretary   at   jail in Bengaluru. 

 Bedi, the country’s first woman IPS officer known for launching several reforms at Tihar Jail, in a tweet said the country needs more officers like Roopa. “We need more of her kind. Such officers are not easy to find these days, those who have the courage to speak and write the truth as they see knowing well that they may not get support from some senior quarters,” she said.
 
 Stating that Roopa had the courage to expose corruption and she must be respected for it, Bedi advised her to keep going strong. “Wherever you be posted country needs you. You will inspire younger generations to be like you,” she said.
 
 Roopa while promptly thanking Bedi, said, Thanks madam, a word of support from you is equal to gaining the strength of hundred elephants.”
