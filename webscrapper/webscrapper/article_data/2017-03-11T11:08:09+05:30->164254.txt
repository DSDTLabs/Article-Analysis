KOCHI: While the walkway at   remained empty on Thursday following the attack by the  , a few youngsters on Friday mustered courage to show up at the waterfront to enjoy another evening with their loved ones. While most of the benches remained unoccupied, some couples were seen finding ‘shelter’ underneath trees along the APJ   marg where the   goons harassed youths on Wednesday afternoon.

 Youths at the walkway were of the view that those who were chased away must have been from outside Kochi. “They must have been from outside the city. If any of us from Kochi or Vypeen were here then we would have responded against the moral goons,” said Laigy, a youth from Vypeen.
 
 Another young woman said that the men on the day of assault would have remained silent fearing public shaming. “They may have had apprehensions about social stigmatization as even camera crews were present. They might have left without even questioning the legality of the action,” said Jibi. 
 
 Two women police officers have been deputed on the walkway to avoid any untoward incidents. “The plan is prevention, we can’t take the side of those annoyed by the presence of the couples nor can we allow minor girls spending time here after bunking classes. We have been given directions to keep a vigil at the spot to avoid any more incidents,” said a woman police officer at the spot.
 
 Meanwhile, police are planning to seek custody of the eight Shiva Sena activists who are in judicial custody.
