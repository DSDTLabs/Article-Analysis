GURUGRAM: A Delhi resident was arrested for allegedly opening a   account using fake documents and using it to dupe people into investing in a dubious insurance policy. 

 
 The scam was brought to light when one of the victims complained to the bank where the accused made him deposit money. The manager of the bank branch in question called the accused to the branch on the pretext of completing the   formalities on Saturday, and handed him over to police.
 
 According to the complaint filed by the bank manager of Allahabad Bank’s Bajghera branch, Deep Sharma, a resident of Rohini Sector 21, Delhi, opened an account in the name of ‘National Care’ on March 16 at the branch. He had deposited copies of his Aadhaar card, driving licence and PAN card as identity and address proof.
 
 On April 21, the bank received a complaint from Vinod Gupta, a resident of Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, who alleged that he was made to deposit a total of Rs 66,150 in two installments of Rs 42,150 and Rs 24,000 over the past few months, but didn’t get insurance policy as promised by Sharma. He also provided Sharma’s mobile number. The bank immediately froze the account. An FIR has been filed under sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery), 471 (using forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at Bajghera police station.
