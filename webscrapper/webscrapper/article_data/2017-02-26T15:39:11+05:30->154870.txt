Nick   and John Mulaney kicked off their hosting gig at the 2017 Film Independent Spirit Awards with punchlines centering on Mel Gibson and former filmmaker  . 

 The introduction to the hilarious monologue also noted President   administration's recent decision to revoke federal protections for transgender students.
 
 "We like to think of these awards as the ones without Mel Gibson," said Kroll of the 'Hacksaw Ridge' director. 
 
 "People wondered: how long would it take Hollywood to forgive someone for anti-semitic, racist hate speech?," he added. 
 
 To which Mulaney, 34, answered, "Eight years! So look out for the 2024 Oscars, when the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award goes to Mr   Bannon." 
 
  
  
 Bannon is currently serving as assistant to the President and White House chief strategist in the Trump administration. 
 
 "The only reason he got that job is because he's so hot," continued Kroll, 38. 
 
 "He looks like if Nick Offerman drowned." Mulaney added of Bannon, "Oh, those chapped kneecaps!" 
 
 While taking aim at Trump's decision, Mulaney said, "Hey, Trump you and   are both rich sociopaths from New York real estate empires. Yet, somehow Robert Durst is more likable." 
 
 The two also poked fun at the nominated films. 
 
 "These films are, to quote the president, 'Sad!'," said Mulaney, with Kroll stressing, "These movies were so harsh, I had to watch 'A Dog's Purpose' to cheer up, and I   the behind-the-scenes footage!"
