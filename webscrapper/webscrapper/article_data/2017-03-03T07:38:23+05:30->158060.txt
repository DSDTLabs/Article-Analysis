 During last hearing, the court directed the deans of GMC, IGGMC and Super Speciality Hospital (SSH) to go ahead with purchases of equipment without waiting for the administrative approval from the government.
 
 A division bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and justice Indira Jain tersely asked the government on why deans were required to move to Mantralaya every time for seeking administrative approval for purchase of vital equipment needed for these hospitals.
 
 The court’s orders came after amicus curiae submitted an affidavit stating that GMC and IGGMC failed to utilize Rs3 crore grant while SSH had Rs5 crore in its kitty which were not spent.
 
 The judges pointed out that on October 29, 2015, HC passed an order that deans wouldn’t be required to wait for administrative approval for spending funds and if they failed to do so, they would be held liable for contempt. However, the government recently came out with a GR prohibiting all deans from spending funds of over Rs50,000 without its approval.
