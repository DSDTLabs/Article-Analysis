KOLKATA: The new year begins with a disappointment for the Indian archers as the week-long   meet, scheduled to be held at New Delhi from January 31 was postponed at the last moment. This is the second time that the event has met this fate. Delhi was scheduled to hold the event in 2015, too which the   ( ) planned to hold at the historic  , but fell through.

 It was initially learnt that the event got postponed as the government has denied AAI the No-Objection Certificate (NOC) as they have still not amended their constitution according to the Sports Code. However, AAI secretary secretary general   denied this contention.
 
 “We had to postpone the meet as only five nations had confirmed their participation. That’s why I suggested the postponement at the Asian body meeting in Taiwan on January 17. Everybody felt it’s better to have a wider participation and accepted the proposal,” he told TOI.
 
 Kamineni, however, confirmed that the event, for which the AAI had already made hotel bookings and other arrangements, will be held later this year. He also assured that AAI would amend its constitution in a month or two.
 
 The AAI may have its reasons but the archers have been left in the lurch. “We were preparing for the India team selection trials scheduled on January 27 and 28. Only at the last moment we got to know that the event has been postponed,” said a national archer.
 
 The tournament as well as the trials were supposed to be held at  , Surajmal Vihar, in New Delhi.
 
 The AAI has also failed to come out with a domestic calendar. Both the senior and sub-junior nationals have been postponed and no new dates have been announced. “We are practising but we don’t know when will we get to compete in a real event,” an Olympian archer told TOI.
