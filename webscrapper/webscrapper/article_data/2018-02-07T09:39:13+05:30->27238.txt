KARUR: A Class XI student suffered multiple injuries after he was   by his school teacher near Karur on Tuesday.

  A case has been filed against the teacher at the Velliyanai police station in this regard while the student is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Karur.
 
 Physical education teacher   and the student,  , — both of  , Manavadi — had been at loggerheads for a while. Rahman, 16, a native of   in Dindigul district, is also a cricketer and used to play at his school as well as a private club. This didn’t go down well with the 38-year-old PE teacher, who also hails from Dindigul and he had instructed Rahman to refrain from playing at the club. 
 
 Since the student continued playing for his club, both used to constantly spar over it. On Tuesday morning, Rahman was picked on again by his teacher resulting in a tussle which was however brought under control by the school staff. 
 
 But later, around 2.30 pm, when Rahman and Paneerselvam met again, it resulted in pushing and shoving. An enraged Paneerselvam pulled out a knife – the one tied illegally to a rooster’s leg during rooster fights – and allegedly stabbed Rahman in his chest, hip and shoulder. 
 
 The staff grabbed the knife from the teacher and sent the student to a private hospital in Karur. Meanwhile, Paneerselvam fled the place and got himself admitted at a government hospital saying that he was attacked by the student.
