VADODARA: Around 42 persons including 30 young girls in early 20s were rushed to the state-run   late on Tuesday night after they complained of vomiting and diarrhoea in a suspected case of food poisoning. 
 
 Most of them hailing from different parts of Maharashtra, had consumed lunch at a call centre located in Chhani area of the city before they fell sick. 
  
 Sources said that in total 140 persons from Maharashtra had joined the call centre where undergoing training since February 22. The call centre authorities had made necessary arrangements for their boarding and lodging for the duration of the training. On Tuesday afternoon, the victims had their lunch at the call centre which was arranged by a private caterer. On Tuesday evening, however, most of the trainees started complaining of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
  
 The sudden surge in the number of trainees falling sick created quite a chaos at the call centre which arranged for autos, private cars and ambulances to rush all those affected to SSG Hospital. While some of them were discharged after primary treatment, others were undergoing further treatment at the hospital till late Wednesday night. Doctors treating them, however, said that condition of all the patients was stable and there was nothing to worry about. 
  
 City food inspector   took statement of the caterer Babu Amrut   in connection with the case. Parmar runs a catering business from Tarsali.
