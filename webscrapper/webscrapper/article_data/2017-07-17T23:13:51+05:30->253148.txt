PATNA: Buoyed by the support and casting of votes by 132 BJP-led NDA and JD(U) MLAs in favour of their choice presidential candidate  , there was a renewed demand on Monday for deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s resignation. The RJD combine accounted for 110 MLAs in the 243-member assembly that requires the support of 122 MLAs to form the government. 

 Given the backdrop, third time JD(U) MLA from Barharia in Siwan district, Shyam Bahadur Singh said either Tejashwi should resign on his own or CM Nitish Kumar would sack him. Singh also said RJD chief Lalu Prasad has put Nitish in an embarrassing situation by installing his two sons, Tej Pratap and Tejashwi, as ministers.
 
 “It does not look nice to see Lalu’s two children sitting next to Nitish,” Singh said, alleging that the RJD chief has always been “putting pressure” on the CM in matters of transfer and posting.
 
 Incidentally, since the CBI raided the premises of Lalu, his wife and former CM Rabri Devi and Tejashwi, among others, after registering an FIR in what is known as “railway hotels for land deal” case on July 5, the JD(U) functionaries have attacked Lalu and Tejashwi for the latter’s refusal to resign on his own, but it was for the first time that a JD(U) MLA made such a scathing remark on Lalu and his family. Observers feel that Nitish, when playing political chess, knocks down the most important rival with his ‘pyaadaas’ (pawns).
 
 Earlier, after casting his vote, Tejashwi again maintained that the CBI FIR was a conspiracy and the demand for his resignation was more of a “media head” than anything else. He also said, “BJP believes in negative politics and dividing society and the RJD is committed to defeating its designs to maintain social harmony.”
 
 Also, former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who is an MLC, told media persons that “Tejashwi will have to resign”.
 
 Incidentally, Nitish, who is also a member of the legislative council, did not visit the assembly premises.
