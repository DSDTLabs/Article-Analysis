On cashless system, 60% of traders admitted that it would have no adverse impact on their business,” Singh said.
 
 The UP Election Watch also informed that the survey was conducted on 30 assembly seats in 10 divisions of UP namely Jhansi, Banda, Kanpur, Lucknow, Meerut, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Allahabad, Agra and Bareilly.
