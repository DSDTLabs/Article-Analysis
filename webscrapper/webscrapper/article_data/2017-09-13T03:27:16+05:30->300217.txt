NOIDA: Three   workers were admitted to hospital after falling unconscious while cleaning a   in Sector 52 on Tuesday afternoon. 

  officials said the workers were privately engaged to clean a septic tank behind house D-52, not by the Authority.
 
 The workers were identified as   (30), Swaraj (32) and Vinod (31). Rajveer Singh, in-charge of Sector 52 police check post, said as the workers could not come out the manhole, locals suspected foul play and informed the police about the matter. “The police team reached the spot within a couple of minutes and started the rescue operation,” he said.
 
 He said that Swaraj first went in. “When he did not respond to calls from his co-workers, Vinod entered the tank to rescue him. But Vinod too fell unconscious. Later Sanjay entered the tank, but he too failed in his attempt,” Singh said.
 
 Swaraj and Vinod were completely unconscious while Sanjay was dizzy when they were rescued. They were immediately rushed to the district hospital in Sector 30. They are now out of danger.
 
 Dr Anurag Bhargav, GB Nagar CMO, said: “They fell unconscious due to asphyxiation. The oxygen level in their body was very low.” 
 
 Police said the workers were cleaning the tank without wearing any protection gear. R K Mishra, ACEO of Noida Authority, said, “They were employed by a private individual. We urge people to approach the Authority before they engage such workers. We will ensure they follow safety norms.”
