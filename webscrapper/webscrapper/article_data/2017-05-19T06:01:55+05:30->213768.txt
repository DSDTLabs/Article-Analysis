 “In view of the general trend of involving residents in maintenance of local urban amenities, maintenance of community centres can be best handled by associations of local residents. 
 
 To make this into a self-sustaining activity, the task of maintenance would have to accompany allocation of revenues for maintenance purposes,” Umashankar said.

 The association has to ensure there is no misuse of the centre.
