NOIDA: If you are travelling on the   and using your mobile phone you will be in for a shock. The traffic police have decided to issue   to violators for using mobile phones and not wearing seatbelts while driving. The move aims to curb traffic violations on the 24-km expressway, which is equipped with sophisticated technology under the highway traffic management system (HTMS).

 At present e-challans are issued only for speeding which is captured by 132 cameras installed on the median of the expressway from Mahamaya Flyover to Pari Chowk. These high-resolution cameras catch traffic violators and also people parking their vehicles along the e-way. The traffic enforcement officials then issue e-challans to the violators at their address with a photograph as proof. The violators need to pay the challan to the SP traffic’s office or in court.
 
 The Noida-Greater Noida expressway has 62 fixed cameras, 31 movable cameras and 24 speed catcher cameras. Besides, 15 cameras are used to catch violators for parking by the roadside and also people driving on the wrong side.
 
 Anil Kumar Jha, SP (traffic) GB Nagar, said the new enforcement rule would be in place very soon. “We will launch the plan after modification in the format of challan system. The camera catches violators and generates photographs. Owing to the high resolution, the drivers can also be seen clearly if they are talking the on phone or not using seatbelts. The enforcement will surely check traffic violations on the expressway,” he said.
 
 The officials said the cameras and systems are already in place and they just need to introduce some changes in the format to start the new scheme. The traffic police are also in talks with the   officials for its implementation.
 
 A total of 11,338 e-challans were sent for speeding last year through the HTMS. From January to April this year, 6,954 violators have been fined. In the first four months of 2016, the HTMS had issued a total of 3,586 challans.
