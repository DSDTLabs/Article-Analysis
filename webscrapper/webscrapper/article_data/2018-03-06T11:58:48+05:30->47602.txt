VISAKHAPATNAM: The   ( ) has preliminarily decided to form special purpose vehicle ( ) for all its major projects in future, considering their earlier bitter experience with other initiatives like the Harita project among others.

 Talking to reporters on Monday, Vuda vice-chairman Basanth Kumar said opting for the SPV mode for execution of projects will limit their liability to their equity in the project, thereby insulating Vuda from the unending claims.
 
 “For example, an allottee had approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which ruled in favour of the allottee. However, we managed to get a stay on the order from the  . About 50 other allottees, without knowing about the stay order from the apex court, gave us notices based on the NCDRC’s orders for compensation,” he said.
 
 “We will now either move the Supreme Court to prevent all future claims in any forum, or inform the allottees about the stay order in reply to their notices. Considering these experiences, we have now decided to go for SPV for all future projects. Vuda will be insulated through the SPV model,” added Basanth Kumar.
 
 He further said chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had finalised the   redevelopment design, which is estimated to cost Vuda around Rs 30 crore. “The chief minister made several suggestions with regards to the proposed botanical garden project design. He asked us to include the proposal of developing high-end villas, golf course, and a chain of hotels as part of the project. Andhra Pradesh Urban Greening and Beautification Corporation is helping us with these two projects,” said Basanth Kumar.
 
 Vuda chief engineer V Chandraiah explained about the progress of the NAD flyover project. “The design vetting process will be completed in the next one week and work will start once the process is over,” said Chandraiah. Vuda chief urban planner   and others were present at the press meet.
