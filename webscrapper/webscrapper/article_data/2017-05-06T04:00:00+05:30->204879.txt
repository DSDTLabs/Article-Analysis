Surat: Last mile connectivity is the key to success of mass transport. Surat is a city of 50 lakh and if 5 lakh people start using mass transport, it will help reduce congestion. But, for that to happen, the city needs good connectivity which is missing at present.

 Dinesh Vaghela, an employee at the district collectorate, lives in Vesu. There is no mass transport for him to reach his office from home. Therefore, he is compelled to use his own vehicle. Surat city has more than 2,300km of roads and more than 60% people drive only cars. 
 
 In all, the civic body has planned 50 routes of the city buses, including feeder routes to connect different parts of Surat with Olpad, Kadodara and Sayan. Unless this is made operational soon, passenger flow like in Surat-Kamrej section is unlikely to increase. 
 
 “SMC is looking at options like single-seated transport and auto rickshaws apart from city bus connectivity with BRTS to provide last mile connectivity to people. The civic body is also looking at providing a bus route and a stop every 500 metres from a residence in the city. This should draw at least 10% population to use mass transport in the city,” said Shivanand Swamy from Cept University, Ahmedabad. 
 
 Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “Single-ticketing system will be introduced in another two months and expansion of network further will see more and more passengers using our mass transport system. Ridership has increased to 80, 000 in BRTS buses and more than 30,000 in city buses daily in the recent months. We are confident it will increase further.”
