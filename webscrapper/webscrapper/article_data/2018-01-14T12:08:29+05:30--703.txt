Zayn Malik is ringing in his 25th birthday and   has a hilarious message for him.

  
  
 
  The singer-songwriter took to Instagram to share a video he received from Ryan, dressed as Deadpool.
 
  
  
  "Zayn, it's Wade, don't hang up. I just wanted to wish you a very happy birthday, again," Reynolds said in the video. "I also wanted to apologize for jumping out of the cake like that, I didn't realize it was the middle of the night - I had no idea it was in the middle of your bedroom".
 
  "I want to thank your security, who were very, very gentle and creative with the taser," he continued. "So, anyway, happy birthday to you and [late hockey player]  . You share your birthday with a very special Canadian, who is very dear to my heart."
 
  The two, whose partners,   and  , are both in  's squad, are apparently big fans of each other and have taken to social media to show it in the past.
