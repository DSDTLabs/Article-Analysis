PANAJI: Fearing risk of attack, Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL) suspended its buses plying on the Goa-Karnataka inter-state route. A total of 36 buses of the corporation that operate on this route stayed off road.

 The bandh was called by a group of Kannada organisations to draw PM Narendra Modi’s attention towards the issue of sharing of waters of Mhadei with Goa. There have been reports of a Goa-registration vehicle being stoned in Karnataka.
 
 Chief minister   refused to comment on the issue of the Karnataka bandh and attack on Goan vehicles. “I am the chief minister of Goa, not Karnataka,” he said. 
 
 “Operations of all 36 buses to Karnataka will resume on Friday,” KTCL chairman Carlos Almeida said. The bandh was called from 6am to 6pm during which time KTCL’s Goa to Belagavi and Mysuru buses did not ply. Its night buses, however, to Bengaluru plied at 7pm while the one to   left from the depot at 5pm. 
 
 In addition to this, 70 buses of the Karnataka state road transport corporation (KSRTC) were also suspended and their location was shifted from Kadamba bus terminus in   to Patto Plaza “for safety reasons”.
 
 Two from their fleet of 72 buses, however, did ply on Thursday morning. These were the KSRTC from Goa to Bhatkal that departured at 5.15am and the 7am bus to Kumta. Following which, the control point stationed at Panaji depot received an intimation from Belagavi not to ply the buses.
 
 “Our colleagues from Belagavi instructed us not to ply buses on the Ramnagar, Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi, Karwar, and Khanapur routes. These buses bring us a revenue of Rs 2.5 lakh per day, losses of which we had to incur due to the bandh,” said bookings in-charge, N K Shanbaug.
