LUCKNOW: In a first for the city,   will teach   to classes 9-12. Under Martiniere Aviation Club (MAC), students will be taught the basics of flying, including aeromodelling that involves assembly and flying of aircraft from April 20.

 “The aviation club is meant to encourage boys to learn the intricacies of flying an aircraft. With many volunteers to train amateur enthusiasts, the city will also be involved. The vast grounds of La Martiniere are an advantage for this exercise,” said school’s principal Carlyle McFarland.
 
 Students of class IX, with mathematics and  , can be a part of MAC. College bursar Adrian Michael, who is a qualified pilot, along with faculty Navneet, will assist the boys. “Aviation is being taught in higher education institutes. We will prepare students to pursue a career in aviation,” said Michael.
 
 He said in the first year, students would be taught the basics of flying. They would be taught aero-modelling where they would design and build scaled flying models of popular aircraft, both control line — a simple and light way of controlling a flying model — and remote-controlled versions. Parents of such children would have to sign an indemnity bond, he added.
 
 Michael said prominent people of the city who pursue it as a hobby have come forward and offered their time to train the boys. He said the college is in the process of associating with   to give students an actual flying experience in a Cessna 152 aircraft. The aircraft is used primarily for flight training or for personal use. This module would include ground studies for the issue of a student pilot licence and a radio telephony operators’ licence, he added.
 
 The college is also in talks with a leading airline to open a channel for the shortlisted students who aspire to take up flying as a career. If all goes well, aspirants would be inducted in the airline’s cadet programme and on clearing the course, they would be assured of flying an Airbus A320.
