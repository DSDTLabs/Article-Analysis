Starting from  , to the cult hit Om and now Bangaara s/o Bangarada Manushya, many of Shivarajkumar’s big-ticket films have released on the 19th, which seems to be the actor’s lucky number. What’s even more interesting is that Om, which is even now being re-released in theatres that run to packed houses, was released on May 19, 1995, and 22 years later,   is all set to hit screens on May 19. So, will history repeat itself, and will this film enjoy the same cult following as Om? Only time will tell.
