THANE: A high-level committee of the state-unit of BJP will meet at Thane next week. The conclave, a part of its routine three month review meets in the state, will be attended by party MLAs, MLCs, MPs and ministers. The issue of forging an alliance with its traditional ally, the  , is also likely to be discussed, say activists.

 The BJP state executive committee is likely to gauge the mood of its activists and foot soldiers ahead of the civic polls in Thane and Mumbai before taking a decision on continuing its alliance with the Shiv Sena or not at the meeting.
 
 "The mood at the ground level in the party is upbeat especially after the several tough but development oriented initiatives launched at the centre and the state. The party activists here feel the response to demonetization has also been good and could help brighten the prospects of the party at the civic elections," says a party activist.
 
 The conclave will be attended by party MLAs, MLCs, MPs and ministers at state. Office-bearers, only those above the rank of district president will attend.
 
 "Our party leaders have taken some innovate and tough decisions ever since we came in power in the country and state. The Sena that has been ruling the city since last several decades has done nothing for the development of the party. We would want our party to fight the polls solo on our development issues instead of allying with the Sena," said a party worker from the city.
