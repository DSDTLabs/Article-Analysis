ITANAGAR: Denouncing the latest attack on a member of the press fraternity in the state, media organizations in Arunachal Pradesh have expressed their anger over such incidents. 

 On the intervening night of July 6 and 7,  , associate editor of an English daily, was assaulted by miscreants while he was returning home after completing work near the capital unit office of BJP . 
 
 "The nature of the job is such that most print media journalists and employees often work till late into the night and return home well after 11 pm," said a joint statement issued by media organizations. 
 
 The press bodies' concerns were amplified by the fact that the incident took place just next to the civil secretariat where security personnel are posted round the clock.
