Actress  , who was last seen on ' ', is making the most of her free time. After quitting the show, she spent time working out and following a strict diet. The result? She has lost eight kilos and her baby fat. 

 In fact, the petite and bubbly-girl-next-door is glowing these days and looks nothing like she did on her previous daily soap. “I was happy in my skin and didn’t feel the need to get in shape. Of course, a few people from the industry would pull my leg, calling me chubby but that didn’t upset me,” the actress says, adding, “I never found the time to work on myself since I was busy shooting for my show. However, after I quit, I had some free time and working out gave me a different high altogether. I practised a mix of yoga and functional training, and religiously followed a diet plan. When I started out, weight loss was not my goal, but I began to enjoy the new me and decided to exercise even harder. I have lost eight kilos over the last few months, and I don’t plan to stop anytime soon. I’ve never felt this good.”
