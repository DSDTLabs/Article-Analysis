BENGALURU: An 18-year-old  , who suffered from a   for 10 years, has got a new lease of life.

 After undergoing a   in November 2017 at  , Whitefield, Ezzaz Ahmed is back to his normal routine and is attending college.
 
 Ezzaz fell from a bicycle when he was eight years old. Though he was given primary treatment to fix the broken elbow, it only led to further complications. The boy suffered from deformity and instability of the left elbow. With the broken bone not being realigned, he developed a condition called Cubitus Varus, a deformity of a limb in which part of it is deviated towards the midline of the body. As a result, his left upper limb became disfigured and functionally impaired, affecting his daily activities.
 
 The boy could neither ride a cycle nor lift any object with his  . He consulted many doctors in his hometown but no avail. While his right hand was normal, his left elbow was moving away from the body and the left palm towards the midline.
 
 Dr Kumardev Arvind Rajamanya, the orthopaedic surgeon who operated on Ezzaz at Manipal Hospital, said the boy suffered as the initial treatment he received was not up to the mark. In many cases, if a common fracture among children isn’t treated properly, it can create complications, hampering their everyday life, he added. “We shouldn’t accept treatment that isn’t satisfactory, but not all parents would be aware of it,” he said, adding that corrective cosmetic surgery also holds hope for such patients.
 
 “I am able to use my left hand as freely as my right hand, and can ride a vehicle too,” Ezzaz told TOI .
