MUMBAI: A 55-year-old farmer Bhairunath Jadhav attempted to commit suicide outside a minister's office in   on Wednesday.

 He consumed pesticide and security personnel at the Mantralya took him to St George Hospital. Jadhav is in ICU and his condition stated to be stable. The Marine Drive police has deployed security outside the ward and not allowing anyone to interact with him. Jadhav is from   of Maharashtra and reportedly came Mantralya to request the minister to waive his loan.
 
 In June Devendra Fadnavis-led   has announced a major loan waiver package of Rs 34,000 crore.
 
 The government waived loans of up to Rs 1.5 lakhs completely. And those farmers who have paid back their loans regularly, promised to get 25 per cent loan return benefit.
 
 But the government's ambitious loan waiver scheme has left out the weakest section of farmers in the state.
