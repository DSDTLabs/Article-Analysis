Mumbai:  , mostly breach of lane discipline leading to loss of control over vehicles, is a major reason for accidents on the   and responsible for traffic jams, especially during weekends, say traffic experts associated with the Expressway maintenance and monitoring.

 The left lane is for heavy vehicles and the middle one for smaller vehicles such as cars and SUVs while the right lane is meant for faster vehicles. In case of a breakdown, vehicles are expected to move to the shoulder to avoid blocking traffic. However, many vehicles remain stationary on one of the three lanes, resulting in speeding vehicles ramming them, experts say. 
 
 Besides, heavy vehicles often ply on the right or middle lanes, blocking smaller vehicles. Similarly, cars often go on the left lane, posing threats of accidents. As a result, most of the accidents on the expressway involve cars (39%) and trucks (32 %)
 
 “Most of the accidents can be attributed to poor lane discipline, heavy vehicles and cars criss-crossing the lanes,” said an expert working with the expressway administration.
 
 The analysis of accidents by experts associated with the state road development corporation ( ) suggests loss of control on vehicle and hitting stationary vehicles caused most accidents. “Around 75% of the accidents are due to human error. There is a need to learn defensive driving. Training and counselling of young drivers is a must,” said a senior official with highway safety patrol.
