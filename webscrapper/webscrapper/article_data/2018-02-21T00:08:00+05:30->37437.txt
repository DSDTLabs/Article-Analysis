The world-renowned   is underway in Shravanabelagola, and the 57-foot statue of Bahubali is the cynosure of all eyes. Also drawing limelight is the 15-foot   (ornamental umbrella) that stands tall over Bahubali, the credit for making which goes to Govardhan, a metal works company in  . “We had also made the Chatratraya for the 2006 Mahamastakabhisheka. Impressed by our craft, the   Mutt contacted us commissioned the work for this year’s festivities as well,” says Shiva Prasad, the proprietor.
Shiva and his team have worked on many temples in South Kanara, including Dharmasthala and Kukke Subramanya. “But this is by far our biggest project and one that demands a lot of dedication and commitment. The mutt officials got in touch with us in October and gave us the details,” adds Shiva. Weighing 4.5 tonnes in 2006, the Chatratraya’s weight was reduced to 1.25 tonnes this year, owing to its sleek design. “Swamiji was in regular touch with us. He specifically told us to ensure that no wind gets trapped in the Chatratraya since the windy situation atop the hill and the regular movement of VIPs in helicopters could bring down the umbrella,” he tells us.
 
 The Chatratraya structure has been fabricated in stainless-steel tubes and encased with copper mesh to ensure smooth passage of air. Ornamental works have also been done, along with gold-plated embellishments. “It is three-tiered and the lower layer is 18-feet wide, while the middle and the top are 12 feet and nine feet, respectively. The kalasha is made of pure gold,” says Shiva.
 Assembling the Chatratraya at the venue was a feat in itself. “Shravanabelagola is a heritage site and the Archaeology Department does not permit any kind of drilling work, as it could damage the statue of Bahubali. So, we manually carried the structure to the venue and fixed it without any kind of welding,” adds Shiva Prasad. — Madhu Daithota
