BHOPAL: A day after Mungaoli and Kolaras bypoll results, leader of the opposition   took a dig at the ruling BJP. He said that chief minister   and state BJP chief   are only consoling themselves by claiming that   won the two assembly seats "by slender margins". 

 He said, "The BJP deployed 17 ministers, legislators, spent Rs 100 crore and chief minister Chouhan constantly camped and campaigned in the two assembly seats. Yet BJP lost the bypolls. Instead of reviewing the situation, the ruling party is insulting people's verdict."
 
 Ajay Singh said that much before the model code of conduct came into force, the chief minister visited Mungaoli and Kolaras 18 times and made announcements and inaugurations worth Rs 1,500 crore. "The manner in which the BJP contested the two assembly bypolls it seemed it was fighting the assembly elections in the state," he said. "The chief minister even expanded his cabinet to include new ministers   and Jalim Singh Patel just to woo Kushwah and Lodhi voters," the LoP claimed. tnn
