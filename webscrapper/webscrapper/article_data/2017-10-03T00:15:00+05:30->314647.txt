Indore: The judicial system should show urgency in deciding pleas of abortion made by minor rape survivor, who battle with social stigma to voice their sufferings, said Nobel laureate and child right activist   on Monday. 

 “In most cases, the girls hide their pregnancy out of shame and even if they tell their parents, they hide it too. And if some survivors complain about it early, the court proceedings take much time and thereafter it becomes dangerous to terminate the pregnancy. Court should take a decision within a week,” said Sathyarthi upon his arrival in Indore as a part of his ‘Bharat Yatra’. 
 
 The campaign, which has been initiated by him from Kanyakumari on September 11, will conclude in Delhi on October 16, merging six different routes. While motivating people to raise their voices and destroy the social stigma surrounding child sexual abuse, the   aims at implementation of better laws against child trafficking. 
 
 Speaking about the efficiency of laws and policies, Satyarthi said that though Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act is a very good law, the biggest challenge is its proper implementation. “We do not have enough judicial infrastructures to handle such cases,” he added. 
 
 Satyarthi also targeted other major challenges in stopping child abuse, which is the stigma surrounding it. “The aim of the Bharat Yatra is to ensure that cases of sexual abuse are reported. Because in many cases, the accused person is a member of the family and there are no witnesses, who can testify in court,” said Satyarthi. 
 
 A rally to mark Satyarthi’s campaign in Indore will be carried out on Tuesday from Holkar Science College at 9:30 am. It will conclude at DAVV auditorium, where Satyarthi will address the gathering. A cultural programme will also be organised in the evening.
