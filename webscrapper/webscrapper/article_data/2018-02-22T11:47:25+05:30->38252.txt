TUTICORIN: Newly-elected   state secretary,  , on Wednesday appealed to the state government to place the assistant superintendent of police ( ), of   district, Selvanagarathinam under suspension for attacking and injuring party cadres who were taking part in a rally on Tuesday evening.

 Balakrishnan in a statement claimed that the party cadre were taking out a silent and peaceful procession when the police led by the ASP started attacking them without any instigation. He alleged that police purposely avoided the use of lathis and instead used wooden logs and planks used in construction.
 
 Insisting that a case be registered against the ASP and other police personnel concerned, the CPM state secretary said that stringent department and legal action should also be initiated against them. Balakrishnan said the party will organise protests across the state to condemn the attacks. Five people, including a five-year-old boy were injured in the assault with three of them suffering head injuries. Condemning the attack, Balakrishnan criticised police of being incapable of nabbing culprits involved in heinous crimes such as murder, burglary, waylaying and chainsnatching in broad daylight.
