INDORE: Bike lovers in the city had a gala time on Sunday as they witnessed over 40 international and national level bikers from across the country in a two wheeler off-road biking rally contest held at Chinaar Hills.

 The rally also saw local bikers, including five female bikers, showing off their skills.
 
 All 40 participants traversed hundreds of kilometres through Chinar hills at Rao bypass on the outskirts of the city.
 
 “Indore hardly has any adventure sports. Off-road biking is one of the latest sports that all our friends love. We recently started off-road biking and it is super fun racing with friends, except for the fact that our spines were nearly jolted out into our hands,” said  , a biker from the city who was here to enjoy the event.
 
 The race began from a hotel at Rajendra Nagar where riders were flagged off from the starting point as they traversed through tough, dusty roads to finally reach the muddy hill at Rao bypass.
 
 Many racers were seen falling and slipping on the hill while taking part in various contests but they did not lose heart and were cheered on by many Indoreans who were here to support the upcoming trend of off-roading biking in the city.
 
 The event was divided into three parts and started at 8 am. After taking part in three stages of the event and showing their excellent biking skills, P   and Aishwarya PM, both from Krishnagiri, bagged the first position in the men’s and female’s event after overall points were tallied.
 
  who loves adventure and was here with his friends said, “We are adventure freaks. We have a group of bikers and we frequently go out on bike rides along difficult routes and we are glad that off-road biking has come to Indore. The venue is also another discovery for adventure bikers in the city. The participation of female bikers is also an encouragement for female bikers in the city.”
 
 The one of a kind biking event was organised by   sports, a group of enthusiastic bikers from the city.
