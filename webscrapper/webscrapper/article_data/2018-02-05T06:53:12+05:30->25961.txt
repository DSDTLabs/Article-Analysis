AHMEDABAD: A   near Shankar Bhuvan in Shahpur on Sunday. Two   and eight tankers of the   (AFES) doused the flames after a two-and-a-half-hour operation. AFES officials suspect that the fire was caused by a   coupled with a gas leak from an LPG cylinder. No one was reported hurt but a few godowns and residences were damaged in the fire.

 Rajesh Bhatt, the additional chief fire officer, AFES, said that the challenge was the adjoining structures which delayed the identification of the source of the fire. “The residences and the shops — primarily dealing in scrap of rubber, textile, wood and paper — are intertwined and thus the spread could have been more extensive,” he said. “However, local residents were evacuated and firefighting was scaled up. The mixed-use areas pose a greater danger as seen in recent incidents.” 
 
 AFES officials also pointed out to the unsecured use of electric lines and LPG cylinders in the area. An official involved in the operation said that no fewer than five cylinders were in the area. “One of the cylinders, suspected to have developed a leak, was kept in a water container and others were removed,” said an official.
