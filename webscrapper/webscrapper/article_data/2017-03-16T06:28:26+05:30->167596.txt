 The book had a lesson on rabies in which the students are instructed to cut the head of a dog and send it for examination to check if it has rabies.
 
 The pointers while explaining what should be done after a dog bite stated, ‘If a dog bites a person, they should keep an eye on it for ten days. If the dog shows signs of rabies, his head should be cut and sent for medical examination. If the medical examination proves that it has rabies, then the injured person should be given anti-rabies shots.’
