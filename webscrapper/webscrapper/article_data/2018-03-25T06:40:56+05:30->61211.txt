KOLKATA: Two premier institutes in the city —   (CU) and Jdavpur University (JU) — have been handed over plots in   by the state for their new campuses. The varsities have also been allotted Rs 100 crore each, as promised by chief minister Mamata Banerjee in January.

 CU has decided to set up an integrated Science and Technology campus on the land. “We propose to initiate innovative research on the allotted new land and the campus will be solely dedicated for advance studies. The decision to start new courses or other allied subjects of excellence will be decided by the respective deans of science and technology,” said vicechancellor  .
 
 CU authorities are interested to do interdisciplinary research in the new campus. “We have always had a space constraint that will be solved. Moreover, path-breaking research can be conducted, high-end laboratories can be set up and modern apparatus for experiments can be purchased. Moreover, facility upgrade is the main aim in the next campus where more specimen can be preserved,” said a senior science faculty member of CU. The Syndicate will take call on the departments to be shifted there.
 
 JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, on the other hand, has decided to set up a committee of stakeholders to decide on what is to be done on the fourth campus. “Expansion scope does not exist on the old campus. Thus, the new campus has the scope for housing future programmes based on excellence of university. Also, departments that have acute space crunch could be shifted to Rajarhat and major future projects that will be bagged by JU too may find space,” said a senior engineering faculty teacher.
 
 Both the varisities will submit the detailed project report soon.
