NAGPUR: The fear of serial   again returned after a 30-year-old domestic help was attacked by an unidentified biker wearing a black helmet at   lane on Sunday. Though this time the attacker did not stab the woman, he left her in pain after twisting her hand. The modus operandi left the cops questioning whether it was the same serial stabber behind the attack. 

 Rekha Pawar, who was going for work, is learnt to have been targeted twice. Sources from police station said Rekha had stepped out of house of Vaid family when she spotted the biker advancing towards her. She rushed back after raising an alarm. The Vaids too stepped out with Rekha trying to spot the attacker but they could not see anyone.
 
 After she left another house of Uke family, also in the same locality, that the biker zeroed in upon her. This time, she could not flee as the biker grabbed her by one hand and pulled her towards him. At this point Rekha saw the biker trying to pull something out from pocket. She raised an alarm and as some local residents came out, the biker fled. 
 
 Ajni police and crime branch reached the spot upon being told. A section of the cops claimed it may not be serial stabber as no knife was used. “The stabber did not touch anyone before,” said DCP Ravindra Singh Pardeshi.
