MUMBAI: Two flamingos with bullet   were rescued on Sunday. While a female   was found in Vikhroli, the other was brought in from Thane to the Bandra clinic of Dr Rina Dev.

 This is a clear indication of organized   of migratory birds, said Pawan Sharma of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare, a non-governmental organization which rescued the birds. “We will report this to the mangrove cell of the state forest department,” he told TOI.
 
 “The wing bone of one flamingo is fragmented at the joint and is jutting out,” said Dr Dev, adding that it will be operated soon. While the other flamingo does not seem to have any fracture, it has suffered a full tear of the muscle, she said. This bird was operated upon on Sunday evening.
 
 “Both the birds will be in a critical condition for the next three to four days,” said Dr Dev.
