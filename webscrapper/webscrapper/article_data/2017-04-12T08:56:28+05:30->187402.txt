ATTARI: On Tuesday, the oft seen revelry at the Attari international border gave way to jingoism with emotionally-charged   coming all out in support of former   officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been   in Pakistan for subversive activities.

 “Pakistan is in the habit of teasing India with various gimmicks and also keep on finding opportunities to destabilise the country using its terror machinery. It is not a gimmick this time as it is the worst form of so called ‘legal terrorism’. It is a matter of my nation’s son,” fumed Ananti Ben, 57, a visitor from Gujarat. She said earlier it was  , who was done to death in the most brutal manner in Pakistani custody and now they were after the life of Jadhav.
 
 Another visitor Ravi Gopalan from Chennai hailed Indian government’s stand for Jadhav. “Don’t worry brother, we are with you, the whole nation is standing behind you like a rock and the government is doing every possible thing for you,” he said. 
 
 Kamini Ahuja (21), a BTech student from Jabalpur, said that, “Indians can’t live with a hostile nation. Sometimes they behead our soldiers, sometimes they send terrorists to kill innocent people. The Indian government has to think on serious terms and isolate Pakistan at the international level,” she said.
