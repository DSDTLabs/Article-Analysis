PANAJI: With the incidence of   on the rise and an average of 20 cases of child abuse reported every month, Children's Rights in Goa has called for the government to make budgetary allocation for the implementation of the   (2003) that was passed in 2003 by the Manohar Parrikar-led government.

 The legislation is praised at national and international forums as a law that is unique and forward looking, but till date, most of the provisions of the legislation are yet to be implemented as successive governments have failed to make any budgetary allocation for the same, CRG pointed out. 
 
 Between April 2014 and July 2015, 324 cases of child abuse were reported in the state. The number of child beggars is only increasing and only a handful of village child committees have been set up, but implementation of the Goa Children’s Act could result in building of safety nets to prevent children from being abused or exploited in any way, the   said in a press release. 
 
 “The act is unique as it provides for proactive steps to be taken by different stakeholders to make Goa a child-friendly state. It provides for health cards to every child, early intervention to detect any development disorders, gender sensitisation and awareness of rights in all schools,” CRG said.
