  On Sunday, a large number of teachers gathered at   in the city and held the unique protest. They also said that their protest was going on for the last nine days at district inspector of school’s office (DIOS).
  
  “What we can do other than holding a protest. Previous government used to pay us for the evaluation. Now, we are getting nothing,” said  , a teacher at a local college.
  
  When contacted, DIOS   said: “There is nothing we can do. Government has to take a call on it.”
