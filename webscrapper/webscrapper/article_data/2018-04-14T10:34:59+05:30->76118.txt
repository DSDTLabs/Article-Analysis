BHOPAL: Six unidentified masked men looted money from the house of a   constable, when his wife and 10-month-old son were at home in   area of   village on city outskirts early Friday morning.

 As per police, it was around 2am, when complainant Sandhya’s husband   left home for the CISF camp.
 
 After 20 minutes, six unidentified men, some without footwear, gained entry in the house by breaking a lock on the main door and carried just one wooden stick between them.
 
 Once into the house, they began laying their hands on money. They first took out the cash from the wallet kept in the hall. Later, they entered a room where   and her infant son were sleeping. When the six looters barged into the room, Sandhya woke up.
 
 Seeing them she got scared and attempted to shout for help, but the intruders gagged her mouth.
 
 The looters first threatened her and asked her to give all valuables she had, but she refused.
 
 The looters then allegedly tried to pick up her kid and threatened her they would kill her son and her husband. Sandhya removed all her jewellery, including her mangalsurtra, tops, anklet and a silver jewellery her child had worn. Looters took the jewellery and cash worth Rs 15,000 and fled.
 
 The incident came to light after Sandhya called up her husband and told him about it.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sandhya said, “The looters called me ‘didi’ and asked me to give them all the jewellery. They had a stick with them and no other weapon, but when they pulled away my son, I got scared and gave them everything that I had with me.”
 
 Parvalia police station house officer Girija Shankar Mahobiya, said, “We suspect accused to be from the village itself as they knew when Deepak leaves for work and the accused called the complainant as ‘didi’ which no accused normally does.”
 
 He said, “We detained some 15 villagers for interrogation, but none of them were found to be looters. We left informers in the village and would crack the case soon.”
