LUCKNOW: This year enjoy   with as much colours and water as you wish to.   will provide   for   -- 5am to 11pm -- on the festival.

 Even areas which face water shortage due to high dependence on tubewells and groundwater supply will get uninterrupted water supply. Areas like Aliganj, Alambagh, Niralanagar, Jankipuram, and Mahanagar, which are dependent on tubewell supply, will also get 18 hours supply.

 Officials said that after 3pm, the pressure of water supply would be lowered as playing of colours gradually comes down noon onwards. “We would again increase pressure of supply from 6pm when people need water for bathing and household chores,” they added.
