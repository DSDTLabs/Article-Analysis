AHMEDABAD:   high court has reserved its verdict after it concluded hearing on appeals filed in the 2002 Ode massacre case in which 23 persons were killed in the town in   in central Gujarat.

 In this case, 23 people were convicted by a special investigation team (SIT) court in 2012 for killing 23 persons. The court had sentenced 18 convicts to life imprisonment for criminal conspiracy and murder.
 
 The state government had sought death sentence for 18 convicts. The government also sought enhancement in punishment awarded to five others.
 
 The violence had taken place on March 1, 2002, at   in Ode town. After violent mobs attacked members of the minority community, 23 of them, mainly women and children, took shelter in a house which was set on fire after bolting doors from outside.
 
 All 23 convicts had also challenged their conviction before the high court.
 
 In the second incident at Ode, three persons were killed at   area on the same day, and nine people were given life terms for whom too the government wanted death sentence. There was a third incident of violence in the town, an old man was killed, but the case did not see any conviction.
 
 All the three cases reached the HC. The government, the SIT and the victims had challenged the acquittal of 53 people in two cases – Piriwali Bhagol and Malav Bhagol.
 
 The case always remained in news because six accused persons in the Malav Bhagol case fled abroad after jumping bail. It was only after the SIT court delivered its verdict, they were traced in different countries – US, UK and Australia. Five of them were brought to India and put on trial. Four have been acquitted, with one Samit Patel being acquitted last week.
