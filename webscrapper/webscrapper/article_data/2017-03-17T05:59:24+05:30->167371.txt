LUCKNOW: Is BSP chief Mayawati’s decision to resort to agitation against   and accusing it of storming to power in UP by tampering with EVMs a way to keep her floundering cadre organised? Despite a stinging defeat in the recent assembly polls and Election Commission of India’s rebuttal on EVMs being rigged,   has geared up to take the battle to streets. Mayawati has been meeting her party’s grass root workers while directing them to agitate at all district headquarters of UP on 11th of every month—to coincide with the date of declaration of UP election results, March 11.

 The issue cropped up during a marathon meeting of   workers with Mayawati here, in which, sources said she asked them to “remain united” for a bigger battle ahead. There is a plan for agitation on April 11.
 
 Sources said the party is going to move a petition in court against the ECI to “keep the issue alive and provide an objective for the party cadre,’’.
 
 Mayawati also decided to keep intact the party’s ‘Bhaichara committees’ which she disbanded after every election to prepare ground for next elections. Sources said Mayawati is has an uphill task to keep her disenchanted flock together. BSP old timers including former finance minister K K Gautam and Mayawati’s OSD (when she was CM) Gangaram Ambedkar have resigned from the party. Mayawati has been facing threat of her core Dalit and MBC vote bank being usurped by the BJP. Political experts pointed out how she invoked Kanshiram to woo the two communities during and after poll results.
