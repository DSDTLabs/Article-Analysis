KOLKATA: After the heavy downpour last week, there is a lull, and it will continue for a few more days with the Met office predicting only sporadic rain the city. There is no major weather system currently that will trigger heavy rain for now.

 “We expect light to moderate rain in the city for now. The monsoon trough currently is passing through Malda and hence there will be more rain in North Bengal and less rain in South Bengal,” said GK Das, director (weather) at   Kolkata.
 
 According to meteorologists July and August are the most active months in terms of rainfall during the monsoon. The normal monthly rain for July for Kolkata is 331 mm. But this July the city has received around 80% surplus rain.
 
 The past two days the rain has been localized and sporadic. This the Met office says is because the showers are due to local thunder cell formation. A strong system like a depression only causes widespread heavy rain.
