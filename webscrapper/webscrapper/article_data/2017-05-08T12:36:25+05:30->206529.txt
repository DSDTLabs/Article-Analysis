There's no doubt that   has got an amazing fashion sense. Itâ€™s unique, eccentric and something, not everyone can pull off. And she proved this yet again with her recent look at UNICEF Gala in South Africa. 
The actress wore a dotted black sari with a gorgeous border but what stunned everyone was her hand-painted blouse. She gave a quirky touch to her look by opting for a blouse with Bengal Tiger painted on it. Mind it, the tiger was not a regular graphic print!
  
  
 
 The ensemble was designed by Sabyasachi, and we loved how she kept accessories to a bare minimum. Priyanka had a choice to flaunt a gown, dress or something else at this prestigious event, but she made us all proud by opting for this regal outfit.
 You go, girl!
