Surat: The Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA) has urged the central GST authorities to issue a circular on the revised decision on e-way bill by GST Council in Hindi language.  Fostta office-bearers said there are clear directions in the circular issued by CGST that the consignment below Rs50,000 does not require e-way bill. The e-way bill is required on the consignment above Rs50,000.  However, many small and medium textile traders in the city are facing difficulties sending consignments below Rs50,000 value as transporters are forcing them to generate e-way bill.  According to Fostta office-bearers, the transporters do not want to take risk with the consignment moving to other states as the GST officers are not allowing goods without e-way bill.  Fostta secretary Champalal Bothra said, “More than 95% of people associated with this trade are unable to interpret the decision by the GST Council in a correct manner. Hence, we have demanded that the circular be issued in Hindi language, so that it reaches all stakeholders and help them clear the misunderstanding.”
