Pune: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has imposed a collective fine of over Rs 6.17 crore on six firms for “bid-rigging” and “collusive bidding” in the online tendering process for installing wet garbage processing plants worth Rs 15 crore in Pune city during 2014-15. The six firms bagged the work order issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). In its May 2 order, the office of the director-general, CCI, said it had found evidence that the PMC had failed to detect “cartelisation” in its own tenders. “It is clear from the investigation that the PMC did not exercise due diligence while scrutinising the bid documents,” it said. The CCI, the country’s fairplay watchdog, lists evidence against the PMC in its order such as uploading of online tenders from the same IP address, call data records of communication between some officials of the PMC with the bidders and other systemic failures on the part of the corporation to indicate that the PMC may have facilitated bid-rigging.
