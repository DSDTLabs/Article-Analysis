NAGPUR: The geometric shapes drawn with a pen and black ink on a white canvas express the disenchantment of artist   with the digital world. “In this era of superfast communication, we have actually got cut away from everybody in terms of feelings and emotions,” says Babar who heads the painting department at CISFA. His works are on display at the   gallery under the title ‘Mark’.

 The 35 paintings done in mixed media, that includes acrylic colours and Japanese black ink, have been created to show the starkness of human emotions and relationships which the artist says are in turmoil. “I always feel that the era of writing letters kept us very close as we exchanged our feelings and thoughts with our near dear ones,” he says.
 
 The concept behind the series is nostalgia he says. “Moving away from huge homes to individual flats, the every rising trend of e-schools and this habit of remaining alone with our digital devices even when we are in company are depicted here,” says Shareef explaining his works which fall under the genre of conceptual art.
 
 The 15 smaller framed paintings which occupy one wall of the gallery also show the breaking away of a part from the whole. “This is about search of one’s individuality for which there is a need to cut away from our roots,” he says.
 
 The entire work on display has also been exhibited at   in Mumbai and, at   and AIFAC Delhi. “My friends here feel that my work should also be shown at the place where I create it,” he says. “I got good footfalls too as the exhibition began when the craft mela was on at the SCZCC, many showed interest in the work.”
 
 Ruing the lack of sales not just in city but outside too, Shareef says, “The cost of creating a painting has gone up but I have to continue doing it to remain in circulation. An artist is recognized by his art. Whether I earn from it or not is another matter.”
