Hoon Chandrakant Bakshi is based on life of eminent and stalwart writer of gujarati literature Chandrakant Bakshi, whereas Mohan no Masalo is the recipe of how Mohandas Gandhi became Mahatma Gandhi. Both the plays were performed by well known actor Pratik Gandhi and directed by Manoj Shah.
 Both the shows got amazing response from people.
