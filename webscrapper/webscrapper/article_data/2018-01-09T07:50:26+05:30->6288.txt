KOLKATA: As of now,   cannot pull the plugs off its feed to multi-system operator ( )   that takes cable channels to 12 lakh homes in Kolkata and another 23 lakh homes in rest of the state. At the same time, SitiCable has to immediately pay Rs 5 crore to Star India and another Rs 5 crore within a fortnight.

 While the order will allow a few thousand SitiCable homes that have begun subscribing Star channels separately to continue enjoying their daily diet of Bengali and Hindi soap on Star Jalsha and Star Plus, lakhs of homes who view channels in package format will continue to miss out Star channels as SitiCable has removed them from its bouquet from the end of December 2017 following the dispute. 
 
 Hearing the allegations and counter allegations on the disconnection notice issued by Star India to SitiCable citing non-payment of dues and disallowing subscriber audit, the Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) asked Star India not to disconnect the feed till the case is decided. Star India had threatened to withdraw Star channels from SitiCable from January 10. 
 
 TDSAT also asked SitiCable to pay Rs 10 crore in two tranches while recognising that SitiCable did not have any history of payment default. A SitiCable official viewed Monday's development as a vindication of its demand that it be allowed to sell channels a la carte.
 
 However, negotiations between the two parties continue with Star India demanding a 110% high in fixed fees for inducting its channels into SitiCable packages and the latter refusing to relent. 
 
 Star India is one of the largest broadcasters in the country with 64 channels across genres like general entertainment, news, movies, infotainment, food, lifestyle and sports in eight languages.
