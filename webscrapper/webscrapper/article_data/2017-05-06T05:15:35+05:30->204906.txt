NEW DELHI: Left parties and members of the civil socie ty came together on Friday to label the   government in   “fascist“, accusing it of for cibly acquiring land in Bhangar in South 24 Parganas district. The land is being acquired for a power grid project helmed by the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL).

 Accusing the   of “unleashing unprecedented“ terror in the 16 villages affected by the project, the group called for a mass movement against the acquisition, starting with a protest march on May 8 and a public hearing, to be chaired by retired justice A  , in Bhangar on May 20 and 21. 
 
 The Left parties and civil rights groups have demanded a judicial probe into the death of two villagers in a clash with the police in January this year, as well as the release of other protesters, largely farmers, who have been booked under `draconian' laws such as UAPA. Civil rights group People's Union for Civil Liberties along with other groups is part of the call for mass movement.
