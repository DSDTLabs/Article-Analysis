PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited on Monday increased the fine amount from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 for its drivers who are found talking on the cellphone while driving. It also restarted the scheme of rewarding citizens who send photographs of the erring drivers. 

 Subhash Gaikwad, PRO,  , said the fine amount would be deducted from the salary of the driver. Citizens can send the photographs to: tmope@pmpml.org. Half of the fine amount will be given to the complainant.
 
 The system of accepting pictures from citizens was stopped last year by former PMPML CMD Tukaram Mundhe after it was found out that only a certain set of people were sending the photographs. “However, we don’t want to encourage habitual complainants and, hence, each complaint will be looked into carefully,” another official said. 
 
  The complainant will have to furnish related information like the time and the day on which the photo was clicked , the location and the bus number. “The information will be matched with the PMPML’s intelligent traffic management system (ITMS). If the information is found to be correct, the fine will be imposed, but if it is wrong, the PMPML will file a police complaint against the sender,” the official told TOI. 
 
 Accidents involving PMPML buses are common. Recent figures provided by PMP Pravasi Manch show that from April 27, 2018, to May 7, 2018, as many as 25 people died in road accidents involving PMPML buses.
