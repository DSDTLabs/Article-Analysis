NEW DELHI: A 37-year-old imposter was arrested on Monday at Safdarjung Hospital for trying to pass off as a senior doctor. 

 The man, Avinash Anand, had claimed ot be an associate professor at AIIMS Trauma Center in the orthopaedics department and had forced resident doctors at Safdarjung to admit patients. 
 
 He had even pulled out a fake identity card and was found carrying forged stamps. 
 
 Police said Anand had been fleecing patients at both Safdarjung and AIIMS by posing as a doctor affiliated to either. 
 
 He told the police during questioning that he was a PhD in yoga and had visited Safdarjung to meet a patient from his village. 
 
 “We are verifying the allegations of the hospital and the man is being questioned. No case has been registered as of now,” said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP II (south). 
 
 “Last Saturday, Anand brought a patient to my OPD and requested for admission. He said there weren’t enough beds in AIIMS so he had brought him here. 
 
 “When started talking about the patient’s course of treatment, he started floundering. On suspicion, I asked him how many bones a human body has. He couldn’t answer. That was when we got proof of his impersonation,” said Dr Balvinder Singh, assistant professor (orthopaedics), Safdarjung Hospital. 
 
 The patient was, however, admitted even as the Safdarjung doctors tried to verify if there was such a doctor at AIIMS. When the search result was negative, they asked the patient to call Anand. When he came, they got him arrested. 
 
 Singh said many bank deposit slips were also seized from Anand.
