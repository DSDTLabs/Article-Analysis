KOCHI: After being closed for almost two years,   was thrown open to the public on New Year, with planting of golden shower tree saplings and releasing of white doves symbolically to mark the beginning of a new spell for the historic ground. 

 The ground that was turned into a stage for laser show in 2014, had become an unused   after the laser show became non-operational within a year of its commencement.
 
 "The maidan is an inalienable part of the public life of Kochi. This ground was the venue for numerous protest meets during the freedom struggle and was witness to several orations that were delivered for boosting the morale of public. The maidan, which is named after a martyr of freedom struggle, is still alive with the memory of those brave freedom fighters," said  , who opened the ground to the public ata gathering in the ground. C N  , Greater Cochin Development Authority chairman, addressing the gathering, said, "We are planning to set up a permanent podium for delivering speeches which will be open to anyone to talk on any subject of preference. Measures to preserve the historical significance of the site will be taken, apart from beautification of the maidan."
 
  He said recreation and toilet facilities will also be set up at the ground, apart from attempting to revive the laser show that became dysfunctional. 
 
 "The laser show was set up here flouting the government's instruction to not use the GCDA fund for the same. We will be looking into reviving the show by roping in technical experts however," Mohanan said.
