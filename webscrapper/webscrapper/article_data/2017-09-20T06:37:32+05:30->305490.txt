However, even after their installation, Narsaiah committed two more offences at the KBR park.

 Finally cops in plainclothes were deployed to nab the offender. On Tuesday , some walkers alerted police about the man with features matching the sketch, moving suspiciously . A police team immediately reached the park and nabbed Narsaiah. “Initially, he tried to mislead our men by claiming that he was an engineering student, but later during interrogation, confessed to have committed seven chain snatching offences at the park,“ the DCP said.
