NEW DELHI: Working on the directions of a monitoring committee appointed the Supreme Court,   carried out a sealing drive in   on Friday.

 Over 50 commercial establishments, comprising 200 shops, offices, showrooms and hotels at Kishangarh village were sealed by the south corporation. 
 
 According to   officials, the sealing drive has been initiated against these establishments for illegal use of DDA land for decades. South corporation had recently sealed over 70 shops in Chhatarpur area for misuse of agriculture land for running commercial activities.

 The sealed properties included showrooms of Hyundai, TATA, Ford, Mitsubishi and Maruti Motors. A number of banquet halls, hotels, workshops, offices and other buildings were also sealed, said an official.
