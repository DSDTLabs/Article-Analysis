THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Despite multiple rules in place for checking the   which is limited for industrial and medical purposes, the excise department has not been taking a pro-active role in checking its widespread misuse.

 The Cochin Denatured  , 1965, clearly states that methyl alcohol or methylated spirits can be used only for industrial and scientific purposes. But excise department officials say that after a Supreme Court order asking the state not to intervene in the use of spirits for the use of industrial and scientific purposes, there is lesser scrutiny.
 
 As per the rules, `methylated spirit' means `denatured spirit rendered effectually unfit for human consumption by the admixture of crude woodnaptha.' According to the rule six, a person or organization using methyl alcohol, methylated spirit or denatured spirit, should obtain a licence from the excise department. These licences are categorised as D-1 or D-1A licence. While the D-1 licence is given for industrial and scientific purposes, the D-1A is issued for private or charitable medical purposes.
 
 But sources said that these licences are not availed by many such organizations after the Supreme Court verdict. The mishap in Kozhikode was due to use of methylated spirit and the victims had consumed Medisol, used by the hospital where one of the deceased was working. Hospitals use   for cleansing and sanitisation. The excise department has already confiscated 20 litres o0f Medisol from the hospital and handed it over to the police.
 
 Excise officials said that have held raids to confiscate spirit that is being brought from other states.“The border checkp o s t s h ave a l r e a d y b e e n strengthened. Manpower in the check-posts have been increased especially during the festival seasons,“ an official said.
