Lucknow:   chief   on Sunday accused the   government in UP of “interfering” with the lives of people and attempting to “imprison” them in the name of maintaining law and order.

 Presiding a review meeting at party headquarters here in Lucknow, Mayawati said people were not able to live freely since the state government is attempting to introduce one rule after the other and imposing them on a common man. 
 
 “There hasn't been any improvement in the lives of people in UP since BJP came to power in the state,” said the former UP CM. She also accused the BJP government at the Centre of not being considerate to the financial condition of people while imposing one tax or the other across the country. 
 
 Meanwhile, Mayawati, while addressing the party’s Bihar unit functionaries, asked them to work essentially among Dalits who stand politically marginalised in Bihar. She asked party workers to hold cadre camps and carry out missionary activities by highlighting the achievements of Dalit icons.
