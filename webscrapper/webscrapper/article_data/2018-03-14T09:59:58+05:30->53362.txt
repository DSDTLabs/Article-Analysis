NEW DELHI: The   has directed all the affiliated units of the   (IOA) and   (NSFs) to go ‘cashless'. Hold your thoughts for a minute. It isn’t that the ministry has stopped their financial grants. This move is to encourage digital payment methods among the   and NSFs’ member units to promote transparency and avoid misuse of government funds.

 
 
 
 
 In a significant development, the ministry has advised the IOA and NSFs that henceforth all the “grant-in aid/funds/payments to their affiliated units, vendors, service providers etc. for the purpose of organising tournaments/events shall be preferably done by electronic transfer directly into the account of the beneficiary”.
 
 
 
 “No grant-in aid/funds shall be transferred to the personal account of office bearers of the affiliated units and cash transactions should be avoided to the extent possible. This approach will not only promote transparency but also eliminate complaints to a larger extent,” a ministry note read.
 
 The move was necessitated after it was brought to the ministry’s notice that NSFs, while transferring grants to their affiliated units, don’t follow proper procedure. In some cases, it has led to the dispute among the IOA, NSFs and their affiliated units because of which proper audit of accounts couldn’t take place by the ministry and other investigative agencies. It also resulted in the non-maintenance of the register of assets, leading to cases of financial bungling.
 
 “Since grant-in aid is provided by the ministry to the NSFs through online transfer and no cash transactions is made, it becomes imperative that the sports bodies should also adopt same methodology,” the note added.
