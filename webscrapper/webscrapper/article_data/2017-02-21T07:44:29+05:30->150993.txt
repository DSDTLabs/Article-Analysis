HYDERABAD: The  , Hyderabad (JNTU-H), recently gave affiliated colleges an option to move to other universities, but not many colleges seem to have opted for it despite protesting earlier about stringent rules. In all, only 19 out of 176 (engineering), about 100 (MBA) and 76 pharmacy colleges under JNTU-H have applied. 

 Looking at the low numbers after the vociferous protest by colleges over JNTU-H biometric attendance system and rules on hiring professors with PhDs, registrar N Yadaiah said: "Across the globe if a student says that he is from JNTU, people recognise it. If the colleges move out, they know that there won't be much demand for them. This might be a reason." 
 
 Moreover, it appears that other universities are also not keen on taking these colleges, leaving them with little choice but to stay put. 
 
 "Many pharmacy colleges, especially the ones situated in Nalgonda district want to move out of JNTU and seek affiliation from  . But authorities at the university are not willing to take us in," admitted   president K Ramadass.
 
 As of now 7 engineering colleges, including  , have confirmed they are leaving while at least 10-15 pharma colleges are mulling to move out. 
 
 "Government should make JNTU exclusively for engineering colleges. What's the point of affiliating pharmacy colleges when it doesn't have pharma course on the campus? It would be better if MBA and pharma colleges are moved out of JNTU," said N Gautham Rao, president, Telangana Private Engineering and Professional Colleges Managements Association.
 
 Yadaiah, meanwhile, said that the university has sent guidelines about the change in affiliation to the state government and is awaiting reply.
