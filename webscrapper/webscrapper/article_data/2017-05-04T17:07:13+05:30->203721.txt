NEW DELHI: Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, or so they say. Last month, when executive chairman of the  ,  , was tweeted a picture of an auto-rickshaw that had been modified to resemble a   SUV from the rear, he seemed quite impressed. The industrialist had then asked his team and also reached out through   with an appeal to help locate the owner of the auto-rickshaw, with a promise to gift the person a four-wheeler.

 Now, Mahindra has proved that he lives up to his word. After the company tracked down the rickshaw owner - a Kerala-based auto rickshaw driver named Sunil - Mahindra presented a brand new   to the creative auto-wallah. Not only that, Sunil's 'iconic' auto-rickshaw has been inducted into the Mahindra museum.
 
 He also posted a photo of Sunil, with the auto and his new Supro Mini Truck.
 
 
  
 
 "Remember this request? Our team managed to locate him! And we acquired the three-wheeler from him. Gave him a four-wheeler in return. Here's Sunil, the proud owner of the three-wheeler 'Scorpio', now a happy owner of a four-wheeler," Mahindra tweeted on Wednesday.
 
  
 
 This fateful sequence of events began on March 19, 2017, when a man named Anil Panickar had found the picture of the auto-rickshaw and tagged Anand Mahindra, telling him how popular the Scorpio had become among the Indian crowd. Mahindra had thanked Panickar for bringing the vehicle to his notice and even requested his help in locating the auto-rickshaw owner, so he could acquire his customised ride and gift him a four-wheeler in return.
