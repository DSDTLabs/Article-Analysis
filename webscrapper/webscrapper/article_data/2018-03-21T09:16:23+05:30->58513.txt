CHENNAI: Allies Congress and DMK sparred over whom to credit for getting the classical language status for Tamil in the state assembly on Tuesday. 

 It started when   H Vasanthkumar, during question hour, thanked Congress president   for getting the classical language status for Tamil. Reacting to this, leader of opposition M K Stalin intervened and said it was former Congress president   and former Prime Minister   who were responsible for getting the classical language status for Tamil. "It was only due to Rahul Gandhi, Tamil received the classical language status," said Vasanthkumar, while listing out various achievements of the UPA government at the centre.
 
 DMK chief whip R Sakkarapani was seen drawing Stalin's attention and he intervened after seeking permission from speaker P Dhanapal. "The Congress member says it was Rahul Gandhi, but it was due to the steps taken by Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh that Tamil language got the classical status," Stalin said.
