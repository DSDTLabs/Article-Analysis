NEW DELHI: Nine   bars, worth nearly Rs 3 crores, were recovered from a washroom at the Indira Gandhi International ( ) airport by the Central Industrial Security Force ( ) in an unattended laptop bag.

 CISF officials say the recovery took place around 11.55pm on Wednesday night, after the surveillance and intelligence team received a tip-off. An unattended bag was discovered in a men’s washroom near the international transfer area at Terminal-3.
 
 “A physical check of the bag was carried out after the bomb detection squad cleared it. We recovered nine gold bars weighing 1 kg each. The gold has been handed over to Customs department,” said a CISF official.
 
 Customs officials suspect the gold was likely left behind by a passenger to be picked up by another so it could be smuggled in.   footage will be reviewed further to track down the passenger. Leaving behind gold has been a common modus operandi for smugglers in the past.
 
 A similar seizure was made last month when gold was discovered in a toilet at IGI, which had been covered with black paper. “CCTV footage will be checked now and the investigation is ongoing. The recovered value of the gold is around Rs 2.8 crores,” said a customs official.
