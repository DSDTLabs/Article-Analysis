There is no doubt that   is one of the fittest stars in the business. The hunk will soon be seen in action showing off his martial arts skills in the upcoming film ‘Junglee’. The star, who has been training in martial arts for 30 years now, will put his well-acquired skills to the test when his character Raj takes on an international poacher's racket to save elephants.

 While we have seen the hunk flex his muscles in the pictures and clips from the sets featuring him doing the balancing act on glass bottles and much more, he proved that we’ve not seen it all. In a workout video, the actor gave fans a brief look at his rigorous training on an exercise bar. “I don't fear flying... What I do fear is not even making an attempt to fly! More videos coming soon... #kalaripayattu #yoga #calisthenics #backlever,” he said in the caption.
