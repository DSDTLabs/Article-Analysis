GURUGRAM: The Class VII student of a well-known  , who had posted an obscene message against his teacher and threatened to   her daughter on a social networking site last month, on Tuesday told child welfare committee (CWC) officials that his act was a result of his teacher’s cold behaviour towards him. 
 
 “We spoke to the boy on Tuesday and asked him why he had sent that message. He said he was angry the teacher hadn’t been replying to his ‘good morning’ wishes for 3-4 days.

 CWC officials said they will suggest counselling sessions for the boy. 
  
 Meanwhile, the school has come out with another statement, in which it claimed it has offered legal help to the teacher. 
  
 “While the incident took place outside campus and beyond school hours, the school was proactive in addressing the incident and conducted a thorough investigation with due diligence. Our investigation, conversations and discussions with students, faculty and parents brought to light facts which were shared with the concerned people, including government authorities during their visit,” the statement reads. 
  
 “The school has a zero-tolerance policy for such acts and took disciplinary action against the concerned student, which included suspension, and mandated counselling. The school offered the concerned faculty member a platform to facilitate her legal proceedings, but she decided not to proceed with the same and requested the school to keep the matter private,” the statement added. 
  
 However, sources told TOI the teacher and her daughter did not return to school till Wednesday, even as the school authorities have asked her to reconsider her resignation.
