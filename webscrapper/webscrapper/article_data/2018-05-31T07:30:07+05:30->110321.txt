BENGALURU: Citizens’ demand for   did not come up for discussion during the first   of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( ) even as rain lashed the city on Wednesday.

 
 Before the meeting began, hundreds of pourakarmikas staged a protest in front of the council building, demanding their wages pending for the past five months. They claimed they have not received a single rupee in their accounts since January while the revised wage of Rs 14,040 continues to be a distant dream.
 
 The issue of garbage collection took centre stage during the meet. Corporators from nearly all wards took BBMP health department officials to task for the lack of clarity regarding the number of pourakarmikas on rolls, efficiency of the biometric identification system and provision of uniforms, gloves, masks and other tools to the sanitation workers. According to the state government guidelines, 700:1 ratio of people to pourakarmikas is adequate.
 
 Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner (health and solid waste management), said while 15,000 pourakarmikas were being paid directly, there were around 4,000-5,000 whose status is yet to be identified. “There were a large number of bogus entries of people who have worked less than a year. Also, there are workers whose ESI/PF contribution records are yet to be verified to prove they have worked for over a year. Once we audit and cross-check the numbers, we will credit all salaries to genuine workers,” he said.
 
 Padmanabha Reddy, leader of opposition in the council, said Bengaluru is being affected due to strikes by pourakarmikas and garbage auto/truck drivers.
 
 Mayor R Sampath Raj said all decisions will be taken by keeping in mind the BBMP’s financial capability.
