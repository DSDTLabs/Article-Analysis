GUWAHATI: A young   inspector, Bhaskar Kalita, the Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Bordumsa police station in Tinsukia district of Assam, was killed in an encounter with ULFA (Independent) militants near the inter-state border with   late Friday night.

 
 Three militants are also suspected to have been killed in the encounter and an operation is on to search the bodies, police said.
 
 Kalita took nine bullets in his body before dying. He was leading a group of CRPF Cobra battalion in a raid in a house near Bordumsa after receiving information about the presence of ULFA(I) extremists there.
 
 Kalita’s death has now put Assam Police under scanner because the officer was wearing a bullet proof jacket and yet post mortem revealed that two of the nine bullets of Tavor X95 rifle he received on his body had passed through the bullet proof jacket. Kalita, who hails from Azara in   (rural) district leaves behind his parents, wife and two minor children.
 
 About two decades back Assam Police was rocked by scam in purchase of bullet proof vehicles for its personnel after the   pointed out that the vehicles were sub-standard.
 
 Director General of Police Kuladhar Saikia who visited Bordumsa where he paid the last respect to the slain officer on Saturday morning said that he would be enquiring into the bullet proof issue which has come to light.
 
 “We have lost a brave officer. The counter-insurgency operation will be intensified. We will examine the bullet proof jackets with our personnel,” Saikia said.
 
 Ulfa(I) leader  , who called from a undisclosed location, said that his organization does not consider Assam Police as its enemy.
