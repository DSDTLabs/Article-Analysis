Mumbai: In a big positive for an Indian pharmaceutical company,   has announced that the   (USFDA) will lift an import alert imposed on the   (Punjab) manufacturing facility. This will pave way for resumption of exports from the plant to the company’s biggest market — the US — after four years.

 Sun Pharma said on Tuesday that the USFDA had informed it about its plans to remove the Mohali plant from   ( ) status.This will clear the path for the company to export from the Mohali facility to the US market, subject to USFDA regulatory requirements, it said in a statement. The move would come as a boost since growth of Sun Pharma’s US business has been hit over the past year as five of its plants face supply restrictions due to regulatory issues. After the announcement, Sun Pharma’s scrip surged by nearly 4% to end at a three-month high of Rs 708 by close of Tuesday’s trade on the  . The Mohali facility was inherited by Sun Pharma as part of its acquisition of   in 2015. In 2013, the US drug regulator had taken action against the facility when it ordered it to be fully subject to Ranbaxy’s consent decree of permanent injunction, banning exports from the plant. 
 
 The Mohali plant clearance may not add to sales immediately, but it removes an overhang, according to analysts. Sun Pharma may now be able to shift production to Mohali from other plants such as Halol in western India, which face supply restrictions. Certain conditions of the consent decree will continue to be applicable to the Mohali facility, the company added. Sun Pharma, the world’s fifth-largest maker of  , reported its first fall in quarterly profits in a year last month as pricing issues and supply constraints impacted US sales.
