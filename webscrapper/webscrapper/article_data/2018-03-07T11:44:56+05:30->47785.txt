Privately-run senior citizens’ homes in the city have come under the scanner of the officials as none comply with norms laid down by the state government. None of the homes have registered with the district social welfare office.

 S  , 82, filed public interest litigation two years ago and ensured that the government passed orders for the privately-run old age homes. He said, “Once real estate players found that it is a lucrative market, they entered the field and made it into a profit making industry.   of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 and the   government 2009 rules under the same act were not adequate to control the private players. So, we filed a PIL and got the GO. It addresses government homes and individual players. But it has been 13 months and the GO has not been implemented. We have visited all offices,” he said.
 
 District social welfare officer   said, “There is a government order (Number 83) under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 that states that all old age homes should be registered with us. But none have registered. We have sent show cause notices and are taking steps,” she said. She said she had received complaints from at least four senior citizen homes in the city in the last two years
 
 Deputy director of social welfare department   said, “We have examined and issued detailed guidelines for running the senior citizens’ homes. We have instructed the district collector and social welfare officers to adhere to it. Minimum standards on how to maintain these homes have been laid out. There are some trouble making homes and promoters. We are inspecting them periodically and issuing orders based on the reports submitted by officials,” he said.
