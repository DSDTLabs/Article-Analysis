The   is locally known as a no nonsense, gutsy woman. “She was well-known in the   station area for being hard-working and friendly. She was ready to fight with anyone if the situation demanded it,“ said an elderly ragpicker woman at Vashi.

 Many told TOI she often comes once a week to Vashi station to meet up with friends.
 
 In January 2013, TOI had briefly met her at the ashram.Despite the trauma, multiple stab injuries and friend's murder, she smiled. She said cheerfully, “Ab sab theek hai (Everything is fine now).“
 
 A local crime branch official had recalled, “The survivor was bleeding profusely from her neck and other parts but she used all her inner strength to crawl out of the cavity under the flyover and alert passers-by and police.That is how we got to know about the rape and murder. She is certainly tough as nails and was determined to make the offenders pay for killing her friend.“
 
 Currently, most local ragpickers and hutment-dwellers near the station are aware about the death rap but they do not know if she also knows about it.
