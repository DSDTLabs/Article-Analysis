HYDERABAD:   was caught in a tangle between Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) despite cancellation of land allotment. Nothing moved despite Telangana government writing to ED, raising objections to attachment of land.

 According to TSIIC officials, InduTech Zone land allotment was cancelled as the company failed to develop tech zone. “We wrote to ED, stating land cannot be attached and TSIIC has right to resume the land as SEZ was not developed. We are waiting for an ED response,” said a TSIIC official.
  
  
 In November 2017, Indu-Tech Zone filed a petition in Hyderabad High Court against the Telangana government challenging cancellation of land allotment.
 
 Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation on September 24, 2015, cancelled the sale agreement-cumpower of attorney of 2006 and deed of sale of 2009 with respect to land measuring 150 acres in SyNo 99/1Mamidipally village, Saroornagar mandal, Ranga Reddy district.
 
 InduTech Zone filed a writ in High Court, stating that cancellation is arbitrary unjust and violates Article 300-A (right to property) of the Constitution. The case is still pending in court.
 
 Originally, then AP government allotted 250 acres to InduTech zone owned by Shyam Prasad Reddy at Mamidipally village in Ranga Reddy district to establish IT/ITES SEZ. In April 2007, after the Centre approved the SEZ, the promoter Shyam Prasad Reddy allegedly transferred around 100 acres to SPR properties owned by his family members.
 
 TSIIC officials and chief commissioner of land administration which visited Indu-Tech Zone in 2014 said only three buildings were constructed, but not the SEZ.
