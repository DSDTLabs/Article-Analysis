MUMBAI:   said they will honour the Bombay high court judgment, but claimed that the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA)’s format of filling details subtly aims to   and not just regulate it.

 The FRA uses software to decide the fee structure for colleges and courses based on their income and expenditure. The main objective is to ensure there is no profiteering and that colleges should have reasonable surplus.
 
 An official from one of the autonomous colleges that had moved court said they had hoped for a ruling in their favour. “While the UGC wants us to excel in education and give us freedom in several aspects, the state government’s policies are holding us back. If they want us to give 7th Pay Commission-prescribed salaries to teachers, make students industry-ready, focus on high-quality research, there should be some autonomy to decide the fees. All these need investments,” said the official. The institutes are undecided about an appeal.
 
 Another official pointed out that though the HC said the FRA will only regulate the fees and the colleges can fix their own fee structure, the process is not conducive to colleges. “The software is designed in such a manner that it almost looks like the authority wants to fix the fees. We will honour the HC order. But it is not possible to provide a 360 degree approach in education if autonomy is curbed,” said the official.
