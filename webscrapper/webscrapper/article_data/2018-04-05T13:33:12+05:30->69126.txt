KERI: Sighting the ruby-throated yellow   is a rare occurrence but in  , a forested village of   in the foothills of the Sahyadris, Goa’s state bird has found its new home. 

 Bird watchers make their way into the thick of the   Wildlife Sanctuary, braving the long distance to the remote village for just a glimpse of the now-elusive bird. People from other parts of India and foreigners are seen here more than local visitors.
 
 Nanora, nestled on the banks of the Mhadei, with a perennial flow in this upper stretch of the river attracts different species of birds throughout the year, said bird enthusiast  . “There is abundance of insects due to favourable conditions and Nanora is one of the best places in Goa to enjoy the beauty of the ruby-throated yellow bulbul,” he said.
 
 Also known as the flame-throated bulbul, the bird is black-capped with olive-green upper parts and yellow underneath. 
 
 Elsewhere in the evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, this bird is often found in small flocks, mostly in   thickets and bushes along rivers. It draws visitors with its sweet, hurried and rather high pitched tweet.
 
 Goa has caught on with bird watchers across the globe with more than 450 bird species reported and migratory birds flying in during the mild winter season.
