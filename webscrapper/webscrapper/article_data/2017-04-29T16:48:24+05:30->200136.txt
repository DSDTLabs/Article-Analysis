Acclaimed Peruvian photog rapher Mario Testino, whose `Towel Series' has featured Hollywood actresses like Penelope Cruz, Blake Lively, Kristen Stewart, Amanda Seyfried, fashion maven Anna Wintour, pop-stars Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, among others, has chosen   for his foray into  . The monochrome picture featuring the 33-year-old   in a, well, towel, recently found its place of pride as the second post Kat has put up on Instagram after her debut on the photo-sharing site, on Thursday. Speaking to Mirror, the celebrity photographer said, “I loved working with Katrina.

  
  
 This was my first shoot with a Bollywood star. "According to Mario, it was a picture of Brit supermodel Kate Moss posing in a white bathrobe, with her hair wrapped in a towel, on a film set, that sparked off the idea for the series. The on-going series has since been regarded as “liberating“ by its creator." "I think men and women feel a sense of freedom because there is no predominated manner in which a towel should be put on. You can wear it however you want," Mario contends, adding that he first met Kat at a party in Mumbai this January and the duo instantly hit it off.
 
 Shot over a day-long schedule at a suburban five-star, Mario says it was a treat to click Kat. “For the first time, I regretted the fact that series didn't allow much scope for movement; I would have loved to capture her amazing dancing skills. I wish to shoot a towel video with her soon.Spending time with Katrina was great and the pictures look fantastic,“ Mario signed off.
