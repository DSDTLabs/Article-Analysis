MUMBAI: The   will be built in   not by the Supreme Court’s order, but because of   Narendra Modi’s diktat,   said in an editorial on Thursday. Stating that the Uttar Pradesh assembly poll result is a popular verdict in favour of the Ram temple, Saamna urged SC to keep away from the issue.

 “Today, the entire country pays heed to what Modi says. The general atmosphere...is such that Muslims too would listen to PM’s advice on the matter. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath too had said there would be no communal flare-up in the state...Muslims should give up their obduracy and help build the Ram temple,” said the Sena mouthpiece. 
 
 The Sena, as NDA partner, has long been clamouring for building the Ram temple. Party chief Uddhav Thackeray has often slammed the BJP for going soft on the issue.
 
 Urging Muslims to give up their long-fought claim on the disputed site in Ayodhya, Saamna said, “The Babri mosque has been pulled down and there is a small Ram temple there...A new mosque could be constructed somewhere in Ayodhya.”
 
 Saamna riled the SC for urging the opposing parties to resolve the conflict through negotiations. “The SC was supposed to hand down its ruling...instead, the court advised the two parties to start talks in a bid to amicably settle the long-standing dispute...this is akin to court suggesting out-of-court settlement in family disputes or property issues.” tnn
