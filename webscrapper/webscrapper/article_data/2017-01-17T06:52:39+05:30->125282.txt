LUDHIANA:   led   (TMC) will contest on approximately 40 seats in Punjab elections. This was stated by party's newly appointed Punjab chief,   at a press conference held in Ludhiana on Monday. He also announced names of five candidates, namely ex congressman Jagdeep Singh Goldy Kamboj from Jalalabad, professor   from Budhlada, Hargopal Singh from Balachaur, Harbans Singh from Ludhiana South and Manjit Singh from Garhshankar.
Brar claimed that he is not contesting elections. He said he will campaign for the party's other candidates instead and ensure that all of them emerge victorious.
 
 Brar also said TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee will visit Punjab soon and during her two-day stay here, she will conduct six rallies of the party candidates. “Captain should contest only from one constituency and I think he will backtrack from fighting from Lambi at the last moment,“ he said attacking Punjab Congress chief.
