INDORE: The plan of   ( ) authorities to start reverse trial at the automated driving test track system was marred by technical issue.

 A day after authorities started conducting test on the U-shaped track, a technical glitch was developed and the system starting announcing applicant failed even when they drive in a right manner. “We had to stop the test on U-shaped track as there is technical issue with the automated system. We conducted test of at least five applicants on Tuesday and none of them could clear it,” said RTO MP  .
 
 This forced them to conduct a check if the applicants were really not able to drive on the track or it was the system’s failure.
 
 “We went through manual test of these applicants in which it was found that even though they drove the vehicle without touching the outlines, none of them was announced passed by the system,” said Singh.
 
 We have asked the agency engaged in maintenance and operations of automate driving track to solve this malfunction. “As of now we have stopped conducting the test on U-shaped track, and continuing with our previous arrangement,” he said.
 
 Officials said that this is expected to be solved within a day or two, and after which they will make it compulsory for applicants of four wheeler driving licences.
 
 This is not the first time when RTO officials have to postpone their plan of introducing reverse trial on the automated driving test track. RTO officials have been making efforts to introduce reverse trial on the automated driving test track. Earlier, they had announced to introduce it after  , but it was also delayed.
 
 RTO authorities had earlier stopped conducting the test on U-shaped track after they found that aspirants were facing difficultly in clearing the reverse direction test since the curve on U-shape track was very narrow.
