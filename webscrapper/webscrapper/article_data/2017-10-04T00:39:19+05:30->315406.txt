GURUGRAM:  ,   in Sector 50 where 2,500 residents live, is   for a week after its   was cut for  . 

 The RWA of the society has now approached the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) for relief, saying paying the bill is the job of the developer and residents should not be punished for it.
 
 Discom DHBVN cut the connections of Fresco and Escape, another society, in Sector 50 because of arrears of Rs 1.2 crore that have accumulated over two months. 
 
 In a letter to the HERC, the residents said they pay electricity charges to the builder in advance, but the builder did not make the payment to DHBVN. “Our power supply will be restored as soon as Unitech clears the dues. However, the discom has a responsibility to issue us the bill, not the developer, since the meter is in the name of the RWA. And in case of non-payment of the bills, they are supposed to give us two days’ notice before cutting the supply,” said Nilesh, a member of the RWA. The developer pays the power bills, as the maintenance of the society has not been handed over to the RWA yet.
 
 Power supply was disconnected on September 28. 
 
 The RWA said it is not a commercial connection but a residential connection, and residents have already paid the bill in advance. 
 
 “We understand that the developer has to clear unpaid bills. But the discom cannot settle their accounts at the cost of residents. We are spending lakhs in running the diesel generator sets, which is also adding to air pollution,” said Supriyo Dasgupta, another resident.
 
 He added that they want to ensure that matter is raised so that no other society has to face the same problem again.
 
 Unitech and DHBVN representatives did not comment on the matter.
