AHMEDABAD: Parents of class 1 students at   have sought refund from the school authorities as the school is yet to receive approval for its affiliation with   (CBSE). The proposal was put forth on Friday in a meeting held between school trustees and parents. The school authorities announced to hike the fees to Rs 52,000 with effect from next academic year.

  “Since there has been no approval from CBSE regarding the affiliation, the school authorities can’t increase the fees. We’ve already paid the fees and therefore, it would be best if we get the refund until there is no word regarding the affiliation,” said a parent. 
 
 In fact, the school had given a written assurance to the district education office stating it would not hike fees. Confirming this, DPEO   said, “Last week, the school had given us a written assurance that it wouldn’t hike fees.”
 
 Muktak Kapadia, trustee of HB Kapadia School said, “We will hold another meeting with the parents on February 27. We are hopeful we will get permission for affiliation from the board.”
