LUDHIANA: Confused over the dates of property tax  , tax-payers are still demanding 10% rebate on the tax amount, whereas actually there is 10% penalty. It is due to this confusion that the   could generate only Rs 20.41 lakh from   returns. Only 652 people filed their property tax returns in all four zones. This is lower than last Saturday when MC had generated Rs 34 lakh from property tax returns. MC offices are kept open on Saturdays for collection of property tax, water, and sewerage dues.

 On Saturday, officials received Rs 20.41 lakh from property tax returns, and from water supply and sewerage dues, they generated Rs 12 lakh. Officials were expecting at least Rs 1 crore collection from both taxes on Saturday, as people are left with only a few days to the end of the financial year. As per officials, more than one lakh people are yet to file their tax returns.
 
 Regarding the poor response, officials claimed that people usually come when there are only one or two days left for the close of the financial year. Moreover, people had developed some confusion regarding the property tax waiver scheme, which was announced by the   department in October last year. MC superintendent   said people were demanding 10% rebate on total tax, while there was no option of rebate now. Rather, at this moment, there is 10% penalty on the amount until April 15, and after that the penalty would be doubled. 
 
 WHATâ€™S WAIVER SCHEME?
 
 Property tax waiver was announced in October 2017, and from 16 October 2017 to 15 January 2018, the department issued 10% rebate on the tax amount, and there was no penalty and interest. From January 16 to April 15, there is 10% penalty, but interest is still not being charged. After this, the penalty amount would increase to 20%. This scheme was launched to give a chance to tax-payers to clear their outstanding tax amount not only for this financial year, but also for previous years since 2013.
