MUMBAI: Kaali-peeli taxi   have opposed the Central government move asking cabbies to compulsorily fit   by April 1. Union leaders on Wednesday demanded that GPS be installed at ‘government cost’ to ensure safety of women in Mumbai.

 The ministry of road transport and highways on Wednesday tweeted that from April 1, passenger transport vehicles, including taxis and buses, are to be mandatorily equipped with GPS devices.
 
 A L Quadros of Mumbai Taximen’s union said, “The government should sponsor the installation of GPS devices in Kaali-peelis and Cool Cabs in Mumbai, or there can be mobile apps which can enable tracking of rides. It will not be possible for drivers to spend extra money on these gadgets.” He said the government should sanction special funds for this purpose similar to the Nirbhaya fund. State governments already have special funds to instal GPS and CCTV cameras in buses.
 
 Reacting to the government directive on penalty for those installing crash guards/bull bars on vehicles, Quadros said: “Nearly 5,000   have the safety (crash) guards and it will be impractical to remove them. These taxis are secured by the crash guards as it protects the driver, passengers and also the vehicle during a mishap.”
 
 The union has threatened to protest if the directive is not rolled back. “We will not pay any fine as these crash guards were installed after our drivers had to dispose of Premier Padmini taxis in 2008, when the maximum age limit was fixed,” he said. Nearly 12,000 drivers had then replaced the Padmini taxis with the affordable Maruti Omni vans. 
 
 “If there is a mishap between two vehicles, there could be serious injuries or fatalities due to the crash guard,” an RTO official stated, adding hefty fines may be imposed on vehicles found illegally installed with these guards.
