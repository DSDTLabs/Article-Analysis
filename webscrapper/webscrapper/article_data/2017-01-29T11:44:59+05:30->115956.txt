 who's last   outing was 'Banjo' opposite Riteish Deshmukh is spending her days taking exotic vacays to the most amazing holiday destinations across the globe. She has been spending the last few days in   and the leggy lass has been posting some rather interesting pictures from her beach holiday. The svelte actress seems to be having the time of her life basking in the sun. 

 
  
 In a recent selfie, the actress can be seen wearing over-sized sun glasses, with her earphones plugged in. Perfect way to enjoy the beach, isn't it? She captioned the picture, 'Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without" -Confucius Throwback to good times in Belize #music #vacation.
 
  
  
 Nargis, who debuted opposite   in  's 'Rockstar', is often admired for her wit and carefree attitude. And she exudes the same attitude in her pictures as well. So who else is green with envy looking at this picture?
