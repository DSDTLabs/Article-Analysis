 Additional solicitor general A N S Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that around 20 states and UTs had so far set up state level advisory body but only three had held two or more meetings.

The municipal bodies collect 43 million tonnes every year, out of which 11.9 million tonnes are treated and 31 million is dumped in landfill sites.
