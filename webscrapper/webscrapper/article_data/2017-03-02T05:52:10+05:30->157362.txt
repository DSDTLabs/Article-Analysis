Navi Mumbai: City commuters will now be able to locate   buses on their cellphones. 

 The   ( ) has been designed to allow commuters get real-time status of services and even provide live feedback. 
 
  “This is probably the first city bus service that will have a mobile application with features providing real-time bus info, facility to set reminders for arrivals, ticket booking, smart card recharge and online pass approval system,” said civic chief Tukaram Mundhe. 
 
 The idea is to switch from being supply-driven to being demand-driven, Mundhe said.
 
 The app has been incorporated into NMMC’s e-connect application and has information about all 58 routes of the transport body. The system will reportedly apply to 400 buses and work is on for the remaining 45 buses. One can also send text or WhatsApp messages to share the status of a service via the application. 
 
 “This system could also be a tool for investigation, as it could provide precise timing information, bus number and even the name of the driver and conductor,” Mundhe added.
