CHENNAI: A week after the state government made registration of   online, problems in clearances continued, with many saying they had to visit the sub-registrar offices concerned several times to sort out problems.

 Revenue department officials maintain that the number of online registrations has exceeded the daily average, but applicants say the process is anything but user-friendly. “The move is futuristic, but, it is facing critical teething problems. Registrations that can be completed manually in three hours are taking three days,” said  , a   resident who visited a sub-registrar office to register a trust deed.
 
 A visit to a couple of offices in the city found people waiting for long hours for the draft documents to be cleared online without which the process is not complete. A builder who preferred anonymity said he had problems visiting registrar’s offices on multiple occasions. “The aim is to eliminate the physical presence of buyer/seller during the process. But, we are being asked to visit sub-registrar’s offices,” he said.
 
 Since February 12, when the registration department portal was upgraded with STAR 2.0 (Simplified and  ) service, a target was fixed for all 575 sub-registrar offices in the state based on the average number of registrations received between April 1, 2017 and January 31, 2018, said inspector general of registrations J   in a circular.
 
 If the number of online registrations is lesser than the target, it reflects on the delay at the sub-registrar’s office concerned, the circular said. “It is warned that action will be initiated against such officials under the   civil services (discipline and appeal) rules.” When contacted, Kumaragurubaran said more than 8,000 documents were registered on Wednesday across the state, way over the daily average. “We will provide training for Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India members to resolve issues faced by builders during  ,” he added.
