Surat:  , the Surat Diamond Association (SDA) has organized a seminar in the presence of industry leaders on September 25. 

 In the last one-and-a-half-month, the industry has witnessed defaults to the tune of over Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai and Surat. Many traders dealing in the rough and polished diamonds have lost money.
 
 Industry sources said the business environment in the diamond industry has been distorted due to the series of defaults. Recently, a diamond broker was beaten up by some anti-social elements in Mahidhapura market after he was unable to recover the Rs 16 lakh payment from the diamond buyer. 
 
 The brokers and traders are the important link in the diamond industry. Post-GST, the business environment in the industry has transformed. The business will be accounted for and that the fly-by-night operators will move out of the industry. 
 
 SDA president Babu Gujarati said, “The seminar is important for the traders and brokers. In present situation, there is an urgent need to discontinue the credit system in the industry. Most of the defaults in the recent past have taken place due to the credit system policy.”
