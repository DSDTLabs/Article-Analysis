PUNE: This year, controlling street crimes, like chain snatching,   is the top priority for the police.

 “Though we have succeeded in controlling street crimes, chain snatching incidents are still happening,” said police commissioner Rashmi   on Thursday. “We will review our action plan and act accordingly,” she added.
 
 There has been an increase in vehicle thefts too, Shukla said, adding that the rise in the number of such cases, especially in areas like Pimpri Chinchwad, Hadapsar, Mundhwa and Kondhwa, was a cause for worry. “We have formed an anti-vehicle theft unit to detect cases of vehicles theft,” she said, adding, “We have also identified vulnerable spots and have started keeping a watch on theses spots.”
 
 The city police have also decided to improve their response time to crimes against women in the backdrop of the molestation incident in Bengaluru on January 1. The police also plan to intensify patrolling on the streets and create awareness among women.
 
 The police commissioner also expressed her desire to reduce pendency of cases and applications at the commissionerate.
 
 Prompted by a call from Prime Minister   to have at least two smart police stations at the commissionerate, the city police plan to convert all 39 police stations under the commissionerate into smart police stations this year.
 
 The forthcoming municipal elections are also one of the biggest challenges facing the city police this year, Shukla said, adding that the entire police force was geared towards ensuring a free and fair election.
