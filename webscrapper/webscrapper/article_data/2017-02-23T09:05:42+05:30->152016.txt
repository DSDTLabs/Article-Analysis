Today marks the release of Kichcha Sudeep’s  , which is Sandalwood’s biggest release ever, hitting over 400 screens. “We began this film with positivity and expectations, but it has grown beyond what I could ever imagine,” says director Krishna. He says that his second film, Hebbuli, was inspired by a thought that occured in his mind nearly three years ago. 

 “This is a commercial film, but beneath the surface of it, a purpose and a social concern is addressed. I do not want to reveal it, instead I want people to debate it,” says Krishna. The filmmaker compares this frenzy to that surrounding  . “One fan has booked 800 tickets for a show and is having a special screening. These gestures are very heartening,” signs off Krishna.
