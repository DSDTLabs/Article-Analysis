MUMBAI: The Sharad Pawarled NCP on Wednesday knocked the doors of  , justice (retired) M L  , to seek a probe against controversial tourism minister Jaikumar   for alleged irregularities in land deals in   and Nandurbar.

 A delegation led by NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik and NCP’s women wing head   submitted a memorandum against Rawal. “We have submitted documents to establish Rawal’s dubious role in land deals in Dhule and Nandurbar districts. Pending inquiry, chief minister   must sack him,” Malik said.
 
 NCP stepped up its offensive against Rawal following the recent suicide of 84-year-old farmer Dharma Patil over inadequate compensation for his land, which had been acquired for a solar power project.
 
 Patil’s contention was that while he was paid Rs 10 lakh, his neighbours were paid between Rs 1 crore and Rs 2 crore.
 
 Malik has demanded a highlevel probe into Rawal’s land dealings in the thermal power project in Vikharan village, Bahyane small irrigation project in Nandurbar and Wadi Shewadi irrigation project in Dhule. “We requested justice Tahiliani to get information about land transactions involving him and his family for last 20 years and compensation received," Malik said.
 
 Trashing the charges, Rawal said, “There is no substance in the allegations. I have already filed a criminal defamation complaint against Malik."
