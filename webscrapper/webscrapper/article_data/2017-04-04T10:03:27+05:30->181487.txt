JAIPUR: The   (PWD) will bring a   allowing existing and proposed sections of state highways passing through   to become   if a by-pass connects to it. The move will make such stretches of highways passing through urban or rural areas immune to the recent SC ruling banning alcohol within distances of 500 meters and 220 metres.

 Through the order the government intends making the process of de-notification of state highways a one-time exercise. Under this all roads passing through limits of city, towns, tehsils and panchayats will get de-notified, relinquishing the status of state highways if it is connected through a by-pass.
 
 “We are working on the lines of central government where they have made similar provisions for national highways. Instead of de-notifying each road, old portion of state highways by default will become part of local bodies once the highway is aligned through a by-pass,” said Shiv Lahari Sharma, chief engineer, PWD.
 
 “There cannot be two state highways with same number passing through same area. So once by-pass is constructed, the old section passing through populated areas will automatically come under the local body and loose its highway status” added Sharma.
 
 The notification though will become a shield for liquor shops as they will not require winding up their shops, permit rooms and bars as per the Apex court order. As per the orders there is a ban on liquor vends within 500 metres of national and state highways from April 1. However, this ban is not applicable on other roads.
 
 The department, however, refuted claims that the decision is to benefit liquor vends. Officials claim that it is a continuous process which will be carried out even in future. “Our mandate is to construct and maintain roads. It has nothing to do SC ruling on liquor shops. Notification will be issued by the end of this month” said Sharma.
