JAIPUR:   have made   to keep the animals cool in the scorching heat in   and   (NBP).

 Other than placing coolers and changing the diet,   has put up thatched sheds and installed water sprinklers in cages. The oldest inmate of Jaipur zoo, the African baboon spent the whole day before the cooler.
 
 The ducting system in NBP is providing relief to lions, tigers, bears and panthers. Authorities give animals baths in the morning and evening to keep their body temperature under control. Similarly, the diet of inmates has been changed to include more liquid and reduced the quantity of meat for carnivores.
 
 “We are giving them water laced with glucose to protect their body from dehydration. A complete summer protocol is being followed to ensure that they don’t suffer from heat stroke and to maintain their behavioural pattern,” said Dr Arving Mathur, senior veterinarian, Jaipur zoo.
 
 The number of visitors has dwindled due to heat at both the places. It fell drastically at Nahargarh due to its distance from the city. During the day, the caged animals don’t engage in any activity and remain at one place. “They become lethargic due to heat and become inactive,” said Mathur. The NBP has trees around enclosures to provide green cover.
 
 Cleanliness is also high on the agenda of authorities. They have been keeping the enclosures clean to prevent diseases. Animals are also being monitored to check for change in behavioural patterns.
 
 Zubaida Khan, a visitor, said that animals were spending time before coolers but wanted more to help them beat the heat. “The authorities should place water sprinklers in all cages to lower temperature. It’s a challenging task as every animal has a different level of tolerance for heat,” said Khan.
