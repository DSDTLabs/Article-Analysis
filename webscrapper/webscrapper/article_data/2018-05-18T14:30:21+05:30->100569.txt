COIMBATORE: At a time when there has been an increase in percentage of medical emergencies due to poisoning, the state government has decided to establish a poison treatment centre at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) at the earliest.

 Poisoning, including reptile bites and consuming pesticides, is considered as one of the major reasons for increase in mortality rate after trauma, cardiac arrest and stroke, according to sources in CMCH. About five persons seeking medical emergencies due to poisoning are admitted in the hospital every day.
 
 A poison treatment centre will established at five medical college and hospitals in Coimbatore, Madurai, Thanjavur, Vellore and Tiruvannamalai, said a source from the health department.
 
 A sum of Rs 245 lakh has been estimated to establish a centre with facilities like ventilators, haemodialysis machine, temporary pace makers, multi-para monitors, antidote bank and a basic toxicology lab.
 
 “The ward would have at least 20 beds,” the source said.
 
 “The centre is already established at the   (MMC) six months back. We would speed up the establishment work across the state after studying the success rate at the centre,” said Edwin Joe, Director of   (DME). The death rate due to poisoning has come down by 40%, as per the centre’s report.
 
 We are planning to conduct a review process shortly, he said. Preliminary works at the Madurai medical college and hospital was almost done and it would be opened within a month.
 
 “We have directed the rest of the hospitals to identify area to establish the centre within three weeks,” he said adding that they would commence the work at the earliest.
 
 Apart from consuming poisons, the number of patients treated for snake bites is high in the district. Over 900 patients were treated in 2017 for snake bites. Of them, 600 were men. Wasp sting, bee sting and injuries due to human-animal conflicts were minimal in the district.
