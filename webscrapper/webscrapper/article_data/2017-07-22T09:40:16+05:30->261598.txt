HYDERABAD: Flooded with complaints of potholed and waterlogged roads during the latest deluge, the   ( ) may have given its engineers a 10-day deadline to carry out the tall task of restoring roads running into nearly 300 km in five zones and the 2,100 potholes adorning them, but experts feel that instead of taking up hasty patchwork, the civic body should think about long-term road planning to resolve the issue.

 A survey conducted by citybased   (SIEST) last year had revealed that though the average lifespan of a road should be at least 15 years, roads in Hyderabad do not last more than three months because of poor quality and bad planning.
 
 According to P Surya Pra kash, founder, Smart Infrastructural Engineering Services Trust, the basic problem plaguing the city's roads is that GHMC engineers fail to follow proper design and planning norms during road building and restoration.
 
 “If you ask for a proper design they will not have one as they are not following any plan.Unless GHMC thinks of a longterm solution, roads will continue to get damaged every year,“ he said.
 
 Agreeing, Anant Maringanti from   said: “This is the case every year, the monsoon comes and the roads get damaged.“
 
 But despite SIEST submit ting its survey report to the GHMC commissioner and chief engineer in January this year, specifying in detail the measures required to improve the quality of roads, replete with the cost calculations, the civic body does not seem to have learnt any lessons.
 
 “The state allocates around `200 crore to `500 crore for repairing roads every year. Instead we gave an estimate of `7000 crore along with remedies on laying quality roads that will last 15-20 years, but they have not heeded our suggestions. If this continues, roads will only last between December to May before going back to their potholed ways,“ Surya   added.
 
 “Engineers just cover the potholes with tar on top as they are in a hurry to finish work.They need a better road re-laying plan,“ said an activist, also blaming the city's poor drainage system for water logged roads even after a light shower.
