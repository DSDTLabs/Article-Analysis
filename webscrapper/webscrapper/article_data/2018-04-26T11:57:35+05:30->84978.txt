GUWAHATI:   woed   members to head the   in   even as the move has angered saffron party's central leaders and its ally   (MNF) ahead of assembly polls later this year. 

 The election to the 20-member council was held on Friday and result for 19 seats were declared on Tuesday. MNF won eight, Congress won six and BJP won five seats, while the result of one seat is not declared yet after high court order following a petition filed by the MNF candidate. 
 
 After Congress on Wednesday brought BJP members to its side to form the legislature party, BJP and MNF leaders opposed the move. MNF is one of the constituents in the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance ----- an umbrella body of anti-Congress regional parties of Northeast. 
 
 While MNF leaders asserted BJP-MNF coalition will head the council, saffron party leaders from Delhi and Guwahati reached state capital Aizawl on Thursday to sort out things. 
 
 "This cannot happen because BJP and MNF are together in principle. MNF has emerged as the single largest party, and we will form the coalition with BJP in the council, " a BJP leader said. 
 
 Mizoram is the last remaining Congress-ruled out of seven states in Northeast. BJP which heads the governments in Tripura, Assam, Manipur and   and part of coalition governments in Nagaland and Meghalaya, do want to leave out its members easily to be part of the Congress-led coalition in the council in Mizoram. 
 
 BJP is closely working with MNF eyeing the assembly polls in Mizoram to wrest the state out of Congress. 
 
 "We are confident MNF-BJP coalition will head the council, " the leader added.
