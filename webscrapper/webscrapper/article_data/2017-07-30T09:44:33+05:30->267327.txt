PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Even as members of the municipal council may nudge the Lonavla police to ease restrictions on tourists through the monsoon months, the hill town saw fewer tourists on Saturday as compared with other weekends since June. 

 Surekha Jadhav, president of the Lonavla Municipal Council has been advocating that the police refrain from imposing restrictions on tourists’ entry into the town as it affects the local economy. On the other hand, the police clarified that safety of life is more important.
 
 Speaking with TOI, Jadhav said, “The town’economy is dependent on tourists, who come here mainly in the two to three monsoon months. If the police impose restrictions on their entry, tourists will get frightened and will prefer to stay away. This directly affects the income of local businesses. So I have requested the police not to impose restrictions on tourist entry.”
 
 According to inspector   of Lonavla city police the number of tourist at the hill station was much less as against earlier weekends. 
 
 Jadhav explained, “There was lesser rainfall until this afternoon so the number of tourists in Lonavla was also quite thin. Traffic movement in the town and on roads leading to various tourist points was quite smooth. We did not have to put restrictions on tourist entry on the steps of   dam either.”
 
 Azhar Contractor, president of the Lonavla Khandala Hotels Association, made a more plausible observation about the reduced flow of tourists, “This was the fifth Saturday of the month and it would’ve been a working day for many people. Moreover, the month of Shravan has also begun.”
 
 Contractor added, “This weekend, the flow of tourists to Lonavla town has been 20 to 30 per cent lower than in previous weekends. As a result, hotel occupancy has also reduced.”
