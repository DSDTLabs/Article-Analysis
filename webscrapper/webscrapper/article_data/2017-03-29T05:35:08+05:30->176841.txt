 M K Adling, assistant inspector of the Wakad police station, told TOI the 40-year-old woman was alone at her house on Monday afternoon. “Around 3.30pm, the suspect tried to gain entry into her house by telling her he was a salesman and wanted to show her some products. The woman let him in,” Adling said.
 
 The suspect asked for a glass of water, said Adling.
 
 When the woman went into the kitchen, Kamble followed her. He suddenly drew a sharp knife and started threatening her. “He demanded money and the panicked woman showed him where she had kept cash. The suspect found Rs300 and left the house with it,” Adling said.
 
 As soon as Kamble headed out, the woman raised an alarm. “The alerted neighbours chased after the man and nabbed him. He was later handed over to the police,” Adling said.
 
 During interrogation, Kamble revealed it was his first robbery attempt. “Kamble is jobless and indebted. To earn easy money for repaying his loan, he chose to rob people,” Adling said.
 
 Kamble also confessed he was aware that the woman was alone at her residence in the afternoon. “Our probe is on,” Adling said.
