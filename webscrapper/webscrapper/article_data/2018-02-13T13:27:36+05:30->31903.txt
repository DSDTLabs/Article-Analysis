The foundation’s managing trustee, Priyanshi Patel, said that they chose to work with women prisoners as part of their Right to Cleanliness programme, which they began last year.
 
 “Many things are manufactured inside prisons, but there is no work for women prisoners. Production of sanitary napkins could be work in which these women could be engaged in. We will train the prisoners for this and production will start by March 1. The cost of setting up the unit will be about Rs 4 lakh,” Patel said.
