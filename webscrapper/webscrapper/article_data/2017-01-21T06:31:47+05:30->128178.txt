JAIPUR: Gulzar is a poet who has always engaged with the times, fully aware of the  .

 His latest collection, the bilingual ‘Suspected Poems’, translated into English by former diplomat and politician  , is a series of little vignettes that serves as a powerful narrative of our troubled period.
 
 At the   on Friday, Varma said Gulzar’s earlier collections were simply called ‘Selected Poems’ and ‘Neglected Poems’.
 
 But, this time, Gulzar explained that his translator was constantly imputing hidden meanings to his lines. So it occurred to him that the best title would be ‘Suspected Poems’.
 
 These ‘hidden meanings’ turned out to be a veiled commentary, more powerful than much of the political discourse witnessed at JLF on Friday.
 
 A startling five-line poem about a young man with a tattoo of a nilgai on his shoulder shows the ever present fear of communal clashes. The youth’s choice of the animal is not a whim, but rather the hope that he may be spared if he’s caught in communal violence!
 
 Another short poem about an ant, which is moving up and down the sharp edge of a knife that had sliced through a mausambi, reveals the precarious and powerless condition of the Dalit man watching it.
 
 Yet another poem is about a man at a passport office. Asked for a birthmark for identification, the Sardarji pauses, peels off his shirt and reveals a burn mark from the 1984 riots. “This won't go,” he says.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Gulzar was effusive in his praise for the translator, also the force behind the book. “Gulzar would have one or two of these little poems scattered around, published in little pieces, and I urged him to bring them together in a book,” Varma said.
 
 Acknowledging his translator’s work, Gulzar said, “It was reading the poems in English that made me think they were quite good. I do take a swipe at politicians, but it is not an attack. The poems bark, they do not bite.”
