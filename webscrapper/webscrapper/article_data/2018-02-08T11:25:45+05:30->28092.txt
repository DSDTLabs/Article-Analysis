PATNA: Fourteen-year-old Class IX student  , who was kidnapped at gunpoint for Rs 1.5 crore ransom and rescued by the Patna police within 12 hours, failed to sleep the whole night after returning home on Tuesday.

 Zeyad said his father   was anxiously waiting for him outside the house at Bhikhachak in Gardanibagh, where he was held captive, along with a police force. “I returned home around midnight and embraced by mother and two sisters. However, I failed to sleep the whole night. Each and every moment of my captivity and subsequent release kept haunting me,” he said.
 
 Zeyad, a football lover and student of   in Danapur, was kidnapped from   around 7.15am when he was on way to catch his school bus. 
 
 “Only one of the kidnappers used to enter the room in the house where I was kept. I saw him in new dress with his face covered every time he entered the room. He even tried to change his voice to avoid being identified. The kidnappers made a Rs 1.5 crore ransom call to my father and threatened to kill me if the amount was not paid within two days. After they came to know that the matter has been reported to police, the kidnappers told me that my father has taken a wrong step which may even cost my life,”   said.
 
 “When I heard a female voice in the house, it gave me a ray of hope. I raised an alarm, but she could not hear my shouts,” Zeyad said, adding two policemen entered the room around evening and unchained him.
 
 The boy said he would resume school in a couple of days.
