MUMBAI: After seeking a compliance report from the CEO of the   in the matter of implementing the Lodha Panel reforms, the   (COA) filed its first status report in the Supreme Court on Saturday.

 This comes just two days before the Supreme Court is set to hear BCCI interim secretary  's plea, seeking clarity on the role of the COA, which, in a petition (filed by Choudhary), is "passing directions which give an impression that they are to administer the BCCI."
 
 The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the plea after Choudhary submitted his plea last week.
 
 The timing of COA submitting its status report in the Supreme Court assumes importance especially in the backdrop of the fact that the administrators are looking to highlight the Jharkhand-based office-bearer's wisdom in questioning the COA after submitting a 'conditional' undertaking to implement the Lodha Panel reforms.
 
 Acting on the CEO's compliance report, submitted on February 10, the COA has once again submitted all timelines for implementation of reforms, supplied by the   secretary Gopal Sankaranarayanan; minutes of the September 30, 2016 Special General Meeting (SGM); and a copy of the affidavit filed in November 2016 by former BCCI secretary  .
 
 The status report highlights the fact that the reforms are "yet to be implemented" by majority state associations.
