The Minneapolis' US Bank Stadium will be hosting the much-awaited New England Patriots vs Philadelphia Eagles   game on Sunday, February 4, 2018. 

 The $1.1 billion US Bank Stadium was completed last year by the Dallas-based architecture firm HKS. The HKS also designed AT&T Stadium near Dallas and Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
 
 This state-of-the-art venue has drawn its inspiration from the sharp, jagged shapes of ice that is formed in the nearby Mississippi River each winter.
 
 A fixed-roof stadium, the US Bank Stadium is built on the former site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and is the home of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). 
 
 The stadium's roof is made up of 60 per cent Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a fluorine-based clear plastic, and is the largest in North America, spanning 240,000 square feet. The five giant glass doors at the stadium’s west entrance are 75 to 95 feet tall.
 
 The seating capacity of the US Bank Stadium is 66,665 for most of the events which is slightly more than the Metrodome. The stadium can be expanded to 73,000 for events such as - soccer matches, concerts,   and other special events. 
 
 The upcoming events at US Bank Stadium include - ESPN X Games on July 19–22, 2018, the 2019 NCAA Final Four, and the 2020 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.
