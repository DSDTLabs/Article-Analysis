The five year term of ZP had ended in February 2017 and polls were slated to be held along with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). However, due to a case in   of  , the state election commission (SEC) did not hold the polls.

 A day after the date for other elections was announced, the HC dismissed the petition against Nagpur ZP elections. Recently, SEC announced the dates for elections for six municipal corporations including Chandrapur. The polls would be held on April 19. It was expected that polls for Nagpur ZP would also be held on the same day. However, SEC strangely did not include Nagpur ZP in its poll programme.
 
 Extension to the ZP means that all the office-bearers including the president will continue to hold their posts until the new body takes charge after elections.
