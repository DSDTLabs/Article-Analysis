After ‘Jaanwar’ and ‘Andaaz’, filmmaker Suneel Darshan’s ‘Ek Rishtaa – The Bond Of Love’ will premiere on television tonight. Suneel reminisces, “The film has been a nostalgic journey. It’s symbolic of my experiences. It’s about the interactions I’ve had with people, close and distant, people I’ve trusted and learnt to distrust, people I’ve banked on and been left disillusioned by and people who unexpectedly stood by me.” 

  Suneel was delighted when   agreed to play the family patriarch with   cast as his son. This was the first time they teamed up for a film. The drama also featured Raakhee,   and Juhi Chawla in pivotal roles. The 2001-family entertainer had music composed by Nadeem-Shravan and was counted among those films that did well at the box office that year. 
 
  Watch the World Television Premiere of ‘Ek Rishtaa – The Bond of Love’, tonight 9 PM only on Zee Cinema.
