LUDHIANA: The residents of 53 villages that were supposed to be included in the city limits did not give positive response to the   when they visited these areas while making public aware of the step.

 From Tuesday onwards, the civic officials had started making announcements in the villages stating that the said areas could be part of the   as city limits were being extended up to 1 km. The villagers were told that in case they had any issues in this regard then they could register their objections with the department by April 25.
 
 However, the move may take time and is likely to could be extended after MC elections due in June. 
 
 Civic officials on Tuesday covered villages, including Dhandran, Manakwal, Bulara, Mehmoodpura, Gillan, Rania, Jaspal Bangar, Fatehpur, Pratap Singh Wala, Chooharpur, Jassian, Lalton Kalan, Daad, Jhande, Tharikey, Ayali Kalan and Phoolanwal. The rest will be covered on Wednesday.
 
 However, the officials claim that they are making people aware of the move because in case city limits gets extended it should have the will of people residing in these villages. But the villagers say that they do not want to come under MC limits as they would be asked to pay taxes and panchayat system will also come to end and they will not get grants. 
 
 The officials have asked the villagers to submit their objections with the MC by April 25 and final decision would be taken up after a public hearing. 
 
 Senior town planner   said it was a lengthy procedure to extend city limits because first they would note down objections and then public hearing would take place. "On the basis of the public hearing, the committee concerned will take a decision and it will be sent to the government for final notification," she added. 
 
 Notably, the MC officials had asked for the objections earlier as well, but due to assembly elections they did not receive much response from the public.
