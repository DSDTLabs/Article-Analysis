COIMBATORE: The one-man commission, which is in the city to conduct the final phase of inquiry into violence during 2017 pro-jallikattu protests, has said it would take at least a year to submit the final report.

 The commission headed by retired Madras high court judge S Rajeswaran was to question police officials, including deputy commissioner of police S Lakshmi, who were on duty during the protests.
 
 “The commission is visiting the city for the fifth time. I had inquired about 50 people and in this phase 13 people were asked to appear before the commission,” said Rajeswaren, while speaking to reporters on Wednesday.
 
 “The commission has started inquiring police officials in Madurai and Chennai too. These inquires would take six to seven months to complete. The final report would be submitted in about a year,” he added.
 
 He said has received mixed response from the public, till date. “The commission has summoned 689 people so far. It is not summoning again those who failed to appear before it, unless the commission considers it is important to record their point of view,” he said. 
 
 All those people who wanted to appear before the commission after missing their scheduled time, would have to approach the commission through their lawyer, he added.
 
 The state government asked the commission to probe into the circumstances leading to violence during the pro-jallikattu stir at the Marina beach in Chennai and other places in the state.
