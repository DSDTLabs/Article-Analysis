PIMRI CHINCHWAD: The   has said its members will press the   (NOTA) button on the   during the forthcoming Pimpri Chinchwad civic polls in February where candidates may contest in seats reserved for OBC by claiming that they belong to kunbi caste. 

 In the past, at least three corporators were disqualified when they provided false information that they belong to the OBC category. 
 
 There are 35 seats reserved for candidates belonging to the OBC category of the 128 seats. The population of OBCs is expected to be around five lakh considering that the total population of the city is around 20 lakh.
 
 Pratap Gujar, president of the samiti, said casting NOTA votes will be a form of boycott. “The OBC communities received 27% reservation in local self-government bodies due to Mandal Commission in 1992. Candidates belonging to castes in the OBC category were elected in large numbers in various local self-government bodies during the 1997 elections. Later, women were granted 33% reservation in 2002, due to which candidates belonging to open category obtained OBC certificates. The number of genuine OBC category candidates getting elected from seats meant for them is declining since then,” adding, “We have sent letters to all political parties appealing to them not to nominate them for reserved seats to persons who have obtained the OBC certificate by submitting false information.”
