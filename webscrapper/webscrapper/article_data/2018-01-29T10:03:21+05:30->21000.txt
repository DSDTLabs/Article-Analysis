THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Questioning the authenticity of the clearance certificate from Dubai Police produced by   (son of CPM state secretary  ) to prove his innocence in the alleged cheating case against him,   state president Kummanam   said that the case was still shrouded in mystery.

 In a   post on Sunday, the BJP leader said the police clearance certificate secured by Binoy and his own statement agreeing to his involvement in a previous cheque case were in total contradiction. "The clearance certificate, which Binoy produced, has only complicated the whole affair. As per the complaint from Jaas Tourism company owner, published by media, Binoy owes Rs 13 crore to his company. The question now is whether he has repaid the amount," Rajasekharan said.
 
 The BJP state president also challenged Balakrishnan to take legal action against media and the businessman, the complainant in the case, 'if the case was a fabricated one'. "The CPM leadership has not yet denied receipt of such a complaint, while party PB member S   has said that party doesn't believe either Binoy's or the Dubai-based businessman's versions. The situation calls for an explanation from the CPM state secretary," he said.
 
 He also said that people had every right to know about the nature of Binoy's business abroad, as he was the son of the secretary of the party ruling the state. "Balakrishnan should also reveal the sources of capital for the big business his son is doing in Dubai," he demanded.
