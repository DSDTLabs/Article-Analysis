ALWAR: A video clip of   cabinet minister  , the   candidate for the Alwar   bypoll, purportedly asking Hindus to vote for BJP and Muslims for   has gone viral on social media.

 The remarks are seen as an attempt to polarise the upcoming bypoll.
 
 In the video, the minister is purportedly heard narrating how during his election campaign Muslims in Mewat had told him they would vote for him because of his development work, but not for the BJP as it was a party of Hindus.
 
 
 
 “So, if you are a Hindu, vote for me, and if you are a Muslim, vote for the Congress,” Yadav is heard summing up his election speech at Dugheda village in Alwar district.
 
 In another video clip, the minister and his supporters are heard exhorting people to come with as many vehicles as possible on nomination filing day and that Yadav would foot the bill for all those vehicles.
 
 Yadav, however, denied the allegations and said the video clips were a Congress conspiracy. Yadav said Congressmen were distorting his videos. “Earlier, when I said that our Prime minister   is the ‘best PM’, Congress people distorted it and claimed that I was saying Modi was the ‘bhrasht (corrupt) PM’,” Yadav said.
 
 The labour and employment minister said Congress was playing dirty politics because it was worried by the reception being accorded to him in Mewat region.
 
 The Congress, on the other hand, filed a complaint with the district returning officer alleging that the BJP candidate was seeking votes in the name of religion and caste. Congress handed over a copy of the video clips to the returning officer.
