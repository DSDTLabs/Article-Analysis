MUMBAI: The city has become India’s most expensive to board a flight from. Unlike the country’s other cities, there are hardly any flights out of Mumbai on which last-minute fares aren’t high. If you live in Bengaluru, Rs 2,500 will buy you a one-way air ticket to Goa this weekend. If you’re in Delhi, you could fly to Kolkata for Rs 4,000 or Dehradun for Rs 5,000 on a non-stop flight.

 
 
  
 
 In Chennai, you will get the best international deals as Rs 10,000 would put you on a flight to Singapore, while Rs 15,000 will buy you a ticket to Dubai. If Chennai’s residents believe that the fares are high, they can take solace in that the cheapest fare from Mumbai to Dubai is Rs 20,000, while to Singapore is Rs 30,000.
 
 For those in Hyderabad, Rs 3,000 would buy an air ticket to Goa. Flyers from Mumbai too can fly to Goa for Rs 3,000 this weekend, but it would be on a flight that lands at 2am on Sunday. For landing in Goa in a better hour, the cheapest ticket is Rs 6,500. Fares to other destinations from Mumbai are higher. If you want to join your friend in Delhi for a Dehradun trip, you pay Rs 13,000. For Port Blair, the price is Rs 13,500 on a flight that halts in Kolkata (Delhi-Port Blair is Rs 9,400 on a non-stop flight).
 
 Return tickets from most top tourist destinations are high, across the board. Like is the case with onward journeys, the return flights to Mumbai are priced higher. The cheapest tickets on flights out of Mumbai invariably would be on red-eye flights that depart close to midnight and land at the destination in the early hours. “Fares on flights that depart during the day would typically cost 15-20% more on most routes. The situation will keep getting worse till the time Mumbai gets a second airport,”’ said a top official from a low-cost carrier.
