SHIMLA: Taking cognizance of the burning of medical waste generated by medical colleges-   and Hospital, Shimla, and Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College and Hospital, Tanda, in  , the Himachal Pradesh high court has sought reply from the state government through an affidavit on the issue within two weeks.

 It was also brought to the notice of the high court that due to the burning of waste in the open, rivers were getting polluted at eight places. Taking suo motu notice, a division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Ajay Mohan Goel sought reply from the government in this regard. The high court came to know that medical waste generated by Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital was being burnt in open at a garbage plant at Bharyal, resulting in environment pollution. Despite Supreme Court directions, solid waste processing plants have not been set up in the state.
 
 Himachal Pradesh has 61 urban local bodies, including cantonment boards, and only 10 of them have either installed or is constructing waste processing or disposal facility. The remaining urban local bodies dispose of the waste at designated sites. Even the urban local bodies having waste disposal or processing facility too are not functioning properly. In the state around 300-350 metric tonnes of waste is generated daily while there is no exact record of how much is biodegradable, recyclable or inert.
 
 Urban local bodies of Rohru, Rampur, Paonta, Parwanoo, Bilaspur, Manali, Kullu and Chamba are disposing of solid waste along the river side, caring little for the environment.
