MUMBAI:   principal U M Maske has urged chief minister Devendra   to stall construction of the   III as it was damaging the college building. In the letter, he said drilling was endangering the lives of over 5,000 students and staff.

 He said fresh cracks had developed in a basement pillar. “For the last few days, Mumbai   Rail Corp Ltd (MMRCL) has been using a new machine which is causing high-frequency vibrations throughout the building. The noise makes it difficult for students to hear professors,” he said. “Further, work which involves high-power underground boring machines could severely   the building,” he wrote. He said he had urged the CM as his pleas to MMRCL and   had gone unheeded. The building houses the commerce and law colleges.
 
 Structural engineer Jamshed Sukhadwalla said a pre-construction building condition survey should have been done by a third party. “The survey by the contractor’s sub-contractor is not healthy. The survey report does not give details of the basement and its structural conditions,” said Sukhadwalla. Basement columns have bulged and buckled and it clearly indicated excessive load on them, he added.
 
 An MMRCL official said contractors had not skipped any structure in the building during the survey. “In Siddharth College’s case, there has been a problem of misinformation. We understand our responsibilities and we will take care of all damages, and necessary remedial measures too. We will look into the fresh complaint by the principal,” said the official.
