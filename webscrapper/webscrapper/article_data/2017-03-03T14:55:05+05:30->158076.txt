PANAJI: Former PWD minister and MGP’s chief ministerial candidate Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’   on Thursday came out in support of the decision of the Union ministry of road transport and highways grant in-principle approval for upgrading 229km of major district roads (MDRs) and state highways (SHs) in Goa to national highways (NHs), saying it was a very good decision.

 Speaking to TOI, Dhavalikar said that that it will benefit the state as the state government does not have funds to improve the roads in the state.
 
 When asked about the thousands of people who will lose their homes, and the religious structures and commercial establishments that would have to be demolished to make way for the new national highways, Dhavalikar said, “We can rehabilitate those who lose their houses. We can provide plots and construct houses for them whose houses will be demolished in road widening. Those houses will last for around 100 years.”
 
 He also said that when the union government has given in-principal approval for upgradation of state highways to national highways, it means that the proposal must have gone from the state. “Though, I don’t remember exactly, if we had sent the proposal for the upgradation,” he added. He added that last time the state government had paid Rs 12,000 per square meter for the houses, which had to be demolished for the widening of the Panaji-Ponda national highway.
 
 Reacting to chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar’s statement that the state government might consider denotifying NHs to save liquor shops following the Supreme Court’s order, Dhavalikar said that it would be a wrong decision and this will stop about Rs 300 crore funds to the state. “We are getting Rs 60 crore per year under central road funds, which we use for maintenance of state roads. In five years, it adds up to Rs 300 crore. With that Rs 300 crore we can rehabilitate liquor shops beyond 500 meters from state and national highways.”
