CHANDIGARH: Five persons, including two women and two cops, had a narrow escape when a police control room (PCR) van collied with an SUV at the roundabout between sectors 3 and 4 on Saturday. In the accident, both the vehicles got damaged.

  Singh, a resident of Sector 11, Panchkula, who driving the SUV, said he was going to MLA hostel in Sector 3 from Sector 11. His sister and mother were also with him. As he reached the roundabout between sectors 3 and 4, a PCR van hit his car from behind, Udit said. The impact of the collision was such that the SUV overturned three times on road, claimed Udit, who is a BA 3rd year student.
 
 Although all the three occupants of the SUV escaped unhurt, the accident halted the traffic at the roundabout for almost half-an-hour. Two constables in the PCR van also escaped without injuries. However, both the SUV and the PCR van were damaged. The passersby informed police about the accident and a recovery van reached to remove the damaged vehicles from the spot. After the accident, both the parties indulged into a heated conversation with each other. Poonam Dilawari, SHO of Sector 3 police station, reached the spot and pacified them.
 
 PCR van driver   denied the allegation given by Udit Singh and said it was the SUV which was being driven at a high speed.
 
 However, no FIR has been registered till the time of filing the report. Sector 3 police said the matter is being investigated and an FIR will be registered against the erring driver only after a thorough probe.
