GHAZIABAD: An FIR has been registered against a builder,  , for allegedly delaying   of flats to buyers. The FIR followed a directive from a   court on March 23. 

 As many as 11 buyers of KDPMGI Gharaunda, a residential project of   with 330 units in Raj Nagar Extension, have alleged that the flats had been delayed for over four years. They claimed most of the buyers had already paid 95-98% of the amount to the builder. On Sunday, the police recorded the statements of six of the 11 complainants.
 
 The FIR has been registered at   police station against the group’s directors, Manoj Kumar Goyal and Kavita Rani Goyal, besides one Ashish Goyal under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.
 
 Dushyant Kumar Tyagi, one of the homebuyers and a complainant, said: “The project was launched in 2011 and the developers had agreed to hand over the flats from March 2014. But even after four years, the project is far from complete. Several meetings were held with the group, but no positive outcome came out of them. Every time, they gave us a new deadline but never fulfilled their promise.”
 
 KDP director Manoj Kumar Goyal refuted the allegations. “We will give the possession of flats this month itself. We have already issued the offer of possession to homebuyers. Those who are making payments are being given the flats. The map of the project has also been approved by the   and power connection will be given in 15 days. We will also get the completion certificate soon,” he said.
 
 Goyal has also moved court against the buyers, accusing them of misrepresenting facts. The case will come up for hearing on April 5, he added.
