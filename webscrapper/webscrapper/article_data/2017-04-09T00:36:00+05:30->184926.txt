Jaipur: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has appealed to Muslim families to grant property rights to their daughters as per Quranic instructions. The appeal was made during the first day of 5th annual meet of women’s wing of AIMPLB held here on Saturday. The board members, while addressing 150 Muslim leaders, said that Quran gives 1/4th property rights to daughters.

 Dr Asma Zohra, president of AIMPLB women’s wing said, “Islam is the only religion on the face of earth which talks about the inheritance of property for  . This is the biggest example of gender neutrality, if implemented properly it can change the fate of women.” The board members said that this Quranic jurisprudence should be made part of the Indian Law for achieving gender equality and gender justice.
 
 Elaborating on the new model nikahnama, Yasmin Farooqui, member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board says that the most disliked thing by Allah is divorce. “The model nikahnama introduced in Rajasthan discourages talaq to the core. It guides married couples to lead a harmonious life and in case of any dispute, attempt should be made to resolve it amicably,” said Farooqui.
 
 The wing will approach religious clerics against the complete ban on dowry. “Imams in mosques will be asked to spread the message that dowry should be banned and those who insist should face social boycott,” said Farooqui.
 
 The inaugural day of the two-day workshop saw sessions on—Marriage and Divorce in Islam, Rights of women in Quran and Constitution and Role of All India Muslim Personal Law Board. A special session of AIMPLB members with the intelligentsia women—doctors, lawyers, social activists, academicians, theologists and students will be held on Sunday.
