GANDHINAGAR: A   headed by   has proposed a series of changes in   that industry and the   had been demanding for a long time. 

 These include giving permission to hold land even if an industry has not built any unit on it within the stipulated time of three to 10 years. The committee has also proposed a change in the premium rate imposed by the government if a unit is not commissioned on land acquired for industrial purpose. However, some officials in the state government say that if rules governing the use of land acquired for setting up industries are drastically changed, land banks will be created which will lead to artificial increase in rates.
 
  
  A senior officer aware of the proposals said:“The high-power committee of the state government formed to ease the problems related to land, faced by the industry, has recommended a series of amendments. The government is considering bills to effect the changes proposed by the committee.” 
 
 The officer said that many industries are facing genuine problems due to complex regulations. “But there are chances of misuse of these relaxations as there are groups who have amassed disputed land and want to create land banks for future gain,” he said. “So, the proposals, instead of serving the government’s purpose of promoting genuine investors, will promote dead investment in land by a few and escalate prices,.”
