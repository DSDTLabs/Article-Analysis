MUMBAI: This year too, students appearing for the JEE (Advanced) scheduled on May 21 will have to follow   and ensure they do not carry any of the prohibited items. 

 In 2016, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) which conduct the exam introduced the dress code and released a list of prohibited items in the exam centres Like  .
 
 One of the instructions issued on the admit cards available to students from May 10 read, “It is advisable not to wear charms,  , items containing metals such as ring, bracelet, earrings, nose pin, chain /necklace, pendants, badge, brooch, hair pin, hair band, clothes with full sleeves or big buttons. It is advisable to wear open footwear like chappals and sandals.”
 
 Parents claimed the IITs had toned down their instructions. “For this year’s exam, the IITs have used the word ‘advisable’ as opposed to 2016 when it said ‘do not’. So it seems like they have toned down the prohibition but now the interpretation will be left to the centre,” said a parent.
 
 Earlier this year, a teacher from the city, had written to the IITs asking them to issue clear instructions to all exam centres that removal of kada (bracelet) from non-turbaned Sikhs and removal of any other religious articles from turbaned Sikhs is strictly prohibited.
 
 Over 1.74 lakh students from across the country will appear for the exam on Sunday.
