Mangaluru: St Joseph Engineering College (SJEC) has been recognized as the virtual labs nodal centre by participating institute  , Surathkal. 

 The virtual labs is a project initiated by the ministry of human resource development, government of India, under the national mission on education through information and communication technology.
