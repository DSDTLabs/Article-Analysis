GAYA: Residents of   are ruing over   in   for the past few months. Altogether there are 174 ATMs in Gaya district.

 District magistrate Abhishek Singh said the administration is concerned only with the maintenance of the currency chest with different banks. “Feeding the ATMs with cash is the responsibility of the lead bank manager,” Singh added. An employee of   (PNB) RP Poddar who claimed to be the lead bank manager of Gaya district said there is acute shortage of Rs 2000 and Rs 500 denomination notes.
 
 Lead bank manager is an officer of scale III or above rank appointed by the bank, which has the highest number of branches in the district.
 
 “Most of the ATMs are being fed with denomination of Rs 100 and the cash tray gets empty very soon. Though, generally Rs 25 lakh can be put in one machine at a time, Rs 100 cassette cannot hold more than Rs 5 lakh. The machines have not been calibrated to hold Rs 200 notes as of now,” Poddar said.
 
 He added, “The banks are not getting enough cash, more so, Rs 2000 notes. As against a demand of Rs 50 crore in Gaya, hardly Rs 5 crore is being supplied by the RBI.” Sources said cash shortage is adversely affecting business activities. “Most of the medium and small businessmen do cash business. Issues of link failure and periodical snags make cashless transactions too difficult,”   president Kaushalendra Pratap.
 
 Another problem being faced by Gaya businessmen is the excessive accumulation of coins. “Post demonetisation, Rs 10, 5, 2 and 1 coins have flooded the market and there are few takers for coins,” said the business body chief.
 
 He added, “Banks too do not accept more than Rs 1000 in currency and that too very reluctantly. If businessman refuse currency, officials crack the whip,” complained the Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce chief here on Friday.
