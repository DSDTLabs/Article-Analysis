There are many scientific topics that are not included in school curriculum. Students can broaden their knowledge if they learn different topics, said Vishal Chaudhary, education officer of physics at   on Monday. He was speaking during a creative science workshop organized by the centre at its headquarters at  . 

 The six-day workshop for students of Std VI to XI includes different topics like rocketry, robotics, aero modelling, astronomy and physics. The second batch of the workshop would began on May 15, said N Ramdas Iyer, project coordinator at the centre.
 
 He further added, “We believe in facilitating learning rather than teaching. It makes children think and that is how they start learning. We want to encourage children to imagine and provide them with a framework for the same. Such workshops strikes the right chords in the heart of children,” Iyer said.
 
 Children learnt about vacuum through practical demonstrations like boiling water and inflating balloons in the absence of air pressure. 
 
 Abhimanyu Bhelave, another education officer, taught laws of physics that govern aeroplanes. “Kids will make six different gliders, including a paper and a polystyrene glider, which will perform limited aerial manoeuvres,” he said. 
 
 Education officer of astronomy   said, “We will teach children to identify constellations and direction using simple devices like sundials, telescope and a sun ball projector. We will also teach them how to make these devices.”
 
 The registration fee for the six-day workshop is Rs750. It include kits and equipment required for practical demonstrations. 
 
 Thirty students participated in the first batch of the workshop. Paarth Tiwaskar, a student, said that sun dial would help him survive in case he gets stranded alone at an unknown place. 
 
 Another student   said, “I am looking forward to inculcate a habit of scientific thinking.”
