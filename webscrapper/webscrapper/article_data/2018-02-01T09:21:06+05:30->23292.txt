MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday impleaded director of town and country planning and secretary of housing and urban development to lay proper road from   to Surveyor colony also known as 120ft road. It also sought appearance of the Madurai corporation commissioner on Friday to know the position of the corporation.

 The division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and R   heard a contempt plea filed by M Sundararaj from   in Madurai.
 
 When it came up for hearing, the petitioner counsel M   told the court that the 120 ft Maattuthaavani and Surveyor colony road has been in the worst condition. When the petitioner filed a case last year before the court to carry out repair works, the corporation told the court that the work had been sanctioned and works will begin in near future. The court, in turn, directed the corporation to carry out patch works and remove debris from the road to ensure a free flow of vehicle movements. But the corporation disobeyed the court order, by which the corporation committed contempt of court so that corporation commissioner needed to be punished.
 
 The corporation’s counsel R   told the court that the 120ft road comes under the government’s scheme road project. As per it, the government should acquire adequate land and handover the same to the corporation. However, the scheme has not come into effect fully. Besides, the road that covers 1.25 km requires a huge fund, which the corporation could not afford due to insufficient funds.
 
 Following it, the court impleaded the director of town and country planning and secretary of housing and urban development to the case and directed the corporation commissioner to appear before it on Friday.
