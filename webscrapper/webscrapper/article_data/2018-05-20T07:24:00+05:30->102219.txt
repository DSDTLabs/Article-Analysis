GURUGRAM: Over a dozen   of   86 protested against   at Sector 31 on Saturday for a delay of nearly seven months in giving them possession of flats. The buyers alleged that according to the agreement, nearly 750 people were supposed to get their flats by September-October 2017. 

 They told TOI   announced the project in 2010 and started bookings shortly. “They pre-launched bookings without a licence for the group housing society,” said  , one of the homebuyers. “Ansal had taken nearly 95% of all payments when we forced it to sign a buyers’ agreement in 2012 and it finally got the licence.”
 
 Some of the residents recently filed an   query on the project with the department of town and country planning (DTCP) and claimed to have uncovered “shocking details”. “The licence that Ansal presented to   was under the name of a third party called Resolve Estate Private Limited. We have found out that DTCP issued a showcause notice to Resolve on 28 August, 2015, asking how Resolve could give licence issued to it to Ansal,” said Alok Singh, another homebuyer. “Morever, the licence expired on May 28, 2015, and Resolve has not asked for its renewal.”
 
 Nayak said that they have asked Ansal to return their money. “Ansal is saying it has no money. When we asked how soon we would get the flats, we were told it would take another year.”
 
 Ansal officials rejected the allegations, saying it would take 6-9 months to hand over the flats to the homebuyers. Officials claimed that Resolve was the land partner of Ansal and they have done nothing illegal.
