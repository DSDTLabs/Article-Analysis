BHUBANESWAR/NEW DELHI: A programme for inaugurating highway projects in Angul in Odisha turned into a fiasco on Friday after journalists alleged that media kits distributed to them had a 500-rupee currency note in each of them as “bribe“.   ( ) has ordered an inquiry saying strict action will be taken against those found guilty.

 Three Union ministers -  , Dharmendra Pradhan and   - and Odisha minister Nrusingha Charan Sahoo were present at the public event at Angul.
 
 Mediapersons staged a protest, waving the currency notes which they found in the kits, following which highways minister Gadkari skipped the scheduled interaction with them.
 
 Project director (NHAI), Bhubaneswar, Vinay Bansal, said he is not aware as to who did the mischief. BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said political rivals could be behind the “cheap act to defame BJP“, an allegation dismissed by Odisha minister and BJD vice-president Surya Narayan Patro. “There should be an inquiry to find out who tried to bribe the media. They have alleged that it's an act of NHAI.“
