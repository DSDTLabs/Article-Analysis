RAJKOT:   of   have launched a   in   to demand immediate release of   procured at   (MSP).

 The farmers are also demanding purchase of groundnut from those farmers who have already been issued the token and are in the waiting list. Health of one farmer Kanu Ambalia deteriorated and he was taken to the hospital.
 
 Farmers claim that government owes nearly 2,000 groundnut growers in the district nearly Rs 2 crore, which has not been paid for the last four months. They sold groundnut at MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg, but the payment has not been deposited in their accounts. There are nearly 1,800 farmers who received the message on their mobile to sell the groundnut at certain procurement centres and were issued tokens. However, their stock has not been procured till date.
 
 Government suspended procurement on January 19 after several complaints of malpractice. At that time, the stock of 904 farmers was lying in Bhatiya town packed in bags, while that of 204 farmers was lying at Lalpur centre in Jamnagar district. However, these centres are not registering them online for procurement.
 
 The farmer are also demanding crop insurance for cotton, which has not been declared yet, besides removing the irregularities in land measurement. 
 
 President of Khedut Hit Rakshak Samiti Pala Ambalia said, “We are on a hunger strike for all these demands. Besides groundnut procurement, the land measurement is done in a way which creates friction between farmers. Devbhoomi Dwarka was chosen for pilot project and that’s why highest irregularity in land measurement has been reported here.”
