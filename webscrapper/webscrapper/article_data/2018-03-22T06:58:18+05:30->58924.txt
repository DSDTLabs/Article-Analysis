AHMEDABAD :   has already consumed 68% of its groundwater; and there are no signs that consumption will slow down. Currently, Gujarat figures among the states that are the worst offenders in exploiting aquifers for domestic, irrigation, and industrial use. 

 The data was placed in the Lok Sabha on March 15 by Union minister of state for water resources Arjun Ram Meghwal. The data was provided by the Central   Board (CGWB). The report states that if all 30 states were to be assessed, it would emerge that 62% of groundwater has been exhausted. 
 
 States such as Punjab, Rajasthan, and Haryana are at a stage at which they can no longer extract groundwater — with their consumption going up to 149%, 140%, and 135%. These states can’t replenish their groundwater sources either. “It is because of groundwater levels in South Gujarat and parts of Central Gujarat that Gujarat seems to have presented 68% utilisation. In North Gujarat most wells stand over exploited,” says a senior official of the  . 
 
 In a single year, Gujarat uses almost 19.79 billion cubic metre (bcm) of water, of which 12.3bcm is used for irrigation, while 1.14bcm is used for domestic and industrial purposes. At this rate of consumption, CGWB says that Gujarat will be left with just 6.77bcm to meet future irrigation needs. Gujarat’s situation is not much different from that of Rajasthan, which has already used 140% of its groundwater and still maintains a consumption of 13.79bcm.
