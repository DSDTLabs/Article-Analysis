Tirupur: Members of trade bodies in the city petitioned the police on Wednesday to remove restriction on movement of heavy vehicles during peak hours — 8am to 11am and 4pm and 8pm. However, the police department said allowing of the heavy vehicles would result in more traffic congestion and accidents.

 “The goods from knitwear cluster should be transported to different units as a part of the manufacturing processes. The garment factories are located inside the city while the processing units like dyeing are on outskirts,” said S Nagarajan, president of Dyers Association of Tirupur, one of nine trade bodies that gave the petition.
 
 “Being exporting units, many companies have to make deliveries on schedule to retain foreign buyers. The problem is that units do not have cushion period to stretch the production, and any delay will affect the production planning and control,” said general secretary of Tirupur exporters’ association TR Vijayakumar. 
 
 “If the police allow the vehicles with load carrying capacity of up to six tonnes, it will help the industry. Such relaxation was in place, informally, about three years ago,” Nagarajan added.
 
 A higher police official told TOI that, “The banning of movement of medium and heavy vehicles during peak hours is followed across the country. The restriction was made considering different people would have needs. Moreover, it would not be possible to segregate the vehicles which belonged to the knitwear cluster and others.”
