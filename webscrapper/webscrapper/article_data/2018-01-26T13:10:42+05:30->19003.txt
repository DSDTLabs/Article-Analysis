LUCKNOW: Residents of 19 major localities of   will now have to approach   for mutation. LDA has issued an order announcing that it has stopped entertaining mutation requests of properties which are freehold and have been transferred to LMC. It has issued a list of 19 such  .

 LMC will handle mutation requests of all freehold properties of these colonies, while LDA will only be responsible for properties which are on lease or if the owner has passed away before the registration of property.
 
 
 The major colonies include many khands of Gomtinagar, Shardanagar Yojna, Kanpur Road Yojna, Sitapur Road Yojna, Jankipuram, Balaganj Complex, among others.
 
 Mutation is done in two cases, when the owner dies and the property is inherited or when the property is sold. In both cases, the name of the owner is changed. This is mostly done by LMC, but LDA had been getting these requests.
 
 LDA vice chairman   has set a week’s deadline to settle all the mutation cases piled up with LDA.
 
 “Only properties which need to publish a notice in print media for a period of 30 days will be disposed of after a month,” he said.
