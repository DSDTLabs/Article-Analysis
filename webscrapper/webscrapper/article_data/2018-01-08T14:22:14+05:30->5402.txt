AHMEDABAD: On Sunday,   were sucked into a  . For hours, visitors to the Flower Show and the   on the riverfront were caught in a snarled,   That clearly demonstrated the fact that the Ahmedabad traffic police, entrusted with the task of mitigating traffic jams, was acting as a catalyst to intensify them. Traffic lights, had they been allowed to operate, could have done a better job!

 Thousands who drove to the west bank road of the Sabarmati Riverfront were stuck in jams. The traffic then spilled onto the Ashram Road and connecting peripheral roads. A number of GSRTC buses were stuck on the stretch between Geeta Mandir and Paldi. The traffic woes only eased in the night.
 
 Majid Shaikh, a resident of Paldi, said that he had to wait for nearly 40 minutes on the Sabarmati Riverfront to get to the closest exit. “It is great that events such as the Flower Show and the Kite Festival are organized, but time and again roads are flooded with vehicles. I was with my family and regretted venturing out,” he said.
  
  
 The traffic also rattled those going to the VS Hospital. “My friend was admitted to the hospital after an accident and we had started off near the Deaf-Mute School on the Ashram Road,” said Abhishek Chauhan, a resident of Usmanpura. “To cross the stretch of about 1.5km, it took me over an hour. I could not even go to any peripheral road. I also saw two ambulances stuck near the hospital though commuters tried to give way.”
 
 Neerja Gotru, JCP (traffic), told TOI that the jams are expected to continue for the next few days. “Congestion was caused by events on the Sabarmati Riverfront,” she said. 
 
 “Traffic police personnel have been deployed on the roads to clear as much traffic as possible. Keeping in mind the days to come, more personnel will be deployed,” she said.
