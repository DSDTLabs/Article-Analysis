AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court denied bail to a juvenile accused and ordered to have him kept at an observation home, in connection with the murder of an 11-year-old boy,  , in the   area. 

 The sessions court rejected the bail application filed by the juvenile accused's father and upheld the detention order passed last month by the Juvenile Justice Board.
 
 Three persons, including two juveniles, were arrested for the abduction and murder of the 11-year-old. The court refused to allow the accused to live under his guardians' care on the grounds that the 17-year old boy has a criminal mindset and is in contact with offenders. If he is released on bail, he may come into contact with criminals and he may indulge in criminal activity again.
 
 The public prosecutor,  , submitted that the murder committed by the juvenile accused was gruesome. He placed examination reports by a psychiatrist and a general surgeon, opining that the boy thinks like an adult and is capable of committing an offence.
 
 The juvenile accused's father requested the court to grant his son bail so he could pursue his studies. The court said he could continue his studies at the remand home as well.
