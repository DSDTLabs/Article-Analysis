It’s not everyday that you get to meet the up and coming photographers of the city, and learn from them. It’s an even special experience, when you are a class VIII student, with a lot of creative passion and no means to express them. So, for a group of 30 kids from the   village, all belonging to lower income families, the recently-held   meet was one-of-a-kind. 

 Organised by two Mumbai groups of photography enthusiasts, this meet was one of the many community building exercise that Instagram encourages as part of the WorldWide Insta Meets. Said Meghna Girohtra, who came up with the idea, “The goal was to spend some time with these kids, who are immensely talented. Today, photography is a field that has become very gadget-oriented. We wanted to give these kids an idea of how, even with the simplest of tools, they can channel their creativity.” The group walked from   face, through the Worli village, to the  , where they watched the sunset and tried capturing the bright hues in their cameras.  , who runs photography workshops for kids, said, “I think we made their day. 
 
 They were exhilarated at the end. You see, these kids, they don’t really have much privacy, to express their thoughts and emotions, which they got to do with this walk. They explored, took photos and learnt so much. Most of them have very basic cameras, that are second hand giveaways. So, they were really fascinated by the fancy DSLRs of the other community members.”
