BHOPAL: Indo Tibetan Border Police ( ) has turned down the request of the   department to provide one of its companies to guard the Bhopal Central Jail. The department had made the plea in the aftermath of the jailbreak by alleged SIMI activists in October last year.

 Now, the state jail department is eyeing Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to provide one of its companies to guard the Bhopal Central Jail. Eight SIMI members had escaped from Bhopal central jail after murdering a jail guard and tying another on October 31 last year. All eight of them were later gunned down later in a police encounter on city outskirts. The incident prompted the state government to go for a reality check of security of jails.
 
 Security audit of all the 11 central jails of the state had been conducted and several recommendations were made. The jail department is also preparing a high-level security group from among its own staffers, some of them are being sent for National Security Guard (NSG) training. A proposal was also sent to ITBP for deploying a company for the security of the Bhopal Central Jail. As per the plan, the jail officials want to ensure that the outer security of the central jail is taken care of by the central security forces.
 
 “Not a single company of ITBP is deployed in the state as of now. Making all the arrangements for one company in the state does not seem feasible and so our request has been turned down. We have been asked to explore options among central forces whose companies are already deployed in the state like CISF and Central Reserve Police Force ( ),” additional director general (prisons) GR Meena told TOI. “As several other CISF companies are already deployed in the state capital. We are writing to the CISF for providing us a company to guard the Bhopal Central Jail. With this we intend to ensure that the central forces guard the outer circle of the jail while internal security will be taken care of by us,” said Meena.
