CHENNAI:   general secretary VK Sasikala’s nephew and party deputy general secretary TTV   will contest in the April 12 R K Nagar   in Chennai.

 The reconstituted parliamentary board of the party, which met at its headquarters here on Wednesday, unanimously decided to field Dinakaran in the RK Nagar which fell vacant following the demise of former chief minister J  .
 
 "I am proud to contest in the bypoll as the AIADMK candidate to continue the welfare measures initiated by Amma. It is my foremost responsibility for the next four years," Dinakaran said. 
 
 Dinakaran said he would win the bypoll with a margin of 50,000 votes with the support of the cadre and the public. 
 
 On the prospects of winning the constituency in the backdrop of a split in the AIADMK, Dinakaran said the party saw only DMK as its rival and not any individuals – former chief minister O Pannerselvam and Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa Jayakumar.
 
 Dinakaran ruled out becoming the chief minister after winning the bypoll. "It's a firm no. Edappadi K Palaniswami is our chief minister. Due to certain actions of the then chief minister O Panneerselvam, there was a demand to keep the party and government in one hand." There was a clamour in the party, with the functionaries and elected representatives demanding   to take over the mantle of the government along with party post, he said.
 
 The former MP said he would request Vaiko's MDMK, Vijayakanth's DMDK, the Congress and the BJP to support the AIADMK in the bypoll.
