Krishnagiri: A 38-year-old man was arrested for murdering his wife and daughter in Anchetty near Denkanikottai here on Wednesday. 

 According to police, S Seshadri, 38, a tempo van driver, is an alcoholic and he attempted to rape his 15-year-old daughter S Sakunthala, a Class X student on Tuesday. 
 
 Hearing her cry, her mother Kumutha, 34, a cook under noon-meal scheme in a government school, rushed to her help. 
 
  Kumutha found Seshadri attempting to rape Sakunthala in an inebriated condition, the Denkanikottai police said.
 
 When Kumutha tried to intervene and rescue her daughter, Seshadri took a wet-grinder stone and hit them with it. The duo, who received severe head injuries, died on the spot.
 
 When the neighbours came to know about the incident, they alerted the Denkanikottai police. Seshadri, however, managed to flee from the spot before the police reached there. 
 
 The police sent the bodies to Denkanikottai government hospital for postmortem. 
 
 Meanwhile, the police registered a case and started a search for Seshadri. They managed to nab him on Wednesday morning. He confessed his crime and based on his statement, he was arrested and produced before the Judicial Magistrate of Hosur sub-court. The court remanded him in judicial custody. Later, Seshadri was lodged in the Salem Central Prison.
