HYDERABAD: Lashing out at the   (UoH) in a strongly-worded letter, the SC/ST Teachers' Forum of the university claimed that authorities were extraordinarily harsh, unrelenting and insensitive towards  , a grieving mother, who lost her son Rohith in January last year.

 “Out of empathy and respect for her, a few faculty members offered security personnel that they would escort her to the Velivada (Dalit ghetto), but T V Rao, the chief security officer, responded that, 'the students will create disturbance, if allowed'. The faculty members then requested the students not to accompany Radhika, promising that they themselves would escort her and the students can form a human chain on either side of the road, a sort of guard of honour,“ the letter read. However that did not happen.
 
 “The university officials told us that she did not accept the offer of the security official, which is completely false. She was not allowed inside the UoH campus and was asked to leave,“ said  , a member of the forum.
