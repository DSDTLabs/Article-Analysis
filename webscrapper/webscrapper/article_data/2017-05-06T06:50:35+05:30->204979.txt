INDORE: Audhyogik   ( ) plans to develop infrastructure at industrial belts set up on the outskirts of the city to attract investments from new industries in the region.

 Existing industrial clusters far away from the city failed to attract investments due to the lack of proper infrastructure, resulting in almost negligible bookings of plots.
 
 According to the initial plan, the   department will develop the existing industrial belt at   in   district. AKVN is also coming up with new industrial belts near Indore eyeing some large scale industries.
 
 Kumar Purushottam, managing director (MD), AKVN said, “We have realised that industries are refraining from setting up facilities at places far away from the main city due to lack of roads and connectivity via airways. Keeping this in mind we now provide door step infrastructure at industrial belts.”
 
 The industry department has received encouraging enquiries from industries to set up facilities but most of them want to enter the developed zone due to proper infrastructure and facilities.
 
 The state government has allocated Rs 450 crore to the industry department for the fiscal 2017-2018 to develop roads, industrial parks, ecosystems, etc. in the region.
 
 In   2016-2017, a record 92 companies have proposed an investment of Rs 3,400 crore for the coming year in parts of Indore region. Of the total proposed investment, 23 are large scale companies and 69 are micro, small and medium enterprises.
