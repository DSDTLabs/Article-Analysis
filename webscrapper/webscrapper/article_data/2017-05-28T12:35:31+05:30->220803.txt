COIMBATORE: The onset of   is months away, but city hospitals have already started to report cases of  . The virus usually spreads during the monsoon season when mosquitoes breed in waterlogged areas. The change in trend has doctors worrying, but they said the virulence of the virus is low.

 At least five patients have been serologically tested positive for dengue at the   and Hospital (CMCH) where another 35 patients have been admitted with fever. Two days ago, a girl had died in a suspected case of dengue.
 
 “In the initial blood tests, she tested negative for dengue. But her sister tested positive for the virus and is admitted to the hospital,” said the resident medical officer of CMCH, Dr A  . “The cases are sporadic but they mainly come from within the corporation limits,” he added.
 
 The number of dengue cases being reported in private hospitals is also high. A multi-speciality hospital on   said it gets at least five new cases daily. “Dengue is usually severe if it’s the second attack on the patient, not matter the prevailing weather condition,” said consultant intensivist, Dr S V Irania.
 
 “Platelet counts start dropping, so almost 80% patients opt for hospitalization, if not intensive care. Cases mainly come from Coimbatore south right up to Pollachi. It has become a year-round endemic disease now,” Irania added.
 
 Doctors blame it on waterlogging and stagnant water in open drainage and sewage lines. “It is common knowledge that dengue is only spread by aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed only in stagnant water in potholes and drains. If summer showers have created potholes, the corporation should take immediate steps to fix the same,” Dr Soundaravel said, adding, “Spraying of larvicide and fogging have to be done more efficiently.”
