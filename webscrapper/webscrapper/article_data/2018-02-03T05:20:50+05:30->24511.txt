NAVI MUMBAI: Areas like New Panvel, Kamothe, Kalamboli and Kharghar have been raising a stink as garbage has been piled up after Cidco stopped collecting garbage from here as it falls under the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC)’s jurisdiction. Cidco has stopped collecting garbage from these four nodes since Thursday.

 However, Cidco broke the impasse by agreeing to continue collecting garbage till March 15 after PCMC requested them. Around 600 MT of garbage has been lying across New Panvel, Kamothe, Kalamboli and Kharghar. Garbage has been lying unattended on the road and dustbins have been overflowing. 
 
 Kharghar resident and activist Ravi Srivastava said, “The PCMC has made no plan since the last 15 months, despite Cidco reminding them. Heaps of garbage has been lying and has been raising a stink. It can also lead to an epidemic. The PCMC is responsible to clear this.”
 
 Meanwhile, Cidco chief health officer B S   said, “The PCMC has requested us to continue collecting garbage till the end of the Swachh Survey, 2018. As the Swachh Survey is a national program we agreed to continue collecting garbage till March 15. This is the final ultimatum given to PCMC. Hence, garbage collection commenced from Friday evening. Normal clearing of garbage will start from Saturday.”
 
  node sanitary inspector   said, “During the internal deliberation at Cidco head office on Friday it was decided to collect garbage.” PCMC Kharghar node superintendent   said, “We had a meeting with Kharghar corporators on garbage segregation on Friday. The deputy municipal commissioner has assured the corporators that Cidco will collect garbage till the end of Swachh Survey.”
