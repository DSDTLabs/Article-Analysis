AHMEDABAD: The   (CBI) on Tuesday registered a complaint against a deputy commissioner of customs at   and an another person in an alleged   of Rs 20 lakh. A   team on Tuesday morning laid a trap at the customs office in Mundra and succeeded in arresting one middleman but the officer gave them the slip.

 Highly-placed sources said, “CBI had registered a case against deputy commissioner of customs S J Singh at Mundra and a private person identified as Hiten Thakkar for demanding a bribe of Rs 30 lakh from the complainant, who is working as customs house agent. The complainant’s company was engaged by an Ahmedabad firm and one of the import consignments of this firm was found to be containing 27kg of gold in July this year. During investigation, Singh had allegedly demanded Rs 40 lakh to clear the names of the relatives of the complainant, including his wife.”
 
 “After negotiation, the demand was reduced to Rs 30 lakh and complainant was allegedly forced to pay Rs 10 lakh in July itself. Singh contacted the complainant on different occasions for delivery of the remaining amount and asked the complainant to give Rs 20 lakh to Thakkar. CBI laid a trap and apprehended Thakkar while accepting Rs 20 lakh on behalf of the deputy commissioner of customs. Singh is absconding,” said sources.
 
 Thakkar will be produced before a local court on Wednesday.
