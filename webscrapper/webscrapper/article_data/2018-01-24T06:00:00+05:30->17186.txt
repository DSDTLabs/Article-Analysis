Ahead of its much-awaited release on Republic Day, the makers of the   Shetty-starrer   organised a mega pre-release event at a star hotel in Hyderabad recently. The event was graced by the film’s crew, including director   and Anushka herself, while actor Nani and producer   were chief guests for the evening. 
Bhaagamathie is Anushka’s first release since last year’s blockbuster film Baahubali: The Conclusion. At the pre-release event, the Arundhati actress said that shooting for this film was one of her most exciting journeys in recent times. “When I first heard the story of the film in 2012, it immediately struck a chord with me. Since dates weren’t available at the time, I couldn’t do it. I’d like to thank the producers for having waited this long to do this film with me,” Anushka said. The actress, who’s featured in several female-centric films including Rudhramadevi and Size Zero, said that there’s more to the film than just her. “This isn’t just an Anushka film. Every member of the crew has put in tremendous effort that can be seen in the final product. This film belongs to all of us,” she said.
