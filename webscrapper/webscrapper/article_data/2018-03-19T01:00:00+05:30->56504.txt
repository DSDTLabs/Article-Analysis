Ranveer Singh’s red-carpet appearances have become a trademark feature of the star, with music blasting from his personal music player. This year, at a popular awards night, the actor walked in, wearing a tuxedo which paid tribute to Bollywood film posters of yore and complementing his attire were the hit 80s Hindi disco tracks blaring from the music player. In other words, Ranveer knows how to arrive in style! Talking of style, he made yet another sartorial statement at a fashion magazine’s awards night recently. With his personal music player in tow, a printed blazer adding oodles of drama and his inimitable flamboyance for all to see, the actor created quite the stir.

 But this time around, his music player helped him impress a “dear friend”. The actor walked into the photo arena of the same event where stars were posing for their photographs for the fashion magazine. His rumoured girlfriend   was standing tall in a white gown, wowing everyone. Seeing Ranveer equipped with a music player, she requested him to play some song to get her into the mood for the photo shoot. Ranveer immediately obliged and inquired what she was in the mood for. Deepika promptly replied, “Play something sexy”. Their chemistry when they posed together for the photo shoot was scorching hot. And yet, they are just friends… 
 
 Time to let the cat out of the bag… officially!
