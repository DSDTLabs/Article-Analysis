GURUGRAM: The school   committee is all set to start its second phase of inspections under which 15 schools will be audited from April 16 to May 4. 

 From April 16-19, the panel would visit three schools, namely   in DLF 4,   in Rajendra Park and Blue Bells Model School in Sector 4. 
 
 However, officials informed TOI that the audit report of the 15 schools that were audited in the first phase would be made public by the district administration on April 20. 
 
 Speaking about the inspections, safety committee member Shweta Sharma said, “Schools should be serious about the audits. People have problems with security checks being declared publicly. Audits are helpful for schools. We are not checking or asking anything new, we are just following the guidelines set by the state education board.” added Shweta. 
 
 Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “The results of the first round of safety audits are being shared with school authorities for correction and will also be put on public domain.”
