Kolkata: Chief minister   Banerjee reached out to her ailing predecessor Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for the second time in a span of six months on Thursday evening, sending out the signal that she never failed in extending courtesy to her political opponents even on the day her partymen in Birbhum injured CPM leader Ramchandra Dom in Nalhati in the run-up to the rural polls.

 Banerjee took time off her busy schedule to call on CMP leader Bhattacharjee at his Palm Avenue home at 6.30pm. She stayed for half an hour until 7pm. Kolkata police commissioner Rajiv Kumar accompanied the CM from Nabanna to the former CM’s place. Bhattacharjee came down to the apartment entrance to see Banerjee off.
 
 “Uni Buddhadeb babu. Ami eshechhilam oke dekhte. Onar songe golpo korlam, khub bhalo laglo. Boudir songeo kotha holo (This is Buddhadeb babu. I came to see how he is doing. It was nice talking to him and his wife),” she said while leaving former CM’s flat. “He was having an eye problem. He has improved. He is absolutely okay now,” Banerjee added. 
 
 The former CM has, however, stopped going to the CPM state headquarters on Alimuddin Street owing to his chronic respiratory distress. Bhattacharjee had attended the CPM state conference with oxygen support but opted out of the new party state committee though party bosses had wanted him to remain as an invitee. 
 
 Trinamool chief Banerjee hasn’t burnt bridges with her former bete noire Bhattacharjee. She had ordered urgent repairs for flat 1 at 59A Palm Avenue, the former CM’s house, that was in a bad shape. She also asked if the housing department — the owner of the property — had started the process of handing over ownership to Bhattacharjee and the other tenants who had been living there for decades. 
 
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation had taken up repairs of leaks in the water tank immediately after. The CM had also offered to shift the Bhattacharjees to another flat in the same building during repairs.
