LUCKNOW: The   ministry's order prescribing jail term and penalty on clinical establishments failing to notify tuberculosis ( ) cases came into effect on Thursday. 

 While tuberculosis was made a notifiable disease in India in 2012, there was no provision for penal action. TB kills an estimated 4.8 lakh Indians every year. Of these, one fifth are from UP. 
 
 "The gazette order says failure by a clinical establishments to notify a tuberculosis patient to a nodal officer and local public health staff can be punished with a jail term of six months to two years under the provisions of sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life)," said state TB officer said Dr Alok Ranjan. 
 
  Lucknow district TB control officer Dr   said, "The list includes hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, diagnostic services, including those by a single doctor. On the contrary, informing the administration about TB cases attended to will fetch an incentive."
