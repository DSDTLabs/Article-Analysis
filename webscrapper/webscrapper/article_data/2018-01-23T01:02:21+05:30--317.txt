Alwar: The bypoll campaign for   parliamentary seat has intensified with leaders of both the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress leaving no stone unturned to win the seat. It is a prestige for the ruling BJP as the seat was held by the BJP and a defeat just a few months before the state assembly elections would erode the image of the party and chief minister Vasundhara Raje .

 The opposition Congress sees it as an opportunity and a win before the assembly election will boost the partyâ€™s morale and confidence.
 
 While chief minister Vasundhara Raje continued to meet leaders of various caste groups in Tijara and Neemrana and Union minister Arjunlal Meghwal also joined the campaign for the party candidate Jaswant Yadav. The Congress has roped in Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav in the campaign. He will address public meetings in support of party candidate Karan Singh Yadav on Tuesday.
 
 Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Mahila Congress national president Sushmita Dev campaigned for the party in Alwar on Monday. Sushmita Dev alleged that the Modi government has turned out to be a failure on all fronts. The border firing and killing of jawans has become the order of the day on the border and the central government had failed control terror and back money, she alleged.
 
 She said what the central government could deliver was price rise, GST, demonitisation and corruption. She asked the people of Rajasthan to give a fitting reply to the breach of promise by the Modi and Raje governments in the by poll by defeating the BJP candidates.
 
 She alleged that Raje government has discontinued pro-poor schemes launched by the previous Congress government under Ashok Gehlot.
 
 The BJP has been on the back foot after the party replaced the chief minister Vasundhara Raje hoardings with that of the Prime minister at many places in the constituency.
