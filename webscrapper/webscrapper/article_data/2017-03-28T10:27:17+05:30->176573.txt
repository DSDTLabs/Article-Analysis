KOLKATA: The   government has come up with a plan to develop a   tourism circuit around Fraserganj, Chandanpiri and Henry’s Island. Visitors will not only be taken to the sea sides, but they will also be educated in pisciculture, fish cuisine, angling and boating.

 The   (SFDC) is working on plans for this tourism circuit package. “Eco tourism is already a hit. Prodded by the chief minister, we now want to develop fish tourism in the coastal places,” said an SFDC official. 
 
 Officials said it will be an aqua-cum-nature tourism circuit, in which visitors will be able to visit the sites where the river meets the sea and will be able to see how fish farming is carried out in these remote coastal places. Visitors will also be offered various sea fish at affordable prices,” the official added. 
 
 Officials said they have already introduced fish cuisine and angling opportunities in some places. “The idea is to give people an idea of pisciculture,” said SFDC managing director Soumyajit Das. 
 
 According to plans, visitors will first reach Henry’s Island, where they will be staying. They will be offered an opportunity to take a tour of the place in an e-rickshaw, accompanied by an SFDC official. 
 
 The visitors will also be taken to remote fish bheries where they will get a first-hand experience of fish farming. 
 
 From Henry’s Island, visitors will be taken to Chandanpiri for a view of the coastal line from a watch tower and a visit to the crocodile sanctuaries. 
 
 After Chandanpiri, the tour will move to fish processing units at Fraserganj. The visitors will then be brought back to Henry’s Island, where they will be offered lunch comprising various fish dishes. Angling and boating services will be offered so the visitors can spend some leisure time before returning home.
 
 “The rate of the package will be as nominal as possible so as to attract the maximum number of visitors,” an official said.
