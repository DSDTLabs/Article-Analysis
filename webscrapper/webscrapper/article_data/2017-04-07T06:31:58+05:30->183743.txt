PUNE: The Pune division of the central railways is planning to change the timings of the newly launched diesel multiple unit ( ) between Pune and   following teething problems faced by the rakes since their inauguration on March 25.

 “The headquarters in Mumbai wanted the new train to be launched without any delay and as   minister   was in   on March 25, it was decided to launch the service from there. So, the timings and other aspects were decided and it seems there was a bit of ahurry. The problems have been continuing since the services started. A proposal regarding the new time table is being sent to the headquarters for approval,“ an official told TOI requesting anonymity.
 
 Just four days after the train was launched, it couldn't get diesel due to refilling issues at Daund. The next day , the train got delayed with officials citing rake link failure. The train from Pune to Daund was 80 minutes late while the rake from Daund to Pune was an hour late. On Friday , the train was cancelled due to some technical issues and Railway officials said the DMU ran late even on Monday . “We had a discussion with the operations department and have proposed a complete revamp of the timing, which includes the train setting off from Daund, which comes under   division, at 5 am.There are many express trains which pass through the same route throughout the day, thus delaying the DMU. If the train starts from Daund at 5 am, the present time table will change completely . The proposal will be finalised and sent by Wednesday,“ the official added.
 
 Officials added that the adapter required to refuel the train would be installed at Daund by Wednesday.
 
 “On Tuesday, the train was delayed by 25 minutes“, the official said.
