 and winter go hand in hand. Falling temperatures, chilly winds and change of temperature can take a toll on your skin. Time to take care of it. Try these simple tips.

 1. 
 
 
 Regular and periodic use of moisturisers is a must. Some face cleaners have added moisturisers, which can work for men with oily or normal skin. But if you have dry skin, use a lotion after your bath – and definitely at night. To keep your skin hydrated, apply the cream post face wash.
 
 2. 
 
 Try on some liquid cleansers for the face and body. Liquid cleansers are mild. Also, go easy on scrubbing during winter.
 
 3. 
  
 Lukewarm water instead of hot water baths will keep your skin hydrated and nourished. Hot water baths are tempting in winter but they hit your skin hard. Very hot water evaporates quickly and dehydrates the skin, which is why we recommend you keep the water lukewarm. Apply a moisturiser within 5 minutes of getting out of the shower.
 
 4. 
 
 Pick out a lip balm to avoid chapping. Lips are quick to dry in winter. That is why lip balms are a must. The balms should have SPF which will keep your lips moisturised and also protect it from the sun. Keep one handy in your backpack.
 
 5. 
 
 Even though it’s cold, sunscreens are a must to protect the face from strong UV rays. Cold weather does not mean you are relieved from the strong ultra-violet rays. If you plan to head out, apply sunscreen 20 minutes prior.
