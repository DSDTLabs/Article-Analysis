HYDERABAD: Tipplers caught by the traffic cops during   checks are giving them a tough time. On Saturday, police had a hard time intercepting two drunk drivers, who tried to run away from the spot by abandoning their vehicles.

 Police booked 65 cases in   on Saturday night and seized 37 cars and 28 motorcycles. Near Jubilee Hills checkpost, two offenders tried to flee, but the traffic police managed to chase and intercept them. 
 
 "Fearing that their family members will come to know about the incident and they might even have to go to jail, the two men tried to escape abandoning their vehicles at the checkpost, but we intercepted them," a traffic police official said.
 
 The offenders have to appear for counselling at   (TTI) in   or Goshamahal. After the counselling, they will be produced before the court. If the Blood Alcohol Count (BAC) is more than 30 mg/100 ml, a case of drunk driving will be registered against them and if the BAC is above 150 mg/100 ml, they are likely to be sent to jail.
 
 Recently, a local court suspended the driving license of TV anchor M   for three years and imposed a fine for driving in a drunken condition on January 1.
