VISAKHAPATNAM: Vizagites are in for a visual celestial treat on January 3 and 4. Meteor showers, Mars-Moon conjunction and perihelion or Earth closest to the Sun are all slated to happen between January 3 night and 4.
During conjunction, celestial bodies appear near one another in the sky. On January 3, planet Mars and Earth’s satellite Moon can be seen with the naked eye and would appear near each other as seen from Earth. According to the   (PSI), if one looks towards the west at sunset, one would see a crescent moon and just below it is a faint non-twinkling red star like object — Mars. 
 
 The second celestial event is the Quadrantids Meteor Shower. “The annual meteor shower visible from Dec 28 to January 12 will peak on January 3 and 4. If one looks at the sky away from city lights between east and north direction from 3.30 am onwards, one can see bright streaks of light zipping across the sky. This shower is called   because bright streaks seem to emanate from the constellation wherein the radiant of this meteor shower lies. Telescopes/binoculars are not required to see this event. As per International Meteor Organization, ZHR ( ) for this annual shower is 120 meteors. However 25-50 meteors per hour is predicted,” informed director and founder secretary of  . 
 
 Finally, on January 4, planet Earth will be at its closest point to the Sun in its elliptical orbit at 0.9833 AU (147100992 km approximately). Astronomically, this phenomena is known as Perihelion. On July 4, Earth will be at Aphelion at 1.016 AU (152092504 km approx), that is the farthest point from the Sun.
