COIMBATORE: The state highways department is all set to invite tenders for flyover between Ukkadam and Athupalam in three days. “We expect the government nod to invite tenders for the project in three days,” said a source.

 The state government had already allotted Rs121.82 crore for the construction of the 1.7km-long four-lane flyover and another Rs88.61 crore for land acquisition.
 
 To project was announced by former chief minister the late J Jayalalithaa in 2011 to reduce the traffic congestion on Ukkdam-Athupalam stretch. A detailed project report was prepared in September 2014, but the project didn’t take off as the state government did not take any steps to initiate work on the project.
 
 The flyover, as per the plan, would have two grade separators to link Ukkadam Junction to   and Sungam Bypass Road. To implement the project, the state government has to acquire 18,526.97sqm of private land and 13,291.75sqm government land.
 
 “The district revenue officials had last year issued notifications to private land owners. After that the officials had not taken any steps. So, the project is delayed,” said a source with the state highways department.
 
 The four-lane flyover, the source said, would start from Oppanakkara Street (near old  ) and end near Athupalam toll plaza. One grade separator of the flyover would start from   and end near   (TNSCT) depot on Sungam Bypass Road. The second grade separator would start from Ukkadam Junction and end near the fish market on Perur Bypass Road.
 
 “The city corporation and the revenue department failed to acquire land for the project. If they don’t speed up the entire process, the project will be delayed further” the source said.
