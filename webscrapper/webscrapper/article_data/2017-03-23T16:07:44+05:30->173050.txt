After giving us the title track ‘Uff yeh Noor’, the makers of ‘Noor’ have dropped the latest song ‘Gulabi 2.0’. A reprised version of the chartbuster ‘Gulabi aankhen’ from ‘The Train’, this song is a complete party number. 

 ‘Gulabi 2.0’ sees 
  aka   undergo a transformation of sorts from the innocent workaholic to a crazy party hopper. In her own words, she goes from “seedhi Savitri” to “tedhi Savitri” as she downs a few shots and dances with complete abandon. The song also features Shibani Dandekar, Kanan Gill and Purab Kohli. ‘Gulabi 2.0’ has been recreated by Amaal Mallik. The lyrics are by Kumaar and the song has been sung by Tulsi Kumar, Yash Narvekar and Amaal himself.
 
 Directed by Sunhil Sippy, the film is based on the novel ‘Karachi, You're Killing Me!’ Noor’ is all set to hit theatres on April 21.
