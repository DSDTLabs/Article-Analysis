KOLHAPUR: The  , Kolhapur (SUK) has asked the affiliated colleges across the division to take utmost care while uploading the All India Survey on Higher   ( ) data. In a circular on February 27, it has asked its affiliated colleges that the Ministry of Human Resource Development ( ) has shown concerns over the poor and erroneous data uploading from the colleges across the country and that more authenticity and care should be taken while going for the task, it said.

 The university has attached the letter from the University Grants Commission ( ) secretary, Jaspal Sandhu, dated January 25, which states that “It has been informed by the MHRD that during 2015-16, the response of the institutions of higher education was very high and the majority of institutions submitted consistent data. However, while scrutinising the data for 2015-16, instances of erroneous/incorrect uploading of data by some of the institutions have been observed either inadvertently or due to lack of seriousness on the part of the individual institutions in uploading the data on AISHE portal, which is a matter of concern.”
