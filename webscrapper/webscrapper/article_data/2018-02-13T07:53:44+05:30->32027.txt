LUCKNOW: The   said on Monday that it did not have any   to   among  

 The submission came from chief minister   in a written response to query raised by SP member Shashank Yadav in the legislative council, who had enquired if the government had directed officials or NGOs to devise strategy to control tendency of violence among the youth.
 
 Though the issue could not be taken up following repeated disruptions by the opposition over the death of a Dalit youth in Allahabad, the government submitted that it had set up ‘Open Ashray Homes’ where streetchildren are fed and taken care of to prevent them from becoming violent.
 
 Yogi said that under the Child Protection scheme, the state government has set up district level committees which visit schools, squatters in various blocks and panchayats to counsel children. Besides, Childline India has started a toll free number 1098 where people can lodge complaints of child rights violations.
 
 Yadav told TOI that the issue he wanted to take up was pertinent from the point of view of recent cases of violence by youngsters. He cited the recent incidents of a 11-year-old girl attacking a six-year-old boy in a Lucknow school and a class 12 student killing his mother and sister in Noida.
 
 “It is surprising that the state government still has no strategy in place despite the rise in the number of cases of violence by youth,” he said. Yadav had also asked if the state government had any plans to set up a separate ministry to control such incidents.
