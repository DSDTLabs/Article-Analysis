Thiruvananthapuram:   management has asked its regional transport authority (RTA) monitoring cell to submit a report on the delay in implementation of the   for Bus Routes (UNSBR) for   plying in the district. 

 The UNSB uses alphanumeric characters indicating the route and destination of the buses. Designed by the students of department of management studies (DMS), Kannur University, the project was proposed to be implemented in association with district tourism promotional council and district administration.
 
 According to an official from RTA cell of KSRTC, it was following a suggestion received from a passenger to expedite the implementation of the route numbering system in buses that the RTA cell was directed to submit a report on the delay in implementation of the project.
 
 “The delay is due to fund crunch. Also, in view of the smart city project, a new proposal on LED screens is being considered. These screens will be used to display destinations. It is estimated that the cost for LED screen display for a bus could range from Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000. The total expenditure for the project including installation charges is estimated at Rs 40 lakh. In the present financial situation, it will be unviable for the transport corporation to fund the project,” said the KSRTC official in-charge of UNSBR.
 
 “The RTA cell will be submitting the new proposal to the tourism department and district administration. We also hope to present the project in the meeting held for Smart City,” added the official.
