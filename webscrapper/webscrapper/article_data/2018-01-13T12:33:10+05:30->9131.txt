 Spodek was speaking at Ahmedabad University on Friday, on the theme: ‘What do we do next? Building on Ahmedabad’s   World Heritage Award’. 
 
 He said that unchecked traffic growth, lack of parking spaces, noise pollution, garbage and trash dumped randomly; and lack of proper sanitation facilities continue to be pressing concerns in the walled city, whether it is a heritage city or not. 
 
 “In Ahmedabad’s walled city, heritage exists in physical reality. Restoring and beautifying a building will not help unless its surroundings are clean and accessible. Problems such as garbage, water supply and traffic, among others, especially in the walled city area, must be addressed by the civic body on a priority,” said Spodek. He also cited a 2014 study on ‘Re-imagining Manek Chowk’.
 
  
  Spodek also highlighted two crucial aspects of effective heritage management in the world heritage city – coming up with a better tourism policy and encouraging people’s participation. 
 
 Citing the example of how city-based   (MHT) had roped-in women in Dhal ni Pol to turn to heritage conservation, Spodek emphasized that people’s participation is crucial in heritage management. 
 
 “When people take tride in what they do, their efforts are bound to be sustainable,” he said. “Roping in Pol residents to help conserve heritage reflects public will in the effort.”
 
 Spodek also referred to the development and heritage management of Philadelphia after it was awarded the coveted UNESCO World Heritage City status. 
 
 Hailing the entrepreneurial spirit of Gujaratis, Spodek also emphasized on entrepreneurs exploring business opportunities in heritage tourism.
