NEW DELHI: Ravinder Kaur has stopped taking calls on her phone while on the road. Last November, while returning from her son's coaching classes, the 36-year-old woman had felt a tug on her neck only to find her gold chain gone. She saw two men riding away, her chain held aloft by the pillion rider. Her screams alerted people, who caught one of them. Kaur today is suspicious about every motorcycle that passes her.

 “I now keep something for my protection, something like a pepper spray,” said Kaur. “Even if I manage to catch a snatcher, it will take some time for the police to arrive and I should be able to defend myself during this time.”
 
 Many other victims of   exhibit similar anxieties for a long time. In December 2017, two men snatched Abhay Singh’s smartphone near Connaught Place. “I grabbed one of men but was dragged for a distance before I tripped and fell. And ever since I dread using a phone on the road,” said the phone shop employee. Singh also now only uses a basic feature phone.
 
 DU student Sneha too is unable to shake off her nervousness every time a two-wheeler slows down behind her. She lost her phone when on her way to a metro station and the snatchers came on a bike and snatched device from her hand.
 
 Mental health experts say that the surprise attack and loss of personal items leave a victim worrying about his or her safety. “It is imperative to reassure a victim of snatching and to counsel them,” said mental health expert Jayanti Dutta. She has been counselling an elderly woman for a year since she was similarly attacked by snatchers in central Delhi. “The pensioner did not let go of her purse because it contained bank pass books and cheques,” said Dutta.
