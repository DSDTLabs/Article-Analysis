 Speaking to TOI, superintendent of railway police KV Mohan   said they mostly receive tip-offs on such incidents and admitted that it is difficult to anticipate who possesses gold in their luggage. “Once we find such large amount of gold being transported without any bills we would then surrender it to commercial tax and income tax officials for further action,” Rao told TOI. It may not be easy to smuggle gold in flights but it is certainly easy to do so in trains and even buses. Police sources said that there were cases where jewelers would procure the gold in black to evade taxes and they would easily transport it via the rail route.

Cops said that there are gangs who work full-time in transporting contraband including psychotropic substances. The jewellers hire them as help who generally prefer taking rail routes.   stands as a major transit point where officials nab the miscreants based on tip-offs. To create more awareness on the issue, railway police force conducted a programme for all ticket examination staff in Vijayawada division where they explained various modus operandi of crimes.
