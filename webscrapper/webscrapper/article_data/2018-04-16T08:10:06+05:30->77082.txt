My mother is a fashion exporter so I was always into fashion and that is how I got into pageanting but acting happened accidentally.

I felt that I should be associated with a film that has some social message, which is why I went for this. But I’m not thinking too far ahead right now.”

But now, I have grown to like the place. The people here are so simple and friendly. My neighbours realised that this girl does not know many people around so they made it a point to make me feel welcome and comfortable. Not a lot of cities are like that.”
