THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Though   is a follower of Gandhiji and Swami Vivekananda, she shed the concept of ahimsa during the launch of  , a ‘digital public space for women’ on Tuesday. “I want women to fight back in case their children are sexually abused. You may ask why I speak the language of violence. But even if it is a poor deer, it will fight back against a lion to protect its kids,” she said.

 Sugathakumari said that all she is left with is concern, guilt and deep sorrow after serving more than 40 years in the public sphere. “We used to ask girls to learn karate and fight back the attackers. But what will one do when the attackers are from within the family. Relations as pure as that of a grandfather and a child have been corrupted,” she said.
