Mumbai: Members of the passenger   committee visited Bandra   station for a review on Thursday. 

 Sources said that the members stressed the need to construct free washrooms at the station. At present, the use of urinals is not charged, but a visit to the   costs Rs 2 while the   facility comes at Rs 5. 
 
 Post-GST, the railway authorities are likely to increase the charges, said sources.
 
 The   members, accompanied by BJP MLA  , discussed the issue of raising the height of platforms across stations. 
 
 There had been complaints from commuters that the raw material used for raising the height of platforms was not of good quality. The committee asked the authorities to send the material used to a laboratory for testing and submit a report soon, said sources.
