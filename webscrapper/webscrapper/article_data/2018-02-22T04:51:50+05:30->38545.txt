MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India governor   in the monetary policy committee meeting earlier last month had said that there are several signs of growth impulses strengthening. However, he has also cautioned about the high   `crowding out’ private investment.

 
 The 'crowding out’ effect refers to a situation where high government borrowing results in lesser funds being available for private investments such that it dampens the initial increase of total investment spending.
 
 In the minutes of   released on Wednesday, Patel said that in addition to creating inflationary pressures the “high fiscal deficit has attendant “crowding-out” implications with regard to the cost of private domestic credit”.
 
 Despite the growth impulses the governor said that the recovery was nascent and needed to be protected compelling him to vote for keeping interest rates on hold.
 
 On the growth impulses, Patel had said that manufacturing activity has picked up with the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) expanding for the sixth consecutive month in January, led by new orders. “There are also early signs of revival of investment activity. Many service sector indicators have shown robust growth such as commercial vehicle sales, domestic & international air passenger traffic, and foreign tourist arrivals,” said Patel.
