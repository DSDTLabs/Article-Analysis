LUCKNOW:  ,   of  , on Thursday submitted a written complaint at   against  , the sacked executive committee member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) alleging that he demanded Rs 5,000 crore, 200 acres of land and a Rajya Sabha seat for helping in out of-court settlement for Ayodhya dispute.

 Police had not converted the complaint into an FIR till late evening even as Nadwi denied the allegations.
 
 Circle officer (CO) of Mahanagar, Anurag Singh, said, “The matter will be investigated thoroughly and FIR be lodged only after taking legal opinion.”
 
 The controversy erupted on Wednesday night, when Mishra claimed that Nadwi had asked him to convey his demands to PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.
 
 Mishra said, “I was there in Nadwa on February 5 at 9.45am to meet Maulana Nadwi and now he is saying he doesn’t even know me. My call records, phone location and footage of CCTV cameras at Nadwa should be checked to ascertain my presence.”
 
 While all attempts to contact Maulana Nadwi on Thursday failed, he told a news channel, “Some people are creating controversies. They are playing Satan, creating obstacles in way of peace. People like Mishra have poisoned hearts who neither want temple nor mosque. This is mischief since my views have drawn support from 90% Muslims and Hindus. These people don’t want this unity. As for money, it has always been at my family’s feet, and I don’t want any of it.”
