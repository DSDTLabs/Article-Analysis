The deposit rates of banks have reduced, but the inter est rate of small savings schemes continue to remain high. Small savings rates were linked to bond yields in 2012. In April 2016, the government decided reset them every quarter instead of once a year. However, though bond yields have declined 65-100 basis points since April 2016, the government has not reduced the rates of small savings to the same degree. The interest rate on the PPF is almost 60 basis points higher that it should be and the Senior Citizen's Saving Scheme offers 8.5% interest instead of 8.1%.According to the RBI these high rates keeps banks from attracting deposits. This, in turn, prevents the reduction in policy rates from translating into lower lending rates. Banks will be in a better position to pass on rate cuts to borrowers if the government adheres to the prescribed formula for adjusting the rates of small savings schemes However, experts believe the scenario is not likely to change soon. “The government will be in no hurry to remove this anomaly .

 Given the absence of a dependable social security net in the country, thousands of people rely on these instruments to generate income or build savings,“ says  , CEO, Wiseinvest Advisors. Manoj Nagpal, CEO, Outlook Asia Capital, feels the government erred in opting for a quarterly reset of rates. “The committeesuggested formula of a yearly reset makes sense. Small savings instruments should be positioned to smoothen out the interest rate fluctuations, rather than witness volatility.“
