RAJKOT: A court in   convicted Rajesh Chaturani, husband of former   women wing executive  , of the murder of Vadodara unit   vice president Manjit Gyanchandani and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. 

 Gyanchandani was murdered at Gandhidham in June 2015. 
 
 According to facts put before the court, Taruna had an affair with Manjit and he was pressurizing her to get divorce from Chaturani so that they could get married. However, Taruna did not want to end her marriage and she called Manjit to Gandhidham to discuss this issue. According to the police report submitted to the court, when Rajesh came home he got furious on seeing Manjit with his wife. In a fit of rage, he stabbed Manjit seven times and killed him on the spot.
 
 Hiteshi Gadhvi, assistant public prosecutor, told TOI: “The defence argued that Rajesh attacked in self-defense but examining the evidence submitted by prosecution, the court rejected this argument. However, the court did not consider our argument that it was an intentional murder and held him guilty for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.”
 
 V A Buddha, additional sessions judge at Gandhidham, sentenced Rajesh to 10-year imprisonment.
 
 In the initial investigation, police suspected Taruna’s role in the murder because she had confessed in her statement that she had called Manjit to Gandhidham. However, during investigation, police could not find any such evidence to submit in the court. After the murder, Rajesh escaped and Taruna had called the police.
