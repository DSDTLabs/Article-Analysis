This evening, the who’s who of the Kannada film industry will congregate for the second edition of the   (KAFTA), to honour the best talent in the technical crew of films. Presented by   in association with   and supported by none other than Rocking Star  , this year the event will spread across 17 pertinent categories. “Most award nights are about celebrating stars and ensuring TRPs by having big names in attendance. We fail to acknowledge that no film will be complete without its technical team, and in that sense,   is the perfect platform to bridge this gap,” says Yash, who has been at the forefront of putting together the event.

 Actress  , who is prioritizing the event over a family reunion, is only too happy to be at Times KAFTA. “The technical crew of a film is its backbone and any project can falter if it is not technically strong. It is, therefore, important that we show them due respect,” she says.
 
 “It is one of the best intiatives that   has come up with. As actors, we are seen on the screen, but the people who make us look good always remain behind the scenes. Without their technical support, we wouldn’t be here, and it is only prudent that we honour them for that,” says actor Tilak.
