HYDERABAD: Devotees can directly travel by train to the famous Lord Rama temple in   if the Telangana government has its way. The state government is seeking extension of the railway line from Kothagudem (Bhadrachalam road rail station) to Bhadrachalam town, a 16-km distance. By road the distance from Kothagudem to the temple town is about 40 km. 

 Roads and buildings minister   requested South Central Railway general manager   to send the state request to the Railway Board for its approval to conduct a survey for extension of the line. Speaking to TOI after the meeting with the railway officials, the minister said his ambition was to see that people coming to have the darshan of Lord Rama get down from train at Bhadrachalam. 
 
 "The rail connectivity to Bhadrachlam temple will be a reality in the TRS regime. Earlier when I was minister in the undivided AP cabinet, I had written letters to the railway ministry. I had taken up the matter Bandaru Dattatreya when he was minister of state for railways and later  . Now, I want the project to be revived and completed on a war footing," he said. 
 
 On the Bhadrachalam-Sattupalli rail line, officials said over 500 acres of land is required and the minister asked them to start the acquisition process in a day or two.
