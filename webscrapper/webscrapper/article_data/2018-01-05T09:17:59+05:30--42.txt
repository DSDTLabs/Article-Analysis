LUCKNOW: As violent clashes between Dalits and rightwing groups in   village in Pune continue to gain political overtones, Dalit organisation BAMCEF on Thursday threatened to launch a ‘jihad’ (struggle to improve oneself and society) over alleged rising incidents of atrocities on Dalits and Muslims on Thursday.

 The Backward and   (BAMCEF), founded by BSP founder   44 years ago, has largely preferred working silently among Dalits and other oppressed classes, but it said it would carry out a nationwide agitation through its students’ and workers’ offshoots if the government was not able to stop incidents of violence against Dalits.
 
 Kanshiram’s close aide and BAMCEF member Daya Ram said the organization was planning to send a memorandum to the President and to the United Nations. The memorandum, he said, would comprise a detailed list of incidents of violence such as the   caste conflagration, flogging of a Dalit youth in Una, lynching of Akhlaq and suicide of Hyderabadbased Dalit scholar  .
 
 “Our members would directly meet district magistrates across Maharashtra, UP and Gujarat and hand over the memorandum,” he said.
 
 “Those who inflict injuries on Dalits and the oppressed sections are being patronized. There is a hidden agenda of depriving the backward of their due reservation right. We will not let this happen any more, and launch a jihad,” he said.
