Surat: Police arrested a 25-year-old resident of Haryana for allegedly appearing as a dummy candidate for a registered candidate in the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) examination here on Sunday.  Accused Paras Ranbir Sangwan, who is from Dangroli village in Bhiwani district of Haryana, was nabbed by the examination supervisor. Police also booked Jogendar Ramishan Singh, 23, a resident of Kharkhari of Bhiwani, for whom Sangwan was appearing in the multi-talking non-technical examination conducted at many places on Sunday for a class IV level job. The accused came for the examination from Haryana. He sat in the classroom at the Experimental School and during checking, the supervisor found the photo on the call letter to be that of some other person. He informed school principal Minakshi Vakhariya, who also examined the documents of Sangwan. The school authorities called police and lodged a complaint against him for appearing on someone else’s behalf. “Both the accused are giving various tests and preparing for competitive examinations. We are yet to find out under what condition had the accused agreed to appear for another candidate,” police said.
