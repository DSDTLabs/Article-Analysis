 “I was happy looking after the home and taking care of our son. Now circumstances have dragged me out of home. This is a new challenge. I am ready to learn. I am also confident of living up to the new responsibility,” she said. 
 
 On her first day at work, the higher secondary passout was accompanied by Trinamool workers from her locality who had also stood by her. “Apart from Didi, I am indebted to MP Abhishek Banerjee and also Shantanu da (Shantanu Banerjee, Hooghly district youth   president). I have always stayed away from politics. Ironically, they showed me the way in these difficult times,” Rubi said.
