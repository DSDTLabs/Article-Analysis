JODHPUR:   actor   was today acquitted of all charges in the Arms Act case against him in the alleged poaching of two black bucks.

 "Salman Khan (has been) acquitted in the Arms Act case after the prosecution failed to provide conclusive evidence," the film star's lawyer said, ANI reported.
 
 A case against the film star was registered in October 1998 under the Arms Act for his alleged use and possession of arms with an expired license during the alleged poaching of two black bucks in   village. 
 
 Salman's 0.22 rifle and 0.32 revolver had expired licenses and cases were filed under Sections 3/25 and 3/27. The maximum sentence in Section 3/25 is usually three years while Section 3/27 has seven years as the maximum sentence.
 
 The film star was present in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (Jodhpur district), where the verdict was pronounced. He arrived in Jodhpur yesterday with his sister Alveera and his advocates. 
 
 Hailing the decision defense counsel H M Saraswat said "the court admitted our arguments that Khan was framed in this case as he had no concrete evidence against him."
 
 On the other hand, the prosecution counsel BS Bhati said they would appeal against the acquittal in the sessions court.
 
 According to the prosecution counsel Bhawani Singh Bhati, the arguments in the case were completed on January 9 in the trial court and the order had been reserved by the magistrate to be pronounced today.
 
 During the arguments, while the defence had argued that there was no evidence against   in the case and he was framed by the forest department, the prosecution argued that there were adequate evidence against the film star for the use and possession of the arms with an expired license.
 
 Of the four cases against him, Khan has already been acquitted in two cases of poaching by the high court while a third case of poaching is in its final stage.
