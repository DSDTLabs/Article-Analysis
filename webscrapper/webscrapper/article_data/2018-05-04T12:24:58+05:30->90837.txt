HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court has upheld the claim of the Telangana Housing Board over a 20-acre plot and rejected belated claims raised by one   over the land. 

 Concluding that 20 acres of 600 acres of land, falling under survey number 1009 in  , was acquired by the housing board in 1968 itself, the bench of Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta was critical of revenue authorities whose actions created some confusion and raised scope for private parties to stake ineligible claims.
 
 "In our opinion, revenue authorities had completely misdirected in law in reopening a factual issue that had been settled way back in 1968 if not earlier and there was no occasion for reopening that factual issue after a lapse of at least 25 years. That being the position, it cannot be said that the courts are precluded from interfering in a matter of determination of facts when the authorities have completely misdirected themselves in   which did not vest in them. We therefore also reject this submission of the private claimants," Justice Lokur, who wrote the order for the bench, said.
 
 Giving finding on claims of the private parties, the bench said, "The belated claim made under Section 87 of the Act was made after a period of at least 25 years. This can hardly be described as a reasonable period. There is no explanation for the inordinate delay and to make matters worse, third party interests have been created through a housing scheme developed on the land in dispute or in any event on the surrounding land. After a further lapse of 25 years, it is not possible to put the clock back, even if there is any reason to do so, which reason we cannot even visualise in this case," the bench said.
 
  authorities appreciated efforts put in by   in ensuring a victory for the Housing Board in the Supreme Court.
