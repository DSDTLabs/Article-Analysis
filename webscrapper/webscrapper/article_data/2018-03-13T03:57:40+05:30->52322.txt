MUMBAI: A decade after two unauthorized floors of a   were regularised by the then municipal commissioner, the BMC in an about-turn now wants to revoke the regularisation of the structures. The matter was mentioned for an urgent hearing before the Bombay high court on Monday. A division bench of Justice   and Justice Riyaz Chagla told the BMC that it would have to hear the developer before taking a decision on whether to revoke an order legalising the two top floors. 

 The court was hearing a petition filed by the developer who constructed   in   (W). The BMC had issued a commencement certificate to construct a building up to 14 floors. However, two additional floors were constructed. The developer applied for regularisation on the grounds that it had construction rights in the form of Floor Space Index available for the 15th and 16th floor. In July 2007, the civic chief used his discretionary powers to regularise the structures. The regularisation was, however, conditional to approval of the civil aviation ministry. As per a report by the  , it had identified over 400 structures as "obstacles" around the airport. While the rules say obstacles in the approach and take-off paths as well as transitional areas cannot be regularised, the other buildings can be subject to an aeronautical study. 
 
 According to advocate S C Naidu, the aeronautical study required for an NOC was not done. In 2017, an internal note was placed on record by the BMC for revoking the permission to regularise the two top floors. The petition sought quashing of the internal note and an aeronautical study for the building. The bench pointed out that an internal note could not be quashed and if a final decision was not taken by the BMC, the corporation was bound to hear the developer before taking a final decision.
