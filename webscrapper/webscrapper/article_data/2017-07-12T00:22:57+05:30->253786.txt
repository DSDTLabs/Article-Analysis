Ambala: The cantonment board here has been adding various projects, including smart schools, wi-fi facilities and open gyms, in its plan for ‘Smart Cantonment’ project. Now, in a bid to free the area under the cantonment from stray cattle, the board has reclassified and proposed to set up a cow shelter on 3.75 acres, along with a biogas plant.

 Officials said that the proposal was not new as it had been proposed in 2006 as well but had been now sent again to the ministry of defence after reclassifying and adding it to the project of ‘Smart Cantonment’. The proposal was made in a bid to clear the area of stray cattle and give them a proper shelter, along with utilising the waste that would be produced in the cow shelter. Land had been selected near Tundla village for the purpose of setting it up.
 
 The proposed 3.75 acres have been selected on the Topkhana-Panjokhra road. A biogas plant would be installed in the cow shelter as well for the production of biogas as well as bio-fertilisers. The plant would run on the waste generated in the cow shelter. Talking to TOI, CEO of the Ambala Cantonment Board, Varun Kalia said that, “Actually the proposal is not very new. It was initially proposed about 10 years back but has been again sent to the ministry of defence after including it in the ‘Smart Cantonment’ plan.”
 
 “The cow shelter will clear the area of stray cows and will be set up on 3.75 acres. We have proposed to set up a biogas plant in the   as well,” Kalia added.
