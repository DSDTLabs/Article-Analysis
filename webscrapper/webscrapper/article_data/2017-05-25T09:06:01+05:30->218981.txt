CHANDIGARH: If you are planning to take a train ride on the Unseco world heritage   track in the next few weeks, you are probably too late.The number of passengers travelling on the narrow gauge has shot up 30% as compared to last year, while the waiting list is between 70 and 100 for the next fortnight, according to railway officials. The addition of two special trains apart from six others has failed to lessen the rush that espe cially peaks during the summer vacation.

 Sources says that there are two general trains in which one has three coaches and another five. These two have unreserved coaches and tourists opt for its services during non-availability of seats in other trains commuting on this route.
 
 The   has a waiting list from 70 to 100 from May 25 to June 6. It has six coaches instead of seven as per the norms. A summer special introduced for June and July also has six coaches.
 
 Officials says that on an average a single coach as capacity of 30 to 38 seats. Sources say 26 coaches are lying in the workshop due to non-availability of wheels and brass with the authorities. As a result, trains are not running according to the rake line norms.   commercial divisional manager Parveen Gaur, however, says a majority of trains running between Kalka and Shimla have seven coaches and there is 100% occupancy this year. She says special summer trains are already in place to clear the rush in the next two months.
