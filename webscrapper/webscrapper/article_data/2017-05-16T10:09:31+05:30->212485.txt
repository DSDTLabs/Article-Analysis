VIJAYAWADA: The   government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Singapore consortium to develop the   here on Monday. 

 The capital city will come up on 1,691 acres land on the banks of Krishna river. "Amaravati will be a world class city attractive than Singapore," said the chief minister. The city will come up on both sides of Krishna river. He further lauded the Singapore consortium for submitting three conceptual master plans within days of receiving Andhra Pradesh government's request. 
 
 "We took more time than expected to start the work due to hurdles from the opposition parties," alleged Andhra Pradesh chief minister. "We created history by pooling 33,000 acres land worth nearly 40,000 crore before spending on the construction. No government in the world has pooled to such a massive extent within six months. Farmers gave up their land because they had faith in me. I bow my head before them," said Naidu. "Amaravati means the city of goddesses. We are committed to creating heaven on earth," said the chief minister.
