Panaji: Having seen an approximately 10-15% rise in yield after using transplanters to sow seeds over the past three seasons, the agriculture department is now in the process of procuring about 20-25 more machines from corporates to ease cultivation and irrigation.

 Transplanters are used for mechanized weeding and inline sowing of seeds. They consume lesser seeds compared to manual sowing.
 
 Despite there being a subsidy in place under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana for those interested in purchasing transplanters for agricultural activities, only five machines are in used in the state at present. Three of these are owned by individual farmers in Nuvem, Navelim and Pernem. The other two belong to Don Bosco Society, Loutolim, and are rented out to farmers.
 
 “We are planning to intensify the progress and achieve at least 1,000 or more hectres under transplanting this Kharif season. We require additional machines. We are thinking of increasing the number of machines either through these companies or through individual farmers,” said director, agriculture, Ulhas Pai Kakode. The modalities of whether the machines would be leased or rented are being worked out.
