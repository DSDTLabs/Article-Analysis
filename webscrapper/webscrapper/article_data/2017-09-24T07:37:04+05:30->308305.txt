CHENNAI: Call it the Rahul effect,   working president   on Saturday admitted the DMK was a family party and there was no second opinion about it. There are several members in the party who are third or fourth generation leaders from their respective families and therefore it was a family party, he said in a letter to the cadres.

 “Several people are accusing DMK of being a family party. There are no qualms about stating that it is a family party. DMK is a family and all new members will be blood vessels of the party and this is the answer to those who accuse us of family rule,” said Stalin. His comments have come close on the heels of   admitting in the US that there was family rule in the  .
 
 Stalin said there had been overwhelming response to the membership drive launched by the party recently. Quoting DMK president   and former chief minister C N Annadurai, Stalin exhorted cadres to participate in the party elections and also work for the party’s growth. “Party cadres must woo more new members by educating them about the party ideology and policies. Fresh blood must flow in the party,” said Stalin.
 
 All steps have been taken to hold the 15 intra-party elections, he said. “We are proud of being members of the DMK. This proudness alone makes us work for the party’s welfare and growth,” he said.
 
 DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan, last week, invited applications from existing members for renewal of membership and from general public for enrolling as new members.
