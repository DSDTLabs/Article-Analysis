PATNA:   ( ) will soon launch a state-wide agitation against the Nitish Kumar government over the issue of corruption in  .

 An announcement to this effect was made by AAP’s Bihar affairs incharge and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh at Patna on Saturday.
 
 Singh, who was in the city to review the party’s organisational structure in the state, told reporters that the AAP would convene a state-level meeting in Patna in March, at which a formal announcement of the agitation would be made.
 
 “Corruption is rampant in Bihar, especially after the Nitish Kumar-led JD (U)’s re-alliance with the BJP. A number of scams have surfaced one after another in the recent months, including Sriajn scam, scholarship scam and toilet scam. “The loot of government funds is a grave issue,” Singh said.
 
 Singh also said the AAP was hopeful of getting justice from the judiciary on the issue of recent disqualification of its 20 legislators in Delhi. 
 
 “There were cases of disqualification of parliamentary secretaries in states like Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Assam and Punjab. Though the respective high courts quashed the appointment of the legislators as parliamentary secretaries, their membership was not terminated. In case of Delhi, however, the legislative membership of AAP parliamentary secretaries was terminated,” the party MP said and added this smacked of double-standards.
 
 Singh described the Budget-2018 presented by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday as “mere lip service”. “It contains ‘Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne’,” he said.
 
 “The Budget shows its makers lacked vision. The much-touted National Health Protection Scheme for health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh each to ten crore families is a false propaganda. The overall estimated cost of the scheme comes to around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, but the Budget has a provision of only Rs 2000 crore for the purpose,” Singh said.
