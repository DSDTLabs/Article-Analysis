HYDERABAD: The Telangana government, which has so far focused on drawing interest in the IT sector in Hyderabad, needs to explore more verticals of tourism in order to fully realize the potential of this booming sector. This was one of the topics in discussion at the International Conference on  , which kicked off at the   at   (UoH) on Tuesday.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, Venkata Ramana, faculty in the School of Management Studies, University of Hyderabad (UoH) and conference director said, “Telangana is blessed with scores of places that can be promoted as   destinations. Australia, for example, has carved out indigenous tourist experiences out of the Aboriginal tribes who are present there. The vast forest cover is also not being properly marketed by the state government in Telangana. The conference thus focuses on emerging marketing strategies in the tourism and hospitality sector.”
 
 The conference, titled ‘Changing Paradigms in Marketing of Services with Special Focus on Tourism and Hospitality’ was inaugurated by Rajiv Sharma, Chief Advisor to Government of Telangana and executive chairman of Centre For Good Governance. Speaking at the conference, Sharma called for ‘quantitative and qualitative’ growth in the tourism and its ancillary services. A ‘systems approach’, now has to be adopted in the tourism sector, he added.
