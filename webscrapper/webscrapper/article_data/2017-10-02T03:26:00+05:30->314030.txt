Mapusa: Deputy speaker of the Goa Assembly and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo has said that Mapusa town has been ignored for almost 20 years with regard to proper development. He was speaking after inaugurating an arms exhibition organized at the Mapusa police station. Lobo was taken around and shown different types of guns such as pistols, rifles, air guns etc which were kept for display at the exhibition. Also present at the exhibition were chairperson of Mapusa municipal council Rohan Kavlekar, councilor Sudhir Kandolkar and others. “Mapusa requires a major revamp. For the last 20 years, it has been bleeding. Roads are broken and repaired again. The same stormwater drains are rebuilt,” he said. “Mapusa is the main headquarters of Bardez and everyone should join hands to bring about much-needed development in the city which has been neglected over all these years,” said Lobo. “We need a good consultant to plan the town and to bring about systematic development. The chairperson should take the lead and appoint a good consultant,” he added. The Calangute MLA further said that chief minister Manohar Parrikar will visit Mapusa on October 3 and spend the entire day to understand the problems of the town. “We have asked the chief minister that the bus stand and the bypass road should be built first, so that Mapusa is de-congested,” he said.
