NEW DELHI: Giving one final chance to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( ) to come clean, the Delhi high court on Wednesday sought names of all its “delinquent officials” who allowed illegal construction in  .

 Hearing a PIL filed by NGO Paardarshita and some individuals alleging illegal construction in Sainik Farms,   made it clear that if there is any further delay, it won’t hesitate to bring in the   to probe the matter.
 
 A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar did not order a   probe after additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for SDMC, assured it that in two weeks the corporation will furnish names of all the officials, including the ‘beldaars’ who were responsible for the illegal activity.
 
 “Just because people of Sainik Farms are rich, why should we differentiate between them and those in Neb Sarai (where CBI is probing unauthorised construction)?” the court asked. “Why should honest people pay a premium for buying land, while people in Sainik Farms get it for a song? Go and penalise them and collect your money,” the court told the civic body.
 
 The bench also asked the Centre why it is “sitting on the scheme” forwarded by the Delhi government for regularising the posh south Delhi colony and asked both the governments to inform the court about the status of the proposal before the next date of hearing on February 22.
