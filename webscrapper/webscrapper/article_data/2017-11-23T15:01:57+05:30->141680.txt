  Get some of her favourite tracks played there and order something exquisite and then ask her out.
 
  
 But remember not to use her real name. You can write what you call her personally.
 
  
 She will surely be moved by your actions. You will definitely get a positive response.

 Take her out in the balcony blindfolded and get her to open her eyes when everything is ready. She will love it.
 
  
 Play some soft music in the car and wisper the golden words to her.

 Get a water gun and let her get shocked for a while and tell her you are under arrest for stealing my heart!
