INDORE: Many areas in the city continue to face   due to the discom’s  . Residential colonies in Satya Sai, Mangal Nagar and Scheme 54 and other areas continue to witness unscheduled power cuts.

 Repairs on electrical equipment are conducted in the mornings but residents say   extend beyond the schedule announced. On Wednesday night, power was suspended for an hour in areas like Satya Sai, Ramkrishnabagh, Dheeraj Nagar, Mahalakshmi, Nanda Nagar.
 
 A resident of Dhiraj Nagar said there was a power cut for around three hours. “The power went off in the afternoon around 1.00pm and came back after 4.00pm. We tried to make a complaint on the discom’s helpline number but no one responded to our calls,” said Shanu Verma.
 
 Meanwhile   officials said though the power cut was not scheduled. “It was due to rain. There was a short circuit in the DP line and it led to fault in jumpers,” said an official with discom. The supply was restored within an hour after it came to our notice, he added.
