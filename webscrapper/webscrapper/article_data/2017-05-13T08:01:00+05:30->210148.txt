GHAZIABAD: A   ran over a brother-sister duo on Friday when the two were busy emptying domestic waste on a railway   near their house in Kadkad Model area of Link Road, Sahibabad. 

 Following the accident, a passerby informed the police. Sudhir (13) and Himanshi (10) were hit by a train that was going from Anand Vihar to   around 7.30am. Their parents are labourers who live just a few metres from the   track.
 
 It was a daily routine for the children to empty   on the railway track, their mother told the police. On Friday too, they had gone to the tracks on their daily errand given by their mother. While Sudhir was a Class IV student, Himanshi studied in Class II in a primary school in Kadkad Model. Their father Ram Mahesh demanded an investigation into the incident.
 
 Rojant Tyagi, SHO, Link Road police station, said, “This was a very tragic incident. We could not even speak to the parents of the kids who were inconsolable. After the postmortem, the bodies were handed over to the family members.” The postmortem report confirmed shock, haemorrhage and antemortem injuries as the medical causes of their death.
 
 Tyagi said, “Any negligence on the part of the train driver in the case is in the realm of conjecture since there is no eyewitness. Also, we cannot arrest anyone since this is not an accident and it could have happened only because of the children’s lack of attention. We cannot file a case against the train driver.”
 
 The death of the two children cast a pall on the entire neighbourhood and triggered concerns about appropriate supervision of the kids in the area.
