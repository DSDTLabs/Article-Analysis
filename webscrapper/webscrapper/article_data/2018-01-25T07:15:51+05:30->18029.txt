AHMEDABAD: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) busted a   in which   like shoes, chocolates, watches,  , cosmetics items, garments, and electronic items weighing around 17 tonnes were attempted to smuggle as courier parcels of   (TR). The goods were smuggled from port of Felixstowe in UK to Inland Container Depot (ICD) Khodiar in Ahmedabad. 

 Officials of the DRI zonal unit, Ahmedabad, said that the goods were imported on the passport of Hazarabibi Abdulaziz Bhamji and a Navsari based person identified as Salim who runs a courier firm. The modus operandi adopted by this smuggling racket was to take the coloured scanned copies of passports of some passengers travelling from England to India by paying them just Rs 5000 to Rs 10,000. Then this smuggling syndicate would book TR consignments in the name of these passengers. In many cases, these passengers were not even aware that TR consignments were being booked and cleared in their names, said DRI officials.
 
 “DRI received an intelligence input that a smuggling syndicate based at London with its accomplices in Navsari was involved in smuggling of courier parcels in the guise of Transfer of Residence consignments. This syndicate sent a 40 feet container containing more than 17 MTs of courier parcels containing assorted items falsely declared as used household goods,” said a DRI official.
