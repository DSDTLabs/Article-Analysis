 The morning started with a session on retro Bollywood fitness for dancer lovers. For fitness enthusiasts, there was not only a zumba session, but a series of sessions, as it was the Battle of Zumba 5.0 in which 10 teams participated. One of the popular songs that the zumba teams performed to was Tamma Tamma Again. Apart from zumba, there was also a surprise for Noidawallahs when members of a dance group started performing in the middle of the crowd just as emcee Maddy was about to announce the winners of the battle. The dancers were then joined by some more performers. Since this Sunday was also Good Deed Day, there was a special performance on nari samman by the members of I – Volunteer group.
