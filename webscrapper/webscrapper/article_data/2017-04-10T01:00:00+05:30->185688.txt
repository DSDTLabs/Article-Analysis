As school-going boys, they could pass off as any other set of kids living in a residential complex. But what sets Sonu Sood’s sons, Eshaan and Ayaan apart is that they are early starters in showbiz. They’ve begun to make short films and subtitle them at home with the help of their gadgets which include sound and computer equipment and software. And they’re not alone. Other children from the building join forces with the Sood boys. They shoot their videos at home or within the building, edit and show them to Sonu. The action began a year or two ago. 

 “One of my friends had asked me if I knew someone who could subtitle videos. My son heard that and asked for the video. Since he’s just a teenager, and was younger then, I didn’t take him seriously. But when I saw his subtitled video, I was stunned because for his age and experience, it was pretty cool. From that day onwards, both my children, along with other kids from the society, have been shooting videos and doing some post-production work on them on their own. They use one of my other flats in the building for that,” says Sonu. 
 When you have a father like that, sky is the limit.
