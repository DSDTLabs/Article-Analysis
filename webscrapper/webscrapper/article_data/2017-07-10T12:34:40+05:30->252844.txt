AMRITSAR: With an aim to protecting 20,000 hectares of forest area in   district, the state government has decided to promote cultivation of  , which will not only provide a source of income to the local population living in hills and forests but will also create a voluntary force of forest guards.

 “Soil of Punjab hills is very fertile for cultivation of various medicinal herbs, so we have decided to promote growing of medicinal plants,” said divisional forest officer, Pathankot range,   while talking to TOI on Sunday. He said that they had raised as many as 74 self-help groups (SHG), which were being provided the required technical knowhow in a phased manner. “We are encouraging cultivation of amla, lemon grass, harar, behra, tulsi, etc.” he added. 
 
 The department was providing them with tin sheds, shredding machines, automatic drying machines, utensils, etc. so a dried product was ready to be marketed to ayurvedic medicines manufacturing units. Work in various hill villages had already begun, he maintained.
 
 Tiwari further said that 90% of SHGs comprised women, who along with their regular household chores, could take up cultivation of medicinal plants to add to their family income. “On an average one person can earn around Rs 100 while doing regular work,” he maintained.
 
 “There are two-pronged benefits of the scheme. First, the poor will get additional source of income and second, they will be voluntarily guarding forest by informing department about encroachers, poachers or those who deliberately set fire to forest areas,” he explained, adding that the initiative would eventually help in not only protecting the forest area but also to expand the forest cover in the state.
 
 He further said that they were also introducing a project regarding manufacturing of cotton bags by the local people and would help them by finding market for their products.
