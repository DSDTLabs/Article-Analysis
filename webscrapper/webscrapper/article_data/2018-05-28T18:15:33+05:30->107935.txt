AHMEDABAD: Out of the five visible  , four are easily seen in the city sky. The streak would continue till mid-June, said experts. 

 While Venus is seen in the west-northwest direction soon after sunset,  , Saturn and   can be seen from 10pm onwards.
 
 Dhananjay  , a city-based science communicator, said that to identify the planets, take help of the Moon. 
 
 “One would be able to see a bright object below the Moon slightly towards the right side. That is Jupiter. Identifying Saturn and Mars would require some expertise but one can take help of mobile applications. Both the planets can be seen at almost equal distance from Jupiter on an imaginary line extending towards eastern horizon. While Saturn looks yellowish, Mars is distinct red to naked eyes,” he said.
 
 Rawal said that before the monsoon, the sky is quite clear and viewing the planets would not be difficult. With powerful binoculars or small telescope, some features of Jupiter and Saturn such as Jupiter’s moons can be seen.
