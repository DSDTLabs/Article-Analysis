Indore: Following suit of Indore, neighbouring cities, Dewas and Ujjain will also set up real time air monitoring stations by April to keep a check on air pollution levels. 

 A team of officials from Bhopal Pollution Control Board will inspect selected locations at both the cities this month, senior officials from Dewas and Ujjain Pollution Control Board said. 
 
 Dewas Pollution Control Board regional officer K N Choudhary said, “We have selected three locations to set up ambient air quality monitoring stations. A team from Bhopal will come for inspection at the sites next week.”
 
 The continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations will display about six air pollution parameters on a real time basis and some of the air pollutants that will be showcased on the screen round the clock will include particulate matter (PM) 10, PM 2.5, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide.
 
 Choudhary said that real time air monitoring stations will help in knowing the levels of air pollution on a real time basis and particularly which levels are high in a particular area. 
 
 With increasing population and vehicular movement, Central Pollution Control Board has issued directives to set up continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations in the area. The stations will be linked online and data can be viewed online on the pollution control board website. 
 
 Ujjain that is being developed as a wedding destination, will install two real time online air pollution monitoring stations at residential and commercial areas. 
 
 A senior official from regional Pollution Control Board, Ujjain said, “The installation work at both the sites will be completed by April.” 
 
 The average yearly PM 10 level remains close to 90 micrograms per cubic metre as against the permissible limit of 60 for industrial, commercial and residential areas.
