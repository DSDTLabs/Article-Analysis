 Skill and talent development are mission-critical priorities for organisations. In India, the government has invested heavily in initiatives such as the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). The private sector, too, has channelised time and money into boosting employee productivity. However, Indian entities are still at a nascent stage of building learning ecosystems, adopting learning technology infrastructure and building accountability for learning.
 
 The disruptions in the learning world
 
 A closer look reveals that the change is happening at three levels. First, corporate   (L&D) is now faced with realities such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, digitisation and Augmented Reality (AR) — words that were alien till a few years ago and have now become common parlance in the learning world. At the second level, employees in general have become hungrier for learning and do not wait for organisations to train and teach them. Just like their shopping preferences, they want their learning to be personalised too. Like their cabs, which arrive just in time, they need just-in-time micro learning too. At the third level, learning has catapulted to become a boardroom discussion. CXOs now realise that one of the big reasons for employee   is the lack of organisational learning opportunities.
 
 All these changes raise a question: Is corporate learning in India equipped to become the talent incubator of organisations? Here are 10 transformations that L&D needs to make to be seen as a function that can drive strategic change:
 
 * Make learning part of the development story: Most organisations have not been able to integrate learning with the larger employee development plan. This is one of the reasons why learning continues to be seen as a stand-alone activity. Effective development is possible when learning interventions are combined with avenues for on-the-job learning, job rotation and job enhancement.
 
 * L&D — from academic to prac-ademic: At the core of learning professionals’ expertise must be a sound understanding of their organisation’s business. Today, most L&D professionals are perceived as being ‘academic’ in their approach, because they lack the business and practical alignment. They need to actively bring in a practitioner view to learning.
 
 * Leadership involvement is great, but it’s not enough: One of the drivers of a sustainable learning culture is leadership involvement in learning. That, however, is not enough. L&D needs to create systemic structures that nurture and have the right rewards and acknowledgment mechanisms. Leadership talk about the importance of learning is only a starting point — it has to be supported through tangible changes on the ground.
 
 * Learning has to evangelise technology: The future of learning lies in the effective usage of technology. Yet, only a small percentage of organisations are using the latest and best technologies in learning. To bring a change, learning professionals have to be tech-savvy. The budgets for technology will come only when learning becomes part of the CEO’s agenda and it gets the required support in terms of budgets. L&D professionals need to engage in strategic conversations that demonstrate the value that learning brings to the business.
 
 * Bring in a coaching culture: Working styles are changing. Employees don’t want managers, but guides and mentors. L&D needs to groom leaders to inculcate a coaching style — one in which they make team members accountable for their growth and learning. This has a trickle-down effect and every employee becomes a coach-leader.
 
 * ‘Design-think’ your learning agenda: Design thinking, with its human-centred approach, draws on creative solutions that hold a very important place in the way learning agenda is created. Learning professionals need to find answers for the future needs of the employees and business, using the principles of prototyping, creativity and empathy.
 
 * L&D needs to become invisible: Agile and invisible! That’s where new-age L&D systems need to be. L&D needs to create the right eco systems, the rich repositories of knowledge and then let the learner take centre stage. The days of the ‘event-centric’, once-in-a-year learning programmes are over. Learning needs to be more ongoing and part of an employee’s work life.
 
 * Recognise the specialist: For impactful learning in the organisation, an elementary requirement is the presence of a learning specialist. L&D professionals need to be experts in their domain. They need to nurture three emotions in their hearts. First, a genuine empathy for the learner’s needs. Second, a close friendship and with the business. And third, love for technology.
 
 * You only need to get them curious: Employees are inherently curious to learn more. Organisation learning then needs to be able to spark that curiosity. It needs to move its focus from being a provider of learning to being a facilitator of learning.
 
 * Beyond the ‘fuzzy logic’: The future of learning is analytics-driven. This is a great opportunity for the learning function — move beyond the mundane metrics of learning hours and participant numbers to a deeper analysis of how learning leads to business and individual growth. L&D’s responsibility is to not only impact change, but also make results measurable and visible.
 
 In summary, L&D needs to move out of its traditional approach of being a provider of learning programmes, L&D professionals need to embrace technology, predict future learner trends and measure learning impact. Finally, they need to fundamentally rethink their roles and become development consultants, who deliver learning that propels organisations and individuals to higher growth.
