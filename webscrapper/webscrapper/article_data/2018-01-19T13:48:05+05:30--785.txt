MUMBAI: In what could be a trailer of bigger things to come, Israeli  , after making a fervent appeal to the Hindi film industry to shoot in his country, whipped out his phone and attempted a history-making moment of putting some of Bollywood’s biggest faces into a selfie with Amitabh Bachchan helming the epic shot. 

 “We believe in India-Israel relationship. One of the most viral pictures occurred at the Oscars a few years ago. I’d like the Bollywood stars to join me for a selfie so a few hundred million Indians and Israelis can see this phenomenal friendship. Jai Hind, Jai Maharashtra, Jai Israel!” he roared as he beckoned the actors and filmmakers at the gathering on Thursday evening titled  . 
 
 For Israel that is now looking for a slice of the Bollywood pie, the PM made every attempt to woo the film community to his land addressing his guests as “Mere pyaare dosto”, threatening to speak for the next few minutes in Hindi and confessing that it wasn’t he who was a big deal when he found out that “Amitabh Bachchan has 30 million more Twitter followers than I do. You guys are the big deal. And that’s because the world loves Bollywood, Israel loves Bollywood, I love Bollywood,” he said. “Following PM Modi’s historic visit, two weeks ago we have passed several resolutions and one of them was films. We put forward a modest sum of 4 million shekels to begin with. We want Bollywood in Israel... If Hollywood sells 1.36 billion tickets, India sells 2.6 billion. That is a confirmation of the strength and presence of the industry.
