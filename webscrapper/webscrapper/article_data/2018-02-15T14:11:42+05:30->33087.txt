Coimbatore: The leopard that mauled a four-year-old boy to death in   was trapped by forest officials in the   north division tea estate on Wednesday. 

 The officials laid traps in the estate where the boy, Saidullah, was killed by the leopard about a week ago. It was caught at 6.00am and was later released into the forest, said an official. 
 
 The death of boy had caused panic among residents of Nadumalai estate. On the day of the incident, the boy’s mother had bathed him at 7.00am and had gone into the house to fetch his clothes. When she came back, the boy was missing. She alerted estate workers, who along with forest officials found the boy’s mutilated body half a kilometre from his house.
 
 Forest officials had spotted leopard’s pug marks in front of the boy’s house and where the body was found, which led them to confirm that the boy had been mauled to death by a leopard. They had set traps in and around the estate to catch the animal.
 
 Forest officials said sighting of wild animals has increased in Valparai over the past few years. Residents and estate workers in Valparai now live in an atmosphere of fear and they abstain from venturing out of their houses after dark, said the official.
 
 To counter this, the forest department has conducted a meeting with estate managers on how to prevent animals from entering into estate premises and settlements. “We also have been taking several precautionary measures to curb human-animal conflicts in the region,” the official added. 
 
 Earlier on Tuesday, a bear had mauled  , 55, from Valparai to death, when he had ventured into the   shola forest for collecting firewood.
