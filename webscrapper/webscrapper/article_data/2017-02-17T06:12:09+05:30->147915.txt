CHENNAI: When   took a vow at the   on Wednesday, yet another dramatic chapter in the ongoing political saga in TN played out on the beach. The Marina, which has been out of bounds for public gatherings or protests, has been the scene of high drama and action in the last few months.

 In the past too, the beach had its own special place in the political history of Tamil Nadu, say historians. “All the major leaders ­ Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Periyar and Karunanidhi -have held meetings on the Marina,“ says Dravidian historian Sangoli Thirunavukkarasu. “In February 1956, an all-party meeting was held on the Marina to discuss the formation of southern states.“
 
 On January 6, 1958, a black flag agitation was held there against Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as part of the anti-Hindi agitation. “During that time, Annadurai and a few others were arrested,“ says Thirunavukkarasu. Every birthday celebration of Annadurai culminated in a rally on the Marina, and on the golden jubilee of his birthday a big rally was organised. The foundation conference of the National Front was held on the Marina in 1989 by Karunanidhi.
 
 The beach featured the Seerani Arangam, a popular venue for public meetings, but it was pulled down in 2003. “A Madras High Court order was issued around 2002-03 to stop public meetings on the Marina,“ says V Balakrishnan, DCP, Mylapore.
 
 The decision by jallikattu protesters seems to have triggered a resurgence of the Marina as the city's political stage. O Panneerselvam chose the Jayalalithaa memorial on the beach to televise his revolt. It was here that he joined hands with Jaya's niece Deepa.Again, on Thursday, Eadappadi Palaniswami, who was sworn in chief minister, came to the Jaya memorial to pay his respects. Not to be left behind, OPS too showed up and took a vow to end family rule in the AIADMK.
