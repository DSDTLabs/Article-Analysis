MYSURU:   and unwilling to move out of their ancestral home, a couple in their 80s is believed to have committed suicide in   on Monday. 

  Rajagopal, 85, and wife, Aparna, 80, were heart patients and had been asked to move to Mysuru with one of their sons.   said the couple consumed pesticide tablets with their dinner on Saturday. Villagers alerted police on finding the couple's bodies at their ancestral house, 15km from the taluk headquarters, close to Kushalnagar in Kodagu. 
 
 Rajagopal, a state government employee, had moved to the village with his wife after retirement. One of their sons lives in Mysuru, while the other is in Bengaluru. Their only daughter is married and settled in Tumakuru. 
 
 Of late,   had not been keeping well and frequent visits to the hospital left them drained. The children had suggested they stop living alone and move to Mysuru for treatment, police said. 
 
 Sources said the children had bought a house in Srirampura II Stage in west Mysuru and were to move in on Wednesday. Their parents, however, did not want to move out of their village home and this may have driven them to suicide, they said. 
 
 Some sources said the ancestral house and field had been sold without the couple's consent and they were distraught when they came to know of it. The sources said the couple's signatures had been taken on the pretext of leasing out the property. Bylakuppe police sub-inspector Shivaramegowda, however, dismissed the claims as rumours and said there was no such complaint. No case has been registered.
