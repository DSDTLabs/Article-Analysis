HUZURABAD: Even as criticism over conditions in the state-run Osmania General Hospital, Gandhi Hospital and Niloufer Hospital is mounting, chief minister   heaped praise on doctors working in government hospitals saying that they are working with utmost dedication and serving the poor. 

 "Mediamen take picures and publish when they find patients lying on the floor in OGH. The doctors at OGH are not turning away the patients though they throng the hospital much more than the hospital can handle. While OGH is a 1,000-bed hospital, the number of patients flocking to the hospital is between 1,800 and 2,200. But all of them are treated. Media should have positive approach on this," Chandrasekhar Rao said.
 
 Speaking at a public meeting in   after launching the Rythu Bandhu scheme, the chief minister said after 'KCR Kits' was introduced wherein if a woman delivers in a state-run hospital, she would get a kit worth 12,000, the deliveries in government hospitals has increased. 
 
 KCR also gave credit to employees working in various departments for the success of government programmes. He said revenue and agriculure departments have worked hard for the completion of land records' updation programme and Rythu Bandhu scheme. "I salute the officers right from chief secretary to village revenue assistant, who have been working hard for the success of schemes," the CM said. Similarly, Transco officials and employees strove hard to make 24-hour power supply a reality in Telangana and irrigation officials worked tirelessly for completion of irrigation projects, he said. 
 
 Interestingly, the chief minister will hold a meeting with the state government employees unions and teachers on May 14 to discuss on their demands. A cabinet sub-committee has already been appointed to look into their issues and the committee will submit its report on Friday.
