NEW DELHI: “If a prayer in Sanskrit is akin to propagating Hindu religion, then is a prayer in English propagating Christianity,” asked a senior official at the ministry of human resource development on Wednesday.

 This was in reaction to a petition in the   claiming that all students of   irrespective of their faith and belief, have to compulsorily recite a prayer based on the Hindu religion at the morning assembly.
 
 Though senior officials of KVS refused to comment on record stating that the matter is subjudice and that it will respond to the SC’s notice, one official on condition of anonymity denied the prayer had any religious connotation.
 
 Priyavrat Chhikara, national general secretary,  , said: “Officially the assembly is of 20 minutes. There is nothing that propagates Hinduism. The prayer is in Hindi which starts with a Sanskrit slokas which is a shanti mantra which means lead me from ignorance to truth; from darkness to light; from death to immortality.”
