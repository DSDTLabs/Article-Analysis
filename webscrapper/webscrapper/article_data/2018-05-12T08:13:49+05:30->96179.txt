PATNA: Police on Friday arrested one Renu Devi (45) from   under Khusrupur police station area in   district on charges of hiring contract killers to eliminate his son,   Ram (26). Mantu’s body was recovered from a ‘taal’ area under   police station on April 7.

 SHO of Bakhtiyarpur police station Deewan Ekram   said the two contract killers –   (35) and Shravan Kumar (32) – were arrested from Teka Bigha village under Bakhtiyarpur police station area on Thursday night. “During interrogation, the criminals revealed that Renu hired them to kill her son. Police are also on the lookout for one Pankaj Paswan alias Lulha (35) in connection with the case,” the SHO added.
 
 He said Renu was upset with her son as he had borrowed money from several people, who were pressuring the family to return the money. “Dharmaveer had initially demanded Rs 50,000 from Renu for killing Mantu, but the contract was finalised at Rs 40,000,” the SHO said. Renu’s younger son works in Delhi. Mantu is survived by his wife and a seven-year-old son. “Police have recovered the pistol used in the murder,” Khan added.
