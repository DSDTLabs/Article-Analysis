Critics and audiences have enjoyed   and Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s chemistry in ' '. In fact, what made the film paisa vasool for their fans are the moments when the two actors come face-to-face and deliver punchlines. When asked what worked so well between the two actors, SRK said, “I give full marks to the fact that we thought of trying to play it like a love-hate relationship. What he does in the end is least expected. There is some badness in him and there is some goodness in me also. Tables turn in the end depends on who’s side you are on. We had more scenes but we had to remove them keeping the length in mind.”
 
  Shah Rukh also spoke about Nawazuddin's unusual style of acting, ”Nawaz is a very humble actor, he doesn’t know what he does and I love actors like that, even I don’t know what I do. I say this because there are some actors who know exactly what they do, Nawaz doesn’t. I used to tell him after a scene, Nawaz bhai woh pehla shot acha tha, let’s do another take, then he will ask me, what did I do in the first one? He knows the character, he knows the scene and he knows the emotion but he doesn’t know what he is doing, which is amazing.”
