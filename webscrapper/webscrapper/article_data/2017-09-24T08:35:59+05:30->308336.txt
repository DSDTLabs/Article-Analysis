LUCKNOW: It was a narrow escape for passengers of Lucknow-Mumbai   train on Friday evening as it ran over a fractured track. A derailment was avoided only because the train was low on speed. Railways has now repaired the track.

 When Pushpak Express passed through Manaknagar railway station on Friday, line men heard an unusual sound and alerted railway officials.
 
 “Our staff alerted us of the fracture after the train passed and we got it immediately repaired,“ said  . Because it was near a station, the train was running at a caution speed of 20kmph. Had the train been running at its normal speed, the fracture could have derailed it.
 
 “We had already planned to replace the track where the fracture was reported. We have replaced the entire `up' line now,“ said Kumar.
 
 He added that it was difficult to say if the fracture existed before the train came or was caused by the train itself.
 
 Over the past few months, several accidents have been caused by derailments across the state.
 
 Tracks in many parts of UP are overused and damaged.
 
 On August 2, a rail break was detected after several trains passed through the Lucknow-Kanpur section in Unnao.
 
 Lucknow division of NR will replace at least 80km of tracks between Lucknow and Kanpur.
 
 “We will do it in phases,“ said the DRM.
