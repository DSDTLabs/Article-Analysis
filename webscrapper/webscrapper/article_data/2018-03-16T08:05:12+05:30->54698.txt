CHANDIGARH:   on Thursday passed a bill advocating death sentence for those convicted of raping girls up to 12 years of age. Haryana will be third state after Rajasthan and   to have such a law.

 The assembly passed the new bill, Criminal Law (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2018 to amend the Indian Penal Code 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. The amendment has made the offence of rape liable to punishment of life-long imprisonment and even death in extreme cases.
 
 For offences of stalking and assault with intent to outrage modesty, the bill has proposed a sentence not less than 2 years and up to 7 years. The Khattar cabinet had approved “harsher punishment” on February 28 after expressing anguish and concern over a series of rapes, especially of minor girls.
 
 The bill was unanimously passed after the INLD and a majority of Congress legislators supported the government’s move. However, some Congress MLAs like Geeta Bhukkal, Kiran Chaudhary and   proposed some changes in the bill. Bhukkal and Chaudhary suggested that the cap of 12 years should be removed as rape is a crime against humanity.
 
 Dalal suggested that only a DSP-rank officer or an IPS officer should be the investigating officer of such offences to ensure accuracy in the investigation and he wanted a committee to be set up to decide on the changes needed in the amendment.
 
 Replying to the debate, chief minister   said the bill would be passed in its present form, but he later would consider setting up a committee to give suggestions on the issue and if needed, would make more amendments or even introduce an ordinance.
