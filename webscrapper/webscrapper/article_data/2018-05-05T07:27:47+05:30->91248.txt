HYDERABAD: A video showing a   corporator engaging the services of a child to clear a waterlogged stretch in Hayathnagar, a day after heavy rains lashed the city, drew severe criticism from activists. In the video, S Tirumala Reddy (corporator,   division) is seen removing plastic and other garbage stuck in the manholes along the stretch, while the 11-year-old boy is spotted next to him holding a plastic box that the corporator is throwing the waste into. 

 The water-level, as per the video, is almost up to the waist of the child.
 
 Condemning the act of the public representative, activists said that it amounted to child labour. "Being a corporator, he cannot allow a child to get into such a dangerous situation. It could have resulted in an accident. He should be booked under   prohibition act" said Achyuta Rao, president of Balala Hakkula Sangham, a child rights body.
 
 Last month, Tirumala Reddy was in the news for blocking a part of the road and dancing to blaring music along with other GHMC staffers and his cadre.
