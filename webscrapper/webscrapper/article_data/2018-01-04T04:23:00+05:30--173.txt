Vadodara: With assembly  , the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has resumed its razing drive in the city. The civic body razed over 170 structures in the Lalbaug area of the city on Wednesday.

 The civic body had constructed a flyover on the stretch, but had not removed encroachments on the side of the flyover. Dwellings and shops were major hindrances in traffic flow below the flyover. These were issued notices recently by the civic body and were asked to vacate.
 
 Those possessing these properties had made representations to the civic body asking it to give them houses in the Manjalpur area itself. But the civic body is not in a position to consider the demand as it has no housing scheme for the urban poor in Manjalpur.
 
 Apart from the issue of encroachments, it had also come to light that some of the structures were on the Masiya storm water drain. The drain is the major source of removal of rain water from the southern parts of the city. The civic body has spruced it up in the past, but the stretch near Lalabaug bridge was ridden with encroachments.
 
 VMC teams conducted razing drives at Vansfodia Vasahat as well as Bhathujinagar in the area to raze 140 dwellings. The residents here were given logistical support to vacate their dwellings. They will be given residences elsewhere.
 
 The teams also razed 32 shops that were earlier on the main road, but came on the service road after the flyover was constructed. With the removal of encroachments, the congestion that was witnessed on the service road will also be taken care of.
