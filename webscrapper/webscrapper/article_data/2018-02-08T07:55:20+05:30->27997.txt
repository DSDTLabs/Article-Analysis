CHENNAI: The proposed call for a   by the   to express displeasure over the high fee charged by   for screening films in theatres continues to hang in the balance. An attempt to resolve the issue through discussions turned futile on Wednesday as talks between representatives of the film industry and digital companies in Hyderabad remained inconclusive.

 Both sides have agreed to meet again on February 16 in Chennai for another attempt at resolving the issue. While the crisis threatens to become bigger if not resolved at the earliest, the extreme demands of the film industry do not seem to be helping in finding a solution, a source in the film industry said.
 
 “The representatives from the film industry — producers, distributors and exhibitors — from the five southern states met the top officials of digital service providers on Wednesday. The meeting held in Hyderabad ended without any sign of a solution. We highlighted our concerns and they also realized how serious we are on this issue. We will again meet on February 16 to find a solution,”   and vice-president of Tamil Film Producers’ Council (TFPC) S R Prabhu said.
 
  (SIFCC) has been trying to bring out an amicable solution to the issue. “We are trying for a compromise and the representatives have agreed to meet again next Friday. However, there are certain extreme demands from the film industry and that is making the task much more difficult,” a SIFCC office bearer told TOI.
 
 According to the official, the Telugu industry has been demanding complete waiver of charges for digital screening of films. This looks next to impossible. The digital projection companies have offered a 10% reduction on present charges. “While the digital companies have not increased their charges over the last 10 years, during which time the value of the US Dollar had doubled against Indian Rupee. These companies import most of the equipment from the US,” SIFCC official pointed out.
