NAGPUR: In a massive protest, around 2,000 members of the women’s self-help groups marched to the tehsil office at Kalmeshwar on Friday to complain against arm-twisting actions by private   (MFCs).

 The protest march was led by Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti’s Ram Nevle and Arun Kedar. The agitation marked the opening of the Kalmeshwar taluka unit of the samiti.
 
 Addressing the   workers, Nevle said that big industrialists and business tycoons like   were left scot-free even as bad loans of nationalized banks swelled to over Rs6 lakh crore. On the other hand, women SHGs who sweat it out to make measly incomes were being harassed by the micro-finance companies which were charging usurious rates and using strong arm tactics and threats to effect recoveries.
 
 Kedar asked the SHG members to stop repayment to the micro-finance companies which were not doing proper documentation of loan accounts and using illegal ways to operate in the region. “The MFCs are not following the set rules and so the loans they are offering are illegal in nature. They do give a receipt for payments. These companies deploy goons to threaten the hapless women SHG members who have taken loans. So, stop your repayments and do not get cowed down by threats,” said Kedar.
 
 The members submitted individual forms giving all loan details to the tehsildar asking him to forward it to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.
