CHENNAI: Seattle-based Columbia Pacific, owner of Columbia Asia Hospital Group, one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare providers in Asia, has acquired Serene Senior Care, a leading player in the housing segment for senior citizens in the country, for an undisclosed sum.

 With this, Columbia Pacific said it will significantly expand its senior housing portfolio over the next five years. Serene Senior Care currently operates 735 residential units in four senior housing communities in South India, with a presence in Chennai, Puducherry and Coimbatore. Serene plans to expand to 1700 units under Columbia Pacific by fall 2017.
 
 To begin with, the first two senior housing communities that Columbia Pacific will build are being planned in Bangalore. Within five years, Columbia Pacific is planning to more than quintuple the number of the units Serene Senior Care has under management to 5000 units. 
 
 “With the decades of experience and expertise of Columbia Pacific, we are well positioned to provide India’s senior population with communities built to the highest international standards,” said P Viswanathan, managing director, Serene Senior Care.
 
 Columbia Pacific, a family of private asset and investment management companies, also owns and operates hospitals and senior care facilities across Asia, including the Columbia Asia hospital company in India and Southeast Asia.
