LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Beleaguered Pakistan PM   has met his top ministers and aides to discuss options before the government to defuse a simmering civil-military row over a leaked report that had angered the powerful army, according to media reports on Monday. 

 The meeting in Lahore on Sunday followed Pakistan’s military rejecting Sharif’s move to sack his top aide and special assistant on foreign affairs Tariq Fatemi. The military had demanded full implementation of recommendations by a committee which probed a story in the Dawn newspaper last October of a meeting at which civilian leaders confronted the military over its alleged reluctance to halt Islamist groups in the country. The meeting was held at PM Sharif ’s office on October 3, 2016, days after India carried out a surgical strike in PoK on September 29 to destroy terror launch pads across the Line of Control. 
 
 The Sharif government is considering to either formally withdraw the contentious notification or to unofficially discard it and issue a separate 'comprehensive' notification through the interior ministry, the Express Tribune quoted sources as saying. Finance minister Ishaq Dar, interior minister Chaudhry Nisar, principal secretary to the Prime Minister Fawad Hassan Fawad — whose signature was on the notification in question — and Punjab CM Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz were part of the low-key consultative huddle in Lahore, the report said. 
 
 Ruling party sources close to Nawaz said Nisar was unhappy with the issuance of the notification by the Prime Minister’s office. They said the interior minister, who was directly dealing with the Dawn leaks issue, felt he was 'bypassed' by Sharif’s secretary to issue the notification. 
 
 Sharif ’s aides told Nisar that the security establishment’s disappointment over the notification stemmed mainly from the fact that it was issued by Fawad, whose own role is being questioned in the Dawn leaks episode, the report said.
