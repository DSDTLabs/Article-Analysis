LUDHIANA: Though mobile cab booking services have made life and commuting much easier for common people, a city-based trader was left shocked when he came to know that the taxi used by his wife, booked through a mobile application, was not registered with the company. This fact came to light when his wife forgot her mobile in the taxi, and they approached the cab company officials, where they were told that the driver’s number provided by them was not registered under their company. Following this, the trader filed a complaint with police commissioner   on Saturday.

 Vinay Gupta, a businessman from   of  , said that on Friday his wife had booked a taxi for home through a mobile application. After she reached home, she realized she had left her mobile inside the taxi. Later, when they called back the contact number from which they had received the driver’s call, the calls were left unanswered. Following this, they wrote to the company through e-mail, but did not receive any reply.
 
 “Today, we reached the office of the cab service in  , where we were told that the number, from which we received a call from the driver was not registered with them. We were shocked, as the driver called us through a mobile booking. Further, the official also told us that our number too was not registered with them, though we had booked the cab several times,” said Gupta.
 
 He added: “This is highly unsafe, as so many times, our children use the cab even at late hours. Either there is no authenticity and reliability of such services, or there is some fraud going on. Moreover, the official said the numbers the driver used were dummy numbers, on which only outgoing calls were allowed. Considering the seriousness of the matter, I filed a complaint with police commissioner RN   today through e-mail.” Dhoke said the police would verify the matter.
