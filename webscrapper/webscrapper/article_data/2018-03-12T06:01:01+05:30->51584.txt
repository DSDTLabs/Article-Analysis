HYDERABAD:   chief minister   plans to emulate the 2014   avatar in the run-up to the 2019 parliamentary elections and catapult himself as a national leader. As Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi toured the country five years ago and powered the BJP to power at the Centre. 

 Infusing confidence among legislators that he won't quit state politics till 2019 elections, sources said,   cited Modi's feat in 2014 to achieve twin objectives of retaining power in the state and cobbling up a potent non-BJP/Congress front at the Centre.
 
 Stating he would sit on a dharna in Delhi and tour the country to meet leaders across the political spectrum, KCR told party MLAs that his focus would remain on Telangana politics till 2019.
 
 He warned party legislators against indulging in corruption and exercising caution while speaking on cell phones. "The Centre has at its disposal agencies like CBI and Enforcement Directorate which can be unleashed on you," KCR told MLAs.
