HYDERABAD: At a time when the   is encouraging digital transactions, several business establishments in the city, including eateries, are still found accepting card payments, only selectively. According to consumers, most stores are either charging an added amount for online payments of swiping cards if the bill value is above ₹300.

 “I visited a restaurant in RTC crossroads and was charged two per cent extra for using my card. The management claimed that the extra money goes to the bank,” said Santosh Kumar, a software engineer.
 
  
 Decrying this practice, senior bankers maintained that this additional charge was illegal. “According to RBI norms, the additional charge should be borne by the merchant and not the consumer,” said one of them.
 
 Several people also complained of establishments charging more if they pay via Paytm. “People don’t consider Paytm as currency in many places. When I visited a store in MPM Mall, Abids, they refused to accept Paytm money and insisted that I pay by cash,” said Sumalatha R a techie. The consumer even claimed how shopkeepers in several stores lose interest in entertaining guests who wish to pay via Paytm.
 
 Registering a similar complaint about an eatery in  , another customer said how traders always apprehensive about accepting online payments. “The vendor used to charge me more for paying via Paytm. And now that I visit the shop more frequently, he allows me credit and asks me to come back with cash the next day, to help save on that charge. He is still closed to the idea of Paytm money,” said Madhu Kiran Battula a local.
