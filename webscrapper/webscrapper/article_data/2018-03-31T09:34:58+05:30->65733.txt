CHENNAI: Purchasing fresh vegetables at the best price involves wading through a   with the stink of rotten greens as an accompaniment for R Shankar, a resident of Nerkundram, who visits the   twice a week.

 
 Hygiene and cleanliness seem to have been sacrificed for a good bargain at the 125 acre acre property. “The stink is unbearable. People walk over vegetable waste strewn along the pathway at the market causing an unpleasant experience for shoppers,” said Shankar.
 
 
 The piling up of trash has been a longstanding woe for visitors to the market comprising about 2,750 shops selling flower, fruits and vegetables, generating nearly 200 tonnes of garbage daily. Though an area has been earmarked behind every shop for disposing of waste, traders prefer to leave it on the pathways.   are dumped on the premises, which attracts cattle in the locality.
 
 
 S Chandran, president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association admitted traders were yet to practise proper disposal of waste but also raised concerns about clearing of garbage. “We have asked traders not to spill trash on the pathways. The traders say garbage collection does not happen from the space earmarked for the purpose,” he said. The Market   (MMC), comprising officials from the CMDA and representatives of traders, maintains that garbage clearance is being conducted by a private agency.
 
 
 V R Soundararajan, former member of MMC and president of Koyembedu   Association, said the CMDA must allow the corporation to take over the responsibility of maintaining the facility. “Of late, garbage is being cleared twice a day at flower, fruit and vegetable markets,” said an MMC official, adding that steps are being taken to prevent cattle from entering the market
