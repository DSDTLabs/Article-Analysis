Panaji: The three week-long monsoon session of the Goa assembly — the longest session since the Manohar Parrikar-led coalition government was formed —begins on Tuesday.  Issues such as offshore casinos, desecration of religious structures, regional plan, CST, medium of instructions (MoI) top the agenda of the opposition. This will be the first long session wherein some of the main opposition members of the previous term are now in the ruling.  Pramod Sawant, speaker of the Goa assembly, told mediapersons on Monday that they have received 1,720 questions— 637 starred and 1,083 un-starred—which will be taken up for discussion during 15 sittings of the assembly. “As much as 80% of the questions were received online and 20% in written form,” Sawant said, adding that the response by legislators to the initiative to go paperless has been fantastic. The main business before the House is passing of the state budget 2017-18. The session is expected to discuss important bills, including amendment bills, the Goa Preservation of Tress (Amendment) Act, and Goa Agricultural Tenancy (amendment) Act. The BJP had assured its coalition partner, Goa Forward Party that the government would re-designate status of the coconut tree even as the previous BJP-led government which brought in the controversial amendment bill, had not given in to the opposition demand despite facing severe criticism from all quarters. The second important amendment bill pertains to Agriculture Tenancy Act to revert disputed tenancy cases to the mamlatdars.
