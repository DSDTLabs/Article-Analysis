MUMBAI: A home-maker from   became the victim of credit card   when Rs 1 lakh was transferred from her account to e-wallet accounts in Delhi and Noida on June 9. Thirty-five transactions were carried out in 35 minutes using Mrinali Jayakar’s card after the fraudsters changed her registered mobile number with a nationalized   so that she does not receive transaction alerts.

 A case was registered with Santacruz police on June 16, when the victim’s husband, Ajit, went through the card’s e-statement and noticed the fraudulent transactions. The bank said it will take at least 60 days to decide if the money could be reversed.
 
 Ajit suspects a bank employee parted with confidential information about the account. He said the fraudster knew she never used the   for a year. “On June 9, she received a call from Gaurav Bharadwaj, who claimed to be a bank executive. He asked her why she was not using the card, and if she would like to redeem Rs10,000 reward points that had accrued,” Ajit told TOI.
 
 Mrinali trusted the caller after he read out confidential details of her account. “She first told him to update the postal address from Pune to Mumbai so that she could redeem the points. The caller told her to tell him the one-time password (OTP) received on her registered mobile. He also said the changes would be reflected within 72 hours. When there was no update, I checked online and found the fraudulent transactions. Later, I learnt he used the   to change my wife’s registered mobile number with the bank, which he used in the transactions,” he said.
 
 Ajit first approached the cyber police station at Bandra-Kurla Complex, which told him to complain to the bank and e-wallet office. Later, the cyber police acknowledged the written complaint and told him to complain to the local police station. A case was filed under the Indian Penal Code section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and under the IT Act 66 (C) (identity theft) against Bharadwaj.
 
 He said 35 transactions ranging from Rs2,000-3,000 were carried out to transfer the money to various e-wallet accounts. “A probe is on, we have sought details from the bank. We are also going through call data records of the fraudster’s number,” said Santacruz police senior inspector Shantanu Pawar.
 
 Cyber advocate Vicky Shah said with the advent of social networking and technology, fraudsters have found innovative new ways of committing fraud. “Banks which are beneficiaries in the transactions sometimes do not cooperate or give information on time. Thus, law-enforcement agencies are helpless,” said Shah.
