KOLKATA: Pt   will be conferred with the   award this year. The 88-year-old veteran vocalist from the Agra gharana got a call on Thursday afternoon informing him about his award in the art-music category.

 From West Bengal, the other recipients of the Padma Shri include   in social work, Amitava Roy in science and engineering,   in literature and education and Sudhanshu Biswas in social work. There are no recipients of the Padma Vibhushan and   awards from this state. Speaking to TOI, Kichlu said, “I wish the   government had sent more recommendations for bestowing the Padma awards to deserving candidates from this state.”
 
 About his own award, Kichlu isn’t entirely happy. “Yes, there is some recognition of the contribution that I have made. But it’s too little, too late. I retired from ITC Sangeet Research Academy in 2001. It’s taken the government more than 15 years post my retirement to recognize my contribution,” he said.
 
 On being asked if he felt he was more deserving of the Padma Vibhushan, Kichlu said, “That would have been too ambitious.”
 
 With many junior artistes having got a Padma Shri much before him, the buzz is that bestowing him with a Padma Bhushan would have been a better idea. Kichlu too agreed saying that it would have done justice to his “seniority” and “dedication” to Indian classical music.
