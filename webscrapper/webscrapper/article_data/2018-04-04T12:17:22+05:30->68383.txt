GUNTUR: In an attempt to encourage organic cultivation, state-level agriculture market yard chairpersons committee resolved to set up dedicated platforms to manage organic produce transactions in the yards itself. Separate auction platforms will be constructed in all the yards.

 A decision was taken at the committee meeting held here at the agriculture market yard on Tuesday. State committee president and Guntur agriculture market committee chairman   presided over the session. Speaking at the meeting, Subbarao urged the state to grant at least 20 acres to each agriculture market yard in the state in order to take up the organic cultivation on an experimental basis.
 
 He said the market yards were getting into the organic produce business and this would encourage farmers of neighbouring areas to learn the skills and switch to the new mode. He said it would be easy for the market yards to take up organic cultivation since it would be easy for them to rope in the agriculture and marketing department staff to extend support. “The respective market committees can encourage the local progressive farmers to take up the cultivation in the land attached to the yard and promote the organic agriculture practice,” said Subbarao.
 
 He urged the state government to allow all the market committees to spend at least 20 per cent of their funds on construction of link roads in the villages as they play a vital role in bringing the agriculture produce to the market yards. Later, the state-level market yards chairpersons committee also demanded that the management of raithu bazaars be handed over to the market committees. The committee general secretary I Siva Reddy said the government should take up seed distribution activities through the market committees. Ch Srinivasa Rao, Ch Suresh Raju, B Ramakrishna, M Venkateswarlu, T Nageswara Rao and B Ramireddy were present.
