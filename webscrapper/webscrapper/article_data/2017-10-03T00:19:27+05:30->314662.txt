Coimbatore: A group of regular customers to the   in   village near   have sought   from ‘abusive’ anti-liquor protesters. They submitted a petition to superintendent of   Pa Moorthy demanding protection to drink at the Tasmac outlet that was opened in the neighbourhood recently. 

 Some of the local residents had requested them to join the protest against the Tasmac outlet, the petitioners from AT Colony in Sengathurai, who turned up at the district police office to submit the petition, said. “Tasmac authorities recently opened a liquor outlet at a coconut farm in Sengathurai. On Saturday, some local residents issued notices to protest against the outlet. Since we wanted the authorities to open the liquor outlet, we did not participate in the protest on Sunday. Subsequently, some of the protesters approached us and abused us using very bad words for not participating in the protest. They have threatened us against visiting the shop in future,” Prakash, a resident of Sengathurai village, said.
 
 “We want the outlet to function in our village. Police should give protection for the regular customers,” Prakash added.
 
 The petitioners said that they were earlier forced to travel at least 10 kilometres from the village to buy liquor. “We used to travel on motorcycles to buy liquor. It was too risky to return home drunk. So, we were very happy after the outlet was opened in our village. Though anti-Tasmac protesters want the shop to be closed, we will fight to retain it in our village,” another petitioner told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, the revenue department has decided to conduct a meeting with anti-Tasmac protestors and Tasmac authorities at Sulur taluk office on Tuesday.
