Coimbatore: After protesting for nearly 10 days, the members of the Joint Action Committee of Teachers’ Organisation (Jacto) and government employees organisation (GEO) withdrew their protest against the State government on Friday. 

 The protest was abandoned after the Madurai bench of Madras high court assured to hold talks with the government.
 
 The high court has summoned the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu government, Girija Vaidyanathan, on September 21 to provide the government’s view on the demands of JACTO-GEO. “We expect that the State government will agree to our demands,” said a member of the high-level committee of JACTO-GEO, M Rajashekaran. 
 
 The organisations have been demanding a 20% interim compensation from the State government for failing to implement the seventh pay commission. They also demanded withdrawal of the existing pension scheme that was implemented in 2003 and is applicable to all State government employees who joined service after 2003. 
 
 “If the government does not agrees to look into our demands, the high-level committee of JACTO-GEO will decide the further course of action,” Rajashekaran said.
