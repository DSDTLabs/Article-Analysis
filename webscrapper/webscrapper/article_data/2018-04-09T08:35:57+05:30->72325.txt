MYSURU:   of the city have lauded the efforts of   for setting up a   at the SR Subbarao Park.

 The park which covers an area of about one acre is a prominent lung space for the residents of the locality.
 
 Though the building for the library was constructed a year ago, it has opened its doors for reading activities only recently.
 
 Shridhar Murthy, a resident of the locality, said Subbarao Park is a serene and calm place to take a stroll every morning. “With the library facility coming up here, we can sit back and relax while reading books. The library would surely be my favourite place in the park,” he said.
 
 Local corporator J S Jagadeesh told TOI that the localities of Sharadadevi Nagar, Nivedita Nagar and surrounding areas were in need of a library. “Since there was dearth of space to construct a library, we chose to set it up at the SR Subbarao Park which falls under MCC and was feasible for us. Built at a cost of Rs 15 lakh, the library now has newspapers, magazines and basic books for readers. In the coming days, we have plans to extend the facility further,” he said.
 
 “As of now, the library is open to visitors in the morning from 8am to 11am and from 4pm to 9pm in the evenings. There are plans to keep it open throughout the day, but due to model code of conduct, we are not able to make further modifications,” Jagadeesh added.
 
 Deputy director of city central library B Manjunath told TOI that the library building was transferred from the MCC to the department of libraries two months ago. “We have appointed staff from the   on temporary basis. In the coming days, a full-time staff will be deployed. With the increase in the number of readers, membership cards will also be extended to them,” he added.
