MARGAO: Town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai on Thursday assured a delegation of 100-odd private tourist taxi operators that the state government would safeguard the interests of Goan taxi operators and would ensure that app-based radio taxi services, such as   and Uber, don’t ruin their business. 

 He, however, cautioned that they should be prepared to justify their position in the event of an online petition to commence Ola and Uber services in the state being converted into a writ petition before the court, which “is now deciding everything through its judicial overreach, and running the government”.
 
 The delegation, led by Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao, met Sardesai at the   collectorate in connection with the same online petition. 
 
 Sardesai, who is also the MLA of Fatorda, further sought to know what assurance private taxi operators would provide the court in terms of accepting and adopting new technologies in their business. “Create a Goan taxi model and provide figures (fare charts), because the overall impression is that tourists are being swindled by cab operators in Goa,” he told the delegation.
 
 Agreeing that Goa required more high-end tourists, the TCP minister warned that local cab operators would lose sympathy if they continued to object to the implementation of digital meters in their cabs. 
 
 The Fatorda MLA admitted that the state government needed to have a clear and firm stand on the issue, which he said would be deliberated during a meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
