MUMBAI: CM   said while the   was victorious in Palghar, it was unfortunate the election had witnessed a bitter battle between two saffron allies in government. Addressing a press meet on Thursday, Fadnavis said the   putting up the son of   against BJP could have been avoided. 

 "For us the bitterness has ended with the elections.   and his family are always welcome in the BJP. To ensure this does not happen in future, it is necessary to introspect if elections should be fought in such a manner. It will be discussed at a larger forum," he said. The CM also said the EC must take a serious view of malfunctioning of EVMs. The non-functioning does not mean the machines are rigged, he said, adding BJP was hardest hit by the EVM failure. 
 
 Fadnavis said BJP has always been in favour of an alliance with Sena but it cannot be one way, adding both parties need to analyse why such a situation had arisen. "We have always respected Sena. We consider Balasaheb Thackeray the architect of our alliance. It is my frank opinion that this breaking of alliance is not benefitting the Sena, instead it is harming them." He added, "It is in the interest of the parties to fight together. But if the situation arises, we will go it alone like we did in Palghar."
 
 Calling the opposition alliance "unholy," he said Sena and BJP are natural allies. On the loss in Gondia, Fadnavis said the region has been facing a severe drought and this had created anti-incumbency. "Had elections been held post-monsoon, BJP would have won," he said. The CM said aid for the drought-hit could not be provided during poll period as the EC would not allow it. "But given the drought, there is bound to be resentment against the state," he said.
