BAREILLY: Dozens of   and   holders on Monday held a protest at the collectorate here alleging that around 4,000   in Bareilly were running without  
 
  Under the aegis of Great Pharmacist Welfare Society, the pharmacists met district magistrate   and submitted a memorandum in this regard.
  
  “In its order of December 12, 1997, the Supreme Court has said that any sale or purchase of medicines can be done only by a pharmacist and it would be a punishable offence if a person or a firm is found to be involved in trading drugs without going through a pharmacist. Following the SC’s order, the Uttar Pradesh drug controllers instructed all the food and drug safety officials and food inspectors across the state in June ,1999 to execute the order strictly in their respective jurisdiction but there is no adherence of the order so far,” Dr Rajaram Gangwar, district president of the association said.
  
  Deputy president of the association Dr Pradeep Gautam said there are around 5,000 medical stores in the district of which 1,500 are registered with FSDA and only 100 of them have pharmacists.
  
  The DM assured the agitated pharmacists that appropriate action will be taken in the matter. She also instructed FSDA officials to make a list of medical stores running without pharmacists.
