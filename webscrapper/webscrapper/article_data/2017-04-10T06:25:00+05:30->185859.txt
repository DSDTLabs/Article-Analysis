 The residents living in the slums that have come up alongside the national highway over a period of past two-and-a-half decades were already grappling with inadequate supply of water due to the depletion in the groundwater table. To add to their woes, the electric motor of the pumping station of Kumrum slum became defunct, suspending   to as many as 5,000 households. 
 
 According to the drinking water and sanitation department (DWSD) one out of the three electric motors was defunct for the past several days and the second motor went out of order on Saturday. DWSD officials water supply to the slum has been suspended temporarily as the third motor cannot withstand excess load. 
 
 “There are 3,000 legal connections and about 2,000 illegal connections that will be affected by the water suspension,” said DWSD executive engineer Mantosh Mani. He added that work is ongoing to restore water supply in seven to 10 days.
 
 The DWSD officials have informed that senior officials of the department are in regular touch with the Jamshedpur circle of the state electricity board to improve electricity supply. 
 
 “Erratic supply of power is the prime reason behind abrupt load on the motor that eventually affects its functioning,” added a field official of the water department. 
 
 He said water tankers will make the rounds in affected areas till such time water supply is resumed. 
 
 In the wake of growing reports of unavailability of water in several areas that fall outside the command area of Tata Steel, the district administration has introduced mobile water tanker service to lessen the water problems of the people. 
 
 According to an officials, 26 mobile water tankers will ferry water to the affected areas every day. He said people can approach the administration round-the-clock for availing tanker service.
