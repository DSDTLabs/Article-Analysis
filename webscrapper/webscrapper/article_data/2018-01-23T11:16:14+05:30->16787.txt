CHENNAI: At a time when AIADMK ministers have been trying to distance themselves from being under the shadow of the  , senior party leader and   member   on Monday praised Prime Minister   for addressing a wide range of issues concerning the nation during his interview with Times Now. 

 At the same time, Maitreyan wished that the PM had made references to specific issues concerning south India. 
 
 The three-time MP also urged   to offer his personal attention on issues relating to Tamil Nadu.
 
 Maitreyan said in his Facebook post, "As for Tamil Nadu, even though the BJP has no significant presence in the state, the people of Tamil Nadu, cutting across party lines, had great expectations from Narendra Modi when he assumed office in 2014."
 
 "Of late, on various issues concerning Tamil Nadu - be it setting up of Cauvery Management Board or NEET or methane gas or fishermen issue or setting up of AIIMS in TN - there is a growing resentment against the Centre. It is necessary that the Prime Minister shows his personal attention and assures the people of the state that he is on the same page with them," Maitreyan said in the post.
 
 "I have only offered constructive criticism. While outlining the huge expectation of the people of this country, I have also drawn his attention to the problems faced by Tamil Nadu from the perspective of a common man. Beyond that there is nothing," Maitreyan told TOI.
 
 In his Facebook post, Maitreyan further said, "I had gone on record at that time that with a massive mandate if Modi cannot deliver, no one can. Three and half years down the line, the country is on the right track. There may be slow progress in some areas, but on the whole, the country is moving forward."
