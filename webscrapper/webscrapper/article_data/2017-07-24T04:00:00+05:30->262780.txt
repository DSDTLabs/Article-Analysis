Surat: The Ukai dam over Tapi river recorded an inflow of 150 million cubic metre (MCM) of water in the past 48 hours, a first for this monsoon season. The water level of the dam rose to 309.3 feet from 306 feet two days ago.

 The catchment area of Ukai reservoir, which is located 100km from Surat city, lies in the upper and lower basins of Tapi river in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Most of the water in the reservoir flows into it after August 15.
 
 Hathnur dam, located in the upper catchment area of Tapi river, releases water once its level reaches 208 metre. Water from Hathnur crosses three barrages at Sulwade, Sarankheda and Prakasha in Maharashtra before reaching Ukai. 
 
 “There are a number of irrigation schemes attached to these three barrages. Water is released from these barrages once its touches a particular level there. This is why water starts flowing into Ukai dam in huge quantity after August 15. A good spell of heavy rainfall in the basins of Tapi would fill up Ukai dam to 80% of its capacity which is 335-foot mark,” said A M Patel, superintending engineer, Ukai dam. 
 
 “We expect the water level at Ukai to touch 315-foot mark by August 15. Another 2,000 MCM of water by August-end would be good enough to meet the requirement of a few districts in south Gujarat, including Surat. Ukai dam was receiving water at the rate of 6,000 cusecs on Sunday evening,” Patel said.
