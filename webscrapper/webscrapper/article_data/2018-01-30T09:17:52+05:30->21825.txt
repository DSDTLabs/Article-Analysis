GUWAHATI: Union Home Minister   on Monday assured Assam Chief Minister   that state's territorial integrity will not be compromised when the final Naga peace accord is signed.

 Singh's assurance came in the wake of violence in   district of Assam last week that left two persons dead while protesting over the demand for a "Greater Nagalim" and reported move to include parts of the district in the proposed Nagalim.
 
 "The Union Home Minister assured that the territorial integrity of Assam will be fully protected. There should be no apprehension in anyone's mind," Sonowal said while calling upon the people of the state to maintain peace and harmony.
 
 Sonowal has also invited various organisations of the Dima Hasao district for a meeting in a bid to diffuse tension and also to inform them in unequivocal terms about the state and the Centre's stand on the issue.
