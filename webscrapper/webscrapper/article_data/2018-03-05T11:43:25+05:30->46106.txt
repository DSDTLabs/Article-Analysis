NASHIK: The inauguration of the much-awaited funicular trolley at the ancient Saptashrungi shrine has to wait a little more as a few small but important corrective steps suggested by National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) experts need to be implemented. 

 After inspecting the trolley on February 28, NDRF experts submitted a report to a private firm on March 1 where they suggested to make the uphill waiting arena durable enough to carry 120 plus individuals.

Moreover, the NDRF has suggested adding a step near the entrance gate of the trolley to avoid devotees specially children or elderly persons from falling,” said a senior engineer of the company who is overseeing the work. 
 
 Meanwhile, test rides of the funicular trolley are being conducted on a daily basis. Officials said they are waiting for the final nod to the commercial operations. 
 
 PWD officials of Kalwan circle said 98% of the work is done. “The NDRF suggestions will be implemented soon and the trolley can be open to the public at any point of time. However, the final decision will be taken by the district administration and the state government,” said a senior PWD official. 
 
 “This is a first-of-its- kind trolley in   and will be the pride of the state. So, we expect Chief Minister   to inaugurate the trolley. We are also searching for the auspicious muhurat to start commercial operations,” said senior temple trustee  . 
 
 The trolley is may be inaugurated on or before March 18 on the occasion of   or Marathi New Year. The auspicious ‘Chaitra Navaratri’ also begins on this day. A number of devotees visit the temple during Navaratra. So, the trustees want to begin the commercial operations by Gudi Padva.
