LUCKNOW: The   government at its second cabinet meeting on Tuesday is likely approve the proposed plan for 24-hour power supply through an agreement with the Centre. Highly placed source told TOI that the state cabinet may gives its nod to the draft of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to be signed between UP government and the Centre.

 The MoU is likely to be signed in Lucknow in the presence of chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi on April 14. The BJP in its election manifesto had promised 24-hour power supply in the state by 2018. The MoU between UP and the Centre which was expedited due to a keen interest shown by the CM would be a major step towards fulfilling this promise, says a senior official of power department.

 Similarly, the cabinet may also approve major decision in the mining policy to provide cheaper house construction material related to the public. “The CM has been very particular about the mining department and in order to check rampant corruption in the department, he has kept the portfolio with himself. Now, he wants to introduce drastic changes in the mining policy to plug the loopholes,” says a source.
 
 The chief minister had constituted two ministerial sub groups to submit their reports on mining and another was on the potato production and purchase. The ministerial sub group’s report on potato purchase may also be tabled before the cabinet for its consideration.
 
 The CM also wants to make cheap meals available to the poor people in the state and a plan is being formulated in this direction. At its Tuesday’s meeting, the cabinet might take up this plan as well.
