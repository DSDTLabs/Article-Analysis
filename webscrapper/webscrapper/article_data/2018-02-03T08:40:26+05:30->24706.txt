BENGALURU: While the   and the   — the two national parties — are keen on single-phase polls in Karnataka, JD(S), the regional party, wants the election to be conducted in three phases. Other lesser-known parties want it in two-phases.

 “In the past, most assembly elections were held in a single day,” said BJP leader  . “One-day election in the state will be free and fair affair.”
 
 K E Radhakrishna, vicepresident,  , endorsed the view although he insisted that it was for the   (EC) to decide. “But the party will be happy if they hold elections in a single phase since we are confident that the administrative machinery in Karnataka is capable of handling law and order issues,” he said.
 
 However, Ramesh Babu, JD(S) official spokesperson, while batting for a three-phase poll, said there should be a gap of at least a couple of days between polling dates. He said the EC should appoint microobservers to deter efforts by the Congress and BJP to influence the poll process.
 
 A former bureaucrat associated with the EC said the decision on whether it should be single-phase or three-phase is based on various regional considerations such as the number of constituencies, local weather, regional events and state’s law and order situation among others.
 
 Political analyst Sandeep Shastri said, "Most political parties want single-phase polls since they believe it would be an advantage for campaigning and burn and reduce their costs. For parties a shorter campaign could mean a more focused electoral strategy too."
