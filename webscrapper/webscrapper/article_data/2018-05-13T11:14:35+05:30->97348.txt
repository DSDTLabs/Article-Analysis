AGRA: Former Vice President of India, Hamid  , on Saturday extended support to AMU students Union by describing their demand for judicial probe into May 2 violence as “justified”.
 
  In an email to   ( ) president Maskoor Ahmad Usmani, Ansari, who was in the campus on the fateful day to receive the lifetime membership of the union, wrote that the request for action, after a judicial inquiry, against right-wing activists who tried to barge into the campus was valid.
  
  Ansari wrote, “The programme of the day including an address by me in the Kennedy auditorium was publicly known. The authorities concerned had been intimated officially and were cognizant of the standard arrangements including security for such occasions. In view of it, the access of the intruders to a close proximity of the university guest house where I was staying remains unexplained.”
  
  “Also, the disruption, its precise timing and the excuses manufactured for justifying it raises questions. The peaceful protest by the students against this transgression is commendable. They must ensure that it doesn’t in any way interfere with their academic pursuits,” Ansari added,
  
  Incidentally, one of the demands of AMUSU includes constitution of a judicial inquiry against an alleged conspiracy to attack Ansari on the campus.
  
  However,   district magistrate CB Singh dismissed these allegations. “If Ansari, who was present on campus on that day, felt he was a target of miscreants, he would certainly have filed a complaint with police,” Singh said.
