JABALPUR/BHOPAL: A division bench of MP high court on Friday directed the Admission & Fee Regulatory Committee (AFRC) to carry out scrutiny of documents related to 107 medical students admitted to seven private medical colleges under   quota during the academic session 2017-18, once again.

 
 The court asked AFRC to look whether all norms laid down by the   for admission of NRI students to medical colleges in TS   case have been met or not.
 
 The bench comprising Justice   and Justice   passed the order while disposing of about 50 petitions filed by NRI students, whose admissions were cancelled by directorate of medical education (DME) following directives of the high court to seize papers of students given admission under NRI quota and through mop up round of counselling and carry out their scrutiny.
 
 In their petition, students had alleged that ‘undeserving’ students were admitted under NRI quota and mop up round of counselling in the private colleges in 2017-2018 session. In compliance to the court order, DME cancelled admission of 107 students. The students also filed a caveat in the HC charging that DME might have cancelled admissions in private colleges under NRI quota but they have not been expelled from their respective colleges and their names are still on the rolls. After hearing both the groups, the court, while staying the DME order, asked AFRC to carry out scrutiny of documents of these students once again to ascertain their veracity.
