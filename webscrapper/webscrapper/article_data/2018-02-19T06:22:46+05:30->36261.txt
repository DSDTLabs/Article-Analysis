HYDERABAD: Names of four Gitanjali   units owned by   accused Mehul Choksi had figured in the 2016 Comptroller Auditor General of India report on Gold, Precious Metals and Jewellery.

 The state auditor, which is highlighting round-tripping and inflation of export value of various diamond and gold companies, had given a damning report on discrepancies in Bond cum Legal Undertakings (BLUT) by the four companies in Hyderabad SEZ.
 
  
  
 
 
 The 2016 CAG report had stated that duties were fudged by Fantasy Diamond Cuts Pvt Ltd ( ),   ( ),   ( ) and D'Damas Jewellery Pvt Ltd of Choksi-owned Gitanjali Group.
 
 As per rule 22, SEZ Rules 2006, for availing exemptions concessions the unit had to execute BLUT on proper utilisation and accounting of goods, including capital goods, spares, raw materials components and consumables imported or procured duty-free. The value of BLUT was to be equal to number of duties to be levied on import or procurement from Domestic Tariff Area.
 
 CAG in the report said, “During scrutiny of BLUTs entered under Hyderabad commissionerate, the four units projected the value of imported capital goods and indigenous capital goods required. While arriving at the value of the bond, value of projected imported capital goods was divided into two for import and indigenous capital goods, instead of taking the consolidated projected value opf capital goods. Accordingly, the duties arrived at was based on incorrectly adopted values. This resulted in short valuation of BLUTs of Rs 3 crores.”
