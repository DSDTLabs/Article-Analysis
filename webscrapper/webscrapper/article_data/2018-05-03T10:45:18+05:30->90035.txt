JAIPUR: State parliamentary affairs minister   on Wednesday claimed that the state   had followed all norms and maintained a transparency while applying for land in Jaipur and other districts. 

 "The state BJP has applied for land for its offices at several districts across the state under the state's Land Allotment Policy 2015, which has provisions for land allotment to all registered political parties. The BJP government in the state was the first to form such a policy,'' said Rathore, while countering the allegations levelled by former chief minister Ashok Gehlot earlier in the day. Gehlot had questioned the government's move to allot land for BJP's offices in 25 districts and even warned government officials not to act under pressure.
 
 Accordingly, in Jaipur, a plot measuring 6,000 square meter in Jaipur, 3,000 square meter at the divisional level and 2,000 meter at the district level can be allotted to an applicant at the DLC and at 15 per cent more than the reserved price,'' said Rathore, adding that applications received by the state BJP were all made in a transparent manner.
 
 Gehlot is repeatedly warning officials, which in a way is hampering government work. He is also day dreaming about   coming back to power,'' said the senior minister.
 
 Rathore claimed that the chief minister through her frequent tours to the districts and programmes like 'Sarkar Aapke Dwar', 'Aapka zila,  ' and public hearings was reaching out to the masses. On the other hand, Gehlot is a leader who has seldom been among the masses, spoken the least in the state assembly and has not lead a single agitation or protest in the last four and a half years,'' he said, while addressing a press conference. He has been moved to Delhi and away from the state politics because of the infighting within the state Congress,'' he added.
