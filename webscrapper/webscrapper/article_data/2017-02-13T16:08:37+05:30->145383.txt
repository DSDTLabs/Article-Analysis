Olympic medal winning wrestler  , who got married exactly a month ago, is celebrating his first   with his beautiful wife  . 
Not known to express his feelings about anything other than sports and his mother, the Lover's Week has definitely had an impact on Yogeshwar too. Sharing his feelings about his bride, he says, "One thing that I love about Sheetal is that she cares for my family as much as she cares about me. She is a complete family girl, who has become an integral part of my family in one month. She really cares a lot for my mother and gives my brother the respect that he deserves as an elder. Seeing these beautiful qualities of hers, I feel that I'm really blessed. I really hope and pray that our love stays this simple and beautiful always."
