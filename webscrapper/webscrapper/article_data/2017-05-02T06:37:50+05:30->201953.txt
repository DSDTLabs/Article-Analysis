PATIALA: A   on Monday acquitted   (KTF) member Ramandeep Singh Goldy in the 2010 case of blast at   in the city.   Ravdeep Singh Hundal acquitted Goldy, who was extradited from Malaysia in November 2014, as he was wanted in the blast case and also for the killing of Rashtriya Sikh Sangat (RSS) state chief Rulda Singh. The second case is still pending in the court.

 Goldy’s counsel Brijinder Singh Sodhi said the prosecution had produced five witnesses to depose in support of the charges framed against him by the state police.
 
 The explosion at Arya Samaj Chowk of Paitala in April 2010, had left seven persons injured. “The following day, the district police claimed that the blast had been caused due to a short circuit. After eight days, the police came up with a theory that it was a terrorist attack,” Sodhi said. 
 
 In July 2010, the police arrested Harminder Singh, Manjinder Singh, Gurjant Singh and Jasvinder Singh and charged them and Goldy under various sections of the Explosives Act.
 
 In August 2014, the Patiala sessions court cleared the four persons of all the charges, but Goldy, who was brought back from Malaysia in November 2014, continued to face the case.
 
 The court took on record all the evidence put up by the prosecution and defence counsels during the earlier hearings in the case, which had culminated in the acquittal of four others. During the resumed hearing, five more witnesses were produced before the court.
