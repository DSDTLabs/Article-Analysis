Darbhanga: It’s strange but true that the   (DCE) has returned forged marksheets and other certificates to at least 10 of its 2014 batch students who had submitted original Matric and Intermediate documents at the time of their admission. There are 250 students in the 2014 batch.
 
  The aggrieved students locked the college principal and teachers in their chambers on Wednesday and lodged complaints with Darbhanga  , who has ordered a probe into it.
  
  DCE principal   admitted that original certificates of some students got lost and the staff concerned returned them forged documents.
  
  The DM said the college administration should have lodged an FIR and tried to procure duplicate of the documents from the respective examination boards. “Instead of following the rules, they issued forged documents. It is unbecoming of a prestigious institute like DCE,” he said.
  
  The DM said a committee of two senior district officials was investigating the issue. “I will take action, that may include lodging an FIR against the college administration, if the students’ allegations are found true,” he said.
  
  Officials in the college said students submit their original marksheets and Matric, Intermediate and migration certificates at the time of admission. The college principal attests the photocopy and send the documents to Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) for the students’ registration. Once the registration process is over, the college is supposed to return the original documents to the students.
  
  “When forged marksheets were issued to about 10 students, they started agitation and locked the principal and other teachers in their chambers on Tuesday and Wednesday,” said a college official, adding that the students relented only after the DM intervened.
