MUMBAI: Railway Police Force (RPF) personnel are yet to nab the   who pushed a   out of a running   in Virar last week. 

 RPF obtained   of the mugger from Virar and Nalasopara stations, but decided to get a   done based on the description provided by the victim, Komal Chavan (19). However, Komal, who is recuperating in hospital after a surgery to fix her dislocated right shoulder, has not been able to give a proper description of the accused. 
 
 RPF sources said the sketch does not entirely match with the image captured on CCTV cameras.
