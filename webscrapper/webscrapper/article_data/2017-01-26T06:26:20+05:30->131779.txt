JALANDHAR: It was 16 years back when   took up the challenging task of cleaning 160 km long water body, Kali Bein, a rivulet in Punjab. According to legend, first   had got enlightenment while sitting on its banks. His efforts have been awarded.
On Wednesday, Seechewal's name figured among 89 recipients who will receive the Padma Shri from the Union government.

Earlier,  , who planted thousands of trees and played major role in greening of the parts of Majha region was given this award in 2010. Baba Seechewal, is also responsible for forcing political parties to bring environment on their   and even after his appointment as member of the   (PPCB) he continued criticizing the official machinery for its failure on environmental issues, especially of dirty waters flowing in natural water channels.
 
 Rejuvenation of Kali Bein, despite its historic importance had either been made to dry up or was converted into a sewer drain at several places. Thousands of folks had participated in the cleaning of Kali Bein.Led by Baba Seechewal, they had descended in the slush, cleaned it and in a couple of years an almost dead rivulet was brought to life again. Then Indian President Dr A P J Abdul Kalam, had appreciated the project at several national and international seminares and also visited the Bein at Sultanour Lodhi, once when he was in office.
 
 However, this unique project faced hiccups more from official and political side. Once, late BJP MLA Amarjit Singh Sahi even got flow of fresh water stopped in the Bein in January 2011.
 
 Despite Dr Kalam praising the project and even questioning state government during his visit in 2006 about the dirty water flowing in the Bein, used water of some villages and at least of one municipal committee still flows in the rivulet.
