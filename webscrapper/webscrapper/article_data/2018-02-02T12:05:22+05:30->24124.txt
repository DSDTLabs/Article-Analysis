DEHARDUN: District magistrate S A Murugesan on Thursday constituted a committee to demarcate 200 acres area known as MI 122 in  , 30 km from Dehradun, within 10 days for residential and industrial use.
 
  The committee will consist of additional district magistrate and officials from state industrial development authority (SIDA), special area development authority (SADA), district industries centre (DIC) and industries.
  
  Murugesan said, “The industrialists complained that the residential houses were being built alongside industries, leading to conflicts. The problems could further aggravate, so I have given direction to the committee to demarcate the entire area within 10 days.”
  
  Mahesh Sharma, president of   industrial association raised the matter saying that some people objected to the noise caused by industrial units in the vicinity and demanded shut down. He demanded clear identification of the land so that such issues do not crop up in near future. “Earlier SADA which was conversant with the Dehradun master plan was clearing the maps for residential and industrial units separately. But ever since CEDA has been entrusted the charge some four years ago, it has been unable to discharge its duties.”
  
  General manager of DIC, Shikhar Saxena, said, “There is lot of vacant land lying in the area so the committee would demarcate the land before more buildings or industrial units come up.”
