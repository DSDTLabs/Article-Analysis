HYDERABAD: Governor   will take a final call on the relocation of   who were relieved by the Telangana government citing Andhra  . A meeting with representatives of both states will be held on March 9, where both sides will submit arguments.

 Telangana relieved 1,254 employees working in T Transco, TGenco and discoms. The AP government says it has identified only 710 staffers with AP nativity.
 
 As per rule, those who have completed seven years of school education in Telangana should be treated as a native. “The issue of nativity should be decided on the basis of existing law. We have followed the procedure and come to the conclusion that only 710 staff are of AP nativity,” said a senior AP official.
 
 But Telangana employee unions argue that nativity should be on the basis of ‘place of birth’. They also allege that many have submitted forged educational documents to gain Telangana nativity.
 
 “We have submitted the demands raised by our employee unions to the high-power committee, in which ministers of both states are members,” said a senior official from Telangana Transco.
