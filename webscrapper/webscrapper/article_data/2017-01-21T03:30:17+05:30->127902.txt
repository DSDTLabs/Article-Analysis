NEW DELHI: The race for the   police   of Delhi seems to be getting tougher as the government is apparently open to considering officers other than the obvious contenders from Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union Territories (AGMUT) cadre, sources said. 

 Shivanand Jha, a 1983-batch officer and   from the 1984-batch are also in the   of probables, it is learnt. The two officers from Gujarat cadre, interestingly, were strong contenders for the post even last year after B S Bassi retired. However, the government chose not to ignore seniority and brought in Alok Verma, a 1979 batch officer.
 
 Asthana is currently the interim director of CBI and would be the second-in-command after Verma joins next week. Jha is currently serving as police chief in Ahmedabad.
 
 The government will have to announce the name by next week. Deepak Mishra and   — 1984-batch officers — are the frontrunners for the post of the capital’s top cop.
 
 Sources also pointed towards a possibility of   having strong chances of being elevated to the post as Mishra and Kumar are already on central deputation and serving in CRPF and CISF respectively. Patnaik, a 1985-batch officer, is currently the second-in-command at   and posted as special commissioner, administration. However, the government is unlikely to bypass the seniority.
 
 Other probables include enforcement directorate chief Karnal Singh, J K Sharma and A K Singh who are from the 1984-batch and 1985-batch officer S N Shrivastava. Outgoing chief Verma is likely to continue till Republic Day celebrations are over.
