MADURAI: People are anticipating a DMK rule led by   in the state due to the continuing confusion and fluid situation in the ruling party, said member of parliament K   on Sunday. 

 Kanimozhi told reporters that the present political scenario was not good for a democratically-elected government and governance had been stalled in the state. As the Tamil Nadu governor was also not taking a decision, the people are a confused lot. “Everyone is taking arbitrary decisions and switching sides. Now people have started believing that only the DMK can give them a stable government,” she said.
 
 There was no truth in the allegations that DMK was behind the troubles in AIADMK as there was no need for the party to indulge in such a move, she said adding that ``very soon we will see a government led by M K   in the state.’’ 
 
 Meanwhile, in a boost to Panneerselvam, S R Thevar, general secretary, All India Munvender Munnani Kazhagam, told reporters that they were extending support to the chief minister. This was because he was chosen by the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa to represent her not once but twice and also by the MLAs of AIADMK after her death. He said attempts to threaten him into subservience will not be tolerated. The   also strongly condemned the illegal confinement of MLAs and wanted the police to ensure that they were allowed to function freely.
 
 Supporters of Panneerselvam and   who staged a protest in   in Madurai came face to face causing some tense moments on Sunday. A group led by AIADMK Porur secretary Pappu Reddy staged a protest near the Vadipatti bus stand demanding that Sasikala be made the chief minister. Soon, another group backing O Panneerselvam led by ward secretary Veerabahudevan and others staged a protest near the same spot carrying placards in support of OPS. Samyanallur police came to the spot and held talks with both the groups after which they dispersed.
