AHMEDABAD: After education minister   expressed a wish that teachers wear khadi once a week, Ahmedabad district primary education officer ( ) has made it mandatory.

 DPEO Mahesh Maheta issued a circular making it compulsory for all primary teaches at district   to wear khadi on Tuesdays. While male teachers have not been asked to wear a particular type of clothing, the DPEO formed a committee to take a final decision on the uniform to be worn by female teachers. The committee will decide whether female teachers should wear sarees or salwar-kameez. It will also take a decision on whether the female teachers should wear all white on Tuesdays. If it is not white, the uniform colour will be finalized by the committee.
 
 Sources said the committee will intimate all schools about the uniform for female teachers.
 
 As the Ahmedabad DPEO has taken the ministerâ€™s agenda a step further, it is believed that officials in other districts are also likely to follow the suit. On January 30, while observing Shaheed Din, Chudasama exhorted teachers and other staff at schools and in the education department to wear khadi every week.
