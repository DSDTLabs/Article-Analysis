MUMBAI: BEST workers will take out a   at Wadala depot on February 12 to again protest the delay in payment of their salaries. The BEST workers action committee, in a statement, said, “Even thought February 10 has lapsed, the undertaking has not paid salaries to the workers. A massive morcha is planned to give warning to the administration against the delay in disbursing salaries.”

 BEST is feeling under financial crisis and is reliant on   to bail it out. The BMC had, in December, threatened to recover the Diwali bonus from workers' salaries if the turnaround measures suggested by BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta were not implemented by the BEST administration.
