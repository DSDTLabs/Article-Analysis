Indore: The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court passed an order allowing IMC to take effective steps against 52 constructions that were obstructions along a road between Zanjeerwala Square to Patnipura Square via Malwa Mill Square.

 The order was passed by the division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Vivek Rusia who also directed IMC to submit a compliance report of the action in the next two months.
 
 The petition challenging IMC’s notice to remove the constructions, filed by Mahendra Vijayvargiya in 2014 and ten other petitioners, was converted by the court into a public interest litigation to monitor the progress of the road widening project.
 
 The road between Malwa Mill Square and Patnipura is 80 metres and needed to be widened to 104 metres as per the city’s master plan. The constructions in this patch were issued notices by IMC in 2014, after which 11 petitions were moved before the high court.
 
 Passing an interim order, the court on August 8, 2014 granted the petitioners a stay on the removal action.
 
 The court dismissed 10 of these petitions on May 15, 2016, maintaining one petition for the purpose of monitoring the course of action adopted by the corporation to ensure early completion of the road widening project.
 
 “However, petitioners claimed their property could not be removed since the interim order was still valid. Clarifying the situation on the interim order, the court has ruled that at present there is no interim order against IMC,” Rishi Tiwari, IMC’s counsel said.
 
 The court has directed the IMC to ‘take effective steps in the matter and submit progress report in two months’.
