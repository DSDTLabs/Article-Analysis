 is one of those actors you can love or hate, but can't ignore. A bit outlandish, sometimes weird and most of the times, quirky, when it comes to his fashion sense, the actor never fails to surprise (rather shock) us. Styled by Nitisha Gaurav, the actor has his own fashion norms and love to defies what's trending. Here's a look at top 5 outfits worn by Ranveer that sent shock waves across the fashion fraternity.

  1. The actor rocked this rust-tinted suit along with blanket-like cape, that too with swag! 
  
 
 2. No other actor can pull off a pleated skirt like him. And, don't forget to notice his gladiator shoes...whoa! 
  
 
 3. He's wearing this quirky, print on print outfit like it is NBD! Yay or nay...we leave it on you to decide. 
  
 
 4. This quirky coat with gladiator sandals, he surely knows how to make a fashion statement. 
  
 
 5. Ranveer deserves drum rolls for carrying off this look so confidently. A statement t-shirt with a silk gown, pyjamas and Sylvester slippers...that too at an award ceremony! He surely made more heads turn than any of the other   celebs.
