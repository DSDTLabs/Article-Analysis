CHENNAI: Three 'considerate' robbers posing as policemen waylaid a   in the early hours of Sunday. The three men took the old man in an autorickshaw to a secluded spot near   on the pretext of investigating him. They took away his 3-gram gold ring and Rs 700 at knifepoint and gave him Rs15 to find his way back home. 

 The septuagenarian, R Mani, used the paltry sum to reach the Abhiramapuram police station where he filed a complaint within hours of the incident. A resident of   Street, Govindasamy Nagar, RA Puram, Mani works as a security guard at a building in RA Puram 4th street. 
 
 On Sunday, around 5am, Mani was riding his bicycle to report to work when he was intercepted by an autorickshaw, a few 100 metres from his workplace. Three men got out of the autorickshaw, gheraoed the elderly man and started speaking to him in a threatening tone. The men claimed themselves to be policemen and said that they have suspicions about him and asked him to get inside the autorickshaw, according to the complaint. They further told him that they already have four persons under custody in connection with the case. 
 
 The shocked elderly man soon found himself at a secluded spot near Guindy where he was alighted. The trio then held the man at knifepoint and robbed him of Rs 700, besides the 3-gram gold ring he was wearing, and fled the spot. However, before fleeing the spot, one of the three men gave Rs15 to the elderly man to return home, according to the police.
 
 Based on the identity given by the elderly man, the police have launched a hunt for the trio. "We are also looking for CCTV footage from the scene of crime to find the vehicle number, which could lead us to the offenders," said an investigating officer.
