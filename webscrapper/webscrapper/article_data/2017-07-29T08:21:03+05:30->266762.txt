PUNE: Under the Building and Other   of 1996,   must conduct regular and   on  . However, this rarely happens as the labour department is skeletal-staffed.

 The Pune district has close to 3,700 projects that are under several stages of construction.Against this, the labour department in Pune barely has three officers and nine inspectors to boot.
 
 Even the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) speaks nothing about construction workers' safety . After accidents, most of them fatal, it has been found that even the so-called renowned developers have not registered their workforce with the labour welfare office. At best estimates, less than a third of over 1.5 lakh construction labourers in the district are registered with the office. Also, this figure goes down in the subsequent year as labourers migrate. Police commissioner Rashmi Shukla said, “The police come into the picture when accidents take place, for which we take strict legal action.“
 
 
 
 
 Some developers are seri ous about safety . They provide equipment to the labourers, who cite reasons like hot weather and habit, to not wear the safety gear, Jaiprakash Shroff, chairman, Kushal -a skill development initiative of  , said.
 
 
 
 In case of accidents, police are prosecuting the contractor and his staffers under section 304 (a) (causing death due to negligence) of the IPC. If the accident is serious, then the builder should also be prosecuted under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC because it is his responsibility to ensure that safety standards are adhered to, experts said.
