AMETHI: Assuring the people of his constituency, Congress president   said on Tuesday that his commitment for   will stay intact whether he remains an MP or not.

 The Amethi MP, however, ducked the questions of some girl students of   at Rasta Mau.
 
 “Government makes laws but why are they not implemented in our village?” a girl asked.
 
 Rahul ducked the question, saying, “Yeh aap Modi ji se poochhiye.. meri sarkar thodi hi hai. Jab hamari sarkar hogi toh humse poochhiyega (You ask this question to Prime Minister  . It’s not my government. You ask me this question when Congress comes to power).”
 
 Dissatisfied with the reply, when the girl countered saying that she was talking about Amethi, Rahul put the blame on UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “Yogiji runs Amethi now. I am an MP. My job is to make laws in Lok Sabha,” he said.
 
 Attacking Yogi, Rahul said, “Yogi ji ka kaam UP ko chalane ka hai, par woh doosre kaam kar rahe hain... bijli ka kaam nahi kar rahe hain, pani ka kaam nahi kar rahe hain, shiksha ka kaam nahi kar rahe hain... bas krodh phaila rahe hain... jisse dange ho rahe hain, aatank phail raha hai (It’s Yogiji’s job to run UP but he is busy elsewhere. He is not working to ensure electricity, water supply, education. He is only spreading hatred which is causing riots, spreading fear).”
 
 The interaction, that took place on the first day of his visit to Amethi, also found mention in Rahul’s speech later in the day. Addressing a gathering, Rahul said, “Girls in a school asked some very pertinent questions to me. And I feel that children are our future.”
 
 Rahul urged children to stand up against rising hatred.
 
 “Whenever you come across anyone you feel is spreading hatred, walk up to them, stare into their eyes and tell them that you are the future of the country and that no one one can play with your future. India will grow with love and communal amity and stop dividing the country,” he said.
