PUNE: A   here has ruled that an elected candidate cannot be prevented from functioning as a   merely because the losing candidate has apprehended in a petition that he was elected using corrupt practice.

 Judge Sanjashree Gharat made the observation while rejecting the application by Shiv Sena’s losing candidate Gangadhar Bhade seeking a temporary injunction to prevent BJP’s winning candidate   from functioning as a corporator from the   ward.
 
 Badhe’s application was part of an election petition filed under the   (MMC) Act challenging Tilekar’s election on various grounds. Since the petition will take time for final disposal, he had pleaded for temporary injunction.
 
 Tilekar’s lawyer   brought to the court’s notice that the MMC Act has no provision for grant of an interim relief in an election petition. Kinkar cited a Bombay HC judgment in support of her argument. The court held that it had no powers to grant interim relief.
