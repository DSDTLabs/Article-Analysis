Greater Noida: A 28-year-old man, heavily drunk, allegedly stabbed a cow to death with a knife after stealing the animal from a neighbour’s shed in Surajpur on Thursday evening. Police have arrested the accused, Chandra Shekhar, but are yet to establish any motive behind the crime.

 The family of Lakhiram, who owned the 14-month-old cow, has denied any personal enmity with Chandra.
 
 TOI spoke to a number of villagers in the neighbourhood but they, too, could not assign any motive to the act, except that Chandra was too drunk to know what he was doing.
 
 Lakhiram said he went home for dinner at 8pm on Thursday when Chandra sneaked into his cowshed near the field. There were 15 cows in the shed and the accused allegedly dragged one of them to the nearby field. “I returned to the shed and found one of the cows missing. I started searching for the animal thinking it might have strayed into the fields,” Lakhiram said.
 
 The farmer said he found the animal critically wounded nearly 100 metres from the shed. “Chandra Shekhar was standing near the cow. He had a blood-stained knife in the hand. When I asked him if he had killed the cow, he pushed me and fled the spot,”Lakhiram said.
 
 The farmer informed the villagers. Members of some cow vigilante groups also reached there and started a demonstration demanding that the accused be arrested.
 
 Ved Nagar, a member of the Gau Raksha Dal, said the accused had hurt religious sentiments by slaughtering a cow. “The police should take strong action against him,” he said.
 
 Police force was deployed around the village to ensure law and order was maintained. The team arrested Chandra from his rented accommodation.
