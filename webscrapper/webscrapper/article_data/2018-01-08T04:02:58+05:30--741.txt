MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has directed a   woman, involved in a divorce and custody battle with her husband, to take the couple's 7-year-old son back to Pune and readmit him in his school. The woman had last year left for her father's place in Mumbai and admitted her son to a reputed school in the city, despite an oral undertaking that she will not take her child out of Pune. 

 "The fact that the child was born in Pune and lived there till he was removed, cannot be lost sight of at this stage," said a division bench of Justices R Savant and S  , adding, "We are of the view that he would not suffer if he is moved back to Pune." The bench last week refused a plea by the mother to extend the time given to shift the child back to Pune.
 
 The court also frowned on the conduct of the woman in lodging proceedings in the high court and other courts including a domestic violence case where she asked for a permanent custody of her son, even as proceedings were pending in the family court. The bench observed that the situation could have been avoided and agreed with the man's lawyers that the proceedings lodged by the woman before the Parsi Matrimonial court "amounted to abuse of the process of law". The court was hearing the woman's appeal against a single judge's order asking her to go back to Pune with her child.
 
 The couple had married in 2008 and their son was born in 2010. In 2017, the man approached the Pune district court and filed a plea for divorce and custody of the minor son. He also sought an injunction against his wife taking their son our of Pune or taking admission for the child in any school outside the city.
 
  According to the lawyers representing the husband, despite an oral undertaking, the woman took the couple's son to Mumbai and got him admitted in a school. She also instituted proceedings before the high court to restrain her husband from forcibly taking possession of their son.
