PATNA:   CM   on Monday avoided any direct comment on the issue of   Muslims from  .   said his party JD(U) was yet to discuss the issue.

 Nitish’s silence on this issue assumes significance as the NDA government at the Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that it has intelligence inputs about the links of some Rohingya Muslims illegally settled in India with the Islamic State and Pakistan’s ISI and they were “a serious security threat to the country”. Nitish’s JD(U) is now part of the NDA.
 
 To a question about the BJP-led NDA government’s decision to deport illegal Rohingya Muslims from India, Nitish, whose party to some extent rely on Muslim support in Bihar, only said, “JD(U) is yet to discuss the matter.” However, he hastened to add that personally he would go in favour of ‘insaniyat’ (humanity).
