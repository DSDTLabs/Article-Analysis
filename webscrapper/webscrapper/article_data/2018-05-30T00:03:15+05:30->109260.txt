Vijayawada:  ,  , who is know for his sensational remarks, on Tuesday said that teleconferences held by   N   are cause of concern as officials are not focusing on administration on pretext of teleconferences.

 Speaking at the Mahandu here, he said that the CM is working hard, and officials have become like former chief pontiff of TTD, Ramana Deekshitulu, and the CM like a deity. 
 
 “I am not being harsh, many facts are not being presented before the CM, and I am saying we need to check the mess in Janmabhoomi committees also,” he said. “There is a need to cancel the Janmabhoomi committees. I don’t have any wrong intention in saying this, I want the CM to play a big role in national politics. Why cannot he be the prime minister? He has vast experience as CM.” 
 
 Reddy also suggested that the party should be handed over to Naidu’s son Lokesh, and that there is nothing wrong if Lokesh becomes the chief minister of the state.
 
 Reddy said he had told the CM many times that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not grant special status to AP. “I had the opportunity to have tea with Modi twice. Whenever I asked about special status, he did not say anything. As long as Modi is PM, special status will not be granted to Andhra,” he said.
