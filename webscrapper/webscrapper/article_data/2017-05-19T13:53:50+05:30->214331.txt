 Over 70 cases of KFD, also known monkey fever, have been detected in Goa since January this year, including one each at Patradevi in the Pernem taluka and at   in the Ponda taluka. The disease is caused by a virus that is transmitted through tick bites.
 
 Joshi, who is also the spokesperson of the All Goa Farmer’s Sangh, said the vaccination drive by the government to immunize citizens against the disease was inadequate and that more efforts were required to control the state’s monkey population.
 
 In the PIL, he has sought that farmers be granted arms licences to tackle attacks by infected monkeys.
 
 While this throws in the debate of the vermin issue— the Rhesus macaque is a Schedule 1 species—Joshi argued that Himachal Pradesh has declared this monkey as vermin, thus legalizing its culling, and demanded that Goa follow suit
 
 He also demanded compensation to the kin of deceased KFD victims.
