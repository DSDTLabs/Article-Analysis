BHUBANESWAR: An MBA pass-out was arrested amongst three others here on Sunday in connection with March 21 theft of a taxi in Khandagiri area. Police said  , who works as sales manager in an electronics showroom here after completing his MBA from a private institute in 2015, is suspected to have committed similar offences here in the past. 

 His arrested accomplices were identified as  , 25, Sandeep Nayak, 27 and  , 31. Police said Priyadarshan, who stays in Mancheswar area here, booked the App-based taxi service through his cell phone. Driver   reached Khandagiri around 11.40 pm to pick and drop Priyadarshan at Bharatpur in the city. On the way, the other three accused waylaid the car, dragged Pradhan out on gunpoint and drove away with the car.
 
 DCP Satyabrata Bhoi said the accused persons fled to Kolkata and sold the car for only Rs 1.20 lakh. To hoodwink the police, Priyadarshan had thrown his cell phone, using which he had booked the car, into the Ganges. But his luck ran out when he inserted the same SIM in another mobile phone. “We traced his mobile and caught him here a few days ago. He took us to Kolkata from where we recovered the stolen car. Subsequently, we arrested his three friends,” Bhoi told TOI. 
 
 Police said criminal antecedents of Priyadarshan, who earns nearly Rs 20,000 salary per month, are being verified. “So far, we came to know that his gang member Pintu Digal is a dreaded criminal, who was arrested several times earlier by Nayapalli police,” Bhoi said.
 
 Police said Pintu was wanted in a sensational rape and dacoity case in G Udayagiri area in Kandhamal police station last year. In March 2016, Pintu and four others allegedly stormed into the house of one David   with the motive to commit dacoity. Police said the accused gang-raped Naik’s maid and assaulted other family members before looting the household articles worth over Rs two lakh. While four persons were arrested, Pintu was on the run.
