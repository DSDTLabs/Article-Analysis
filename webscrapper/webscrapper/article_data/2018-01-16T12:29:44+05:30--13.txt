AHMEDABAD: Kite flying tradition on the occasion of Uttarayan has turned out to be a nightmare for humans and birds alike in Gujarat.

 At least 16 people died and scores of others sustained serious injuries in kite flying-related accident in Gujarat. 
 
 While most victims died after their throats were slit by the glass-coated manjha, other deaths occurred when the people fell from terraces or were electrocuted while trying to catch kites.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 The celebrations turned out to be deadly for birds as well. In the two days of Uttarayan festivities, the forest department rescued and treated 4,026 birds, of which 214 died during treatment. The city reported 1,935 bird injuries, of which 139 birds died. Several NGOs were also involved in bird rescues in the state. 
 
 Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) G K Sinha said, “This year 4,026 birds have been rescued and the number was less than in 2017. Last year, there were 8,300 rescues.” Sinha said, “This year, Karuna Abhiyan has reached all talukas and reports from smaller towns or cities have been received. Moreover, around 20 lakh schoolchildren took pledges to save birds. We take this as a credit, as despite extensive coverage, the number of birds treated is less than last year.”
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 At least six flights were delayed after Chinese lanterns, kites and traditional tukkals fell on the runway at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad since Sunday.
 
 
 
 Airport authorities had to constantly ensure that the approach or the funnel of the runway was clear before they allowed any flights to take off or land. 
 
 Police and airport authorities have repeatedly warned of cut kites and paper lanterns coming in the path of landing aircraft. In several instances in the past, kites and flying lanterns came in the path of an aircraft.
