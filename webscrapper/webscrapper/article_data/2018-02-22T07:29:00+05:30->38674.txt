Chandigarh: A public toilet in the fruit-selling section of the Sector-26 Grain Market is proving so small for the visitors that they have turned its outer wall into an open urinal.

 This toilet is on the Police Lines road at the south end of the crowded market. You can identify it by the heaps of rotting fruits and vegetables lying around and a platform where fruit vendors bathe in full public view. The visitors confirm that the toilet had inadequate urinals for all the daily rush coming to the market, so they are forced to use the toilet wall. The entire wall and even the nearby floor are wet with discharge, and it is difficult to even walk past this stretch.
 
 Channa, a cobbler working nearby told TOI: “Even though this toilet is dirty, it is the only one we have, since the municipal corporation built no other in the entire grain market.” The water supply to the toilet is erratic and so its rooftop storage tank goes empty a couple of times in a month. “In that situation, there is no water left in the flush tank and people go out to ease themselves.”
 
 Flies hover over the garbage from the fruit stalls around the toilet and insects crawl on the toilet floor and the urine-painted wall. “We have no other option but to urinate on the wall,” Fruit vendor Manoj said. “There are far too many of us—almost 700 or more—and hundreds of buyers also visit the market all day. But the market committee has taken no note of our repeated requests for new toilets.”
 
 In the dock
 
 Confronted over the messy situation, UT public health department superintending engineer Rajinder Singh Ahluwalia said: “Maintaining toilets in   is the market committee’s responsibility.”
