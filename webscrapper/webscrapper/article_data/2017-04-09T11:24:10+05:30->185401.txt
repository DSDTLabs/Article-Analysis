IMPHAL: As the stand-off between protesters and the government over the   (ILP)-like bills continues, governor Najma Heptulla on Saturday appealed to the Churachandpur-based   (JAC) appealed to the   Joint Action Committee (JAC) to allow last rites to be performed for the eight protesters whose bodies are still   at the morgue. 

 Nine protesters were killed in violence, including six who died in police action, at Churachandpur during a protest against the passing of three bills which would enforce restrictions similar to those required in states where an ILP is required. The bills were "anti-tribal", protesters had said. The bodies of eight of the deceased have since been lying unclaimed at the morgue of the district hospital at Churachandpur. One body had been taken away by family last year.
 
 The first round of talks between the protesting JAC and the state government was held with chief minister N Biren Singh in the chair on Friday. The talks were said to have taken a positive direction. 
 
 "I am happy the new government has taken the initiative to break the ice between the government and the   the anti-tribal bills and to bring the leaders of the latter to the negotiation table," said a statement issued by the Imphal Raj Bhavan. "There is nothing that cannot be resolved through dialogue," the statement added.
 
 It further said, "I fervently appeal to all concerned, particularly the JAC, to allow a decent burial with all religious rites of the dead bodies."
