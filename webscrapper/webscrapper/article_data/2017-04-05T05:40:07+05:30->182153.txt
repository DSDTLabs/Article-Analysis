JAIPUR: Investigating the case of a   who was arrested a couple of days ago,   and   said   will soon visit the state to interrogate the accused. As the accused had jumped   in Haryana where he had several cases of murder and extortion against him, Haryana police will take him in custody soon. 

 Senior officers of ATS and Alwar police said Haryana police has enquired about Kuldeep Yadav after his arrest and they are likely to visit Alwar to apply for his custody. It may be recalled that Kuldeep Yadav was arrested on Saturday by the team of Rajasthan ATS from Rishikesh. He escaped from Alwar jail and was on the run since December 2015. During the time, he had also stolen an SUV from Alwar which was used in a murder he executed in Haryana.
 
 “They have checked with us about his arrest as he is a big criminal in Haryana. There is a possibility that they will visit Alwar and apply for his custody to send him back in Haryana jail from where he had jumped parole,” said a senior officer of Alwar police. 
 
 Police said investigations suggest that Yadav had an identity card of Alwar police which he used to evade arrest. “We have also sought information from Haryana police if any of their policemen had his ID card missing. Prima facie the card appears to be fake still it needs to be verified by Haryana police,” said an officer.
