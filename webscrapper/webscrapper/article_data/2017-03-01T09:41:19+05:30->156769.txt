UDAIPUR: In a heart rending incident, a woman was brutally   by her husband and father-in-law at   village in   under   in Udaipur. 

 They committed the cruel act allegedly because the woman happened to answer a call from an unknown person. The woman has suffered burn injuries almost everywhere on her body including private parts. Shockingly, when the incident was reported to police, they did a cover up act and registered it as a petty case by granting bail to the accused at police station itself.
 
  The incident came to light when a social worker, Bhojraj Singh, came to know of it and reported it to the media, higher authorities and  . The victim, Jhamku (22), was married to one Bhagga Gameti two years ago. She received a call from an unknown number which she happened to answer a week back. Overhearing the conversation, Bhagga and his father too spoke to the caller and failing to idenfy the caller, they suspected Jhamku was having an illegal affair with the caller. 
 
 Both the men physically tortured the helpless woman and not contented by the treatment, Bhagga took a hot iron (chimta) and branded her all over the body. No one from the village came to her rescue and finally she fell unconscious. Jhamku's mother-in-law too had a hand in instigating the men for the cruelty, the victim said.
