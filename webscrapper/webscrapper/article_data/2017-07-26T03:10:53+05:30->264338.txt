NEW DELHI: CPM’s central committee, the highest decision-making body of the party, has struck down a third-term in   for its general secretary Sitaram   whose second term is due to end on August 28. With no alternative name proposed by the committee, the party has, in effect, decided to give up its claim to a seat in the upper House.

 The stormy meeting of the deeply divided central committee finally saw the triumph of the Kerala lobby, led by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who dug in his heels and voted against a third term for Yechury. On the other hand, the West Bengal unit, which Yechury represents in Parliament and which sought a third term for him as an exception, cited previous departures from the party’s “two-term rule”.
 
 Though a formal announcement regarding Yechury was not made on Tuesday, senior party functionaries confirmed to TOIthat the central committee has opposed his candidature for now. The central committee will meet again on Tuesday morning.
 
 The denial of Yechury’s re-nomination would signal the further weakening of the Left’s voice in Parliament as it will bring to an end Yechury’s illustrious 12-year stint in the Rajya Sabha where he made an impact as a member of the opposition benches.
 
 Yechury's re-election, sources told TOI, was opposed for two reasons. It was argued that the party’s constitution allows only two terms in the upper House for a member. Further, the Kerala lobby, while appreciating Yechury’s contribution as a parliamentarian, was opposed to taking Congress’ support in West Bengal to send him to the upper House.
