National award-winning filmmaker   said he is planning to soon work with megastar  .

  
  
 After his last feature film 'Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh' asked about his upcoming project, Ghosh said "Well, I am writing a script and hopefully I will be working with Amit Ji (Amitabh Bachchan). I think Amitabh Bachchan is a bad habit, if you work with him once, you want to work again and again."
 
 "I have so many fond memories of him. I wish to work with him soon."
 
 Big B first time tried out singing a  's memorable poem ' ' in Ghosh's directorial venture 'Kahaani' - which went on to win three National awards. In 2016, Sujoy produced the film 'Te3n' in which Big B not only appeared in a pivotal role but also sang the song 'Kyun Re'.
 
 He always supported me, whenever I went to him with anything, any offers, I never came back empty handed. I think that is the greatness of that man," Ghosh added.
