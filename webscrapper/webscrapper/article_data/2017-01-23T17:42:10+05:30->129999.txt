Pop star   has hit out at his ex Selena Gomez's rumored boyfriend  , saying he "can't listen" to his music because it is "wack". 

 When asked by TMZ if he listens to The Weeknd's songs, the 22-year-old singer said, "Hell no I can't listen to a Weeknd song! That's wack."
 
 According to the publication, this is not the first time Bieber has slammed the "Starboy" hit-maker, as it previously reported that the Canadian singer thinks Gomez and The Weeknd's alleged relationship is a strategic move on the part of the 24-year-old songstress and that she is using him. 
 
 The Weeknd's former girlfriend Bella Hadid, is also reportedly upset with him as he moved on with Gomez so quickly. 
 
 The 20-year-old model dated the singer, 26, for nearly a year and a half before they called it quits last November.
