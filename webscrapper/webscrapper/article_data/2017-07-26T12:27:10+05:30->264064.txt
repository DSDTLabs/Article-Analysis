CHANDIGARH: Treatment is available for the one-year-old baby from Amritsar who has severe obesity and weighs 20 kg, according to a doctor at PGIMER.

 PGIMER’s Dr Devi Dayal said Chahat, whose severe obesity has been caused by a genetic mutation, could be treated with recombinant therapy. The blood sample of the baby was sent to Medgenome Laboratory at Bengaluru last month and CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi. The Bengaluru report has found leptin gene mutation. Leptin is a gene that regulates body weight. 
 
 Though the treatment is not available in the PGIMER as the doctors here have not managed such a case, there are nearby institutes in Delhi where the child can be treated. “This is the first time that a unique case of early onset of obesity has been reported in the PGIMER. The genetic test report of Chahat has found the cause of her early onset of obesity to a rare mutation in the leptin gene. This gene is involved in the regulation of body weight,” said a doctor in the PGIMER. 
 
 As the mutation is not on leptin receptor, the condition is treatable, he said. “We have not dealt with such treatment. So, we will try and see how the patient can be helped for an affordable treatment,” said Dr Devi Dayal, the physician who is treating the baby. “We will screen the family members of the baby to understand the mutation before starting any treatment.”
 
 Chahat’s parents have been asked to report at the PGIMER next month for her further check-up. “She has not gained weight, as she has been following a diet pattern we offered, which is a good response,” said Dr Dayal. Sources inform that the cost of treatment in almost all cases would be impossible to be borne by the family and would require assistance in form of government support or philanthropy.
