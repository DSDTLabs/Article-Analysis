 Later, day two was dedicated to music where people witnessed the A/V presentation showcasing the history of Blues and Jazz. A live tabla and sarangi music performance by father-son duo, Rajesh and Manish, respectively, earned them a huge round of applause. The fest culminated on a musical note where the Lucknow based music band- Harmony, performed Hindi and English songs like 'Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho', 'Jiyein Kyun', 'Crazy Little Things', 'Mexico', among others. "With the aim to keep it an infotainment initiative, we came with our first expo to preserve art and music which people are forgetting these days. It was a move to make people aware that the Blues and Jazz still hold the same essence like they did a century back," said Dr Ashutosh Singh, one of the organisers.
