RAJKOT: Cracks appeared within Alpesh Thakor-led Gujarat   on Sunday when nearly 1,000 members in Banaskantha district resigned, accusing the feisty OBC leader of using them to nurture his political ambitions. 

 Those who resigned were from five talukas namely Bhabhar, Suigam, Lakhni, Deodar and Vav.
 
  Talking to media persons, president of the outfit’s Deodar unit,   said, “Alpesh’s autocratic attitude has left thousands of the workers angry and compelled to quit. He has used the social organization to nurture his political ambitions. Now, he is planning to field the candidates from organization on all the seats in ensuing assembly elections. 
 
 Manuji said, “We along with hundreds of the workers have resigned with a heavy heart while there are many others who have informed me over phone about their intention to quit. The organization has been veered away from its fundamental ideology of working to strengthen prohibition and welfare of the community.”
 
 “The outfit has become a political one instead of a social organization,” he alleged.
 
 However, Banaskantha district president of the organization,   termed the resignation as a ploy to defame the organization. “We have sacked Manuji and Jagdish Thakor who are trying to defame the organization with such allegations,” he said.
