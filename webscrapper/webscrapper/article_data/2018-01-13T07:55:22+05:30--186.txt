NEW DELHI: The   ( ) on Friday appointed   as the chairman of its medical commission, a decision which is likely to raise a few eyebrows.

 
 Pawandeep's role as the chief medical officer of the Indian contingent at the   had come under scanner after reports emerged that he was a radiologist by profession and proved to be of little help to the Indian athletes during the Games when they suffered injuries.
 
 Reports had also claimed that Pawandeep, son of veteran sports administrator  , prescribed 'combiflam' to the country's athletes when they complained of pain. His role came into the spotlight after woman wrestler Vinesh Phogat suffered a serious knee injury during her bout at the Games.
 
 However, Tarlochan had defended his son's knowledge of sports medicine, arguing that Pawandeep was the head of the medical team at the SAF Games in Guwahati and Shillong and a member of the   Medical Commission. 
 
 Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had, later, launched a preliminary enquiry against Pawandeep and another person, RS Negi, following allegations that the two didn't have the requisite qualification and experience in sports medicine but were still sent to the Games from July 24 to August 23, 2016. Reports alleged that Negi, too, was a radiologist.
 
 Pawandeep's latest appointment will mark the beginning of his second successive term as the chairman of the medical commission after serving under the regime of former IOA president N Ramachandran.
 
 When TOI contacted IOA's secretary general Rajeev Mehta, he denied his involvement in making any such appointment. "I have no knowledge about these appointments," Mehta said.
 
 Meanwhile, senior sports administrator Anil Khanna was named chairman of the finance commission, while the advisory committee comprised of Tarlochan, GS Mander, S Regunathan and BS Landge.
