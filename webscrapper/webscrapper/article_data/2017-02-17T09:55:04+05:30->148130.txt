LUCKNOW: Hosts   held their nerve to outsmart Ranchi Rays 4-0 and bounce back into contention for a semi-final spot in the   on Thursday. After the win, Wizards now have 20 points from seven matches and sit in the third spot behind Dabang Mumbai (33) and Kalinga Lancers (23).

 Seve van Ass opened the account for the home side in the 37th minute. Akashdeep Singh sealed the issue by unleashing a cracking reverse hit from the top of the circle in the last minute of the match. Akashdeep also had a say in the opening goal as he set up van Ass with an immaculate through pass and the Dutchman finished it off with a lovely touch to beat Tyler Lovell. According to   rules, a field goal is equivalent to two goals, thus the 4-0 verdict.
 
 After a lacklustre opening quarter, the game blossomed a bit as Wizards earned two short corners in the next 15 minutes. But both were muffed up by VR Raghunath. Off the first attempt,   made a goal-line save, and then Raghunath pushed the second one straight into the body of Vikramjit Singh.
 
 Surprisingly, with the dangerous exponent of penalty corners, Gonzalo Peillat, in the field, he wasn't given the chance to have a crack at the Rays. With Wizards medios Edward Ockenden and Sander Baart bottling things up for the Ranchi team forwards, the visitors were unable to custodian PR Sreejesh.
