NEW DELHI: After it lost a jawan,  , to unprovoked sniper fire from across the border, the   shelled Pakistani posts continuously through the night and destroyed two mortar positions and foiled an infiltration attempt in   sector. 

 Sources said the two Pakistani posts were destroyed in retaliation for the killing of its jawan on Wednesday. 
 
 Officials said troops observed movement of two-three people along the international border ( ) near Nikowal border outpost in Arnia sector this morning around 5:45am and challenged them. One of them was killed while another managed to flee back into Pakistani territory. 
 
 A   spokesman said two Pakistani mortar positions were “located, targeted and destroyed by BSF troopers Wednesday night only. 
 
 The coordinated precision fire of BSF troopers silenced Pakistani guns”. BSF has aggressively responded to Pakistan’s unprovoked firing causing massive damage to posts and personnel of the Pakistani Rangers earlier as well. 
 
 It ran operation Arjun on western border last year, following which Pakistani troops waved truce flags and requested BSF not to cause so much damage. 
 
 Pakistani forces regularly fire at civilians on the Indian side and jawans on patrolling duty, but for the past three years, BSF has taken an aggressive approach towards such unprovoked incidents.
