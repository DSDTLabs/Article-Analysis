VARANASI:   on Saturday trained her guns on BJP and SP-Congress, saying "gimmicks" like roadshows and Union ministers camping in Varanasi would not help her rivals in the assembly polls. 

 Attacking PM Narendra Modi, she said at a rally here that he wants to clean the whole country but his own parliamentary constituency is loaded with garbage and filth. "BJP has not taken steps to clean Maa Ganga and she will punish Modi and his party in the assembly elections," she said.
 
 Referring to the roadshows of Modi and Akhilesh-Rahul, Mayawati said, "I have been told that the crowd in both the roadshows was nothing in comparison to the crowd here. The nervousness of BJP can be gauged from the fact that it had brought people from other divisions and places like Bihar and MP to increase the strength of the crowd. In Modi's roadshow maximum people belonged to places where elections are already over. But outsiders don't help you win elections."
 
 BSP supremo took a dig at Akhilesh saying: " Babua (CM) kehta hai haathi chalta hai, ek jagah baithta hai toh baithe rehta hai. Par aise wo cycle ka kaam kam aur humara prachaar zyada kar raha hai. Aise toh SP ki bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi party ka bedapar nahi laga payengi. (CM makes comments on BSP symbol, but ends up promoting it more than SP's 'cycle'. Even his wife (Dimple) will not be able to help the SP ship)."
