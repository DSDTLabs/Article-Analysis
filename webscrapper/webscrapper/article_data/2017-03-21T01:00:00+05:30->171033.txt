PATNA: The Bihar Patrakar Pension Yojana, a pension scheme for journalists, will now be known as Bihar Patrakar Samman Yojana.

 CM   on Monday asked principal secretary (IPRD) Brajesh Mehrotra to rename the scheme and facilitate early payments under it.
 
 Interacting with a delegation of journalists, the CM, however, declined to increase the pension amount from Rs 5,000 per month for now. 
 
 As per the rules, a retired journalist having at least 20 years of working experience in Bihar and having completed 60 years of age, is entitled to get the state pension.
 
 The CM directed the officials to remove the clause which debars provident fund pensioners from getting the stateâ€™s pension. The state government accreditation for 20 years should also not be a criterion, he added.
