 "We have got a beautiful grass cover here at the Chinnaswamy. The white ball will carry through. The average score has been in the region of 180 and 200 but there was an anomaly last year. Last year the average score was in 140s. The side chasing have won all but one game in this edition so far. So, if you are chasing, slow it down. Taking the pace off the ball is the key with the slow bowlers coming in" -
