KOZHIKODE: A group of former students of Pannikkode Aided Upper Primary school has decided to offer their 'Gurudakshina' to their school for constructing a 1000 square feet stage. The plan is to help the students of the school to improve their skills in dance, music and other extracurricular activities to have a better outlook of the world.

  
 The old students of the school decided to go ahead with the project on noticing the struggles of the school in organizing cultural fests and annual days. The idea was nurtured during the old students' meet held over six months ago.
 
 
 "The teachers of the school are so happy that our old students have come up with such an initiative," said Kusumam Thomas, headmistress of the school.
 
 
 The plan is to construct a 1000 square feet stage to equip the school to host any kind of cultural extravaganza. The stage will have two green rooms, toilet facility and other amenities.
 
 
 The stage will also enable the school to host a bunch of events and participating students from other schools. The efforts of the ex-students have received applause as many aided schools are facing set back owing to   crunch.
 
 
 The construction work will be completed spending Rs 5.5 lakh. The initiative is coordinated by Alumni T K Jafar. School management led by manager C Kesavan Namboothiri and others are also extending support to the initiative.
 
 
 The foundation stone has already been laid for the stage and the construction activities will begin at the earliest.
