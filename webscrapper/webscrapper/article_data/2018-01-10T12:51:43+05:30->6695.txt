Bhopal: Energy minister   on Tuesday ruled out any possibility of power-tariff hike in the state. Talking to reporters at the state secretariat Jain said , “We have no proposal from the power companies to hike the tariff in the state. There is no discussion on the issue in the cabinet as yet and the government is also not considering the matter. As of subsidy is concerned, chief minister   will decide on the same.”

 Sources in the secretariat disclosed that discoms have in their annual tariff review filed before the MP Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) prepared a plan for 24% to 26% hike in power tariff. It was also speculated that more than 50 lakh power consumers would be affected, if the government approves the new proposal. The dicsoms have sought Rs 33,000 crore revenue to meet out their requirements.
 
 With elections round the corner, the   government will not allow any hike in power-tariff, said sources.
 
 Jain said the government has recently announced subsidy and proposed fixed tariff slabs for farmers and poor. The government is committed to helping farmers and poor caught in severe drought conditions in some regions. Any decision on announcing subsidy would be after the review of the district, he added.
 
 Instead of tariff hike, the government has decided to sanction rebate to a section of power consumers and is trying to implement fixed rate slab in some select districts ahead of assembly polls slated for November this year, sources added.
 
 For the farmers, the government has already declared a slew of subsidies. It was also stated that the government could delay recovery of dues from the peasants and the marginalised class having single point electricity connection.
