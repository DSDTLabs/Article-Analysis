LUCKNOW: As the controversy around BSP’s candidate and retired PCS officer VP Singh rages, there are two other former bureaucrats-turned   candidates who have their bit of controversy associated with the party. 

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has given tickets to three former government officers in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 Apart from Singh, who has got a ticket from Kursi assembly constituency in Barabanki, retired IAS officer Ram Bahadur will contest from Mohanlalganj seat. The third, former engineer in chief of PWD Tribhuwan Ram, will be fielded from Asgara assembly constituency of Varanasi.
 
 The controversy around Singh is that he was involved in the state guest house incident in 1995 when Mayawati was attacked after she withdrew support from  . A section of BSP supporters have written to Mayawati that Singh, then-city magistrate of Lucknow, had snapped the power supply to the guest house.
 
 Likewise, Tribhuwan Ram happens to be the former boss of public works department, the nodal agency under whose supervision grand memorials in the name Dalit icons were constructed in Lucknow and Noida during the BSP regime. Tribhuwan, who was given an extension twice during Mayawati’s rule, had successfully contested the 2012 assembly elections from Asgara. 
 
 Ram Bahadur has been a powerful bureaucrat during the previous Mayawati regime. As vice-chairman of Lucknow Development Authority, Bahadur had led an enforcement squad to bulldoze Subrata Roy’s Sahara Shehar in 2008. The 1977 batch PCS officer, promoted to IAS in 2010, retired from service in December 2015. Within months, he got the ticket a from Mayawati to contest from Mohanlalganj reserved constituency.
 
 Political experts say that bureaucrats are known to pursue their political ambitions after retirement. “The officials getting into BSP are often associated with BAMCEF, founded by BSP founder Kanshiram,” said a senior BSP functionary.
