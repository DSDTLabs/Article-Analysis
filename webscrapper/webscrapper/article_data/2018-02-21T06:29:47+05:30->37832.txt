KOLKATA: Three traders were shot at in two separate incidents on Monday and Tuesday, raising concerns over the indiscriminate use of firearms on the northern fringes of the city. No arrest has been made yet.

 On Tuesday afternoon, four youths walked into a builder’s office at Belgharia’s   and opened fire on the owner of Lokenath Builders, Gouranga   (62), and Ranjit Singh (46), owner of a brick kiln. They hurled bombs before fleeing the spot.
 
 Both the traders were rushed to a Belgharia nursing home. According to Guha’s family, local extortionists could have been involved in the shootout.
 
 In another shootout, a 50-year-old trader and a Trinamool supporter — Seikh Chandu — was seriously injured after being shot at in Barrackpore’s Sadarbazar on Monday night. The shooting reportedly occurred soon after Trinamool’s celebration of ‘Noapara assembly byelection victory in Sadarbazar.
 
 Locals claimed that a feud between two Trinamool factions could have led to the attack. They said Chandu’s rival faction leader Shibu   masterminded the attack.
 
 Jadav, known as an extortionist, had earlier been arrested for beating up some journalists.
