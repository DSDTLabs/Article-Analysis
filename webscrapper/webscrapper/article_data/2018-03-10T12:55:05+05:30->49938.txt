PUNE: Artist groups on Friday raised their voice against the sorry state of the two most popular auditoriums in the city.

 While   Sangeet Rasik Mandal opposed the rebuilding of  , members of the  , the apex body of theatre personalities, staged an agitation at the Yashwantrao Chavan   to protest against the delay in the facility’s redevelopment.
 
  “The Balgandharva auditorium has a special place in the hearts of   and theatre lovers. It should not be demolished. If the civic administration wants to incorporate new-age facilities, they should use the space lying vacant in the premises. The existing building is in good condition,” said  , president of Balgandharva Sangeet Rasik Mandal.
 
 The civic body has planned the reconstruction of the auditorium for which the standing committee has approved Rs10 crore. As per the proposal, the current building will be demolished to make way for three auditoriums. These will include a professional theatre, an experimental theatre and an open air venue.
 
 Members of the Natyaparishad said the civic administration should prioritize other ongoing projects. The construction of ‘Shivsena Pramukh Balasaheb Thackeray Kalamandir’ at Yashwantrao Chavan auditorium should be finished first rather than starting new work, they said.
 
 “Balgandharva renovation should not be taken up, when other projects are suffering for completion,” the group members said.
