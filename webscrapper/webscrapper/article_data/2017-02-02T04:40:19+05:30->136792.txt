New Delhi: The Delhi government has expressed its disappointment with the allocation for Delhi in the  . 

 Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the portfolio of finance, pointed out on twitter that Delhi’s share in central taxes has remained   for the 17th year at Rs 325 crore. 
 
 The Centre has allocated a total amount of Rs 758 crore to Delhi for 2017-18. Its share in central taxes and duties remains unchanged despite the AAP government's demand for an increase. The government has given Rs 412.99 crore as central assistance while Rs 15 crore has been allocated for paying enhanced compensation to the 1984 riot victims. The grant for Delhi Disaster Response Fund is unchanged at Rs 5 crore.
 
 In the previous budget, too, Centre had allocated Rs 758 crore but later increased the amount to Rs 818 crore in the revised estimate by raising the enhanced compensation for the Sikh riot victims from Rs 15 crore to Rs 75 crore.
 
 Later in the day, the Delhi government pointed out that “the share in central taxes of Delhi...is stagnant since 2001-02. The Government of NCT of Delhi deserves its legitimate share in central taxes to finance various developmental projects. We had requested the Government of India a number of times to enhance the allocation to at least Rs 5,000 crore as against Rs 325 crore being released to Delhi.” 
 
 To underline its disappointment, the government pointed out that the size of Delhi budget had increased from Rs 8,739 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 46,600 crore in 2016-17. “States are getting a share in central taxes every year based on the annual increase in collection of central taxes,” pointed out the statement. 
 
 The government also raised the point that the Centre had not earmarked any funds for the local bodies in Delhi although they had “requested for allocation of Rs 4,087 crore as a local bodies grant, based on Rs 488 per capita per annum derived by the 14th Central   for the award period of 2015-20.” 
 
 The statement said the Centre was providing basic and performance grants to local bodies in all states except Delhi “although we are providing 10.5% of our annual tax collection to the local bodies”. It also had an issue with the normal central assistance for 2017-18 proposed at Rs 412.99 crore, same as in 2016-17. “We had requested for this to be increased to at least Rs 1000 crore in the current year’s revised estimate and Rs 1,500 crore in the 2017-18 budget estimate,” it was stated. 
 
 The AAP government claimed it had already paid about Rs 96 crore as enhanced compensation to the 1984 riot victims in the current year. “However, in the Union Budget, an amount of Rs 75 crore in the current year’s revised estimate and Rs 15 crore in the next year’s budget estimate has been proposed for reimbursement,” it was stated.
