MUMBAI: The state government on Wednesday decided to set up a special death   to review each death that reportedly occurs due to the   virus, especially in private hospitals. The decision to set up five-member death committees in each municipal corporation follows complaints of improper treatment at  , said a senior health ministry official.

 “We keep hearing of patients kept on ventilator support for 30 days or 40 days in private hospitals. How can the H1N1 virus survive for 40 days? It will itself die in seven days,” the official said. He said ventilators were being misused in private hospitals. 
 
 Director general of health services Dr Satish Pawar said the committee would have two tasks. “It will have to assess whether the patient was given the right treatment and what is the cause of death. The committee will also check whether the hospital followed the proper guidelines before putting the patient on ventilator,” Pawar said.
 
 A meeting was called on Wednesday in view of the rising number of   cases and  . “It has been decided that patients should be started on oseltamivir, the medicine to control H1N1, at the earliest. Also, the state Food and Drug Administration has been advised to ensure adequate supply of oseltamivir,” he said.
 
 State health minister Dr Deepak Sawant, who chaired the meeting, said the state would soon start mapping dengue and malaria infections.
 
 In the legislative assembly, the government said the state reported 844 cases of swine flu between January and April. Of these, 165 patients died, said Sawant. In the city, 22 cases were detected during this period, one of which was a death.
 
 In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, 49 swine flu deaths were reported, said Sawant.
