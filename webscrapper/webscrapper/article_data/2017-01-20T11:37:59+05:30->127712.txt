KOLHAPUR: The   (RTO) Kolhapur has identified   in the district and has suggested the precautionary measures that can be implimented to reduce the number of mishaps that take place in those zones. 

 The Kolhapur district is located in the mountain ranges of Sahyadri mountains, a part of the Western Ghats. Out of the 12 talukas in the district, as many as 6 are located the in mountain ranges. There are as many as six passes which connect Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The roads are curved out in the hilly areas and these terrains are more prone to accidents that straight roads seen on plain land.
 
 The deputy regional transport officer (DRTO) Rajendra Varma said, “Our four flying squads mapped 60 accidents prone areas. We have suggested the precautionary measures to avoid accidents. We will present the reports to the   (PWD) and then to the   head by the district collector.”
 
 “We have suggested measures depending on road and areas. Suggestions range from speed breakers, road widening, safety nets on the side of the road, reflectors on trees, sign boards to building safety walls to both sides of road in ghats sections. The   road goes through forest so reflectors needs to be stuck on trees on roadside. 
 
 Some very accident prone sections are Waghbil ST stand to Sairaj Petrol pump, Borpadalegao to Shivprasad Dhaba on Kolhapur-Ratnagiri national highway. The national highway is not like other broad highways. Therefore it is vulnerable to accidents. Even road between Kolhapur to Radhnagari to Singhdurg is vulnerable due to its hilly location.
 
 The resident of the Radhanagari said, “As we located in the hilly areas, roads are not straight and plain. Even the sign boards are not in a good condition. The boards have been eroded by heavy rains and cold winters. The government should re-paint the boards. There is also a need to install road safety mirrors where roads have a sharp turn or blind corner.”
