HYDERABAD: A day after two students hailing from Jammu & Kashmir were allegedly beaten up by a group of people in Haryana’s Mahendragarh, All India   (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday accused the state government of failing to live up to its constitutional responsibility.

 Asad said that the   government has failed to provide protection to the “life and limb of the state’s people”.
 
 “I condemn the beating of the Kashmiri students. What crime have they done? Kashmir is an integral part of India and it will always be. The government is following its ideology instead of providing security to people,” he said.
 
 On Friday, a group of unidentified people assaulted two students from J&K after they left a mosque in Mahendragarh.
 
 The students have been identified as  , 23, and  , 22, of Central University, Haryana. They alleged they were followed by men on two-wheelers as they made their way back to the campus. Haryana Police lodged an FIR in connection with the incident. Three accused have been arrested.
