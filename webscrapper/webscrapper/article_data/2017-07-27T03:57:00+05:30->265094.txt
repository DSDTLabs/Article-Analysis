Nagpur: The juvenile convict in Yug Chandak murder case is now 20 and an adult. He benefited as the crime took place 2014 when he was still a minor and the new Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2015, was yet to come into force.

 A law expert explained that the juvenile was 17 years of age when he participated in the conspiracy to kidnap eight-year-old Yug Chandak for ransom. The crime was tried under Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2000.
 
 The expert said the older version provided for only three years stay in the special home even for serious offences. “The minor is now a major. The apex and high courts in several judgements had laid out it was not conducive for majors to stay in the observation home for the children. Moreover, the older version also had provision for reformatory punishments and penalties where parents could pay. This included working in community services. This was followed in the latest verdict,” said the expert.
 
 According to the expert, the new law categorizes offences as petty, serious and heinous. “Three years of imprisonment can be slapped for petty offences, upto seven years for serious and seven and more for offences bracketed as heinous. The minors, in the age group of 16 to 18 years of age can be treated as adults in offences of heinous nature, which is a reform post-Nirbhaya case,” the expert said.
 
 He stated that in case of Yug Chandak, there was substantial likelihood of the juvenile being treated as major and crime would have been categorized as heinous.
