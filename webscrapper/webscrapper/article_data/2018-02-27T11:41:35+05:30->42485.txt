PUDUCHERRY: The opposition   has sought Prime Minister   to take appropriate steps to end the 'deadlock' between the lt governor   and council of ministers of Union Territory of  . 

 In a memorandum submitted to Modi during his visit, the four AIADMK MLAs said 'hatred and disharmony prevailing between the   and council of ministers' had paralyzed the administration and the 'interest and welfare of people has become the casualty'.
 
 "Lt governor being the administrator of the Union territory behaves in a whimsical manner and she interferes in all matters. She is self-centred and publicity-oriented. She is conscious of her own popularity and in the process undermining the authority and dignity of elected representatives. In short, she behaves in an autocratic manner," they said in the joint memorandum.
