GURUGRAM: One person has been booked for allegedly cheating a   of Rs 1 lakh in a mobile   that is becoming increasingly common. 

 According to Janki Devi, a resident of DLF -3, she realised that she was   on Monday when she visited the State   of India (SBI)   on MG Road. She got to know at the bank that Rs 1 lakh was withdrawn from her account on July 6. Initially, Janki could not remember where the money was spent, but when she asked her husband, the account holder, he, too, was clueless. 
 
 After much thought, Janki remembered that she had received a   from the “branch manager” and had revealed the account details to him. When she approached the branch manager, she was informed there was no call made from the bank and she had been cheated. 
 
 She immediately approached the DLF -2 police station and filed a complaint. She told cops that she had received a call from a man posing as the branch manager of her husband’s bank branch claiming that the ATM card had been blocked. 
 
 He asked her to reveal the ATM PIN that would help him in unblocking the card. Not suspecting his motive, Janki told him the PIN and the OTP numbers she received after that. She claimed that she received the OTP numbers 13 times. The accused called her up again after a few minutes to inform her that the ATM card had been unblocked. 
 
 Satisfied, she did not even suspect for once that her savings had vanished from her account. 
 
 An FIR against the unidentified accused under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC at DLF -2 police station. A police official said they will coordinate with the cyber crime unit to investigate the fraud.
