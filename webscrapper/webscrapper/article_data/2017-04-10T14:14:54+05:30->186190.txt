NEW DELHI: J&K chief minister  's brother   today appealed to the   (EC) to postpone a key 
  scheduled for April 12.

 Tassaduq , the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the   parliamentary constituency, said he he would withdraw "if it helps to postpone the elections." The main candidates from Anantnag are   and state Congress chief G A Mir.
 
 "The present situation in the valley is not right for election. Eight civilians lost lives yesterday. You can't force people to vote and can't force them not to vote," Tassaduq said. 
 
 Opposition National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said Tassaduq's comment is a sign of the state government's failure, something the PDP's coalition partner the BJP "doesn't see". 
 
  
  The 
  was necessitated after state CM Mehbooba Mufti won the Assembly bypoll in June last after. 
 
 The bypoll in Anantnag is taking place a few months after the unrest in which nearly 90 people were killed. The four districts of south Kashmir - Anantnag, Kulgam, Pulwama and Shopian - had remained the epicentre of the last year unrest and the anger is still visible.
 
 Earlier in the day, another government school - the second in two days - was set on fire by unknown people in the Padderpora area of south Kashmir's Shopian district. The school was designated a polling booth for the bypoll for the Anantnag parliamentary seat
 
 On Sunday, in a similar poll related incident, a government school was torched by unknown persons in Pulwama's Arihal area.
