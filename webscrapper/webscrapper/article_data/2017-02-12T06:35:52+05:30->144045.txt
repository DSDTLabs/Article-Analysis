LUCKNOW: Schools should play the role of second guardian, give children a fear-free environment where they can share their problems without a hitch. These are the thoughts of  , father of Lalit, a class XII student who shot himself with his father’s licensed revolver on December 3 after being scolded in school. 

 “Teachers should find out why a child is sad, quiet or feeling threatened. Being their second guardians, they should try to divert his attention and counsel him,” said Yadav. 
 
 Yadav said his son often spoke about being humiliated in school. “Mera bachcha bahut achchha tha, it was the teacher’s terror, insensitivity and public humiliation which made him take this extreme step. I wish I had tried finding out more about the school environment. Had I known what my son was going through, I would not have lost him,” he said.
 
 “It’s my appeal to all parents to talk to their kids daily, ask them to share as much as they can as schools lack that human touch,” he said.
