BENGALURU: The city's journey to becoming a   is picking pace. Going the  , Bengaluru is all set to implement the public bicycle sharing (PBS) system, with BBMP, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) and BMRC engaging in talks with   to implement the project.

 On June 5,   launched Trin Tirn, a PBS project, in Mysuru. In the 2017-18 budget, he announced that PBS would be introduced in Bengaluru.
 
 While the cycle manufacturer will first survey the roads and identify where these lanes can come up, the BBMP will build the lanes.
 
 "Accordingly, we will mobilize funds for the project. The sharing system will work through an app which will enable locking and unlocking of the cycles at dockets, similar to how they are done in other global cities," said N Manjunath Prasad, BBMP commissioner.
 
 While DULT will guide the BBMP on the project technicalities, BMRC will provide space for docket stations.
 
 Said DULT commissioner Darpan Jain: “We have prepared the first phase of the PBS, wherein we'll implement cycling in two clusters of 20sqkm each. The project will cost around Rs 70 crore.However, this plan will have to be approved by the state government. We plan to have cycle dockets at four Metro stations in CBD areas -Cubbon Park, MG Road, Vidhana Soudha and Indiranagar -where people can swipe a card and ride a cycle.“ Asked if cycling lanes would further shrink road space, Prasad said: “The idea that our carriageways are narrow is a myth. Many cities across the world with similar road width have cycling lanes and bus rapid transit (BRT) for more than two or three lanes. For instance, Bogota in Colombia is marching towards better non-motorised transport (NMT) modes. Bengaluru can also do that to reduce congestion and pollution.“
