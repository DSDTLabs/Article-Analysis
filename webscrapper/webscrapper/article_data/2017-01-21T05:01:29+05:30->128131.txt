NEW DELHI: Acting swiftly,   (NHAI) and other highway owning agencies have rectified about a 100 stretches where fatal accidents often happen and have installed immediate   including flash lights at another 140 spots.

 The highway ministry has identified a total of 789 black spots. While the actual plan is to rectify these spots and stretches by taking corrective engineering measures the ministry had directed all agencies to immediately put warning signals to caution drivers when they approach such spots. 
 
 Ministry officials said work is in progress to install immediate cautionary signals and signage on 52 stretches. The agencies have installed   at the beginning and the end of every such stretch and even   have been laid to compel drivers to slow down.
 
 "These initiatives need less investment and field officers have been empowered to implement them quickly. Each regional officer has been asked to provide updates. This is being done in addition to rectifying black spots permanently, which is more time taking," said an official.
