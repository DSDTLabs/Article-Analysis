LUDHIANA: Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief and MLA  , who was booked for trespassing and intimidation on the complaint of Ludhiana assistant passport officer on Tuesday, landed in Australia on Wednesday.

 But immediately after landing at Melbourne airport, Bains posted a video on Facebook in which he claimed that he faced huge difficulties at New   as he was held up by the immigration authorities on baseless grounds for more than an hour. He was later let off after charges of the authorities fell flat, he added.
 
 Bains said this was happening due to his crusade against corruption in the state and central departments.
 
 Later in a press release, Bains said, “My tour of Australia will end on May 5 and as soon as I come back, I will start visiting government offices in Punjab to expose corrupt practices prevailing in the departments.”
 
 “And this is a warning to all corrupt employees and officials fleecing the innocent people that they should mend their ways and leave the path of corruption,” he added. “It is only because of rampant corruption existing in Punjab that Punjabis who have migrated abroad are not willing to come back to their homes or even make any kind of investments in Punjab,” Bains said.
 
 Sources said the employee union of ministry of external affair (MEA) has moved a demand in writing to the regional passport officer, Chandigarh, and MEA for cancelling the passport of Bains for intimidating and misbehaving with APO Ludhiana.
