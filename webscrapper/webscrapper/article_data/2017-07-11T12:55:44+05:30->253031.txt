They follow our team while they conduct the drive,” he said.
 
 The civic body has constituted six teams to tackle the cattle menace in the city. Each team is accompanied by trolleys and other equipment to carry the seized cattle. “We have roped in 125 IMC staff members. While five teams carry out the drive, one ensures the safety of others,” they said.
 
 IMC staff caught around 52 cattle from Kulkarni Ka Bhatta, over 50 were seized from the city’s outskirts.
 
 They said that they first send a team to carry out a survey to know in which areas the cattle are present. The teams then inform cow catchers who rush to the spot to catch the cattle.
