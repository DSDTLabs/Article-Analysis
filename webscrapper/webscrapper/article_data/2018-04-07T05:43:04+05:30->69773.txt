MUMBAI: Post-graduate   aspirants assigned seats in   colleges, both medical and dental, were turned down when they reached campuses in the latest round of admissions. Some candidates filed written complaints with the state government and the CET commissioner has decided to send all these grievances to the Medical Council of India. Private managements of   schools are also demanding five times the fees for management quota seats. 

  
  
 
 Most candidates said that when they approached private colleges, most of them said there were   issues that the government had not resolved and asked students and parents to wait until Monday. Some colleges informed students that they were planning to move court.
 
 “When we called up a private medical   in Pune to ask the name in which we must prepare the demand draft, we were asked to wait and call on Monday,” said a parent. Another parent from Bhayander, a basketball coach whose son was assigned admission in Terna Dental College, was asked to return for more details on Monday.
 
 “Even dental admissions are stuck,” said the parent. Unclear about the way things will unfold, many are filling up choices in other states.
 
 The CET commissioner, Anand Rayate, said: “We have received some written complaints from students and we have decided to ask the MCI to intervene. We have told the council that they have given affiliation to these postgraduate courses but colleges are not admitting students. How can we proceed with our admissions?”
 
 Private colleges are sitting tight on the matter. “We have jointly decided to not conduct admissions and medical and dental colleges cannot be run with such low fees,” said Kamal Kishore Kadam, president of the Association of Managements of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges.
