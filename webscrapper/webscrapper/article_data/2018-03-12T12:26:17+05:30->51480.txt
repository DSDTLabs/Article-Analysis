PANAJI: Working towards declaring   open defecation free under the  , the   of Panaji has asked students as well as school staff and teachers to fill in self-declaration forms.

 In the forms, the students and staff have to sign a declaration that “neither I, nor my family members go out for defecation. I declare that my family members and I use a home/use a community toilet in the neighbourhood for defecation.”
 
 In case of students from nursery to class 4, the guardian’s signature is necessary. The school has to also also assure that it has sufficient number of functional toilets for all students and staff and that all its students and their family members use a toilet at home or a community toilet for defecation. The format for declaration is in accordance with the central government protocol for a municipal body to declare its wards and the city as ‘open defecation free’. Self-help groups are also required to give declarations that all residents have access to toilets. Only once declarations are received can   pass a resolution declaring particular wards to be open defecation free. Following this, a public announcement is made inviting public objections and feedback within a 15-day timeline. If no substantial objections are received, CCP can then adopt a final resolution and communicate it to the government. tnn
