Canadian Prime Minister recently answered a question on   revealing his favourite books, which would surely make his supporters love him a tad bit more. 

 Just like former US President  ,   is a self-procalimed "massive reader". The Canadian PM took time out of his busy schedule, to answer questions on Quora on April 4. On being asked to name his five favourite books among other questions, Tredeau revealed that while he mostly reads scholarly policy works and briefing papers these days, but he has read everything written by authors  ,  , and Tad Williams.
  
 "I am a massive reader, have been all my life. I read anything, and everything, in huge quantities. These days most of what I read are scholarly policy works and briefing papers, so listing my favourite fiction is really tough. I guess starting with a few authors for whom I’ve read just about everything they’ve ever written: Stephen King, Neal Stephenson, and Tad Williams. Other recently-read novels I’ve loved: La part de l’autre by Eric-Emmanuel Schmidt, and Ready Player One by   Cline," he wrote.
  
 Meanwhile, Tredeau's other favourites include:
  
 - Non-fiction: Gardens of Democracy, by Eric Liu and Nick Hanauer; Champlain’s Dream, by David Hackett Fischer
  
 - Webcomic: xkcd.com (I have a signed Randall Monroe print of “Centrifugal Force” on my office wall.)
  
 - YouTube Channel: Nerdwriter
  
 - TV Series: The Leftovers (Season 3 is finally coming!)
 
 When a fellow Quora member asked him to post a picture to prove it was the Canadian PM himself answering all the questions, this is what Tredeau posted:
