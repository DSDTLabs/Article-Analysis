New Delhi: An income tax investigation into the audited accounts of the Aam Aadmi Party has allegedly found   in its financial statements against actual receipts of the party during 2013-14 and 2014-15. The mismatch is claimed to be to the tune of Rs 27 crore.

 The   report, sources said, has been submitted to the Election Commission. The tax department is also looking at other actions, such as withdrawal of I-T exemption of the party for the period in which the alleged discrepancies have been found. 
 
 AAP, which was launched three years ago, had reported an income of Rs 2.35 crore in 2013-14. This increased to Rs 52.44 crore in 2014-15 and to Rs 66.20 crore in 2015-16. The party became the third largest regional party in terms of donations received, just after SP and BSP. These income declarations are based on the AAP’s financial statements made before the Election Commission, according to an analysis of the Association for Democratic Reforms, an NGO working for electoral reforms.
 
  joined the ranks of other leading parties in terms of receiving contributions from unknown donors. While 57% of AAP’s donations in the last three years (2013 to 2015) have been estimated by ADR as those from unknown sources, the CPM’s share of such contribution was around 53%. In the 10 years between 2004-05 and 2014-15, all regional and national political parties had a total income of over Rs 11,000 crore, more than Rs 7,800 crore of which was collected from unknown sources for which details have not been provided to either the EC or the Income Tax department.
