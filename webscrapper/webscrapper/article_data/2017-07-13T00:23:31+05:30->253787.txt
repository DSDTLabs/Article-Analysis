Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday sought the response of the DGP on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking to take preventive/ protective measures while erecting of barricades on roads across the state. 

 The bench took up the PIL suo motu based on the news item published in The Times of India about barricades without reflectors on the roads. The PIL was filed by the registrar (judicial). According to the news item, police with a view to stop vehicles coming at a high speed, erected barricades without reflectors at multiple locations without police constables near them on all arterial roads across the state and the same often results in accidents, the registrar said. 
 
 The barricades are visible only from a small distance and results in vehicles hitting against the barricades. Police have at certain places erected several barricades without maintaining any kind of distance rule. The failure on the part of the police to provide reflectors to the barricades appear to be the cause for several road accidents. 
 
 Since the barricades without reflectors would cause serious threat to the life of the motorists, it is necessary to issue appropriate direction to the police in the larger public interest. Hence, it is necessary to issue a direction to the DGP, inspector general of police (south) and the commissioner of police of Madurai city to take preventive/ protective measures while erecting the barricades, the registrar said in the suo motu PIL.
