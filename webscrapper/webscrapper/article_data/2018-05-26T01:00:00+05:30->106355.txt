After featuring in historical shows, including ' ', ' ' and ' ,   is happy that he is getting to attempt something new — comedy. The actor will play the lead role in ' '. 

 He says, “I have always played intense characters, but with 'Aladdin', I will get to explore comedy. The action sequences will also be different from what I have done so far. Besides, playing Aladdin in itself is great, as he is a character loved by everyone, including me. Exploring the same genre for long can make work monotonous. It’s not that I didn’t enjoy working on historical shows, but I am glad that I’m getting to do something other than just that.”
 
 The show will mark Siddharth’s return to TV after two years as the lead. While many child artistes have grown up in the public eye, the young actor says that he believes in taking short breaks. “I took a break to focus on my studies, as I was in Class XII. I also participated in gymnastics at national level and won some medals. Honestly, I don’t think a break is needed if you are getting good work. Having said that, I take a small break after every show to make sure that I look fresh. If I take a break now, I would like to be launched as a hero. If I quit acting, I will pursue gymnastics, as that’s my passion,” he signs off.
