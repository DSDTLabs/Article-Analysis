NASHIK: The   (NMC) has sent notices to as many as 38 restaurants and hotels across the city that are situated on terraces and in basements. The town planning department sent a list to the encroachment department that has started issuing notices. 

 Civic chief   had assured last week that restaurants on rooftops and basements would face action by month-end. During the NMC's standing committee meeting on Saturday, the corporators came down heavily on the administration questioning about fire safety and permissions to such establishments.
 
 The fire department also started conducting a survey for fire safety norms in restaurants and hotels on terraces and basements in the wake of the   mishap last month.
 
 The fire department had said that these restaurants/bars/hotels did not seek permission from them while the town planning department said these were unauthorised. Interestingly, the town planning department did not have a list of such unauthorised eat-outs till the issue came up for discussion.
 
 The fire department already issued notices to more than 10 restaurants/hotels for lack of fire safety provision. The fire department has also started conducting a survey for fire safety norms in restaurants and hotels on terraces and basements. But considering that such eat-outs and bars are unauthorised in the first place, all the restaurants on rooftops and basements are under scanner and will face action by January-end.
 
 The town planning department has recently handed over a list of 38 restaurants/bars/hotels that are operating illegally to the encroachment department. "We have started issuing notices to these establishments asking them to remove all the unauthorised constructions. We will be issuing two notices. If they do not comply then we will demolish it," informed an NMC official.
