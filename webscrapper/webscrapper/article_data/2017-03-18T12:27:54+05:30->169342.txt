Actress   has shared a long note about what she felt towards people's obsession with her weight. 

 Taking to  , Dunham, 30, said that she loves her body and does not care what others think of her. 
 
 "I feel I've made it pretty clear over the years that I don't give even the tiniest of what anyone else feels about my body. I've gone on red carpets in couture as a size 14. I've accepted that my body is an ever changing organism, not a fixed entity - what goes up must come down and vice versa. 
 
  
  
 "I smile just as wide no matter my current size because I'm proud of what this body has seen and done and represented. Chronic illness sufferer. Body-shaming vigilante. Sexual assault survivor,"   wrote. 
 
 She continued, "Just like all of YOU. Right now I'm struggling to control my endometriosis through a healthy diet and exercise. So my weight loss isn't a triumph and it also isn't some sign I've finally given in to the voices of trolls. Because my body belongs to ME."
