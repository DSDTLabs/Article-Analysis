There are three lakh stray dogs in Bengaluru and only 173 pet dogs, according to official records. That seems a little farfetched, doesn’t it?” says  , founder of The  . To change this and get legitimate statistics of the pet population in the city, she, along with other members, are carrying out a mass registration of pet dogs in association with the   in Cubbon Park, tomorrow morning, from 9 am to 11.30 am.

 All you need to take along to register your buddy is Rs 110, vaccination records, a pre-registered online form (bit.ly/PetReg) and your four-legged wonder, of course. You will need to fill out basic information in the form such as your name, email address and phone number, your dog’s name, age and gender, his/her breed, if he/she has been neutered, if he/she has an identity tag, and if your dog has been bred or if you plan to do so in the future. Within a span of two hours, around 100 dogs will walk away with a legit BBMP license. It’s as simple as that. The team also plans to combine this with access to instant dog tags, as well as information on the new animal welfare laws that affect pet parents. Priya plans to hold such a drive once a month in   and, in time, take it to other parts of the city as well.
 
 But why is this beneficial for you and your furry pal? “As citizens, we need this because we need to have adequate statistics that correctly reflects the pet population in Bengaluru. As of now, that is 173 pet dogs. There are other benefits for the government as well; once you start licensing, breeders will have to come out of the closet as they need a separate license. Licensing is not yet mandatory, but we need to do it as responsible people. If tomorrow, suddenly a law comes into place, there will be a mad scramble. Why wait for that?” asks Priya.
