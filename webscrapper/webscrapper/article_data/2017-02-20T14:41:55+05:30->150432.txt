For those who had qualms about what would happen to the future of the recently sexually assaulted actress! Here is the answer. 
An excerpt from the speech of Director-actor Lal…
 
 “I am really upset and I cannot even now handle the pain she had when she cried calling, ‘Laletta’! When she ran into my arms and cried. I saw her panicked and worried. 
 
 We called up the police immediately. Thanks to their alertness. They were all at home soon and started the enquiry procedures. 
 By morning, her would-be too came home. With everybody's support, including him and her family, she started gaining confidence and slowly recovering. By morning, she was almost ready to face the world and to bravely speak it out. 
 
 When her fiancé too stood as a pillar of support, she told us, “Even I am asked nasty questions at the court during the trial; I am ready to face it! (sic)”
 
 Brave girl she is and lets all support her to be back soon recovering and smiling…
