HYDERABAD: The   required from the   to   for the Rs 40,000 crore   project is expected to take a month.

 Though the Telangana government has got clearances from the regional office at Chennai and the Telangana State Board for Wildlife for laying water supply pipelines for 3,000 km in reserve forest areas, the state is yet to get the green signal from the Union ministry for the crucial 800-km stretch through Kawal and Amrabad tiger reserves.
 
 With chief minister   setting December 2017 as the deadline for the project, the officials are racing against time. Chief secretary S P Singh, who has been closely monitoring the work, rushed to Delhi to impress upon the ministry the need for speedy clearances.
 
 “The file would be placed at the National Board for Wildlife meeting expected to be held next month. The last time this board met was on March 2,” a senior official in Telangana rural water supply department said.
 
 Sources said the ministry is expected to give clearance with riders such as providing water pits for wild animals en route the pipeline alignment. “As Mission Bhagiratha is a drinking water project and would quench the thirst of thousands of tribals in about 5,000 forest dwellings, it is expected that clearance will be given. The government has already agreed to give Rs 750 crore to the state for potable drinking water project, which is being utilised for Mission Bhagiratha,” said an official.
