 Kunaal, who is shooting in Kanpur for the second time and will be in the city for around a month, is looking forward to his stay here. "It is quite humid in Kanpur these days but I am happy that I am back here to shoot for this film. The last time I was here, I got to taste the best biryani and kebabs of my life. This time, since I am here for a longer period, I will explore more of the city and will treat myself to some famous dishes available in Kanpur," he said. Meanwhile, Zeishan, who plays Kunaal's friend in the film, is also loving the feel of the city. "Since I am from Wasseypur, I am finding Kanpur quite similar to my home town. Kanpur ke logon mein wahi tashan hai jaisa   ke logon mein hai," said Zeishan.
