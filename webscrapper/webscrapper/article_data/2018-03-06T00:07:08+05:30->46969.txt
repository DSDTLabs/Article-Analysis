Pune: The Pune rural police have set up an outpost at Vadhu Budruk village and will soon have a similar facility at Koregaon Bhima, off the Pune-Ahmednagar highway.

 A total of 45 police personnel will man these two outposts. The superintendent of police, Pune rural, Suvez Haque said, “We want to keep an eye on the developments to avert violence in the future. The two chowkis would be strategically located and help maintain law and order in these villages. At Vadhu, the outpost is located exactly in between the two ‘samadhis’ and police can keep an eye on both of them 24X7.” The other police outpost will come up near the Koregaon Bhima war memorial, he said.
 
 Haque said he had demanded additional manpower of 45 constables to man these two outposts. “The government will soon sanction these posts,” he said.
 
 The development comes in the wake of the January 1 violence in Koregaon Bhima and adjoining places that claimed one life and left several properties damaged. A group of men, waiving saffron flags and shouting slogans, had set off the violence near the gathering of several Dalits at the Koregaon Bhima war memorial to mark the 200th anniversary of the British-Peshwa war.
 
 Vadhu Budruk houses two ‘samadhis’ — one of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and another of Govind Gopal Gaikwad. Trouble brewed in the village in the last week of December over claims and counter-claims related to Gaikwad’s samadhi. —Gitesh Shelke
