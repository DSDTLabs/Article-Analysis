Noida: A sports-centric routine is the road to a healthy life, feels   Mirza, who was in Noida on Sunday to inaugurate a tennis academy.

 “I endorse and encourage a sports-centric living. Children of families living here would be fortunate to have a tennis academy right in the middle of their neighbourhood. I used to ride an auto-rickshaw for an hour to reach my tennis academy,” the 31-year-old tennis star said.
 
 Nursing an injury in her right knee, Sania has been out of action since October last year. Asked about her temporary break from tournaments, she said: “I’ve had surgeries before, now I’m just managing the pain. I turned professional in 2003. It’s a very demanding life away from family and loved ones. I had a pretty long career. These four months will not make a difference to my career in the larger perspective. I am taking positives out of it. But eventually, I will retire.” She added that it will take her at least two more months to get ready for action. 
 
 Sania termed “a decent one” her 2017 season, during which she managed to win just one WTA title compared to eight in 2016 and 10 the year before. Talking about the Fed Cup starting on Wednesday at Delhi Lawn Tennis Association courts, Sania said the Indian team had a tough task ahead.
 
 The multiple Grand Slam winner also endorsed the need for India to nurture a culture of sports. “Becoming a sporting nation does not mean how many champions you have, it means how many people are playing a sport. When you go to Australia or America, every kid there plays whatever it is, baseball or football. As they have so many in numbers playing, they have so many champions. It has got a lot better (in India) in the last few years,” she said.
 
 After interacting with the media, Sania hit the   for a brief session with 12 children.
