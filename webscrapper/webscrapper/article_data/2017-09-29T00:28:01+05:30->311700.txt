Chennai: The city’s water woes may continue as the onset of the northeast (NE) monsoon in Tamil Nadu is likely to be delayed this year. The NE monsoon brings the city 60% of its annual rainfall and is responsible for filling reservoirs and lakes. Normally, the NE monsoon sets in by October 15 but it has not been the case over the past five years.

 Last year, the monsoon set in over Tamil Nadu on October 28. It was in 2009 last that it set in by October 15. Weather blogger Pradeep John said, “The onset of the NE monsoon coincides with the withdrawal of the southwest (SW) monsoon over the southern peninsula.” 
 
 The IMD has declared that the southwest monsoon will completely withdraw from central parts of the country in the next few days, leaving only the southern peninsula under the monsoon. The met office has set four sets of criteria as indicators of the onset of  .
 
 Area cyclone warning centre director S Balachandran said, “We declare the onset of northeast monsoon over Tamil Nadu when the prevailing westerly winds are replaced by sustained easterly winds. Another indicator is fairly widespread rainfall over Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.” The southwest monsoon has so far withdrawn until the northwestern tip of Gujarat. The SW monsoon has to withdraw until 15 degrees north, which falls around central Karnataka. 
 
 The SW monsoon has so far proved beneficial for Tamil Nadu which has recorded 31% excess rainfall. Overall, India has recorded a 5% deficit in rainfall. Weathermen said there is more rainfall in store for the city and the rest of the state. The met has forecast moderate rainfall over the city on Friday.
 
 Pradeep John said, “Weather models indicate that there is likely to be significant rainfall during the first two weeks of October.” The maximum and minimum temperature on Friday is likely to be 33 degrees Celsius and 26 degrees Celsius respectively. No rainfall was recorded at the Nungambakkam weather station on Thursday.
