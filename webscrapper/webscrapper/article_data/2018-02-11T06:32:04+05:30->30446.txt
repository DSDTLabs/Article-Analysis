AHMEDABAD: Over the past decade, Ahmedabad’s rapidly growing vehicle numbers, which has already touched 43 lakh, has been witnessing a dearth of   space. 

 Unorganized parking in the city has already caused issues from congestion to even murders. In a recent meeting of the traffic consultative committee (TCC), cross functional groups from the engineering and enforcement from the civic body and traffic police had met to discuss larger issues especially devising a new parking   for the city.
 
 The authorities had pointed out that most establishments were flouting parking requirements that were mentioned in the general development control regulations (GDCR). The rules required that hotels, restaurants, theatres, hospitals, malls, party plot, shopping complexes and all other public places must have 50% parking space of their FSI. This has been flouted by many institutions. “Some members of the committee had suggested that repeat offenders, especially the commercial establishments not adhering to parking norms should be sealed and commercial licences withdrawn,” says a senior traffic official.
 
  
  
 Besides this the committee also emphasised that the state government should help formulate a common aggregator for taxis and autorickshaws.
 
 “This will help decongest  , bus stations and airport. This will bring transparency in fare charges and also enable private taxi/auto players to get more business,” adds the traffic official.
