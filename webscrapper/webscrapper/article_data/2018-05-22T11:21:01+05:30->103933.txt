MANGALURU: Former MLA JR Lobo registered a complaint with city police chief Vipul Kumar here on Monday, claiming that a video that purpotedly shows pro-Pakistan slogans being raised during a Congress’ victory celebration near the district office is doctored.

 
 Soon after Lobo filed the complaint with police, a delegation of   leaders submitted another petition to the Mangaluru police commissioner seeking action against   leaders under the sedition law.
 
 BJP workers sought action against Congress leaders Lobo, Samarth Bhat, Padmanabha Amin and I Ramadas Prabhu.
 
 Complainant Jaya Prashanth stated in his complaint that the Congress leaders and workers mentioned in his complaint always indulged in pro-Pakistani narratives.
 
 Samarth Bhat, the Congress worker, on whose phone the audio was captured also met the top cop.
 
 The 139 second-long video shot on Facebook Live and later deleted did the rounds on social media.
 
 The original video, remastered to highlight the purported slogan, is 80 seconds long. The person, highlighting the doctored video, repeatedly rewinds to the portion where this alleged slogan is heard.
 
 Police commissioner Kumar said no message or content – text, audio or video – that is derogatory or defamatory in nature, should be forwarded. “Forwarding it will attract punishment. Crying innocence later will not help,” he said.
