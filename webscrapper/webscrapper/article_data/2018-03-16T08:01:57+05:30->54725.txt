SRINAGAR/HYDERABAD: One of the three militants killed in an encounter with security forces in J&K’s Anantnag on Monday was identified as Muhammad   of Hyderabad, Telangana, according to the Ansar Ghazwatul Hind, the al-Qaida cell in Kashmir.
On checking, police in Hyderabad found that Taufeeq’s family had locked their official residence in   district, and had gone incommunicado a day after the militant was killed. Taufeeq’s father, Mohammed Razaq, is a technician at the Department of Atomic Energy’s heavy water plant in Manuguru.
 
 Telangana counter-intelligence sleuths then started looking for the family. Police finally discovered on Thursday evening that the slain militant’s father, Razak, had gone to his daughter’s house in Kallur town, in neighbouring Khammam district.
