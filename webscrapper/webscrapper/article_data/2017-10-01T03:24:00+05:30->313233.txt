Panaji: When rain reaches the 100-inch mark in Goa, it’s mostly considered  . But, despite a 14% deficit, the narrative this season was a critical one, as only a 47% booster surplus in September saved 2017’s  .

 The monthly deficit kept mounting, from 13% in June to 24% in July and 26% in August, but cyclonic activity and a trough towards the last week of the season produced 411.5mm of rainfall, the highest for the month. The   for the month is 280.3mm. This was the highest September rainfall since the 515.1mm in 2011.
 
 “For Goa, the monsoon was satisfactory despite a few dry spells. The deficit of 14% is within normal range,” director, IMD Panaji, M L Sahu, said. 
 
 On Dussehra day, the season ended with a total of 2,557.3mm (100.6 inches), as compared to the normal of 2,971.7 (116.9 inches). Even as many, especially farmers, had worrisome moments during several dry spells, the century mark was reached on Friday — on the season’s penultimate day.
 
 After the deluge for two successive years and a huge surplus of 21% (3,604.2mm) in 2010 and 29% (3,832.4mm) in 2011, the intensity of the rainfall has shown a decline.
 
 A 14% surplus (3,395.8mm) was recorded only in 2013 and 3% surplus (3,062.6mm) in 2014. An identical deficit of 1% was recorded in 2012 and 2016. The 2015 season ran the highest deficit of 20% during the current decade, making the 2017 season the second poorest one.
 
 The trend of increasing dry days in July and a shift in rainfall pattern towards the second half of the four-month season is being witnessed in Central India. “Goa is also indicating a similar change in pattern with increase in rainfall in August and September. But, long term studies are needed in this aspect,” Sahu said.
 
 July’s tag as the season’s wettest month appears to be under threat, rainfall during the month has been below normal six times in 2007, 2008, 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the last 11 years, since 2007.
