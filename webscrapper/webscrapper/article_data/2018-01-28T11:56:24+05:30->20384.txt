Kolkata:  , who worked with   in Mira Nair’s ‘The Namesake’, remembers the actress

 When   cast me as Ashima Ganguly in 'The Namesake', I hadn’t met Supriya Chowdhury. I was told that she would play my grandmother in the film.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 I still remember the day Mira told me that her look in 'Meghe Dhaka Tara' would be the reference for my look in her adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri’s book. Her character in Ghatak’s film was Mira’s favourite. That wavy hair, the look in general – that’s what Mira had wanted my character to have.
 
 However, I hadn’t yet watched 'Meghe Dhaka Tara' then. It was later when I was shooting for this film in New York that I saw it. The film and her portrayal of the character of Neeta left one of the strongest impressions on my mind.
 
 I first met   when I was shooting for the film in Kolkata. We just had one scene together but I remember her presence very vividly on the sets. Her voice was so full of characters. The pan that she chewed, the way she spoke and her words of wisdom… Memories of our shooting come back to my mind. I remember Mira, she and I had also clicked a photograph together. Mira had casually picked up the ‘topor’ and worn it in the shoot. It was such an endearing moment for us.
 
 Besides the dialogues, her role in the film underlined the deep connections that families have. It reminded me of her maternal grandmother with whom I have been deeply attached. Looking back, I think Supriya Devi will surely count as one of the torchbearers of independent women who have made it on their own and led a fulfilling life as well. I will remember her grace and the love and affection she showered on me.
