CHANDIGARH:   Board   on Saturday evening held a rally in Sector 40, where hundreds of residents of   flats across all sectors of CHB colonies participated on Saturday. 

 All speakers present in the rally said their campaign for settlement for all or any need-based changes in their flats will continue till all their demands are met.
 
 During the rally, the federation welcomed the administration's decision of finally regularizing the need-based changes made in the last decade within the plot area of their respective dwelling units. 
 
 The members of the federation, while speaking on the occasion, said CHB should not complicate the issue by asking CHB occupants to get certificates from architects/structural engineers for the building approval. They said they want one-time settlement for need-based changes by paying reasonable compounding fees and without any cumbersome process of taking permissions/approvals from any government-authorized bodies. 
 
 Besides that the federation also demanded that the government or administration should withdraw notices of penal charges immediately, till any satisfactory decision is arrived for one-time settlement and hearing on the showcause notices issued by CHB for cancellation should be immediately stopped and also no new notices of any kind should be issued by the board till the resolution of issue. They also demanded that administration should call a meeting of members of   Residents Welfare Federation and representatives of other resident welfare associations of the city for arriving at rates of one-time settlement.
