 Mohammed Abdul Kare em from King Koti alleged that he had to face immense trouble after medical staff refused to listen to his pleas.
 
 “The medical staff in this hospital don't care about our children. We are making rounds from one block to another with our children. My 13 month-old son is in critical condition and my wife was on the way to hospital and I had no option but to wait with my son. But they didn't like the idea. Even hospital security guards challenge us to do whatever they want. We don't come here to fight, only seek treatment,'' said  . Other attendants also made similar complaints, ruing that nurses force poor people to move to other hospitals for better care. “I had to suffer a lot to get my daughter's blood test report. Since morning around 11am to 5 pm I made rounds from the new building to old building. When I presented my daughter`s report to the concerned nurse, she kept me in waiting for hours. Is this way to treat us ?,“ asked anot her attendant Nirmala.
 
 Patients and relatives said while the government claims to provide all facilities for poor patients in hospitals, the staff need to change their mindset.
 
 The   party condemned the rude behavior on part of a section of staff and alleged that the government has failed to provide better facilities for poor people in government hospitals.
