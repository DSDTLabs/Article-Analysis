PORVORIM: The town and country planning department will scrutinize all major land conversion approvals given under Regional Plan 2021, and, if required, initiate appropriate action, said minister for town and country planning   on Wednesday.

  While acknowledging that there could be cases of misuse of the conversion process through the Regional Plan,   said that a final decision on the fate of the RP2021 could only be taken after discussion in the state legislative assembly.
 
 “If flagrant violations are observed and if these are discussed in the right forum in a democratic fashion, which is the assembly, then we can reach some decision,” Sardesai said. “Since the demand to operationalize Regional Plan 2021 came from the members of the legislative assembly, the best possible forum to decide the fate of this Regional Plan should be the legislative assembly.”
 
 The five-member committee constituted by the   department to look into allegations of land conversion and the implementation of RP 2021 met on Wednesday to study the allegations made by   at Lohia Maidan.
 
  However, representatives of Goencho Awaz didn’t show up, and, in a letter, stated that they would not provide any proof to support their claims of illegal land conversion.
 
 “They only gave a letter that they will not meet me and that the TCP board should refer to records with the department,” chief town planner   said. “We will deliberate further on this.”
 
 Sardesai did state that the board would study all major conversions that have happened under the Regional Plan, but not look specifically at politicians against whom Goencho Avaaz complained.
