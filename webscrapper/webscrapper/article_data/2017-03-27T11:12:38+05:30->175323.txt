Director Kamal’s much-talked-about   film  , the biopic of writer   aka Madhavikutty, has gone on floors in Punnayurkulam, Guruvayoor.

  Life of Josutty fame  , who was last seen in the film Moonnam Naal Njayarazhcha, plays Kamala’s friend Malathi in the movie. Jyothi, who has just joined the crew, says that Malathi is one of those naïve, good-hearted characters we get to see around.
 
 Jyothi says, “Kamal sir called me around the time when   was signed on for the film. He said over the call, ‘What I have in mind for you is a character role in Aami… Don’t know whether you would be interested.’ However, I was quite thrilled to play such an interesting character.” Malathi is an extremely beautiful girl, whom Aami (Kamala) is quite jealous of. Even in her books, Madhavikutty has written, ‘Malathi is quite fair and pretty and I wouldn’t match her beauty being dusky. I can’t help feeling jealous of her.’ Jyothi says, “Malathi was Aami’s relative — her husband Madhav Das’ cousin. However they were best friends too, and told each other everything.”
 
 Just like Manju’s traditional look, Jyothi too will be seen in beautiful saris and long hair in the film. “A big bindi, jimikki, kohl eyes… all of these are part of my makeover,” says Jyothi, who is also thrilled about sharing screen space with Manju Warrier.
 
 “When I acted in my second film God for Sale, many said that there is something about me that reminded people of Manju Warrier. It’s one of the best compliments I got in my career and that time, I had wished that if Manju chechi ever makes a comeback, I should try to work with her. And yes, that dream comes true through this movie,” she signs off.
