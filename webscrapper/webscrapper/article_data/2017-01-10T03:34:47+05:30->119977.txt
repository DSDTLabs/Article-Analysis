Mumbai: The state education department has failed to meet its key result area targets that were set by CM Devendra Fadnavis to   the quality of schools and education. 

 The department has now accelerated the Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra (PSM) programme. Against the planned improvement of 33,000 primary schools, the state managed to   only 15,000 schools. 
 
 “The PSM will now be fast- tracked and a deadline of two to four months has been set,” said Nandkumar, principal secretary, school education department. The programme has now been renamed Jalad Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra. TNN
