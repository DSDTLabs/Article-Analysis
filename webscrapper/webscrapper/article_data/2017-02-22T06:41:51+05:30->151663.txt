KOCHI: After his  ,   reflected on  's ' ' and Raul Zurita's ' ' and said that both works were at the 'heart of pain'

 "The artworks exhibited at Biennale show that language is not a barrier to convey an artist's pain. The Pyramid installation is a representation of the darkness of ignorance, which is spread across the world, and the sounds heard inside are the anguished cries of litterateurs," said Viswam, following a visit to Aspinwall House in Fort Kochi on Tuesday.
 
 He added that the 'Sea of Pain' installation casts a timely spotlight on the plight of refugees, who are displaced by humanitarian crises around the world.
 Former deputy comptroller and auditor general (CAG) Niranjan Pant deemed the works as fascinating, noting that art creations transcend time and space. "Though the whole show under the curatorial vision of Sudarshan Shetty is anchored in Kochi, it is unique and diverse," said Pant after a tour of the Biennale's primary venue.
 
 Citing the example of western classical music, he said: "A classical western music can be labelled as such if it is sustained for at least 50 years. The same is applicable in art as well. And I believe the audio-visual works and other forms of art at the Biennale are worth as much."
 
 Earlier, income tax commissioner (Kochi) A Mohan had noted that the KMB transports visitors to worlds of their imaginations. "After visiting this contemporary art festival, we feel as though we are in an imaginary world. The outstanding videos and other installations show us different cultures and different perspectives of approaching the same topic," Mohan said.
