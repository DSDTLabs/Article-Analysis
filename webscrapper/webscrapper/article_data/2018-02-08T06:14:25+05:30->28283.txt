FAZILKA:  , sister of slain gangster-turned-politician Jaswinder Singh  , joined   (SAD) in   on Wednesday. Rajdeep (43), who joined the party in the presence of Sukhbir Badal, said "It was the only party in   that works for the people from downtrodden families."

 Welcoming Rajdeep into the SAD fold, Sukhbir said she would be given due respect in the party and urged her to work for the welfare of people. She was given a 'siropa' (robe of honour) by the SAD chief during her induction in the party at their 'poll khol' rally, "which is aimed to expose the achievement of Amarinder Singh government."
 
 Rajdeep had contested last assembly election from Fazilka as an Independent candidate and secured over 38,000 votes. Her brother Rocky was booked in several cases, including murder. Rocky was killed in an alleged gang war at Parwanoo in   in 2016.
