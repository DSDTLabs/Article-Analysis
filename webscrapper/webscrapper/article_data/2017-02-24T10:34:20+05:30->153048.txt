NAGPUR: The landslide victory of BJP with its tally crossing the   went past the ambitious prediction of bookies to the extent that they are now facing substantial losses.

 It was the   who were walking back home with heavy pockets after BJP crossed the unprecedented tallies posting a heavy one-sided victory.
 
 TOI had published a report recently regarding bookies’ labelling BJP too hot for congress. Opening the bets at 76-80 at equal or par for BJP to win as many seats, the bookies went on to offer more challenging odds as the D-Day approached, especially after the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister   entered the campaign.
 
 On the eve of polling, it was reliably learnt that bookies had offered Rs5 for placing bets on BJP winning 100 and above seats. However, insiders claimed that there were not much takers which prompted bookies to lower the rate.
 
 Sources said bookies were offering odds to place on 82-84 seat share which was later increased up to 95-97. The punters, sensing a BJP wave, started placing bets on BJP’s prospects, which later turned out to be a golden duck for them. 
 
 According to an insider, bookies may have faced losses but it might not be a shocker as there were lesser amounts of bets placed due to major confusion over ward system and caste-based polling pattern. “The bookies would have faced a major setback if the amount of bets placed had been substantial,” he said.
 
 “Also, many BJP supporters had placed bets on their favourite candidates in some of the wards where localized odds were opened. Such punters too were lucky as there were no major upsets barring a few,” he added.
