Chennai: A cleaned up balance sheet, aggressive network expansion and a busy product pipeline has helped   turn around its fortunes clocking a massive 214% jump in net profits for the financial year 2016-17. The company clocked a PAT of Rs 1,223 crore for the fiscal, up from Rs 390 crore the fiscal ago (after exceptional items). For Q4, the company clocked the highest PAT in the year at Rs 476 crore against a loss of Rs 141 crore same period last year (after exceptional items), much higher than the Rs 161.7 crore clocked in Q3, Rs 294 crore in Q2 and Rs 291 in Q1. Of course the Q4 profits include Rs 324 crore tax savings from the merger of Hinduja Foundries ( ) with Ashok Leyland.

 “This is the result of a turnaround that happened from 2014. We restructured the company, our low cost network has expanded to 2678 touch points in FY17, we launched six new products which helped us gain 1.1% marketshare (over last year) to take our all India tally to 33.8% and we now have negligible debt. Including HFL’s debt we have around Rs 400 crore and our debt equity ratio is 0.1:1,” said Gopal  , CFO, Ashok Leyland. The company is offering a dividend of Rs 1.56 (156%) per share. ALL shares jumped 4.56% on the BSE to close at Rs 86.05 on Thursday.
 
 The company closed FY17 with record revenues of Rs 21,332 crore, up 7% compared to Rs 19,993 crore the fiscal before. For Q4 revenue increased 13% to Rs 7,057 crore up from Rs 6,237 crore last Q4. ALL posted 11% EBITDA margin for the year, the 9th straight quarter of double digit EBITDA performance for the company but down from 11.9% in the same period last year. “EBITDA is a tad lower than last year due to a number of factors including BS4 migration and demonitisation,” said Mahadevan. “But we have been consistently raising prices because we want to chase profitable marketshare. We have also taken a net impairment of Rs 350 crore,” he added.
 
 Ashok Leyland’s MHCV volumes grew 4% to 1,02,313 for FY 2016-17 as against 98,809 for FY 2015-16. Including exports the volumes increased 3% to 1,13,296 units. LCV volumes increased by 4% to 31,770 units. Aftermarket revenues grew 31%. Going forward the company plans around Rs 700-750 crore in capex including subsidiaries. “The spend will go into debottlenecking,” said Mahadevan. “Currently 63% of our revenue comes from domestic sales. We want to grow exports, aftermaket sales and LCV sales as a buffer against domestic MHCV volatility.”
 
 As for HFL, Vinod K Dasari, MD, Ashok Leyland said: “We are slowly turning around the operations of HFL and the company has become EBITDA positive for last six months.”
