Vijayawada: In a new twist to the Rs 40-crore land scam, daughter-in-law of freedom fighter   on Tuesday claimed that she sold a piece of land belonging to them to Maganti Babu (accused in the case) in the past.

 Kesireddy Appala Narasamma, who is the aunt of complainant Kesireddy Suresh, approached the sub-collector office and filed a complaint with the revenue divisional officer in Vijayawada. She claimed that the disputed land belonged to her husband Kesireddy Venkateswara Rao and that Suresh illegally took away the property documents from her and created a forged will with fake stamps.
 
 “My husband never wrote any will over the land. They forged the documents and filed cases against me. When I’m alive, how can he write a will, giving the property to them? Not only media, they even confused CID officials by producing fake documents and proofs,”Appala Narasamma said.
 
 As the controversy over the freedom fighter land is getting murkier by the day with the collector calling for a magisterial inquiry, the latest entry of Appala Narasamma into the scene kept investigating officers confused on the matter.
 
 Interestingly, the CID, which is looking into the case, did not record any statement from the 75-year-old, who seeks to give a clean chit to Maganti Babu. tnn
