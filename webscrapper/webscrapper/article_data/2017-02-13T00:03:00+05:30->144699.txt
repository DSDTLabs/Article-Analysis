Kolhapur: The civic body will table the proposal to develop multi-sports facility at Mangeshkar Nagar, a first-of-its-kind in the city, at the general body meeting on February 20. 

 At present the city does not have a sports auditorium where facilities for indoor games are available. The proposed facility will have boxing rings, table tennis and wrestling facilities along with other sports activities related to athletics. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to approach the ministry of sports for funds. The ministry’s schemeKhelo Indiafunds the establishment of sports infrastructure in various cities. Recently, the KMC sent a proposal to develop synthetic turf at Major Dhyanchand Hockey Stadium and sought funds of Rs 11 crore. 
 
 KMC’s city engineer Netradip Sarnobat, said, “The sports enthusiasts are demanding a facility where all the indoor games can be played. A large auditorium has been planned for the purpose. We are going to approach ‘Khelo India’ authorities to sanction the proposal.”
 
 Khelo India is also known as National Programme for Development of Sports which was formed after combining Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan, Urban Sports Infrastructure Scheme and National Sports Talent Search System Programme from 2016-17 onwards. As per the scheme, the government grants 50% to 80% of the infrastructure cost. 
 
 The GB meet is also going to decide the standing committee’s recommendation to allow only sports-related activities at Sasane Ground. The ground is used for various festivals and shows. Several political and religious programmes take place at the ground due its proximity to the central bus stand (CBS) and railway station. The locals had demanded that the ground should be used by children to play sports.
