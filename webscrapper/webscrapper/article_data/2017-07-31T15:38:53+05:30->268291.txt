NEW DELHI:   is no stranger to internet trolls and the two-time Olympian has proven time and again that she is a ‘Boss’ when it comes to shutting down those who try to create unnecessary furore to get attention by targeting celebrities on social media platforms. 

 On Saturday, a random user tried to take a dig at the Arjuna awardee’s mother   stating “Is it bcoz ur mother is from China thats y u oppose MODI everytime ?”. 
 
 
 
  
  
 Jwala has a Chinese-Indian lineage, with her mother Yelan, born in Tianjin, China marrying Kranti Gutta from Hyderabad. With Chinese incursions on Indian borders being the hot topic these days, the user tried to get leverage with his post, but Jwala is not one known to back down and shot back warning the user to think twice before he talks. 
 
  
  
 
 The user, though, was unrelenting and stated that Yelan is anti-Modi all the time even as the Prime Minister is tirelessly working for the development of the country. Avoiding to divulge herself in the discussion, Jwala reminded that bringing her parents in to this is not right, but the user kept at it asking Jwala the reason why her mother is anti-Modi. Jwala wrote back, “Firstly I've lost all respect for u!! So I don't think u will get any answer from me!! Secondly if u had any question..ask straight!!”.
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 The user went on to asked Jwala a question, which was in fact a statement, again totally unrelated to the tweet Jwala had put out. The Indian shuttler was clearly miffed and threatened to block the user and fortunately that was the end of the conversation.
