JAIPUR: The world came crashing down for 32-year-old   on Saturday morning when he woke up and saw his 28-year-old wife hanging from the ceiling of the room and his four-month-old son lying dead in a corner.

 Initial investigations found that the wife had some psychiatric disorder for nearly a year which the family was allegedly treating with the help of a person into witchcraft. No suicide note was recovered from the site.
 
 Singh, a resident of   of Jaipur district, said the sudden deaths of his wife   have broken him completely.
 
 “She was a psychiatric patient. But the family was taking the help of an ‘expert’ into witchcraft as they thought the disorder was because of the influence of a ‘spirit’,” investigating officer Hari Singh said.
 
 The incident allegedly happened between Friday night and early Saturday morning. She was sleeping in a room with her two children. Her husband slept outside the room. When his elder son—four-year-old Akshay—woke up in morning, he found his mother hanging from the ceiling and his four-month-old brother lying dead.
 
 Police said that her psychiatric condition did not improve as she was being treated by a quack.
 
 Nirma’s father, mother and her brother were called to the spot. “They have not expressed any suspicion about her in-laws on her death,” the officer said.
 
 Police are investigating the incident as a case of suicide by a psychiatric patient. They also claimed that the woman had once attempted to choke her elder son, who was saved by other family members when he cried for help.
 
 No injury marks were found on the body of the four-month-old son. The post-mortem report is awaited.
 
 Nirma married Man Singh, a photographer, six years ago. She led a happy life before she developed the psychiatric condition, sources said.
