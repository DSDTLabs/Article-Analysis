HYDERABAD: Scores of daily commuters, including many office goers, were left in the lurch on Tuesday as   ( ) cancelled six trains between   and  , owing to operational reasons. 

 Trains scheduled from Kacheguda and Nizamabad on Tuesday were terminated because of unavailability of rakes required for the services. "The journey from Kacheguda to Nizamabad or vice-versa takes around two hours. Usually, one rake shuttles between the two places almost thrice a day. We had to cancel the passenger trains with rakes not being available," a SCR official said.
 
 N Reddy, a daily commuter of the passenger train that leaves for Nizamabad at 9.50am rued, "I came to Kacehguda station as usual to take the train and to my dismay, I found from the enquiry counter that the service had been cancelled today. Going all the way to Secunderabad JBS to take a bus was the only option for me. It was not only time consuming but I also had to spend 200- 250 for an otherwise 40 ticket." 
 
 The cancellation of the three passenger services, which irked many office-goers in the city. These trains were slated from Kacheguda at 6am, 9.50am and 6.55pm. 
 
 As a consequence, the railway commuters had to depend on other modes of transport like   buses or taxi to reach Nizamabad and other places on the route such as Malkajgiri, Bolarum, Medchal, Manoharabad, Mirjapali, Akanapet, Kamareddi and Sirnapalli.
 
 Around 1,000 passengers avail of the daily three trips to Nizamabad from Kacheguda and each trip is spread over a distance of 250 km. The ticket fare is 40, less than other transport modes. Hence, it appears that SCR lost revenues worth 40,000 on a single day, by terminating the trains.
