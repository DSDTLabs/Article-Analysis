And for actress   this Uttarayan is one very special Uttarayan for her, as not only will she be celebrating the festivities with her   but with her family and friends as well. "I’m not a huge kite enthusiast, but I like to spend time with family and friends on the terrace. However, I wasn’t in Ahmedabad during Uttarayan in the last few years, due to professional commitments. This year I’ve made sure that all professional commitments are taken care of, so that I can take the weekend off and be with my loved ones."
