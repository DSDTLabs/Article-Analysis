PANAJI: Once confident of forming an   with the Congress, the Goa Forward Party’( ), now discontent with seat distribution, has set the   leadership a deadline of Monday to heed to its demands or part ways. 

 Talking to TOI, GFP’s mentor, Fatorda   Vijai Sardesai said that the party is still in talks with the Congress leadership, but only till the party candidates file their nominations. GFP has already declared its candidate for Siolim, Velim, Saligao and Fatorda and says that it has already commenced door-to-door campaigning. Congress, on the other hand, has declared Filipe Neri Rodrigues as its Velim candidate. 
 
 “The ball is now in Congress’ court. They have to decide whether they are keen to form an alliance with us or not. We gave up Navelim because the Congress president is contesting it,” Sardesai said, adding that the offer stands till January 16, which marks the 50th anniversary of the Opinion Poll on Goa’s merger with Maharashtra. 
 
 “I will be filing my nomination on January 16. I will also resign from my post as an MLA and will formally join GFP that day,” Sardesai said. 
 
 Despite the setback, sources within the party said that they are still not ruling out the alliance as currently the Congress leadership is still involved in meetings.
