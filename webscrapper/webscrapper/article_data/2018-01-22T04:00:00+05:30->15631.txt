Rajkot: The Rajkot District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum has ordered the postal department to pay an engineering student Rs 1 lakh compensation with 9% interest for its negligence that cost him a chance to take competitive exam. 

 The forum has also ordered the department to pay 22-year-old old Kishan Abhani Rs 5,000 for mental harassment. 
 
 Abhani, a resident of Race Course Park, had sent his application form for the recruitment of clerk at Ahmedabad Cantonment through speed post on March 22, 2017. 
 
 However, the application did not reach the recruiter and Abhani lost the chance to take the exam. He wrote several letters to the postal department and at the end, he got a reply saying that they had misplaced his parcel. “Sorry, your parcel is lost and you are eligible to get double amount of what you paid — Rs 116,” he was told. 
 
 However, Abhani was extremely upset. “I did not accept this reply because I had prepared for the exam and was hopeful to get the job. It was the question of my career,” he said. 
 
 Abhani sued the postal department in the consumer forum and appeared in person. 
 
 The postal department quoted section 6 of Indian Post Office Act 1898 and claimed in its defence that “in this kind of incident, court has to look only at the intention, as per the law we have approved the compensation of Rs 116.” 
 
 The district consumer forum termed this act as “deficiency in service” and considered an order of national consumer commission which said “the department continues to seek shelter under section 6 of postal act which can’t be its defence.” 
 
 The court ordered the department to pay Rs 1 lakh along with 9% interest from the date of application registered and Rs 5,000 for mental harassment and other expense to the youth.
