INDORE:   BJP president   on Thursday blamed Pakistan for the horrific rape and murder of a minor girl in Kathua and subsequent unrest in Jammu and Kashmir. "If 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans are raised in Kashmir after the rape of a child who is a daughter of Hindustan, then it must be Pakistani agents who have come here and done so in order to create differences among us," Chouhan told reporters in Khandwa, where he was fasting along with other BJP MLAs to protest the washout of Parliament proceedings. 

 Going on to explain his Pakistan logic, Chauhan said: “There is not even 1% Hindu population in Kashmir. There, the helpless Hindu cowers and cannot even open his mouth, how can he raise ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans? In Kashmir, whatever is happening, it can only be Pakistani agents.”
 
 He condemned the rape and murder, saying: “Such crime, wherever it happens, is a blot on humanity.” Rapists have no religion, he remarked.
 
 When TOI called him to ask why he thinks there’s a  , he reiterated his statement, saying: “It was Pakistan-backed militants who raped and murdered the girl. They have a motive to instigate communal sentiments and provoke Hindus and Muslims against each other.”
 
 Asked if he had any specific input from J&K to support his claim, Chauhan said: “I replied to a query raised by a television anchor. I have no input on the incident. Hindus are in minority in Jammu and Kashmir and they will not chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ after committing a crime.”
 
 Congress criticised Chauhan, pointing out that Madhya Pradesh has become the rape capital of the country under the BJP rule. State Congress president Arun Yadav said: “Every NCRB report speaks the bitter truth about MP. With his government in power for more than 14 years, and since he is the state BJP chief, Nandkumar Singh Chauhan can say if all the rapes in MP are also committed by people from Pakistan.”
