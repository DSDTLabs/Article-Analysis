VADODARA: MS University’s syndicate members on Friday cleared a proposal which it had received from Hero Youon Pvt Ltd to implement smart bicycle share project. 

 The joint venture of Hero Cycles and   had approached   with the proposal to develop a tech-based customised smart bicycle share project. 
 
 These bikes will be placed strategically in the campus. Users can subscribe to   and use the bikes as required, the proposal states.
 
 For this, the students will have to download the app. Register using student ID, select the plan, scan the QR code on bike to unlock it. 
 
 The proposal states that the bike share campus model is on execute-operate principle where the firm will take end-to-end responsibility of the project including the financial responsibility of deploying and maintaining bicycles, designing customised mobile application for the campus, deploying necessary manpower, replacement of bikes if required and customer service without any investment from the university. Currently, the firm is operating the project at   at   which it claims is India’s largest campus bicycle share with smart bicycle as 40,000 students and staff are using 500 smart bicycles.
 
 “In a large campus, students and faculties need to cover short distances at multiple stops such as from hostel or building gate to academic block, library among others and around 60% to 70% of people cover this distance by walking which takes more time and efforts,” the letter from the firm states.
