Sivakarthikeyan –   starrer   in Tamil, which is to be directed by Mohan Raja, also has   in a key role. 

 The artiste, who is back in the industry after giving birth to a baby in 2015, is shedding about 10 kg to do the role in the film.
 “I have already reduced seven kg and I am working on the rest,” says Sneha, who is not allowed to talk more about her role. The actress says that she is undergoing a strict health regimen. “It’s not about losing the weight I gained during pregnancy. The character needs to be as lean as possible to look the part, because of which the director is quite insistent about it,” she says.
 
 Sneha, who works out twice a day and has cut out carbs from her diet, is determined that she reduces three more kilos before the shoot begins. “I do cardio in the morning and weight training in the evening, both at home, as I can’t be away from my baby for long periods,” she says.
 
 The actress is also thrilled that she is teaming up with Fahadh Faasil in this film. “I am a huge fan of Fahadh and I have worked with him in the Malayalam film Pramani. We didn’t have many combinations scenes in that film, but I am looking forward to working with him in Velaikkaran,” she says.
