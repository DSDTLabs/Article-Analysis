 As a part of this programme, the team will be available at the station from 7.30pm to 11.30pm daily, during peak hours.

 On Monday, the assistance team was in place helping out the passengers. Passengers found the arrangement helpful. S Rajkumar, a passenger from Chennai appreciated the effort stating that it should be fine-tuned. “It is a good initiative but there should be a proper kiosk kind of set up with name board. As of now we are able to identify the helpdesk staff only by their uniform. Moreover, there should be more staff in helpdesk because passengers come in a hurry to board trains and if the helpdesk staff are available in each platform it will be useful,” he said. 
 
 Officials said the initiative is implemented across   and the division has launched it at Madurai Junction. Starting such set up in other stations will be decided as per instructions from the ministry, they said. Railway sources said that such set up was present during 1995 and there were in fact more staff manning the desk then. The set up vanished in time and it has been revived now. When compared to 1995, the strength of ticket inspectors has come down over the period and it will be stressful for them to handle the helpdesk if adequate staff strength is not provided.
