NEW DELHI: Are you getting calls from people offering you ‘private numbers’ on behalf of your  ? Beware!

 Delhi Police is looking for a gang of crooks that has duped several businessmen. They got wind of this crime when a businessman’s son lost Rs 12 lakh to crooks who claimed to be calling from his telecom service provider’s Mumbai head office. 
 
 The victim, Chetan, said in his complaint that he had received a call from a number ending with 4441 sometime ago and the caller had informed that the service provided was offering 300   to select customers. “I was told whenever I would call, my number would flash as ‘private number’ on the receiver’s screen,”   said.
  
  
 
 The caller supposedly told Chetan that he could buy the numbers through   and sell them off at a higher price later. The crook also claimed to have sold a number to the Mumbai police commissioner for Rs 5 lakh, and that the top cop further sold it for Rs 57 lakh. A buyback offer was also made to Chetan. 
 
 The caller offered to sell one number for Rs 4 lakh, but later settled for Rs 2 lakh. Thinking that he had made a good deal, Chetan booked three numbers for Rs 6 lakh, which he wired to the caller’s bank account. 
 
 But the crook called again and said there was some glitch due to which Chetan would have to transfer the money again. The previous amount, the caller said, would be transferred back to Chetan’s account. So Chetan transferred another Rs 6 lakh through RTGS. 
 
 Chetan was then told to wait for a few days to receive the numbers. After a few days, the crooks began to make excuses and subsequently switched off their phones. Worried, Chetan told his family about it, who then approached the police. 
 
 Investigation is on.
