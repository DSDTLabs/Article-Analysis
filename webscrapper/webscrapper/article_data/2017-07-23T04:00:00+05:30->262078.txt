Ahmedabad: Union textiles minister, Smriti Irani, encouraged traders and businesses to migrate to the new tax regime under Goods and Services Tax (GST), while addressing a discussion on ‘GST – a Tool for Inclusive Growth’, organized in Ahmedabad on Saturday. She said that the government won’t harass people who are willing to join the formal economy through GST and past transactions won’t be checked.

 Irani termed GST a great step towards transparency and added that there is no need for fear-mongering.
 
 “Past transactions won’t be checked under this system. There will be no punishment for being honest. If government agencies or officers ask anyone about past transactions or harasses anyone, direct action will be taken against them,” said Irani.
 
 “In fact, the beauty of this tax structure is that it gives money back to the businesses through input tax credit,” she added.
 
 The minister also assured several textile traders present at the seminar, that a clarification about the tax structure on textiles—right from cotton to yarn to the final product—has been given to various traders and they will not face any kind of loss in business. The minister also handed over a copy of ‘FAQ on GST in Textiles’ to various traders and trade body members who were at the seminar.
