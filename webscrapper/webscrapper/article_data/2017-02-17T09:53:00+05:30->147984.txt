CHANDIGARH: The   high court on Thursday asked the   not to employ any   against city resident Jyotsna Bhardwaj, who had been booked in December 2016 by the local police on a complaint of IGP (vigilance) Bharti Arora.

 The court has also issued notice to the additional chief secretary (home), DGP and Arora on a plea seeking directions to get the investigation of the criminal case conducted by an officer senior in rank to Bharti. The matter will now come up for hearing on March 6.
 
 Petitioner in the case, Jyotsna, who has a dispute with former Gurugram DC’s son Ajay Bhardwaj, has alleged that Bharti was trying to influence the investigation of the case registered against her. The IGP’s plaint stated that Jyotsna had created ruckus at Bharti’s residence and refused to leave despite requests by her staff.
 
 The petitioner claims that the IGP is inimical to the investigation of her dispute with Ajay, who married her secretly despite being already married. She claimed that Bharti was even shifted from Gurugram after she had tried to influence the investigation because of her friendship with Chanchal Bhardwaj, Ajay’s sister.
 
 Jyotsna informed the HC that now Bharti has been posted as IGP (vigilance) in Gurugram and has been allegedly influencing the investigation in her case. She claimed that the case against her was due to her influence.
 
 Owing to this, the petitioner has sought directions with regard to transfer of the investigation to some independent high-ranking police official, senior to Bharti. She apprehended that she might be arrested by the Gurugram police.
