SHIMLA: In a move that will give new wings to Himachal tourism, the Union government has approved   for the state under the UDAN scheme.

 Under this regional air connectivity scheme of the Union ministry of civil aviation, helicopter services would be provided at cheaper rates to people from various destinations.
 
 The services would be provided from Kasauli to Shimla; Manali to Kullu; Mandi to Dharamshala, Kullu and Shimla; Nathpa Jhakri to Rampur; Rampur to Nathpa-Jhakri and Shimla; besides Shimla to Kasauli, Mandi and Rampur.
 
 One has to pay a sum of Rs 2,500 per passenger for an hour of flight by a plane or 30- minute journey by a helicopter. As of now, 19 states have been brought under the scheme.
 
 Chief minister   said he had discussed the issue of providing air connectivity to the far-flung areas of the state with Prime Minister   during his recent visit to Delhi.
 
 He said this would certainly boost the tourism sector, besides saving journey time for tourists.
 
 “With this initiative taken by the Centre, a small state like Himachal would be catering to the needs of tourists in a better way,” he added.
 
 Education minister Suresh Bhardwaj, forest minister   and health minister Vipin Parmar said that much hype was created by previous   government over starting heli-skiing in the state, which proved to be big failure.
 
 They said a blueprint for promoting tourism in state is being prepared and road and air connectivity will play an important role in that aspect.
