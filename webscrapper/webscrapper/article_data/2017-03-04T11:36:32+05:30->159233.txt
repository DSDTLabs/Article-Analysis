Tina and Bani enact infront of Bihaan to get his memory back. They say the same things that Bihaan and Thapki used to talk about.
 
  Bihaan gets flashes of Thapki as a bride. He then gets more flashes. He sees Thapki painting on a canvas and is about to faint when Dhruv comes in and holds him.
  
  He then scolds Thapki to stay away from Bihaan.
  
  Shraddha comes in and threatens Thapki again. Thapki tells her that she is not scared of her and will do anything to save Bihaan.
