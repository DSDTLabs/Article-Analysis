Mumbai: After chasing  , the Taiwan-based electronic equipment manufacturer, for nearly two years, the state has finally said it will not pursue the company for investments. 

 After Foxconn signed an MoU with the state in 2015, offering an investment of $5 billion, CM Devendra Fadnavis had flagged it as an achievement of his government and said it would generate 50,000 direct jobs. Foxconn’s chairman Terry Gou was present when the MoU was signed. Foxconn manufactures gadgets for world’s leading electronic brands, including Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, BlackBerry and Motorola. The state had offered it 1,500 acres at Talegaon along the Pune Expressway.
 
 “Foxconn is a manufacturing firm and its decision is based on its clients. They would not share their concerns or plans with us,” said a Mantralaya source. Industry minister Subhash Desai said the government is not interested in pursuing Foxconn. “We have other foreign investors. Last year, we signed 2,984 MoUs worth Rs 8 lakh crore with a projected employment of 30 lakh. Of these, Rs 4.91 lakh crore plans have already materialised,” he said.
 
 Desai said if and when Foxconn decides to invest in the state, it would always be welcome.
