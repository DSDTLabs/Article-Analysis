LUDHIANA: The team of ICanGuide (ICG) — led by its founders Dr Surinder Gupta, Dr Inder Sharma, Dr Dharminder Kwatra, Dr Ranbir Singh, Mr  , and   data in-charge   — honoured Dr M   John, head of the Haemato-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant ( ) Unit, Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), for his support and blessings to the ICG initiative for cancer patients.

 The BMT Unit of CMCH is a pioneer in providing bone marrow transplant treatment facility in blood cancer patients. ICG is a platform where a patient suffering from cancer gets expert opinion, based on his or her condition. It is a free of cost social service, only to tell patients about the next step they need in the treatment of the disease. Patients can continue with their treatment at the nearby treatment facility, thus saving their money and time.
 
 Dr Joseph appreciated the ICG concept and the motivation behind it. He said many patients, despite having sufficient funds and curable status of the illness, fail to take the vital next step at the right time, thus losing the expected outcome of the treatment and cure for the disease.
