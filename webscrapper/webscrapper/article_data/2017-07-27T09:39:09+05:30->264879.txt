MUMBAI: A taxi driver and his accomplice allegedly took a   accountant, who had been offloaded from an Ahmedabad flight for being “too drunk”, to a dance bar in   and stole his valuables worth Rs 95,000. The police identified the cabbie, Ashraf  , after going through the footage of CCTV cameras outside the airport and arrested him on Tuesday.

 After committing the crime, Shaikh and his accomplice allegedly dumped the victim, Rakesh Parmar (40), at   in Sahar. On July 20 evening, a drunk Parmar, who was in Mumbai for a brief holiday with his friends and was returning home, was offloaded from a flight as he “could not even stand”. In the complaint, Parmar said, “Me and my three friends stayed at a Dahisar hotel for three days and partied at ladies service bars.”
 
 “Parmar was offloaded at 7.30pm. He loitered inside the airport for some time and came out around 10pm. Outside, he inquired with people if there were any dance bars nearby. Shaikh’s accomplice spotted him and offered to take him to one,” said an officer from the Sahar police station. Shaikh and his accomplice then took Parmar to a dance bar in Andheri where the victim consumed more alcohol. Around 3am the next day, a completely inebriated Parmar left the bar and got back into the cab. 
 
 “Taking advantage of Parmar’s inebriated condition, Shaikh stole his cash, gold ring and chain and dumped him,” said the police. Hunt is on for Shaikh’s accomplice.
