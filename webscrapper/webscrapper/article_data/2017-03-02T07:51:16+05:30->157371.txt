KOLKATA: Chief minister   on Wednesday asked her party leaders not to needlessly meddle in  . Making it amply clear that she will not tolerate any interference, the chief minister asked her   to forward complaints, if any, to the  . 

 “Whatever needs to be done or seen on health, I will do it. If there are any complaints, inform the administration. The party will not take anything on this in its hands,” Mamata said.
 
 According to sources, Madan Mitra’s no-holds-barred telephonic conversation with Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals’ chief executive officer Rana Dasgupta on February 24 didn’t go down well with the chief minister. The beleaguered party leader left for Puri with his family on Wednesday.
 
 In a party where every utterance by the CM is held to be cue, Mamata’s public dressing down of top executives of private hospitals risked getting misinterpreted by party workers as a carte blanche to rake up such issues. Least strong-arm tactics be repeated, Mamata made her views known in the party’s core committee – its highest decision-making body – meeting at her Kalighat residence on Wednesday.
 
 The CM, who is likely to push ahead with private healthcare reforms measure on Friday by tabling her proposals to set up a regulatory watchdog and amend the existing legal framework, has repeatedly stressed that her proposed steps are reformatory in nature and not merely punitive. She believes the proposed measures will plug the leaks that are snowballing into a pent-up public anger – and frustration – at private hospitals regularly.Mamata, sources said, is aware that generalization of the issue can be detrimental to the private healthcare industry.
 
 Her missive to her party leaders is clearly aimed to drive home her message.
