HYDERABAD: With the state government announcing a one-time grant of Rs 200 crore for   celebrations, cash-strapped varsity officials breathed a sigh of relief and said they have to prioritize their agenda to put up a grand show. 

 Officials made it clear that a major chunk of the money would be allocated for infrastructure and about 15-20 crore would be put aside to organize conferences, sports and cultural activities, setting up pandals, decorations, photography and food. 
 
 "We asked for 400 crore and planned accordingly. Now, as we got 200 crore, we need to prioritize things and see what can be accommodated. Nevertheless, with this money we can manage. This includes renovating the old building (Arts College, chemistry block) and construct new hostels for students," said Prof S Ramachandram, OU vice-chancellor. 
 
 "The budgetary allocation would give adequate impetus to   in general and to centenary celebrations in particular," he said. Besides developing infrastructure, a good amount of money would also go to go-green initiatives of the university.
 
 Commenting on quantum of money released, he said "Any amount is a big breather for the university at this stage."
