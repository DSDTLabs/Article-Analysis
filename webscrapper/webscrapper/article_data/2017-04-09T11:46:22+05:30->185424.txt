NEW DELHI: While trying to avoid confrontation with the   (CoA), the   office-bearers still want to have their way in the Special General Meeting which will be held here on Sunday. The Committee of Administrators (CoA) had issued a series of dos and don'ts for the conduct of the BCCI's Special General Meeting (SGM). The CoA wants the meeting to fall within the framework of the  's reforms.

 The board's office-bearers want to stick to the SGM's original agenda -to pick the board's representative for the   ( ) meet. However, they want to abide by the law laid down by the Supreme Court and the CoA.
 
 It is learnt that former BCCI president  's name would be discussed in SGM and the old guard won't mind going through the rigmarole to get his name cleared for the ICC meet.
