In the latest episode of America Anmayi, Adithya pretending to be Surya intervenes in the conversation of Jayanthi, Samanya and Samantha. While Sam taunts Samanya about her wedding with Surya expecting him to support her (Sam). On the contrary, Surya confirms his interest in marrying Samanya. He in turn asks his mother Jayanthi to go ahead with the wedding proceedings.

 Both Jayanthi and Samanya are overwhelmed by Surya’s decision. It is only Sam, who quickly realized, that it is Adithya. Out of concern, Sam tries to advice Samanya but she ignores Sam and inturn cautions her (Sam) to better stay out of this.
 
 Meanwhile, Sam looks for Surya but can not find him anywhere in the house. She eventually confronts Adithya pleading him to reveal the whereabouts of Surya. Adithya then conceals how he sedated Surya, refusing to disclose his (Surya) exact location though. However, Adithya offers Sam an antidote that Surya needs. He challenges Sam to find Surya and administer the antidote, failing which can lead to paralysis. Petrified Samantha takes the antidote, scouts for Surya but fails to find a trace of him.
 
 Sam again begs Adithya for a way out, in return, promising to fulfill his wish, whatever it is. Adithya then demands her to marry him instead of Surya. Clarifying it to be just for the sake of revenge but not out of love, Adithya even justifies his demand. Sam declines to fulfill Adithya’s abnormal demand. Impressed by Sam’s conviction to marry only Surya, Adithya finally hints that Surya is not in the house but outside the compound. Sam finds Surya lying in the car and just when she opens the door and tries to administer the antidote, Adithya shows up in the car and drives away with Surya’s body.
 
 Helpless Sam follows Adithya’s car. But by then Adithya has reached his destination. After a heated war of words with Sam, Adithya reveals a horrifying video of Surya wandering on the roads.
