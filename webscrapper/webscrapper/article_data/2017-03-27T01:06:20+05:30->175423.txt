NOIDA: A   competition of ten groups turned into a   on Sunday morning at DLF Mall of India as  , presented by TOI, entered the seventh week. The battle continued for almost an hour where Noida residents from different age groups shrugged off laziness and enjoyed workouts on energetic Bollywood and Punjabi numbers.

 The winner of the Zumba battle was 'Sharda and team', a group of three girls who won the acknowledgement for their perfectly coordinated steps and high energy levels. This was the fourth edition of the competition. Several   enthusiasts from Delhi also participated in the event. 
 
 “We came here to participate in the Zumba sessions. Although I was late, I got to see some amazing performances. I hope I would be able to come a bit early next week,” said Babita Kandpal, a student and resident of Mayur Vihar. She was attending the event with six other friends from Delhi. 
 
 A special performance by Megha Saini, a dance instructor who has performed at multiple Bollywood award shows, prompted many non-dancers to groove to the latest chartbusters. “I danced my heart out as Saini set the stage on fire,” said Anamika Arora, a participant.
 
  Meanwhile, regular sports sessions for football, cycling and badminton enthusiasts were also organised at the event, which is an initiative of Noida Authority and Noida Police. 
 
 Anand Manocha, another participant, recalled being a regular participant at the Happy Streets last year, which was organised at the GIP Mall. “Attending such fitness sessions is a great start to Sunday morning,” he said. Disha Shah, a working mother from Noida, echoed Anand’s sentiments. “These sessions are so refreshing that I feel all charged up to kickstart another week. Usually, it’s not possible to enjoy a range of outdoor activities at one place,” she said.
