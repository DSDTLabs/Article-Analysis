Bathinda: After 90 days of continuous agitation, contractual workers of Guru Nanak Dev thermal plant (GNDTP) ended their sit-in outside the Bathinda district administrative complex as they were handed over a written assurance of being employed at the thermal plant and Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) sub-stations. Punjab Ex-Servicemen Corporation (PESCO) will make arrangements for their absorption.

 PSPCL gave a written assurance to adjust all 635 workers at salaries of Rs 500 per month more than what they were getting when the government decided to shut down GNDTP on January 1. As per the agreement, 184 workers would be made to join the thermal plant and rest at sub-stations and sub-divisions of PSPCL before April 22. The deal was clinched on Friday late evening after lengthy talks between PSPCL management and contractual workers.
 
 GNDTP contractual workers, supported by a unions of farmers, farm labourers and regular employees, after getting the written agreement, held a victory rally before ending their protest. Meanwhile, the district administration heaved a sigh of relief with the ending of continuous protest.
 
 PSPCL general manager V K Garg said, “Though the contractual workers were employed by contractors and PSPCL had nothing to do with them but keeping in mind the welfare of the workers, the management has decided to adjust them through PESCO at enhanced wages. All the workers will be posted within 40 kilometres of Bathinda at sub-stations and sub-divisions in West Zone, apart from thermal plant. If the PESCO leaves outsourcing and any other companies take over, even then these employees will be kept on jobs.”
