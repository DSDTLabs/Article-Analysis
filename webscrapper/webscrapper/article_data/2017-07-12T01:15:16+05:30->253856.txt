Mumbai: Nearly 250 hectares of forest land in   has been handed over to   for the Rs 15,000 crore Navi Mumbai  , giving a new boost to the project as now, the developers can start land-filling activities.

 To avoid the flooding in the 2,268 hectares of project area, it has been proposed to fill the land to bring it 5-6m above sea level. The land will be filled with debris from hillocks that are being flattened for the project. 
 
 A part of the land that has been handed over to Cidco is along the coast with 108.607 hectares being covered with mangroves and 141.4565 hectare reserved forest land. The revenue and forest department on Tuesday issued a government resolution. This forest land falls in the   belt of Panvel taluka, which constitutes 12 villages. 
 
 Cidco joint MD Prajakta Lavangare Verma said the agency had paid Rs 35 crore for the land to the forest department. “The department has now directed us to publish advertisement regarding Cidco’s ownership and change land records accordingly,” she said. Cidco chief spokesperson Mohan   said against the use of the forest land, the agency will create a mangrove park in Waghivali village by planting almost three times the mangroves to be acquired. 
 
 Environmentalist D Stalin said, “While on paper it is mentioned as 108 hectares of mangroves cleared for the airport, a lot more mangroves which do not fall under forest zone are also going to be destroyed.”
 
 Activist   said: “The hill in Ulwe will be cut and the diversion of Gadhi river changed. Such ecological makeover is not good for the environment. There could be waterlogging after the project is ready.”
 
 However, Ninawe reiterated: “We had called experts to study and research the environment impact assessment and they have come up with a report stating it will not cause waterlogging.”
