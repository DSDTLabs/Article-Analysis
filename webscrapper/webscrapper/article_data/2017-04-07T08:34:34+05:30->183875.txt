THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM politburo member   has demanded stern action against the police officers who had misbehaved with the mother of   in front of the police headquarters on Wednesday. In a strongly worded Facebook post, Baby said the perpetrators of the assault were unaware of the police policy of the LDF. “Comrade Pinarayi himself has said that this is not the policy of the government towards protests,“ Baby noted.

 The open criticism by Baby is a reflection of growing dissent among senior party leaders over the way chief minister   is handling the police. Many leaders feel that merely putting the responsibility for crisis mismanagement on the police is unfair as the same force had behaved much better during the tenure of   as the home minister in 2006-11.
 
 Baby also questioned the argument that there should not be any protest in front of the police HQ. “Marchs and protests in front of police stations are common in Kerala. If one can protest in front of police stations, what is the logic in preventing protests in front of the police chief 's office,“ he asked.
 
 The criticism of Baby hasn't gone down well with Vijayan. He refused to comment on the matter in Malappuram and told reporters to consult Baby to find out what kind of arrogance the police had shown. The CPI, which is terribly upset over Wednesday's incident, is gearing up to take up the issue seriously after the Malappuram bypoll. CPI state secretary   continued his criticism against the police on Thursday too and said a little diplomacy by the police would have saved the day .He is likely to discuss the issue with Kodiyeri first and wait for the CPM's response before taking up the issue in the LDF.
