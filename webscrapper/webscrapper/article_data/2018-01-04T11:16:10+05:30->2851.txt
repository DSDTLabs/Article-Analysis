MUMBAI: Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh leader   said that barring a few incidents in the city where TV journalists were heckled by the crowd, the protests on Wednesday were largely peaceful.

 
 “If action is not initiated against those behind the Pune violence, I cannot guarantee peace in the future,” said Ambedkar. “There are 250 organisations that backed us in the bandh on Wednesday; I will not be able to control the anger within the community if action is not initiated.”
 
 
 Ambedkar congratulated his supporters on holding a “peaceful protest” despite emotions and anger running high among them over the Koregaon Bhima violence. “The   while hearing the Mumbai blast case has said that even if   was not present at the incident site, he knew of conspiracy. Similarly these two (  and Ekbote), even if not in Pune, knew of the plan and were inciting the mob,” said Ambedkar.
 
 
 While   runs the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, Ekbote is from the ‘Samast Hindu Aghadi’. Ambedkar demanded that the two be charged under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.“There are several right-wing organizations in the state that are creating a social divide and fuelling communal tension in the state. It’s for the people to decide whether they need this kind of atmosphere in the state or want change,” said Ambedkar.
 
 
 He said that besides Dalits, many marginalized communities supported the bandh on Wednesday because their contributions to the state were being questioned by those in power.
