NEW DELHI: The   of Delhi Police has   a   of   who were   people by offering to help them   their   insurance policy money. Three people, including the mastermind, have been arrested. 

 DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh said the accused had been identified as Dushyant (25), Swetraj Jha (26) and Shiv Narayan Singh (30), all residents of Ghaziabad. 
 
 The gang came on the radar of cops after a senior citizen from Pitampura complained that he had been cheated of Rs 68 lakh on the pretext of providing hefty bonus on his lapsed policy. The businessman said that in September 2016, one Mounts Club Pvt Ltd called to tell him that his life   company had invested Rs 30,000 of his lapsed policy in a foreign agency through it and the amount had increased to Rs 16.5 lakh. “They had even couriered coloured photocopies of fake cheques of Rs 9 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh,” an officer said.
 
 After the victim was asked to pay Rs 4 lakh as the processing fee, more demands were met, claiming the profit was increasing. They even called him posing as senior officials of the Punjab finance ministry.
 
 They said if he didn’t quickly get the dividends transferred, the income-tax department would seize it, an investigating officer said, adding that similar cases have been reported from another state.
 
 Cops came across 32 bank accounts opened using fake IDs and 34 fake government IDs. The mobile phone numbers used to contact the victims were used to trace the accused in Ghaziabad. “A team led by ACP Aditya Gautam and inspector Sunil Jain arrested them,” Singh said. 
 
 Dushyant, an MCom, had worked as a team leader in a Noida call centre before starting the gang with his friend Singh who had collected information on lapsed policies while working with insurance companies.
