 Several academicians and   (NSUI) had protested against the Bill when it was being introduced in the assembly. However, there was silence from all quarters when the Bill was passed and approved by the Governor. But the issue was raised in the senate meeting by Congress member Narendra Rawat.
 
 “With this Bill, the autonomy of the university will go away and university will not be able to give any statutes … all economic decisions will be taken by a committee,” he said. Rawat added that the senate should be called if necessary and a committee should be formed to whom everybody can contribute in regard to the act.In response to Rawat, senate member   said that Gujarat was not the first state to make this law. “The then Congress government in centre in 2013 had made it mandatory for all states to make this law and if the state government would not have made it, all grants from central government would have stopped,” said Inamdar. 
 
 The ruling group members intervened Rawat several times after which the meeting again became chaotic. Alleging that the ruling group members are not allowing him to speak, Rawat walked out of the meeting.
