GANDHINAGAR: MLAs of the   party, who were suspended for the first session of Thursday over their protests against the delay in tabling the M B Shah commission report, in the second session were suspended after they protested against what they termed a “political speech” by   national president and  .

 The Congress leaders earlier had to clarify that they were not against the speaker. The Congress members in the first session raised a ruckus after Gova Rabari was not allowed to put forth a question during question hour. They were then suspended for the rest of the session. 
 
 In the second session, after Shah spoke, Shankersinh   demanded an apology from him. In question hour, Vaghela raised a point of order and said,“Allowing any member of the house, even if he is the president of a national political party, to give such political speeches or name leaders who are not in house, is not acceptable. The member Shah has carried out an encounter of the democracy in the house.” No sooner had Vaghela demanded the apology, than the BJP MLAs and minister got to their feet and started shouting slogans against the Congress. The Congress then raised slogans against the BJP. This was the third day of the session that the Congress raised the MB Shah commission and demanded that the government table the report . When the BJP refused to give a specific deadline, the Congress raised banners after which they were suspended.
