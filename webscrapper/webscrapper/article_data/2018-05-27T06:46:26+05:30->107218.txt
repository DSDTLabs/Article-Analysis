MAPUSA: The   ( ) could be the first among the state’s 13 municipalities and one municipal corporation to operate a   station. Sources said a petroleum company has approached urban development minister Francis D’Souza with a proposal to set up fuel stations in municipal limits across the state that would be operated by the civic bodies themselves. The proposal is expected to be forwarded to all municipalities through the directorate of municipal administration. 

 If all goes well, the MMC plans on setting up the fuel pump on land belonging to it near the   public garden, along the slope leading to St Xavier’s College. The venture will be aimed at opening up new avenues for revenue generation besides providing employment, eliminating malpractices and providing good quality fuel. 
 
 “We are ready to accept the proposal as we have identified 3-4 plots of land that would be suitable for such a project. We would like to be the first civic body in the state to embark on an initiative like this, which is in the interest of civilians and the municipality,” MMC chairperson  , said. 
 
 The plots being considered for the project have been unutilised so far, Kavlekar said, and are under constant threat of encroachment and being clandestinely used as garbage dumps. 
 
 Sources said that as per the proposal, civic bodies would have to provide 100sqm of land for the fuel station and permit the staff to be trained by the petroleum company. The pump at Mapusa is also likely to sport a supermarket, Kavlekar said.
