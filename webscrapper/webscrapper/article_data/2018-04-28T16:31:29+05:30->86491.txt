 Hassanandani, one of the popular actors of Indian television, says unlike Hollywood, TV actors are not valued much by the film industry in India.

 
 Anita made her debut with "Kabhii Sautan Kabhii Sahelii" and went to appears in shows such as "Kkavyanjali" and "Kasamh Se".
 
 "I believe TV actors are very talented, the kind of pressure they face while doing television is immense. If you have done TV, then you can do films easily. I don't think film industry values small screen actors as much as Hollywood does. I wish they looked up to them, valued them because TV has some really amazing talent," Anita said.
 
 A number of TV actors entered the film industry such as Sushant Singh Rajput, Ronit Roy, Ram Kapoor, Sakshi Tanwar, Rajeev Khandelwal and others, but not all of them have been successful.
 
 "I come from a simple family and had no connections in the film and TV industry. And today when I look back, I feel I have achieved so much. I am content," she said.
