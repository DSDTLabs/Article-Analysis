Bathinda: Twenty-seven days after four members of a family went missing from   village in Muktsar on March 3, their bodies were fished out of the Rajasthan feeder canal, along with the car in which they left home, on Friday.

 While the body of commission agent Mahavir (35) was found near a bridge at Theri village, near Gidderbaha, Muktsar, the bodies of his wife Sukhdeep Kaur (30), son Lovinder Singh (7) and mother Baljit Kaur were found in the Maruti Suzuki Alto car in which they were travelling. 
 
 Police suspect Mahavir had gotten so upset after a tiff with his wife that he drove the car into the canal. However, they are working on all theories at present. At the time the four had left, Mahavir had told his father, Darbara Singh, that he was going to buy medicines for his wife, who had gotten injured after falling on the floor. They did not return. After waiting for long, Darbara submitted a complaint at Kabarwala police station on the same day, and a case was registered. 
 
 Sources in police said Mahavir had quarrelled with his wife a day before the incident and could have intentionally driven the car into the canal. “Divers had earlier made a lot of efforts to trace the body, but without any success. On Friday, people spotted a car floating in the canal at Theri, nearly 20km from Sarawan Bodla. They informed the police. We then brought a machine to pull the car out. We found the two women and the child in the car, while the body of Mahavir was found a little away, near the bridge. Relatives identified the bodies,” Muktsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sushil Kumar said. Villagers said Mahavir was not on good terms with his wife and it seemed he took the extreme step after getting depressed. Muktsar SSP said they were still investigating into the case from all angles and would send the bodies for a postmortem.
