PILIBHIT: Some   farmer families of Uttar Pradesh are awaiting Allahabad High Court’s verdict regarding payment of interest to the tune of nearly Rs 2,100 crore due to a delay in getting their cane price in 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. The high court had reserved its decision in the matter on December 13, 2016 after conducting final hearing in a slew of writ petitions filed by petitioner VM Singh on behalf of Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangathan. The decision is expected to be delivered before January 26.
 
  According to petitioner V M Singh, the provisions of UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 and Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 relate to levy of interest applicable to sugar mills in case the cane price is not paid to farmers within 14 days from the date of physical supply of produce to mills. However, these provisions were made ineffective by state government which decided to waive this interest to be paid by mill owners. The government had claimed this was being done to ensure that mills continued to function, and long term interest of farmers were protected.
  
  While talking with TOI on phone, Singh said due to the state government’s waiver, sugar mills were freed from their liability to pay interest to   for crushing year 2012-13 and 2013-14 on May 19, 2015 and for crushing year 2014-15 in October 2016. The amount of this interest added up to nearly Rs 2,100 crore, he added.
  
  As his two petitions were already pending with HC for decision on cane pricing as well as rights of cane growers, Singh challenged the interest waiver decision of the state government by filing an amendment application in the HC in August, 2016.
  
  In this application, it was argued that the farmers had been forced to seek loans from banks to meet their financial requirements in cases of untimely payment of their cane price from sugar mills. As they were made to pay interest on respective loans at assigned rate, they had full right of getting interest on their held up or delayed sugarcane payments at the rate of 15% per annum in accordance with the provisions of Sugarcane Control Order, Singh explained.
  
  The petitioner said HC was to decide the powers of the state government to waive interest and was likely to deliver a judgment soon.
