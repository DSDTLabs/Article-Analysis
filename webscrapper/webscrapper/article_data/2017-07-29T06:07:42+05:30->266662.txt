AHMEDABAD: On Thursday night, two things took place nearly simultaneously —   found a body near a small seasonal stream at Gajan village and Ahmedabad crime branch interrogated suspects in an abduction case, who confessed that the victim was dead and his body had been dumped by a road. The dots were connected early on Friday, when the victim was identified as Navin Shah, 69, the director of printing for Navneet Education, who had gone missing on Tuesday afternoon.

 J K Bhatt, JCP (crime), on Friday told mediapersons a tale of greed, revenge and an accident. Seven teams led by DCP Deepan Bhadran and ACP Rajdeepsinh Zala, began probing the angle that someone known to Shah was involved. 
 
 “Someone had called Shah two days earlier, claiming to have information about a labour issue at Navneet. Shah went to meet the person at a restaurant on SG Road at noon on July 25. He didn’t return and his driver reported him missing,” said Bhatt.
 
 It was later found that Shah had been lured into a trap by Jignesh Bhavsar, a resident of Ghatlodia, who had a labour contract with Navneet press for 12 years but his contract was cancelled four years ago. A driver now, Bhavsar contacted Shailesh Patel, a resident of Prantij, a known criminal with the prospect of kidnapping Shah for a Rs 5 crore ransom.
 
 “Patel and four others took Shah in an SUV from the restaurant, telling him that a source was waiting near the Narmada canal. In about 15 minutes, the group overpowered Shah. While trying to silence him, he was smothered and this resulted in his death. The group then abandoned the plan to demand the ransom and took the body to the Malpur-Meghraj road to dump it,” said Bhatt.
