NEW DELHI: After the 2-1 defeat in the Test series against South Africa, in which lack of proper preparation affected the team’s performance, the   (BCCI) is keen to avoid repeating those mistakes. Besides reaching England 10 days in advance,   is also working on a schedule to start its team’s preparations from the first week of June itself for the July 3 to September 11 tour.

 
 BCCI sources said a few Test specialists could be encouraged to play in the Rahul Dravid-coached India-A team’s tour of England before the senior team begins its five-match Test series from August 1 onwards. It is learnt that the Men in Blue will start the series with the T20Is and ODIs so that they get enough match practice for Tests.
 
 Sources said the Indian team management and CoA chairman   recently discussed the outcome of the Test series and it was mutually agreed that more Indians cricketers should be encouraged to spend time in the County Championship or play India A matches before the series begins.
 
 “One thing is certain. If the Indian team had spent at least 10 days in South Africa before the first Test, it would have made a lot of difference to the end result. The team is determined that each player gets enough time and exposure in England before the actual series begins,” a top board official told TOI on Saturday.
 
 “The idea is to park more and more players in England and ensure that the cricketers are ready for the entire series. With England also scheduled to host the 50-over World Cup next year, this tour is very important for us,” the official explained. 
 
 There is also talk of fielding a second-string Indian Test team, and even resting Test captain  , for the inaugural Test match against Afghanistan from June 14 to 18 to keep the focus for the England series intact. It is understood that the team management and BCCI would have another round of discussion before finalizing the players’ schedule for the England tour.
