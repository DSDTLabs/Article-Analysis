LUCKNOW: Stepping up its efforts to keep the city clean, Sitapur’s district administration launched a  ,  , on Friday. Developed by the  , the Android app has been linked to 11 local bodies and 30 wards of the city. 

 Technical director of NIC’s Sitapur unit, AP Singh, said, “The app was conceptualised in October but it could not be launched due to elections. Its trial run began after March 11 and it was launched on March 20.” 
 
 The app allows a user to locate a nearby municipal dustbin, contact a ‘safai nayak’ to collect garbage, request for emptying full municipal dustbins and submit GPS-tagged garbage pictures to intimate authorities . The user can also view the status of their requests. 
 
 District magistrate Amrit Tripathi said, “Public support is must to keep the city clean. The administration has also launched a ‘safai jagrukta’ campaign, wherein, officials will visit each ward in the morning to sensitise people about the Swachh Bharat Mission.”
 
 “The app’s conceptualisation was based on technology’s role in bridging gaps between the public and systems. Though only a few people have downloaded the app, I am sure it will be a success, considering the increasing popularity of smartphones,” he said. 
 
 The app allows the administration to monitor whether requests made by a user were attended to or not. 
 
 “Each complaint is geo-tagged so tracking requests would be easy. Whenever a user submits request, an SMS would be sent to the safai nayak of the area and a copy will go to the monitoring agency. Updates on progress are also sent to all the three parties,” said Tripathi.
