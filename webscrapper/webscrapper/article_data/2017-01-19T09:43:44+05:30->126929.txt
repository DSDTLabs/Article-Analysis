GUWAHATI: Putting to rest speculation on the fate of its centenary session, the   on Wednesday said it would be held in   from February 8 to 12. 

 Vice-president of the Sabha, Prahlad Chandra Tasa, will preside over the centenary session as president (in charge).
 
 Though the Sabha had earlier proposed inclusion of names of the vice-chancellors (VCs) of three state universities in the presidents' panel, the three academicians have decided to serve the literary body only as advisers.
 
 "We discussed the proposal of the Sabha but decided that becoming part of the presidents' panel would not be right considering the tradition of the literary body," said Gauhati University VC Mridul Hazarika, one of the three VCs whose names were suggested for the panel.
 
 The other two VCs who will now act as advisers of the apex literary body of the state are   (Kumar Bhaskar Varma Sanskrit and Ancient Studies University) and   ((Krishna Kanta Handiqui State Open University). 
 
 With only a few days left for the all-important centenary session, the VCs will guide the Sabha in the absence of a permanent president.
 
 Deka urged the people of the state to ensure the grand success of the centenary session. He also appealed to all to keep aside the controversies that have rocked the Sabha in the past couple of weeks.
 
 The crisis took on an acute form after the reception committee of the centenary session prohibited the then secretary general Paramananda Rajbongshi from joining the celebrations at Sivasagar. Rajbongshi resigned from his post a few days later, as did Sabha president and renowned author  .
 
 The quick exits of its top officials left the organization rudderless and caused great causing among stakeholders.
