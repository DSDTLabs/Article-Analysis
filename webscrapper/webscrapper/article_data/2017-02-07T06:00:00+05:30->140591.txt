KOLKATA: Every time mayor   drives down the   stretch on E M Bypass, he looks wistfully at the grassland to the east and conjures up visions of a   that has elements of the   in Singapore and Safari World in Bangkok. Catch his eye at this moment and the twinkle is unmistakable.

 Though the ambitious project is still in an initial stage with a consultancy firm drawing up the project report, Chatterjee is sure the 300-acre park will emerge as a showpiece of Kolkata.
 
 While the mayor pursues his dream, officials in the   conservancy department are spending anxious days over overflowing garbage at the dumpyard. At 3,500 tonne of solid waste per day, more than 12.5 lakh tonne of garbage has been dumped at   till date. Dhapa, the designated ground for dumping Kolkata's solid municipal waste, is already beyond its carrying capacity. There is an additional patch of land next to it. But Chatterjee has zeroed in on the very plot for the project.
 
 “There is an urgent need to find an alternative dumpsite,” said an engineer. KMC had, in fact, begun a frantic search for an alternative but it has not borne fruit.
 
 Ecologist   wondered how the KMC boss could afford being per-occupied with an amusement park on 300acre of KMC land within the Ramsar site when the civic body was hard-pressed to solve a more pressing problem that required land. “I wonder which project is more essential: constructing a park or gifting the citizens a scientifically developed and managed dumping ground?” Ghosh asked. 
 
 A section of the KMC waste management department officials share Ghosh’s concern. “We need land for setting up an alternative dumpyard as fast as we can. Unless that is done, we cannot borrow additional funds from ADB for modernizing the solid waste management system,” a KMC official said. 
 
 Chatterjee though, is unfazed by the criticism. He considers the park a people's project. “It will be something that the entire country will want to experience,” said the mayor.
