PATNA: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the   exam paper leak scam claims to have got important evidences from the house of former commission chairman Sudhir Kumar’s in-laws at   in Jharkhand.

 The SIT team searched the house on Saturday for several hours after getting a warrant for that from a Patna court. 
 
 Kumar, along with his brother  , sister-in-law Manju Devi, nephew Ashish Kumar and his friend Sajjad and commission’s IT manager   were arrested on February 24 from different locations in Patna.
 
 When contacted on Sunday, SSP (Patna)  , who is heading the SIT, said some important evidences were found during the search at Hazaribagh. 
 
 However, he did not reveal any further. The search was conducted because Ashish was provided the question booklets and answer keys there on January 23, six days before the Intermediate-level competitive exams for clerical posts commenced.
 
 “The evidences gathered by the search team cannot be revealed at present,” the SSP said adding that some forensic reports on handwriting and fingers prints were awaited.
 
 The SSP also revealed that the commission’s IT manager would be taken on police remand for interrogation. “Police would move the court to pray for his police remand on Monday,” he said.
 
 Sources also said the SIT, armed with a search warrant, had seized some more files kept in the three cupboards inside Kumar’s room in the   office four days back. The SIT is yet to arrest Anand Barar, the Delhi-based BSSC evaluator, who is evading arrest.
