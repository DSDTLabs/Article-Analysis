LUCKNOW:   on Sunday accused the opposition parties including BJP, SP and Congress of being in collusion to transfer votes to each other and stop her party from coming to power in UP. 

 "Only BSP, not a SP-Congress combine, which was capable of stopping the saffron party from coming to power in UP in 2017 and them dampening BJP's prospects in 2019 Lok Sabha elections," Mayawati said while addressing a press conference on her 61st birthday.
 
 Mayawati said that the opposition was making efforts to ensure that BSP gets restricted to her core Dalit vote base and no other community gets associated with her party. She peculiarly slammed the BJP of deliberately targetting her and her familty members (read her brother Anand Kumar) over money deposited in bank accounts. Mayawati said that all this showed the deperation of BJP to malign her with a political agenda. But such allegations, she claimed, would only help her party to grow stronger and emerge victorious in the forth coming assembly election.
 
 The BSP boss said that while she was being targetted, many other big politicians were spared by the BJP government.
  
 She also attacked the BJP dispensation of running schemes on the agenda of RSS and then linking them with nationalism to prevent it from facing criticism. "In fact, the schemes like demonetisation was brought in to facilitate those close to BJP," Mayawati charged. 
 
 She also accused the BJP of using the money power to manage opinion polls and divert people's attentions from its failure. "BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should understand that they can only manage opinion polls but not the actual result in poll bound states," she said, adding that Janta will usher in `Burey Din' for BJP just like in Bihar. "People will also not fall in the trap of the BJP through its forthcoming union budget," she said.
