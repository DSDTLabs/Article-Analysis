PUNE:   with scant regard for   and  . This is how over 700   ushered in the  . 

 As per police data, cases of driving under the influence of alcohol soared by 62% this New Year when compared to 2015. As many as 573 motorists were booked for drunk driving during the New Year celebrations on Saturday as against 353 on December 31, 2015, the data stated.
 
 Police also collected fines worth Rs 37,200 from 186 two-wheeler riders for riding triple seat and booked 12 drivers for rash driving on Saturday. "However, no accidents were reported from the city roads or the highways," police said.
 
 "Police had planned an intensive check against drunk driving at various locations across the city, particularly on major thoroughfares prone to over-speeding and rash driving. The rise in these offences can be attributed to our enhanced vigil," Pravin Mundhe, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), told TOI on Sunday.
 
 A person is said to have committed a drunk driving offence when a breath analyser test conducted on him on the spot reveals minimum 30mg of alcohol content in his body. "The action against errant motorists was initiated at 9pm on Saturday and continued till the wee hours of Sunday. The motive was to ensure accident-free celebrations on the city roads," Mundhe said.
