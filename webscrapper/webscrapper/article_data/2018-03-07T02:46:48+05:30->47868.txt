NEW DELHI: The   would soon have a unique   SWAT squad. 

 The police department has made the squad after selecting women who were already part of the constabulary and had undergone commando training. The selected women will now be given SWAT training. The squad has considerable participation from the north-east states. 
 
 In the next phase of training, the women will be given training specific to Delhi like climbing multi-storeys and structures within seconds to rescue hostages from a room located in a hotel, DTC bus or the metro. The squad will be armed with Glock pistols, MP-5 sub-machine guns, hand grenades and Kalashnikov rifles, and, along with their male counterparts, will be the backbone of Special Cell. The women will be stationed at important locations near Lutyens’ Delhi, along with anti-terror unit Parakram.
 
 The squad has been trained in the Israeli hand-to-hand combat technique, Krav Maga. “They can spring from a resting position to action, fully armed, within a minute of an alarm,” said a police officer. Like their male counter parts, in the first phase of training, the women SWAT teams were trained at Delhi Police Training School in Jharoda Kalan where they learnt warfare techniques such as identifying and defusing improvised explosive devices, plotting out a map and initiating an assault.
 
 “Physical fitness, mental strength and expert weapon handling are key to their survival in combat...each of them are trained to shoot and kill using one shot,” said a police officer.
