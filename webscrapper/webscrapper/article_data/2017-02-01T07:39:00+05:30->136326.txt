BATHINDA: With elections just four days away, 14 trucks carrying 1,000 cases of liquor each from a distillery in Dera Bassi, Mohali district, to Abohar and Muktsar sent the alarm bells ringing among officials at Bhucho town, near Bathinda, on Monday night. 

 When the trucks were stopped at a naka near   in Bhucho and checked, officials were in for a shock on checking the stock of alcochol stored in the trucks. However, they let the trucks go by Tuesday afternoon, after a thorough verification of documents. 
 
 Of the 14 trucks, 13 were meant for   in Abohar, which is controlled by murder-accused liquor baron Shiv Lal Doda’s family, and one truck was meant for Gaurav Wines in Muktsar.
 
 What baffled the authorities was that the trucks were supposed to reach at 8pm on Monday night, but were near Bhucho even after 11 pm. “Abohar is another two hours from Bhucho,” excise and taxation department officials said.
 
 Two days ago, excise officials at Bathinda had seized 1.14 lakh liquor bottles from two godowns on Dabwali road.
 
 When contacted, Bhucho assembly constituency returning officer (RO) Rahul Chaba said time variance had baffled their teams. “We thoroughly checked documents and found that time was wasted at internal collection centres near Banur, at flyover near Rajpura and various nakas,” he said.
 
 Bathinda assistant excise and taxation commissioner ( ) V P Singh said the trucks had valid permits, but they thoroughly checked each document before letting them go.
