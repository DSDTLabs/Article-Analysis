MUMBAI: The   has extended the date of the   ( )   ( ) to amend its constitution as per the Lodha reforms to June 15.

 
 
 TOI had earlier reported that in light of the Supreme Court asking for suggestions from the state associations before finalizing it on May 11, the HC had set a revised timeline of July 31 for holding fresh elections of the MCA as per the Lodha reforms. Earlier, the association was supposed to have conducted its elections by June 30, with the SGM scheduled in mid-May.
 
 On Monday, in a note put up on the MCA website for the members of the association, the HC-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA), comprising of retired justices HL Gokhale (Chairman of the committee) and VM Kanade to implement the Lodha reforms in the cricket body, said: “In view of the SC taking up the BCCI matter and adjourning it to May 11, the administrators appointed by the Bombay HC thought it fit to approach the court to bring this development to its notice. This is because the SC may make some more suggestions which the Mumbai Cricket Association will have to consider while amending the constitution.”
 
 The note further adds: “The Bombay HC was therefore moved by taking out a notice of motion and the court has extended the date for holding the SGM to June 15 and the date for completing the process of election to July 31.” The CoA had also attached a scanned copy of its application made to the HC and the court’s subsequent order.
 
 Presently, the CoA, appointed by the Bombay HC last month to ensure the implementation of Lodha reforms in the MCA, is in the process of drawing up a fresh draft constitution, which will be in line with the SC-accepted recommendations, for the cricket body. The CoA has held a meeting with the MCA members in this regard on April 25.
