 Fergie said she asked Ventimiglia to guide her through the kissing scenes. 
 
 "I just had to tell him, like, 'Please help me with this. I wanna just try to be in the moment, if you could help me. I don't want to be thinking about where's the light and where's the camera because I'll just completely be hidden under hair.'"
