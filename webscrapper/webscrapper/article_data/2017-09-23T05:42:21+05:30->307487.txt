 Dr Vallabh Kathiriya, chairman of the State Gau Seva Ayaog recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and made presentation on the concept of livestock industrial parks. 
 
 “Cows and other milch animals will be reared at such parks,” Kathiriya said. “A large number of milk processing units and units for dairy products will be built in large numbers.” 
 
 He further said that the park would be like any other industrial park and will have anything and everything that can benefit from livestock. “We expect to promote micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) units in the proposed parks,” Kathiriya said. 
 
 “The Gau Seva Ayaog and the state government are preparing a draft policy and schemes for financial and other incentives for the parks,” Kathiriya said. “We hope to start with few a parks in North and Central Gujarat where the dairy sector is thriving.” 
 
 “Gau Seva, Gau Raksha and Gau Sanskruti are not just terms but values that carry tremendous emotional and cultural significance. The Gujarat model of gau seva has become a standard for other states,” Kathiriya said. 
 
 The National Livestock Mission was launched in the financial year 2015 with an approved outlay of Rs 28 billion during the 12th five-year plan. Gujarat government is also trying to get maximum funds from the central government under the mission.
 
 The Centre has recently relaxed animal husbandry norms by doing away with the requirement of “controlled conditions” which has restricted multinational R&D agencies from entering India. 
 
 This is expected to invite leading bio-genetics firms to introduce their technology to improve animal breeds and thus increase yield for farmers and milk producers. Gujarat government may give incentives for such industries.
