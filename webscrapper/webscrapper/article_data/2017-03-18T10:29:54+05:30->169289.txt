BENGALURU: Thirty-nine months after she survived a harrowing attack in an ATM kiosk in the city,   on Friday positively identified her assailant  , who was arrested by   police last month.

 It was a moment of closure for Jyothi, when standing inside the admission room at   central prison, she said, “Yes, it's him. I can recognize his face.“
 
 The identification parade did not last an hour, said a jail official. “Mujeed from Hindupur in AP, to whom Reddy sold the mobile he stole from Jyothi, had also identified him,“ he added.
 
 A senior officer who was at the parade said, “Jyothi, who looked calm when she came in, appeared disturbed when she saw Reddy.“
 
 Reddy attacked Jyothi on November 19, 2013 in an ATM kiosk near  , when she refused to give him money. After the attack, Reddy pulled down the shutter and fled. She was found in a semi-conscious state after two schoolboys alerted cops.
