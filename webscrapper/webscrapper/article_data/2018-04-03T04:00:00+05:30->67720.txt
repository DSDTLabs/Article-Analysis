Chennai: The race for the top spot in the fast growing utility vehicles market is getting exciting.  Almost 2 years after it lost its numero uno position in the UV/SUV market to Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra is back in the game. M&M out sold Maruti in UVs in March with 24,593 units compared to Maruti’s 22,764 units. This was the third month in a row it did so. For the January-March quarter too M&M is back on the top with 67,805 units compared to Maruti’s 63,781 units.  However for the full year FY18 Maruti is still firmly ahead at 2,53,759 units compared to M&M’s 2,33,915 units. For the full year FY17-18 M&M’s UV sales were up 5% while Maruti’s were up nearly 30%. Consider the monthly stats. M&M sold 22,235 units in January compared to Maruti’s 20,693 units.  In February M&M sold 20,977 units while Maruti sold 20324 units. March numbers put M&M at 24593 units compared to Maruti’s 22,764 units. Said M&M president-automotive sector Rajan Wadhera : “M&M regaining the #1 position in UV market share in Q4 F18 has been achieved through a combination of factors and efforts. On the product front, Bolero Power+ and the new Scorpio saw demand growing while product and marketing interventions have brought increased traction for the TUV300 and the refreshed KUV100 NXT.” That apart what also helped is a combination of rural focus and digital push. “Our focused rural strategy has led to increased network reach and penetration in rural and upcountry markets and brought us 12% overall growth in upcountry markets” said Wadhera.  “Finally, our focus on digital has led to a strong 8% sales contribution for key UV brands coming from online leads” he added. For its part Maruti dealers say the company is sitting on healthy pending orders and the Q4 numbers are the result of year end portfolio management. “The Vitara Brezza has bookings of 35000 units and the S cross has another 6,650 units” said a dealer source.
