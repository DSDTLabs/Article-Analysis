TRICHY: Even as Rs 116 crore has been allotted by the state government for crop loan with cooperative societies, farmers alleged that they were made to run from pillar to post to get loans sanctioned by the concerned secretary and chairman of primary agriculture cooperative credit societies (PACCS), farmers alleged. Authorities in some PACCS have been selective while sanctioning crop loans, farmers alleged at the grievance day meeting held here on Thrusday. 

 Most of the authorities from the credit cooperative societies, such as Mannachanallur,  , Thalugai and  , were trying their best to deny farmers crop loans, said P  , state president of Desiya, Thenninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam.
 
 He said that  , a woman farmer, from Nagar village in Lalgudi taluk, managed to get crop loan for her two-acre land after struggling for many years. He appreciated district collector   and joint registrar of co-operatives K C Ravichandran for their effort to take necessary steps to help her.
 
 “When a farmer   of Alangudi Mahajanam village holding four acres of land approached for crop loan, she was only sanctioned Rs 10,000 altogether, though she was eligible to get Rs 26,000 per acre. Out of the sanctioned loan, she was forced to purchase fertilizer for Rs 9,000 and only given Rs 1,000 in hand,” Ayyakannu alleged.
 
 Farmers also alleged that PACCS, as well as the commercial banks, were keen on auctioning unclaimed jewels, even though farmers were ready to recover them.
 
 In reply,   instructed the joint registrar of cooperatives to initiate a probe, headed by an assistant registrar of cooperatives, on Ayyakannu’s allegation and asked to table the report within a week. He also warned the concerned secretary and chairman of PACCS of stern action.
