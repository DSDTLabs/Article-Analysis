LUCKNOW: The   claimed that Dr Joydeep Sircar’s family informed them about his death two-and-a-half hours after the incident on Thursday. 

 Dharamvir Singh Chauhan, Dr Sircar’s peon from past five years, was the first to see the body. “Dr Sircar came home around 5:15pm after dropping his children at a coaching centre in  . He asked for a cup of tea and went to the roof. I took the tea at around 5.30pm and found him lying in a pool of blood,” he told police. 
 
 Chauhan said he informed the family members and some of Dr Sircar’s friends. He said Dr Sircar’s elder brother Sudeep had gone out to perform a medical surgery. Wife Anuraka, who runs a culinary academy, was visiting a friend next door. He called up both, informed them about the incident and rushed Dr Sircar to KGMU   in a car with the help of the driver. Sircar’s wife and brother also rushed to the trauma centre on their own as they came to know about the incident. 
 
 At around 6:20pm, after examining the body, doctors at KGMU declared Dr Sircar brought dead. At 7pm,   informed the police outpost.
 
 SHO Mahangar, SK Singh, said that Sircar’s brother Sudeep called him at around 8pm to inform about the incident. Around 1:30am, the autopsy was carried out by a panel of doctors which confirmed two bullet injuries. 
 
 SP (Trans-Gomti) Durgesh Kumar said that if police are informed of the incident in time, it is easier to prevent contamination of the crime scene.
 
 Family members said that they were shocked after the incident and informed police as soon as they got time after Sircar was declared dead. KGMU authorities, they said, had already informed police, so police’s claim of late information does not hold ground.
