ALLAHABAD: Amid reports that Justice Narayan   of the Allahabad high court was indicted by an in-house inquiry committee that probed allegations against him in the   (MCI) admission scam case and had proceeded on a 90-day leave after all judicial work had been withdrawn from him, registrar general   confirmed on Wednesday that Justice Shukla had stopped coming to court.

 Khan, however, refused comment on reports of "withdrawal of judicial work" from Justice Shukla and his "90-day leave". 
 
 The high court did not release any official communication regarding either the withdrawal of work from Justice Shukla or his leave. Justice Shukla was under probe for allegations of over-ruling restraint orders passed by the   on August 29, 2017, to allow  , Lucknow, to admit students for the 2017-18 academic year. He had allegedly made hand-written corrections on September 4 to his own bench's order of September 1 to allow this medical college to admit students for the 2017-18 academic session.
 
 However, on November 23, the SC had passed a final order in the case stating that the HC did not show judicial propriety and ordered GCRG Institute of Medical Sciences to pay Rs 10 lakh to each student who had taken admission apart from refunding their fees.
 
  A fine of Rs 25 lakh was also imposed by the   on the medical college, which had been debarred by the MCI for many deficiencies.
