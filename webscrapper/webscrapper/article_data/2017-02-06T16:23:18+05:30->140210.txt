NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has warned employees of disciplinary action if they criticize the government or its policies.

 The directive assumes significance as associations representing employees of Central Board of Excise and   (CBEC) are protesting against certain decisions taken by the   Council led by finance minister Arun Jaitley on Goods and  .
 
 "Instructions have been issued in the past wherein it has been impressed upon all concerned to refrain from commenting adversely on the government and its policies," the ministry said in a recent order.
 
 It said failing to comply with its instructions "may lead to appropriate action (including disciplinary action)".
 
 The instructions cite service rules that bar any government servant from making any adverse criticism of any policy or action of the government.
 
 "No government servant shall, in any radio broadcast, telecast through any electronic media or in any document published in his own name or anonymously, pseudonymously or in the name of any other person or in any communication to the press or in any public utterance, make any statement of fact or opinion which has the effect of an adverse criticism of any current or recent policy or action of the central government or state government," reads the service rules.
 
 Certain members of Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Central Excise), All India Association of Central Excise Gazetted Executive Officers, All India Central Excise Inspectors' Association and All India Central Excise and Service Tax Ministerial Officers Association had recently participated in a symbolic protest to oppose some decisions taken by the GST Council.
 
 When contacted, President of IRS (Customs and Central Excise) officers association, Anup Srivastava, said their members are not adversely commenting on the state's policies by any way.
