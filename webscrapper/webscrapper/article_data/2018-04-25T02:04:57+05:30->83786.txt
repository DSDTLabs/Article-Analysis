NEW DELHI: The   and   of a cash   heroically resisted a robbery bid despite being shot at outside a   on Tuesday afternoon. The bid was foiled and Rs 27 lakh saved in the process. 

 The incident occurred around 3pm when the   van belonging to a well-known logistics company had gone to Metro Vihar to replenish an Axis Bank ATM. The custodian, Tarachand, was waiting outside for the cashier to finish putting the money into the ATM while driver Ram Varan parked the vehicle in such a way so as to guard the gate. Three youths ran out of a lane near the ATM and held Tarachand at gunpoint. “Initially, I thought it was a case of road rage but soon realised their intention,” Tarachand said in his statement. 
 
 Seeing Tarachand facing a gun, Ram Varan stepped out of the vehicle and confronted the men. They shot him in the leg. As Ram Varan fell, Tarachand tried to run inside the ATM and close the door. At this, he was shot in the leg too. But despite being hit, Tarachand managed to pull down the shutter, thereby locking himself and the cashier inside. “The men kept hitting on the shutter for a while, but left after sometime. We were saved since they did not have a way to get inside,” Tarachand said. 
 
 Though DCP (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta could not be contacted, sources said the assailants could be local criminals from Metro Vihar. Locals said that a similar incident was reported last year when some youths tried to attack two employees of a cash van. But the bid had been foiled by alert bystanders. Bank officials said the custodians of cash vans are instructed to carry less amounts of cash in these areas to prevent such incidents.
 
 A case of attempt to murder has been registered against the youths, and both Tarachand and Ram Varan have been admitted to a hospital. Doctors said that they are out of danger.
