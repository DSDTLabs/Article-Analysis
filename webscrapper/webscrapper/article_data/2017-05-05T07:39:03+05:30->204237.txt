LUCKNOW: The city police are gearing up to press section 467 of Indian Penal Code against the owners of filling stations who shortchanged motorists for years by giving less amount of petrol to them. Carrying minimum punishment of 10 years on conviction, the section relates to forging valuable security (forging document through which legal rights are created).

 “As   have rigged their books to mislead oil companies, section 467 would be added to the FIRs lodged against them,” said senior superintendent of police, Deepak Kumar. A special investigation team comprising seven police officers had been constituted to probe the fraud.
 
 So far, nine FIRs have been lodged and 26 people have been arrested and sent to prison and remain in judicial custody. IPC sections 265, 266, 267, 420, 34 and 120B were pressed against the owners of fuel stations and fuel attendants, apart from Essential Commodities Act before they were sent to jail. “Dealers are legally bound to submit correct sale proceeds to oil companies and in Lucknow they have been fudging their records. Their stock registers and books will be tallied,” said Kumar, explaining the legal proceedings which have been contemplated.
 
 Those who have not updated their registers will be also be held accountable of forgery, as marketing discipline guidelines set up by oil companies require them to maintain the demand and supply on a daily basis.
 
 The police team will issue notices to oil company staffers and record their statements before slapping IPC section 467 in order to strengthen the case.
