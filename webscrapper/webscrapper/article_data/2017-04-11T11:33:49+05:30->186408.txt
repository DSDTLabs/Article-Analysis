PUNE: The   Post-Graduate and   Institute is introducing a certificate course in research methodology, to assist PhD candidates in preparing their research. 

 During the six-month course, students will be made familiar with the methods and techniques of research, and the procedures involved. They will also be given hands-on experience in conducting their research. The course is worth five credits. Daylong sessions will be held six days a week, with the course culminating in December.
 
 The   makes it compulsory for PhD students to attend a course in research methodology. “Keeping in mind the needs and requirements of the students going for a doctorate, we decided to make this an open certificate course, as opposed to a private course restricted to Deccan College only,” course coordinator   said.
 
 Till last year, Kulkarni said, the course was open only for students of Deccan College, but that changed this year due to the rising demand. 
 
 The course syllabus includes an introduction to various aspects of research — collection of data, report writing and power-point presentations. Students would be introduced to the concept of scientific research, methodology, methods and techniques, various stages and procedures of academic research, and the all-important hands-on experience.
