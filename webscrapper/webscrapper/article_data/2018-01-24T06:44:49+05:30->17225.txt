HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday issued notices to the management of   asking it to explain its stand on a petition that alleges that the multiplex, particularly its large screen theatre, does not have adequate and spacious exits for people to either leave the theatre or be evacuated in case of emergencies.

 The Bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice M  , which converted an alarming letter written by Secunderabad resident   into a public interest petition, also issued notices to the chief secretary, home secretary who is also dealing with the cinematography subject, and the principal secretaries of the municipal administration and revenue departments. Notices were also issued to the dis- trict collector, district fire officer and Hyderabad poli-
 
 ce commissioner asking them to expla- in as to what have they done in this regard.
 
 Vijay in his letter narrated how his complaint to the police commissioner did not yield any response. “Though the Imax structure is not in tune with Cinemas Regulations Act 1955 and though the commissioner is the licencing authority for such theatres, no FIR has been registered so far based on my complaint. My plea before the human rights commission on this is currently pending. The mall management is endangering the lives of people and the police commissioner is neglecting his duty,” he said.
 
 Majority of the judges of the PIL Committee in high court too felt that this subject needed to be taken up as a PIL petition. In fact, one judge wanted this PIL to lo- ok at other theatres sho- wing scant regard to fire safety norms.
