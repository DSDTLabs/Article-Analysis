Chandigarh: In what can be a major relief to hundreds of people involved in Haryanaâ€™s multiple  , the state government on Thursday submitted a draft policy regarding compounding of the cases related to the scam, where plots were taken in areas developed by   by forging documents.

  advocate general (AG) B R   said the draft policy had been submitted to the court of Justice   for approval and the cases against illegal allottees would be withdrawn as per the policy. Mahajan, however, made it clear that the cases would be withdrawn only after payment of amount prescribed in the policy to Huda by the accused. He said that any further decision would be taken after high court approval.
 
 If approved by the court, the policy would be a major respite for hundreds of persons including several defence officers and other VVIPs who had illegally procured allotment in Huda-developed sectors by giving false affidavits. At present, around 1,500 FIRs have been registered and around 2,100 persons have been booked by the police in the scam.
 
 The irregularities in the allotment of HUDA plots surfaced in 2013, when the HC had ordered a probe in the matter after finding that a large number of defence personnel in Haryana were getting plots in Huda sectors on forged affidavits. They were entitled to get one plot under defence category under subsidized rates in their life time but most of them managed to get from 2 to 20-25 plots by submitting false affidavits and concealing previous allotments.
 
 Though the FIRs were registered on HC directions, further legal proceedings against the accused have been stayed. In November 2015, the HC had asked Huda to consult with the Haryana government to formulate a policy regarding compounding of the cases related to the scam.
