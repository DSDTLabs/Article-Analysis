BHOPAL: The artistry of three-dimensional drawing on walls is on display in the state capital. But if one tries looking for these 3-D drawings in the city’s art galleries, it would be in vain. As part of the civic body’s ‘My City, My Wall’ initiative, streets along areas like   and Link Road-1 are donned by these drawings that seem to come alive.

 Drawn on one of the walls is an illustration of a countryside road which seems to pop out onto the pavement from the frame in which it is painted. Making use of the geometric animated effect of the white wall, simple colours create an illusion of 3-D art.
 
 Walls along a co-operative bank are also being painted by a group of artists, which includes three female artists.
 
 “It is an opportunity, to express ourselves in a non-conventional setting. Most of our images reflect the theme of Swach Bharat Mission,” said  , who along with Aarti Chouhan, Swati Verma, Vipin Verma, Aditya Datta and   have been given different sites in   to paint. Some of these painters have won accolades at the national level.
 
 Few and far in between, the images do catch onlookers imagination.  , a businessman at New Market, said that the drawings were a welcome break from the normalcy of painting on walls for ‘painting’s sake’.
