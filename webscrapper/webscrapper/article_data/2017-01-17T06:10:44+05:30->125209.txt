KOLKATA: At a time when   has planned a slew of protest programmes across the country against Narendra Modi’s “arrogance”, the state   is crying foul against the “ruling Trinamool denying space to the opposition” in the run up to the CPM rally on January 18 where party general secretary   will address the gathering. The event will be held at the   grounds.

 CPM North 24-Parganas district secretariat member Palas Das complained that some men introducing themselves as PWD employees are pulling down the rally banners and placards along VIP Road from Ultadanga to Kestopur. 
 
 “Never before have we come across a situation where government employees are into this job. We went to the police to find out if there was any directive from the state, but they told us there was no such directive. I fear that it is the handiwork of Trinamool, who can’t justify the job in public. They are thus introducing themselves as PWD employees,” Das said. 
 
 On Monday, there were fresh reports of CPM banners bearing former chief minister Jyoti Basu’s photo being removed from VIP Road.
