MUMBAI: A fortnight after a group of drug addicts tried to sexually abuse a 13-year-old boy and set his trousers on fire outside  , Goregaon (E), three people, including a minor, have been arrested. 

 The incident took place on December 28, but the police said that the family lodge a sexual abuse complaint recently.
 
 The boy was on his way home with a 15-year-old friend when the addicts, snorting on a cloth soaked in thinner, stopped them outside Film City.
