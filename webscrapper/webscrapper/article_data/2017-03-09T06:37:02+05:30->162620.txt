 The corporation said that the cables were laid by Bharati Airtel. "The telecommunication company has not obtained permission or approvals from the local body for laying cables," said P M Harris, chairman, works standing committee . The civic body came across these cables when local people complained about their presence which clogged the drain.

 Kadavanthra councillor P J Joseph said that no agency, government or private, was not allowed to lay cables or any other materials through drains. "The cables came to our notice when we began reconstruction work on the drain and road relaying works. As the councillor I had asked the telecommunication company to remove it but they kept postponing the activity. Finally I approached corporation officials to get it removed," he said.
 
 It is pointed out that the local body suffered huge revenue loss due to the unauthorised laying of cables across the city. According to Harris, the estimated revenue loss in the last one year in the form of track rent would come to Rs 50 crore.
 
 Earlier, telecommunication companies had to pay track rent of Rs 34,000 per cable per km per year. Later it was revised and the current tariff is Rs 50,000 per cable per km per year.
 
 The unauthorised cables in the drain were removed in the presence of councillors and police. Couple of days ago the company had submitted an application seeking permission for laying cables.
 
 During the midnight of February 23, the corporation had stopped Bharati Airtel from carrying out road cutting works on Ashoka Road near Kaloor.
