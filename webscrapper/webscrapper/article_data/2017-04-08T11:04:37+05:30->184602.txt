PUNE: Received a   from an  , presumably from a  ?   as it may come at a premium, sometimes as high as  . 

 Several people in the state were woken up from their deep sleep in the early hours on Friday after receiving missed calls on their cellphones from unknown numbers.
 
 Kothrud-resident Nilesh Patil's cellphone started ringing around 12.35am. "After I checked the phone, I saw a missed call from an unknown number. Thinking that someone from my office may have called, I tried to call back, but to no avail," Jagtap told TOI.
 
 Within an hour, Somnath Walke, a teacher at a Beed-based school, received a similar call. However unlike Jagtap, he did not bother to call back since the number was unknown.
 
 Walke said many of his friends from Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Jalgaon too received such calls past midnight. "They received the calls between 12.30am and 6.30am. All the numbers started with +96," he said.
 
 Police said the people who tried to call back may have ended up paying Rs 100-Rs 200 had their calls connected. Amount ranging between Rs 50-100 has been deducted from people's talktime balance just for receiving such calls.
 
  Part of a racket 
 
 Sunil Pawar, inspector of the cyber-crime cell of the Pune police, told TOI that this could be a part of a racket, which operates from call centres in other countries. "If any one returns the call, the call centres get commission for it," Pawar said.
 
 He said it was the modus of the callers to make the calls to their victims during night hours, when they are not very alert. 
 
  Apps to rescue 
 
 A Pune professional who received a call at 6.15am checked who the caller was by using a caller identification app. "The app showed that the call was from one Sudhir from Maldives. Since I do not know anybody of that name, I did not answer the call," she said.
