At a time when people are running around to get tickets of Bahubali: The Conclusion and to learn the reason for why  , Kerala's National Award winning actor Salim Kumar came out with his own version of the story.

 It's at a recent meeting in the State that the actor narrated it, to the delight of an elated audience. The comedian, who surprised the audience a bit by saying, "See, I am going to reveal the suspense of Bahubali," went on to explain the reason. "After Kattappa and Bahubali lost a war, they were in a forest. Then, when Kattappa expressed his anguish about the same, Babhubali told him, 'LDF varum, ellam seriyaakum' (referring to the punchline of a party in Kerala in the recent elections). That is when Kattappa drew out a rusted sword and pierced through him," said the actor, which was followed by roars of laughter. Well, regardless of the party inclinations and the actor's intentions to narrate it, the social media has lapped it up and humorous comments have been coming it's way. 
 
 Bahubali had hit theaters on April 28 and the video of the actor giving his version has been doing the rounds on social media for the past two days.
