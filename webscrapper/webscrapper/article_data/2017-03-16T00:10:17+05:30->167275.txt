Varanasi: The traditional annual festival of   will be celebrated at Assi Ghat on March 21. The musical festival that coincides with 104th birth anniversary of shehnai maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan will be dedicated to the late musician who played a pivotal role in revival of the most celebrated festival. 

 “This year, Budhwa Mangal is being celebrated on March 21 which happens to be the birth anniversary of the Shehnai king. We have decided to dedicate the festival to him and his favorite semi-classical songs like Chaiti, Hori and Dadra will be performed. We have also roped in shehnai players Shankar Bandhu of Banaras Gharana (also part of Anoushka Shankar’s music band) and artists from Kolkata to perform at the event,” said regional cultural officer and director of folk and tribal arts culture society, Ratnesh Verma.
 
 According to Verma, around 10-12 bajras (big boats) will be arranged for the musical festival to be held midstream in the Ganga. Screens will also be put up at Assi ghat for people to view the performances. Traditional welcome will be offered to guests followed by thandai on the occasion.
 
 Notably, the tradition of celebrating Budhwa Mangal, the day when celebration of Holi ends in the holy city, is over 300 years old. However, due to certain reasons, the festival was stopped in 1936. It was later revived by culture department in 1996 on the call of Shehnai maestro late Bismillah Khan.
