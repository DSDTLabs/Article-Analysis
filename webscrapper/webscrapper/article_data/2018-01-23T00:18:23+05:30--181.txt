NAVI MUMBAI: A   by the Koparkhairance   on Saturday. The traffic cops had towed away bikes that were parking along the no parking zone. The accused, who is a minor, came to the traffic chowkie to collect his bike. But he was unable to produce the bike documents. 

 API Sachin Khondre of Koparkhairane traffic unit said, “On Saturday, our team had towed away several bikes that were illegally parked near Kopar Khairane and Ghansoli railway station. Those whose bikes were towed came to the traffic chowkie and paid the penalty and towing charges, after which their vehicles were handed over to them.’’
 
 He added, ‘‘A 16-year-old boy, resident of Sector 11, came to the chowkie to claim two of his bikes. When we asked him to show us the bikes papers, he kept giving excuses that he had left the papers at home. When the traffic cops told him to bring the papers he gave evasive replies. So, we checked the registration numbers of the bikes with the RTO. We then learnt that the bikes belonged to someone else and the boy was not the owner. After much grilling, he confessed that he, along with a friend, had stolen the bikes. They used to park the stolen bikes on the roadside and used them whenever they needed to go for a ride,” Khondre added. The minor was handed over to the Koparkhairane police station. 
 
 From there he was sent to a juvenile remand home, the official said.
