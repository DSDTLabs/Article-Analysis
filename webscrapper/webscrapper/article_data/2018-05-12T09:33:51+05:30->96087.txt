PUNE:   has increased monitoring of Indian garlic and garlic products after export samples from the country were found to have pesticide residue in March.

 
 The monitoring inspection will increase by up to 30% after an export consignment of garlic from Maharashtra was found to have residues of a pesticide called ‘imidacloprid’.
 
 The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority ( ) recently issued a notification to exporters stating that the Embassy of India, Tokyo, Japan has said that the Japanese department of environmental health and food safety, under its ministry of health, labour and welfare, has increased the frequency of monitoring inspection on imidacloprid to 30% in order to check violation of the Food Sanitation Law there.
 
 A senior APEDA official said most exporters of various commodities, including garlic, are from Pune, Mumbai in Maharashtra and Mahuva in Gujarat. “Pesticide residues could have been found in the exported food product or its container. We are still to investigate that. Japan is a highly strict market with stringent importing norms,” the official said.
 
 He added that Japan has phased out specific target compounds, such as imidacloprid and other pesticides, from its markets just as India has been phasing out the use of DDT. “Hence, Japan’s stand on increasing the frequency of monitoring on Indian garlic and its processed products,” he said.
 
 On similar lines, other food products from India such as fennel seeds, immature fruits of Indian cardamom, cumin seeds and fenugreek seeds are also being subjected to frequent inspection in Japan for pesticides like iprobenfos, insecticides like triazophos and substances such as aflatoxin.
 
 APEDA had also recently issued an advisory to exporters of fresh fruits to China, which said that the Chinese government has released the   for maximum residue limits for pesticides in foods, including grapes and mangoes.
