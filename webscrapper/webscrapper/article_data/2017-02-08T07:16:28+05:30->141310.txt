PUNE: Dry conditions continue to prevail in the city, with no respite from the ongoing February heat. The city’s minimum temperature has dipped slightly to 13C from 15C as recorded on February 5, yet the temperature remains above normal.   forecasters have predicted an increase in the day temperatures, which may go up to 33C in the next couple of days.

  recorded near normal day temperature on Tuesday at 32.1C while the minimum temperature stood at 13.3C, around two degrees above normal. Except Kolhapur, all   (IMD) stations in central Maharashtra recorded slightly above normal temperatures on Tuesday, with above normal minimums in most places except Malegaon, Nashik and Solapur.
 
 Around February 10, maximum temperature in the city is likely to rise to 33C, while night temperature will range from 14C to 15C.
 
 An IMD official said that February is a month of transition, with winter giving way to the pre-monsoon season, which begins in March. “The temperature is gradually normalising, rising from the below-normal winter levels,” he said.
 
 Weather forecasters said cold and dry northerly winds are not penetrating into Maharashtra, keeping temperatures here at normal to above normal levels.
 
 Sources in the   said that both January and February are considered to be the most dry months of the year. “The rainfall average in January is zero for Pune. The rainfall figure in February is no better, when the city’s average rain is 0.5mm. The city is expected to remain dry during the rest of the month. One of the reasons for no rains in February is the lack of formation of weather systems in the   during this time of the year,” said a source.
