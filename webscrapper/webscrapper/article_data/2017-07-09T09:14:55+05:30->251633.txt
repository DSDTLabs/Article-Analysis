PATNA: The Bihar government on Saturday contradicted reports in a section of the media that it had prior information from the Prime Minister’s   about the CBI raids on RJD chief  , son and deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and wife Rabri Devi. 

 The CBI on Friday raided 12 premises of Lalu and his associates, including Rabri’s official 10, Circular Road residence, in a case related to alleged irregularities in the allotment of two railway hotels through a tender floated by IRCTC when Lalu was rail minister from 2004 to 2009. 
 
 Principal secretary (information and public relations department) Brijesh   told TOI the state government did not have prior information about the raids. “The state government came to know about the raids only after the raids commenced at Patna on Friday morning,” Mehrotra said. 
 
 A government press communiqué issued on Friday also denied reports that the chief secretary or DGP had information about the raids. “There was no information about the raid on July 6, as reported by a section of the media. The DGP received the first information about the raid over the phone around 7.30am on Friday,” the press release said.
 
  (headquarters) S K Singhal said the CBI informed three-four officers, including the DGP, simultaneously once the raids started. “I got the information from Patna SSP about the raid on the premises of RJD chief and I ordered for deployment of security forces at different buildings, including party offices,” the ADG said.
