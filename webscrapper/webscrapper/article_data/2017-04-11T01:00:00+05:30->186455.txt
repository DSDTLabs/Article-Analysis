Hi Guys, 
How’s your Tuesday morning going? Mine, not so great. My hangover is killing me! I know, it’s only the second day of the week. But that is exactly what the doctor ordered after the manic Monday I had. And... I just got a text from my boss to come in earlier than usual today. Tuesday is really just Monday’s ugly cousin. Amidst all this, Zara (#BFF) has sent me a picture from her breakfast date, in which she looks like she just stepped out of a Bollywood film. I, on the other hand, feel like a wreck. I even ate like a glutton last night… No wonder mera weight mere Twitter followers se zyaada hai... Sigh. What is it about ‘perfection’ that we all constantly strive to achieve it? Why do we feel that if we had the perfect body or the perfect boyfriend or the perfect job, we’d be happy… If we wait for it all to be perfect, can we ever truly be content? Maybe not. So says Zara, too. Plus, if everything was perfect, we’d never make any mistakes, never learn anything new, never grow. We’d all be human robots, alike and boring. Scary thought, na? So bring on the quirks, celebrate your imperfections and learn to love yourself for who you are. #ImperfectIsPerfect. Some food for thought today. Okay, gotta run now. Until next time. 
 Love,
