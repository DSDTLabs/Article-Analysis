GANDHINAGAR: The state government’s recent housing demand survey, by the   in the state, has estimated that 9.78 lakh affordable houses are needed in the state.

 The survey was carried out under the government of India’s Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ( ).
 
 In the state budget for 2017-18, the Gujarat government set a target of 45,000 affordable houses under PMAY and   (MSVY) and another one lakh under other schemes. It is thus likely that it will take a minimum of 7 to 8 years to meet the full demand, estimated at 9.78 lakh units. The recent state budget allocated Rs 1,340 crore for the various housing schemes.
 
 Even if the Gujarat government meets the target of one lakh such houses this election year, it is unlikely that it will meet PM Narendra Modi’s tall target of “housing for all by 2022”.
 
 The survey does not include housing under slum redevelopment schemes. The estimate is claimed to have been made scientifically but it is possible that many of those in need of housing were not included in the survey.
 
 The survey estimates that 3.34 lakh homes will be needed in in Ahmedabad district alone, mainly in Ahmedabad city. Surat is next with a demand for 1.28 lakh affordable homes. Rajkot needs 98,841 houses and Vadodara 63,964.
 
 Under the survey, 3,47,396 homes will be needed under the Affordable Housing Project, which is based on public-private partnership (PPP). The requirement for some 1,17,302 dwellings will be   (beneficiary-led construction). The biggest requirement estimated, 5,13,362 houses, is under the CLS ( ), where the government provides a 6.5% interest subsidy for homes costing up to Rs 6 lakh.
 
 Gujarat ranks at the top in implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and has covered all 171 urban areas of municipal corporations, urban development authorities and municipalities. The state government launched the PMAY in June 2015. Gujarat has 45,133 houses under construction and 3,439 houses completed, of the sanctioned 1,02,853 houses.
