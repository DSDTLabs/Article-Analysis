GREATER NOIDA: A 22-year-old  , a resident of Gautampuri in Dadri, has alleged that her husband of one year had issued her a ‘triple talaq’ as her family could not meet the demand for Rs 5 lakh as  .

 Salma, a graduate from CCS University,  , got married to Azad (25), a resident of   in Gurgaon, on April 10, 2016. However, on April 19 this year, Azad sent a text message on her father’s phone saying ‘triple talaq’. “m apki beti salma to talaq talaq talaq deta hu uske sath rehna haram hi (sic),” the text message reads.
 
 “I read the message and felt numb with shock. My worst fears came true. He had been threatening to divorce me from the time we got married,” Salma told TOI.
 
 On April 17, just two days before the ‘talaq’, the woman had filed a case at the Dadri police station against her in-laws for dowry harassment and also for causing hurt, breach of peace and criminal intimidation under sections 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. In the FIR, she said that her family had spent nearly Rs 15 lakh on the wedding and also gifted a Maruti Suzuki Alto, besides gold and silver jewellery, to Azad. The mediator, Israel, a relative of Azad, had allegedly told the bride’s family that the bridegroom worked as a clerk in municipal corporation of Gurgaon. Salma said that after her marriage, she soon found out that Azad had some private job and not a government one. “They started troubling me when I told them that they had duped my family by making a false claim of the government job,” Salma said. 
 
 “They demanded Rs 5 lakh more as dowry, saying the money will be used to bribe the officials for Azad’s government job,” she said. Salma filed an FIR against her husband Azad, father-in-law Aas Mohammad, sisters-in-law Rasmeena and Asmeena and mother-in-law and mediator Israel. 
 
 TOI contacted Azad, who admitted to having given ‘triple talaq’ denied the allegations of dowry. He rather alleged domestic violence from Salma’s side.
