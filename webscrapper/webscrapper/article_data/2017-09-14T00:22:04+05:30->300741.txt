The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of   arrested Madhukar Megh Rupji and his son Tejal of Rupji Constructions under various Indian Penal Code sections for cheating, forgery, breach of trust and criminal conspiracy, and under the stringent Maharashtra Ownership Flat Act, 1963 (MOFA). 

 Police officials said though the firm was accused of cheating 16 buyers in Ghatkopar, the complaint had been filed by only one buyer, Tukaram Bilvare Kohli.
 
 Bilvare said that in 2009 he saw a newspaper advertisement in which the firm had offered a two BHK flat for Rs 7,000 per square foot. The proposed tower, Akangsha, was to come up at Sahakar Market, Pant Nagar, in Ghatkopar (E). Bilvare and his wife Shoba went to the firm’s office at Wadala and met Rupji. After going through the brochure, he decided to book a flat and paid Rs 20 lakh to the firm over one year. But when Bilvare went the site in 2012 he found no work had started despite the firm claiming it completed the project in three years.
 
 During investigations, they came across other flat buyers who had booked flats by paying 10-50% booking amounts. “Among them, M Parkar had paid Rs 39 lakh, Johar Singh had paid Rs 36 lakh and Narendra Patil Rs 36 lakh. The sum of these flat buyers came up to Rs 3.7 crore. We want to interrogate the accused to know if they had obtained basic permission and other requisites for construction of the tower,” said an officer. 
 
 Police said they want to recover the amount and want to know if builder invested it somewhere else.
