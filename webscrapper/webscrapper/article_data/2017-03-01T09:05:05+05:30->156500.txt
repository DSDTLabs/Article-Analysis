SANGRUR: The main accused in the sensational, February 16 killing of   Hardev Singh Happy (25),   Babbal Randhawa alias Dalwinder Singh, surrendered before a Sangrur court on Tuesday, following which he was remanded in seven-day police custody.

 The murder had made headlines because Babbal and his accomplices Varinder Singh, Aman Singh, Shuraja, and Gurpreet Narshi had shot Happy five times in the head in the main market of Longowal in broad daylight, and then danced on the crime spot and challenged the police to arrest them. Babbal had even posted four videos of the crime and a six-page letter on his Facebook page after the crime.
 
 The police, however, are yet to track down his accomplices.
 
 In the videos, he was seen enjoying Punjabi songs epitomizing ‘Firing by a Punjabi Jatt’, and flashing a gun. Sangrur police had managed to ascertain that Babbal had uploaded the videos near Bhawanigarh, on the Patiala-Sangrur highway. However, all the accused remained at large.
 
 Sangrur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Inderbir Singh said police had heightened vigil and raids were carried out at a number of hideouts. “Babbal surrendered in court because of the pressure exerted by us,” the SSP said. 
 
 Babbal has so far been booked in five cases of attempt to murder. Of them, he has been acquitted in two and trial is still on in three of them.
