A lot has been said and written about the leading ladies of the upcoming Kannada film  , namely  ,   and  . But their tale will not be complete without a couple of other pivotal characters, whose deviant nature pushes the girls to fight back. 

 “There are two important characters in the film, played by   and  , without whom the narrative is incomplete. In fact, when I wrote the role that Achyuth has done, I modelled it based on the characteristics of a hyena. It is the only animal that even lions and tigers fear. During my script narration, I did not tell him about this facet to the character, but he embodied it just the way I had envisioned it,” explains director  .
 
 In the film, Achyuth plays a cunning loan shark called Devara Gunda, whose modus operandi involves providing funds to people he knows will be burdened by his interest structure that they can never repay him. “Devara Gunda is a maniac who finds pleasure in others’ pain. He has a weakness, which will be revealed in the film and this has him cross paths with the three girls,” adds Pradeep.
 
 Also important to the story is the character, Bobby Doll, played by Bhavani Prakash. “Bobby was a sex worker years ago and now that she is past her prime, she has moved on to running a brothel. She is the madam of the house that the girls are in. Through the years, Bobby has seen a lot of pain her in life and her motto is to make others around her feel the same kind of pain. She is a firm, almost dictator-like character, with a level of aggression akin to a mother elephant who has lost her baby,” he says.
