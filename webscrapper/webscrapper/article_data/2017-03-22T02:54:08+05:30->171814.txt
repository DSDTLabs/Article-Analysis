NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is going to intensify its   for the upcoming municipal elections next week with party convenor and chief minister   scheduled to join in from March 31. Kejriwal is expected to address between 24 and 36 meetings across the city as a result of which he would end up attending two on some days.

 Sources said that the meetings would be ward-centric and based on the lines of Kejriwal’s campaign during the 2015 assembly elections. “Holding one big rally is not AAP’s style of campaigning. We believe in reaching out to smaller groups to give a personal touch, even if it means multiple meetings,” party sources said.
 
 Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and other senior party functionaries will also start campaigning at the end of March.
 
 Recently, the CM held a meeting with MLAs and asked them to start intensive campaigning. As a result, Sunday saw almost all MLAs, including Sisodia, carrying out padyatras through their constituencies and addressing small gatherings.
 
 AAP Delhi in-charge Ashish Talwar said, “While other parties are busy in internal squabbles, our candidates, leaders and MLAs are already on the ground. Once Kejriwal enters the campaign, the campaign on the ground will go into top gear.”
 
 With about 10-odd candidates remaining to be declared for the 272 wards, all those in fray for the polls are going door-to-door to not just interact with voters but also distribute pamphlets that talk about the work done by the government.
 
 “We are also playing a recorded message by the CM talking about the achievements of the government along with the massive corruption prevalent in the corporations. These are being shown through projectors to small audiences. As most of our candidates have been finalised, they can now carry out sustained campaigns to allow voters in their wards to become familiar with them,” said a senior party member.
