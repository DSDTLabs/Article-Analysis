CHENNAI: People interested in healthy eating will now have an opportunity to not just buy produce fresh from the farm but also to meet and interact with the farmers who cultivate them. On January 21, more than 100 farmers from across the country will converge in Chennai to participate in a market.

 “This is the first big farmer’s market that we are organising in the city, though we do have one every two weeks in our retail stores,” says  , co-founder, SunnyBee, a supply chain company that focuses on bringing fresh, clean, and safe produce from farms to cities in the most efficient way possible. The company is also focused on ensuring that people in the cities learn to respect the effort farmers put in every single day.
 
 “We already have a huge database of 26,000 farmers in our network. We thought of organising such an event as we wanted customers to meet the farmers,” says Dasarai, adding that all the proceeds from the sale will go straight to the farmers.
 
 The farmer’s market, to be held at   in   from 9am to 9pm on January 21, will have fresh produce from across India including apples from Kashmir, oranges from Nagpur, pomegranates from Nasik and strawberries from Mahabaleshwar. “Farmers can communicate directly with the customers and explain the farming techniques they follow,” says Dasarai.
