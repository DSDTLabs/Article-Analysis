PATNA: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the state government to form a committee to evaluate all financial aspects and suggest the ways for implementing equal pay for equal work for contractual teachers in Bihar.

 The division bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit also rejected the state government’s plea for stay on the Patna high court’s order passed on October 31 last year. The high court had ruled that contractual teachers in the state were eligible for pay and other benefits on par with regular government schoolteachers. The court fixed March 15 as the next date of hearing in the case. State’s standing counsel   told TOI over the phone that the bench ordered the formation of a committee to be headed by chief secretary of Bihar to suggest on how to implement the equal pay for equal work order. There are around four lakh contractual teachers in state’s primary and higher secondary government schools.
 
 The Bihar Secondary Teachers’ Struggle Committee (BSTSC) and Bihar Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh (BMSS), along with nine other individual petitioners, had filed separate writ petitions before the Patna high court on the issue.
 
 The division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice   Upadhyay of the Patna high court had also declared the rules of ‘Niyojit Shikshak Niyukti Niyamawali’ of 2006 as unconstitutional under Article 14 of the Constitution. The contractual teachers were appointed with fixed salary in the state under these rules.
 
 The BMSS in a statement said the state government would have to produce all financial records related to expenditure made on the salary of teachers.
