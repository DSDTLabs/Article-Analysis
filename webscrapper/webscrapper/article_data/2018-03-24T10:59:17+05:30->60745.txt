Chennai: The 11th round of the ongoing   in Berlin on Friday evening saw   piece together a crucial victory over Levon Aronian and move to 6 points. Karjakin’s 74-move win with black pieces was the only positive result on a day where the other three clashes ended in draws.

 Fabiano Caruana, who has been playing it safe in the last few rounds, drew with former World champion Vladimir Kramnik. The 41-move draw meant Caruana retained his top spot with 7 points from 11 outings. Closely following Caruana was Azerbaijan Grandmaster   who is on 6.5 points. Mamedyarov split points with Wesley So.
 
 The highlight of the 11th round of the competition was the victory of Karjakin. He may have had an ordinary start to the competition, losing his opening round to Mamedyarov but Karjakin has since then brought his ‘A’ game together in each of his outings. He hasn’t dropped his guard once and only gone from strength to strength.
 
 Meanwhile, Alexander Grischuk, who drew his contest against Liren Ding, is on 6 points. The top of the heap comprising Caruana, Mamedyarov, Karjakin and Grischuk will have their task cut out as the final phase of the tournament commence on Saturday.
 
 Round 12 will see leader Caruana facing off with the in-form Karjakin while Grischuk locking horns with Aronian. In the other two matches, Kramnik plays Wesley So and Mamedyarov will battle it out against Liren Ding. The winner of the competition gets to face Magnus Carlsen in the World championship final in London later this year.
