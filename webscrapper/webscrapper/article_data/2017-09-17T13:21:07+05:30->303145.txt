CHANDIGARH: At last after two decades, the city colleges can hope to hire new teachers. The grant for filling five to seven posts at each college might come from centrally sponsored scheme   (RUSA).

 During a meeting at the Sector-10 Government Home Science College here on Saturday, the state higher education council decided that RUSA will ask the institutes for individual requirement of grant. The council chairman, Panjab University vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover, said the members favoured sending a draft proposal report to the   (MoHRD), which will also be a first.
 
 Members proposed that each college can seek grant for a maximum seven new teachers. Since 1986, no college has hired regular staff in teaching. They were so short of money. The council complimented the Sector-11   and Panjab University unanimously for high   (cleanliness) rankings.
 
 Comparing the number of forms received at colleges with the count of seats assigned, the members found out that a large number of candidates had failed to find admission in Chandigarh colleges. In commerce, only 2,835 of 8,956 applicants were able to take admission under the common centralised process conducted by Panjab University. In case of science, only 2,655 of 12253 candidates could get in. For the first time, the admission to every city college was through a common online portal.
 
 RUSA’s state project director Rakesh Kumar Popli, who is also UT director of higher education, said a mobile app of e-campus solutions had been launched under RUSA. It is designed for Android and iOS platforms. RUSA’s additional state project director Dalip Kumar said the state higher education council will sign an agreement with Chandigarh Region Innovation and Knowledge Cluster (CRIKC) for encouraging research in colleges.
