PUDUCHERRY: Inspector general of prisons Pankaj Kumar Jha suspended a jail warden in Puducherry central   on Monday for  .

 Jha undertook a surprise inspection last week when a medical team visited the high-security prison to screen the inmates for any ailments. He was shocked to find that the members of the medical team had carried their mobile phones inside the prison.
 
 On inquiry, he found that the warden on duty, Selvam, neither told the medical team members to hand over their mobile phones and other items (banned inside the prison) at the gate nor thoroughly checked them before permitting them inside. He placed Selvam under suspension for dereliction of duty until further orders.
 
 In October last year, Jha suspended a deputy superintendent (prisons), a principal warden, a female warden and a male warden on charges of allowing frequent meetings of a male life convict with a female undertrial prisoner. The issue had come to light when Jha undertook a surprise inspection and interacted with the inmates. TNN
