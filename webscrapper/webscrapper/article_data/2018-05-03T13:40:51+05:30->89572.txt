TRICHY: A murder for gain case turned more serious after the second victim too died at the Thanjavur medical college hospital on Tuesday night.

 The deceased A Ramesh, 36, from Valaiyur Road in   in   on the border of Perambalur district was found battling for his life at his house in the early hours of April 23, after he was attacked by lethal weapons. His wife R Latha, 30 was found murdered at the veranda of the house. Police suspected it could be a case of murder for gain, as their family members claimed that Latha’s three sovereign worth gold chain was stolen. 
 
 Ramesh was admitted at Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH). His family members had then shifted him to a private hospital in Trichy on April 23. Following a few days of treatment there, the family on April 27 had moved him to Thanjavur medical college hospital where he was under critical care treatment. His health condition failed to improve despite treatment, said Siruganur police in Trichy on Wednesday. The post-mortem was yet to be performed. Ramesh’s death has caused a setback in the investigation as police were unable to find any clue about the culprits. They had rested their hope on Ramesh to give them details of the incident and waited for his recovery. Police suspect that the crime could have been committed by more than one person. The culprits even took away Ramesh’s bike.
