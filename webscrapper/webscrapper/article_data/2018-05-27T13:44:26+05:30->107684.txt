MEERUT: Days after Noida police’s Crime Branch came under the scanner after a ‘collection list’ of people from who money was to be demanded went viral on WhatsApp,   police have now landed in the soup over a similar embarrassing episode.
 
 A ‘collection list’ of   police station here has turned up online, forcing top officials to launch a probe. Sources revealed that the list was put out in public after an irreconcilable bickering between personnel posted at the police station and one of the aggrieved constables, already shunted to Police Lines, decided to spill the beans on his colleagues.
  
 After the matter was brought to the notice of senior superintendent of police (SSP)  , a probe was initiated by him under superintendent of police (city)   whosaid that several erring officials are slated to face severe action after the probe is over.
  
 “It has come up in the preliminary probe that policemen in the area have been involved in extorting money, leading to a brawl at the police station. This time it came out in public after one of the constables uploaded screenshots on social media,” Ranvijay Singh, SP (city) said. 
  
 The 'collection list' explicitly details the amount received on a monthly basis from local traders and the share of the cops at the police station.
  
 Earlier, Noida Crime Branch’s Special Operation Group (SOG) was dissolved after internal messages about alleged bribery and collections from local businessmen and traders became public.
  
 The list was leaked after some cops in the group had a heated argument over distribution of money collected from different sources and one of them sent the list of ‘collections’ to the UP DGP, prompting an investigation into the matter. The SOG was dissolved and all the 16 personnel were sent to Police Lines.
