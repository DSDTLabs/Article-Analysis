CHENNAI: The ruling   continued its exercise of expelling known supporters of rebel leader and independent MLA T T V Dhinakaran from the party. On Friday, the party steering committee coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator   expelled over 180 members from the party including an ex-MP and a few district level office bearers.

 Those expelled on Friday are from Chennai,   and   districts. C Gopal, a former party MP from Vellore district, is among those expelled.
 
 Incidentally, the expulsion spree of the ruling party for the first time included members of the party from Chennai, especially North Chennai where the party recently lost the bypoll to Dhinakaran. Party's candidate E  , who lost the byelection, had written a letter to Palaniswami recently, drawing his attention to some party insiders' involvement in sabotaging AIADMK's prospects in the bypoll.
