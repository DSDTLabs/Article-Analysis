AHMEDABAD: In what appears to be resistance from city police to act on DGP PP Pandey’s directive ordering the removal of airconditioners (ACs) from the chambers of inspector and sub inspector-rank officers, top city police officers have ordered a review to explore if ACs are an impediment to policing or a necessity because of technical issues.

 DGP P P   issued a directive on March 27, to remove ACs from chambers of officers not entitled to them. The   stated that these “unofficial” ACs were bloating electricity bills.
 
 The DGP’s directive said that because these ranks have non-AC vehicles, they   and sit in their airconditioned offices. The DGP asked all district chiefs and commissioners to report on the removal of ACs in ten days.
 
 However, city police ordered a review by a senior police officers on the removal of ACs. “We have sought a quick review, which will allow us to act on the DGP’s directive,” added a top police official.
 
 Police officers said that there are a lot of technical systems installed in police inspectors’ chambers nowadays, including   monitoring systems. “We assumed that wherever such devices are installed, ACs have been provided. We will hence wait for the review report,” a senior police added.
 
 Some top police officials said police station officers are not comfort-seeking and work very hard. “If the ACs are removed they will have face different types of technical problems,” added a top cop.
 
 Senior police officials added that if the review finds the removal of ACs desirable, they will get rid of them as quickly as possible.
