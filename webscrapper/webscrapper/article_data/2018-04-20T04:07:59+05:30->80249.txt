GHAZIABAD: A 25-year-old married woman has accused the principal of a private   in   of raping her multiple times on the pretext of giving her a permanent job in the college. The woman had worked as an attendant on contract basis for one year between 2016 and 2017. On Wednesday, she lodged a complaint with the SSP office.

 In the complaint, the woman, a resident of Bulandshahr, alleged that the principal had asked her to come to his house in Hapur to attend a religious function in March last year.
 
 “There was no one at his house when I reached there. The principal sexually assaulted me, and when I protested, he threatened to fire me from the job. He also threatened to kill me and my family members if I disclosed the incident to anyone. Thereafter, he raped me inside the college premises several times and also made a video of the act. At that time, I had lodged a complaint at Modinagar police station, but no action was taken. Later, under pressure, I withdrew my complaint,” she said.
 
 The woman stated that when her husband and in-laws came to know about the incident, they threw her out of the house. Since then she has been living with her brother.
 
 “I am facing ignominy from all sides. Now I have lost my job and living separately from my husband. Because of this I tried to commit suicide twice,” she said.
 
 SHO, Modinagar, Gajendra Pal Singh said, “We have received a complaint and started an inquiry. As far as I know, the woman and the other party had reached a compromise last year itself.”
