Vadodara: The current political crisis in Tamil Nadu is not just a political problem. But it also poses a security threat. This is what colonel (retired) R S N Singh, who has served with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India’s external intelligence agency, said here on Saturday. The renowned defence expert was in the city to deliver a talk on ‘India rising: A military economic perspective’ before management students at ‘Yuvantas 2017’ – the flagship event of M S University’s Faculty of Management Studies.  “There is a big difference between law and order situation and internal security problem and harmony is required between external and internal security,” he said, adding that the political uncertainty in Tamil Nadu should end at the earliest.  “In Tamil Nadu, there is a law and order machinery which does not know from whom it is taking orders. If there is a threat right now, how will it tackle the problem,” he said. “There is no president’s rule and there is total constitutional vacuum. Who will take action there when required as the chain of command is itself not known. It is necessary that instead of neglecting the entire scenario, the situation is cleared immediately,” he said.  Singh also said that even as Indians primarily confine their concerns on terrorism emanating from Pakistan, the West Bengal-Bangladesh region is evolving into another hub of jihadi terror.  “It won’t be an exaggeration if I say that some areas of West Bengal have been converted into Islamic caliphates. The bases have flourished especially in the aftermath of the unprecedented crackdown on the fundamentalists and the jihadi groups by Sheikh Hasina regime in Bangladesh,” he said.
