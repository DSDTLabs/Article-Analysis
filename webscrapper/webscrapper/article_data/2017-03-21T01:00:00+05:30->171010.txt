Actor   of   fame is currently shooting in the city for his next film,  , which is being directed by Dharanidharan. Shirish is playing a cop in this film. It was while the actor was shooting on Mint Street, Sowcarpet, in his cop-look, that some of the onlookers mistook him to be a real policeman. Shirish left the place embarrassed, apparently. The team has been shooting in Sowcarpet, Ennore and a few areas in the city as the story is set against the backdrop of north Madras.

 Ask the director about the incident, and he explains, “Shirish plays a beat police, who is on the rounds all the time. We planned a few candid shots with Shirish on the roads, where he is shown patrolling on a bike. While we were shooting, there was a small fight among the locals there, and subsequently, there was a huge traffic jam. Shirish was also stuck in that jam, and it was then that one man shouted at Shirish for keeping silent despite being a cop, and not doing anything to ease the jam. ‘You are a cop, why can’t you handle this situation, and why are you waiting along with us’ the man asked Shirish, who didn’t know how to react to this situation. We had a hearty laugh on the set recalling the incident.”
 
 Shirish says, “I was embarrassed. I was wearing the cop uniform and I stood quietly there. When this guy asked me, ‘they are fighting right in front of you, can’t you do something’, I didn’t know what to tell him. I just said, ‘I am a dupe police’ and left the place. I don’t think he understood it, though.”
