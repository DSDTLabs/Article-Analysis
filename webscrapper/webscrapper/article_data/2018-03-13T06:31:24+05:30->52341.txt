AHMEDABAD: The   was an unlikely place for Swapnil Shah (name changed), and his father on Monday afternoon but the duo had decided to pay a visit when Swapnil developed cold feet after appearing in the examination.

 Dr  ,  , said that they cater to about 150 to 200 anxious students during   almost every year. 
 
 “Generally the teens go to general practitioners but when they spot signs such as hyperventilating, excessive perspiration and fear of not remembering they reach out to us. We counsel them to give them a confidence boost and tell them not to worry about the end result as the exam is not the end of life,” he said.
 
 The Jeevan Aastha helpline (1800 233 3330) on Monday also received close to 200 calls from across the state from both parents and students. Pravin Valera, inspector of Gandhinagar police and coordinator for the helpline, said that they advised candidates to focus on what they know and not get bogged down by anything else or compare themselves with any of their friends or relatives.
 
 “If needed, we also counsel the parents as sometimes unrealistic goals hamper the confidence of the student. We ask them to focus on the present and forget the past. We also ask them to relax and have confidence in their preparations,” he said.
