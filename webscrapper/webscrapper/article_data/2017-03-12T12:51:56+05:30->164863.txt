JALANDHAR/PHAGWARA: The results of assembly elections have also come as a shocker for Punjab BJP president Vijay Sampla, with the tally coming down from 12 to three. The party lost all the three seats in Sampla’s home district Jalandhar and three in Hoshiarpur -- all in his parliamentary constituency. The only seat the party won in Doaba is Phgawara, from where his bête noire Som Parkash was contesting.

 Sampla had strongly opposed ticket to Som Parkash. Even other local leaders from Phagwara had spoken out against Som Parkash, and a BJP leader had even complained about it to party president Amit Shah after the election.
 
 Sampla wanted ticket for former SAD MLA Mohan Lal, whose father Swarna Ram was a BJP MLA from Phagwara and a minister in SAD-BJP government twice. After the contention on Phagwara seat, rumours of Sampla’s resignation also spread, which he denied them before meeting party chief Shah in Delhi.
 
 Parkash won by defeating Joginder Singh Mann of the Congress with a margin of 2,009 votes. 
 
 BJP has won from Sujanpur, Abohar and Phagwara constituencies and its tally has come down from 12 to 3 seats.
