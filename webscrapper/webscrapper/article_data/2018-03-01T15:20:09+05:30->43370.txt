Pune: Green activists here are up in arms against the state’s decision to delete the   of a portion of land in the Salim Ali Bird   located in the Yerawada area. 
 
 Satish Khot of National Society for Clean Cities said he has approached PM Narendra Modi and CM Devendra Fadnavis on the issue, claiming that the part   of reservation would be a threat to the city’s green cover. 
  
 “It was shocking to learn that reservation of part of the sanctuary was deleted. The move has paved way for builders to make the land concrete. We will move court against the decision,” Khot said. 
  
 Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials confirmed that the reservation on the plot at the   sanctuary has been changed. They said the changes were made at the state level. 
  
 City engineer Prashant Waghmare said the civic body has so far not received any proposal of construction on the plot in the santuary. 
  
 A notification issued by the state government on February 17 pertaining to the excluded part of development plan states: “Part of land from F.P.No. 70/12 along with F.P.No70/13 is deleted from the reservation. PK-14 reservation is to be continued on remaining land.” 
  
 The officials said the PMC’s final draft of development plan had maintained reservation of the park (PK) on the disputed land.
