PATNA: A farmer from Bihar, Krishna   alias Kisan (68), received the prestigious innovative farmer award at   2017 in the national capital on Saturday. Singh, who hails from Sheikhpura, joined farm work at a very young age of 15 when his father bought a tractor in the mid-1960s to improve the farm yield. He is the only farmer from Bihar to get the award.

 Singh, who received the award for cultivating the newer varieties of ‘khesari’ crop, a legume for human and animal consumption, said, “It took me over 10 years to cultivate the newer varieties of   with the help of biotechnologists and modern ways of farming. Despite many farmers discarding the ‘khesari’ crop, I took up the challenge and cultivated 3,200 kg of ‘khesari’ in four acres of land last year. The crop requires very little water and fetches good price in the market.”
 
 Singh, who returned from Delhi on Sunday, added, “I employ   in the fields for high yield. A farmer should always take part in   organized by the government and non-governmental organizations to improve his knowledge.” He attributed his success to various training programmes organised by different organisations across the country. 
 
 The farmer, who uses smartphone to keep himself updated with latest developments in agriculture around the globe, said, “Farming should be done as per the demand of the market conditions. Knowledge and education is key for better yields. Middlemen should be avoided as they exploit and mislead the farmers.”
