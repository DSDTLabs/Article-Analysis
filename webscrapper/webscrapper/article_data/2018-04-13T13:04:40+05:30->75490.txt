NEW DELHI: To boost inflows of foreign funds into Indian capital markets, regulator   has decided to raise the investment limit for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in central government securities and corporate bonds in two tranches. 

 It has been decided to enhance limit for investment by FPIs in two tranches from April 12 and October 1. 
 
 The move is part of an effort by   (Sebi) to push inflow from overseas investors in the country's capital markets. 
 
 "Limit for FPIs in central government securities shall be enhanced to Rs 2,07,300 crore on April 12 and Rs 2,23,300 crore on October 1, respectively," the regulator said in a circular.

This will be further increased to Rs 92,300 crore on October 1. Earlier, the existing limit was Rs 44,100 crore for long term FPIs. 
 
 "The sub-limit for investment by long term FPIs in the infrastructure sector shall be done away with and the existing investment and free limits shall be merged into the corporate debt investment limits.
