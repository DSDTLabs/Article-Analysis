SMC authorities suspended   and  , both senior swimming instructors, and  , a junior swimming instructor, at the pool. Naina Sarang, a junior instructor, was issued a show cause notice by them.

 Family members alleged that Om was taken to the hospital by a security guard, who escaped once the body was taken inside. The body was sent for postmortem. Preliminary examination attributed drowning to be the cause of the teenager’s death. 
 
 Family members were told by swimming pool authorities that Om had jumped into deep waters after everyone had come out of the pool around 11 am. No buoy was found tied to his body when it is compulsory for all students who are learning swimming. Om had started training at the swimming pool only four days ago. He was part of learners’ batch that had around 188 students. They were being trained in shallow waters and so he was not supposed to do swimming in deep waters. 
 
 The deceased’s family members have demanded strict action against the instructors at the swimming pool. They refused to take the teenager’s body for cremation from the postmortem room. 
 
 Om’s father Jignesh is an accountant in a private industry in Udhna. Om had recently appeared in class X examinations. His elder sister Meghna is slated to get married in December. Om was a student of Sanskar Sarita School.
