Under this effect, there would be light rains and thunder showers over the city in the evenings," said Dr Y K Reddy, director (in-charge) of   Hyderabad.
 
 Officials at   said the city could experience light rain and thundershowers during the late evenings accompanied by squally winds. In the wake of the sudden summers showers, a thick cloud cover could provide some respite for people.
