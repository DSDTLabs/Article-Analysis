Navi Mumbai: The   ( )   team, led by civic chief  , cleared many encroachments throughout the node during a surprise drive late Sunday night. The demolition drive continued till Monday morning.

 The team freed the illegally occupied roads, footpaths and public spaces without any protest, as the drive was a sudden move by PCMC to avert backlash from encroachers backed by politicians.
 
 Shinde told TOI that they initiated action beyond the usual office hours in a bid to adapt as per timing of people who break the law. “It’s our earnest effort to make footpaths and public spaces free of encroachment. More such unusual drives are on cards,” he added.
 
 But Cidco officials were clueless about the drive. “Being the municipal authority, we have every right to initiate action against encroachment by hawkers, shopkeepers and residents,” said  , PCMC Deputy Municipal Commissioner.
