SECUNDERABAD: The   (SCB) has decided to crack the whip against illegal flexis and banners displayed by politicians in the Cantonment area. The   wants to follow in the footsteps of the   ( ), which has been removing banners and flexis from public places for the past few months. 

 The issue cropped up during the visit of minister for municipal administration   to Cantonment to inaugurate a bridge across a culvert. The minister suggested that SCB chief executive officer SVR   make the cantonment free of illegal posters and banners. KTR noticed flexis and banners set up by local leaders to welcome him. The minister immediately asked the CEO to remove the flexis welcoming him on both sides of the main road.
 
 There are eight civilian wards in Secunderabad cantonment, and the ward representatives set up welcome banners. They also set up flexis and banners during Sankranti, Bathukamma, Deepavali, Dasera, Christmas and Ramadan greeting people. The banners have not removed after the festivals. The SCB does not have any specific guidelines on banners, though they cause inconvenience to road users. 
 
 "It is true that KTR has asked us to act tough against illegal flexis and banners. Already, we have formed special teams in the SCB sanitation wing to remove them. We will intensify the drive and remove all the illegal flexis and banners. A meeting with SCB officials will be held soon to chalk out the drive," SCB chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar told TOI. 
 
 He said the board will also impose penalties on the violators. The fine may range between 500 and 5,000, said the SCB official.
