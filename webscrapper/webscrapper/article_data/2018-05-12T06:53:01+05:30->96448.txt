BENGALURU: The   (SIT), that had detained a second suspect in the   this week, will now approach their counterparts in Maharashtra to take the probe forward.

 
 Eight months after   Gauri was murdered, the SIT had arrested 37-year-old K T Naveen Kumar, a gunrunner, in March, accusing him of being directly involved in the killing apart from sheltering other members of the team.
 
 Now, they plan to liaise with the SIT team in Maharashtra that is probing the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar.
 
 “We strongly suspect the man who we detained earlier this week has strong links with social organizations from Maharashtra,” SIT sources said. “The Maharashtra SIT team will throw more light on the suspect and his activities. We have already spoken to senior officials in Maharashtra.”
 
 Sleuths suspect Gauri’s killers belong to the same group that was involved in the murders of Dabholkar in Pune in 2013, scholar MM   and CPI leader Govind Pansare in Kolhapur in 2015. They claim ballistics examination confirmed that the same weapon was used in all four killings.
