THANE: The   has remanded BJP corporator   from   to   till next Thursday.

 Mahesh Patil and his two aides with Sujit Nalawade and Vijay aka Valya Bakade were arrested on Friday and were produced in the sessions court in Kalyan. He is accused of giving the contract of eliminating another corporator Kunal Patil from Dombivli, said RV Kothmire, the investigation officer. 
 
 The police in their submission told the court that it is mandatory to interrogate the trio along with seven others for hatching the plan to kill Kunal Patil. "we want to question them face to face and connect the dots in the case," Kothmire informed.
 
 The officer pointed out that two shar shooters hired by Mahesh Patil are still absconding and they want to nab them. They are identified as Rajesh Patel and Rahul Singh, both from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. Also, it is yet to be interrogate the procurement and source of weapons and money used for the planning.
 
 On the other hand the defence counsel strongly contended that the case is fake and that the some news channels already broke the story of Mahesh Patilâ€™s involvement before the case was registered. 
 
 The judge after hearing both the sides remanded the trio in police custody if anti extortion cell. 
 
 Some of the aides of Mahesh Patil were arrested in December last year by Thane rural police for robbery but it later transpired that it was Mahesh who had given him the contract to eliminate Kunal and recovered a pistol, a revolver, two country-made revolvers, 10 live cartridges and Rs 3 lakh from the robbers. Subsequently, the case was then transferred to the Manpada police and then to the Anti Extortion Cell.
