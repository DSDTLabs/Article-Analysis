HYDERABAD: Thanks to the   of directorate of treasuries and accounts' website, users are taking more time to fill the salary requests via online than they do through the manual process.
The head masters of various schools said that work which should be completed in 30 minutes was taking up to three days due to one or the other technical glitches.
 
 “Starting from June, the situation has gone from bad to worse. Last month itself, I had to spend about four days to apply for the bills. Even then, I could only file salary bill and the arrears' bill is still pending,“ said S Ramanandaiah, principal, Government High School, Sabzi Mandi II, Jiyaguda.
 
 He said that the software and server used in local super markets were better than the ones used in the treasury department and opined that it's high time the government made the website better.
 
 “The treasury website is used by scores of people, but the standard maintained is worse than the any local small vendors. Every time we have to fill all the details manually and every now and then the server crashes.It's high time they came up with a better websitesite which would enable us to file bills just at a click,“ said  , a principal of another government school in the city.
 
 The headmaster said that although calculations were made easier by going online, there was no option to modify the existing records while filling the bills. “When we used to do the billing manually, we used to copy the earlier bill and would change only the details of the ones who got arrears, but in the online system, we have no such option. We have to enter everything manually,“ said M  , adding that they were still forced to file supplementary bills manually as the online process could not support these bills.
 
 They said that the government should make the site better if they want all the employees of various departments to use the site and rectify the servers so that it won't take ages to file the bills.
