Vadodara: Food safety officers of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) continued their crackdown on vendors selling   or sugarcane juice and other food items consumed widely during summer.

 Teams of the civic body checked seven vendors in the Parshuram Bhattha, Akota, Harinagar and Gotri areas of the city. These included three selling mango juice and four selling sugarcane juice.
 
 The teams destroyed 62kg material including 40kg mango juice, two kilogram fruits and 20kg ice. Officials said that these were not found fit for consumption or were in an unhygienic condition. The teams also collected one food sample from these establishments. The sample will be analysed at VMCâ€™s public health laboratory.
 
 Officials added that two vendors did not have food licences and were issued notices in this regard. TNN
