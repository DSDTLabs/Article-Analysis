BHOPAL: A Class VII girl who asked for a glass of water at a restaurant in MP’s Sagar was confined in a room and raped all night a week ago. Shocked into silence, she could tell her parents only last Wednesday, leading to the suspect’s arrest on Thursday afternoon.

 According to the complaint, the 14-year-old had left home in a huff on the evening of February 24 after being scolded by her mother for not being serious about her final exams due in March. 
 
 She wandered off towards Makronia, a well known residential suburb of Sagar city. She was passing by a restaurant when she realized she was thirsty and asked for water. Vicky Rajput, owner of the small restaurant, asked a worker to give her a glass of water, police said.
 
 Vicky then approached the girl and asked why she was upset. He told her not to worry as he knows her mama (maternal uncle) and would soon call him so that he can come and take her home. The child did not want to trudge back all the way and decided to wait.
 
 Around 9.30pm, Vicky returned to the restaurant and took the girl into a room where he allegedly raped.
 
 
 
 
 The girls said that he “allowed her to leave” the restaurant at around 5am on February 25, Makronia police said.
 
 By then, her parents had filed a missing person’s complaint. They were relieved when she returned home, but grew increasingly concerned at her silence. SP Satyandra Shukla told media that the girl was so shocked that for more than two days, she did not speak about the incident.
 
 On Tuesday night, she told her parents, who went to police and the FIR was filed early Wednesday morning. Vicky was arrested on Thursday and charged under POCSO for rape.
