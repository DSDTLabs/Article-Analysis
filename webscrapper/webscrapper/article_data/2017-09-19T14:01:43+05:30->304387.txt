CHENNAI: Without the knowledge of the   (SEC), the Tamil Nadu government has abolished wards in panchayats and city municipal corporations, making it practically impossible for the poll body to notify the civic elections before September 18, as directed by the Madras high court.

 “The government has passed amendments to Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act and other municipal corporations acts on September 3. Through the amendment, sections 28A, 28AA, and 28AAA of the act have been repealed. What remains is only section 28 which mandates that elections should be held only after delimitation of wards based on the latest census and providing due reservations,” commissioner of SEC M Malik Feroze Khan said through a miscellaneous plea.
 
 The SEC was unaware of the September 3 amendment when the high court passed the order on September 4, Khan said, referring to the order asking the SEC to complete the election by November 17.
 
 Now, in view of the amendment made to the acts, the SEC perceives that there is a legal disability in conducting the election as in law there exist no wards, he said.
 
 Under the changed legal position, the SEC has moved the Supreme Court for a suitable direction, he said, adding that despite the commission’s best efforts, the matter could not be brought for hearing in the apex court.
 
 The commissioner then urged the high court to modify its order or keep it in abeyance till the apex court passes suitable directions. The application moved by the SEC exactly on the cut-off day fixed by the high court is likely to be taken up for hearing by the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and M   on Tuesday.
