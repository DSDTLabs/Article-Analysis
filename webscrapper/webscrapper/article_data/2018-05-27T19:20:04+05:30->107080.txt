NEW DELHI:   Delhi has approached the high court opposing the naming rights of a   near the institute being acquired by a coaching institute.

 The premier engineering college wants   to either revoke the permission granted to   or remove the name of an upcoming metro station at the   (SDA).
 
 On Friday, Justice Rajiv Shakdher sought a response from DMRC and FIITJEE seeking their response to the grievance raised by the engineering college. IIT has argued that it is concerned about the branding of the IIT metro station as FIITJEE as it sends a misleading impression as if the institute is in some kind of partnership with the coaching centre.
 
 Given that it is the IITs that hold and conduct the Joint Entrance Examination ( ) for which the private study centre FIITJEE provides coaching, the naming of IIT metro station as FIITJEE has made many alumni and aspiring candidates believe that the institute has endorsed FIITJEE as an official coaching partner.
 
 Disturbed by the naming rights going to a coaching centre, IIT Delhi has earlier also taken up the issue with central government, through the ministries of Human Resource Development and that of Housing and Urban Affairs, but to little avail since its plea failed to elicit a positive response.
