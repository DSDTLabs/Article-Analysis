Blessed with a mellifluous voice, Mysuru-born singer Vijay Prakash’s illustrious career is dotted with several memorable songs — not just in  , but also in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. Trained in Carnatic  , the singer has worked with many celebrated musicians, including Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman, while he has also won awards for a number of his vocal gems. Cut to the latest, Vijay has just picked the best playback singer trophy for the song 
  in the recently-released Kannada film 
  at a prestigious   function. This particular track from 
  and the song 
  from the recently-released Puneeth Rajkumar movie have caused waves on the internet, with the music videos going viral on popular sites.

  So, how does it feel to have two back-to-back hits? “It’s quite amazing to know that your songs are reaching out to so many people, and they are liking them. I am thankful to B Ajaneesh Loknath and V Harikrishna for coming up with such heart-stirring numbers,” he says.
 
  When asked what he thinks about the role of social media in making music popular in today’s world, the seasoned vocalist says, “Social media can help showcase your work to a larger audience on the web. But, I feel that connecting with people on a personal level still works better in spreading the word. And if it’s a good piece of work, it’ll strike a chord with the audience, no matter what,” explains the singer, who also hosts music reality shows on TV. 
 
  The singer, who often travels around the world with his music, describes award functions as a great opportunity to meet and greet old friends and colleagues, as well make new memories. Vijay has also been associated with the   Indian Ensemble through Ananthaal — a musical collaboration between singer-producer Clinton Cerejo and himself. He describes it as a “proud and inspiring” experience. According to him, life is a celebration of musical notes.
