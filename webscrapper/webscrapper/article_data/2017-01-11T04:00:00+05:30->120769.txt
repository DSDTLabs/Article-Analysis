Vadodara: While the MS University (MSU) talks about making its entire campus Wi-Fi enabled, it had to face a major embarrassment on Tuesday.

 Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, who is in city to interact with and address students of MSU today, was to stay at the university’s guesthouse. But at the last minute, he had to be shifted to a private hotel in Sayajigunj as the MSU guesthouse did not have Wi-Fi facility.
 
 Sources at the hotel have confirmed that the structural biologist is staying at the hotel and has even taken a Wi-Fi card for his use. When contacted, science faculty dean, A C Sharma refused to give any details about Venky’s stay in the city. “He is in Gujarat as a part of Vibrant Gujarat Summit and will be addressing the students as a part of government’s initiative, but where he is staying is a confidential thing,” said Sharma.
 
 On Tuesday, Venky made a surprise visit to the Vikram Sarabhai Science Block’s laboratory in the DN Hall campus. On Wednesday, he will interact with students at CC Mehta Auditorium from 3 pm to 3.45 pm and at 4 pm he will deliver a lecture on ‘100 years of Visualizing Molecules’ at the same auditorium.
 
 Sharma said that all nine Noble laureates, who were in the state to take part in Vibrant Gujarat Summit’s Noble Dialogue programme, will deliver a lecture in educational institutions as a part of the state government’s initiative.
