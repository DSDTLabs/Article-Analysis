Vadodara: The ghaats of Vishwamitri River near Kala Ghoda bridge wore a festive look after being illuminated on Tuesday evening. 

 Nature lovers from the city celebrated Mahashivaratri by lighting earthen lamps on the banks of Vishwamitri. They also took an oath to protect the river and ensure that is revived in the future. The Nature Walk group, an informal group of nature lovers, had organized the ceremony to bring awareness about the river’s condition. 
 
 “We have been raising the issue of conserving the river that is the lifeline of the city. Some weeks ago, the authorities also dumped debris on the river bank near Yavteshwar Temple. Our aim was to make citizens aware of importance of this river. So we organized this event on the river bank to celebrate Mahashivaratri,” said Dr Jitendra Gavali, member of the nature walk group. 
 
 The members cleaned the historic ghaats over last two days and then painted the walls with Warli paintinngs. This ghaat is home to Lord Shiva Temple and some heritage structures. “We asked the participants to take an oath to protect the river and work for its revival. Also, promise was taken from them to never pollute this river,” said Arun Mujumdar, another member of the group. After the oath taking ceremony, the members lit earthen lamps on the ghaats. 
 
 “We pass from the river many times but never knew about its importance. After attending the event on Tuesday, we learnt how this river is lifeline of the city and the rich biodiversity it offers,” said Shubhangi Manohar, one of the participants. The group also plans to organize more such activities for protecting the river that is home to hundreds of crocodiles.
