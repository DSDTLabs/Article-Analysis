Thiruvananthapuram: Health minister   has come down heavily against the campaign to tarnish the image of the   ( ), the premier hospital offering advanced treatment to cancer. She said that those with vested interests, who want to help the private hospital lobby, are behind the campaign. 

 “The RCC is catering to lakhs of cancer patients across the state and such malicious campaigns will only destroy a world-class centre offering quality treatment,” the minister said.
 
 She said that there were isolated incidents but those were being blown out of proportion to tarnish the image of the hospital. 
 
 “After the unfortunate incident that had led to the death of a nine-year-old girl who was under treatment for leukaemia, it was used as a campaign against the hospital. But all the tests had proved that it was not the fault of RCC. The hospital authorities had conducted repeat blood tests of the people who donated blood during that period. But a donor who was HIV positive could not be detected,” said the minister.
 
 It is a fact that there is no procedure in the country to find out the HIV positive cases during the window period, the minister added.
 
 Meanwhile, RCC director Dr Paul Sebastian also came out with a statement condemning the malicious campaign. “The hospital has adopted the WHO and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) standards for the blood screening. It is also scientifically proven that all these tests cannot find out HIV positive cases during the window period. Even the latest tests like NAT cannot give exact results,” he said.
