HYDERABAD:   (PETA) India on Tuesday accused several hatcheries and farms in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana of adopting cruel methods to kill just born   in their thousands everyday.   representatives showed reporters videos of such chicks being killed and said the tiny males are burnt alive, drowned in bins full of water and crushed in large grinders while still alive. Male chicks are considered useless to the egg industry and are hence are discarded, they said.

 According to PETA India spokesperson  , nearly all the top companies in the   in the two states follow these methods to get rid of unwanted chicks.
 
 He said PETA meanwhile has also written to the agriculture ministers at the state and central levels and animal husbandry departments to intervene in the matter. “We are demanding that the Centre mandate poultry companies to start researching in-ovo sexing technology which can be used to determine the sex of the chick so that the eggs, identified as carrying males can be discarded before they develop into embryos and a complete nervous system. Till the time such technology is made viable, we are asking that policy level interventions be made to adopt the least cruel method of discarding the male chicks,” added Sharma. Among the least cruel ways available are injecting chicks to a painless death.
