LUCKNOW: At several places across the city, water has been leaking from pipelines for more than 20 days but   has not fixed it despite many localities facing scant supply. 

 It is well-known that of the total amount of water generated in the city, almost 35% goes waste in leakages, which is a big reason for supply shortage.
 
 Even then, Jal Sansthan has not taken cognisance of major leakages reported from different parts of the city. 
 
 In sector K of  , water has been leaking on the main road for several days. The supply line has developed cracks, yielding several litres of water on the road every day. 
 
 AB Singh, a resident, said, "After several complaints, when Jal Sansthan officials turned up, they avoided fixing the problem, saying that since leakage is not in the main pipeline, residents will have to pay from their own pocket. This is a forced way to take money from locals who are already paying taxes to the corporation."
 
 Near   crossing, several litres of water is being wasted daily. 
 
 Despite the leakage in front of a major market, no engineer has taken cognisance. Shopkeepers have complained repeatedly but the leakage has not been fixed. 
 
  of  , near  , has been complaining of sewerage-mixed supply for about a month but to no avail. 
 
 "Because of the leakage in the main pipeline, the water attracts sand and sewerage flowing in nearby pipelines. We have been receiving contaminated and stinking water supply for more than a month. They have not even responded to my complaint to the control room."
 
 Jal Sansthan officials said they would launch an investigation into the case and fix accountability of local engineers who have been avoiding the issue.
