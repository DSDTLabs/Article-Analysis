AHMEDABAD: The   government has raised the   (VAT) on alcohol to 65%. Earlier, VAT was 60% and 2.5%   was levied. 

 Seven items — diesel, petrol, petroleum crude, duty-paid aviation turbine fuel, branded aviation turbine fuel, natural gas, and alcohol — have remained within the purview of the state government. 
 
 Of the seven categories, the government has increased VAT on alcohol alone. 
 
 “The rate of VAT on high-speed diesel will be 24 paise per rupee, and 26 paise per rupee for motor spirit (commonly known as petrol),” says the Gujarat Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill-2017. “The rate of Value Added Tax will be 5 paise per rupee on petroleum crude, 30 paise per rupee on duty-free aviation turbine fuel and 38 paise per rupee on bonded aviation turbine fuel (fuel stored in warehouses). 
 
 Fifteen paise per rupee will be the VAT on natural gas and 65 paise per rupee will be levied as VAT on alcoholic liquor for human consumption.” 
 
 Four percent cess will be levied on petrol and diesel, a top VAT official said. Officials said that the state government has kept Value Added Taxunchanged for all goods except alcohol. 
 
 However, cess of 4% will continue to be levied on petrol and diesel. “Earlier, Value Added Taxon natural gas was 12.5% with additional cess of 2.5%; it will be 15% in the new VAT structure. So the total tax will remain the same,” the official said. 
 
 “There is an increase of 2.5% in VAT for liquor only.”
 
 Gujarat has been a prohibition state since its formation in 1960 and only permit holders can buy liquor from licensed shops.
