KOLKATA: CBI has registered a case against "unknown officials" of the United Bank of India, Metiabruz branch while probing the alleged role of a section of bank officials in laundering money after the   announcement was made on November 8. The central agency has already completed the preliminary probe. 

 According to CBI sources, the agency started initial probe into the Metiaburuz Jan Dhan account case earlier last month in which the role of some bank officials was traced. "A case has been registered already against unknown officials of the United Bank of India. We will start a probe now," said a CBI official. The case came to fore after deposits worth Rs 6.6 crore was found in eight Jan Dhan accounts after November 8.
 
 During initial probe, CBI officers found that signatures of several innocent account holders of UBI were forged. The central agency believes that huge amount of money can't be deposited in the accounts of innocent persons without the help of bank officials.
 
 It was found that Rs 6.6 crore was deposited on November 19 in nine accounts of the Metiaburuz resident woman's family. Of the nine accounts, eight were Jan Dhan accounts, the agency found. It was also found that an account, which has been lying dormant since 1988, was suddenly made active and large amounts had been deposited there.
 
 What surprised the CBI investigators was how the bank officials continued to help fraudsters over the past several years. There were instances when money was withdrawn from accounts whose holders can't be traced. There were also instances when dormant accounts were allegedly used to shift money from one account to another forging signatures.
 
 Meanwhile, ED officials have interrogated ten persons in the case in which the agency has also found gross anomalies. The bank's MD and CEO Pawan Kumar Bajaj said that he is outside and will be able to comment on the issue once he is back. "I will be in a position to comment on it after I join office," he said.
