PUDUCHERRY: The government has issued notice to three   affiliated to deemed universities in the Union territory warning them of legal action if found collecting more than Rs 10 lakh as annual fees from the   medical students.

 Deputy secretary (health) R Chandrasekaran sought the colleges to comply with the Supreme Court’s direction and collect only Rs 10 lakh as annual fees from the students for the academic year 2017-18 and 2018-19 until the   decides on the fee structure. 
 
 He warned that violations by the colleges will be treated as ‘wilful’ and the government and other appropriate authorities will initiate legal action against them. The notices were issued to Mahatma Gandhi Medical   and Research Institute (MGMC & RI), Aarupadai Veedu Medical College and Hospital, and Vinayaga Mission’s Medical College and Hospital.
 
 The government rejected the MGMC & RI’s argument that the fees of Rs 10 lakh per annum fixed by the   will be applicable only to the students admitted to colleges between June 16 and 19 last year and for the academic year 2017-18 only.
 
 Chandrasekaran pointed out that the Supreme Court declared that fees fixed by the Madras HC ‘will hold good’ till the high court decides the matter. He added that the high court did not order that only students admitted between June 16 and 19 last year will be entitled to the benefit of interim fees. The high court had also declared that the students who had already taken admission by paying fees more than Rs 10 lakh will, if necessary, be entitled to refund/adjustment of the differences in fees.
 
 “So it is clear that all the students whether under government quota or management quota who had already been admitted to the PG courses in the deemed to be universities are eligible/bound to pay only Rs 10 lakh during this academic year also,” he said.
