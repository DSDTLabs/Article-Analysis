NAVI MUMBAI: Two of the four   ( ) at   have stopped functioning since the last two days.   complained that they have to stand in queues under the scorching sun for 15 to 20 minutes to buy tickets. They also alleged that the authorities have paid no heed to repeated complaints.

  “It’s been two days since the machines stopped working but the authorities are yet to take action. This lax attitude is uncalled for,” said a collegian Vasant Shetty. 
 
 A   official countered that they have summoned the technical team to check the snag in two machines.
 
 But commuters are not ready to listen as many claim that they miss their trains as they have to stand in queues to buy tickets. “We are not concerned about the official excuses. It’s their headache to get the devices repaired. Why do we have to suffer,” asked a commuter, Kushal Kolte. 
 
 The commuter complained that two ticket counters are falling short to cater to the heavy rush. They also blamed the authorities for not opening additional windows to handle the crowd. 
 
 Another commuter Shrish Naik said that more counters should be opened to handle the commuters, who now have to stand in long queues. 
 
 Many also alleged that this is not the first time that the machines have stopped working. Commuters have also complained that the ATVMs’ touchscreens are not functioning properly.
 
 A railway official said, “We have taken note of the problems and the service lapse will be attended soon.”
