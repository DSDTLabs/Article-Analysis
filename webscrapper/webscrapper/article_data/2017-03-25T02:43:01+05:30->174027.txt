GURUGRAM: The length of the proposed   road on the Gurgaon-Alwar   has been extended by 6km, all the way up to  . 

 This road is to start at   on NH-8 and will help motorists get to Sohna, about 23km away, in far quicker time than they do now. 
 
 The changes were made following a recent order by the Union ministry of road transport and highways. According to the previous plan, the elevated road was to go only till Alipur near Bhondsi. A senior   official told TOI, “This has now been extended for another 6 km, and will now go beyond Sohna. It will give a big breather to commuters going from Rajiv Chowk to Sohna rural.”
 
 The number of lanes proposed along the stretch has also been increased. From the earlier plan to make four lanes, the elevated road is now proposed to be a 6-lane stretch. “NHAI is making necessary changes in its detailed project report to accommodate the changes, after they received an order from the ministry last week,” added the official.
 
 In August last year, NHAI had declared the stretch from Rajiv Chowk till Naugaon at the Haryana-Rajasthan border a national highway. The length of the stretch is 95 km. The move will especially benefit sectors 33, 66, 67, Jharsa, Islampur, Fazilpur, Badshapur, Bhondsi and Sohna. Sohna road is a part of Sohna-Alwar highway, an important route for Rajasthan and Haryana over which around 50,000 vehicles travel every day. It is also used for transportation of dairy products for Gurgaon and Delhi. The elevated road project is expected to start by August this year.
