NEW DELHI:   leaders from Punjab slammed   chief Arvind   for apologising to Akali Dal leader Bikram Majithia for accusing him of being involved in drugs trade, with many wondering if the allegations were part of a conspiracy to divide anti-incumbency votes in the state at the instance of the Badal family.

 Punjab Congress chief and Lok Sabha MP Sunil Jakhar said Kejriwal should apologise to the people of Punjab and not Majithia. "It means there was a nexus between him and Akalis to divide the anti-incumbency, anti-drugs votes to damage Congress. That is why he went overboard with his remarks in the election campaign. His   has exposed him badly."
 
  MP and former state Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa said the apology was bizarre since the SIT probe into the issue was pending.
 
 Ironically, the apology did not win the Delhi CM the support of Akali Dal.
 
 Union minister and SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, "A classic example of a smear campaign run by them (AAP) in Delhi and Punjab by spreading false propaganda. They built the entire momentum of their election campaign (in Punjab) on lies... he (Kejriwal) stands thoroughly exposed."
