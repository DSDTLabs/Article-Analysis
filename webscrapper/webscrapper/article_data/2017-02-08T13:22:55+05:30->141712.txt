PANAJI: Rajya Sabha MP   questioned the statement by defence minister   who had attacked the government of India on its time-tested policy of ‘No First Use policy” on  .

 Naik, making his zero hour submissions on Tuesday, said the defence minister, at the launch of (Retd) Brig Gurmeet Kanwal’s book, ‘The New Arthashastra: A security strategy for India’, had said, “I wonder why we say that we don’t use nuclear weapons first.”
 
 Parrikar had further said, “It doesn’t mean that India has to use nukes, but why rule it out?”
 
 If India proposes to alter the policy on the use of nuclear strike, the defence minister has to put his proposal before the Union cabinet, Naik said.
