PATNA: Nalanda boy  , who graduated in   from   (NIT)-Patna in 2016, has secured first rank in the country in architecture and planning in the   (GATE) examinations, the results of which were declared on Friday. Anup scored 79.33 marks out of 100.

 Twenty-three-year-old Anup, who topped the list in his third attempt, said it’s indeed a proud moment for him and his family. The boy works for Studio Parametric Architects, a Bangalore-based architectural firm.
 
 Born to a schoolteacher Anil Kumar and homemaker Archana Sinha, Anup wants to pursue his further higher studies in Masters in City Planning from   (IIT). Anup’s younger sister Anupama is pursuing BSc-BEd integrated course in Delhi and his elder sister Anu works as a teacher in Patna.
 
 “I got 402nd rank in my second attempt in 2017. The ranking was not good enough to get admission in IITs. So I attempted again and my hard work has paid off this time. I devoted two hours after work for the preparation of GATE examination. It was hectic for me. However, I somehow managed. During my preparations, I focused on both concepts and problems as the exam requires command over both of them,” he said.
 
 “I want to work with the firms which acknowledge my work, while people at large will know the significance of my work,” Anup told this reporter over phone from Bangalore. He added, “My parents never forced me to prepare for exams. Rather, they provided me with the freedom to pursue my interests.”
