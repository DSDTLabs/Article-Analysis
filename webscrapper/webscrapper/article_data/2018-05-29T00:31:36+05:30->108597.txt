Coimbatore: Parents of a 12-year-old boy with learning disability petitioned the collector on Monday seeking action against their neighbours,  

 “They burnt my son’s face. When I confronted them, they replied arrogantly,” the boy’s mother, S Periyamuthu of Theppakulam, said. 
 
 “Those staying in the front portion of our rented house had been causing trouble with the intent of making us vacate the house. We have been living there for a year,” she said. 
 
 Police failed to act even though they filed a compliant against the offenders, the mother said. “Police asked us to settle the issue amicably,” she added. TNN
