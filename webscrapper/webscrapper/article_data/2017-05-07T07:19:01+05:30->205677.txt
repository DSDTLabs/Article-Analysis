THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM general secretary Sitaram   said India needed a President who is committed to secularism and efforts were on to identify a common candidate, who can be fielded by opposition parties in the forthcoming president election. 

 "We need a president who has impeccable commitment to secularism. The core question is whether we need a communal supervision of our Constitution or a secular one," he said, after he deplaned at the airport in the capital. Yechury was in Thiruvananthapuram to inaugurate a course - 'Contemporary India - challenges and opportunities'-offered by EMS Academy. Yechury said the president should be selected based on his political views. When asked about the BJP fielding a tribal candidate for the post, Yechury said identity was not a criterion for the post. "The commitment of the candidate to secularism is more important," he said.
 
 The new president will be selected during June-July period as incumbent president   will remit office on July 25, 2017. AICC president Sonia Gandhi had already begun discussion with leaders of other national parities, including Yechury, to ensure a larger alliance in this case. 
 
 It is learnt that she will convene a meeting of opposition parties later this month to formalize the decision. With BJP registering a thumping win in UP, the opposition can upset BJP only if all regional and national parties outside the   stand together.
