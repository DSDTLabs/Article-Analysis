Popular actor   is currently playing the loveable robot of Indian television in the show YARO, and recently he tried something new and unique on screen. One of the sequences on the show required him to dress up as a joker. And   was overjoyed to know that he will be playing a clown.
 
  
 
  
  Speaking on that he says,"I really don't know that how many of you know this fact- that to play a "clown" is my dream role. For an actor, it's a great victory if he gets the role which he's ever dreamt of. Joker is my favourite role. No other character can be so rich in terms of variants of emotions. I wanted to give soul to a clown someday. Today I am so happy that it was a small montage that I played."
  
  Aniruddh further adds," I really feel that whatever happens, happened or fear of oncoming happening may realise you the best of the capability of your craft. No need to go far from you. I observe myself. That gives me oodles of confidence to play that role honestly. There are times actually you feel and find a lot of examples around you. You add some ingredients and you emote that can be more believable." Aniruddh hats off to you, you definitely has a good vision in the craft and a long way to go."
  
    hopes to get into the character of a clown again so that he can polish his acting skills even more.
