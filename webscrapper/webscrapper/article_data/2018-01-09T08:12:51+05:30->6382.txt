AMRITSAR: Life of   and his wife Bhagwanti Devi is nothing short of old Bollywood flicks that showcased bonded labour where a father borrows a small amount from a landlord to sustain and his entire family ends up working for the landlord to repay the loan and the interest that never gets paid. 

 Mohan Lal had borrowed Rs 5,000 from a landlord in Gurdaspur district in 1987 before his loan was transferred to another landlord in 1992. Not only did they work in the kilns for years, their sons Hardeep and Sonu were also born and brought up in makeshift dwellings of the kiln.
 
 Hailing from Ramgarh town of Sikkar district in Rajasthan, Mohan Lal, 58, told TOI on Monday that with the help of one of his acquaintance Nath Ram, he borrowed Rs 5,000 and started working in a brick kiln in   in Gurdaspur district.
 
 Five years later, he was informed that the loan was transferred to owner of another brick kiln in Warsola village, and since then he along with his wife and sons had been working as labourers. "After working for all these years, the brick kiln owner is asking us to pay back Rs 70,000," he alleged.
 
 Jai Singh, general secretary, Volunteers for Social Justice (VSJ) said after rescuing the family from a brick kiln, they have arranged for their rehabilitation in Phillaur.
 
 VSJ legal associate   said following their complaint against a brick kiln owner, the Gurdaspur administration had constituted a team and rescued them from the brick kiln on December 29th. "Since then they are living at our rehabilitation centre," he said.
 
 "We could have freed myself from this captivity years ago but neither we had enough courage nor the whole family was allowed to leave the brick kiln at one time," said Bhagwanti Devi, adding that during days of 'slavery' she gave birth to three children.
 
 Hardeep, son of Mohan Lal, alleged, "The brick kiln owners passed castiest remarks and used to object to him going to college or wearing good clothes."
