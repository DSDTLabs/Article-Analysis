AMARAVATI: With very little time at its disposal,   knocked the Centre's door on Thursday, seeking extension of powers of President of India granted under the AP Reorganisation Act to resolve the contentious issues with neighbour Telangana. 

 In a letter dashed off to Union home secretary  , chief secretary Dinesh   urged him to take steps to grant extension to section 108 of the Reorganisation Act as the section will cease to be in operation in the next few days. The CS brought to the home secretary's notice that section 108 has a lifespan of three years and would expire on June 1. 
 
 "Since several issues between the two Telugu states are yet to be resolved, there is an urgent need to keep the President's powers to intervene and settle matters of importance. Hence, I request you to take steps to grant extension of section 108 of the Act at least by two more years," explained the chief secretary.
