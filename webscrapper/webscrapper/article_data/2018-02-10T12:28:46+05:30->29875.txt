 However, the verdict is unlikely to seal the fate of the case as it has given powers to   and the government to take appropriate action if necessary. Though it dismissed the vigilance case, the court hasn’t struck down the case related to the land encroachment. The encroachment case has been pending with the Lok Ayukta and as per the latest records submitted by the petitioners, the extent of land encroached by the builder will be much more thanthe12centswhichwas already claimed by the KWA.
