Imagine the stage as a canvas, colours as props and babies as actors along with their parents. What rounds off is an engaging performance about the joys and burdens of parenthood. Bengaluru-based collective, Organizational  , has come up with a unique venture, called 
 .

  “It is primarily a physical theatre workshop that aims at helping young parents in the city, particularly mothers, to unburden themselves from the various problems they face in their journey into becoming parents, and the issues they go through after the baby is born. From postpartum depression to the notion that they can no longer go about doing things that they like are some of the factors addressed in the workshop. We are involving both fathers and mothers, as well as their babies in this initiative. It’s about sharing their stories, breaking myths, becoming emotionally strong and getting more creatively engaged,” says theatreperson  , who is spearheading the project.
 
  According to Almas — who is also a mother to nine-month-old Alyrah — the workshop will culminate in a play, titled 
 . “It will serve as a platform for parents to tell the audience their stories, while the latter can also express their views. It will be a dissolve theatre performance, in which mothers, fathers and their babies will enact stories on stage, as well as paint them in an impromptu piece of act,” she adds.
