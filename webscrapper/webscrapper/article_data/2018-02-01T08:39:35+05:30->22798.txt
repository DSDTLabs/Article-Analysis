CHANDIGARH: The   issues of the Sector-26 grain market have been unattended for long. The market’s exit gate next to the Police Lines is clogged with haphazardly   that are in the path of one-way traffic.

 The road, which is used to eject the swollen traffic of trucks, tractors, and cars carrying agricultural produce such as fruits and vegetables, is blocked by cars coming in from the wrong direction. The entire market length from the main entrance to the Police Lines, is sometimes jammed and there is no way out of the narrow path for hours.
 
 The carelessness of a few drivers causes a lot of discomfort to the vegetable and fruit vendors. “Vehicle’s aren’t allowed to enter the grain market from this point, because this is used only as an exit. Many people travelling from the lake, Panchkula, Manimajra, or IT Park use the Police Lines road and barge in there,” said  , a fruit-seller stationed close by. 
 
 A ‘one-way traffic’ sign, with an arrow pointing outwards, hasn’t helped. The defaulters ignore it conveniently and flout the rules. 
 
 One of the security guards said: “I have been deployed here for a few months to collect the parking receipts at the exit. But sometimes, these people in big cars threaten me and barge their cars into the gate without listening to me. They create a lot of problem when confronted.”
 
 A resident said: “Travelling from the lake or from any place in that direction, if we have to visit the grain market, entering from this place becomes easier because the main entrance is crowded usually.”
