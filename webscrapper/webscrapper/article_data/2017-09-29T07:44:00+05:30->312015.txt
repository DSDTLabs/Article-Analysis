Manali: A 57-year-old trekker from Mumbai, who was accompanied by 13 others, died near the remote Kangla glacier of Lahaul-Spiti district on Monday. The team brought the body to Keylong on Wednesday. The glacier can be reached from road after a two-day trek.

 Police said a 14-member team of trekkers, along with 24 porters, guides and cook started the journey on September 19. One of them, Vijay Parikh, was reported dead somewhere on Kangla glacier. Keylong DSP Sanjay Sharma said a six person team went to collect the body on Tuesday. “The trekkers brought the body to base camp. Our team handed it over to his relatives after postmortem examination,” he said.
 
 Vijay collapsed while trekking near the glacier and died before other team members could take him to the nearest hospital. This is the third death of a Mumbai trekker in Himachal since July. A trekker from Mumbai collapsed near Hamta on July 15 and another trekker died near Bhawa Pass on August 4.
