 The trend does not stop here. As many as 99,345 students failed to report for the important mathematics exam while 1.23 lakh left the science exam. Till April 1, the number of dropouts from classes X and XII across subjects had reached 5,94,503.
 
 Following the large-scale dropout rate, UP Board had initiated an internal probe in September 2016. The report revealed that mass duplication of name of students with the help of cheating mafia and fake registration by principals in filling forms were reasons for large number of absentees.
 
 This means that a large number of students marked `absent' do not exist at all.
 
 To check the irregularities, UP Board took away the power of finalising the online list of students from the principals, this year.
 
 At least 245 schools were debarred and action was taken against principals who had forged lists of students.
