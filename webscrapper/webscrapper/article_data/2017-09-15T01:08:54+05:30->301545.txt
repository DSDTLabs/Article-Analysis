NEW DELHI:   has issued   for improving the   of over   in its  . The move comes after the murder of seven-year-old Pradhyumn inside Ryan International School highlighted the absence of any safety protocol in schools. 

 The 30-point charter aims to improve security in over 719 schools. There is special focus on separate toilets for kids and keeping tabs on NGO workers, relatives of workers, van drivers, vendors and other outsiders coming inside the school property.
 
 Students will also be sensitised towards the issue so that they inform their teachers on seeing any outsider on the premises. Mayor Preeti Aggarwal said that the students in corporation schools, which have classes only up to the primary level — are very young and need special attention. “A security audit of all the schools will be done to ensure compliance. I have asked the officials to make it a time-bound process, with provisions of penalty in case of any violation,” she added. 
 
 Corporation schools that remain open are vulnerable to security lapses. When TOI visited one such school, there were no guards at the gate and one could easily walk in. Most posts of supporting staff like guards and school inspectors lie vacant. At present, there are very few guards and only 2 school inspectors against the sanctioned posts of 26. 
 
 According to the guidelines, schools have been directed to strictly ensure that students are not left alone with any outsider, including NGO members and guards. “Classrooms and other rooms that are not used on a particular day must be locked. No vendor should be permitted to sell any eatables near the school,” the guidelines said. 
 
 Principals have been asked to ensure that teachers do not use mobile phones in school.
