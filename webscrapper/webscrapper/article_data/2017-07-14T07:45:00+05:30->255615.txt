 “We are going to allot   plots to the oustees to take possession of the land that will pave the way for construction of master roads of sectors 91 to 115,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav, adding that land acquisition in sectors 58 to 90 has been completed and construction of roads are in different stages. 
 
 The sectors 91 to 115 are developed along the Dwarka expressway and a large number of residential and commercial projects are coming up in these areas. Some of the projects have been completed and many others are in advanced stages of completion.
 
 “Work is in progress to complete the remaining portion of the expressway and now they are expediting the construction of master roads of the sectors, which will pave the way for better connectivity of the sectors with the expressway,” Yadav said.
 
 To complete the acquisition for master roads of sectors 58-115, Huda has divided the sectors into five different zones — 58-67, 68-74, 75-80, 81-90 and 91-115.
 
 These have put an additional burden on cash-strapped Huda, which is first focussing on acquisition to complete the master roads in new sectors. Officials said the urban development authority is planning to complete the master roads at the earliest, as several thousand people have already moved into their homes in these new sectors.
 
 “Many projects are in advanced stages but there are no civic amenities in place. Once the master roads are built other civic amenities like water supply lines and drainage can be developed,” said Sushant Singh, who owns a flat in Sector 103. 
 
 “Along with the construction of master roads, authorities should also ensure completion of the remaining portion of Dwarka expressway,” he added.
