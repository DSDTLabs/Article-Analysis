NEW DELHI: A purported Kashmiri fighter owing allegiance to Islamic State has rejected the claim of  , an Al Qaeda affiliate led by Zakir Musa, that the Telangana-origin terrorist   killed in Anantnag on March 12, belonged to Ghazwat’s ranks.

 Pro-IS Telegram channels distributed an English message from the fighter, "  al-Kashmiri," on March 13, 2018, noting that while Taufeeq, who went by aliases   and Abu Zarr al-Hind , did join Ghazwat initially and provided narration for one of its videos, he ultimately deserted the group and joined fellow IS-pledged fighters in Kashmir. 
 
 Abu Anwar also claimed Taufeeq operated the pro-IS Telegram channel ‘Al-Hadeed Media’, SITE Intelligence website that tracks IS activities worldwide, reported on Friday.
 
 Ansar Ghazwatul Hind had on Tuesday claimed Taufeeq as its own, declaring on Al-Hurr Media that he had come to Kashmir from Hyderabad in 2017 and was among the first in the Zakir Musa-led group’s ranks. 
 
 The Al Qaeda claim came soon after pro-IS Telegram channels hailed the martyrdom of Fazili, referring to him as leader of the IS-pledged Kashmiri group, and asked Kashmiris to strive for ‘shahadat’ and replace every slain fighter with two. 
 
 In another message on March 13, Kashmiri IS fighter Abu Anwar discussed his experiences with Essa Fazili (AKA Abu Yahya al-Kashmiri, Abu Yahya al-Istashadi), the now-deceased leader of the IS-pledged Kashmiri group killed along with Taufeeq. He recalled that Fazili had desired to call other jihadist factions like Ghazwat to join IS and did not consider Musa and his fighters as "apostates" but rebels of the "Caliphate".
 
 Incidentally, J&K police maintain that IS as an organisation does not have any presence in the state, though there may be some
 
 lone wolves swayed by its jihadi ideology.
 
 J&K police sources had earlier claimed that Fazili, suspected in the killing of constable   last month, was part of Tehreek ul Mujahideen, a small jihadist group active in south and central Kashmir.
