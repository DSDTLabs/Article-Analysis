ROPAR: Senior SAD leader and Punjab education minister Dr   is facing a tough fight from  , a taxi driver in Delhi and Aam Adami Party (AAP) nominee. 

 Amarjit, a resident of Sandoa village in Nurpur Bedi block of Ropar, was given a ticket by AAP in its first list released in August, 2016. Cheema has contributed to the development of local roads and has also provided other facilities, like educational institutions. But issues such as sacrilege, Behbal Kalan and the Kotkapura firing remain deciding factors.
 
 Former Panjab University (PU), Chandigarh student leader and Congress nominee Barinder Singh Dhillon resonated with a large number of university and college students, who had been campaigning for him. Cheema, meanwhile, won the 2012 state assembly elections, securing 41,595 votes and defeating Romesh Dutt Sharma of the Congress by a margin of 8,882 votes.
 
 But AAP emerged strongly in the 2014 parliamentary elections, when it secured around 30,000 votes. The present candidate appears to have made the most of it. Village residents said in the past six months, AAP candidate Sandoa reached out to each and every voter of the constituency, striking a chord with his aam aadmi (common man) image.
 
 Sandoa, 38, went to Delhi in 1997, where he worked as helper in a taxi stand. Later, he learnt driving and worked as taxi operator.
