The survey by Helping Hands on discrimination faced by   patients also revealed serious lapses in the   control programme in the state. The Telangana State AIDS Control Society (TSACS) was not able to utilise funds. While a total of 70 crore was sanctioned, 7 crore was unspent. 

 Most patients have not been getting the 35-kg rice entitled to them under the 'Antodaya Anaj Yojna', from 2009 onwards, the survey said. It also found 45% of the respondents were not receiving monthly 1,000 support under  . Facilities such as 26 mobile vans purchased by erstwhile   (APSACS) have also also lying defunct. These vans, bought for 18 lakh each and using up 80,000 a month towards operational costs, were to help high risk groups. 
 
 When contacted, commissioner, family welfare,   refuted allegations of corruption in TSACS.
