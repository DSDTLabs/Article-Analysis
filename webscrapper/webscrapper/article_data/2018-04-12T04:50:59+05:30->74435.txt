KOLKATA: Passengers on board Tuesday night’s last Sealdah-Lakshmikantapur local went through a heart-stopping few moments when the loco hit a two-wheeler left on the tracks outside   station and proceeded to push it in front as it entered the station. Many of them jumped on to the platform even before the train halted, fearing that the two-wheeler’s fuel tank would burst.

 Around 11.45pm, three drunk men were trying to cross the tracks a little ahead of the station. Seeing the train approach, they fled leaving their vehicle. The train was barely a metre away and couldn’t be stopped in time. It ended up hitting the two-wheeler and pushed it into the station.
 
 The fuel tank and some parts of the vehicle were removed at Narendrapur station and the loco proceeded to   station, where it was cancelled. Another rake then carried the passengers till Laksmikantapur. More than thousand commuters who were supposed to reach their destination by 1.20am, finally made it there around 2.30am.
 
 Nazir  , a regular on the train, said, “We were all scared the fuel tank would burst after the train hit the two-wheeler.” SRP   said, “Train services were disrupted for an hour. We are trying to trace the trio who own the two-wheeler.”
