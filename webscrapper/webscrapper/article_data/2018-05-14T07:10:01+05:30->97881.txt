CHANDIGARH: As Chandigarh municipal corporation has already kick-started an exercise to construct vending zones for the selected vendors of Chandigarh, it has finally asked Society for the Promotion of IT in Chandigarh (SPIC), an agency of IT department of the Chandigarh administration, to prepare smart cards of vendors. SPIC will start with the process of the same soon. 

 As per information, these smart cards will carry all required details of a vendor. Moreover, with such cards, the MC will also be able to maintain a proper digital record of each vendor of the city, sector-wise as well as ward-wise.
 
 "The smart cards will also carry information like exact location of the vending zone, the space allotted, details of monthly fee deposition to the authority and so on. Moreover, with this exercise, we will also be able to keep check over the subletting of the vending space," said sources in the MC.
 
 Since MC has stopped taking the payments directly from the vendors and linked the payment mode with E-Sampark centres of the city, now the details of the payment made by each vendor will be maintained on a regular basis.
