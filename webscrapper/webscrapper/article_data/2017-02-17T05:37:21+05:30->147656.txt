PANAJI: Stating the government has given too long a timespan to the 17,500-odd   and   to cast their  ,   on Thursday demanded the process be rounded up soon.

 “By giving employees a month to cast their votes, the government is keeping a window open to target the 17,000 voters, leaving candidates with a good chance to try and lure them,” AAP candidate Dr Oscar Rebello said, while speaking to mediapersons at a press conference here.
 
 The party’s CM candidate Elvis Gomes said almost all government employees have returned to their offices post-election duty and this doesn’t explain the delay in them sending in their postal ballots.
 
 Gomes also said it was unfortunate that   had “clandestinely closed the Vasco rape case”. He also said the government should take the demands of the liquor vendors to Supreme Court as they were not the sole factor behind fatalities on roads. 
 
 “Road engineering in the state leaves much to be desired,” he said, adding that the government would have gone out of its way to protect interests if it were casinos that were getting affected.
