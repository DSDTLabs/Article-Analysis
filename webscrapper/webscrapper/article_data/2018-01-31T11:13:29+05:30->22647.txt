CHENNAI: S Dhanyasri, the four-year-old girl on whom a man came   on Monday, is in the ICU of a private hospital after suffering internal haemorrhage.

 Her grandfather  , who works with  , is cursing the moment he decided to take the girl out to buy her biscuits. Just as they were about to get back home, a man fell from an apartment balcony, injuring Dhanyasri badly.
 
 Quoting doctors, police said the child had blood clots in her head. The incident happened around 9.30pm on Sunday. “Doctors said they are yet to decide on whether to do a surgery on the girl,” said an investigating officer.
 
 RSiva, a labourer, a labourer who fell from the balcony, weighed about 65kg, and the impact would’ve been worse had the fall been not halted temporarily by some overhead television cables. Doctors treating the girl have told the family that she needs to be under observation. The girl’s father has a water supply agency. The family may not be able to   for long at the private hospital, and welcomes donations.
