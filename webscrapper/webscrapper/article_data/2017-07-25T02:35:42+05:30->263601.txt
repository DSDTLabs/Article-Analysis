GURUGRAM : The divisional commissioner (DC) of Gurgaon met around 150 parents from   on Monday, who assembled outside his office to demand reports of audit against the school to be made public. D Suresh, who is also the chairman of the   (FFRC), assured the parents of taking relevant action after receiving the audit report on Monday.

 “Sureshji assured parents he will receive the audit reports today and will initiate relevant action based on it within 2-3 days,” the statement released to the media read. 
 
 Suresh had ordered an audit on May 22, amid furore against many city schools for allegedly charging capitation fees from parents every year, though the practice is prohibited under   2003. On Monday, he told TOI he has received the report but hasn’t gone through it.
 
 “I received the report today but haven’t read it yet. We’ll issue an order after I go through it,” said Suresh.
 
 He added that as temporary relief to parents, he has asked the school to extend the fee submission date a second time. “They had earlier extended the date from July 15 to July 25. I’ve told them to extend it by another week,” he said.
 
 Parents told TOI this was the fifth time in two months they had approached Suresh over the issue. “We’re waiting for the report in earnest. We’re against exorbitant fee hike by the school. DC had ordered the audit in May. We want the report to be published as it would be in our favour,” said Mahesh Yadav, a parent.
 
 “Parents are hopeful about some relief from the administration, otherwise our complaints seemed to be falling on deaf ears,” said Meenakshi Gaur, another parent.
 
 Earlier in July, Suresh told TOI that Blue Bells group of schools was not co-operating with auditors. Parents said, Suresh had warned the school he’d issue an interim order against it. “After that, the school gave auditors access to their records,” said Yadav.
 
 None of the Blue Bells officials TOI contacted for comment replied.
