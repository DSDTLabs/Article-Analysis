AMARAVATI: Chandrababu Naidu can cheer with global consultancy firm   assuring him that it will bring   Pradesh and the capital city, Amaravati. 

 The firm's global director Jonathan Woetzel said that they are planning to bring at least 20 Chinese firms to AP. This was made clear during the chief minister's discussions with Jonathan in Davos on Thursday. 
 
 Jonathan said that the future is bright for India and China and that 25 per cent of world's GDP and technology will accrue from these two countries. Jonathan assured that he will facilitate Chinese investments to the state and Amaravati. "I will facilitate networking with 20 most important companies and investors from China in next three months," said Jonathan.
 
 The chief minister said that McKinsey's best talent should help mobilize finances and also investments in Andhra Pradesh.
 
 He also held discussions with JP Morgan head of strategy, Max Neukirchen, and sought assistance in making AP a global destination for investments. He asked them to leverage their international networking to bring in finances for the development of Amaravati. "Andhra Pradesh has a number of resources and opportunities that they can explore," said the chief minister. 
 
 He also explained that they were monitoring water levels, street lights, welfare and other programmes online. 
 
 The CM later met Jan Suzuki, president and chief executive officer, Teijin Ltd, Japan. Teijin deals with carbon and aluminium fibres. Since Teijin is importing massive quantities of fibres that are used in optical fibre cable supporting sheets, the chief minister appealed to them to set up their unit in AP. 
 
 General Atlantic chief Sandeep Naik promised the chief minister to explore possibility to fund start-ups in AP. General Atlantic manages $30 billion fund and their core sectors include IT and healthcare.
