VISAKHAPATNAM: Even though   in the district are in full bloom, excessive use of fungicides and pesticides by lease holders is proving to be a threat to the flowers. 

 According to the latest studies provided by the  , farmers are using more than three times the volume of pesticides required to keep the insects away.
 
 “Mancozeb and Carbandozim are mild fungicides. However, even they can cause immense damage if sprayed more than three times. The problem with the contractors is that they are getting greedy and use strong fungicides and chemical sprays on the flowers,” said K Srinivasulu, a field expert from NG Ranga Agriculture University. He further added that excessive use of fungicides during a prolonged dry spell could cause the flowers to burn and effect the trees on the long run.
 
 VN Bhushan, a farmer from Narsipatnam, said, “My mango tope has been given on lease to a contractor and I’m regretting my decision as he is destroying my plantation. Excessive use of pesticides and fungicides have taken a toll on the trees and I have not befitted financially either.”
 
 Sources in the horticulture department pointed out that unrestricted use of pesticides has been a problem for over two decades and its on the rise. They added that the only way to control this practice is by going organic. However, most farmers will not go organic as they have to tackle possible pest migration from other plantations. tnn
