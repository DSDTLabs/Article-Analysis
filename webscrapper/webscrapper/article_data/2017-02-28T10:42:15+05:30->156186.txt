MALAPPURAM: Speculations over the candidates for the upcoming byelection to the   constituency intensified, after the decision of   to elevate P K Kunhalikutty to the post of national general secretary.

 It seems, Kunhalikutty has emerged as the frontrunner for the UDF candidature in the byelection though the party is yet to begin any official discussion in this regard. Anticipating UDF's move to rope in a senior Muslim League leader with an aim to set a new record in victory margin, the LDF has also started its search for a suitable candidate. Meanwhile, parties such as   (SDPI) and   (WPI) are also aiming to register their strong presence in the Muslim majority constituency, in the election.
 
 The reconstitution of national committee of IUML on Sunday hinted at the possibility of Kunhalikutty's candidature in the bypoll as he has already expressed his wish to contest from Malappuram. But addressing media on Monday at Malappuram, he said that party would announce the candidate for byelection at the right time and no official discussion regarding this was held.
 
 But a senior national leader of the party said that the informal discussions regarding the candidate for Malappuram were already on. “If Kunhalikutty contests in the bypoll, the party would have to face another assembly by-election in Vengara, the constituency which is now being represented by Kunhalikutty . So the party will seriously discuss the issue before considering his name as candidate“, he said.
 
 The names of   and the daughter of E Ahamed, Fousiya have also emerged as possible candidates.
