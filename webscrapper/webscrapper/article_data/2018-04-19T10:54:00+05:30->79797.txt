Hollywood star Tom Cruise was the first choice to play Raj Malhotra's character in Bollywood blockbuster 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'. Yes! You read it right. The makers wanted to make the film an Indo-American affair, however, they also didn’t want to make any Hollywood hero a star in this film. Hence, the idea of getting Cruise for the film was scrapped. Interestingly, not just Tom Cruise but Bollywood’s Nawab, Saif Ali Khan was also considered to play the character. However, the role went to Shah Rukh Khan, who portrayed Raj so well, that now a DDLJ fan cannot just imagine the film without him.
