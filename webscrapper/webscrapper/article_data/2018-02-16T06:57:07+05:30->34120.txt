Fire brigade officials said they received a call around 4.20pm and they rushed six rescue vans to the spot. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF),   and Karnataka Disaster Management Authority personnel joined police and firemen in the rescue operation. Twenty-two   personnel from Hyderabad are slated to join their 25 colleagues in the mission.

 MN Reddi, DG, Fire and Emergency Services, said, “We suspect nine labourers are trapped under the debris.”
 
 Around 8.30pm, rescue workers zeroed in on a man trapped inside and were trying to cut through cement and steel to reach him. His voice could be heard. The man, Sadanand, was rescued. The area was in darkness because the transformer was damaged.
 
 Police commissioner T   said the owner had been identified as Rafiq, and contractor as Krishnakant Reddy. Both are at large.
 
 Rafiq, from Kerala, runs a series of supermarkets and lives in HSR Layout, police sources said. His wife Sameera was taken into custody for questioning. Police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under IPC Section 304.
 
 “We learnt that 22 people were working in the building. But we don’t know if all of them were inside at that time. I’ve asked DCP ( )   to find out if there were any lapses or violations on the part of the owner or the contractor. We will take stringent action against   officials if they are found to be negligent,” Kumar said.
