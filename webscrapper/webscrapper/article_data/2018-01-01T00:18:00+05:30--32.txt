Trichy: The district administration is all set to unveil a mega recreational avenue in Trichy in the new year in collaboration with the city corporation. The promise comes close on the heels of the recently-launched tourist package in Patchamalai receiving an overwhelming response.  “We have been discussing with the city corporation creation of a recreational avenue similar to that of a theme park with considerable green cover,” district collector K Rajamani said. He admitted that there were hardly any avenues for recreational activities in the city and that plans were afoot to raise a facility in the coming months. “ It will be set up either with the help of business community or by the city corporation,” said the collector. Meanwhile, Patchamalai hills have been witnessing patronage like never before ever since the area was developed as an eco-tourism spot. Tourist accommodation offered by the forest department on the hills has been booked till Pongal holidays. Interestingly, there is tourist flow even during the week days unlike in the past when most of the rooms were unoccupied even during weekends. This has happened after the forest department introduced trekking packages a few weeks ago apart from bringing down the tariff.  The department had come up with an exclusive weekend trekking package for nature lovers a couple of weeks ago. The package, scheduled for Friday/Saturday evening extend up to the next day at Top Sengattupatti ecotourism centre. Going a step further, the forest department slashed accommodation charges up to one-third of the cost for the tree-top houses and dormitories which also contributed to the increase in patronage.  According to the forest officials, this is the busiest season in two years ever since treetop houses and dormitories were inaugurated. Most of the time these facilities had remained unoccupied. District forest officer Naga Sathish Gidijala said that the response was overwhelming from the people.
