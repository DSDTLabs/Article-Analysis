Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to the Central government, UT administration, home secretary, UT adviser, Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) chairman and the   on a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the conversion rates from leasehold to freehold and the “tatkal” service.

 The PIL filed by Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan sought a CBI inquiry into the matter, alleging “huge level of corruption is going in the name of tatkal service and need-based changes”. The matter would come up for hearing on July 31.
 
 Senior advocates M L Saggar and A P S Shergill argued that the tatkal scheme was a tool for corruption and should be struck down. The PIL alleged the authorities were behaving like a private real estate company whose sole objective was to make money and profit. It was argued tatkal fee from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 for various categories (EWS, LIG, MIG, HIG) was not only uncalled for but against the basic principles of the law laid down in this regard. “The tatkal scheme is also against the basic principle of law as Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) could not introduce a fresh categorization within an existing categorization, contrary to the clear-cut well laid down notification of 1996 need-based changes,” the PIL alleged.
 
 Enhancing the old conversion fee for each dwelling unit was also challenged. It was argued that this was done in order to generate money by creating problems for allottees having leasehold and freehold property. The rise from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000 per dwelling unit to nearly Rs 3.30 lakh was not legally tenable and arbitrary in the eyes of law, the PIL said.
 
 The lawyers argued that application form fee (for all purposes) had been increased from Rs 25 to 250 per application. The PIL demanded the CBI register cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act against the officials who deliberately violated the implementation of the need-based changes.
