THANE: A sessions court has rejected the bail application of a 40-year-old supervisor of a residential school in the tribal belt of Jawahar in   who was arrested for molesting a 16-year-old mentally challenged girl. 

 District sessions judge   observed that the supervisor is the guardian of the student but he misused her trust and committed the offence. She observed prima facie arguments by police and the medical examination report of the girl indicated sexual assault. 
 
 The incident came to light last month when a caretaker was giving the girl a bath and noticed swelling and black marks on her hands, chest and back. The girl revealed her ordeal and pointed the finger at the school supervisor. He had also allegedly threatened the girl against telling anyone.
 
 Subsequently, the school lodged a complaint, based on which he was booked and arrested under section of 354(B) (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) of the Indian Penal Code and section 8, 9(f) and 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act, 2012.
 
 The supervisor said he has been falsely implicated in the case due to animosity with the school administration. Also, there was substantial delay in lodging the case, he said.
 
 Opposing his bail application, the prosecutor submitted that the statement of the girl recorded by the investigation officer showed the supervisor had removed her clothes and sexually assaulted her. The prosecutor said there is no reason for the girl to file a false complaint. The prosecutor said as the probe is in progress, there was possibility of tampering with the witnesses if he is granted bail. 
 
 Also, the delay in the case was caused because the accused had threatened the minor.
