The black mosquitoes hovering over your head in swarms creating nuisance are common house mosquitoes called Culex. The monthly insect character report from the health department for March says that the infected Culex mosquito is responsible for spreading  , commonly known as elephantiasis.

 The report, compiled from the four wards of the city, states Culex is the predominant species in the air currently. Other mosquito species including the ones that spread dengue,   and chikungunya have not been found.
 
 This comes even as the city has reported 26 positive cases of dengue since January.
 
 The monthly report by the malaria unit of the health department is prepared when the insect catchers from each of the four wards—A (  and allied areas), B (trans-Gomti area), C (Old City) and D (  and adjoining areas) collect samples of larvae and insects from stagnant and fresh water and from in and around houses.
 
 While the health department claimed that there are currently no dengue-infected mosquitoes in the air, officials also said the peak season for all vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya was July to November as moisture content in the air is high and temperatures range between 20 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius.
 
 This is also a time when air coolers are not in use and rainwater accumulates in several unused places in and around homes. Stagnant water is a breeding heaven for dengue-causing mosquitoes.
 
 On the 26 dengue cases reported already, additional chief medical officer Dr   said, “Some cases reported are of infected people who have travelled to the city from elsewhere. The disease cannot be eradicated completely and the egg of the dengue causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito can survive for at least a year. We are working towards the menace. Our programme ‘Har Ravivar machhar pe vaar’ has also been relaunched.”
