   TV actor and anchor   talks about her favourite serials on television and the childhood memories associated with them
 
  
 
  For the longest time even after the introduction of television, my parents never bought a TV set as they were quite strict with our
  studies. I remember going to our neighbour’s house to watch it. One fine day, while I was in third grade, my parents finally bought a TV. Jungle Book and   were a hot favourite back then. I also remember telling my parents back then that one day I would also be on TV. It has been a 13-year journey on the small screen now.
  
  
 
  Small Wonder. It was about a boy and his little sister who was a robot. It was the cutest thing I ever watched on TV back then. I also loved watching serials like   on DD. Pallavi Joshi was my favourite and I loved a navy-based serial, in which she played the protagonist. The Coorg in me was probably the reason I adored it so much.   on a private channel was another favourite. I later acted in its remake in Kannada, which was titled  . It was a huge hit.
  
  
 
  Don’t get carried away by the fame which has come to you in an instant. Don’t also be dejected by downfall. Both are part of this small screen world.
