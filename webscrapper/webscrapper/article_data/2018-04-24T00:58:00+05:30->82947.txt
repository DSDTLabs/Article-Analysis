Madurai: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Monday adjourned the case relating to elections to co-operative societies in the state, to May.  On Monday, when the batch of cases filed against the Tamil Nadu state co-operative elections came up for further hearing, the court was told about a recent development in the issue. Aggrieved at the status quo ordered by the high court’s division bench of justices C T Selvam and A M Basheer Ahamed during an earlier hearing, the Tamil Nadu State Co-operative Election Commission preferred an appeal before the Supreme Court. The bench had then observed that the AIADMK is one of parties to the case, against which allegations have been levelled. Hence, its reply is necessary to decide the case on hand. The party has to file a reply and the case is adjourned to April 23. Till then, the status quo would continue, the bench had said. Three days ago, the apex court, which heard the poll panel’s appeal refused to stall the poll process but at the same time it told the election commission not to declare the results until a decision is taken on its petition. Following it, the court adjourned the case.  It may be recalled that the election commission had on March 5 announced four phase elections to 18,435 primary cooperative societies that come under the state’s 15 departments. Challenging the elections, several petitions were filed. During arguments, the court was told that in most cases the commission accepted nominations of candidates belonging to the ruling AIADMK and declared them as winners.
