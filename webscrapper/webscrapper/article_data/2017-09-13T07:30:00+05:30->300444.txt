Also, a woman attendant is mandatory in every school bus ferrying schoolchildren, especially girls. The DC said that the instructions had been issued to prevent child abuse cases in the district. 

 She further said that, “With an alarming increase in number of cases of child abuse, it is the need of the hour to be more sensitive and vigilant towards child’s physical, social and emotional well-being. We have directed managements and principals of all government and private schools/colleges in the district to take necessary action to prevent child abuse.”
 
 It has been made clear here that random checking will be done by the district administration and in case of any negligence, the school/college management and the head of the school/college would be held vicariously liable and strict action be taken against him/her.
