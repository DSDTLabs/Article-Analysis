GURGAON: For a state that saw over  ,000 people die in accidents last year, the Haryana government has set itself a mammoth task. It wants its highways to be fatalities-free by 2020.

 Vision Zero, a global movement that aims towards eliminating traffic deaths altogether, has caught the fancy of chief minister  , who will launch the initiative in the state on January 27 and 28. The state transport department and traffic police will supervise the initiative, with a goal to bring road accident deaths to zero by 2020.
 
 The decision to launch the initiative was taken following an increase in the number of deaths from road accidents across the state. Across Haryana, 5,024 people lost their lives in 11,234 accidents last year. In 2015, around 4,879 people lost their lives in 11,174 accidents.
 
 In Gurgaon, the number of accidents continues to rise. There were 420 deaths reported in 1,201 accidents in 2016, compared to 435 deaths in 1,142 accidents in 2015. Around 68% of the deceased were in the 18-44 years age group, many among them sole breadwinners of their families.
 
 Later this month, the governor of the state will sign a memorandum of understanding with Nasscom and WRI India. Special programmes will be conducted to educate and build execution capacity through awareness drives for designers of roads, town planners, public works departments, municipalities and police. 
 
 Campaigns will be run by road safety associates, including road experts, engineers and designers, to inculcate behavioural changes among citizens. “The associates will help police in investigating road accidents and study flaws in roads, be it natural obstructions like steep slopes or trees, or engineering flaws like a blind cut,,” said  , state DIG (traffic and highways) and joint CP in Gurgaon.
