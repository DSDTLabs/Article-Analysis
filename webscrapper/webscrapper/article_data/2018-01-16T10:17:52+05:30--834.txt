AHMEDABAD/JAIPUR: There was high drama all through Monday when the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)’s international working president Pravin  , who went “missing” after Rajasthan police came calling with arrest warrants, was “found” admitted to Ahmedabad’s Chandramani Hospital with low sugar.

 Director of the hospital, Dr Roopkumar Agarwal, said that Togadia was shifted to the hospital by EMRI 108 emergency service around 9.15pm in a semi-concious state. “He had low blood sugar. After he was given treatment, his condition started stabilising. He is not in a position to give a detailed statement,” said Dr Agarwal.
 
 Togadia, who was last seen leaving the VHP’s office in southwest Ahmedabad’s Paldi area at 10.45pm in an auto with a bearded man, was shifted from Kotarpur in Naroda, police said. 
 
 Earlier in the day, reports of the VHP leader’s arrest by the Rajasthan police from Ahmedabad had sparked widespread protests.
 
 Tension prevailed as VHP activists hit the streets, blocking roads and stopping buses in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat, Rajkot even as the organistations Gujarat unit functionaries filed a missing person complaint to trace Togadia’s whereabouts. The Ahmedabad crime branch had formed four teams to trace Togadia.
 
 “The crime branch had assured us that they will locate Pravinbhai Togadia in the next 24 hours. We urge our workers to maintain peace,” said Gujarat VHP general secretary Ranchhod Bharwad, who had during the day alleged foul play and threatened that VHP workers would spill out on streets if Togadia was not traced soon.
