BHOPAL: Breaking his silence over speculations regarding changes in the  ,   said on Thursday that there was no discussion in the party over change in the leadership or his appointment to the  

 “There is no discussion related to organisational changes in the party. It is the worker who runs the party and   will fight assembly elections under the leadership of its workers to again form a government in 2018,” Tomar replied to queries regarding removal of Nandkumar Singh Chouhan as state party president and his appointment to the coveted post.
 
 Tomar’s statement has come at a time when the party leaders are expecting a major reshuffle in the state organisation amid reports of non-performance and anti-incumbency.
 
 When asked what he would do if the party offers him the post of state president, Tomar said, “When there is no such idea in the party, there is no need to discuss the matter. Party workers won the assembly polls for the third time in 2013 through hard work and dedication, and they would be successful in forming the government again”.
 
 Despite Tomar’s refusal on possibility of a change in the state leadership, the BJP is mulling a major rejig in the organisation starting with the formation of an ‘election management and publicity committee’ to manage poll campaign for Mission 2018.
 
 Tomar, along with Dave and  , had played a crucial role in managing the team in 2008 and 2013 assembly polls and successfully scored a hattrick in the state.
 
 The party’s central leadership wants to repeat the history, though Tomar has shown no interest in returning to the state as BJP chief.
 
 Still the party has big plans to shift him. During his visit, Tomar hit out at Congress and dubbed the party as ‘ ‘irrelevant’. “Congress has no issue left to raise before the public. The party has become irrelevant in MP. BJP has done a lot for farmers as compared to Congress ,” he said.
