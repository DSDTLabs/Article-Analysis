KOLKATA:   is set to undergo the first major repair since it was built 25 years ago.

 The Setu, also known as the Second Hooghly Bridge, was commissioned on October 10, 1992, two decades after the late Indira Gandhi laid the foundation on May 20, 1972. Now, the   government has planned its extensive renovation, international bids for which are being invited.
 
 Sadhan Bandopadhyay, chairman,   Commissioner that is in charge of the bridge, said, "There had been some minor repair works in the past. The main portion will undergo renovation now."
 
 A fortnight ago, HRBC had engaged railways consultancy agency , Rites, to oversee the bidding process. Bandopadhyay said, "The contract with Ri tes was signed so that we get professional guidance for floating tenders and are able to choose the best company . The com parative bid will help us clinch the best financial and technical offer."
 
 In June 2013, HRBC initia ted a three-year survey of the bridge with help of German ex perts and IIEST (formerly BE College, Shibpur) engineers The survey comprised detailed visual inspections of the entire structure, including investiga tions of the 832m main section and 16km ramp. The probe re port was submitted a few months ago. "Based on its re commendations, smaller ex pansion joints, with 2030-yea lifespan, were replaced in Ja nuary this year," said a source.
 
 But India's second longes cable-stayed bridge needed ela borate repair, considering the fact that its vehicular load ha increased manifold since the chief minister shifted her se cretariat from Writers' Buil dings to   in Octobe 2013.
 
 The tendering process wil be over in the next six months "Once comparative bidding i over, we will get a clear picture of the nature of repair and the cost," Bandopadhyay said.
