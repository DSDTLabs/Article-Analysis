Mirror had earlier reported that National Award winning director   would start on a musical next, produced by  , who had played the protagonist in his comedy drama 'Ventilator'. 

  
  
 But before beginning work on this project, Rajesh will be directing a 55-second video, a tribute to  , featuring  , who played the younger   in Garth Davis’s BAFTA-winning film 'Lion'.
 
 After he wrapped up 'Ventilator', Rajesh was approached by Vinod Tawde, State Education Minister, Marathi Bhasha, Cultural Affairs, to create awareness about the Father of Indian cinema. "I was excited and immediately came on board," says Rajesh.
 
 The story is set in Maharashtra and starts with a child wondering who made the first film. "Some cosmic intervention happens and he is transported back in time to see Dadasaheb Phalke taking the first shot of Raja Harishchandra. The plan is to attach the video to the national anthem when aired in cinemas across the state before a film begins," informs Rajesh, who will be shooting with Sunny in a village near Satara on August 2 and 4.
 
  "I’ve seen Lion and I loved him. This character required a certain innocence and Sunny fits the bill. With Lion, he has gone to Hollywood and seen the best of the industry. I’m sure he must be curious to know who has made the first film. I can’t wait to start shooting."
