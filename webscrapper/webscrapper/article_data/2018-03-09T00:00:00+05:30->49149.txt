Five students of the MVJ College of Engineering recently won cash prize of `1,00,000 at a summit organized by IISC Bangalore, for creating a   that allows verbally and hearing-impaired individuals to communicate with others. Finals year students Devanshu Jha, Chiragdeep Singh Malhorta, Muhammad Hameem Safwat Hussain, Abhishek Nanda and Moinudeen created a hand glove embedded with   that allows a person to communicate with others.

 How did the idea of creating a device like this come about? “It happened when we were brainstorming ideas for our project. Since we have a few friends who are enrolled in a speech and hearing institute in the city, we have seen how difficult it is for them to communicate in sign languages with those who do not know the sign language. Their confidence just drops and that’s when we realized that we wanted to make a device that allow them to communicate with others,” says Muhammad.
 
 The glove, he says, is fitted with sensors, which pick up the signs and collect the data from all the sensors in each finger to translate the sign and the output is shown through an LCD screen. “The person who is wearing the glove communicates in sign language and these signs are picked up by the sensors and the result is on the screen,” says Muhammad. The team has worked on improving the prototype and are currently working on creating a design that is compact and easy to carry. “Our second prototype had a camera and a laptop. So, the camera would track the motion and process the message. But we thought this would be a little impractical. We want to create a design that is compact and easy to use,” Muhammad sums up.
