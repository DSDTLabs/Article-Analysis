This 63-second announcement has been doing the rounds on social media via WhatsApp widely since late on Monday.
 
 Ajay S Jasra, director (corporate communication), IndiGo told TOI that since the airline has a base in Bengaluru, the choice of an all local crew was all but natural. “We strive to put an all local crew wherever possible on such inaugural flights,” he said, adding the choice of language in announcements is that of the pilot. “Since he too was a local and apparently well versed with the local languages (Tulu/Konkani), he must have announced it,” Ajay added.
