AJMER: The claims of four priests to the post of ‘mahant’ of the famous   of Pushkar will be examined at the meeting of ‘akhada’ (group of priests) on Friday afternoon. The akhada will decide on who will become the next chief priest of this important temple.

 The current mahant of temple, Sompuri, had died in a road accident near Jaipur while returning to Ajmer on Wednesday.
 
 Sources said that the claims of   would come up at the meeting. His claim has been pending before the court since 2013 when Sompuri took over as mahant.
 
 Shrava Parashar, who is a coordinator of the association of priests in Pushkar, is another candidate who could also possibly lay claim to the post. “A relative of the deceased   is another candidate,” said a source.
 
 Sources said that priests of Haridwar have also showed a keen interest in the process of appointing the new mahant. After the death of last mahant Laharpuri in 2013, the Sompuri faction, which had the support of   of Haridwar and local akhadas, had performed his last rites and claimed the post as successor. Shiv Jyotish Anand group, supported by  , has also laid claims to the post.
 
 Sources said that the association of priests of Brahma Temple wanted a person of knowledge, while the akhada sect thinks otherwise. Looking at issues that have risen in the past over appointing new mahants, the district administration is on alert and has requested these groups not to disturb the peace of the place.
 
 Akhada is a sect of priests such as ‘puris,’ ‘das,’ ‘giris’ who follow a religious practice that dates back to when Pushkar was ruled by the sect. But there is now a demand for the state devasthan department to take over control of the temple and appoint a receiver there.
