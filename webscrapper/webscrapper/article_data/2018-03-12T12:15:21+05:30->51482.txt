PANAJI: South West Port Limited ( ), a unit of Jindal   Works (JSW) which was asked to stop coal handling at Mormugao Port Trust due to excess coal handling, has asked the Goa state pollution control board ( ) to let them import high-grade iron ore supposedly from  .

 A senior officer at GSPCB said that SWPL was importing 5.5 million tonnes of coal per annum at berth numbers 5A and at 6A. SWPL has permission to import 1 million tonnes of limestone and export 1 million tonnes of steel.
 
 The officer said that SWPL has imported around half a million tonnes of limestone, and they want to import the remaining quantity of iron ore. “We have not taken any decision on the proposal,” he said.
 
 MPT has backed SWPL’s proposal. “It is requested to kindly accord necessary permission for handling iron ore at berths 5A and 6A as this would be in the interest of MPT considering that the port is in severe financial stress,” he said.
 
 “As a result of the stoppage of iron ore mining from March 15, 2018, the cargo throughout the port has been adversely affected,” he wrote in a letter. “Low-grade Goan iron ore was being regularly exported from the port (upto 40 million tonnes per annum). However, the business dynamics have changed and now there is a need to import high-grade ore to meet the requirement of steel production. A request has come from SWPL for the import of iron ore.”
 
 Speaking on the decision of the apex court to quash the renewal of 88 mining leases in Goa, JSW Steel’s chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal urged chief minister Manohar Parrikar to respect the verdict and urged him to auction the leases.
 
 Directorate of mines and geology last week directed mining companies to stop iron ore extraction by 6pm on March 13, and transportation of ore by 6pm on March 14. The direction follows the Supreme Court’s order to cease all mining activity by March 15.
