VADODARA: A civil contractor handling big-scale projects died while his wife is in a critical condition after they attempted suicide by consuming poison on Monday evening. 

 While the contractor   (40) died during treatment in the early hours of Tuesday, his wife Heena (38) is critical and undergoing treatment in a private hospital on  .
 
 Although Vadodara rural police have registered a case of accidental death stating that the reason for their extreme step is unknown, Thakkar’s brother-in-law   saithat the husband and wife consumed poison because Thakkar had to collect over Rs four crore from nine builders which was outstanding for the last four years.
 
 “My brother-in-law made a WhatsApp group named ‘Alvida’ before taking the extreme step and added all nine builders and two supervisors in it. He wrote in the group that since the builders have not paid him the amount, he and my sister are consuming poison,” said Himanshu, who owns a mobile phone showroom in partnership with Thakkar.
 
 “Since the builders had not paid the money to him since four to five years, he had borrowed money from market which he was not able to pay,” Himanshu told TOI.
 
 He added that the two supervisors forwarded the message to him following which he and his sisters tried to contact the couple, but their calls went unanswered. It was only after they had consumed poison, the call was answered and they were informed that the couple was on Bhimpura-Samlaya Road.
 
 The couple has a 10-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy.
 
 When Himanshu reached there, the couple was in semi-conscious state. They were rushed to a private hospital on Race Course Road where Thakkar died around 3am.
 
 Police have, however, not taken Himanshu’s statement. “The family is mourning and Heena too is unconscious. Therefore we have not recorded anyone’s statement yet,” said a police official.
