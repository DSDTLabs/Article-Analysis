THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   said here on Tuesday that the people of the state are totally fed up with the seven-month rule of the  . 

 Speaking after inaugurating a   dharna against the 'anti-people' policies of the state and central governments in front of the secretariat, Chennithala said that the   rule has put the lives of the people into deep misery.
 
 The LDF government has still not found a solution to the difficulties faced in the supply of ration through the public distribution system. It has not got an assurance from the Centre on restoring the ration quota to the state.
 
 "The chief minister is claiming that normalcy in ration supply will be achieved by April. Can the people wait till April to have food," asked Chennithala.
 
 The opposition leader also mocked at the chief minister for not having confidence in his food and civil supplies minister. "If chief minister   does not trust P Thilothaman then he should be removed from the government. When the chief minister went to meet the prime minister to discuss the ration crisis faced by the state, it was strange that the food and civil supplies minister was not taken along with him,'' said Chennithala.
