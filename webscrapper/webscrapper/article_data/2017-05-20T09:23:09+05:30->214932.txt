BHOPAL: In a first of its kind agitation, villagers in   have started a dharna against illegal   from the Ken river, threatening that it will continue till illegal mining is stopped.

 Ramcharan Singh, a resident of Hinota village said, “For the past one month, the mafia men have been digging sand round-the-clock. We have already told the local police about it, but in vain. Following the complaint, the administration had intervened and asked the contractor not to indulge in illegal mining, but it didn’t yield the desired result.” He said the villagers have been regularly receiving “threats” from the mafia, but they are committed to go ahead with their agitation. “We will intensify it further,” he said. The mining contractor was leased out a mine, but he extended the excavation work to the neighbouring mines, which was illegal, villagers told district administration. In a memorandum submitted to the district collector last week, the villagers said that the mafia men in turn have “threatened the villagers to set the whole village on fire, if they continue to object.”
 
 District collector   said he has already ordered an inquiry by the district mining officer. “We will take strict action against illegal mining,” he said. Hinota village is located in Chandla tehsil of Chhatarpur district bordering Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh. Villagers alleged that heavy earth moving machines are deployed in the area to dig out the sand from Ken river. Besides, truck and dumpers ply at regular intervals from Mahoba to Hinota for transporting the mineral. “As the operations of mining and transportation are carried out round-the-clock, the village is enveloped by dust clouds, leading to health problems,” said  , a villager.
