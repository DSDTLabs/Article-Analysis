VELLORE:   is not new to Indians and it was a phenomenon several centuries ago in ancient India. The exhibits of tiniest coins, weighing from 0.19 to 0.50 gram, in circulation during the   at the three-day numismatic and philatelic exhibition support the theory of many intellectuals that nanotechnology might have originated from India.

 “I have 12 nano coins. The smallest coin weighs just 0.19 gram. It carries the first Telugu letter of ruler Bukka Raya. It is quite an amazing thing and a proof that nanotechnology has its origin from India,” said A Tamilvannan, secretary of the Numismatic and Philatelic Association of   Fort, who was the proud owner of a series of tiniest coins minted during the 13th century at the exhibition. He also put on display eight of 12 coins from the Vijayanagar period. “I have been searching for answers as to when and how the coins were minted and the first letter of the ruler was inscribed on them. If I am able to get the facts, it will establish that nanotechnology, a buzzword in the last couple of decades, existed and was practised during the 13th century,” he said. He also displayed hundreds of coins minted during   period, Ramanad Talawai with Tamil scripts and several other rare collections.
