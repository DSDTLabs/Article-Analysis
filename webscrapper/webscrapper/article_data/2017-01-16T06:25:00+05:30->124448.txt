Nagpur: Industry experts on Sunday asked students not to give up even during their toughest phase during a   discussion on ‘Make in India’ on the concluding day of Platinum Jubilee celebration of Laxminarayan Institute of Technology ( ).

 Unlike Day Two when panellists coaxed students to first complete higher studies, experts told students to get going right away on their chosen path. “Initially people may call you mad or crazy but don’t get hassled. Once you hit upon a good idea there will be a long queue of the same people wanting to fund your project,” was the advice of the day from the experts. 
 
 The panellists included vice president of Reliance Industries Ltd Vinayak Marathe, Ruchi Soya Ltd’s Anil Lonkar, Suman Syndets Ltd’s Ramesh Tarale, Vinamax Organics Ltd’s Vikas Tople and Indian Food & Ingredients’s Anil Tikalkar. 
 
 Marathe said India’s GDP is slated for a rapid growth by 2030 which will open up countless opportunities. “There is need for engineers who will work for others and there is need for engineers who want to do something of their own. When I started my career, owning a refrigartor took a long time. Now, you can buy one in your first salary itself. When the GDP grows, I think you would be able to buy a car right after getting first pay.”
 
 Lonkar exhorted students to set up   even before completing studies. “Start up means starting from zero. It is something new and something different. You need to identify business potential from everyday life. Look around, there’s something missing. Just find out a service or solution for filling this missing factor,” he said.
