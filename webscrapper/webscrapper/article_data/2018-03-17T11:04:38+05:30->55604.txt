DHARAMSHALA: Amid worsening relations of   and India government, the former was facing protest from Tibetans itself. 

 Indian government's recent move of asking its senior leaders and dignitaries had already scrapped various Tibetan events planned in Delhi.
 
 On Saturday, number of protestors gathered near the Tibetan parliament protesting against  , the president of   (CTA).
 
 These were the members of the group Truth-Seeking Volunteers holding protest against Lobsang Sangay, leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile- Sikyong, following a rift between him and former speaker of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile Penpa Tsering.
 
 The protesters seek the impeachment of Tibetan PM Sangay for actions which, they say, are akin to those of a dictator.
 
 They are also seeking a reply from Sangay and his cabinet for terminating the services of Penpa Tsering, former representative of the office of   in Washington from the office.
 
 Tsering was sacked from the office on November 7, 2017, 15 months after his appointment. It is believed that the cause of Tsering's ouster was that he raised the issue of a $ 1.5-million loan taken from the Tibet Fund in New York to purchase a new office in Washington.
 
 Sangay had clarified in the parliament that $ 1.5 million was not a loan but a grant.
 
 Thinley Kelsang, a protester, called for Sangay's impeachment and said he had taken many decisions without the approval of the Tibetan parliament. There were enough reasons for his impeachment, he said.
 
 A petition for his impeachment was submitted to members of parliament, which is holding its 10-day budget session.
 
 The protesters from India, Nepal, Europe, and the US gathered at the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) premises. The protest will go on until the session ends on March 24.
