We start the New Year with a bang of determination that this time we will fulfill our resolution. One week into the year and you can see the ambition fade away. Yes, there is no foolproof way that we can lose weight instantly but all it takes is willpower and a plan. A plan curated by an expert which consists of 10 steps to reduce body fat percentage!

 Nutritionist Karishma Chawla lays down 10 steps of how one can reduce their unwanted fat and get more fit than ever!
 
 1. Increase physical expenditure with an increase in the number of hours of workout in a week and indulge in a high-intensity workout.
 
 2. Build more muscle: One of the best ways to reduce body fat % is to indulge in weight training. Increase your lean mass and burn more calories.
 
 3. Avoid refined carbohydrates like white rice and maida. These are energy dense foods with no nutritional value. Replace them with whole grains which give steady energy with least calories.
 
 4. Enjoy your protein, consume complete lean protein like egg whites, low-fat milk and milk products. Lean meat is great for muscle repair and growth.
 
 5. Eat more veggies and low G1 fruits: These are thermogenic and help in bringing the fat percentage down.
 
 6. Hydrate yourself throughout the day. Thirst is a late indicator of dehydration and a dehydrated body cannot burn fat.
 
 7. Kitchen makeover: Replace the junk foods lying on the shelf with healthy foods like fruits, nuts, eggs and salads. These will act as fillers when hungry.
 
 8. Eliminate sugar and alcohol from the diet.
 
 9. Get your medical checkup done once in a year to address any underlying problem that could hinder your fat loss.
 
 10. Watch what you eat in terms of portion sizes and quality. Before you ingest any food, ask yourself: Is this going to help me achieve my goal or detract from it?
