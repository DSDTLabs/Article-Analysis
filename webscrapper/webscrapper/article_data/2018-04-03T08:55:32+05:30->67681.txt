PANAJI:  , who said they would meet Goa police on Monday, said the announcement was an April Fool’s prank they played on police. Police, however, were geared for any eventuality and deployed around 40 police personnel at the   police station to prevent any untoward incident.

 On Sunday, mining dependents had announced that they would meet Goa police with regards to the summons issued to over 40 protesters of the March 19 agitation staged by them. 
 
 President All   told TOI that for the last five years the government has “made us run around and yesterday (April 1) we decided to make government authorities run around”.
 
 “We have been able to successfully prank the authorities,”   said, adding that they knew authorities would be spurred into action “when they read (in newspapers) that mining dependents will be coming to Panaji to question the police about the summons”. 
 
 Two weeks ago, mining dependents had staged a protest in Panaji against the closure of mining operations in the state and the government’s failure to find a solution to the mining imbroglio. The protest had witnessed a lot of ruckus and misbehaviour on the part of protesters. The national highway was also blocked for several hours, severely inconveniencing the public. 
 
 Two days after the massive blockade, nearly 40 protesters were issued summons by Panaji police. Fearing possible arrest, many filed of anticipatory bail, which police opposed.
