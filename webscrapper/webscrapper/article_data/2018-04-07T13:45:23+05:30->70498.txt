MADURAI: At a time when youths from Tamil Nadu are coming out with flying colours, the lukewarm response from the state government towards the sport has been letting down budding players. Being an expensive sport, many promising players are forced to shun it as they are unable to afford it. 

 “I have seen at least a couple of my friends leaving the sport as they could not afford it. Those who pursue the sport are also under pressure as their parents have to invest a lot in it,” said a sportsperson who had won laurels at the international level. It requires a minimum of Rs 3 lakh to own a decent rifle to pursue 3 position rifle competitions. In addition, Rs 3 lakh more is required to buy cartridge for a year. “We have to use inferior quality ammunition during practice and better ones during competition to cut cost. At times it proves ineffective in determining the result,” says P  , a shooter himself and father of G Varsha, a budding talent. 
 
 States like Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab have been encouraging the sport. The governments in these states have ensured good infrastructure while cash prize is also given to those who have left their mark at the international level. However, such measures have been missing in Tamil Nadu. Ajaey Nithish and  , who won the silver and bronze medals in the junior category in 2016 are yet to be recognized by the state government. 
 
 According to Madurai rifle club secretary Vel Shankar, in the absence of government support, the infrastructure was being developed with the help of only donors. Things would have been much better had the government chipped in with support. “The state government in 2014 announced a shooting range at Chennai at a cost of Rs 40 crores. It also announced development of a shooting range in Madurai and Coimbatore at Rs 2 crore each. The announcements are still on paper,” he said.
