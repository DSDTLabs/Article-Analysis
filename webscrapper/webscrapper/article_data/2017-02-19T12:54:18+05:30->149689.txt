THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Fort police on Saturday arrested a 35-year-old man on charges of sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl. The police identified the accused as Manikantan. 

 Police said the incident took place on November 14, 2016. The accused was very close to the girl’s family and had enjoyed the freedom to visit her house any time. On the particular day, when the accused visited the house, there was no one else except the girl present there. He attempted to commit sexual acts on the girl, which resulted in bleeding from the child’s private part. Following this, the accused stuffed cotton to clean up the blood. But weeks later, the girl developed infection in the region, following which her mother took her to a doctor. It was the doctor, who found out about the torture faced by the girl. 
 
 The accused went absconding after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint. Following this, a special team was formed under Fort circle inspector V Rejikumar to nab the accused. On Saturday, the accused was arrested based on a tip-off received by Fort assistant commissioner K S Gopakumar. The accused was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.
