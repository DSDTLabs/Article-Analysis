VADODARA:   Chauhan, BJP heavyweight in Panchmahal district and son of BJP MP Prabhatsinh Chauhan, was rushed to a multi-speciality hospital in the city after he suffered a brain haemorrhage. Pravinsinhâ€™s condition was critical and he was put on life-support system on Tuesday night.

 Pravinsinh, who carries a Robinhood-like image in   and Kalol talukas of the district, is credited with the performance of the party in the region in the recent assembly polls. His wife   was granted the ticket for the Kalol assembly seat and won there. Pravinsinh is also credited with the victory of the party on the Godhra seat.
 
 Sources said that Pravinsinh was suffering from serious kidney ailments and had gone to a hospital in Godhra for treatment on Monday and fell down there. He suffered a head injury and it came to light that he had a brain haemorrhage. He was rushed to another private hospital for treatment but was then referred to a multi-speciality hospital in Vadodara.
 
 Pravinsinh had a series of offences including those for bootlegging registered against him before 2007, but had largely stayed away from controversies after that. He was involved in a row with his father over the ticket for the Kalol constituency when Suman was granted a ticket but Prabhatsinh had insisted that his partner Rangeshwari should be granted a ticket.
