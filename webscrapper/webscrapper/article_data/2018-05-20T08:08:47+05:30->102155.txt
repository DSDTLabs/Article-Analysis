AHMEDABAD: The city’s weather leaves people dizzy and dehydrated. The situation is worse for pet dogs, particularly those that have been bred for cold regions. Veterinary doctors across the city are busy attending to furry patients with heatstroke. Breeds such as Siberian Husky, Saint Bernard, Doberman, Rottweiler and Pug are particularly vulnerable. 

 
 Dr  , a veterinary doctor, said, “The natural habitat of most of these breeds is cold; a few live in countries where snow is common. Such breeds fall prey to heat-related illnesses including vomiting, acidity, and dehydration.” Most of these dogs are kept in air-conditioned environment, she said. “However, the minute they are taken out for walks in the blistering heat, they face sudden temperature shocks,” she said.
 
 Doctors say that extreme temperatures may lead to problems such as tick fever, urinary stones, and bacterial skin infections. “Tick fever is common among imported breeds and it causes nasal bleeding,” said  , a veterinary surgeon.
