BENGALURU: AIADMK leader  , who is serving a four-year term in a Bengaluru jail in a disproportionate case, is turning a Kannadathi. The incarcerated   leader is learning Kannada, prison sources said.

 Sasikala is attending classes held under the   at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara, and is being taught alphabets, basic reading ability and pronunciation. Apart from Kannada reading and writing, Sasikala is also learning basics of computer science.
 
 Keeping Sasikala company in the Kannada classes is her sister-in-law and fellow convict in the same DA case, J Ilavarasi. Sources say the AIADMK leader is being outperformed by   during internal assessments.
 
 However, sources say that is no reflection on Sasikala’s potential since the exam has a oral component. “Sasikala was on ‘mounavrata’ (vow to remain silent) during assessments. So she did not reply to oral questions,” sources said. “But she is doing well in writing.” The duo will receive participation certificates for having attended the course.
 
 The AIADMK leader also has a healthy interest in books. Currently, the jail library is in the section for male inmates, but thanks to Sasikala’s interest, prison authorities and the department of libraries are now set to open a new library exclusively for women prisoners.
 
 “Two more libraries will be launched in the prison, one for male undertrials and another for women inmates,” sources said. “The library department will spend Rs 30,000 more to buy 91 newspapers and monthly/weekly magazines for the women’s library alone. Sasikala played a key role in getting the library for women inmates sanctioned. She has taken personal interest in arranging the racks. The library will be opened shortly.”
