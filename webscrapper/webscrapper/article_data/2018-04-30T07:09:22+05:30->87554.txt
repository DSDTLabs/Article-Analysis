KOLKATA: The lull after Friday night’s thundershower made the mercury climb steadily on Sunday. Though Sunday’s maximum temperature at 35o C was on the normal mark, the fact that it was tad higher than Saturday’s 33.7 degree C left Kolkatans complaining about the scorcher. But Met office spies rain will ultimately checkmate the rising mercury.

 
 “There is a high possibility of thundershowers in Kolkata and large part of south   from Monday,” said GK Das, Regional Meteorological Centre director.
 
 A cyclonic circulation over eastern   and   and another over UP is expected to bring rain. This has resulted in high moisture incursion, pushing up the humidity level but also making the chances of rain bright.
 
 According to the Met office, Kolkata may see two spells of thundershowers the next four days. Some places might get moderate rain.
