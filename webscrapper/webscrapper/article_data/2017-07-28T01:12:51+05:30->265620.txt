NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party has accused the opposition of trying to embroil its MLAs in   in an attempt to tarnish the party’s image. Senior party member Atishi Marlena said that the high court had refused to entertain an affidavit against 10 MLAs filed by two people who had been sentenced to a month in prison by Delhi assembly for creating ruckus in the House.

 “The two claimed that they had been beaten up by the 10 MLAs after the incident in the House. However, the complaint was made with the sole aim of maligning the image of these MLAs. The party is considering taking legal recourse in this matter,” said Marlena.
 
 In another matter, Marlena said the court had quashed a molestation complaint against another   MLA from Deoli, Prakash Jarwal. She claimed that Delhi Police had been acting under orders from   and filing frivolous cases against its MLAs, most of which were dismissed by court.
 
 “The latest is a false and baseless case registered by a female activist of BJP against Jarwal. Delhi Police filed a case against Jarwal under IPC Section 354 in complete violation of procedure and norms. Quashing of the complaint by the court on Thursday has reinforced the fact that Delhi Police is being misused by its political masters to sully the image of AAP,” Marlena said.
 
 Marlena added that AAP will not bend its knees before an onslaught against its MLAs under any circumstances. “Now that the court has quashed the complaint against Jarwal, who will compensate for the psychological ordeal he and his family have had to suffer? Is the regime of vendetta politics being played out against AAP and its MLAs ethical?” she asked.
