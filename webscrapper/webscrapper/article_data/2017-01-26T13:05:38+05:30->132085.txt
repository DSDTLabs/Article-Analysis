NAGPUR: If you are a   and bike enthusiast, then Nagpur is the place to be this Sunday.   on wheels will be rolling down the city   by TOI. 

 Shahrukh Cassad, founder-member of   said, “There will be about 25 four wheelers and 10 two wheelers participating in the rally. It is going to be a delight for Nagpurians to see these cars in action. These are beautiful vehicles that were made to last. Even today when you see them on road it will reflect the glory and glamour of the era they belong to.”
 
 The oldest car registered for the rally is truly a blast from the past, a 1936 Morris 8 Tourer that will hit the streets in all its grandeur. 
 
 It’s also expected that a   will also participate in the rally thus giving it a ‘complete’ feel with oldies from both two and four wheelers making their presence felt. 
 
 Vintage vehicles maintain their roadworthiness thanks to regular maintenance and major restorations. Restoration of an automobile means making it look exactly the way it was on the day that car rolled out of the factory. 
 
 While restoring a car, using modifications or adding your own personal touch is a strict no-no because the original design has to be copied in detail. It is a puritan’s field where nothing less than perfection is acceptable.
 
 In rallies where prizes are given, judges look at which parts were replaced and which restored. Replacing parts with originals is an extremely difficult task because their production stopped decades ago, so sourcing has to be done from manufacturers in India or abroad who make replicas. 
 
 For Nagpurians, to watch these motorized beauties during the public display (SEE BOX) before the rally will be a sight to behold. Owners or caretakers will be sharing history of the vehicles and their design.
