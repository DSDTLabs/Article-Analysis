LUCKNOW: BJP's Agra MLA Jagan Prasad   has complained of "massive corruption" in the Agra Municipal Corporation, alleging that various officials, including the municipal commissioner, are making money off infrastructure projects. 

  In his letter to CM Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, Governor Ram Naik and urban development minister  , the MLA has alleged that officials have been found to be charging up to 30% commission on projects. "I had been receiving several complaints from contractors that officials have been asking for and charging huge commission on infrastructure projects. While such corruption has been taking place for more than 15 years, the amount of commission being charged has gone up over the past few months. Because of so many complaints, I had the matter investigated and found that right from the level of the municipal commissioner to the various engineers and audit department are embroiled in corruption," Garg told TOI . 
 
 Having written the letter on May 4 and not having received a response, Garg came to Lucknow to meet Yogi or Khanna but was left disappointed. "The CM was in Karnataka and not available to speak on Thursday. The minister is not well and has been admitted to SGPGI. I visited him on Thursday and he assured me of strict action against whoever is found guilty. I will try to meet the CM on Friday after he is back from campaigning," he said.
