MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday issued notices to the Union and state governments seeking their response on a   which sought exemption of Goods and Services Tax ( ) on sanitary pads. Sanitary pads are to be taxed at 12%. The PIL is filed by   pointing out that only 12% of the menstruating women can afford sanitary napkins in India.

 Senior advocate Mihir Desai, appearing for the foundation, argued before a bench headed by the chief justice that “almost 90% women are unable to access the most hygiene product.” The judges directed notices to be issued to the Centre and state governments and posted the hearing after four weeks.
 
 According to the petition, imposition of 12% GST has a “devastating impact on the menstrual and reproductive health of girls and women in India.” It further stated, “Steps need to be taken by the government to increase the access of women to basic menstrual hygiene products in order to improve their health and protect their rights under Article 21 (Right to Life).”
