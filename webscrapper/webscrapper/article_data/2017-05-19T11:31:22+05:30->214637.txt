CHENNAI: Madras high court on Thursday declined to interfere with the proposed convocation of   on May 19, saying there is no legal embargo for the chancellor of the university to conduct the event.

 Justice M Govindaraj, before whom the writ petition was filed by the Anna University   to stay the proposed convocation function came up for hearing, further said: “There is nothing in the statue to substantiate the arguments advanced by counsel that only an academician should hold the post of vicechancellor.“
 
 He further said that syndicate committee, having been conferred with the powers of administrative functions, has power to conduct the convocation with any of the officers of the university.
 
 The association had assailed the convocation proposal saying that there was no quorum in the syndicate and that only two members out of 10 were available.
 
 It said its representation dated May 8, calling upon the government to appoint a vice-chancellor for the university first and then allow him to call for convocation had not evoked any response.
 
 There is no point in asking the chairman of the convener committee convene the convocation and sign the degrees, it said.
