KOLKATA: Calcutta University on Tuesday decided to clear several candidates who had failed in the Part I examinations owing to the new regulations brought into effect mid-session.

 Honours candidates are now required to secure 70 marks combining the two Honours papers and also get 30 marks in one of the two general papers. According to the 2009 regulation, that will now be brought back, 70 marks in Honours meant these students were considered promoted to second year even if they failed to clear both the general papers. Similarly, general degree course students are now required to secure 30 marks each in two of the three general (pass) papers, earlier it was only one. 
 
  
  
 
 With the old 2009 regulation being brought back as suggested by education minister  , many will now qualify for second year.
 
 Vice-chancellor   said, “The syndicate has resolved that the old regulation will be restored for academic year 2016-2017.” She added, “Exam regulations of 2016 will be effective from a date, which may be notified later.” Sources pointed out that students had taken admissions in the third week of July 2016. But the CU authorities confirmed the new regulations only by February 15, 2017.
 
 From Wednesday, new marksheets will be handed out to colleges by CU. “There is not much difference in the results of 2016 and 2017. The huge decrease in the pass percentage was because of the change in regulations,” pointed out the VC. 
 
 The varsity is returning to the old norms only for a year.
