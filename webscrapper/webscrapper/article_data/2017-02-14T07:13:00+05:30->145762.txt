Shimla: Shimla based sculptor professor M C Saxena has questioned the beautification drive launched by state tourism department by claiming that three   along the Mall Road, created by him 35 years back to showcase life and culture of Himachal Pradesh, have been damaged in the project. He said unprofessional hands are giving same treatment to these murals as retaining walls or rain shelters. 

 “These exclusive wall murals beautifully capture life and culture of Himachal like picking and packaging of apple in orchards, Gaddi (shepherd) lifestyle to tea gardens of Kangra and represent different belts of the hill state,” Saxena said. 
 
 These three sculptures are installed at three different spots on the Mall Road. The mural based on apple economy, was inaugurated by the then governor A K Banerjee.
 
 He said these murals have not only been captured by hundreds of travel enthusiasts in their travel blogs but have also featured in many prestigious documentary films by Indian and foreign film-makers.
 
 Saxena claimed that in 2013, as a part of Shimla beautification project, he was assured he will be involved in renovation of these murals as no one else can do proper justice.
 
 “It is strange that in-spite of numerous discussions with me for past few years, the project has been outsourced to unprofessional team of rookies from some other state who have no knowledge of Himachali culture and nuances of the style in which the original sculptures were created,” he said.
 
 When contacted, joint director (tourism) Dr Manoj Sharma said no damage is caused to the murals and proper care is being taken in their restoration. “People who have been assigned the work know their job and these murals would come out more beautifully when restoration would be completed,” he said.
