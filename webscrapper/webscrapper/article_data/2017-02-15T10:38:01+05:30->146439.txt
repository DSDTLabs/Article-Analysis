GUNTUR: The district-level screening committee ( ) headed by the joint collector has recommended cancellation of the Scheduled Caste status of late research scholar   and his family.

 Vemula was studying at the   (UoH) when he committed suicide in January, 2016.
 
 The DLSC report urged the district collector to declare Rohith and his family members as members of the Odde (Vad- dera) community (BC-A) and annul the certificates allotting them the SC status.
 
 “DLSC has conclusively concluded that Rohith and his family belong to the Vaddera (BC-A) community, and not SC as declared in the past. Hence, all certificates granting them SC status will be cancelled,” said collector  , who issued a final show-cause notice to Rohith’s mother Radhika, brother Raja Chaitanya Kumar and sister Neelima soon after receiving the DLSC report. Dande had given them 15 days to file responses.
 
 Dande said DLSC had come to the conclusion after recording the statements of officials and all family members of Rohith. The district administration has also decided to cancel the family’s other certificates which had not come to their notice. The collector said the DLSC had vetoed the certificates issued by the Guntur urban tehsildar granting Rohith, Radhika, Neelima and Raja SC status in the past.
 
 Interestingly, Dande had stated last January before the   that Rohith belonged to the SC community. Dalit activists suspect there was enormous pressure on the district administration to declare Rohith as belonging to the Backward Class category. “What is the point in declaring Rohith as a BC at this juncture?” former minister and TDP leader Dokka Manikya Varaprasad sought to know. 
 
 Dande said all certificates possessed by the Vemula kin were fraudulently procured and hence were liable for cancellation.
