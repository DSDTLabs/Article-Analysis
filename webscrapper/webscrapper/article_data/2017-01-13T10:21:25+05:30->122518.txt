KOLKATA: Following a   order, the Kolkata Police on Thursday denied RSS the permission to hold a rally either on   or at   on January 14.

 “RSS has been asked to come up with an alternative date for the rally,“ said a top IPS officer. Officers claimed with Gangasagar Mela slated for the same day, it would be difficult for them to tackle another gathering in the heart of the city. “They can choose the venue and time of their rally on any other date,“ the officer added.
 
 RSS senior functionaries later told reporters they would move court on Friday so that the rally could be held on the scheduled date.
 
 The HC on Wednesday observed the citizens' right to assemble could not be curtailed if they carried it out peacefully and told the police chief to consider the RSS's application to let them hold an event on Brigade Parade Ground on Saturday.
