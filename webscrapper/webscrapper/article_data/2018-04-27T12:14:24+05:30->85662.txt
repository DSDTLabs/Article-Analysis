INDORE: The civic body is going to develop   as ‘Ideal Road’ of the city. 

 The stretch will have lush greenery to help reduce air pollution. The project would be executed at an estimated cost of Rs3cr. It includes a selfie zone and plantation of different trees, especially those that help in reducing air pollution. While the selfie zone will be developed near a Nursing Home on this road, the stretch will have green cover at two locations including a bus stand in the area. 
 
 “We have prepared a separate plan for development of this road. Apart from selfie zone, it will have plantation, lightings and landscaping work. The plantation will include trees that absorb pollutants the most,” said head of IMC’s traffic and transportation department Dilip Sharma. 
 
 Sharma said that plantation would be done along the footpath and behind the selfie point. “This whole project is being executed with help of consultants and we are hoping to complete it within four to six months,” he said. 
 
 Officials of garden department said that common trees like Kaakad, Neem, Banyan, Pipal etc that absorb pollutants would be planted. “Besides carbon di oxide, these trees also absorb other pollutants. Particulate matters get deposited on the leaves and are washed away during rains,” said  , a senior official with IMC’s garden department. 
 
 Joshi said that they are yet to finalize locations, where these trees would be planted as they require large space. The stretch will also have ornamental plants like golden bottle brush topiary, ophiopogon and carpet grass for beautification. 
 
 “We are working on site planning, and plantation work would be carried out as per space available,” he added. 
 
 Besides, there would be a sculpture with the slogan ‘My Indore’ at the selfie point along with wall painting, messages on Swachch Indore and plantation work to maintain greenery.
