MOTIHARI: Many   practitioners in East Champaran district are on the receiving end of threat calls and extortion demands from gangsters in the state these days. To protest against the deteriorating law and order, they took out a rally on Monday from the local Indian Medical Association (IMA) office to the office of district magistrate and the SP wearing black badges.

 The doctors were carrying placards and shouting slogans like —``police prashasan hai hai” and “aparadhiyo ko giraftar karo”. 
 
 It may be recalled that during the last four days, three doctors received extortion calls and were asked to pay ‘rangdari’ or face dire consequences. Two noted doctors— Dr T P Singh and Dr Chandranshu— even lodged cases with the Town and Chhatauni police stations and Dr Dinesh Bhagat of Rajepur lodged a case with the Rajepur police station in this regard. 
 
 Dr Singh, a noted physician and senior doctor, received a letter and call from one Kunal Singh , a dreaded criminal, and was asked to pay Rs 10 lakh. Dr Chandranshu, a young surgeon also received an extortion call on Sunday and was asked to pay Rs 5 lakh ‘rangdari’ or face consequences.
 
 When the doctors reached the DM office he was not present there. Hence the delegation led by Dr Niraj Sinha submitted a memorandum to DDC Sunil Kumar. The doctors have also threatened to go on indefinite strike if the criminals were not arrested soon.
 
 Thereafter the delegation also submitted a memorandum to S P Jitendra Rana and demanded immediate arrest of the criminals. The SP assured the delegation that they would be booked soon and olice teams are conducting raids to nab them after examination of call detail reports. “Bodyguards have been provided to these doctors for their protection,” said the SP.
 
 According to police sources, it has been detected that a VIP number has been used to make extortion calls to Dr Chandranshu and police are investigating the case.
