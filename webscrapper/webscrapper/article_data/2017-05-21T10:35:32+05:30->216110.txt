NEW DELHI:   sources indicated on Saturday that the board will have to take into account "notional profit and loss" before determining the revised compensation for national cricketers. Indian captain   is meeting the   (CoA) on Sunday to discuss the issue.

 Sources said BCCI is not looking at a fixed amount to be compensated to the cricketers straight away. It intends to work out a percentage after exhaustive calculations and then take a call whether to continue with the existing system of doling out 26 per cent from BCCI's revenues (gross earning from such sources like sale of sponsorship rights, media rights, receipt of tour guarantees among others) to the cricketers or not. If BCCI's gross earning increases, the share of the cricketers goes up. However, Indian cricketers have termed the 26 per cent payment distribution system unscientific and want a bigger share in the pie.
 
 The CoA cannot give 100 per cent assurance to the players right away. The board will need to account for the numbers of liabilities like paying penalties and compensating the aggrieved stakeholders with whom BCCI has been entangled in legal battles.
 
 The silver lining is that BCCI's income from the   is likely to go up by several folds when the media rights for the next five years are sold. Right now, BCCI makes around Rs 20 crore for every IPL match and with 60 matches played every season, the board makes Rs 1,200 crore from the IPL annually.
 
 If the percentage of players' income has to be increased, it has to be approved by the board's general body. And if the cricket board's gross revenue comes down, the board members may not be in agreement to offer any hike to the cricketers.
