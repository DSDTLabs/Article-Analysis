TRICHY: A major   drive was carried out at   on the outskirts of   on Friday. The state highways department led the drive following an order from the Madurai bench of Madras high court to remove encroachments in the municipality. 

 The department had issued notice to the shops to remove the encroachments put up by them along the stretches of state highways before July 20. Acting on the notice, many shop owners removed the encroachments on their own. They removed the sheds outside the shops and pavements for two feet to 20 feet, that were creating obstructions to the traffic movement. On Friday, the official team cleared out small encroachments that had been left by the vendors. 
 
 The roads leading from Manapparai town to Madurai, Dindigul, Kovilpatti, Pudukkottai, Viralimalai and Trichy are dotted with around 1,000 shops. Being a junction where people come from hundreds of villages in the area, Manapparai handles thousands of people, four wheelers and two wheelers daily. The encroachments by the shops on the roads had been causing inconvenience to the movement of the vehicles. 
 
 Seven years ago, the state highways department had cracked down on the encroachments and removed them. However, the failure to take up follow-up action led to the recurrence of the encroachment at the same place. 
 
 “The highways department had evicted the encroachments seven years ago, but they failed to take control of the places and lay roads. Hence, the encroachments gradually came back and caused severe inconvenience to the people. Now, it is time for them to utilise the opportunity to widen the road and stop the encroachments,” said CPI town secretary of Manapparai K Mohammed Hussain.
 
 The drive is expected to continue for a few more days, following which the highways department would submit a status report to the court.
