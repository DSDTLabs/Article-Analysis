Ryan Reynolds’s life may come across as glitzy and glamorous, he sure didn't have the easiest upbringing. The ‘Deadpool 2’ reportedly grew up in a lower-middle-class family in Vancouver, the youngest of four boys. Reynolds had earlier reportedly spoken about how he had a troubled relationship with his father. His father, who died in 2015 after battling  , was really good yet difficult to be with.

  Recalling the early days, Reynolds reportedly averred that this isn’t just meant to be some sob story—everyone carries their own bag of rocks around and he is no different in that regard—but growing up in his house, it was never relaxing or easy. He further added that he has dealt with anxiety throughout his life. 
 
 He further revealed that his anti- complacency pill did help otherwise; he used to start to get a little bummed. Reynolds also accredited that his escape might also be the comedy projects. 
 He averred that he’d look for the joke in things so that he doesn’t look for the sadness and the grief. He added that his brothers and he are all extremely close and they all share a bit of that type of humor together.
 
 Further talking about his fallout with his dad, Reynolds said that his wife   assisted and contributed for him to repair the damages. According to the actor, Blake has a gift for foresight.
 After their reconciliation, the couple named their first daughter after his father. He reportedly said that it felt right and that all family relationships come with some complications. 
 
 For better or worse, all roads lead to here. He further added that at the end of the day, it's easier to focus on the good stuff than the bad. 
 
 Reynolds said that his father died soon after my daughter was born, but he got to see her, which makes him happy.
