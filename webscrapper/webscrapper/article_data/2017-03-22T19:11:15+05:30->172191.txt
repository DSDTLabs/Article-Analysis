 The film is based on a real life story, and revolves around the journey of Coimbatore-based Arunachalam Muruganantham, who invented a low-cost sanitary pad making machine for women in his small village. 
 
 Menstruation is still considered a taboo by some sections of the society and at a recent tête-à-tête with TOI Entertainment, Twinkle spoke about how she never understood the logic behind hushing over the term ‘periods’ and why she chose to walk off the beaten path with the kind of cinema she is producing. 
 
 "It is a subject I believe in. It's a subject that I have written extensively about. Menstruation is a taboo not just in our country but all over the world. It's not something which is openly discussed and I really don't see the logic in it. It's a biological function, why should there be shame around it. That is what I am trying and hoping to describe through ‘Padman’,” she shared. 
 
 The actress even went on to talk about her experience of shooting the first leg of the film in Maheshwar admitting “the shoot is going really well” and that she is “very happy to be a part of the project.”
