THANE: Sporting joggers shoes and armed with gloves and litter bags in hand, over 100 runners and morning walkers in the lake city stepped into the neglected littered pockets around   lake at the foothills of Yeoor forest to lend a helping hand for the unique jogging-cum- clean-up movement called ‘Plogging’ on Sunday morning.

 The army of close to 110 joggers, morning walkers and students flocked to Upvan lake from 6am and cleaned up around 2.5km stretch picking up about a truck full of plastic, glass, wrappers and other waste they could during the next three hours.
 
 “I have been trying to keep walking areas clean as part of the Swachh Bharat mission since November. However, when I participated in this drive I saw hundreds of like-minded youth and adults who have taken up  . This is much required in our city and I plan to be an active part of this movement,” said 61-year-old Dilip Shingare. 
 
 While plogging was conceptualised by   from   last year, it has actively been replicated globally thereafter and was introduced to Thane joggers by city-based NGOs,   and Yeoor Environmental Society. 
 
 Speaking about this movement, founder of Earthkids NGO   said, “A few months ago I read about the concept of plogging and realised that Upvan area sees hundreds of frequent joggers hence and decided to pilot this movement in our lake city.”
