CHENNAI:   advocate-general   has written to the   (BCI) stating that 'certain vested interests' were trying to derail the election to   and Puducherry.

 In a letter addressed to BCI chairman   on Monday, Vijay   questioned the criteria adopted for appointment of special committee members who would run the council after the term of the elected office-bearers and said, "While the   has set a deadline for the elections, and it is my intention to honour that order in letter and spirit, certain vested interests are trying to delay the election."
 
 Apart from governing the daily affairs of the council, the most important task of the special committees is to conduct an election as soon as possible, Vijay Narayan said, adding that two advocates (  and Chandrasekaran) had been nominated by BCI as special committee members. "While I have great respect and regard for both of them, subsequent events have made me believe that both are acting at the behest of S Prabakaran, a candidate at the forthcoming election, who is the state bar council nominee to the BCI, who styles himself as co-chairperson of BCI, a post which is not sanctioned by law."
 
 Expressing his willingness to disassociate himself from the process of conducting election, Vijay Narayan said it would be expedient to appoint a retired judge of the high court, in consultation with the chief justice of the Madras high court, to oversee the electoral process. 
 
 "In view of schism in the committee, and in view of the fact that the advocate-general has been reduced to a minority, I have grave apprehensions on my ability to conduct free and fair elections," Vijay Narayan said.
