It was in 1989 that Steven Sodenberghs's cult movie Sex, lies and video tapes was released. A movie of betrayal, voyeurism and lust it exposed the social ills and perversions of the Deep South.

 The arrest of   may at first look as a personal story of vengeance, power and psychopathic machismo, but it is actually a deeper reflection of the society we live in.
 
 Movies portray fragmented mirrors of large than life images. They never tell you the truth which lies entangled in a web of falsehood. Dileep's visage of innocence personified crumbled as details of the sordid case came out, one after the other, in the last few weeks.
 
 To put the blame around Dileep for all the ills in the film industry would be to whitewash what many bigwigs have been silently doing for years together.
 
 The existence of casting couch has never been officially acknowledged by the Malayalam film industry. It was after the brutal rape of an actress that several actresses came in open and spoke openly about it. The passive silence of the victim after the crime was registered, even as she was insulted by a section of her colleagues, shows how difficult life can be for a victim to come back into the mainstream society.
 
 Dileep for long had been a darling of the media but after the news of his possible involvement in the conspiracy began to trickle in he managed to bring senior colleagues including superstars behind him, many of them who vented their ire on the media for targeting an `innocent' actor. For once, the media, which many a times have gone overboard in their news coverage in many events, took a very clear stand and tracked the story day after day. The superstars, and their second fiddles, should understand that instead of shooting the messenger they should clean up their own backyard.
 
 The cleansing would not only be good for the Malayalam film industry in the long run, but for common folks who idolise its icons like demi-gods.
