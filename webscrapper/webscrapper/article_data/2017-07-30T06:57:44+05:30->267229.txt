"Workers should not get annoyed at any cost," Shah told ministers during a meeting at the party office on Saturday evening. 

 He also asked the ministers to allot Monday and Tuesday for party workers in the secretariat. "Ministers should utilise the rest of five days for touring their assigned districts and completing departmental work," Shah said.
 
 Earlier, at a meeting with the BJP workers at  , Shah had told them that they should not be visible at secretariat barring these two days. "Once two days of meeting are fixed for public and party workers, no minister would meet them on other days," he said.
