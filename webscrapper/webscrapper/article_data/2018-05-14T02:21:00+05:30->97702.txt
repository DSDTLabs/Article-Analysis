Vizianagaram: Madhu Siva, one of the two main accused in the   of electrical engineer Y Gowrishankar, was nabbed by Vizianagaram police six days after the murder took place in Parvathipuram division, near the ITDA park close to Thotapalli.

 Addressing members of the media, here on Sunday, district SP, G Pala Raju said Siva was found in Anakapalli, where he had fled and taken shelter immediately after the murder.
 
 Presenting the facts of the case, the SP observed that all the six accused have now been arrested. Shedding light on new facts, Pala Raju observed that the duo, Siva and Y Saraswati, wife of murdered Gowrishankar, had hatched the plan to kill him in Karnataka, where he was working, even before the marriage took place. The SP noted that the duo had given Rs 25,000 to a gang in Bangalore, asking them to kill the victim. The gangsters, however, had failed and Gowrishankar and Saraswati were married.
 
 They then hatched a new plot to murder Gowrishankar. Siva planned to present himself as a bridegroom willing to marry the young widow once the young electrical engineer was dead. The police added that the two accused met and fell in love in 2016. 
 
 Siva has been remanded to judicial custody, after which further investigations would be conducted.
