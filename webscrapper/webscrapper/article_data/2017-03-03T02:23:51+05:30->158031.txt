LUCKNOW: For poll pundits, the declining turnout over the fi ve phases could be an indicator of which way the poll breeze is blowing.

 Poll percentage dipped from 64% in the fi rst phase in west UP to 57% in east UP in phase fi ve. This, indicative of a growing indifference of voters towards the election, could disturb calculations of the major parties.
 
 In the fi rst phase that covered Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut and Ghaziabad districts with large populations of Muslims and Jats, poll percentage was a healthy 64.2%, making it clear that the wounds of the communal riots of 2013 still hurt. Killing of Akhlaq in Gautam Buddh Nagar for consuming and storing meat that was allegedly ‘beef’ became a pan-India issue in 2015, further deepening the divide.
 
 In phase two, mostly in Rohilkhand comprising Bareilly, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Badaun and Rampur districts, turnout rose to 65.2%. These districts too have signifi cant Muslim populations who voted in large numbers along with Hindus. “There is no denying that there is no Muslim MP in UP’s 80   constituencies. That could be a reason for their bid to vote in large numbers and stall   from power in the UP assembly,” says political scientist Ashutosh Mishra.
 
 As voting moved to central and east UP, voters displayed some indifference. In 2012 assembly polls, 57% voted. In 2017, 57.4% was the turnout. East UP is the state’s most backward region and has seen a great degree of out-migration. Tiny land holdings, fl ood-ravaged fi elds and limited jobs are major hardships.
 
 Elections don’t seem to change conditions; people stay away from the polling process. To involve the poor in the election, parties have incited caste and communal feelings. When PM Modi raised the terror attack at Gonda at the heart of eastern UP, it seemed a clear bid to polarise the voter. Yet, people from this region seemingly remained unmoved: only 57% voted.
