LUCKNOW: With barely a month to go before the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh and a truce between the father and the son still eluding, the two factions of   have a daunting   for the forthcoming elections.

 With just a little over one months left for the date of nominations for the final phase of elections in UP, the sides seem to be running out of time. If they continue to be at the loggerheads, each factions will have to name 403 candidates.
 
 “It will be a Herculean task to find 800 Samajwadi candidates for the polls,” Bhagwati Yadav, an SP worker from Deoria, told TOI outside the SP headquarters in Lucknow. “And this time there will be no rebels as all will get tickets,” he added in a lighter vein.
 
 Both the warring factions have announced tickets. While Mulayam and his brother Shivpal Yadav have announced a list of 325 candidates, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav’s camp has made public 235 names of its choice. Earlier, Akhilesh handed over a list of 367 candidates to his father. Barring a few, most of the names are common in the two lists. 
 
 However, when Mulayam reportedly didn’t give any heed to the list suggested by Akhilesh, his camp made their own list public and the tussle between the two sides gained momentum. First Mulayam sacked Akhilesh and his chief adviser, Ram Gopal Yadav, but took them back the next day. 
 
 However, the CM camp went ahead with its plan to call a   at which delegates unanimously anointed Akhilesh the national president and nominated Mulayam the mentor of the party. The other two resolutions suggested sacking of general secretary Amar Singh and removal of Shivpal from the post of state party chief and a full-blown battle between the sides started.
 
 Now, with both factions sticking to their positions, uncertainty continues at the grassroots levels. Clashes have already broken out between rival groups in many districts.
