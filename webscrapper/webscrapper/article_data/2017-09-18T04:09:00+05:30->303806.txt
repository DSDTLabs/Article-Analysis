Ahmedabad: The brouhaha over VIP visits are over, even the prime minister has left for Delhi, but Amdavadis ask why are they still restricted to walk or cycle on the lower promenades of the Sabarmati Riverfront. 

 On Sunday many citizens were disappointed when they were turned away by the security guards who claimed that the promenades will be closed to public till ‘further orders’. When inquired, the west bank riverfront police chowky informed TOI that there are no VIP routes on the riverfront and that there was no instruction from the police commissioner to restrict entry of public. “I had come with my son to bicycle on the riverfront on Sunday and had to go back disappointed. Are we at the mercy of VIPs even after they have left?” asks Devendra Shah of Paldi. Satish Mandaviya, a visitor from Junagadh said, “I was in Ahmedabad for three days. But I could not visit the riverfront. When I came back on Sunday, I was sent back,” says Mandaviya. tnn
