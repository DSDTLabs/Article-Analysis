SURAT: A woman fought bravely with a   to rescue her six-year-old son from its jaws in Valod village of Tapi district in the early hours of Thursday. Rehan Shaikh suffered severe injuries on head and his right hand when the leopard tried to drag him out of the hut where he was asleep. 

 The leopard bit the child on the head and started to drag him out of the hut. The child started to scream, which woke up his mother  , who was sleeping besides him and her another child. She did not come to know when the leopard entered their hut. The woman started to scream even as she began to aggressively attack the leopard with a plastic bobbin lying in the hut. Her fierce reaction forced the leopard to release the child and escape. The leopard did not attack the woman or her younger child, but targeted only Rehan. 
 
 Apart from injuries on the head and a fracture in hand, Rehan had wounds on other parts of the body too. A bunch of hair and skin had come off from his head when the leopard held him by its jaws. Rehan was shifted to New Civil Hospital of Surat after first aid treatment at a local clinic. Rehan, who was critical when admitted, was operated upon by the doctors and has been placed under observation. 
 
 “We will install a cage at Valod where the leopard had attacked the child. The child suffered serious injuries and is hospitalized. The child’s house is located at a place close to the river. The leopard might have crossed the river and trespassed into the human habitat,” range forest officer, Mahuva, B B Parmar said.
 
 Many incidents of human-leopard conflict have been reported from the rural areas of the districts of south   in the recent past. However, no major attack had occurred in the last few months, sources said.
