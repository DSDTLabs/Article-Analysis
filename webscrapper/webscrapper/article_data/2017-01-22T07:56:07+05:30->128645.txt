According to sources the NGT had asked the MoEF to constitute a team comprising officials from the state government and the petitioners for an inspection on the number of trees felled and the re-plantation that has happened at Sakleshpur in Hassan district. 
 
 While the team was told that the report was not comprehensive, the state government was criticized for cutting trees even before the environmental impact assessment was ready. The bench asked Karnataka whether it had followed the suggestions given by the K Kasturirangan and Madhav Gadgil committees on Western Ghats before starting the project. 
 
 Counsel for Karnataka submitted that the government had asked the forest department to be ready with saplings to be planted during monsoon. The government has permission to cut 15,000 trees, but felled only 7,000 of them so far, counsel stated. 
 
 The Rs 12, 900 crore Yettinahole project envisages providing drinking water to over 68 lakh people in Bengaluru Rural, Ramangara, Kolar, Chikkaballapura and Tumakuru. Water from Yettinahole, a west-flowing stream, near Sakleshpur in Hassan district will be diverted for the project.
