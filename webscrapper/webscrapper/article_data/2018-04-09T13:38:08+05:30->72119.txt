NAGPUR: Detection branch of Ganeshpeth police station have nabbed a driver who had fled with Rs70 lakh cash belonging to his employer, at   near Aurangabad on Saturday late night.

 Cops have recovered Rs69.70 lakh from the accused, Nilesh Pakhle, 31, a driver of coal industrialist Nitin Upre. He had fled with the money along with his family on Friday afternoon. 
 
 Upre had told cops that on his directive Pakhle collected the cash from his friend Sham Mital’s car. The cash was to be taken to Upre’s residence in Godrej Anandam City. However, Pakhle parked Upre’s car at his place and took the money on his two-wheeler.
 
 Pakhle then went to his mother-in-law’s home in Ajni and asked his wife Priyanka to immediately reach Tukdoji Putla along with their two daughters as they were going to Shirdi. The accused then went to   in a hired SUV and stayed there at a lavish hotel.
 
 Pakhle’s phone had been switched off since he fled with the cash. Cops got a clue about his whereabouts after he switched on the phone for a few minutes in Amravati. Cops rushed to Amravati but when they reached the hotel the staff told them that the family had just left.
 
 Cops then received a tipoff that the accused is in Aurangabad. Cops learnt about his location after the accused again switched on his phone for a few minutes.
 
 Cops inquired at every hotel and motel on the way to Aurangabad. An employee of a hotel near Dusarbeed told cops that he had seen a family which had left the hotel few minutes ago. Cops followed the trail and intercepted the accused and his family.
 
 According to sources, Pakhle had switched on his cell phone in Aurangabad to mislead cops. “He had hired a car from Aurangabad for return journey to Nagpur. He planned to keep his family at a friend’s house in Saoner before deciding his next action,” the sources said.
 
 Cops said, he had been planning to flee with substantial amount of cash since last six-seven months.
