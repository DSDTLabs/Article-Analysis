PHULPUR(ALLAHABAD): In poll-bound Phulpur,   ratcheted up a re-run of series of temple visits, peddling a soft-Hindutva campaign theme witnessed in Gujarat assembly polls late last year.

 Its party candidate  , a Brahmin, wore a traditional dhoti and ‘janeu’ while also sporting a smeared forehead through out the last day of campaigning on Friday. The party went for several temple visits in the past 48 hours.
 
 On Friday, Mishra, along with UP Congress president Raj Babbar, went to the iconic Hanuman Temple on the banks of Sangam. The two were seen holding long prayers before the Hanuman idol, which is kept in a reclining position at the temple.
 
 Congress national president Rahul Gandhi’s templehopping across as many as 27 shrines in Gujarat, had triggered a war of words between BJP and his party, eventually helping the Congress increase their tally from 61 seats to
 
 77. Party’s Phulpur candidate rejected the allegations of soft- Hindutva taken by the Congress.
 
 “We all are God-fearing and God-loving people. We don’t need any lessons in describing our beliefs in religion. The BJP mocked Rahulji's temple visits. But the results of the election show that he was able to connect with people,” said Misra.
 
 On Saturday, Congress leaders had visited as many as four shrines in Allahabad, including Aindri Dham.
 
 Misra later also had a dinner with a dalit family.
 
 BJP leaders, too, had delivered Phulpur poll speeches around the recent budget allocations of more than Rs 1,000 crore towards the upcoming 2019 Kumbh mela and its preparations. Congress in the only recognised party to have fielded a Brahmin candidate in a seat that has equal caste-wise distribution of Brahmins, Kurmi Patels (OBCs), non-Yadav OBCs and Muslims.
