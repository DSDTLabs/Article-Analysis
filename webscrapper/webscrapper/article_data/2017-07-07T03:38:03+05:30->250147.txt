GREATER NOIDA: Twenty-one teams of police officers were formed by   Love Kumar to trace 132 missing children in GB Nagar district on Thursday. The measure marked the launch of Operation Muskan-III by Love Kumar on the directions of the ministry of home affairs.

 More than 100 children were reunited with their families after Operation Muskan-II was rolled out in July last year.
 
 Speaking to TOI, district SP (crime) Preeti Bala Gupta said 63 policemen would visit 16 districts of the state as well as neighbouring states to trace the kids, out of which some have been missing since 2007. “The main aim of the programme is to prevent child trafficking and rescue children from people who engage them in begging, flesh trade and other antisocial activities,” she said.
 
 In the first phase of the operation, police teams will visit shelter homes, railway stations and police stations in Kanpur, Meerut, Lucknow, Agra, Mathura, Aligarh and Haridwar, as well as Delhi and Gurgaon. “The teams will visit the spots where child beggars and labourers are most likely to be found,” Gupta said. She added that they would make use of social media in the second part of the campaign.
