NEW DELHI: With an eye on the forthcoming civic polls,   Ajay Maken on Tuesday hit out at  , the ruling party in the three corporations, and highlighted the “failure” of the AAP-led Delhi government in fufilling its promises. He alleged that “development works in Delhi have come to a halt”.

 Maken also demanded that the LG Anil Baijal must make public the three-member committee’s report on the   government’s decisions, which were allegedly taken without prior approval of then LG.
 
 Maken was addressing a Block   committee presidents’ convention at Constitution Club. He also launched a booklet containing what he called a chargesheet against CM Arvind Kejriwal. 
 
 Maken said Congress workers would go on a door-to-door campaign, distributing these booklets and explain the failures of BJP and AAP to the people. Congress will hold district conventions from February 4 to February 16. Party vice-president Rahul Gandhi will address a rally at Ramlila Maidan on February 22, in which the booth-level workers will have an interaction with the top leadership. A meeting of pradhans from unauthorised colonies will be held on February 26. Top functionaries who attended the convention were AICC in-charge of Delhi P C Chacko, ex-MPs Sajjan Kumar, Mahabal Mishra and Ramesh Kumar; former DPCC presidents Prem Singh, Subhash Chopra, Arvinder Singh Lovely; among others.
