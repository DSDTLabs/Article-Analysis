AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to the concerned state authorities over a PIL objecting to distribution of identity cards bearing the national emblem among primary teachers in   block of Ahmedabad district. 

 A local social worker,  , filed the PIL seeking directions to officials of the education department and police department, to ensure no further misuse of the national emblem. The petitioner also wanted the withdrawal of cards containing the sign and seal of the national emblem from employees not under Schedule I of the State Emblem of India (Regulation of Use) Rules, 2007. He demanded so because primary teachers do not fall under this category but they are being issued identity cards bearing the national emblem.
 
 The petitioner claimed that the Dholka taluka primary education officer issued fake identity cards with the seal of the national emblem. The cards have been issued to select teachers, who are members of the Primary Teachers' Union, because of their association with the ruling party.
 
 The petitioner sought directions to education department officials and the director general of police, to act quickly to prevent such cards being issued to primary teachers.
