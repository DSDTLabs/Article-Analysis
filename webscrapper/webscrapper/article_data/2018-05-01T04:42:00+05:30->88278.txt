Gandhinagar: The Gujarat government has announced a new scheme of waiver of 50% of the principal and interest of outstanding dues of electricity bill defaulters whose power connections have been disconnected.

 Saurabh Patel, energy minister, while announcing the scheme said, “The government has decided to provide re-connection to the defaulters, if they agree to pay 50% of the dues. They will also get interest waiver if they pay within three months. We hope it will benefit domestic and agricultural consumers who want their power connections back.”
