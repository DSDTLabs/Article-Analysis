Model and actress   is pregnant with her first child. The good news comes just months after the 'Queen' star tied the knot with her businessman beau Dino Lalvani in an intimate low-key ceremony last October. Lisa took to Instagram to post a picture of herself posing in a bikini, while caressing her baby bump. She shared the picture with a caption that read, 'Humble beginnings.'

 It wasn't long before wishes poured in from friends, fans and followers, congratulating the yummy mommy-to-be on the happy news. Congratulations to the couple!
