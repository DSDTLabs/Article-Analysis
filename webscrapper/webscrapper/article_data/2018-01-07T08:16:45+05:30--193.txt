MOHALI: The stone pitching in the   has become a major hindrance in removal of the wild growth from the choe. The wild plants have grown through the pitched stones disabling Greater   Area Development Authority ( ) workers to remove the growth.

 The councillors of the affected area put forth the problem of the wild growth through pitched stones in the N-choe before the mayor during the municipal corporation (MC) house meet held recently. The councillors added that as per a recent study, the wild growth in the N-Choe turned out to be a major cause of water logging during rainfall this year, which flooded the streets with water level touching 5 feet.   and Gmada have been holding series of meetings to work on the   prone points.
 
 N-Choe has over 10 feet of wild growth, which not only acts as check dams for natural flow of water but has also become hide out for miscreants and deadly reptiles, say residents of Phase IX. Heavy downpour had wreaked havoc in the low lying areas last season. Water entered into several houses, and spots in markets and roads turned into chronic stagnation points.
 
 Councillor of ward number 24 Kamaljit   said, “The N-Choe bisects Phase IX and the residents are forced to live under fear of criminals as well as health hazards.   was supposed to clean and clear the area and also construct cycle tracks, walking paths and fix foot lights on the banks of the choe but has miserably failed in doing so.”
 
 Councillor of ward number 35 Parwinder Singh said, “We had written to MC many times but no action has been taken yet. Earlier the work was with Gmada and we wished that it must be handed over to MC. But, now even the MC has failed in doing anything.” MC commissioner   said, “We are preparing a plan to find out ways of repairing the natural gradient in city. We will soon find out a suitable plan to give relief to the residents.” MC has been asked to repair storm water system to give proper natural gradient, he added.
