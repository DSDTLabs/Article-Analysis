NEW DELHI: Alleging threats from “right-wing extremist” organisations,   leader   approached the   on Wednesday seeking police protection for himself as also for framing of guidelines to provide protection to citizens facing such threats from radical outfits.

 Advocate Sunil Fernandes, appearing for Khetan, urged a vacation bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Navin Sinha to grant an early hearing on his plea. The court posted it for June 5.
 
 Khetan, who is holding the post of vice-chairman of Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi with cabinet rank, said in the petition that he was getting multiple death threats from ‘Sanatan Sanstha’ and had brought it to the notice of the Centre and   but they refused to take any action. He said police were not lodging FIR on his complaint and urged the court to direct a CBI probe.
 
 Referring to the murder of Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and M M Kalburgi, Khetan contended that right wing extremist organisations had gained prominence across the country since 2014 but the law and order enforcement agencies had failed to take effective action and discharge their duties to safeguard liberty and free speech.
 
 “... there are   organisations active in the country today. Some of the prominent groups among them are Sanatan Sanstha, Abhinav Bharat, Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, Hindi Rakshak Samiti, Bajrang Dal, Durga Vahini, Sri Ram Sene and Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Such radical right-wing extremist organisations have notably in the last couple of years carried out several murderous attacks on those who do not share their ideology and those who are rationalists, secularists, free thinkers, anti-superstition and critical thinkers,” he said.
 
 He said there is an urgent need to protect thinkers and intellectuals being threatened by such groups which were trying “to silence the voices of people by threats, intimidation, violence and even outright murder”.
