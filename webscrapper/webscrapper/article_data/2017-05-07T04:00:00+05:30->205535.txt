Palanpur: Sudden outbreak of diseases has sent health teams rushing to Vasada village of Banaskantha. 

 While some private laboratories where several blood samples were tested said it was a dengue outbreak, the district health authorities rubbished the claim saying that the method of analysis was not in conformation with the government norms.
 
 District malaria officer N R Gurg said that the three teams surveyed 234 hours and checked 985 people in the village in the last two days. “Only 10 cases of suspected malaria were found,” he said. 
 
 As many as 17 cases of fever and dysentery were reported from Vasada, most of them being children. The platelet count in five patients was below normal and their samples have been sent for tests in Palanpur Civil Hospital, said Gurg.
