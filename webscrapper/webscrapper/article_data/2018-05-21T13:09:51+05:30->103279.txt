KANPUR: Hitting out at the BJP government led by Yogi Adityanath, Samajwadi Party’s national president   during his visit to Mahoba on Sunday said, “BJP government, which came to power in the name of protecting animals has now even failed to save our kids from stray dogs in Sitapur.” The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that on Sunday even he was welcomed by stray animals during his visit to Mahoba, he added.

 
 Attacking the Yogi government over the law and order situation, the SP chief said that hooch tragedy in Kanpur Nagar and   districts, which have claimed many lives and left many other critically ill, only reflects the poor law and order in the state.
 
 Later, Akhilesh visited Dulgaon village in   and met the bereaved family members of the deceased.
 
 Earlier, he met family members of the couple of the deceased farmers, who had committed suicide following massive crop damage in recent hailstorm in   village of Mahoba district and gave the family members a cheque of Rs 25,000 each.
 
 Taking a dig at CM Yogi and his ministers who have been making night halt in Dalit houses, Akhilesh Yadav said, "Instead of making night halts, they should come forward and help the devastated farmers who are committing suicide following massive crop damage in the recent hailstorm".
