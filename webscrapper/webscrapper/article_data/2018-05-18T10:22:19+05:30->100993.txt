KOCHI: The issue waterlogging in the city could have been manageable, if there had been dedicated utility ducts. Though there were proposals for constructing drains with utility ducts on major roads as part of projects like the   and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut), they had to be scrapped.

 
 When the state government awarded the preparatory works for the Kochi Metro, like widening of MG Road and  , to the   ( ) in 2011, the project had envisaged construction of utility ducts as well.
 
 But, the DMRC didn’t construct dedicated utility duct citing lack of adequate land for the purpose. Later, the construction of dedicated utility duct on MG Road was envisaged as part of the Amrut project. “The DMRC constructed a wide drainage but left little space for a duct. Though we mooted a proposal to construct a duct utilising the drain, it had to be abandoned due to protest. Residents of areas where the drain passed through did not want to reduce the width of the drain,” an official associated with the Amrut project said.
 
 Most of the telecom operators are now migrating to 4G services. So, they are in a hurry to lay optical fibre cables across the length and breadth of the city.
 
 If a dedicated utility cable duct is constructed, the civic body can collect floor rent from the telecom service providers. The   is also laying underground cables for providing safe and uninterrupted power supply.
 
 Construction of a dedicated utility duct would be beneficial for the both corporation and the telecom operators. If there is a dedicated utility duct, the telecom operator will not have to dig up roads in the city. This will help them save the cost for road-digging and the amount to be spent on their restoration.
 
 Besides, the delay in digging up the roads and traffic snarls can also be avoided. “We will soon prepare a proposal for constructing a dedicated utility duct,” said P M Harris, chairman, standing committee for work, Kochi corporation.
