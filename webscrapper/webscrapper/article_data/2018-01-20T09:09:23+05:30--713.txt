CUTTACK: Residents living near the   in the city on Friday staged a sit-in in protest against the  's alleged failure to respond to their repeated demand that the local slaughterhouse be relocated.

 The agitators said in the past few years, hundreds of appeals have been made to the civic body to close down   - the local slaughterhouse - but the CMC has turned a deaf ear to their problems.
 
 In 2013, the Orissa high court had ordered the closure of the slaughterhouse. "Not just this, locals and government offices located in the area have also made several appeals to the CMC to relocate the house. But authorities have done nothing to help," said  , an agitator.
 
 Locals have alleged that a foul smell emanates from the slaughterhouse which pollutes the environment of the entire locality. Locals blame poor hygiene and sanitation as well.
 
 The back of the stadium where the slaughterhouse is located houses many government offices like the Directorate of Technical Education and Training, a private eye hospital, along with offices of cultural organizations like The Universe, government quarters and the OCA's cricket academy.
 
 "Its presence is an eyesore and has been seriously bothering us in the past two decades. It is high time the CMC takes note of our problems," said  , another agitator.
 
 CMC authorities have expressed their helplessness in the matter.
 
 "We had identified three to four land plots at Choudwar, Kantilo and Brajabiharipur for relocating the slaughterhouse but everywhere people have opposed it. We are trying to find a suitable place," said chairman of CMC's committee on health and sanitation, Ranjan Biswal.
