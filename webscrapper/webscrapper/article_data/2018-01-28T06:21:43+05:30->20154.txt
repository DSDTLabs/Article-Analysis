AMARAVATI:   N Chandrababu   on Saturday expressed displeasure over some BJP functionaries publicly criticising their tie-up with the ruling TDP in the state and said it was up to the other partner to decide whether to break the alliance or remain in it.

 “I am following the coalition dharma. I have also strictly instructed my party leaders not to openly criticise BJP despite the state facing problems on many fronts. Unfortunately, some BJP leaders have crossed the limits by openly criticising TDP and thus the alliance in the state,” Naidu said. 
 
 TDP sources said Naidu is unhappy with his sister-in-law and BJP member Purandeswari, who has been critical of various schemes of his government, including the Polavaram project.
 
 “BJP leaders are not criticising the alliance but are only finding fault with the state government for changing the names of the Central government’s welfare initiatives or diverting central funds. Whether to continue with the alliance or not will be decided by the top leadership of the two parties,” Purandeswari said.
