NAGPUR: Anita Bind, 53, now set for an angioplasty, had suffered a cardiac arrest after receiving the information of her younger son Akshay’s drowning at the wavepool at   amusement park on May 20.   and another reveller, Sagar Sahashrabudhe, had died. Snehal Motghare was miraculously saved in the incident. 

 On Friday, there was a candle march organized at Jaripatka seeking justice and solidarity for Sahashrabudhe and Bind. On Wednesday, a similar candle march was organized at Gandhi Putla square. 
 
 City police, which have registered a case of accidental death, is now against registering an offence of negligence citing nothing could be found against the aqua park management.   seems to be nowhere inclined to register an offence stating there is no fault of the management behind the deaths.   police too is in no mood to deliver the justice. As per a reliable source from Bajaj Nagar police station, the family members of the deceased are not keen to register an offence. 
 
 Trashing the polices’ claim, family members of Akshay said that they are still waiting for justice while fighting for reviving his ailing mother’s health. Victim’s elder sister Sonal said while she is helping mother to fight the trauma, her rest of the family are camping at police station for justice. “It’s a fake claim that we are not keen to register offence,” he said.
 
 Earlier this year, city police had registered offences against Empress mall management and it’s employees after three labourers had died in it’s premises while working. In the past, rural police had registered offence of negligence against owner of a farmhouse and it’s employees after a reveller had died in the swimming pool.
