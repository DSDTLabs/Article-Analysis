BHOPAL: Here’s good news for   The   (BMC) on Tuesday decided not resort to  . This decision was taken at a   regarding the   in the state capital.

 BMC commissioner Priyanka Das said, “As of now, the situation is comfortable. We are trying to find out a solution to water needs during the peak summer season. The outlook is to sustain and provide water till June”. She said that BMC is actively looking at ways to decrease the amount of water being drawn from the Upper Lake. The water body caters to nearly 40% of the state capital’s need. “Resorting to alternate day water supply is not an option that is being explored. Narmada water supply has eased the situation,” Das said. During earlier water crisis, BMC had resorted to alternate day water supply mechanism.
 
 BMC top boss has also directed officials to review water supply from the Upper Lake and possibility of substitution by Narmada water supply and Kolar pipeline. BMC estimates that there is over 300 km of water pipeline that overlaps with existing Upper Lake drinking water pipeline. “The idea is to substitute Upper Lake water with other sources like Narmada and Kolar. The water saved would then be supplied to areas which are completely dependent on Upper Lake water supply,” said Das.
 
 BMC officials admit that due to technical issues some of the areas in the city are receiving less than normal water supply. A number of colonies along Idgah Hills and surrounding areas are considered to be worst hit. In Kolar, water supply from the Rs 52-crore new water supply line is yet to reach all the colonies.
 
 In his budget speech, BMC mayor Alok Sharma had admitted that only three colonies in Kolar have been completely connected to the scheme.
