JAIPUR: To ensure safety of pedestrians, JMC has started an exercise to develop eight foot overbridges (FOBs) on Public Private Partnership (PPP) model.

 As city traffic comprises 57% two-wheelers, locations where frequent road mishaps involving motorists and pedestrians were observed, were identified.
 
 “We have invited expression of interest (EOI) for the construction of FOBs. This project will be constructed on revenue sharing model. Out of eight places, JMC has shortlisted six areas where these   will be constructed,” a JMC engineer said.
 
 The estimated cost to construct one FOB will be approximately Rs 2.5 crore. However, analysis of actual cost is yet to be done. “The work to design, plan and execute the project will be done by the appointed firm. FOB space will be provided to that firm for 15-20 years, where it can earn revenue from advertisements.”
 
 Areas including Gopalpura, M I Road, Tonk Road and Sikar Road where traffic is high and pedestrians face problems, have been earmarked for FOB construction.
 
 JMC has planned to equip FOBs with escalators and elevators to encourage pedestrians, especially the elderly, to use them. “Many existing FOBs in the city are defunct as they have no escalators and people avoid climbing stairs,” said a JMC engineer. 
 
 Meanwhile, to prevent accidents on   highway, especially in the densely populated regions, which pass through city areas,   (NHAI) has decided to construct FOBs at different locations of the route.
 
 On 225-km highway, NHAI has proposed to construct 23 FOBs in Rajasthan including some parts of   to reduce crashes and fatalities. The estimated cost to construct all FOBs is Rs 60 crore. NHAI has invited tenders for the fourth time as no bidder had showed interest to construct FOBs earlier.
 
 “FoBs are designed in a manner to allow two-wheelers along with pedestrians to cross the highway. Ramp will be constructed for two-wheeler riders,” said an NHAI official.
