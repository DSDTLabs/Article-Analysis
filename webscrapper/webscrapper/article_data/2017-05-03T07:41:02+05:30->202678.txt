AHMEDABAD: For many Amdavadis, their encounters with the   sting do not seem to end. Since January, there have been 985 malaria cases reported in government hospitals alone. In April alone, 478 malaria cases have been registered. Tagged with these are 89 falciparum cases since January. Malaria still is the most common disease affecting a large population.

 A recent study using   ( ) malaria data revealed that wards most vulnerable to malaria and falciparum infections contained approximately 10% of Ahmedabad’s population. But these wards had accounted for 37% and 40% of malaria and falciparum cases. Some of the most vulnerable wards like Sarkhej, Behrampur, Gomtipur, Khokra, Kankaria, Vatva and few other neighboring areas have 20% of the city’s population. But they accounted for 52% to 58% of malaria and falciparum cases.
 
 For over nine years now, the AMC has been pleading for a change in strategy to check the malaria menace. It says that apart from vector-control (mosquito control) activities, focus should also be on parasite control strategies to reduce malaria and falciparum infections. 
 
 An example is that of the island nation of Sri Lanka which has nearly eliminated malaria. 
 
 “Effective surveillance of malaria cases as well as reporting deaths caused by malaria or falciparum symptoms is essential for identifying which areas or population groups are most affected. This will also help in targeting our disease control resources towards such population clusters,” a senior AMC health official said. 
 
 Though the AMC has a program for surveillance, integrated vector management and a rigorous community engagement, there is hardly any effort to conduct research and increase social, technical and financial support for eradication.
