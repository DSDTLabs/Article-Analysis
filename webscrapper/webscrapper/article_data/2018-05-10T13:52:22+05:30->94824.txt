PANAJI: The Pune bench of the   ( ) is scheduled to reopen from July 7 as the tribunal’s acting chairperson has approved the arrangement of benches and allocation of business for work. 

 In an office order that’s likely to come as a huge relief for litigants and activists from Goa, the chairperson approved the appointment of Justice Sonam Phintso Wangdi as judicial member and   as expert member. The appointments appear to be temporary, as the order states that it shall be effective for two months from July 2. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This development comes in the wake of a writ petition filed before   by the NGT bar association (western zone). The Attorney General of India informed the top court that Justice   will discharge the duties of the chairperson, including the selection process, to fill up vacancies.
 
 The SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, held that Rahim’s appointment would strictly be an interim arrangement. 
 
 The functioning of the NGT’s principal bench in New Delhi, as well as the selection process, have been affected after Justice Swatanter Kumar’s retirement in December 2017. His successor, Justice U D Salvi, retired on February 13, 2018.
 
 The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) had, in a notification dated August 10, 2017, placed Goa under the principal NGT bench at Delhi. 
 
 In another notification in December 2017, the ministry had also allowed a single judge bench to dispose off cases. It is the constitutional validity of this notification that the NGT bar association challenged before the SC. 
 
 Justices Rahim and Salvi were both part of the Pune bench, and their transfers, as well as the stay on functioning of single judge benches by the SC, brought proceedings at   to a halt.
