HYDERABAD: The   (BEFI)   and Telangana units protested outside   (RBI) premises in the city on Friday. They requested the RBI to stop the merger of public sector banks. 

 "We have submitted memorandum to apex bank's officials, as we are deeply hurt by the speeches of RBI governor in meetings which were held abroad, along with him many officials have openly been supporting privatization and the merger of banks, this is a matter of great anguish for the bank employees" P Venkataramaiah, BEFI general secretary said.
 
 RBI top rung must understand that the financial health of the public sector banks is deteriorating because of bad debts which have accumulated over the past few years, the government must do something about it instead of talking about privatisation, he said. "We fear that the committee constituted by the Centre has recommended cutting down work force of the banks and large scale closure of branches, we oppose all these, as the actual problem is something else," another leader said.
 
 The union leaders after submitting the memorandum urged the local authorities to convert their anguish to the top brass.
 
 A protestor said that RBI should understand that the financial health of the public sector banks is deteriorating and the government must do something about it.
