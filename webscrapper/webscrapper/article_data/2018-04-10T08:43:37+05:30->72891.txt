AHMEDABAD: A metropolitan court has issued summons against Rs 11,300 crore Punjab National Bank ( ) fraud accused Mehul   and other directors of his Gitanjali Jewellers in connection with a cheque return case.

 The complaint against the firm, Choksi and other directors Chetan Zhaveri, Aniyath Nair and Dinesh Bhatia was lodged with the court by city-based firm Suranjana Enterprise after cheques worth Rs 48 lakh were not honoured. The cheques were issued on behalf of Gitanjali Jewellers after Suranjana demanded its money back following the franchise deal did not work out.
 
 Metropolitan Court No 27 is scheduled to hear the case further on Tuesday. The summons were issued earlier, but only two persons received them. Choksi has not received the summons, said complainant firmâ€™s advocate R P Pansari.
 
 Meanwhile, Zhaveri approached   high court through advocate Salil Thakore against the summons issued by the trial court and challenged the proceedings initiated by it. Justice J B Pardiwala temporarily stayed the court proceedings against Zhaveri and issued notice to the state government and Suranjana Enterprise. The HC made it clear that the proceedings against co-accused would continue.
 
 There is another proceeding that is underway before the HC involving Choksi. A Bhavnagar-based doctor Meeta Mankad had lodged a complaint of cheating against Choksi and   for cheating by floating a chit fund scheme. Choksi has filed a quashing plea, but the HC has refused to stay investigation against him. One of the accused, Digvijaysinh Jadeja too is opposing quashing of the FIR.
