MUMBAI: A father and son were arrested by the   police after a real estate agent alleged that they had forged his signature on his cheques and tried to withdraw money. The fraud was stopped just in time as his bank called him up before clearing the cheques. 

 Bhupendra   (50) has said that he shares his office on SV Road with the accused, who work as financial consultants. Earlier this year, Tripathi had found his cheque books missing. Some business-related documents and his wife’s PAN card and   card too could not be found, he has said. In his complaint, Tripathi has said that the accused had keys of a cupboard where Tripathi kept his cheque books and documents. 
 
 On June 23, Tripathi received a call from his bank regarding clearance of the cheques issued in the accused’s name. “There were four cheques amounting to Rs 8.5 lakh bearing Tripathi’s signature. Tripathi was alarmed as he hadn’t issued any such cheques. He forbade the bank from clearing the cheques and said that his signature was forged,” a police official said. 
 
 Once the payment was blocked, Tripathi lodged a police complaint. A case of theft and cheating was registered against the accused and they were arrested.
