PUNE:   such as Kondhwa, Hadapsar, Bibvewadi, Dhankawdi and Yerawada need to be extra cautious against   as the city’s mapping has found maximum   in these areas. 

 The health department of the   (PMC) has analysed data of the 163 swine flu   in the city between January 1 and April 2 this year. Of them, 84 patients were local residents and 79 had come to the city from adjoining areas for treatment.
 
 Among the 84 cases reported from the city, the maximum — barring a few from core pockets such as Kothrud — was from the fringe areas. 
 
 “The mapping of the city helps us identify the clusters where we can intensify our surveillance. We have already enhanced screening of patients with influenza-like symptoms not only on the fringes but across the city,” said ST Pardeshi, chief of the civic body’s health department.
 
 “We could identify patients at an early stage because of the mapping and treat them. Timely diagnosis and treatment are a must for early cure. During screening, people suspected to have contracted swine flu are being immediately administered oseltamivir, popularly known as Tamiflu or Fluvir, to prevent any complication. Besides, people with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension and pregnant women get vaccinated free of cost,” he said.
 
 Latest figures available with the PMC reveal that the virus has infected 172 people and claimed 28 lives in the city so far this year.
 
 Currently, the condition of 18 more swine flu infected patients is critical and they have been put on the ventilator at various hospitals in the city. Children below the age of 10 years and those in the productive age bracket of 31-50 years have been most affected by the virus. 
 
 “Children should be taught to maintain personal hygienic habits such as using handkerchief while sneezing or coughing, washing hands frequently and avoiding crowded places such as theatres or public gatherings,” paediatrician Jayant Navarange said.
