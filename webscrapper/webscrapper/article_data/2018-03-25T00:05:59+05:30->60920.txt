NAVI MUMBAI: The   (PWD) has undertaken temporary repair work on the   along the   highway to prevent fatal bike mishaps due to skidding over the wide gap in expansion joint, by filling the wide gap using asphalt. 

 But the bikers and motorists who use the highway are demanding that the PWD should install PVC-made bollards for the drivers to observe lane discipline.   resident, Vineet Mishra (39) said, “I drive to Panvel and when the car wheel goes over the gap in the expansion joint before climbing the Taloja flyover, the car wobbles and the driver loses control, which is indeed risky.” 
 
  PWD has installed bollards in a linear manner on the Jui creek bridge near Vashi flyover and similar steps should be taken on   creek bridge as well, added Mishra.
 
  A biker Mahesh Sawant said, “There are a few bollards installed along the expansion joint of the creek bridge but the distance between them is vast. They need to be installed at a distance of at least three metres along the entire stretch ” 
 
 PWD’s deputy engineer Pravin Naik said, “We had previously installed PVC bollards on Kalamboli creek bridge as well, but several were damaged after being hit by HMVs who do not follow lane discipline. However, we have ordered new bollards which will be installed on the bridge and other key spots on the Sion-Panvel highway.”
 
 He said, “Thane based firm appointed by the PWD as consultant has submitted a plan for a permanent solution of technical amendments to be made to the Jui creek bridge to resolve the problem of skidding at the expansion gap joints. We are inviting tenders from goverment recognized agencies for undertaking the repair work of Jui creek bridge.”
