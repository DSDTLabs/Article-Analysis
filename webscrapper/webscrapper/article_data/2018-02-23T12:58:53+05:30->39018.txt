GAYA: Four of the 66 exams centres created in Gaya for the Bihar School Examination Board’s Class X examination are all-woman centres with the centre superintendents, invigilators, static magistrates, patrolling magistrates, zonal magistrates, police officers, constables and others being women. 

 The all-woman centres are the  , Government Girls School, Urdu Girls School and the Ram Ruchi Balika Uchcha Vidyala, all in Gaya town. The examination commenced on Wednesday.
 
 According to education department sources, the move was experimental and similar arrangements would be made at the sub-divisional level in 2019 exams if the feedback is positive.
 
 Reena Kumari, Poonam Kumari, Mujahid Haq and Rajkumari have been made the centre superintendents at these centres, where only girls are taking the exam. Red carpets have also been laid between the school gate and exam halls. The centres have been decorated with balloons and festoons apparently with a view to helping the examiness de-stress themselves.
 
 Expressing happiness at the arrangements, Archana, who is taking the examination at the Zila School centre, said she felt more at ease. “With women invigilators and cops around, we can better concentrate on the exams as we do not fear stalking and indecent gaze,” she said.
 
 Kusum Kumari, former director of Women Studies department in  , said such initiatives, though symbolic, might make the girls feel good. “Girls otherwise have to live and survive in a world that is not specially tailored for them,” she said.
 
 Of the 83,000 examinees in the district, 43,000 are girls. That’s a positive sign more so because the sex ratio in Gaya district is heavily tilted against women, said Nasreen, a retired teacher.
