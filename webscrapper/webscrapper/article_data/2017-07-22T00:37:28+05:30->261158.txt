GUWAHATI: Hours after   chief minister   won the trust vote, the ruling Naga People's Front expelled 19 and suspended 10 of its MLAs on Friday evening for voting for the motion.

 The move gives rise to a new set of possibilities within the ruling party, including a vertical split, one that would suit   in its mission to take over the entire region. 
 
 The saffron party is supporting the Zeliang faction in the government.
 
 Zeliang secured 47 votes of which 36 were from the dissident NPF legislators backing him, four from BJP and seven Independents, while 10 NPF legislators owing allegiance to former chief minister and NPF president   and one Independent voted against the motion.
 
 The NPF had already expelled Zeliang for six years yesterday, making him the first man to be ousted by his own party for becoming the chief minister.
