NOIDA: Going full steam ahead on the ‘UP Ko Ye Saath Pasand Hai’ campaign launched by Uttar Pradesh chief minister   and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, workers of the two parties jointly addressed the media in   on Saturday. Stressing the electoral alliance for the forthcoming elections, party leaders sent out a strong message of unity to the electorate.

 GB Nagar SP president Pratap Singh Chauhan and Congress president Mahendra Nagar said that the   “was formed to stop communal forces from coming to power”.
 
 “With the support of the hand on the cycle, development in the state will take flight,” said Narendra Singh Yadav, former health minister with the Haryana government, who is also SP’s observer for the polls.
 
 Attacking the Modi government, Mahendra Nagar said Modi has not fulfilled his electoral promises made before the   elections. He also accused the BJP government of announcing a damp squib budget in order to hide the badly planned demonetisation move. “The BJP government has fooled the public, while the ruling party has propelled growth and development in the state,” he said.
 
 In Dadri, Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad also spoke to voters on Saturday. Asking the crowds to vote for the Congress-SP alliance, Azad accused Modi of being the biggest scamster. Terming demonetisation the biggest blunder of the PM, he rubbished reports of Hindu migration from Kairana. He also accused BJP of “vitiating the atmosphere” in Uttar Pradesh to “polarise votes” ahead of the elections.
 
 Addressing the large gathering, Azad also accused BJP of polarising UP with the Dadri lynching over beef. “We will win and come to power in UP with more than 300 seats,” he said.
