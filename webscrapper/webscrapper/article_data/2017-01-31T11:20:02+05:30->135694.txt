BHOPAL: After action by the mining department against overloaded trucks carrying sand from   river in his home district Sehore, chief minister   on Monday said that stringent action will be taken against   and transport activities, irrespective of any influence or affiliation.

 “I must appreciate that mining officers acted promptly and seized overloaded sand trucks in their area without succumbing to any influence. All district officers should ensure stern action against such illegal activities in their respective areas,” said Chouhan while addressing district collectors at a video conference in Mantralaya. The chief minister said that mafia should not thrive in the state and instructed the task force of mining department of each district to enforce laws to curb unlawful activities. “They should confiscate the vehicles involved in illegal mining, keeping in mind that it is a financial resource for the government and a source of employment for many. Also, the mining department should ensure that legal mining and transportation doesn’t get affected. Those who are engaged in mining operations with the government permission should not face problems,” he said. The chief minister also issued directions to provide safety to the mining staff and asked the police to launch campaign against goons in all districts.
 
 It was only a couple of days ago when the officials of Sehore mining department seized 10 truckloads of sand, suspecting overloading and registered cases against their owners. Four of the trucks seized by the officials were in the name of Pradumn Singh Chouhan, believed to be a close relative of the chief minister.
