'Welcome to New York' starring Diljit Dosanjh and   in leading roles along with an ensemble cast of actors has an ensemble cast of music directors as well. While only three songs of the film have been released, there is an interesting mix of singers who are a part of them. The starting song is the club number cheekily titled 'Pant Mein Gun' that starts out as a typical bhangra track and takes you by surprise with a wicked beat-drop. Alas, that is all there is to the track composed by Sajid-Wajid. Diljit tries to up the swag element but there is not much for him to do considering the repetitive nature of the song. After the frivolous track comes the meaningful 'Ishtehaar' written by Charanjeet Charan and composed by Shamir Tandon. This one has Rahat Fateh Ali Khan taking the mic along with the debutante Dhvani Bhanushali. Rahat is in full form, exhibiting his complete vocal range on this song. To anyone listening it is evident that Dhvani is trying hard to catch up with the maestro on this bleeding heart number, although she does display variations in the song. The third song, 'Nain Phisal Gaye' is penned by Kausar Munir and again composed by Sajid-Wajid and sung by Payal Dev. A dream sequence between Sonakshi Sinha and  , this one is a romantic yet mischievous number with several references to the Dabangg films. Fans of the Sonakshi-Salman Jodi will be able to glean all those references and watch the video on loop mode!
