Trichy: With only a few days left for the deadline to form Cauvery management board to expire, various political parties and outfits upped the ante by staging protests on Saturday. Makkal Adhikaram staged a protest with the participation of around 500 people. 

 The activists surrounded the head post office in Trichy to register their protest against the central government for its silence over the formation of the Cauvery management board. Initially, they gathered near the office of the All India Radio from where they took out a rally to the head post office. They sat in front of the post office and raised slogans against the Centre. 
 
 Folk singer Kovan sang songs calling for the formation of the board. Traffic movement was disrupted for more than two hours in the area due to the protest. The police arrested 1,098 people for unlawful assembly.Actor-turned-politician R Sarathkumar also joined the bandwagon by leading a motorcycle rally in Karur. It was part of his awareness rally for the retrieval of Cauvery rights, which was flagged off from Salem on Friday. The rally will end in Mayiladuthurai. 
 
 On hoisting the flag of his party Samathuva Makkal Katchi, Sarathkumar said that Tamil Nadu could not get its due share of Cauvery water due to the lack of pressure. Citing the reduction in funds to Tamil Nadu, he said, “ The central government is neglecting the demands of Tamil Nadu, giving an impression whether our state is in the country.”
