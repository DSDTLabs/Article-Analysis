AJMER: It was a coincidence that when   was returning from   at  , chief minister   also reached there. The traffic was blocked and Pilot was stuck in it. Pilot tried to meet Raje over blocking traffic but police requested him not to do so. 

 Bypolls in   are a direct fight between BJP and Congress. Both are trying hard to get the seat.
 
 Pilot on Saturday morning paid a visit to Masaniya Bhairav and offered prayers but priest and Champala Maharaj was not there. So he took a round of temple and went towards Beawar highway. 
 
 Here traffic was jammed because Raje was heading to Masaniya Dham. Pilot came out of his car and objected to the blockage by police. He tried to have a word with Raje on this issue but later left.
 
 There were workers of both parties on the spot and they avoided shouting or sloganeering.
 
 Masaniya Dham is a temple of deity Bhairav Nath and is revered by local communities.
