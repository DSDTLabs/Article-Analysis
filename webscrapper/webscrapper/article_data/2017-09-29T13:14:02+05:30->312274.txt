THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When government and aided schools in the state celebrate   on Monday , chief minister Pinarayi   would be heard urging students to keep vigil against rising intolerance and emulate the bravery of outspoken acti vists like Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, M M   and Gauri Lankesh who sacrificed their lives for the truth they stood for.
The chief minister's messa ge, to be read out to students on the day of Gandhi Jayanti, was sent to all schools on Wednesday from the office of Director of Public Instructions (DPI).
 
 “Forces against peace and brotherhood are at work around the world. War threat also bothers us. Gandhian thoughts are all the more relevant today when men hate each other in the name of colour and creed, and they belittle human valu es,“ the message reads.
 
 It also adds that no force could silence   during his stint in South Africa. In his home country too, he braved guns and lathis, and stood for what he preached. “Though the Mahatma fell victim to the bullets of a religious fanatic, Gandhian ideals continue to inspire the world,“ notes the message.
 
 “Those who speak the truth are getting killed. Dabholkar, Pansare, Kalbur gi and Gauri Lankesh were the last in the list. Let the bravery they showed in speaking out the truth be an inspiration for us. Let us also pay tributes to all others who sacrificed their lives for standing up for the truth. Children should try to know more about such people.Let us strive for an India where there is no discrimination in the name of caste and religion,“ it further says.
 
 Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier asked the state government support to observe the Gandhi Jayanti week as Swachta Hi Seva week, the latter did not heed to the same.
