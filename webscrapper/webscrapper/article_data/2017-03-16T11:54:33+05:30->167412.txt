NAGPUR: “The latest election results suggest that demonetization was a move in the interest of consumers, and people are realizing it of late,” said mayor Nanda Jichkar. She was speaking at an event held at Grahak Panchayat Karyalay, Ramdaspeth to celebrate   on Wednesday. The event was organized by Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Panchayat, Vidarbha.

 “We are going to deploy traffic controllers at cement road construction sites soon. This will ease the pain of commuters,” she said.
 
  (Women’s wing) Gouri Chandrayan said creating awareness about consumer rights was the best way to celebrate the day. She said, “We should shed our casual attitude and report even the slightest injustice. We should approach the collector or consumer court.”
 
 Highlighting the issue of adulteration, Chandrayan said, “We cannot escape this. Everything from milk to medicine is adulterated. The number of Agrmark labs have gone down from 72 to 11. It is disappointing that such institutes for protection of people are declining.”
 
 Jichkar also urged people to avoid tax evasion. “You must have faith in the government and believe that it is for your betterment,” she said.
 
 In the presidential address, Regional head Gajanand Pandey said, “The cost of production and margin of profit should be specified on labels of goods. The system of MRPs should be discontinued. In todays scenario, if you don’t bargain then you will face huge loss.”
 
 Senior activist  , regional secretory Sanjay Dharmadhikari, organizing secretory Gnahes Shirode, district head (Women’s wing) Tripti AKanti, regional head (women’s wing) Smita Deshpande were present during the event.
