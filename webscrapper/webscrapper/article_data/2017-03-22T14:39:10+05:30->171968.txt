NAGPUR: The civic administration has raked in Rs 3 crore in the first 6 days of its amnesty scheme for  , which was rolled out on March 16.

 The scheme, offering up to 90% and 75% concession to the defaulters on the penalty amount, is likely to benefit over 1.78 lakh property owners in the city. But the scheme is not evoking good response from the defaulters.
 
 Angry over the poor response, additional commissioner   on Tuesday convened a meeting of all 10 assistant municipal commissioners and stressed the need to improve recovery of   collection.
 
 “The scheme has not received the expected response and people, who were not making payments earlier due to the penalty amount, too are not coming forward to pay their dues. The scheme, which was launched to recover Rs 191 crore arrears from the defaulters, will not add to the civic body’s income it seems. It will also hit the revised budget of the civic chief too,” said a senior officer from the department.
 
 Those who clear the tax in the first phase (from March 16 to March 24) itself will get 90% concession, while those who clear them in the second phase (from March 25 and March 31) will get a concession of 75%.
 
 According the figures provided by the property tax department, if 100 % recovery is made, dues amounting to Rs191 crore can be recovered through the scheme. 
 
  has performed well as 836 defaulters have cleared their dues and the   has recovered Rs57.19 lakh from them. It was followed by   zone with 669 defaulters paying Rs 36.40 lakh.
