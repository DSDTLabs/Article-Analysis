NEW DELHI: It is a simple enough, if innovative idea —   the   that   to trap allergens and pollution. And it took the brilliance of a team from IIT Delhi to fabricate into what is likely the cheapest and most convenient pollution filter.  , as it is called, is stuck to the nostril, causes no discomfort, allows easy breathability, and stops a claimed 95% allergens and PM2.5 polluting particles from reaching the airway, saving people with breathing problems much pain.

  NasoFilter was showcased at IIT-D’s Industry Day event on Saturday, where over 200 firms were present to assess the commercial viability of the students’ inventions. These were designed for various purposes and fields, ranging from defence, environmental sustenance, affordable healthcare, smart cities and energy. They included air quality monitors, sensors to detect moisture levels in the soils and regulate watering, and a self-strapping riding helmet that cosily hugged the chin at a push of a button.
 
 Most of the exhibits were developed by students under the guidance of teachers with minimal funding and technical support, but with the objective of developing affordable items.
 
 Speaking to TOI, V Ramgopal Rao, director of  , rued that most people were mistakenly convinced that the research done at IIT was only on a theoretical scale. On Industry Day, it showed the companies that it could create products that were both practical and market driven. Many of them need widespread trials before industrial production. “For this to happen, we need industry’s support,” said Rao.
 
 Aditya Vikram, a security systems company executive, was happy with the products, but said “some hand-holding would be required” to make them production ready. “Many engineering institutions develop gadgets as part of their class projects but there is no use for these in industry. With an event like this, IIT will see more interaction with industry and both will benefit,” said Vikram.
