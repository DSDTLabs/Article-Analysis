Salem: An omnibus, which had been shuttling between Salem and Coimbatore twice daily for the past six months, with the registration number of a bike in Chennai was seized on Monday.

 During a vehicle check, a team of officials led by regional transport officer (RTO), Salem West, D Damodharan, stopped the omnibus, which was heading to Coimbatore with passengers, on Salem-Coimbatore national highway on Monday evening.
 
 While verifying the documents, the officials found the registration number was fake. “The omnibus had been operating with the registration number of a bike in Chennai, while it was originally registered with Andhra Pradsh. All other documents, including permit, fitness certificate insurance and road tax, were also forged,” the RTO said.
 
 Regional transport officials have registered a case and further investigation is on. The officials are trying to locate the owner of the omnibus. 
 
 “It is difficult to locate the owner as we do not have proper documents. We will question its driver and cleaner for lead,” the RTO said.
