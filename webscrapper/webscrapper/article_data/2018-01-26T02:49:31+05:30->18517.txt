NEW DELHI:   suspected to having been   and forced to work as household helps were rescued from a businessman’s house in northwest Delhi on Wednesday. The children, aged nine and seven, were brought to the city from Jharkhand through an illegal placement agency. A case has been filed under the   and Bonded   police station and the businessman’s son has been arrested.

 A neighbour called the women’s helpline 181 about two minor girls being locked up in a house in Pitampura. When a joint team of police and the helpline reached there to conduct an inquiry, the businessman’s son feigned ignorance and claimed that the girls might have sneaked into the house.
 
 The children were kept locked in a dark room without food. They were threatened to be harmed if they raised an alarm or told anyone about their presence.
 
 The businessman’s son was taken to the police station along with the two children. While being counselled, the girls told the cops that their parents are very poor and stay in a village in Jharkhand. They were brought to Delhi by a woman who sold them to a trafficker three months ago. They were tortured by the employers if they failed to perform their duties efficiently.
 
 The employer, however, claimed that some money was paid to the mother of the girls through the woman who had sent them. Police have not been able to verify this claim.
 
 The girls have been sent to a government-run shelter. They will be produced before the child welfare committee and a magistrate to give their statement and handed over to their families once police are able to locate them.
