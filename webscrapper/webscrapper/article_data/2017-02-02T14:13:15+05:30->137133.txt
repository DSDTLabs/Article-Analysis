Not only traffic police, even college peons and security guards blow whistle every now and then in  . If you are sitting in campus having a good time with your friends and you hear someone blowing a whistle behind your back, it’s your cue to leave the premises at once. Reason? There is   for city college students once their lectures are over. “There is no written rule that we can’t loiter around in   once the lectures are over, but most of the time collegians are thrown out immediately once the classes are finished,” says Mandar Shewale, a commerce student.

  The authorities maintain the stance that there is no need for students to loiter around in campus once the lectures are over. The security guards don’t even let students wait up in college parking. “You would think that you might breathe easily once you are out of the campus and standing on road, but no! Once you are out, the police will immediately shoo you from College Road. It’s like we collegians are outcast, we are not even supposed to exist in public places,” adds Harshali Pardeshi, an arts student.
 
  
 
 
  Various college administrations emphasis that restrictions on loitering around are meant for the betterment of students only. “There have been instances in the past when girl students were troubled or fights broke into two students groups. Such incidences do no good to anyone. Academic engagements are over by afternoon therefore, students have no reason to loiter around. They can if they are busy with study or some other activities, but then there are college professors to supervise such activities. When the lectures are over and college atmosphere is a little laid back, outsiders try to enter the campus and cause trouble. In the wake of increasing criminal activities among students, such restrictions are necessary,” opines a senior college professor.
