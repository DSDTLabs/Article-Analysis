MUMBAI: For Man-of-the-Match  ,   was a special season capped by a special knock in the final. “It’s just been a special season. To get an opportunity after my previous year was incredible. Things fell my way nicely tonight, but to be able to do it in such a big game... it’s very special. After those first ten balls, I was hoping to catch up and just wanted to get run-a-ball before getting out.”

 
 
 
 Talking about the conditions, the Australian said: “Bhuvneshwar was excellent so we had to see the first six overs without any damage. Once the ball stopped swinging, it got easier.” Watson expressed happiness that he would get some rest after a gruelling season. “The good thing is I don’t have to play for a few months, so I have some time to recover.”
 
 
 
 Senior player Harbhajan Singh, who had to make way for legspinner Karn Sharma in the final, called the chase a ‘brilliant’. “The way we’ve chased these runs, it was absolutely brilliant. And you see what Watson brings to the table. When set batsmen are in, anything is possible.” 
 
 About Karn being preferred to him, Harbhajan said: “Kane Williamson was in good form, so we needed a bowler who took the ball away, therefore we preferred Karn tonight.”
 
 Ambati Rayudu, who finished as highest run-getter for   this season with 602 runs, said: “I’m really fortunate to have such a great season. I’ve worked really hard, and was happy to score the winning runs. Initially, the wicket was slow, but I thought it was damp. It got much better, so I was confident we’ll chase it.”
 
 Delhi Daredevils’ Rishabh Pant, who got the Emerging Player of the Year award, said: “I enjoyed the whole tournament but it didn’t go well for the team though. When you play a lot, you get the confidence. That’s all I’m trying to do. This year, I have changed my style; have tried to control my instincts.”
