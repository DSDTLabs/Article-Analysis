 Lokesh’s father Rajiv Srivastav, who runs a medical clinic in Etah, said: “Lokesh was planning to go to Nainital with his friends for the New Year celebrations. We had asked him to cancel the plan, given the dense fog and the chilly weather condition, and he had agreed to our suggestion.

 “Between January 1 and 4, we visited several police stations of Ghaziabad, but it was only on Thursday evening we were able to confirm his identity at Masuri police station. Police had cremated him after 72 hours, so we could not get his body,” Srivastav added.
