Jodhpur: Arguments on appeal against five-year sentence to   Khan in a blackbuck poaching case will begin from July 17. The court adjourned the hearing after marking the presence of Salman Khan in the court on Monday after the defence counsel prayed for the adjournment.

 District and sessions judge Chandra Kumar Songara, however, asked both the sides to begin the hearing on the appeal but defence counsel Mahesh Bora, citing the workload in the courts on account of morning hours, prayed for the adjournment till July.
 
 “We protested the appeal by Salman in the case and expressed our wish to begin the hearing today itself. But the defence sought time in view of the court timings”, said the prosecution counsel Mahipal Bishnoi.
 
 Salman had appeared in the District and Session court on Monday in compliance of the directions of the court to appear on Monday given on April 7 while suspending the sentence and granting him bail.
 
 “Salman appeared in the court in compliance of the courts direction. The court marked his attendance and adjourned the matter for hearing on July 17”, said Bora adding that it may not be necessary for Salman to appear in the court during the hearing. 
 
 It may be recalled that one more appeal in a case against Salman under Arms Act is already pending in the same court. The state had moved the session court challenging the acquittal of Salman in this case by the trial court.
 
 Bishnoi said that the defence expressed its wish to argue in both these cases together but the court refused to grant their wish stating that both are separate matters. Hearing in this appeal is listed for May 15. 
 
 On Monday at about 8.30 am, Salman reached the court where he remained for barely 5-6 minutes and left after marking his attendance.
