Ahmedabad: The   ( ) on Friday approached   against the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, restraining it from buying new diesel buses.

  Last month, the   passed an ex-parte interim order on an application filed by one Mushtaq Qadri, by which it asked Gujarat government, especially the AMTS, from buying buses till the dispute over the fuel was resolved. When AMTC floated tenders for the purchase of diesel buses, Qadri first moved the NGT in Pune and then Delhi against the decision, seeking directions that the state government and its arms buy CNG-powered vehicles.In its petition, the AMTS questioned the NGT, New Delhi’s territorial jurisdiction in passing a restraining order without hearing the state government. Seeking the quashing of the NGT’s interim order, AMTS contended that the relief granted is in the form of final relief. The HC is likely to hear this petition on Monday, sources said.
 
 Earlier, in another litigation before the high court, the state government defended the use of diesel fuel for vehicles by submitting that the Euro IV norms for use of diesel make it a more viable option than CNG.
 
 Interestingly, the state government and NGOs fought a long legal battle to make CNG use compulsory for vehicles plying in Gujarat. For this, the government successfully contested a case to bring gas prices in Gujarat to par with those in Delhi and Mumbai.
