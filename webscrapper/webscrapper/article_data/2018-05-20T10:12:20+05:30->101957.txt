INDORE: There is a need to bring together all environmentalists working in isolation on one platform to conserve nature, said   director  , while appreciating Indore’s society, where people can unite for a cause.

 He was speaking on the last day of three-day film festival on water resource management held at Govindram Sekasaria Institute of Management and Research. 
 
 Srivastava also focused on giving importance to soil preservation, at the same level as water conservation. He stated that   region was fast losing soil due to erosion and the soil was turning into murrum losing out entirely on its organic content because of heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 
 
 “The concept of ‘Jaivik Setu’ in Indore is quite appreciable but there is a need to launch it at a wide scale and urge farmers along the   basin at Mandleshwar to do organic farming and sell their produce through a chain of outlets of Jaivik Setu,” Srivastava added. 
 
 He also urged each attendee to become volunteers and fight for the betterment and conservation of nature. 
 
 A three-month basic ornithology course for bird experts will start at the GSIMR and a student chapter, which would host events, will be opened, announced the organising body, The Nature Volunteers.
 
 Social activist   was felicitated on the occasion with ‘Paryavaran Prahari’ award and a cash prize. However, he refused to take the shield and the cash prize and only accepted the title of Paryavaran Prahari, which means a guardian of nature.
