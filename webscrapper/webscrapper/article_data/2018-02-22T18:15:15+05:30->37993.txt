NEW DELHI: In a good news for para powerlifter  , the   (CGF) has accepted her entry under “exceptional circumstances” for the Gold Coast   from April 4 to 15. Sakina, whose entry for the CWG wasn’t originally sent by the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI), will compete in the lightweight category (up to 61g). TOI was the first to publish about Sakina’s case in its edition dated January 10, 2018.

 
 
 
 “The CGF has concluded that Ms. Sakina Khatun shall be awarded a conditional slot in the women’s lightweight para powerlifting event at the 2018 CWG. This slot is being awarded in exceptional circumstances, on the basis the athlete should not be disadvantaged through an administrative error on the part of her Commonwealth Games Association (read IOA) and being no fault of her own. CGA India is required to confirm acceptance of the conditional slot by no later than 21st February 2018,” wrote CGF CEO   in a letter to IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta.
 
 However, the CGF has put a condition. Grevemberg has asked the IOA and the PCI to submit a health certificate from a registered medical practitioner confirming Sakina’s stable mental well-being. The move followed Sakina’s threat to commit suicide if not named in India’s contingent for the CWG. “The CGF reserves the right to withdraw the slot if CGA India fails to submit this confirmation,” Grevemberg added.
