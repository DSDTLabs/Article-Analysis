PATIALA:   government has decided to shut down the Khadi and   ( ) under which it had facilitated setting up over 50,000 production units in the state over the last several decades. The entire staff of the board from all 22 districts has been asked to report in Chandigarh as the government contemplates shifting them to state industries department. There are 32 staff members, including clerks and peons, who are working for the board.

 Around 80 posts in the board had been lying vacant. Punjab is the first state to shut down khadi board constituted under the Parliament Act 1955. The state used to receive a grant of Rs 10-12 crore every year from the Union government to provide 25% subsidy on loans to set up small scale units in rural areas. The maximum limit of subsidy was Rs 25 lakh under this scheme.
 
 Pardeep Dewan, general secretary of the  , said that, “On one hand the government is promising employment and on the other hand it has hit the small scale industry. Over 2 lakh people are directly employed in around 50,000 small scale factories in Punjab that had been set up over the years with the subsidies provided by the board.” He said that the move would discourage new small scale units in Punjab. “The small scale industry needs to be promoted but the government decision is against the growth of such enterprises,” Dewan maintained.
 
 The decision to shut down the board could also cut down state revenues as Punjab might lose additional taxes generated by the small industrial units. Dewan claimed that the units that were set up with subsidy given by the board were contributing over Rs 40 crore to state exchequer in various taxes. Besides, the overall industrial production would also be hit because of the move as the board used to have a target to assist starting of 500 small scale units in Punjab, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, efforts to contact principal secretary (industries) D P Reddy remained futile as he did not respond to several phone calls and messages.
