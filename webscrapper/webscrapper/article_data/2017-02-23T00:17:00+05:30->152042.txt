Bhopal: The ruling BJP has dubbed the Congress agitation against the state government as a “sponsored show to cover up factionalism within the party” while stating that the opposition party will not be able to influence public with its move.

 “Congress is a divided house, as it could not raise any issue before the public in the last 12 years. Now, to cover up the prevailing groupism in the party they have organised a show of strength to appease its leadership in the name of alleged irregularities,” said a BJP spokesperson here on Tuesday. He said Congress leaders were also trying to pressurise the state administration and threatened to take law into their hands, which shows how much faith do they have in democracy. The public has chosen the Congress to play the role of a responsible opposition, raise issues in public interest and lodge their dissent in a democratic manner. “But, it seems that the Congress leaders have ignored all democratic norms to appease their masters. Factionalism in the party has provoked its workers to take law into their hands, which has resulted into indiscipline,” he said.
 
 The Congress has announced to lay a siege to the state assembly on Wednesday over the issues like illegal sand mining, multi-crore hawala scam in Katni, ISI spy ring, Supreme Court ruling on Vyapam scam and atrocities on Dalits and tribals. The Congress leaders have also alleged that the BJP government in MP has failed to curb corruption. The Congress said the agitation would be followed by the party’s demand for discussion on controversial issues in the state assembly. The Congress has also demanded resignation of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for his alleged failure in containing illegal mining in the state. However, the BJP has ruled out any irregularity in the state saying, “The state government has taken all necessary steps and there is no illegal mining as alleged.”
