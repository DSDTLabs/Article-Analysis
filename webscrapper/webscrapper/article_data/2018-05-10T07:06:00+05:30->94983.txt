LUDHIANA: In order to solve the problem of   from residential areas and to end the monopoly of private garbage collectors, civic officials are planning to introduce door-to-door garbage lifting in two more wards of the city through A2Z waste management company. Already, the door-to-door garbage lifting is going on in Ward 67 of the city successfully. However, the new wards are yet to be finalized, and mayor Balkar Sandhu claimed he would first consult the councillors, and then wards will be selected for the project.

 
 More than seven years have passed since door-to-door garbage lifting was implemented in Ludhiana, and A2Z waste management company was hired by MC for this task, but so far, the company could not cover the entire city. The door-to-door garbage lifting — which was initially launched in August 2011 in Ward 49 (now Ward 67) — was once again started from the same ward (67) on 5 June 2017. A2Z staff claimed they had covered the ward completely in almost one month with the support of councillor Mamta Ashu and cabinet minister  . The company was collecting garbage from 2,800 households at Rs 50 per house.
 
  resident   said private garbage collectors work as per their whims and fancies and charge different rates from different people. He said other councillors should also support the move for public benefit.   resident   said there was dire need to curb the monopoly of private garbage collectors, as earlier too, the company attempted to start garbage collection in many areas, but due to resentment and protest staged by private garbage collectors, the move was withdrawn. He demanded it should be implemented at any cost in the rest of the city as well.
 
 Mayor Balkar Sandhu said other councillors would also be taken into confidence for starting door-to-door garbage lifting from their respective wards. He said he would conduct a meeting with A2Z and councillors on the issue.
