 The band members manage their passion with their occupations. Since most of the members are employed or still studying, they practice over the weekends. If they have an upcoming event then they practice every evening, no matter how tedious it may seem.
 
 The repertoire of most bands includes Hindi, Marathi and English   and their most popular requests are the old Bollywood numbers. 
 
 “We play at a number of functions from senior community groups to birthday parties to weddings,” said Rohan Patil, who founded   in Airoli seven years ago.
 
 He added that the band members are aged between 15 and 25 years. “I try to restrict myself to youngsters since their talent needs exposure,” he said.
 
 The number of members in a band may vary depending on the occasion but generally every band has 10 or more members. “Smaller events don't need a large band but bigger events do,” he added.
 
 Reena Nair and her husband, who manage the 10-member Sur Sangam Music Circle orchestra in Nerul, agree with Patil’s views. “The number varies depending on the event we are playing for,” she explained, adding that since they don’t restrict themselves to wedding seasons, they have a variety of events to play for.
 
 Another band owner Hemant Kumar said his band varies from 15 to 100 musicians, depending on the event.
