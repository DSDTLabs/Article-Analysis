NASHIK: The city range police is all geared up to bring down the rate of fatal accidents with a   drive, which will soon be launched across Nashik Rural, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar and Dhule districts.

 Inspector General, Special, V K Chaube said, “We had organised a similar drive in the past for a month and managed to bring down the number of fatal accidents by nearly 60 than the previous month.” 
 
 A team has been designated by each of the police stations to keep a check on the range of illegal practices. On a daily basis, the team will be required to report about the action taken by them to the district office, which will then be reported to the IG office. 
 
 The teams will take action against overspeeding, driving on the wrong side, drunk driving, not installing tail lamps, consumption of liquor at dhabas, overloaded vehicles, etc. 
 
 Personnel who do extraordinary work during the drive will be felicitated at the end of the campaign. “Conducting such drives at regular intervals help in spreading awareness among motorists about the importance of adhering to traffic norms,” said Chaube.
 
 In June, last year, the police had taken up a similar drive across the range wherein 195 fatal accidents were reported in the jurisdiction. A month earlier, when there was no drive, a whopping 264 fatal accidents were reported, which was a drop of 69 fatal accidents.
 
 Apart from the   highway and the   highway, there are other state highways through the jurisdiction where a large number of accidents are reported on a regular basis.
 
 “Our attempt is to bring down fatal accidents as bikers are often found speeding, given the wide roads and improvement in vehicles,” Chaube said.
