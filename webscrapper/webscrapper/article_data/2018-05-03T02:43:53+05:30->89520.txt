NEW DELHI: An assistant sub-inspector of the Delhi traffic police was hit by a Toyota Camry being driven by a  , who was drunk at the time of the incident, in south Delhi’s Panchsheel early Wednesday. The policeman sustained multiple fractures. 

 The   student, Harsh Vardhan, was arrested on the spot. There were three other friends—one of them later identified as Shobhit—with him in the car. Vardhan and Shobhit were found to be drunk. 
 
 The ASI, along with other police staff, was on duty when the car hit him. “Around 2am,   Harender, along with other police staff, was on picket duty near Panchsheel Park. A Toyota Camry being driven by Vardhan was asked to stop as they wanted to do an alcohol test on the driver. However, Vardhan first hit Harender and then rammed into the barricade. Harender suffered fractures on the leg and the hand,” Romil Baaniya, deputy commissioner of police (south), said. 
 
 Some policemen rushed to Harender’s rescue, while others pulled out Vardhan from his car. He was almost dropping off at the wheels, police said, adding that many passersby stopped to help the policemen and one of them made a PCR call. The ASI was rushed to the AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he is still seeking treatment. 
 
 Police said a case under Section 279 (punishment for rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of IPC and 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act has been registered against Vardhan.
