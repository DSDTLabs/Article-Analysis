Former Prime Minister  's party JD(S), which has been the third player till now in the Karnataka assembly elections, could well emerge as the kingmaker after the results are out today.

 If exit polls are to be believed, JD(S) with around 40 seats could hold the key to the next government in Karnataka.
 
 If that happens, it will give a big boost to the move by regional parties to reassert their importance in the national politics and occupy the void created by a declining Congress.
 
 
 
 
 For the JD(S), which forged a pre-poll alliance with Mayawati's BSP, the real game may begin only once the results are out.
 
 The Congress has already dropped hints that it will go all out to woo the regional party, in case of a hung assembly.
 
 
 
 
 Chief minister Siddaramaiah, who could be the biggest stumbling block in this alliance, has already dropped hints that he will step aside for a dalit CM if the party so decides.
 
 The BJP would also go all out to forge an alliance with the JD(S) in case of a hung assembly, so that it can ensure a non-Congress government in the state.
