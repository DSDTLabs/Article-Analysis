 Bhubaneswar mayor A N   said Bhubaneswar gets less ranking due to lack of a solid waste treatment plant in the city. “We have been trying to set up a solid waste treatment plant for the city during last five years, but it can’t take off due to protest of local people. But we will try to solve the issue to get good ranking in the national survey,” he added.
