DHARWAD: Samaj Parivarthan Samudaya and Jan Sangram Parishat, which have launched an agitation against land grab and   in the state, have welcomed the people’s mandate in the recently concluded assembly election.

 On Monday   chief   said, “It is a victory of the people who have shown doors to 13 arrogant and tainted cabinet ministers by defeating them in the polls. This defeat should be a warning to other politicians who indulge in illegal practices and loot natural resources of the state.”
 
 Lashing out at the previous   government led by Siddaramaiah,   said the then chief minister was asked several times to collect the pending mining royalty from some firms. However,   who had come to power assuring that he would put an end to illegal mining and collect the royalty, never bothered to keep up his promises, Hiremath charged. 
 
 As a result of this, people have taught a bitter lesson to the Congress, he said.
 
 The yet-to-be-formed coalition government headed by H D Kumarswamy should make serious attempts to collect Rs 1 lakh crore in mining royalty, Hiremath urged. This apart, the erring mining owners should be booked and stern legal action should be initiated against them, he said.
 
 Governor’s action flayed
 
 Hiremath said governor Vajubhia Vala erred by inviting   to form the government and giving him 15 days to prove the majority. The activist also welcomed the intervention by the Supreme Court in ensuring that there was no scope for horse trading.
