NAGPUR: In an attempt to highlight the inspiration drawn from western  , Nishad in association with Janhvi Enterprises organized a unique   at Scientific Hall,  , on Sunday. The event named ‘Composers’ Tune’ was conceptualized by   and Anoop Huddar.

 The original western music tracks from which veteran music directors drew inspiration were played before the improvised Bollywood version for the audience to draw parallel between the two. Hit compositions of veteran music directors like OP Nayyar, SD   and his son RD Burman were showcased by solo as well as duet performances by the singers. The event talked about how composers looked as far as Egypt and Europe for inspiration for their tunes.
 
 The concert took off in high spirits on the notes of ‘Ek Haseena Thi’ which was originally a George Bensons’ creation adapted by Laxmikant Pyarelal. The song ‘Kaun hai jo sapno mein aya’ was inspired by Elvis Presley’s ‘Marguerite’ and a Polish folk song ‘Szła Dzieweczka’ inspired Salil Chaudhary to compose the song ‘Dil tadap tadap ke’ for the movie ‘Madhumati’. Not just Bollywood songs, the event also staged inspired music from Marathi cinema and one such track was ‘Papa sangh kunache’ inspired from Welsh artist Donald Peers’s ‘Papa loves mumma’.
 
 The audience was left mesmerized by the nostalgic tunes and witty camaraderie between Shweta Shelgaonkar and Kshitij Kulkarni. While talking about the concept, Kulkarni said, “In the era of no Internet or global connectivity, western music still served as a muse for our directors and they managed to create such gem of songs. This cultural exchange led to the introduction of jazz music and orchestration in Bollywood.” Various singers from the city lend their voices to make the event a phenomenal success.
