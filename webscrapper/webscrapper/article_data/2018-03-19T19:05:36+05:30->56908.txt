The   of the   has called for a strike of drivers of cab aggregators   starting Sunday midnight in Mumbai.

 Uber had given big assurances to the drivers, but today they are unable to cover their costs. They have invested Rs 5-7 lakh and were expecting to make Rs 1.5 lakh a month. But drivers are unable to make even half of this because of the mismanagement by these companies," Sanjay Naik of Maharashtra Navnirman Vahatuk Sena said.
 
  
  
 
 In Mumbai alone there are over 45,000 such cabs but a slump in business has seen a drop of about 20 per cent in their numbers.
 
 The cab hailing companies have so far stayed away from interfering in the matter.
 
 Police has issued notices to leaders of the union under section 149 of CrPC relating to unlawful assembly in Mumbai.
  
  Drivers in other cities like New Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune among others are also participating in the strike.
