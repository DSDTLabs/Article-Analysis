 The axe finally fell on   as   on Tuesday removed him from the post of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president with immediate effect. With his removal, all the   committees stand dissolved.
 
  BPCC vice-president   has been made working president till the new state party president is named, sources said. Quadri is close to former Union minister Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who recently emerged as one of the frontrunners for the state Congress chief’s post. Quadri thanked the party’s central leadership for giving him the new responsibility.
  
  Choudhary, a few days back, had accused a few senior Congress leaders of fuelling rebellion against him through false propaganda that he was attempting a split in the state legislature party. Congress has 27 MLAs in the 243-member Bihar assembly. It is widely believed in the Congress circles that a majority of the party MLAs have been trying to cross over to the ruling JD(U) led by CM Nitish Kumar.
  
  “There must be some reasons behind Choudhary’s removal,” AICC general secretary and party in-charge of Bihar affairs C P Joshi said on Tuesday. He also said Elections of district Congress committees and for AICC and BPCC delegates have to be completed by October 16.
  
  Choudhary, who is considered close to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, was appointed party’s state chief on March 31, 2013, almost two-and-a-half years after his predecessor Mehboob Ali Qaiser resigned from the post following the major electoral setback in the 2010 state assembly election in which Congress had won just four seats compared to nine in 2005.
