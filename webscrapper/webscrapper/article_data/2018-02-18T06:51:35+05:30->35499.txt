LUCKNOW: In a major move to ensure ease of business in UP, the government plans to replace the single window clearance system for industries with a digitized system. The upgradation will be formally announced by Prime Minister   on the opening day of the UP Investors’ Summit on February 21.

 Sources said that the new system would ensure that any person or company wanting to set up an industry in the state would no longer have to go to any official in person.
 
 
 Unlike the single window clearance system, where investors had to go to at least one state official, even if all the work happened through a single channel, the new system would ensure that the entire process for application of clearances etc., would be made online, bringing absolute transparency in the process and preventing corruption.
 
 It will be monitored by the   and every movement of e-files will be watched closely. Officers will be held accountable for any delay in moving these.
 
 Currently, the Udyog   has been the government’s single window clearance system, operational since 1999. Officials say that it provides complete services for the purpose of setting up of business in the state and covers all industrial approvals.
 
 In 2009, the single window clearance system was made online. It was named   and was ranked as one of the best in India by the erstwhile   in its March 2014 report.
 
 “The portal has a monitoring dashboard with colour coding through which officials can monitor progress of pending applications. The system also updates investors about the progress of their application through SMS.
 
 The common application form for approvals and clearances for starting a business in the state, known as Common Application Form (CAF), is also available on the Nivesh Mitra website. The   considerably reduces the time and hassles faced by investors in filling multiple applications by eliminating the need of filling up repetitive information in the forms,” said an official.
