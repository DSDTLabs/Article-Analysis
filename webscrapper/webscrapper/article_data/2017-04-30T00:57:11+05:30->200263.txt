MUMBAI:   Prasanna Chamankar has approached chief minister   to demand a high level probe against the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) for registering a criminal case against him on the basis of fabricated documents in the  .

 The ACB had on June 11, 2015 filed a criminal case against Chamankar and his family membersNCP leader Chhagan  , his nephew Sameer, legislator son Pankaj and high ranking public works department officials for their alleged involvement in the Maharashtra Sadan  , which resulted in a loss of Rs 749 crore to the state exchequer.
 
 Chamankar had invoked the RTI to secure a report submitted by the then DG Praveen Dixit to the then additional chief secretary (home) Amitabh Rajan on December 11, 2013. The ACB had submitted that there was no abuse of power by Bhujbal while allotting the contract for construction of Maharashtra Sadan, since the decision was taken by a cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure.
 
 On the charge that the cost of Maharashtra   was increased from Rs 52 crore to Rs 152 crore, ACB found that there was no substance in the allegation since the cost of the project was never fixed and there was no need for a further probe in the allegation.
 
 In his three-page letter, Chamankar referred to the letter written by Dixit to the government, saying, there was no substance in the allegations made in the Maharashtra Sadan scam and that further probe was not required. “Doubts have been raised over the report submitted by the architect on the cost of the project. From the documents obtained by us, it appears that even before the architect submitted his report, the ACB filed a criminal case against my family, assuming that the architect has submitted the report. Permission granted by the DG to register a criminal case against my family was bad in law,” he said, adding that the CM should conduct a transparent probe against the ACB over the manner in which the case was filed against him and his family members.
