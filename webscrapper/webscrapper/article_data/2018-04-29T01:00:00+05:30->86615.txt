PATNA: Assembly Speaker   on Saturday assured Bihar Veterinary Doctors’ Association (BVDA) members that he would make efforts to ensure that veterinary doctors were appointed as director of the veterinary wing of the animal husbandry department.

 In his inaugural address at the World Veterinary Day function at Adhiveshan Bhavan in Patna, the Speaker also said issues related to regularisation of veterinary doctors appointed on contract would also be looked into.
 
 Noting that animal husbandry is the backbone of the agriculture sector as it engages around 60-70% of women, the Speaker underlined the need to strengthen this sector as the agriculture sector without it cannot register significant growth. The primary healthcare system provided to attend to the health needs of cattle and other animals should also be made stronger, he added.
 
 Those who attended the function included former Jammu and Kashmir Agriculture University VC Dr Alauddin Ahmad, Dr K G Narayan from Ranchi Veterinary College as well as BVDA functionaries Dr Surendra Sharma, Dr Dharmendra Singh and Dr Viresh Prasad Sinha.
 
 A seminar on ‘Role of veterinary profession in sustainable development to improve livelihoods, food security and safety’ was also organised on the occasion, said function convener Dr Ajit Kumar. The World Veterinary Day falls on last Saturday of April every year.
