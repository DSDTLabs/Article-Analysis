LUDHIANA: A new twist has developed in the case of a 40-day-old infant who was sold by his father   to a Haryana-based woman   for Rs 2 lakh, and who was restored to her mother Pooja, after she complained to the police.

 When Pooja’s photo appeared in the newspapers with her baby, her ex-husband Tajinder Singh— from whose house in Kharar she had disappeared more than four years ago — identified her and informed the police. The Kharar police then checked their records and identified the infant’s mother (Pooja) as ‘dead’ in their records about four years ago. According to Kharar police, the woman had disappeared from the house of her previous husband in Kharar, after which her in-laws were booked under a dowry death case on the complaint of her parents, who live in Dhuri in the outskirts of Ludhiana. Unfortunately, her ex-husband and his parents spent 17 months in jail under the offence of dowry death.
 
 DSP   said: “The woman had disappeared from her house in 2013. Neither her in-laws nor parents knew about her whereabouts. On this, her parents suspected that her in-laws had murdered her for dowry, and dumped her body somewhere. On their complaint, the family was booked. However, the police could not trace Pooja’s body. But after over four years, through newspapers, we could trace Pooja. Today (Friday), the Kharar police handed her over to her parents. The police will produce Pooja before court in the next hearing of the case (which is already on in court), where her parents would identify her. Further action would then be taken as per the orders of the court.”
