KOCHI: The high court has ordered the management of Elephant Court   in Thekkady to surrender the premises as part of debt recovery proceedings. Kochi-based Vijaya Hospitality, which owns the resort, allegedly owes around Rs 36 crore to the  . 

 Elephant Court should be vacated by the resort group and handed over to the advocate commissioner appointed by debts recovery tribunal ( ) on January 18. After taking over possession and preparation of an inventory, the advocate commissioner should hand over the property to an authorized representative of Federal Bank, a single bench of the high court ordered.
 
 While Rs 26 crore was alleged owed by Elephant Court, another resort by the same group called Peppervine had defaulted repayment of a Rs 10-crore loan. While disposing two petitions filed by the resort group regarding each resort, the court said even new guests can be inducted into Peppervine but on payment of Rs 2.5 lakh on or before January 31. If such payment is not made, the resort group would risk removal of any guest, whether already booked or not, from the premises. Vacant possession of Peppervine should be handed over to the advocate commissioner on February 2 in the presence of bank officials if the payment is not done, the court ordered.
 
 As the bank has already taken possession of Elephant Court, except some quarters where resort employees are accommodated, it can continue. If the resort group settles the entire dues regarding both the resorts, the properties should be handed back, the judgment said. It was by the end of December last year that the bank took possession of Elephant Court on the strength of a court order.
