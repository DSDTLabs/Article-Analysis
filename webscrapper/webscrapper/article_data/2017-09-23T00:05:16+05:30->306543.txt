New Delhi: Hundreds of mediapersons gathered at Press Club of India on Friday to condemn the murder of Tripura journalist  , and adopt a resolution. 

 Bhowmik, who worked for a local TV channel, was abducted and killed while covering a road blockade by   People’s Front of Tripura on Wednesday. 
 
 Kalyan Baruah of North East Media   said 32 journalists have died in the northeast since militancy began. “In all 32 cases, not a single person has been convicted so far. There are around 120 militant outfits in the northeast who threaten and kill journalists when they are critical of them. The journalists are defenceless,” Baruah said. 
 
 He added that militants issue press releases and tell the newspapers to publish them ad verbatim. “If the editors edit the content of the press release, the militants target them. If they publish the content without editing, the government targets the editors,” said Baruah. 
 
 Rajdeep Sardesai highlighted the increasing vilification of journalists on social media. “There is a pernicious campaign to suggest that journalists only protest when somebody in a big city is attacked. It is a false and motivated campaign to divide journalists. It’s been on for a while,” he said.
