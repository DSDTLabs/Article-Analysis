An event that is all about luxury — that’s what the   hosted recently. And guess what? Every Chennaiite who loves super cool things was there. Some talked business, others caught up with what’s happening in Chennai’s ever-whirling social scenario. 

 The event also saw some of the city’s well-known faces put in an appearance. There was ace filmmaker   with Suhasini. Bharat and Bhakti Joshi quite literally added a bit of ‘sparkle’ to the event with their coordinated shimmery outfits. We also spotted the ever-dapper Ashok Amritraj (think of it, when there’s the word ‘luxury’ how can this man not be part of it?) All in all, it was an evening that celebrated the eclectic and the exclusive.
