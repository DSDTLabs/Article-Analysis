 "To ensure free and fair investigation into the matter, I have immediately suspended the member of faculty against whom the sexual harassment complaint has been received," Sarangi told TOI, adding that the University's sexual harassment committee will probe into the matter in detail and submit its report soon. 
 
 "On the basis of the findings of the committee, appropriate action will be initiated," said the VC.
 
 Members of the GSCASH will hold a meeting on Monday to probe into the matter. "We plan to hear the accounts of both parties in detail before arriving at any conclusion," said a member of the committee. 
 
 Sutar had allegedly been troubling the girl for the last few days. "He had been making unwanted sexual advances and passing lewd comments at me. When the trauma turned unbearable for me, I decided to bring the matter to the notice of the varsity authorities," said the girl.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Sutar could not be reached for a comment on this matter.
 
 In 2014, a girl student had alleged sexual harassment against a dean of the Ravenshaw University. The dean was subsequently transferred.
