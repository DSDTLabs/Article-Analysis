PANCHKULA: The Panchkula municipal corporation move of denying the contract for sterilisation and   to the lone interested party has angered residents. After a rabid dog bit more than 15 persons at Surajpur village on April 16, municipal commissioner   promised residents welfare associations (RWAs) to restart the process of sterilization and vaccination of stray dogs within a week. 

 On April 17, the   commissioner, after a meeting and with the consent of councilors, decided to start the process of sterilization and vaccination of stray dogs with a budget of Rs 30 lakh. 
 
 An online tender was also taken out by the civic body. Given the one-week notice, only one applicant expressed interest but MC officials did award the tender to him despite the gravity of the situation, said welfare association members. 
 
 Seema Bhardwaj, a social activist from Panchkula said, “The issue is in public interest. If one person has applied, MC officials should have given the tender to that person.” MC officials have again called a tender for sterilization and vaccination of stray dogs to be opened on May 4. 
 
 President, RWA, R K Aggarwal, said, “Dog bite cases are increasing by the day. In such a drastic situation, the MC should have given the tender to the one person who applied.” 
 
 Former deputy director of animal husbandry, Haryana, Dr M R Singla was the one who applied for the tender. 
 
 He said, “The issue was in public interest and that is why I applied for the tender as I have experience and knowledge in this field. I have requested MC officials to start the process.” He said the civic body could award the tender to one applicant in cases of emergency and public interest. 
 
 Senior MC officials said, “Issuing tender to one person is not possible as per the rules and they have re-issued the tender and are hoping that more persons will take part in the process.”
