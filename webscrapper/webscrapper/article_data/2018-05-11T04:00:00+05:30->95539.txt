Surat:  , BJP MLA from Majura Harsh Sanghavi has asked municipal commissioner to reveal the fact that he had never pitched for any private agency to purchase high-end dustbins. 

 In a letter to municipal commissioner M Thennarasan, he stated that the controversy revolves around the agency in question, Geelan International, which is the lone supplier of high-end dustbins. Each dustbin costs about Rs 45,000 and that the total proposal was for 154 dustbins valued at Rs 70 lakh. 
 
 The dustbin has stainless steel structure, is fitted with solar-powered LED screen for advertising and equipped with a separate collection of drums for wet and dry garbage of 33-litre capacity. The dustbins were to be installed in the constituency of Sanghavi. He had submitted the proposal to SMC to install high-end dustbins from his MLA grant.
 
 Opposition Congress accused him of misusing peopleâ€™s money and favouring a private agency. 
 
 Following the controversy, Sanghavi wrote to municipal commissioner on Wednesday asking him to stall the process of installing the dustbins. He stated that the SMC should follow the legal procedure before purchasing the dustbins. He said it was wrong to say that it was he who had advised the civic body to purchase high-end dustbins from Gilan International. Sanghavi further stated that during his first tenure as MLA or in the ongoing second term, he has never ever favoured any agency, recommended any agency, or was involved in the tender process of public work contracts.
