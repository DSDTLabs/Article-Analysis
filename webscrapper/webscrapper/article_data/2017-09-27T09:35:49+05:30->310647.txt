HYDERABAD: Days after inspecting the   at the University of Hyderabad, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) has instructed organisations, allegedly involved in polluting the lake, to install sewage treatment plants (STPs). 

 According to officials, executive engineers from GHMC conducted a thorough study to determine what kind of water is being discharged into the lake - storm water or sewage water - and the spots from where it is entering. 
 
 "We found that there is a long channel flowing from the   to the university. We have collected samples to determine what kind of water it is. However, we have instructed all organisations to install STPs to prevent further poisoning of the lake," said Harichandana, commissioner, GHMC west zone. . 
 
 GHMC has sent water samples to the   to check its toxicity levels. Officials said that setting up of STPs will cost between 25 lakh and 1 crore. While the GHMC is waiting for the TSPCB reports, UoH students have demanded the administration to block the sewage outlet on campus. "Since the flow is continuous, setting up STPs may be a futile exercise. The lake cannot be rejuvenated unless the flow from other organisations is completely blocked," said Ravi Jillapalli, founder of Wild Lens, a wildlife protection group at the university. 
 
 Raising concerns over release of funds for the STPs,Jillapalli, in a letter to UoH on Monday stated: "I have been rising this issue for the past five years... it's high time that the flow is blocked, in the interest of our rich biodiversity."
