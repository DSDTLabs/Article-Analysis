PANAJI: The Goa   management corporation (GWMC) has been reconstituted with the chief minister as its chairperson, but the board of directors has no representative from the non-government organisations (NGOs), sources said.

 Earlier, the board of directors had a senior scientist, an engineer, two well-known persons from the   sector, Patricia Pinto and K D Sadhale.
 
 As in the earlier board, directors of panchayats and municipal administration, besides bureaucrats, have been included, but no known environmental activists or personalities from the waste management sector have been included in the new one. 
 
 As per the notification issued by Levinson J Martins, director of science and technology department and also one of the directors of the waste management corporation, the other directors include two legislators,   and Michael Lobo, and panchayat leaders, Eknath Oraskar of Saligao and Shawn Martins of Calangute. 
 
 The corporation was formed only in December 2016, but it took another eight months for it to start functioning.
