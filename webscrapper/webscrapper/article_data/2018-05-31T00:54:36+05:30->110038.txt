Jaipur: Life has completely changed for 54-year-old Babu Lal Saini and 65-year-old Chhitarmal, residents of the city, who fought a long battle against cancer. Now they are cancer survivors. They have stopped smoking bidis and do not allow anyone in their houses to smoke or chew tobacco.

 Chhitarmal has lost a portion of his tongue and jaws and has difficulty in speaking. But he is happy that his life has been saved. “My surgery was conducted in 2003. I smoked bidi for 35 years. It is a long time. But I regret my habit of smoking bidi,” said Chhitarmal, who lives in Jagatpura area.
 
 Saini has a similar tale to tell. He started smoking when he was a teenager. He continued smoking for 20 years. In 2005, he was diagnosed with a throat cancer.
 
 He underwent a surgery and chemotherapy for one long year at a private hospital in Jaipur.
 
 He said that he had to quit his job because of his ill health and his children had to go out for jobs to support the family. 
 
 He said that tobacco consumption in any form not only causes cancer but also leaves behind a long trail of pain and agony.
