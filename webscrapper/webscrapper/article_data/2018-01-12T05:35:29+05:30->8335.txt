MUMBAI:   legislators   and   on Wednesday created a ruckus at Mulund’s   in protest against allegedly exorbitant fees and massive cost of medical supplies.

 “We are shocked at the exorbitant fees being charged. We have given the hospital management a week to take corrective steps, failing which wewill intensify our agitation,” Kinikar, who has been elected to the legislative assembly from Ambernath, toldTOI.
 
 “I have been toldthat if an X-ray or MRI is done in the night, an in-house patient has to pay double the amount. How can the hospital charge double fees from a patient who has been admitted?” Kinikar said.
 
 A Shiv Sena leader has sought a high-level probe againstthehospital.
 
 The Sena leader said seven dengue patients had died at the hospital in the recent past. “Each patient was admittedfor about20days and thebillcame to nearly Rs 20 lakh per patient. In another case, an accident victim was charged Rs28 lakh for his 28-day hospitalisation. We feel that in the interests of patient care, the government should conduct an independent audit of thehospital,” hesaid.
 
 Fortis Hospital had denied the charges. “We wish to highlight that hospital staff as well as patients, their relatives and thedoctor fraternity were deeply pained by the influx of the mob that hurled accusations and throngedthe premiseson Wednesday, creating disharmony in a caregiving environment,” a hospital spokesperson said. The hospital stated it was not aware of any dengue cases where Rs 20 lakh was charged and the patient died. “Our recordsdo notshow any such patient. Kinikar and Patil have submitted a letter and thehospital management islooking at the issues raised,” the hospital stated. The spokesperson said in the case of one patient who was treated for dengue shock syndrome, while no excess charges were levied in line with the request made by senior Shiv Sena leaders, concession was also given on thebill.
 
 The hospital has stated consumables are charged at MRP.
