KOLKATA: A state-run girls’ home in Liluah that has in the past faced allegations of ill-treatment and exploitation is eyeing a turnaround by roping in Bangladeshi fashion designer   to make the life of inmates meaningful. The celebrity designer has volunteered to go beyond the 10 days that she was initially approached for and set a six-month target to transform lives through involvement in creative pursuits. 

 “I am a fashion designer. That does not limit my existence to creating fancy clothes for the wealthy. There is an aspect linked to joy, pride and sustainability. In today’s world, one can go hungry for two-three days but one cannot step out without a piece of cloth. It protects our dignity and pride. When I was approached with the proposal to help transform the handloom units at the homes, I saw an opportunity to make a difference,” she said. She has been invited to help the homes run by the state women and child development and social welfare department and the West Bengal Commission for the Protection of Child Rights.
 
 On Thursday, when Bibi visited the Liluah home for the first time, the 200-plus girls, including 64 Bangladeshis and several Rohingyas from Myanmar, pleaded for help to return home. Bibi explained that legal help was not her forte, but what she could instead is make their humdrum lives interesting. By Saturday, several girls said the place was beginning to feel like a home.
 
 Bibi believes families that find it difficult to accept a girl who has been away from home for a while will change their outlook if the girls become financially independent. And that is what she has set out to do by teaching them contemporary designs in sari, gamcha and other accessories.
 
 “With Bibi charting out an ambitious plan to create items that have a market demand, we will approach the government for display and sale at retail points like Biswa Bangla,” said Santwana Saha, the home Super. Minister Sashi Panja has promised all help.
