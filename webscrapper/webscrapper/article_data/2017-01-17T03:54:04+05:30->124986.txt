New Delhi: An elderly couple was crushed to death when an over-a-century-old building collapsed in central Delhi’s   on Monday. Survivors claimed that the building was last repaired some 20 years ago.

 The   took place at 6am when the couple was asleep. It was a close shave for two of their children who were sleeping in the same room. At least nine other occupants of the building escaped with little or no injury.
 
 The deceased were identified as Uma Gupta (60) and Rajesh Gupta (65). Neighbours said the couple were staying in the area for 30 years. Uma, a school teacher, was nearing retirement. Her husband had retired three years ago. While their son, Karan, works in a BPO, the daughter, Isha, is a school teacher. “We were staying here on rent. The building was in a bad shape and I was always worried that it might collapse,” said Karan. 
 
 Seema Tahira, the local councillor, said: “I visited the site in the morning. It was a very old building and its wall had weakened due to moisture.” Kiran Sharma, a neighbour TOI spoke to, said he heard the couple cry for help early in the morning. “I realised that the house had collapsed when I saw a cloud of dust. I saw the others rush out,” said Sharma.
 
 “We wake up every day to fill water at 5 am, but there was no supply on Monday morning, so we went back to sleep. Our house has cracks too,” said Mukesh Gupta, Rajesh’s cousin and neighbour. 
 
 A case of negligence has been registered against the house owner at the local police station.
