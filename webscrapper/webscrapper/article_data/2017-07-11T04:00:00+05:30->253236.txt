Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) plans to develop a riverfront on the downstream of Tapi river and a barrage near Magdalla to make reservoir with 16 million cubic metre (MCM) capacity. This will provide another recreation centre and a 850-metre bridge across Tapi in addition to the causeway. 

 Consultants are preparing hydraulic designs for the barrage and based on that work would be undertaken and simultaneously riverfront development would also begin. 
 
 After nearly 10 years, it has been decided to build a one-kilometre-long barrage over Tapi river in downstream near Rundh-Magdalla. The barrage will be a gated structure and could be opened from top. The spot identified is about 10 km from Singanpore weir-cum-causeway. A riverfront will be developed along two sides of the stretch of Tapi that passes through Surat city. 
 
 Water and power consultancy services limited (WAPCOS) is working as a consultant for the barrage and preparing hydraulic design whereas HCP Design Consultants that prepared design for Ahmedabad riverfront and is designing riverfronts in Vadodara and Pune has been hired as consultant for the 10-km Tapi riverfront. Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI) will help in designing the final model based on storm drain lines going into the river. 
 
 This 10-km stretch of Tapi will have storage capacity of 16 MCM reservoir which would make total storage of 32 MCM as the weir-cum-causeway at Singanpore stores about 20 MCM of water.
 
 “The reservoir will recharge underground water and help retain water in Tapi 365 days,” said M Thennarasan, SMC commissioner. He said that final model and master plan would be ready latest by October this year.
 
 SMC plans to begin with the barrage and complete it in three years’ time at cost of Rs 200 crore.
