 "There was no bar to Sasikala becoming the chief minister but, the practical questions are there. There's my case in the Supreme Court regarding the disproportionate assets. She's also party to it. She is also one of the accused. So, it will be awkward if she becomes the CM," Swamy said.
 
 "Moreover, before she fights by-elections, the Supreme Court judgement will come. So, going by the reports that she is not going to stake a claim to become the Chief Minister, I think, it's a wise move," Swamy added.
 
 Earlier, a meeting of party lawmakers to be chaired by Sasikala on Sunday triggered speculations that she was set to replace chief minister O. Panneerselvam as the leader of the party.
 
 Senior leaders of the AIADMK, however, dismissed rumours of any imminent change in the party leadership and said the meeting was to facilitate better communication between the MLAs and the government.
