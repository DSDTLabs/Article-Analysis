NOIDA: Apart from making speed governors,   cameras and a GPS device mandatory in school buses, the advisory issued by the   on Thursday also makes parents “equally responsible” for their children’s safety, with one directive mentioning that the school authorities should “evolve a voluntary arrangement” such that any one parent be present in the school bus on every journey.

 Confused over the implementation of the directive, the parents termed it “impractical” and said that while their kids’ safety was a priority for them, it was not possible for parents to travel by the school buses.
 
 Principals too agreed that it would be very difficult to engage the parents in this exercise. “The school authorities are also directed to voluntarily evolve an arrangement, as far as possible, that in each school bus at least one parent should be present who would oversee the conduct of the driver and other staff present in the bus during the journey. This step would ensure that the safety measures are complied with in letter and spirit and the driver drives carefully,” the circular says.
 
 Niti Shrivastava, president, Gautam Budh Nagar Parents’ Association told TOI that while parents would be willing to go with their children to school, it was not feasible.
 
 “This means that you are putting the onus of the children’s safety on the parents. How can the parent be responsible for anything untoward that happens during the journey? If both the parents are working, how will they make it,” she asked.
 
 “Many children in Noida schools come from Sarita Vihar, Delhi and  . Those staying in Noida can join the journey but how will those coming from distant places return home,” Shrivastava said.
 
 Anoop Khanna, president, GBN Guardians’ Association said that making the parents part of school journey was not possible. “They might as well drop the child to school in their own vehicle rather than return by public transport,” he said.
