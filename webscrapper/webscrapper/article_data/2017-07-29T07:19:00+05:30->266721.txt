GURUGRAM: A team from the   (CPCB) on Friday collected groundwater samples from at least six locations in and around  .

 “Groundwater samples have been taken from active borewells in six different places in and around the Bandhwari village. These will be tested in the laboratory to check for contamination as per the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order,” said an official from CPCB, on condition of anonymity.
 
 The NGT had on Tuesday instructed the CPCB to carry out laboratory tests of groundwater samples from Bandhwari in the wake of a petition by city-based environmentalist Vivek Kamboj. The petitioner alleged that leachate from the defunct solid waste management plant in Bandhwari was flowing into underground aquifers, thereby contaminating the groundwater of the area.
 
 The CPCB team also met villagers. “A team from CPCB visited Bandhwari some four to five months ago. However, this time the team members met us and asked us about our concerns. We trust the green tribunal that a decision will be taken soon, keeping in mind the environmental protection of the area,” said  , a resident of Bandhwari, who led a group of villagers to the NGT last month during one of the hearings in the case.
