THANE: With an aim to encourage study and research on the various   of snakes in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Thane forest department and herpetologists have urged   to follow a standard   of rescue operations. 

 In an interactive session with snake rescuers across the MMR held in Thane on Monday, herpetologist   urged the   to maintain a record of rescued snakes, including their gender, specie, location, habitat and so on in order to set the groundwork for research operations. 
 
 “Looking for different species of snakes for any research is not possible as they are in the wild and their exact habitats are still unclear. However, in snake rescue operations all the crucial data about local snake species are easily available. If recorded in a standard format, it could provide a wealth of information for researchers,” said Bhide.
 
 Wildlife rescuers from a few prominent environmental organisations have started collaborating with forest officials and experts to come up with a standard format for documentation.
 
 Aditya Patil, treasurer of one such group based in the city, said, “Following the meeting, we have all been working on a format that encapsulates every necessary detail needed for research found during snake rescue operations.
