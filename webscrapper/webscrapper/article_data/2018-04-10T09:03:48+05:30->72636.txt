MUMBAI: This  , there will be 24 high-tide days when the sea level will be above 4.5m. Authorities will be on their toes on these days as there are chances of severe flooding in case it rains heavily. During high tides, authorities close the floodgates to stop the rising seawater from entering the city and if there is a downpour at the same time, rainwater finds no outlet. Last year, there were 18 high-tide days.

 
  
  
 
 The   will circulate the high-tide days’ list to other agencies like the fire brigade and traffic police so that they are ready for monsoon. June, July, August and September each have six such days (see graphic). The highest   of the season would be on July 15 at 4.97m. A senior BMC official said, “10   days fall on weekends and we have to take additional precautions.   and tourists freq uent seashores during monsoon and more so, on weekends. On such days, everyone from fire brigade to ward officials are kept on high alert.” 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 For the first time, the BMC will list out neap tide days. These are days when the difference between low and high tides is not much and the discharge of stormwater into the sea is very slow.
 
 
  
  
 
 
  In the probe report of gastroenterologist Dr Deepak Amarapurkar’s death, the BMC had pointed out that on August 29, when the doctor fell into a manhole and died, neap tide had caused prolonged and heavy flooding.
