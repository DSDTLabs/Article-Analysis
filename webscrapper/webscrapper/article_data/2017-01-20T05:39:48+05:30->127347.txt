BHOPAL: Second model rake of India, which has been manufactured at Nishatpura workshop, was pressed into mock-run at   on Thursday. 

 The rake comprising one first AC coach, two coaches of AC two-tier, eight sleeper coaches, four general coaches, two   and one pantry car, was tested before running it in Mahamana Superfast Express. The rake did not have AC III.
 
  Deputy chief mechanical engineer   said the rake was brought from Nishatpura workshop to Habibganj railway station as a part of its mock-run. "It was found shutters of coaches were not working properly, and had to be piled well," he said, adding coaches needed to be cleaned. 
 
 "The company, which was provided with tender of AC three-tier coach, was not financially strong to manufacture coaches. After the deadline, railway department withdrew its tender and issued it to a new company. There are three AC-three-tier coaches, which are yet to be added to the rake," said  , senior section engineer."
 
 The rake was then run to   for trial, which returned to Habibganj railway station yard.
 
  Post-mock run it was pointed that if new type of side sleeper is not suitable during the run, the design would have to be changed. "The design is not up-to-the-mark at present as sometimes middle part can get jammed and create difficulty in folding and unfolding," said Narsinghpurkar.
