Rajkot: Getting real-time data on pollution will soon be possible for city planners.

 The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) will install two continuous ambient air monitoring stations in the city, which will provide real-time figures of pollution. One station will be set up in the industrial area near ITI in Aji GIDC and another in the residential area in western zone office of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) near Big Bazaar on the 150-feet Ring Road.
 
 At present, this system is installed only in Ahmedabad and Jamnagar. The cost of each monitoring system is estimated to be Rs 1.5 crore. 
 
 The Central Pollution Control Board (CBCB) will provide 50% grant to GPCB for purchasing this equipment and the remaining amount will be borne by the state government. 
 
 H P Patel, GPCB’s regional officer at Rajkot, said “We have moved this proposal to track real-time pollution in the city. CBCB team and our senior officers have visited both these places and they will take final decision soon.” 
 
 The data of this monitoring system will be tracked live at GPCB offices Rajkot, Gandhinagar and CPCB office. 
 
 This system will give the data of particulate matter in the air of less than 2.5 and PM 10, which a human nose cannot filter and directly goes to lungs. It will also give data on gases and volatile chemicals in the environment along with sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide. 
 
 All the data will be displayed on roads for public consumption. “With the help of this data, we will be able to locate polluting industry and centres which will help us curb the pollution,” said Patel. 
 
 At present, GPCB manually monitors the pollution through an agency. The agency provides the data of three places — GPCB office, Kalavad Road fire station and Amul Industry near Aji GIDC.
