AMRITSAR: With speculations rife over entry of former AAP leader   ‘Ghuggi’ into the Congress, a section of party leaders in Punjab has decided to give a representation to the high command to keep the turncoats at a distance. Punjab Pradesh   Committee (PPCC) secretary Dinesh Bassi said, “You just try to understand the feeling of Congress workers, who despite fighting a decade long battle against the previous SAD-BJP leaders, are being ignored over turncoats.”

 Former convener of Punjab AAP, Ghuggi had unsuccessfully contested from Batala constituency in the 2017 assembly polls. He quit the party’s primary membership on May 10, after AAP leadership chose Bhagwant Mann to lead the party in Punjab and abolished the post of convener.
 
 Bassi, a Youth Congress leader, said he along with other party members would give a representation to PPCC president  , chief minister Amarinder Singh and vice-president Rahul Gandhi to apprise them of the discontentment among the workers on giving plum posts to turncoats.
 
  chief Jugal Kishore Sharma said, “Many party workers think that turncoats are given preference, but it is not so. Party always gives a priority to its cadre. However, we will bring the workers’ resentment to the knowledge of party high command.”
 
 Rumours are that Congress could invite Ghuggi to join the party and offer him to contest from Gurdaspur parliamentary constituency, which is heading for byelection after the demise of BJP MP Vinod Khanna. 
 
 ‘Ghuggi welcome, but without conditions’
 
 Senior Congress leader and Amritsar (West) MLA Raj Kumar Verka said Ghuggi was welcome to join the party but without any conditions. Asked about the resentment among many Congress leaders over reports of Ghuggi joining the party, he replied, “Everything is running smooth in the party. If the Congress leaders have any resentment they should discuss it with PPCC president.”
