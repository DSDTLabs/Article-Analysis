NAGPUR: Citizens from all walks of life attended a session where   expert Vimal Jhajharia shared the basics of  , the ancient Hindu tradition of architecture, at Chitnavis Centre, on Saturday. Radhika De and Yogita Chaudhari from Chitnavis Centre organized the talk under their programme ‘Parampara’. 

 Jhajharia, during the session, explained the root of the word ‘vastu’, ‘vas’ meaning to live and ‘tu’ being the lord and his energy. He believed that Vastu Shastra was all about combining the right kinds of energy through the direction of its flow and this energy in turn affects our daily lives. He believed that modification and destruction in the homes/workplaces was not necessary to undo all problems. But, simple solutions like using colourology to balance the energy disequilibrium can be really useful.
 
 Jhajharia’s said his father too studied Vastu and his interest was only piqued through him. He then went on to learn from the Himalayan Yogi Swami Murghananda Saraswati who also taught him how to use the Shankha or conch to purify the energy of a space.
 
 Through his funny anecdotes and an interactive session, the audience was engaged throughout. He explained the importance of the four directions in Vastu and of the five elements (Panchatatva) sky, air, fire, water and Earth in making up our world. He believed the ultimate goal of Vastu is to bring happiness and personal growth. Vastu according to him contains a sea of knowledge that has more realms of meaning waiting to be discovered.
 
 Speaking to TOI Jhajharia said, “I have travelled six continents to deliver my talks and have been on several radio shows too, it is very heartening to see that this science is being met with so much acceptance all over the world.” 
 
 The audience in an open session then asked Jhajharia questions related to their homes and he provided possible solutions to them.
