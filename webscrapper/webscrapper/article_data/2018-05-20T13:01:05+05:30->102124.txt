VADODARA: Doctors rushed to the Rajgadh village in Ghoghamba taluka of   district to examine an ailing woman there. The reason was not an epidemic or an outbreak, but the fact that the family of the centenarian woman had performed a surgical procedure on her without any expertise.

 The woman Nanda Chauhan, who is believed to be aged around 103 years had been bedridden since over two months. She had also developed a gangrene in her left leg. Off late the leg had also started smelling very bad despite regular dressing by family members.
 
 “The leg was in a bad shape since the last few weeks. I inquired with a few persons including doctors and other from the health sector regarding what could be done with her. They suggested that the infected flesh had to be removed,” said the elderly woman’s son   Chauhan.
 
 Gulab, who works with a state transport driver, said that the family had to treat his mother at home since she was very frail and had other fractures too. “She has a broken arm and a broken knee. She is in agony if we move her,” said Gulab.
 
 Last week, Gulab and others decided to remove the flesh from the wound on their own. When done by doctors the procedure is called debridement. “I don’t know if you can call this an operation, but we did it. Since then we have been dressing the would regularly and she has shown improvement,” said Gulab. He claims she has even started having soup and water regularly, something she could not do earlier.
 
 A team of doctors from Ghoghamba rushed to the residence on the driver and examined his mother on Saturday. “Things seem to be stable for now, but we will take a closer look at the wound again tomorrow. We knew about the case and the family had been taking dressing material from the primary health centre, but was reluctant to admit her,” said a doctor. He added that on Saturday too they had suggested again that the woman should be admitted, but the family was not convinced.
