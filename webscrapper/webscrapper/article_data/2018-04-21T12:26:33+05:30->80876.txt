PANAJI: Activists and environmentalists are still scanning the 35-odd page draft Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, 2018, but after a quick perusal, said that exchanging eco-fragile zones for economic gains would prove counter-productive in the long run. 

 “The objective of the CRZ norms is environmental protection and any changes that nullify this will be ecologically disastrous,” environmental activist   said.
 
 Protection to CRZ areas in terms of prohibited activities continues, but allowing economic activities within the 200m high tide line is likely to lead to more coastal concretization. “A mild effect of a storm on the west coast in Goa flooded beaches and shacks. Permitting more commercial activity is mindless,” secretary   said, adding that relaxing norms for business is completely counter-intuitive in the context global warming and storms surges.
 
  Stating that, overall, the changes lack a human face, environmentalist   said, “Reducing the distance from the high tide line for economic development will only worsen the combined effect of other environmental destruction.”
 
 Activists fear the local communities will face further displacement, threats to their livelihood. “The one signal that this draft clearly sends is that India’s coastlines are going to be launch pads of a new economic order—an order that has no place for traditional rights and customary uses,’   of The   said.
