 “On April 23, we had met Subendhu Adhikari, MiC, state transport in Kolkata and discussed issues related to the transport system of the Hills.

 This project will be a first of its kind in the region. First, GTA will have to renovate the old super market and then start the construction work. The GTA chairman said officials of transport department, civil administration and the council body would first inspect the old super market, that was constructed way back in 1975, before going ahead with the project.
 
 To solve parking problem in the Hills, GTA had earlier constructed two more parking lots, which were commissioned in February.
