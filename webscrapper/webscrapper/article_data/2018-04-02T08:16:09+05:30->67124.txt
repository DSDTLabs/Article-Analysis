 Angry family members and villagers sat on a dharna for hours outside   forest range since Sunday morning to seek compensation for the baby’s parents. The villagers also demanded steps to contain the monkey population in the region. “I lost my baby due to the negligence of the forest officials. Had they acted in time, my child would have been alive today,” said the infant’s father, Rama Krushna  .
 
 Senior forest officials met the agitating villagers and promised Nayak a contractual job in the department. They also gave him Rs 10,000, following which, the villagers called off the protest around 2pm.
