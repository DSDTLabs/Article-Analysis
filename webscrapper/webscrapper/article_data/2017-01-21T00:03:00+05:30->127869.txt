AJMER: Candidates who cleared eligibility examination for school lecturers from   (RPSC) are staging   outside the commission on the demand of providing jobs. They demanded that RPSC should file their reply in   soon to finish the litigation so that they could get the postings after counselling in different subjects. On Thursday the protest entered on fourth day and candidates from different districts are pouring in to support the stir.

 According to candidates, RPSC conducted an examination on July 17, 2016 for various school lectureship posts in 19 subjects for overall posts of about 13,000. Results of different subjects were declared in October and RPSC initiated counselling of eight subjects and provided jobs to about 2,000 candidates who cleared the examination.
 
 But in November 2016, Rajasthan High Court put stay on the process of selection on different petitions of candidates and asked RPSC to file the reply on this issue, “There are about 11,000 candidates eligible for posting throughout the state and awaiting the counselling process,” said candidates. They said the issue is that RPSC should file its reply in this matter in high court and put their view forcefully so that the litigation ends soon.
 
 We are unemployed and worked hard for this examination but now delay in the process is lading us in depression,” said another candidate. Protestors said that RPSC should file a plea for fast track hearing in this matter in high court so that eligible candidates should not wait long to get a job. Meanwhile, RPSC officials said that the legal department is taking care of this matter.
