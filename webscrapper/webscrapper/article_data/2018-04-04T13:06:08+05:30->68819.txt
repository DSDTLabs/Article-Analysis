BHOPAL: The state government on Tuesday accorded the   (MoS) status to five Hindu  , a move which was slammed by the opposition  . The MoS status has been accorded to Narmadanand Maharaj, Hariharanand Maharaj, Computer Baba, Bhayyu Maharaj and  .

  
  
 
 On March 31, these five religious leaders were appointed to a committee set up for the conservation of the Narmada river. As members of the committee, they have been given the MoS status, a GAD official said on Tuesday. However, Congress dubbed the decision as an attempt by the   to exploit religious sentiments of people for political gains.
 
 “It's a political gimmick. This is also an effort by the chief minister to wash off his sins. He ignored conservation of the Narmada. These saints should inspect where the state government has planted six crore saplings (along the river banks) as claimed by the CM,” said Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi.
 
  
  
 
 State BJP spokesperson Rajnish Agrawal, however, said the opposition Congress dislikes anything done in reverence to saints. “Saints and seers were accorded the MoS status to make their work of environment and river conservation more easy. They were largely roped in for the Narmada conservation work to ensure more public participation,” Agrawal said.
