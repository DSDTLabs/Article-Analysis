PUNE: Two years ago, four non-government organisations ( ) and some women’s collectives started on a mission to bridge the gap between rural and urban communities by exchanging grassroots ideas — and food. They called their initiative Good Food for All.

 
 The participants from the rural and tribal communities were to teach the participants from low-income urban communities how to make meals healthier yet more affordable, with more green and fresh vegetables on the plate. The urban NGOs and communities, meanwhile, were to share their know-how of marketing channels and the latest in the veterinary field with the women farmers, tribal, pastoral and nomadic communities.
 
 “Women do most of the work in the farms and are farmers in their own right. But no one wants to recognise this fact. So we decided to form a collective, identify small plots and farm vegetables and lentils that could be sold by us. Earlier, we did not know what to do with the excess crop. Agents would take the excess crop at a low price from us and make a profit. Today, we can sell directly to customers,” said  , a farmer from   who is also a part of Swayam Shikshan Prayog, one of the four main NGOs in the initiative.
 
 On Thursday, Nitya Ghotge, a veterinarian and part of Anthra, an agricultural resource centre, held an evaluation session. The participants were from the Satara-based AWARD and the Mumbai-based rights’ group YUVA. Many shared their experiences and brought with them a range of indigenous agricultural produce, including varieties of kokam, a staple cool drink during the summer months.
 
 “People in many communities do not eat good food, mainly because they cannot afford it. Through this programme, the urban communities got to know of the vegetables and fruits that the tribal communities consume. They have now started preparing similar food items at their common canteens,” said  , also from Anthra.
