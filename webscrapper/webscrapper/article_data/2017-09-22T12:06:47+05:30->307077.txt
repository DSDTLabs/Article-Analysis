JALANDHAR: Punjab unit of the BJP has termed approval of draft notification of farm debt waiver by the state cabinet as another fraud with the farmers of the state as it has been done when model code of conduct has already been imposed due to Gurdaspur   byelection.

 “It is in everybody’s knowledge that the   was going to be held in September-October, then why did the   government not issue the notification about farm debt waiver before September?” asked former BJP minister Manoranjan Kalia in a statement issued here on Thursday.
 
 “In the cabinet meeting, the chief minister had approved draft notification for farm debt waiver after the announcement of Gurdaspur byelection schedule and imposition of model code of conduct by the Election Commission of India, very well knowing that the EC will not approve issuance of the said notification. It is part of delaying tactics,” Kalia said.
 
 He also pointed out that when the approval in principle had been given by the cabinet to the policy of farm debt waiver and budgetary provision had been made in that regard, the notification of farm debt waiver should have been issued directly by the department concerned.
 
 “Thus the approval of draft notification of farm debt waiver is an exercise in futility. Basically exercise of approval of draft notification by the cabinet is made with a intent to hood wink voters of Gurdaspur parliamentary constituency,” Kalia said.
