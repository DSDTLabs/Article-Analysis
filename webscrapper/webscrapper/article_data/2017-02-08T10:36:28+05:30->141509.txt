He said while the employer was keeping their salary pending, he would give pay them salary after 2-3 months and the entire amount was spent on food and treatment of his leg. “If I’ll not be allowed to return and get treatment for my leg, then there is a possibility that my leg would have to be amputated,” he says in the video.
 
 He also alleged that he was taken to office and was asked to sign on a paper (receipt) of Riyals 55,000, but he refused even as they forced him to sign the paper.
