 Rahul Kumar, one of the team members, said their technology will reduce the delay in supply for customers, who end up waiting for a few days to weeks. . As a result, it will also help cut cost for both customers and distributors, who spend to stock up additional cylinders anticipating requirement.

 Kumar said they have tied up with   to pilot test their device in houses across   starting February.
 
 The device works on strain gauge load sensors placed on the four corners of a stand onto which the LPG cylinder is placed. The sensors attached stand is connected to a micro controller or a microchip at home, while the distributor will maintain a database of all his customers and supply in a cloud server.
