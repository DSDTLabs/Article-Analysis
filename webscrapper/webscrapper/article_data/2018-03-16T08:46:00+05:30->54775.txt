MUMBAI: Most of the matches have a couple of defining individual performances. The T20 Mumbai League match between   and   was not only one sided, it had only one performer as well. Sobo Supersonics wicketkeeper bat,   smashed a brilliant 53-ball 83 to help his side to a modest 149. In reply, the Blasters could only manage 99 to hand Supersonics a win by 50 runs.

 
 In a match that was reduced to 18-overs-a-side due to a slight drizzle, Blasters won the toss and chose to field. And they did fairly well to restrict the Supersonics to 149. Despite the likes of Jay Bista (15) and skipper Abhishek Nayar (8) in their ranks, the Supersonics failed to get going. It was only because of the efforts of Pawar that Supersonics could get to the target that they eventually did.
 
 In reply, the Blasters kept losing wickets regularly and never really threatened to chase the target down.
 
 
  Sobo Supersonics 149-6 (Prasad Pawar 83, Akarshit Gomel 31; Azhar Ansari 3-21) beat Namo Bandra Blasters 99 (Shreyas Iyer 25; Abhishek Nayar 3-17, Rohan Raje 3- 24) by 50 runs.
