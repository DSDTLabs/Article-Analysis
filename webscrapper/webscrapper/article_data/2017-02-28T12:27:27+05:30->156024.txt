CHENNAI: The city's honeymoon with pleasant nights may soon be over, as cloud cover is expected to keep it warm even well after sunset. If it is any solace, however, the same cloud cover will keep the temperature from soaring during the day. Weathermen add that some parts of the state may receive light showers in a week. 

 When the skies remain clear, solar radiation reaching the earth's surface during the day is reflected back into the atmosphere. Clouding over the next one week is likely to keep the incoming radiation trapped near the surface. As a result, the night that follows will be warm. The days, however, will get cooler as cloud cover will minimise the radiation reaching the earth's surface. Weathermen say the loss of tree cover to cyclone Vardah will not cause an increase in temperature as Chennai is a coastal city. Regional   former deputy director general Y E A Raj said, "Trees provide moisture to cool the surrounding. Fortunately we get enough moisture from the coast."
 
 According to   Weather chief meteorologist  , a cyclonic circulation is developing over southwest Bay of Bengal. Palawat said, "It may bring scattered convective showers to the city between March 2 and 4." Convective showers occur due to build of daytime heat combined with some other conditions. There is a possibility of rainfall in the southern and western interior districts of Tamil Nadu. Chennai and surrounding districts, however, are less likely to get rainfall.
 
 The maximum and minimum temperature on Monday was 30.9 degrees Celsius and 23 degrees Celsius. The sky will remain partly cloudy on Tuesday and Wednesday. The following days, however, may produce light rain or thundershowers in the city. The average rainfall during March in the city is just 4mm.
