PUNE: Villagers in  , while battling  , came up with ' ' (DRC) to keep in touch with the outside world. They have set up a free cyber cafe with over a dozen computers with internet cables. 

 Youths, who have migrated, came together to connect their village with the world. The experiment has enabled free internet access to all, not just from this village, but also from surrounding areas. 
 
 Villagers are using the connectivity to book movie tickets, shop online and avail public services. The open and free access has helped farmers look for online commodity prices. Students explore academic and career options. 
 
 Chief minister   was all praises for the project. "Public participation is a key to making such projects a success," Fadnavis said. He added that the initiative must be imitated in other villages. "Today, there is a digital divide between urban and rural areas. Resident and non-resident villagers joined hands and the project came up as a crowdfunding effort. We have not taken any funds from the government. Latur's guardian minister   encouraged and supported the initiative," Prashant Girbane, who is part of the project, said.
 
 The DRC looks like a cyber cafe and villagers ensure a strict protocol with filters and website bans. To regulate traffic at the centre, each user is given a 30-minute ticket. Women are taking a keen interest in surfing and many come with their school-going children.
