Coimbatore: A newly-laid road has caved in at Podanur in the city on Friday. The road laid by the state highways department a month ago has caved in after a water pipeline began leaking in the area. An official from the highways department said, “The 1.5km-road was laid recently under the flyover project estimated at Rs 24 crore. But on Wednesday, the residents complained of the road caving in and water pipeline leaking in the area. We immediately informed the city corporation officials, who inspected the area. Once after they fix the pipeline leakage, we will re-lay the road.”  The official said that the civic body was asked to check for all pipeline leakages before laying the road. “Only after they gave a clearance, we laid the road. But either during the road laying process or due to some other water pressure, the pipeline has been broken,” said an official. The civic body engineer said that he has visited the spot and will repair the leakage soon. “Within a day or two, the pipeline leakage will be fixed,” said an engineer. The highways project meanwhile is nearing completion and will be inaugurated in June.  J Daniel, a civic activist who lives close-by, said most of the water pipelines of the civic body have been leaking for the past few months. “The roads are also not laid properly. We have complained to the officials several times,” he said. He added that a lorry had got stuck in that road a day ago, causing traffic congestion. Architects called for a better management of utilities by taking them to the road sides so that road engineering is not affected, and repair work will not consume much money. “If all the utilities are taken to the road sides, the entire process will become not just cost effective but less time consuming,” said an architect.
