Jalandhar: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Malkiat Singh Sidhu had survived a bid on his life by Jaspal Atwal and his three other associates in Canada, but was assassinated in last week of April 1991.

 He was killed along with his bodyguard when he was contesting from two seats as candidate of Shiromani Akali Dal led by Barnala. “The former Punjab minister was contesting from two seats Moga 1 (now Moga) and Moga 2 (now Baghapurana) when he was gunned down,” said his son Jaspal Singh Sidhu. “He was targeted because he was a minister in Barnala government. The attack on his was due to ideological reasons as we did not know those attempted to take his life in Canada,” he said.
 
 Sidhu was one of the 24 candidates killed by the terrorists. While all Akali factions were contesting, the Congress had boycotted the election. However the Election Commission countermanded the election a day before the polling.
 
 Sidhu was a practising lawyer in Moga and for the last 22 years annual sports tournament is being held in Moga in his memory. “He was helpful to all and fought several cases for free where the litigants could not pay and had no personal animosity but faced bullets twice for no personal reasons,” said Jaspal.
