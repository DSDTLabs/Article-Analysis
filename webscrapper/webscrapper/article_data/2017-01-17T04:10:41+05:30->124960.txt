New Delhi: Keeping the   in mind, the cash-strapped   on Monday unanimously passed a resolution to abolish conversion charges, a major source of its revenue. The resolution recommends to the Centre, through DDA, to “exempt the property owners, who have paid annual conversion charges from 2006-07, from further payment of mixed use charges”.

 The move comes at a time when civic officials are saying that the corporation would struggle to pay its employees in February and March. However, V P Pandey, the leader of the house, said the move would benefit over 1.25 lakh traders and shopkeepers. “They are already hard pressed by  , electricity and water charges. It was assumed that in return of conversion charges, we would provide them with infrastructure facilities such as parking but due to non-availability of land, it could not materialise even after 10 years.”
 
 The corporation got over Rs 130 crore as conversion charges in 2012-13, Rs 117 crore in 2013-14, Rs 106 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 145 crore in 2015-16. During the current financial year, around Rs 100 crore has already been collected. But Pandey said, “Just for earning revenue, we can’t keep on targeting a particular community. Even Master Plan 2021 mandates it for a temporary phase but no time period is specified.” 
 
 The step is being seen as an attempt to pacify BJP’s traditional vote bank of trader community that has seen 65-75% dip in business during initial days of the demonetisation. If executed, over 50,350 properties will be exempted — 4,500 in city, 8,200 in  , 10,000 in Rohini, 13,000 in Civil Lines and over 13,500 in   zones. The proposal does not exempt those who have not paid the mixed use charges since 2006. “The newcomers may be charged 10 times the annual charge to be paid in quarterly instalments,” the resolution specified. Although the opposition supported the move, Mukesh Goyal, its leader, said, “This, too, will turn out to be an empty promise meant to seek publicity before the polls.”
