Alwar: Replying to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s allegation that Congress and drought are twin brothers during the commencement of work at Barmer refinery a few days back, former chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that Congress is also the creator of NREGA, an antidote to drought. 

 Gehlot said, Congress gave jobs to the people and paid them in cash and kind while the BJP only looted people. “BJP leaders are now afraid of the people who gave them an overwhelming majority of 163 seats in the last assembly polls, but they have failed to deliver in the last four years,” he alleged.
 
 Gehlot said that BJP had alleged when he was chief minister he begged for wheat in Delhi during the drought. He said, “During my time, no farmer died of starvation or committed suicide.”
 
 He alleged that farmers are committing suicide under BJP rule and law and order is at its worst. Women are not safe and incidents of rape are the order of the day. “The chief minister has been sleeping for the last four years and now she is camping in the bypoll constituencies,” he said.
 
 “The chief minister is meeting caste leaders and giving out threats, inducements,” alleged the former chief minister. 
 
 He alleged that BJP government had stopped many projects, including water to   from Chambal, Metro and fast train projects. 
 
 Gehlot said, “The PM has took the bullet train to Gujarat and people are still waiting for the ‘good days’ promised by him.” 
 
 BJP thrives on lies and Jumla, he added.
 
 Narrating the achievements of his party, Gehlot said, it was Congress which launched old-age pension, food security, and subsidy to the farmers but BJP had reduced the subsidy. If the voters give a shock to this government in the bypoll, they could expect some relief in the upcoming budget, he said.
