NOIDA: The evening   in district hospital has been shut down by the authorities. The chief medical officer ( ) had started the evening OPD in October 2017 after several complaints had been made to the higher officials in the state government regarding the non-availability of doctors post 2pm. However, the OPD faced much trouble since its inception. 

 The OPD started with two doctors appointed in the evening shift which was from 2-8pm. However, in the beginning, only one of the doctors, Dr  , was available for the evening OPD. After Dr Shailat complained about lack of an attendant in the evening shift and that he was the sole doctor present to handle the patients, other doctors too were deputed on a rotational basis. Officials confirmed that four doctors were rotated at the evening OPD. 
 
 “There were a lot of issues between the emergency staff and doctors in the evening OPD. As the emergency staff would refer some cases to the evening OPD doctors, they did not like it,” one of the doctors working at the hospital told TOI. Now, the doctors deputed in the evening shift are being again transferred in the morning shift.
 
 The chief medical superintendent (CMS), Ajay Agrawal, said, the evening OPD was an experiment which didn’t work. 
 
 “The evening OPD was started on an experimental basis and was to be rolled out across the state had it been successful. However, it was found ineffective as few patients came in evening. There is a lot of rush in the morning and hence, the services of the doctors are being utilised in the morning,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, CMO, Dr  , said, he was not aware that the evening OPD service was stopped. The department had felt a need to start the evening OPD at the district hospital as there is only one doctor available after 2 pm in the emergency wing of the hospital, where around 3,0004,000 patients come for treatment everyday.
