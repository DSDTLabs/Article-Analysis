This will continue as long they have funding but when the investments stop, they will have to find a sustainable business model.

 The whole issue revolves around whether governments have a   for cities. We are still not clear about regulations for cabs and aggregators.

It is a myth that the taxi companies will alone solve the   in India. The number of buses is larger than the number of cabs with Ola and Uber.   would have definitely gone up with cab drivers protesting in Bengaluru.
