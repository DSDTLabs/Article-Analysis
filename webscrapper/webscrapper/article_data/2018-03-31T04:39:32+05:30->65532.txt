NEW DELHI: Mediation is picking up as a popular mode of dispute resolution, particularly at the district level, where people are preferring to resolve disputes at the Alternate   rather than courts. 

  The number of cases referred by the courts to   in districts have shown a sharp increase in the past few years in some states. Centres in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Rajasthan and UP have 35,000 to 75,000 cases listed for mediation at the ADR centres. 
 
  In a statement before   last week, minister of state for law P P Chaudhary said from 2.07 lakh cases received at district centres in 36 states and   in 2015-16, it has gone up to 2.91 lakh cases in 2016-17. And in the nine months between April-December 2017-18, it has already crossed 2.59 lakh. 
 
  According to Chaudhary, while 53,000 cases were settled in 2015-16, the next year more than 93,700 cases were settled. During April-December 2017, already 77,500 cases have been settled through mediations at the ADR centres. 
 
  "Legal Services authorities are engaged in promoting the use of ADR mechanisms," the minister said of centres set up in states that deal with matters referred to them by courts. 
 
  Courts are also encouraging mediation at pre-litigation stage in marital disputes besides civil and criminal matters. 
 
  The government is promoting ADR mechanism through mediations to bring down the pressure on the regular courts which are having huge pendency of cases. The subordinate courts in the country have more than 2.69 crore cases pending.
