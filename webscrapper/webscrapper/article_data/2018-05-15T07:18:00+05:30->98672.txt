Ghaziabad: Complainants of theft, loot or snatching incidents, in which the accused are unidentified, will no longer have to visit police stations for registration of  . On Monday, the police activated 58 of its   police response vehicles (PRVs) with a system to convert complaints received in the control room into FIRs.

 In accordance with the system, the PRVs have been provided with forms to record details of the complaints received.
 
 “In many instances, complainants were found to be under the impression that dialling the control room itself amounts to registration of an FIR. The forms will be filled up by cops manning the PRVs wherever the accused are unidentified in cases of loot, theft or snatchings. The signature of the complainant will be procured by the PRV personnel when they visit the scene of crime. The signature of the complainants will be recorded on these forms and sent to the concerned police station. The police station will register the FIRs. The complainant will not be required to visit the police station,” said SSP Vaibhav Krishna.
 
 The forms will be filled in triplicate out of which one will be provided to the complainant and the second to the police station. 
 
 The third form will be maintained in a booklet by the PRV. According to police, Ghaziabad is the first district in UP to undertake this initiative. The initiative has been undertaken to verify the number of genuine complaints received by the control room.
