Gurgaon: A man in his 50s has been booked for allegedly molesting a nine-year-old girl when she was playing in a park near her house at Maruti Vihar in Chakkarpur village on Tuesday. 

 The girl immediately rushed home and told her mother about the incident, but the accused had fled by then.
 
 According to police, the girl was playing in the park around 7.20pm on Tuesday when an unknown person in his 50s approached her and started talking to her. 
 
 He then allegedly touched her inappropriately and tried to coax her into going with him. Scared, the girl ran home and told her mother about the incident. Her mother came to the park with her to confront the man, but he had already fled. The girl’s father moved police and lodged a complaint the next day.
 
 “My daughter said that the man was around 50 years old. He spoke to her for a while and touched her inappropriately. My daughter realised his intentions and quickly ran away from the park. She went home and told her mother about the man’s ‘bad touch’. My wife went to the park, but the man was not there. My daughter can recognise the person. A similar incident happened in the park in the past as well,” the girl’s father said in his complaint.
 
 On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was registered against the unidentified man under Section 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Sector 29 police station on Wednesday.
 
 “We have registered a case and are trying to identify the accused. We will make his sketch with the help of the minor and other eyewitnesses. The accused will be arrested soon,” said inspector Vikas Kaushik, station house officer of Sector 29 police station.
