KOCHI: Inefficiency and callous attitude of the corporation authorities have resulted in the civic body losing Rs 44 lakh for a   that never took off. 

 It was in 2010-11 that the corporation launched the installation of radio frequency identification (RFID) for tracking hoardings in the city for plugging the loss on advertisement tax. It was   who procured the RFID equipment from a private firm and installed the system. Later, it was found that the RFID was defunct due to a glitch in the battery which supplies power to the system. The private firm which supplied the equipment offered to rectify it by purchasing new battery. But, they demanded another Rs 9 lakh for the purpose. The corporation authorities turned down the offer and refused to pay the cost as per the agreement with Keltron. 
 
 "Then, the private firm moved the court. As the corporation counsel failed to defend the case properly, the court ordered to give the payment to the private firm," said C K Peter, LDF councillor from Konthuruthy. After the setback, the court filed a review petition. But the same lawyer who failed to defend the case in the first instance was again assigned to appear on behalf of the corporation. But the review petition is yet to come up for hearing, even after a year"   said.
 
 Now, the system has become useless as the government took over the power of the local bodies to collect advertisement tax. 
 
 "So, the inefficiency and callous attitude of the corporation authorities have seen Rs 44 lakh going down the drain," Peter said.
