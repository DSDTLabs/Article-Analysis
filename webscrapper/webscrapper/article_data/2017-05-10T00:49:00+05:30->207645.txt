Belagavi: The district forest police mobile squad raided a house at Vannur village in Bailhongal taluk and recovered three owls from them on Monday.

 Chandrappa Mallappa Mirji of the same village catches the endangered owls and supplies it to interested parties in Goa for black magic, said police.
 
 The police team reached the village plainclothes hoping to nab Chandrappa. However, he managed to give them the slip. Ironically, police could not identify him as they did not know how he looked. Chandrappa was present in the house when it was raided. 
 
 PSI K S Kocheri said that the accused used to catch owlets from the forest and feed them and fatten them. He then used to sell them for a small fortune to practitioners of black magic in Goa. Owls and its various body parts are used by tantriks for black magic rituals. “We are trying to arrest Chandrappa and crack the network,” said police.
 
 The recovered owls will be produced before the court and then handed over to the assistant conservator of forest of Belagavi.
