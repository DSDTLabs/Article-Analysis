PANAJI: Upping the ante against planning and development authorities (PDA), the state   unit on Thursday demanded that all PDAs in Goa should be scrapped. Though the Congress has supported the agitation against the  , it has never come out openly and demanded that the PDAs be scrapped.

 Party MLAs for St Cruz and St Andre, Tony   and Francis   came out and demanded that the town and country planning (TCP) department must immediately “listen to the voice of the people who have come on the road” and scrap the PDAs.
 
 “TCP minister Vijai Sardesai must immediately issue a letter to the town planner and proclaim that the PDA is scrapped,” Fernandes said.
 
 Along with Fernandes and Silveira, former union minister for law   and spokesperson Yatish Naik also demanded that the existing PDAs should be scrapped.
 
 The Congress also claimed that due to chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s continued absence, there was a “complete breakdown in constitutional machinery” leading to an impasse in government functioning.
