After much speculation on who would host the second season of   since   has started his own political party, it is now confirmed that the   himself will host the show. There were rumours doing the rounds that Jayam Ravi or Arvind Swami might host the show that airs on a popular television channel. But Kamal is taking some time off from his film and political commitments to host the second season.
 
 A source tells us, “The promo shoot happened yesterday in a film studio. The show is likely to be telecast from the first or the second week of June. The participants are being finalised now.” 
 
 Given that the first season was enormously popular, the source says that the second season would be even bigger. Kamal hinted at his political journey throughout the previous season and eventually announced that he would join politics, so expect some political announcements in this season, too.
