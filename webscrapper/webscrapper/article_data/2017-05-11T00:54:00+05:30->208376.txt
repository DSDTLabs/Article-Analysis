Mangaluru: The first additional district and sessions court on Tuesday sentenced two persons to life imprisonment, holding them guilty of murder. 

 The accused are Uday Kumar, 38, resident of Bagambila in Kotekar and Lancy Dâ€™Souza, 35, resident of Santhosh Nagar, Pandit House in Permannur. They were accused of murdering Yatish Kumar, resident of Saraswath Colony, an autorickshaw driver following a quarrel over a petty reason in a bar on August 15, 2014.
 
 The incident took place at a bar in Thokkottu where the accused stabbed Yatish with a knife. The court acquitted Vinay, the third accused in the case over lack of evidence. The judge C M Joshi also directed the accused to pay a fine of Rs 20,000 each. In case of default in paying the fine, the judge directed them to undergo six months imprisonment. 
 
 The judge also directed the district legal services authority to provide compensation to the wife of Yatish Kumar. Raju Poojary Bannady, public prosecutor aruged the case for Yatish. A case was registered at Ullal police station.
 
 What led to murder
 
 Police said that disparaging remarks that Lancy and his friends made over a karaoke song that Kailash Babu, friend of Yatish, was singing at the bar led to the incident. When Yatish objected to the same, it led to heated arguments between him and Lancy and his friends. Lancy summoned his friends Uday Kumar and Vinay Kumar to the bar over phone. When Yatish and his friends were leaving the bar, the trio allegedly continued the fight and stabbed him.
