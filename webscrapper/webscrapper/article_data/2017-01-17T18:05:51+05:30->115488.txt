Ajith, who made the phrase Vaazhu Vaazhavidu popular, has been the inspiration for Nayanthara-starrer  's next single, Vaazhavudu, which has lyrics written by   ShivN. Talking about the song, composer   says, 'We are all   fans. We wanted to write something positive and create an impact. Vignesh suggested that we take this as a hook line and write a song. That's how Vaazhavudu was developed. The song is rendered by Vivek Siva (the other composer of the film) and Sanjana Divaker Kalmanje. This one's an energetic number.' 

 Ask him about working with Vignesh and he says, 'With Vignesh, the working experience is different. It was more like a fun jamming session. He's very spontaneous with his lyrics. He just heard the song, kept typing on his phone and eventually, gave us beautiful lyrics. We have been friends even before we met for this song, so that has helped us, too. The song will be the second single to release after Enga Pora Dora. Mervin adds, 'We wanted to release all the songs as singles as we want the listener to enjoy each song. We want the songs to grow on them one by one.'
