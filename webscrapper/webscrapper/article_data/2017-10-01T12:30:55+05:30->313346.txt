KHANNA: An effigy of Ravana with a head missing at the Military ground here evoked curiosity among onlookers and also kicked up a storm on social media ahead of Dahan. The 50-feet tall effigy installed at the venue had only nine heads. The pictures of effigy showing nine heads soon became viral incurring sharp reactions from a section of netizens and outfits. 

 Though Dussehra Committee   (DCK) tried to cover up while claiming that the effigy of Ravana which was burnt in the ground in fact had 10 heads and the one not visible was a revolving head, onlookers could spot only nine. Interestingly, local MLA   Singh Kotli too had visited the place to oversee the preparations ahead of Ravana Dahan. Despite repeated attempts, Gurkirat could not be contacted. 
 
 Soon after the news of Ravana with nine heads spread and its images started doing the rounds on social media, DCK president Vishal Kumar Bobby issued a clarification claiming that the effigy indeed had 10 heads and the 10th one was revolving and placed towards the rear side and was thus not visible to onlookers from the front. 
 
  former Chairman Dusshhera Committee, Khanna meanwhile claimed that the DCK had committed a blunder and made fun of the Hindu religion. Local   leader   while blaming the DCK for the lapse demanded that the administration should seriously look into the lapse.
