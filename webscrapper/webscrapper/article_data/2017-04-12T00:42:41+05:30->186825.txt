Gurgaon: The Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority ( ) is likely to come into effect this month. State   Rao Narbir Singh told TOI on Tuesday the state government would promulgate an ordinance next week to set up the GDMA within this month.

 “The next cabinet meeting is on April 18, in which we will get the ordinance passed and send it to the governor for his approval, so that the GMDA comes into existence within this month itself. I can assure you that there will not be any further delay in this matter,” he said.
 
 The state government came under severe criticism last month for failing to introduce the draft GMDA bill in the budget session of the Haryana assembly. The Khattar government then said it was because it could not circulate the Hindi version of the same among the members of the assembly.
 
 But, Rao Narbir, also the Badshapur MLA, said the state government would also introduce the bill in the next session of the assembly. “In the meeting on April 18, we will also take a decision on when to have the next assembly session, mainly to discuss the GST. In that session, we will introduce the GMDA bill and hope it will be passed,” he said.
 
 The GMDA authorities, however, said they have not heard anything concrete so far. “All that we know is that the chief minister has approved the bill and it will now be discussed in the cabinet before it is sent to the governor. There has been no communication from Chandigarh in this matter,” said an official, on condition of anonymity. The GMDA has been hanging fire for almost six months now. During a visit to the city in mid-2016, CM Manohar Lal Khattar had announced that the GMDA would be formed on November 1 to coincide with the 50th Haryana Day celebrations.
