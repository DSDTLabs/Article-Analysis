KOLKATA: In an observation on Friday, Calcutta high court acting Chief Justice   threw a question, asking “what harm is there if the CBI and not the state police investigates the sting operation to find out whether there was any crime or illegality“. This observation was made during a hearing of the Narada case by a division bench of the acting Chief Justice and Justice   .The bench was hearing three PILs seeking a CBI probe into the Narada sting operation case. Concluding his argument in the case, state advocate general Jayanta Mitra responded to the obervation saying the court had no jurisdiction to entertain such PILs based on the video showing Trinamool leaders accepting money. The video, he said, had not produced any evidence of crime.

 Appearing for six respondents shown in Narada video,   opposed the PILs and submitted that on March 14, two weeks after the election notification, this video was played during a press conference in the BJP office.
 
 Banerjee said, “Narada chief   claimed in his affidavit that he was doing his work as a journalist by carrying out the sting operation. But a real sting operation is one that shows actual bribe taking by public servant. But in this case, the journalist himself posed as a businessman and offered money .“ The acting Chief Justice observed that the sting video on former BJP chief   too didn't show him demanding money . The case will again be heard on January 12.
