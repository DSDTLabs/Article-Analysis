Panaji: Four theories are floating about the fire at 5.45am at the Kadamba bus terminus, Panaji, and who first alerted fire officials. The first theory is that an interstate bus driver saw smoke and drove the bus into the terminus from the exit point. He immediately informed the fire force and fire tenders rushed to the site. The second theory is that KTC bus conductor Atmaram Gawas saw dark smoke at around 6am when he went to answer nature’s call. Gawas said when he was in the washroom, the power went off and when he came out in 10 minutes, he saw dark smoke around the bus stand. Gawas said he informed his supervisor and they alerted the police and fire force about the blaze. The third theory is taxi drivers saw the smoke and informed the RTO. “At around 5am, taxi drivers were looking for passengers. While strolling around the building, they heard rats squeaking. When they inspected the source of the sound, they saw smoke coming out of Presidential Supermarket and on further examination realized that its shutters were hot. They alerted the transport authorities,” sources from RTO, Panaji, said. The fourth theory is that a private bus operator informed the KTCL managing director about the incident. “KTCL managing director Derek Pereira Neto directed him to call the fire department. Within minutes three fire brigades turned up at the site,” KTCL sources said. Fire and emergency services said they received a call from the police control room about the blaze at 6.15am.
