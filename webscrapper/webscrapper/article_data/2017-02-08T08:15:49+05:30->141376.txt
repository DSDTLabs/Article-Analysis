JAIPUR:   (BARC) held a   across the state over recent months to assess needs and build public opinion on what the government needs to pay attention to, in the Budget.

 In a set of recommendations issued as a press release on Tuesday, BARC said that better qualified teachers need to be appointed in state schools. Also, teachers should be given accommodation near schools. The state must also review the decision to merge schools as children are deprived in parts of tribal and western  , where the distance they have to commute to get to school would be stupendous.
 
 The health   saw a small decline last year. The free medicines and diagnostics scheme needs to be strengthened. Preventive healthcare should get a fillip, BARC said, advocating for proper vaccination, safe drinking water and sanitation. BARC and its associates also called for proper implementation of the National Food Security Act. Minimum support price for pulses and grains like wheat should also be properly implemented.
 
 In agriculture, the group called for better training to women as there is what it termed a “feminization of agriculture“. The budget should also provide for cattle during drought, it said. Minimum wages must be hiked under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, and budgetary provision for this must be increased. The allocation for minority affairs is extremely low and must be hiked, participants at the workshops held by BARC said. There should be centres offering accommodation to women who have faced sexual abuse or domestic violence, during the period of their rehabilitation. Anganwadi workers are mostly women, and their salaries are extremely low ­ this should be hiked to at least Rs 15,000. Schemes and budgetary allocation should also be made for the proper care of people who are differently abled.
