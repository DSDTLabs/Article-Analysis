KOLKATA: The way   skipper   and AB de Villiers were batting at one stage, it looked like the visitors would end up with a 200-plus total against   at the   here on Sunday.

 
 While they only managed 176/7 in the end, it could have been enough if not for   smacking a 17-ball 50 to pave the way for a four-wicket victory.
 
 "Definitely, the turning point was Narine's innings. If you get a start like that in the first six overs, 50 per cent of the game is over. There was not much left for the rest of the batsmen to do," RCB batsman   said at the post-match conference.
