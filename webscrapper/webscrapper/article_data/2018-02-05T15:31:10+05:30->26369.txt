NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister   on Monday hit back at Prime Minister  , asking him to back his remarks about "rampant" corruption in the state with facts.

 
 Siddaramaiah also asked PM Modi for a dignified and factual electoral battle.
 
  
  
 He claimed that Modi was "morally not right to be PM of the country."
 
 "What moral right does Narendra Modi have to talk on Lokpal when he did not have a Lokayukta for 9 years when he was CM? He is facilitating corruption. He is morally not right to be PM of the country," he claimed.
 
 The CM accused the PM of hurting the "pride of Kannadigas" by "uttering lies about the state."
 
 "BJP president was involved in murder case, he only speaks lies. Here also they are projecting a CM candidate who has been to jail. PM has hurt pride of Kannadigas by uttering lies about the state," ANI quoted him as saying.
 
 Siddaramaiah also took exception to PM Modi mocking the state's law and order situation, when he said: "World is discussing ease of doing business but here ease of murdering is being discussed."
 
 "How many died during their tenure in Godhra? 2,000 dead. Also, is there any law and order in Haryana? Wherever BJP is in power there is no protection for minorities," the Karnataka CM countered.
 
 Seeking to allay all doubts about his government's performance, Siddaramaiah cited data from the Centre, to show Karnataka's progress from number 11 in investment to 1.
 
 Yesterday, PM Modi had remarked that the Congress was on its way out in Karnataka while addressing a public meeting at Bengaluru's Palace Grounds.
 
 "Karnataka's Congress government has placed the interests of their party above the interests of the state and the people. Corruption and mis-governance are rampant. Every section of society, including farmers, youth, neo-middle class and the middle class are unhappy," he had said.
