CHENNAI: Hours after the state government denied receiving any alert from the Centre on  , the Forest Survey of India, which comes under Union ministry of environment and forests, described it as a “natural reaction.”

 Senior officials of  , headquartered in Dehradun refused to be drawn into the controversy with the state government. 
 
 “Their reaction is natural. If the inquiry committee (led by senior bureaucrat, Atulya Misra) has any clarifications, they can approach us,” was all a senior official could say. 
 
 FSI director-general, Siddhanta Das, said the environment ministry had already made its stance clear in its statement issued late on Sunday — that two alerts were disseminated to the state nodal officer, Tamil Nadu Forest department, on March 11 at 2.29pm and 3.37pm.
 
 The FSI always provides fire alerts to state forest departments through email and SMS to aid in better fire management at the field level. 
 
 The automation of the whole process includes, night-time alerts. The alerts are sent to registered users of the FSI portal. 
 
 When TOI contacted Theni district forest officer, E Rajendran, the officer refused to comment to any queries – If he is a registered user for SMS alert or when did he receive the alert from the nodal officer. “The inquiry is on,” he said. 
 
 A senior official, seeking anonymity said the mobile connectivity could also have hampered the dissemination of message from FSI.
