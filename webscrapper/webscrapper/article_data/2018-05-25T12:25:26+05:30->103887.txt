NASHIK: The motorists on the   had a tough time negotiating the traffic on Monday as the politicians parked their vehicles right outside the collectorate despite the road being marked as a ‘no parking’ zone.

 The politicians, who had come to cast their vote at the employment guarantee scheme deputy collector’s office, had parked their vehicles on the   road, blocking the traffic. Only 160 electors were to cast their votes.
 
 “Despite the fact that ‘no parking’ has been declared along the collectorate, it is beyond our understanding how could these elected representatives claiming to be ‘janata ke sevak’ park their vehicles causing problems to common man,” asked  , a businessman.
 
 All through the day, the sports utility vehicles remained parked on the road and the traffic was forced to crawl through a single lane, as the three-lane road was reduced to two lanes as one lane has been separated by barricades by police to discourage parking of vehicles there.
 
 “The extreme left lane of the road is directly off use. In that case why don’t the city traffic branch officials tow away the vehicles? In April, my car was towed away from same spot despite my requests,” said Rashmi Ahuja, a college student.
 
 “When we seek permission for a road blockade – symbolic one for five minutes – or when we agitate for demands, police use force against us to allow vehicles through or refuse permission for agitation. On Monday, the traffic police were asking motorists to move away instead of forcing the who’s who to move their vehicles,” said  , a member of the Students Federation of India.
 
 Police, however, claimed that they did act against the vehicles parked outside the collectorate. “We had posted our men to ensure the traffic movement was affected minimally. We have even issued challans to a few motorists,” he said.
