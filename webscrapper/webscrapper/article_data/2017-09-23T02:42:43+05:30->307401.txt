NEW DELHI: After Doklam, India and China are moving to reclaim the narrative of the two Asian giants working together for development. 

 Chinese ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui, in a signed piece in 'The Hindu' on Friday, said, "Faced with similar development objectives and common challenges such as 'anti-globalisation' and trade protectionism, China and India should work together. ... We should work towards a... healthy bilateral relationship by focusing on cooperation... and resolving differences. Just like Chinese foreign minister   said, both sides should make sure that relations do not derail.., and make the Himalayan region a new highland for Asia's development."
 
 After the dust settled on Doklam, India's presence at the   summit was intended as an effort to drag bilateral ties back to some semblance of normalcy. Luo's remarks indicate that Beijing is also willing to rebuild the relationship. 
 
 Referring to the conversation between President   and PM   at  , he said, "The meeting was scheduled for half an hour but lasted an hour and 25 minutes. 
 
 This shows that both sides are willing to devote enough time to conducting a comprehensive... exchange of views. President Xi said  's success has increased the affinity of the Chinese for the people of India, while PM Modi also highly praised the great success of 'Where Has the Time Gone', a film named after a speech by President Xi... and... co-produced by artistes BRICS member states."
 
 Xi had referred to 'Dangal' during his meeting with Modi at Astana too. India went through Doklam emphasising the "Astana consensus", which reflected the two sides' feeling that "differences should not become disputes".
