Pune: The   is likely to give green signal to merger of 34 villages in the limits of  . 

 Khadakwasla MLA Bhimrao Tapkir on Wednesday said, “The ministers concerned have in principle approved the merger proposal, which has been in discussion for the last couple of years. Some objections were raised in the past and the matter is in the Bombay  . The court will hear the case on Thursday and the state government will present its stand which is expected to be in favour of the merger.” 
 
 A delegation of MLAs from Pune held a meeting in this regard with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and minister of state for urban development Ranjit Patil in Mumbai on Wednesday.
 
 If the merger plan is approved as per the notification issued earlier by the state urban development department,   would become the largest municipal corporation in the state. Villages in fringe areas of Pune would be brought within the municipal limits.
 
 Tapkir said, “Gram panchayat elections in these villages are on the cards. If they are merged, then the elections will have to be cancelled. A timely decision on the merger is needed as there should be no complications once the elections are held.”
 
 Residents of these villages have urged the state government to decide on the merger issue at the earliest. A delegation of villagers had submitted a memorandum to the state government last year, stating that the merger notification was issued in May 2014, but no action had been taken since then.
 
 Citizens’ group Haveli Taluka Nagari Kruti Samiti had filed a petition in 2014 in the high court to expedite the merger process. “The matter has been pending for a long time as extensions were given a number of times. There is no valid reason for any extension now,” said Shrirang Chavan of the Samiti.
