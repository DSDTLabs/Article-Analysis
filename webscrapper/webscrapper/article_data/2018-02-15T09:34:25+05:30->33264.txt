VADODARA: Nearly 11 years after the   paid crores of rupees to buy a  , it may finally get a refund of the money. 

 The   on Wednesday asked land agent Arvind Jani to deposit Rs 4.11 crore in the local court. The HC was hearing an application filed by Jani against the lower court order of November last year which had asked him to deposit the amount within four months.
 
 “The high court on Wednesday heard both the sides and dismissed Jani’s plea. He has been asked to deposit Rs 4.11 crore before March 6 as was directed by a local court earlier,” said Amul Jikar, treasurer,  . 
 
 “Jani’s request to allow him to deposit the amount in instalments too was rejected. If he doesn’t deposit the amount in time, the court will draw decree against him. This is a major victory for the BCA that had been fighting legal battle to get back the money it paid to Jani for a failed land deal in Sankarda,” Jikar told TOI. 
 
 BCA had paid Jani Rs 4.11 crore to buy a piece of land in Sankarda in 2007 for constructing an international cricket stadium. The deal, however, failed to materialize and BCA has been trying to recover the money along with interest since then. Jani had issued post-dated cheques worth Rs 8.25 crore to BCA towards final settlement in 2013. But the cheques bounced following which BCA filed a separate case in the court. The association later bought a land in Kotambi on Halol Road for building a cricket stadium.
