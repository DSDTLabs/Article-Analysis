GUWAHATI:   Congress Legislature Party   on Monday said the Centre should make arrangements for providing   of those who have died due to   

 "The demonetisation move was made in a hurry and now its effects have hit everyone in the country. More than 100 people lost their lives either standing in queues or failing to get money for their needs. Who will take responsibility of these deaths? We want the government to take steps immediately to compensate the deaths of these innocent people," Saikia said at a press meet at the party headquarters on Monday.
 
 More than 48 lakh workers have lost their jobs in the country, he said, adding that the government should make alternative arrangements soon.
 
 "In Assam, the tea sector and small-time vegetable growers have got a huge blow. In the name of seizing black money, the government is harassing the common people," the CLP leader said.
 
 Though the Narendra Modi government has been insisting on moving towards a cashless economy, the lack of infrastructure to actually put this into effect is what is making people suffer, he said.
 
 "We haven't seen any such infrastructure. Besides, we have seen that across the world many developed countries have not been able to do it successfully either. So, it does not seem to be very practical," Saikia said.
