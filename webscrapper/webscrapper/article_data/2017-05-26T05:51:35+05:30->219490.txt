THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   will take up the matter of releasing Fr Tom Uzhunnalil, who has been held captive by terror outfit  , with Prime Minister   in an upcoming meeting.

 Replying to a submission by   (Mani) leader and former finance minister K M Mani in this regard, the chief minister informed the assembly that he would take up the matter with the Prime Minister in person, as the communication with the Centre through letters did not yield any result so far.
 
 The chief minister noted that the state had apprised the Centre on April 25, 2016 and February 27, 2017, but there was no reply. The chief minister had also written to the Prime Minister on March 14.
 
 Uzhunnalil, a priest who hails from Bharananganam in Pala, was abducted by Islamic State militants from Aden Port in Yemen on March 4, 2016.
 
 The chief minister said that the place where he has been held under captivity has not been traced yet and since it concerns international relations, the state could not intervene beyond a limit. 
 
 The matter could be resolved only through the Indian embassy and the ministry of external affairs.
 
 Opposition leader   also said that there was no point in repeatedly writing to the Centre and the matter should be taken up seriously.
