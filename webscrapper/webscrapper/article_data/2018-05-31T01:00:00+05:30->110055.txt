GAYA: The much- awaited CISF cover continues to elude the world heritage site Mahabodhi Mahavihara at Bodh Gaya even after nearly eight years of serial blasts at the shrine, in which five accused were convicted by an NIA court on Friday.

 The CISF cover was promised by the then Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in 2013 soon after the terrorist attack on the shrine. Later, a CISF team led by a DIG rank officer visited the site for inspection around two years ago and identified the points for setting up watch towers and other facilities needed. But nothing has been heard since then. The issue was also raised during the recent visit of DGP KS Dwivedi around a month ago.
 
 Though officials are reluctant to go on record, sources said that the maintenance cost is the major issue and Rs 18-20 crore per annum is required as establishment cost to host about 150 CISF personnel of various ranks. Sources also added that the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) was initially supposed to bear the expenses but sources claimed that it has cited lack of required financial expenses for the same.
 
 Sources said the state government had also requested the Union home ministry to provide CISF security free of cost but the request was reportedly turned down. The state government to has not shown much interest in bearing the expenses. Meanwhile, the need for CISF security cover was once again felt following the blast and recovery of unexploded explosives on January 19 last during the visit of Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
 
 Asked about the CISF cover, BTMC secretary Nangzey Dorjee said it was for the state government to take a call in the matter. “BMP, which, at present guards the shrine is doing a good job,” he said. Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said a decision in this regard is taken by even higher authorities and adequate security was being provided to the shrine at the present.
