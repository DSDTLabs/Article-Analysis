Singer-composer   is set to start a new chapter in his life. The ' ' singer will tie the knot with  , a Kanpur-based mechanical engineer, on February 23. The wedding, an intimate affair, will be held in his hometown, Kanpur. The couple will exchange rings on February 20 and a reception will be held on the 26th. 

 Ankit tells us, “It’s an arranged match. Pallavi and I were introduced to each other by our parents around a month ago. I liked her simplicity and the way she bonded with my parents, especially with my father. She is his choice. Pallavi is an educated girl with high family values. I am from a middle-class family and I wanted a partner jo parivaar ko saath lekar chale.”
 
 Pallavi is also a fan of Ankit’s music and her favourite composition of his is 'Galliyan' (' '). Does she also like to sing? “Usko gaana gaane ka shauq hai. There will be music sessions during all the rituals and don’t be surprised if I sing her favourite number,” he replies.
 
 Ankit, who was accused of rape in 2013 and   last year, says Pallavi has no hang-ups about his past. “We met before the marriage was finalised and I discussed everything with her. Her parents were also made aware of everything right from the start. Ab zamaana bahut aage badh chuka hai. Aaj bhi log discussion kar sakte hain, I can’t stop them. What’s important is ki jiske saath mein judne wala hoon, nothing is hidden from her and her family. I didn’t need to justify myself to her,” he says.
 
 A get-together with industry friends will be held in Mumbai later. Here’s wishing the soon-to-wed couple all the very best for a melodious beginning.
