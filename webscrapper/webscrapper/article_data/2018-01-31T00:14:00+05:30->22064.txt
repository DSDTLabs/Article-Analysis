Chandigarh: Property tax notices to people who have already paid up, dirty public toilets, nonfunctional street lights, and installation of signages in residential areas were some crucial issues discussed during the monthly house meeting of Chandigarh MC on Monday.

 Most councillors raised the issue of property tax, saying the civic body had no record of who had paid the levy for residential properties. They cited this as a reason behind the MC issuing property tax notices to people who have already paid up. Congress councillor Ravinder Kaur even brought a receipt of the tax paid by her father-in-law and showed it to the house. “He still got a notice,” she said.
 
 Municipal commissioner Jitender Yadav admitted to the MC not keeping a record in the past. “Therefore, now we have changed the format of the notice by writing that those who have paid need not worry. They just have to show the payment receipt,” he said, adding that a company had been hired for digitising property tax data and the job would be completed by the end of May. “No such problem will emerge after that,” he said.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Anil Kumar Garg said there were around 1.2 lakh residential properties in the city falling under the tax ambit, but only around 30,000 people were paying the tax. As no record was maintained first, notices were being issued to everyone. We request people who have already paid the tax to just show the slips to us; we will treat them as paid tax,” he said.
 
 Municipal councilors also raised the issue of poor sanitation in public toilets and non-functional street lights. Nominated councillor Charanjeev Singh said the MC should hire contractors at the earlier to maintain public toilets. BJP councillor Vinod Aggarwal said most streetlights of his area were not functional. His party counterpart, Heera Negi, said the timings of public toilets should be extended.
