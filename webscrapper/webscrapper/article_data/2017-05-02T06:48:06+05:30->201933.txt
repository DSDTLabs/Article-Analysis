NAGPUR: Affirming its commitment to the cause of women empowerment, The Institute of Indian   ( ), Nagpur Chapter, elected   as its first chairperson on Saturday at a city hotel.

 “I’m the only woman on the board. Therefore, being accepted by my fellow-board members is the major challenge for me,” Sharma said in her acceptance speech.
 
 Sharma said that generally students did not prefer working in foundries. It is a crude industry and it does not offer white collar jobs. “I will visit prominent engineering colleges in the city and engage students with IIF activities. I’m sure it will attract young talent,” she said.
 
 Rannveig Johannsdottir, a visiting industrial expert from Iceland and the guest of honour, said that there was scarcity of women in industrial sectors across Europe. “It is not just a phenomenon specific to India. I’m glad that the scenario is changing rapidly and more women are pursuing higher education in universities.” 
 
 Master of ceremony Poonam Raman said that Sharma should be accepted as she had worked her way up the ladder from the post of a council member. “She has the potential to take the Nagpur chapter to newer heights,” she said.
 
 Srinivasan Iyer, managing director of  , was the chief guest.
 
 The Institute of Indian Foundrymen is affiliated to World Foundrymen Association and has 26 chapters across India. The chapters are divided into four regions; North, South, East and West. Nagpur Chapter is a part of the western chapter, including Maharashtra, Gujarat,   and Madhya Pradesh.
