MUMBAI: The anti-extortion cell of the crime branch has arrested three suspected members of the   gang who allegedly fired at an   wine shop and a   beer bar recently and left “extortion notes“ for the staff.

 Crime branch DCP   said Raj Chauhan (25), Ali Khan (27) and their handler   (52) were on Friday nabbed from Kurla, when they came there for a meeting to share among themselves the money earned through crime. Sawant said they had recei ved a tip-off about the meeting, after which a police team laid a trap for the gang members. The trio has been booked under the Arms Act.
 
 “The gang had fired at a wine shop at Ulhasnagar on April 27 for extortion. On May 7, when the gang targeted a beer bar in Nalasopara, a bullet hit the cashier in the chest. He is undergoing treatment,“ said Sawant. A police source said that in the Ulhasnagar wine shop incident, the gang had instructed the shooter to fire at a staffer's chest, but the bullet hit a bottle creating panic among the people present there.
 
 A police source said that opening fire, the gang would leave a chit, with the name 'Suresh Pujari' written on it. “It was like a threat message for extortion,“ said Vinayak Vast, the police officer who headed the team to nab the trio. According to police, the gang resorted to this extortion tactic as the shopbar owners did not answer several phone calls made by Pujari.
 
 The police have recovered a 7.65 bore pistol, two magazines, eight live cartridges, Rs 2.5 lakh and two motor bikes. “While Khan would ride the bike, Chauhan would open fire and throw a note at the victim.We are probing the source of fire arms and who their next target. Their interrogation will also help us to get details about Pujari,“ added an officer.
