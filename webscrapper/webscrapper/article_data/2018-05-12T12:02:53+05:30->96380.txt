VADODARA: The   – better known as   – is a picturesque sight when it is filled with water. But this year has been one of the few exceptions when one can see large expanse of dry land that is actually the bed of the reservoir.

 The reservoir has reached its lowest level in the last decade. The previous lowest level was in the year 2011 when the level in the reservoir was reported at 204.70 feet. On Friday, it was 204.4 feet and it may continue to dry up consistently if the water supply from   branch canal is not increased to around 60 cusecs from the present 20 cusecs. From 148 million litres per day (MLD), Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been forced to draw only 132 MLD.
 
 VMC officials pointed out that the civic body had written to   (SSNNL) a couple of days ago seeking more water. “The officials have said they would discuss the matter with their higher-ups and get back to us,” said an official.
 
 Civic body sources said VMC had also agreed to give Rs1.36 crore to SSNNL towards deposit for water supply. A cheque has been kept ready by the civic body and will be dispatched soon. There is no clarity yet if SSNNL will bill VMC for the water. The deposit has been sought at a rate of Rs3.14 per kilolitre.
 
 ‘Illegal connections from Ajwa pipelines’
 
  Ruling BJP corporator   has shot off a letter to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) administration to take strict action against theft of water from the main feeder lines supplying Ajwa waters to the city through Nimeta filtration plant.   stated that these lines had been severed last year, but the connections have been made again.
