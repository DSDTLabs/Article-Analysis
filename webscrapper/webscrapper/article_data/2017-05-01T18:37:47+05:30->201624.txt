The Chainsmokers treated high school students with a surprise as the musical duo performed for them before their concert in Chicago. The EDM-pop duo, which consists of   and  , took to Twitter to share the picture from the prom. 

  
  
 "Crashed this prom right now. It was across the street from our arena show, so why not," they captioned the photo. 
 In a 10-minute performance at Huntley, the two sang their one of the biggest hits from this year- 'Closer' 
 
 While it was a surprise to most participants, the Chainsmokers' prom appearance was actually planned, with the help of school principal Scott Rowe. 
 
 "They just kind of came from backstage and just started performing 'Closer.' The kids weren't exactly sure what was going on. About three words in, somebody screamed 'That's The Chainsmokers!' and they just bum-rushed the stage. 
 
 "It says a lot about those guys and how cool they are to their fans. It was probably the toughest secret I've ever kept, because I knew the kids were going to go crazy for it," Rowe said.
