VADODARA: The busy road from Mandvi to Panigate in the walled city will remain closed for over two weeks from Saturday. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) is planning to conduct various civic works on the stretch during the period.

 According to VMC sources, the road will be closed for laying drainage lines and widening it. The civic body had recently conducted a major razing drive there to clear the road line. The civic body is expected to complete the work by March 11.
 
 The VMC had razed the structures in the road line between Mandvi and Panigate over a week back. But the top brass of the civic body had instructed its engineers to ensure that all work related to drainage, water and other service lines was completed before the road was laid. Similar instructions were also given to Vadodara Gas Limited (VGL) the joint venture company formed by the VMC and GAIL Gas Ltd.
 
 Sources said that the work on replacing the old drainage line on the stretch will be completed first and then the work on the road will begin. Citizens have been asked to use the   leading to Gendigate or the   leading to   as alternatives. This, however, may lead to some congestion on the narrow roads.
