 Joshi, who was seen in ' ' and ' ', has some exciting projects lined up. The details, he says, will be revealed at the appropriate time. Sharman is often asked why he chose to be a part of erotic thrillers. He attributes the decision to a need “to break perceptions and the monotony of roles”. “Many of my friends and family members were against me taking up such roles, but I was adamant on breaking the boy-next-door image, which had been created by my previous roles,” he says. However, the actor admits that it was a calculated risk. He explains, “I knew that the odds were high, but thankfully, 'Hate Story 3' was very well received and I could break away from the shackles of monotony. After it paid off well, I decided not to be a part of any erotica.” 

 What about 'Wajah Tum Ho'? Sharman says, “In that film, I did not have any part in the erotica aspect; my character was that of an upright cop, a role I had never played before. Post that movie, I am being offered many exciting roles, which I longed for in the past.” 
 
 The actor, who is in no hurry to elaborate on his new projects, sums it up saying, “As a medium, television is growing and my interest in it has also increased. Yes, I am open to doing TV.”
