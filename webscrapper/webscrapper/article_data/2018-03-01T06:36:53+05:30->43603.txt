AHMEDABAD: The Centre for   (CEE) has once again organized its awareness campaign known as 'Safe Holi Festival' across schools and colleges in the city. As part of the programme, experts from CEE are not only spreading the message to conserve natural resources - water and fuel wood - but also to play Holi safely. 

 "The campaign will speak about 'Tilak Holi' and 'Community  ' to help reduce the consumption of water and fuel wood," said  , the coordinator for the project.
 
 CEE volunteers have also made an effort to teach students to make eco-friendly and natural colours. "In addition to encouraging people to conserve natural resources, we are also sensitizing them to respect and protect stray animals and pets," said Deep Shah, the project officer. "It is harmful to throw colours on animals."
 
 The CEE has roped in students from several schools and colleges for the project. These institutions include St Kabir, Zydus School for Excellence, Mahatma Gandhi International School, GLS University, and KS School of Business Management.
