Chandigarh: On the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, an FIR has been registered against the registrar (recruitment) of high court at Sector 3 police station in Chandigarh in connection with the leak of premlinary examination for the recruitment of judicial officers in Haryana. Along with registrar Balwinder Kumar Sharma, police also booked two candidates in the case on Tuesday late night.

 The FIR names registrar Sharma, Sunita, a resident of Najafgarh in Delhi and Sushila, resident of Sector 5, Panchkula. No arrests have been made in the case so far. A special investigation team (SIT) headed by superintendent of police (crime and investigation) Ravi Kumar is probing into the matter.
 
 The recruitment committee of the high court had recommended an FIR against the registrar in the case. It was found that both Sunita (general category) and Sushila (reserved category) were topping the examination with exceptionally high marks in their respective categories. An internal probe by the HC has already found Sharma responsible for paper leak to Sunita. The probe panel had recommended registration of FIR in the case.
 
 Sources, however, confirmed that Sharma had cried foul during an internal probe of the high court administration and claimed that “he has been made a scapegoat to save someone else in the whole scam”.
