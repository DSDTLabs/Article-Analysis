BHOPAL: If the Commonwealth Games medals show the highs of women in Indian sports, the three-day trials of under-19 MP girls'   team, currently on in MP's  , is the pits. Players were given Deendayal Thali meals, worth Rs 5 each, on Monday, and even potable water was too much to ask for in 40-degree heat.

 Young players gathered for the three-day selection from all over the state on Sunday to vie for a place in the national tourney, but are appalled by the lack of facilities. All they could get was subsidized meals meant for the marginalized class under the popular MP government scheme, 'Deendayal Thali'.
 
 "This government felicitates sportspersons after their achievement, but cares little about providing them basic infrastructure. We don't even get good drinking water," said an athlete on Monday.
 
 
 
 
 The petition, filed through advocate  , refers to a report published on state finance department's website that the average per capita debt burden on every citizen of MP is Rs 13,853. The state cannot afford to pay extra allowance to these saints, he says. Verma also points out that Computer Baba and   had announced a campaign against the government. They were included in a Narmada conservation committee and given MoS status a day before the scheduled launch of the campaign. Giving them MoS privileges ahead of assembly polls is "appalling", the petitioner alleges, praying before the court to set aside the notification and call it ultra vires. If the state government insists on granting MoS status to sadhus, it should halt all pecuniary perks, the petition says.
