LUCKNOW:   government has promised to look into the cases filed against   in Western UP during and after   riots. A delegation of various   khaps met CM Yogi Adityanath along with Muzaffarnagar MP and former Union minister Sanjeev Balyan, who is also from Balyan khap and MLA Umesh Malik from Malik khap and demanded scrapping of the cases against them. 

 They demanded that cases slapped on women and children should be withdrawn. Sanjeev Baliyan told TOI that they are not seeking any reprieve in cases during Muzaffarnagar riots but only in those filed after riots. Sources said that most cases were lodged against villagers who had allegedly stopped police from making arrests. The women and children have been running to courts since over four years and hence cases against them should be withdrawn. 
 
 The khaps demanded that the 402 cases of arson were also motivated and should be scrapped or looked into again. Jats alleged that cases were slapped on them under political pressure to ensure that benefits reached the other community. Baliyan said that most of cases were fabricated and hence they should be withdrawn or another investigation should be ordered. The CM told the khaps that their demands would be sent to legal experts for their opinion. 
 
 The Baliyan khap was represented by chief Chaudhary Naresh Tikait, Malik khap by Chaudhary Rajendra Malik, son of Harkishan Malik, and Ahlawat khap by Chaudhary Gajendra Ahlawat. Jat Sabha office-bearers Chaudhary Pratap Chaudhary of Shamli, Devendra Singh of Muzaffarnagar and   and Akhil Bharatiya Jat Mahasabha secretary   was also in the delegation.
