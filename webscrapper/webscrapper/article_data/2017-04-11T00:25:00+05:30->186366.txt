Indore: Former secretary of Indore Krishi Upaj Mandi, Lalit Dahima, who is accused of evading taxes of Rs 8 crore 15 years ago, appeared before a local court here on Monday to apply for   after a challan against him was presented before the court on April 6.

 A bailable warrant was also issued against him on the same date for not appearing before the court despite being served notices.
 
 Currently posted in Bhopal as deputy secretary (prisons), Lalit Dahima surrendered before the court in the morning and moved his bail application before the court of first additional district and sessions judge JP Singh.
 
 “Dahima moved the bail plea on grounds that a departmental enquiry had already been conducted against him and was given a clean chit in the probe. He also said that being a government employee, it was unlikely he would escape, and hence he must be granted bail,” Ashlesh Sharma, special public prosecutor representing the economic offences wing (EOW), told TOI.
 
 The controversy dates back to 2002, when 23 private firms doing business in Indore Krishi Upaj Mandi were found to have evaded tax worth Rs 8 crore in collusion with mandi employees and officials. Acting on a complaint by the state government's general administration department (GAD), the bureau had booked the accused for cheating and fraud two years later.
 
 With Dahima’s challan, the total number of accused persons in the scam has now gone up to 29, including private traders, mandi officials and employees. The EOW had produced a charge sheet in the case against the accused traders on December 28, 2011 and against accused mandi employees on Feburary 27, 2015 after prosecution sanction was obtained for them.
 
 “Challan against Dahima could not be produced along with the others as permission for prosecuting him was delayed in bureaucratic hurdles. Charges will be decided against all the accused at the next hearing on April 20,” Sharma added.
