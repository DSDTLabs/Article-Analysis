IMPHAL: Stunning the newly installed N   government, the Churchandpur-based joint action committee (JAC) against anti-tribal bills has demanded the conversion of Lamka into a full-fledged district. Lamka covers the whole Churachandpur district headquarters and its surrounding areas. 

 Reacting to the demand, which had been unforeseen, Biren Singh on Thursday said his government is not in a position to comply with the demand for the time being.
 
 Addressing the inauguration of a   (PMKVY) Training Centre at Thangmeiband here on Thursday, Biren nevertheless said the demand can possibly be met after the district boundary commission submits its report to the government. PMKVY is a flagship programme of the Union ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship and its objective is to enable a large number of youths to take up industry-relevant skill training that will help them in securing a better livelihood.
 
 The third round of talks between the JAC and the state government on Wednesday had ended in a deadlock.
 
 Eight bodies of tribal agitators are lying unclaimed at Churachandpur district hospital since they were killed in a violent protest against the passing of three anti-migrant bills by the state assembly on August 31, 2015.
 
 Governor   has already appealed to the tribal pressure group to allow religious burials of the bodies of the eight protesters.
 
 Notably, Pherzawl, one of the new seven districts created by the previous   government on December 8 last year, was carved out of the Churachandpur district.
 
 At the same event, the chief minister said the state has more than 7 lakh unemployed youths, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a dream to provide employment to every Indian and the state cabinet has decided to operationalize the   under the labour and employment department.
