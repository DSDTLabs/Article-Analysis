AHMEDABAD: In an important  ,   on Tuesday ruled that a   in a   can file an appeal before a sessions court if the accused persons are acquitted by a magisterial court.

 The incident in this case involved one Lavjibhai Bhalodiya, who filed a complaint with Viramgam police against eight persons for assault, extortion and criminal conspiracy. All eight persons were acquitted by a magisterial court. Bhalodiya filed an appeal before a sessions court at the Ahmedabad rural court campus. The sessions court asked him to file the appeal before the high court and said that an appeal against acquittal by the original complainant is not maintainable before a sessions court.
 
 Justice J B Pardiwala quashed the decision and remanded the matter back to the sessions court. The HC said that a victim in a police case may file an appeal before a sessions court against an acquittal order under provision of section 372 of the CrPC. “In the event the victim prefers an appeal to the court of sessions in terms of the proviso to section 372 of the CrPC, no leave is required to be granted by the high court in terms of subsection (3) of Section 378 of the CrPC as amended by Act 25 of 2005 which restricts such leave only to appeals preferred before the high court and not before any other forum,” the court order reads.
 
 The HC also clarified that an appeal against an order of acquittal would lie at the instance of the complainant before the high court upon seeking leave under section 378(4) of the CrPC provided the case is one instituted upon a complaint.
