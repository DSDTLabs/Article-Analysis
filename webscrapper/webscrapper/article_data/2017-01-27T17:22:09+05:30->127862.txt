Sanal Kumar Sasidharan's   recently made news when it found a place in the competition section of the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR). 

  who plays the hero in the movie, however, dismisses claims of it having a lead actor. 'There is no hero or heroine in this movie. The whole film happens inside a truck, and revolves around the six people inside it.' Kannan, who is a theatre artiste, was spotted by State Award-winning director Sanal Kumar after watching one of his plays. 'I was supposed to be part of his Ozhivudivasathe Kali but wasn't able to. I consider it a loss but I guess I'm destined to do a film of Sanal.'
 
  Sexy Durga is not a movie which can be compared with any other film, says Kannan. 'The initial idea of the film was quite different. There was just a one liner when we began the shoot, no prescribed script. And that one liner too changed as the shoot progressed. Each day we would review what we shot and think about what to shoot the next day. My character Kabeer too was moulded on the way. But Sanal had very clear instructions to give us and it is a director's movie in that sense.'
 
 Shooting inside the small space of a truck was no easy matter either, adds Kannan. 'We couldn't speak loud and it was all about underplay. We used sync sound as well, my first experience with it.'
 
 Kannan has acted in around 85 plays, 30 odd short films, and in films such as Chocolate and Pattam Pole. 'Acting is my passion and profession and it doesn't matter to me what the medium is or the genre of a film. I'm lucky to have got such a big character in Sanal's film,' he says.
