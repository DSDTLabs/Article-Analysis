NEW DELHI: The prospects of the merged faction of EK Palanisamy and OP Panneerselvam have grown stronger in the symbol contest as the claim of the faction led by   lost steam, following the exodus of 18 MLAs.

 Of the three different groups staking claim to AIADMK’s poll symbol — Palansami-Panneerselvam, T T V Dinakaran and a third led by late AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa’s niece   Peravai — only the first has submitted affidavits of party workers supporting it, sources in   said. 
 
 While Dhinakaran’s plea has become almost infructuous, Deepa’s plea also stands on a weak wicket as it is not supported by any affidavits from party MLAs or workers, noted a Commission official. 
 
 Sources said the October 6 hearing is being held by   to determine if rival groups led by   and Deepa have any evidence of majority support they claim to command among party workers, so as to enable the poll panel to decide if there is indeed a valid dispute over AIADMK’s “poll symbol”.
 
 Unless they are able to turn up substantial evidence, the symbol may go to the merged factions currently in office.
 
 In case either of the two factions are unable to produce any affidavits, it will only strengthen the claim of the united AIADMK group of Palanisami-Panneerselvam to the poll symbol. “In the absence of any concrete proof of support with Dhinakaran or Deepa to dispute the united AIADMK’s claim based on almost 10 lakh affidavits, there is a strong case for EC to recognise the latter as the real party and restore to it the “two leaves” symbol after defreezing the same,” said a source.
