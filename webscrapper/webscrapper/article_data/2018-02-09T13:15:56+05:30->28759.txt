MADURAI: The shopkeepers who had their shops inside the   temple, a section of whom have been asked to vacate the temple, have demanded that their livelihood be protected.

 The members of the   temple shopkeepers association met Madurai district collector   and submitted a petition on Thursday. Stating that they were facing heavy losses in the past one week, they demanded that if they are made to vacate the temple, they must be given an alternative place. 
 
 They said that have had these shops for five generations and it was during former chief minister Kamarajarâ€™s period that they were given permission by the government to run the shops. The rent for the shops has increased 160 per cent by the temple and they had even paid those dues, but now we are being blamed for it, they said.
 
 The collector has assured them that he would look into the issue. TNN
