 has always voiced her opinions on a variety of issues and has successfully leveraged her   fame to champion causes. And the actor is playing a character true to her real self in National Award winning director Sanjoy Nag's film 'Good Morning Sunshine'. The film also stars noted actors like Revathy,  , Shweta Tripathi and Tejaswini Kolhapure, among others. Though the film explores the relationship bond the women form, the underlying theme of Swachh Bharat comes alive in it in an engaging way too. 

  The actor, who plays a pivotal role in the film, shot portions of it at a tiny village near Varanasi, which is also close to her ancestral village Mijwan. According to her, the film has prioritized issues of open defecation, sanitation and construction of toilets and brought them to the centre stage. She has worked in the slums of Mumbai and  , her native village, and has seen lack of toilets in both the places, and has personally tried to ensure that toilets were constructed in her village through her MPLADS (Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme) fund as a member of parliament.
 
  Says Shabana, "When director Sanjoy Nag narrated the film’s theme and my cameo in it, I realised that my dialogues were more or less what I would say in reality. Girls are dropping out of school, women are forced to get up and go to the fields where they are subjected to rape, kidnapping and such heinous crimes. And this is where the strengthening of the panchayat comes into play, something which Gandhi advocated, but we still haven’t achieved it."
