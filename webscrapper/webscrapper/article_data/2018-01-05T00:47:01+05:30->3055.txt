Coimbatore: Chaos reigned at bus stations here on Thursday night as passengers, including women and children, were stuck after the employees of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation launched a strike. People, who visited the bus stations hoping to travel to outstation destinations as well as within the city were left high and dry as the buses came to a sudden halt around 9pm after trade unions called for the strike. While many passengers, who had intended for overnight journey to other cities returned home disappointed cancelling their plans, several passengers were seen struggling to get buses even to travel within the city. At Singanallur bus stand, from where buses head to Trichy, Madurai and other southern districts, there were several clueless passengers caught unawares. At Ukkadam and Gandhipuram too, there were a number of disappointed passengers struggling to find ways to travel. Trade union leaders said around 12,000 employees in the Coimbatore division comprising Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur and Nilgiris, joined the strike. In city, as many as 1,200 buses stopped plying while in the division, 6,000 buses came to a halt. “We had informed the government that we will strike work if our demands were not met. So, you can’t blame us for striking without prior announcement,’ said Abdul Rasheed, a trade union leader.
