 Pimpri Chinchwad mayor Nitin Kalje said, “Senior actors   and Rishi Kapoor will inaugurate the festival at   cinema, Chinchwad at 6.30pm. Singers   and Komal will regale the audience before the inauguration.”
 
 “It is a great opportunity for residents of Pimpri Chinchwad to watch so many films at two venues in the city. The festival is being held for many years in Pune so there is better public response there. With better publicity and audience response, we may be able to have a separate film festival too,” added municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar.
