JAIPUR:   (JMC) headquarters is one   where protest never ends.   councillors Tuesday started staging a dharna for indefinite period demanding   and proper sanitation in the city.

 The councillors alleged that new mayor Ashok Lahoti is partial and not allocating funds to carry out development works in their wards. 
 
 Soon after, the dharna turned politically as deputy mayor and four other BJP councillors came in defense of Lahoti. Deputy mayor announced to show the work done in each ward in public. He alleged that Congress councillors are befooling voters by diverting their mind and producing wrong facts. 
 
 However, remaining BJP councillors stayed mum and agreed with the demand of Congress councillors behind the curtains. Many alleged that BJP government has replaced city mayor, but problem of councillors remain same and there is no improvement in the city’s condition. 
 
 Congress councillor announced mayor does not give a proper planning to improve sanitation and infrastructure conditions in city and the dharna would continue. The protesters reached headquaters with quilts and mattress Tuesday. Dharam Singhaniya, a congress councillor said , “The contractors have stopped working in the city in absence of payment. Condition of streetlights and sanitation is already in poor state. We would not call off the protest till proper planning is chalked out to improve the conditions.”
 
 Congress councillors further alleged that city mayor did not give them opportunity to raise issues in general body meeting (GBM). “After appointment, Lahoti asked for two- month time from the councillors. He said if councillors support him, there would be change in their wards. However, nothing has been done so far,” added Singhaniya ,
 
 Congress councillors planned to stage a dharna after a recent meeting with district   (DCC) president Pratap Singh Khachariyawas. According to sources, the president pulled councillors for weak opposition.
