LUCKNOW: A   ordered to mark completion of one year of Yogi government failed to reflect on the ground, with heaps of garbage and littered public toilets greeting the residents during the period. The state’s urban development minister had issued the orders for the drive from March 17 to 19, also laying emphasis on PM’s Swachh Bharat Mission.

 While officials of   (LMC) claim they were able to inspect only zones 5 & 8 on Sunday, other directions like sensitizing people and spreading awareness were also not followed. Corporators complained that even on regular days, LMC staff is active only where the minister is expected to visit.
 
 
 Ismailganj I’s corporator   said, “I have been repeatedly writing to the mayor about garbage mess of my ward but no action has been taken. LMC’s sanitary staff only cleans areas where the minister announces to visit. When the mayor was appointed, she had promised she would pay equal attention to all wards, but this was never followed.”
 
 The order states that all municipal bodies of the state will have to ensure cleanliness at public toilets. The order also says that meetings be conducted in all wards regarding garbage collection and disposal and that the municipal team should organize nukkad nataks, rallies, essay and painting competitions in schools, meetings with RWAs to sensitize people about keeping their surroundings clean, but none of this was done in the city. The LMC sanitation officer said, “We could clean only zones 5 and 8. We didn’t have information about organizing other activities, so we only concentrated on sweeping the streets.”
