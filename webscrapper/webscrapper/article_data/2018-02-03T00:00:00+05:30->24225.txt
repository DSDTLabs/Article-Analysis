The five scariest words in cinema are almost always ‘Based on a true story’. The familiar disclaimer is what sets Srijit Mukherji’s next,  , free from the shackles of an ‘inspired story’ tag. The latest buzz in T-town is that the story of Uma, slated for a summer 2018 release, has uncanny similarities with 2010 American TV movie November Christmas, based on a short story written by Greg Coppa. The film is about a terminally ill eight-year-old. Fearing the worst, the father wants to give his daughter an early   and Christmas in case she does not make it through to the end of the year. Uma, on the other hand, centres around a young girl who is fighting a terminal disease. She dreams of organising a Durga Puja at her house and her father works hard to make it happen. Sounds similar, right? Srijit, however, denies having ever heard of November Christmas. He says, his film is based on a true story, records of which the internet and reams of newspapers are flooded with. 

 When we got in touch with the director, he said, “Uma is inspired by the remarkable story about a boy named   and the people of St George in Ontario, Canada, who came together to celebrate an early Christmas for the boy because doctors feared he might not make it until December. I sought the permission of Evan’s mother,  , before dedicating this film to Evan and the people of St George. I don’t have the faintest idea about November Christmas. I haven’t read or watched it. I read about Evan and the extraordinary acts of humanity by the people of St George in 2015 and immediately adapted it for the Indian context.”
 
 Refuting any possible connection between the two films, Srijit further added, “A disclaimer in the film says that it’s inspired by a true story and is a tribute to the people of St George. I have invited Nicole for the premiere already and a fundraiser screening will also be put together, the proceeds of which will go towards the NGO that Nicole is associated with.”
