CHENNAI: Two days after Usha of Trichy died when her husband's bike was kicked by a traffic cop, and a day after a Class VII student died while footboard travelling on an MTC bus, the   said there was no point in merely blaming police officials for everything. "Public and people should be self-disciplined and they should also realise their responsibilities," said the first bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   on Friday. 

  The remarks came after advocate R Y   brought to the notice of the bench that   died after falling from an MTC route 56-C bus which was on its way to Tiruvottriyur. Government pleader T N Rajagopalan told the bench that as per news reports the bus was not crowded and yet the boy was footboard travelling on the bus. The unfortunate incident may have occurred due to footboard travelling, he said. 
 
  It was at this juncture that the bench referred to the Trichy incident in which Usha, riding pillion with her husband, died because of police interception. Though traffic cop concerned had been arrested and the government granted 7 lakh compensation to the victim's kin, there was another version that Usha's husband did not wear helmet, nor did he stop the vehicle when signalled by police, it observed. It was when the man sped past police, did the latter chased them. The unfortunate incident happened then. "When there is a rule that the rider of two-wheelers should wear helmet that should be obeyed by the public," the bench said, adding that there was no question of merely blaming the police officials. The public should also realise their responsibility and it should have self-discipline, the bench said. TNN
