He was born in Belagavi, raised in   and returned to   for college. Currently a student of a film institute run by filmmaker   in Mumbai,   and his team of eight other students — all in their early 20s — have readied a short film, titled  , that deals with the stereotypes that women face. What is unique is that Samarth not only crowdfunded his project, but took money only from men. “We wanted to hit at the root cause. This is a movie about women, but the money collected to make it — Rs 2.3 lakh — was crowdsourced from men, and only men,” says writer-director Samarth, who was inspired by Pawan Kumar’s 2013 crowdfunded film, Lucia.

 Although the movie is only seven-and-a-half minutes long, it took the team eight months to complete it. To ensure that it reaches a wider audience, the team wanted to cast popular faces in the movie, which they have managed to do with actors   and  .
 
  
  
 Speaking about the idea behind the film, Samarth says, “I had the story of Kaash in my mind and was motivated to go to Mumbai and do something about it.” A production house liked his script, but they couldn’t come on board immediately. That is when Samarth decided to take matters into his own hands.
 
 “Everyone from an autowallah to a paanwallah has contributed anything from Rs 10 to Rs 10,000 to this film. I was in a cab once and told the driver about the movie. He has a daughter, because of which he refused to take the fare and asked me to use the money for the movie instead. There is a misconception that uneducated people don’t support gender equality; we have shown that that is not the case,” says the writer-director.
 
 A total of 241 men from across the country have contributed to this movie. The makers are looking at launching Kaash by the end of the month or in the first week of March.
