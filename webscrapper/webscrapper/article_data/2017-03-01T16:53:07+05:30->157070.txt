After eight long years, Kolkata had the rare opportunity to host a cruise liner for two days. The luxury ship, which reached Kolkata from  's Phuket via Bangladesh, returned along the same route on Monday evening. With more than 120 passengers and 99 crew members on board, MV Silver Discoverer, a 103m-long yacht cruise ship, anchored at the Kidderpore docks. The ship travels along the mangroves in   and visits various heritage sites in Myanmar. The voyagers also get assistance from biologists, ornithologists and historians during the trip.
