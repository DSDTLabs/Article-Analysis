INDORE: The six-lane bridge at   may finally see the light of the day, almost 20 years after proposal for its construction was first approved by  . 

 The civic body recently completed survey work for this project and will soon dismantle the 70-year-old bridge in the area to pave way for construction of 30 meter wide bridge.
 
 “We have started foundation work for construction of this bridge. We hope to complete it within a year,” head of IMC’s public works department, Shankar   said.
 
 He said that to ensure timely completion of the project,   had fixed deadline for each work. “While dismantling of existing bridge and foundation work will be completed within two months, construction work will be completed before March, 2019,” he said.
 
 Yadav said that the new bridge will have six lanes. “The width of existing bridge is just six meters, which results in traffic jams. Though its structure is still strong, it lacks proper barricading alongside the road,” he said. The sanctioned cost of the project is around Rs15 crore.
 
 The first ground breaking ceremony for the project had been performed way back in 1997, while the second one was performed in 2000. And after that, the project never really took off. Residents of the surrounding areas claimed that several factors like encroachments and change in political leadership affected the execution of the project. Now, it is seeing some progress as IMC has starting digging work for construction of pillars.
