 A bench headed by acting NGT chairperson Justice Jawad Rahim issued a show-cause notice to DUSIB and sought its reply before May 14 on a plea filed by the traders’ body. The tribunal also questioned why no action should be taken against its officials.
 
 The directions came after the advocate appearing for the body sought the execution of NGT’s previous order, which had directed DUSIB to hand over a 5,000 square metre plot of land in Lajpat Nagar’s Kasturba Niketan for a temporary parking site. The advocate said that despite filing an affidavit in NGT, DUSIB had not handed over the land till date and sought action against the officers concerned in the case.
 
 “Despite numerous letters and representations, DUSIB has not taken any action, which led the traders to file the petition, seeking directions to the board to earmark the plot and comply with the NGT’s 2015 direction,” the plea filed recently said. TNN
