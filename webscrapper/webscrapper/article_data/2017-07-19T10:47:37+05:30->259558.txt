PANAJI: The   (AIFF) has told agitating clubs that the foreign player rule for under-13 and under-15 leagues is restricted to players whose parents reside in India.

 The AIFF has given the go ahead for clubs and academies to field foreign players in youth and kids leagues. But only those players whose parents reside in India and in the same city that the players are registered in are eligible to take part. 
 
 "Address proof, residential status must be provided as evidence (Indian passport holder parents with children with overseas passport, parents who have an OCIPIO card, or have a residential permit or work visa in India)," the AIFF wrote to all clubs and academies in a clarification after top clubs like   and even the   (GFA) criticised the AIFF move.
 
 AIFF general secretary   said foreign players ­ even if their parents reside in India ­ won't be allowed in any other competition but for young kids, it was only fair that they made an exception.
 
 "We got a fair bit of representation from parents whose kids don't have Indian passports. At age 12 to 15, if anyone wants to play football, we should not deprive them of the opportunity, whether they are Indians or expats," said Das.
