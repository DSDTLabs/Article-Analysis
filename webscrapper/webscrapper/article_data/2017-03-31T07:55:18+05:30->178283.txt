BENGALURU: The   ( ) passed last Monday may have been hailed as a pro-patient legislation, but city psychiatrists point to its lack of focus on community care and hint that caregivers and psychiatrists may not always have patients’ best interest in mind.

 Referring to the advanced directives of the bill that will now allow a patient to specify how he/she wants to be treated and who should be the nominated representative, Dr Vyjayanthi Bonanthaya, head of psychiatry department, Manipal Hospital said, “Patients can legally make use of this directive to avoid treatment. Mental disputes are still considered a taboo in our country, and most people tend to hide their symptoms and refuse treatment.”
 
 The bill, its critics say, expects patients to take a call though they might lack insight. “Severely ill patients might prefer to die than seek help. In such cases, precious time is lost just waiting for the decision of the mental health board to start involuntary treatment. Also, the role of the family members/caregivers has been largely ignored, leaving scope for manipulation of the mentally ill. While the rest of the world focuses more on community care of the mentally ill, this bill hardly looks at that area,” said Dr Bonanthaya.
 
 Psychiatrists feel the MHCB has failed to take into consideration the limits within which they have to deal with patients not willing to be treated.
 
 “The bill is highly restrictive and treats mental health professionals as persons never above suspicion. This will drive psychiatrists into highly defensive practices, which is certainly not a healthy trend,” said Dr Ajit V Bhide, vice-president,  , and head of the psychiatry department at St Martha’s Hospital. 
 
 Although the bill makes it difficult for the medical fraternity to administer appropriate treatment at the right time, it goes a long way in safeguarding patients’ human rights. Dr B N Gangadhar, director at   and  , said: “Treating patients who have been through torment and torture requires a lot of sensitivity and sensibility which this bill will ensure.”
 
 Will pave way for tech innovations 
 
 The bill supports the fact that a healthy mind is most essential for a healthy body, and has brought it under the realm of routine health. Now, this bill can pave the way for high-end technologies in fighting several mental disorders. A lot of gadgets can be incorporated to improve mental health, which will be easier under this bill.

 Decriminalizing suicide attempts may be detrimental
 
 If 80% of suicide attempts are due to serious mental illnesses like depression and hallucinations, the rest are due to a desire to get attention. There are some personality disorders where patients attempt suicide to gain attention and get things done their way. With decriminalization of suicide attempts, these tendencies can increase.
