Ahmedabad: This is a unique temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman. Here weddings of those who have eloped from home or couple of the same sex are arranged. The temple, situated in Sardar Nagar area of the city, has inspired a documentary made by National Institute of Design’s (NID) student of film and video communication.

 The documentary titled, ‘Welcome Valentine 2017’, has been selected as an entry in Film Southasia to be held in Nepal in November. The film has been selected in the student film category.
 
 Dhruv Satija, a native of Delhi, said that he got to know about the temple during his research on weddings. 
 
 “I found the concept very unique and visited the temple continuously for a week with the temple priest and visitors to understand the phenomenon. Valentine’s Day is the busy day at the temple as a number of couples turn up to tie the knot. I have included two cases in the documentary — one of an LGBT wedding (perhaps the second in India) and another of a couple who had eloped,” he said.
 
 Satija said that the documentary changes the perception of marriage. “For the temple authorities, it is just two people coming together. It doesn’t matter who are the persons as long as the couple is connected,” he said. 
 
 “The priest told us that he celebrates that connection through his work. Those coming to the temple feel accepted and understood, something which they would not experience in their own society. This the central message of the documentary,” Satija said.
