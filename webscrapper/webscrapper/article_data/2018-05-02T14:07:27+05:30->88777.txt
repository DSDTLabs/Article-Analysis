JAIPUR: The Pink City is not in the pink of health if the   ( ) pollution report is to go by. Jaipur is the most polluted city in the desert state, says the report.
 
  
 
 The report which figures 4,000 cities of 100 countries across the world has picked four cities of the state. 
 
 It is followed by Jodhpur, Kota, Alwar and Udaipur. The samples were collected in different years in different districts.
 
 The WHO has measured Particle Matter 10 (Particles smaller than 10 microns) in different cities of the world. 
 
 Jaipur recorded the highest level of PM10 in the state. The international standards of air pollution says that index value of 0-50 (micrograms per cubic meter air) is excellent, 51-100 is good, 101-150 is lightly polluted.
 
 “If the PM10 is more than 150, then it is alarming. If PM 10 is up to 100, then it is satisfactory,” said Dr Ajit Singh, respiratory allergy specialist, department of medicine, Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital. 
 
 He said, “The example of PM10 is dust particles, moulds and pollens. These particles easily reach upto the lungs to cause various diseases related to lungs and respiration.” 
 
 According to the health experts, PM10 particles can penetrate into the lungs and may enter the bloodstream. It can cause heart disease, lung cancer, asthma and acute lower respiratory infection. 
 
 The WHO’s collected annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) includes pollutants, such as sulphate, nitrates and black carbon, which pose the greatest risks to human health. Major sources of air pollution from particulate matter include the inefficient use of energy by households, industry, the agriculture and transport sectors, and coal-fired power plants. In some regions, sand and desert dust, waste burning and deforestation are additional sources of air pollution, says the WHO report.
