Vadodara: While the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) wants to rehabilitate residents of Kalyannagar in Tandalja, city-based activists have demanded that the civic body should rehabilitate them at the site. Out of around 2,000 families, 700 families are yet to be rehabilitated by the VMC.

 Activist and former professor of M S University J S Bandukwala said that when he met VMC commissioner, he was told that the funds for the construction of the residences at the same site have exhausted even as the project is half incomplete. “Commissioner told us that if residents accept the housing scheme in Tandalja, they will get possession within a month’s time but we want possession at the same site instead of ghettoization of Muslims in Tandalja,” said Bandukwala.
 
 He added that there has been corruption in the scheme and the commissioner has ordered enquiry but by shifting the residents to Tandalja, they want to sell off the flats to middle income group citizens which Muslims cannot afford.
 
  However, in the past when the civic body had shown a plot in Tandalja for rehabilitation, it was objected by residents and activists on the ground that plot is reserved for education purpose.
