TRICHY: Though the fourth day of the ongoing stir by   (TNSTC) employees on Sunday saw the operation of government buses improving to some extent as compared to the past two days of the strike, with professionals rushing back to their workplace after the weekend, the demand for buses continued in the Central bus stand particularly for the fleets connecting to Chennai. 

 Passengers, for the third consecutive day, complained about fleecing in private fleets including in the ones bound for Chennai, as many of the spare buses belonging to private operators are filling the gaps of grounded TNSTC fleets.
 
 While the trade unions of transport workers have demanded wage hike by 2.57 times (basic pay multiplied by 2.57), government was said to have agreed only for salary hike by 2.44 times which has caused the deadlock between them affecting normal operation of TNSTC fleets. At the five major depots in the city, though considerable numbers of buses have returned to operation at the mercy of part-time drivers and part-time conductors, safety of passengers commuting in the government buses has been raised as a concern. “The part-time drivers who are less experienced in driving the government run fleets are even struggling to get the vehicle out of Central bus stand. Irony is that we now prefer private buses over government buses mostly operated by temporary drivers, it was other way around a few days back,” K  , a passenger returning to Coimbatore said.
