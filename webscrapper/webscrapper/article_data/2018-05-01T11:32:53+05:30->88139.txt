JAIPUR: The JEE-Mains result has come as a disappointment for Jaipur which used to have strong presence in the top 100 ranks. This year, the only saving grace is Vipul Agarwal of Cambridge Court High School who secured 26th position in All India Rank. 

 A resident of Guijjar-Ki-Thadi, Agarwal is a recipient of prestigious National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) and   (KVPY) awards. He scored 335 marks in the exam and feels that he could have secured a position in top 10 had he not made some silly mistakes in chemistry and maths papers.
 
 “I missed out on some questions in inorganic chemistry. I wish I could have given more time to the subject. In maths I could not complete one question due to shortage of time which has cost me dearly," said Agarwal, who scored minimum of 105 in chemistry, 115 in physics and 115 in mathematics out of 120 marks in each subject. 
 
 Learning from his past mistakes, Agarwal has been revising the syllabus for JEE-Advanced, since he had appeared in JEE-Mains.
 
 “This time, my target is to find a place in the top 10 AIR in JEE-Advanced. I am reworking on my weak areas in order to score well,” said Agarwal who is expecting to score in the nineties in Class XII Science exam. 
 
 His interest in computers and mathematics has generated his interest in engineering since he was in upper primary. 
 
 “I developed an interest in computer science and IIT-Bombay is my obvious choice,” said Agarwal. Till the last report came in, four students secured ranks in the top 200 positions —   (109), Hardik Agrawal(148), Rishabh Daga (178) and   (179).
 
 Jaipur has been a major centre for   success stories. Last year, the number of qualified students in IITs from Jaipur were much higher than the entire North-East or states like Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab put together.
