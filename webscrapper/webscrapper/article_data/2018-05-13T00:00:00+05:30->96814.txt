When everyone is busy wishing their mother on the special day of Mother’s Day, how can our Marathi TV stars be left behind? Here are some of the #mothersday plans that our stars have planned for their moms.

  Raut from the show Vithu Mauli says, “Truly speaking I don’t believe in these days. But as I can’t meet my mom so frequently due to the shoots, I nowadays wait for such days. I have made a lot of plans for this year’s mother’s day. I personally can’t go to meet mom but still me and my sister have planned a surprise party for her. I have even got a surprise gift for her which I will give when I meet her.”
 
 Rupal Nand aka Radha from the TV show Goth said, “Mother’s Day is very special for me. Every year I celebrate this special day by giving her greetings, gifts and sweets. But this year, I am out for my shoots. But still, I am planning a surprise visit to my home.”
 
  Kulkarni aka Hrishi from Lek Mazhi Ladki also expressed his love for his mother. He said, “I always gift her the favourite things on Mother’s Day. Only because of her support I can stand in this field. My dimple is the gift that I have received a gift from her.”
