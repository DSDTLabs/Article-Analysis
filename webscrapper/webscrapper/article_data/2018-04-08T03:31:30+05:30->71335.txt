THANE: With the high temperature, there has been an increase in the number of commuters visiting the Emergency   ( ) in the past one month with complaints of dehydration and high  .

 The Rs 1-clinic has been getting visitors with complaints of high or low blood pressure everyday. “Most of the people who come to us with low or high blood pressure are women or senior citizens. Nowadays everyday we get at least around 15 to 20 of such patients. It happens as they do not eat properly or have skipped means and get stressed due to travelling. If we notice that a patient’s blood pressure has shot up, then we do not take any risks and immediately admit them to the government hospital or private hospital, depending on their preference,” said a medico from the EMR. 
 
 The EMR, which is set up at the station not only caters to railway accident commuters by giving them first-aid, but also conducts health check-ups of anyone coming to the clinic at a discounted rate. It is open for 24 hours and has three doctors and two nurses.
 
 From an average of 50 commuters a day, the number of visitors has increased to 100 since March. 
 
 “We see visitors mainly during peak hours and in the afternoon between 8am and 4pm. When patients with giddiness or dehydration come to us, we give them ORS or glucose water and make them rest till they feel better,” added the medico.
