NEW DELHI: An “adverse pre-sentence report” by jail authorities indicating that two of Jigisha Ghose’s killers were “incapable of being reformed” cut no ice with the  .

 Alleged involvement of   and   in another murder—that of TV executive Soumya Vishwanathan—and their less than satisfactory behaviour as undertrials had weighed heavily on the trial court while awarding them death penalty. In contrast, the trial court was lenient on the third accused   because of a better pre-sentence report.
 
 But the bench of justices S Muralidhar and I S Mehta pointed out that the jail conduct reports mainly gauged Kapoor and Shukla on the basis of their conduct as undertrials and not as convicts. “At this juncture, it is necessary to observe that as long as the trial is underway, the prisoner is an undertrial and is not given the same tasks as a convict. Further, the undertrial wards in Tihar Jail are usually overcrowded by over 100%,” the bench noted, indicating that there is more clarity when the person remains in jail as a convict.
 
 It also noted that the prosecution itself had conceded that Kapoor was a ‘sahayak munshi’ for about 14 months by the time of sentencing and during that period his conduct was satisfactory. “The behaviour of a prisoner during his term as an undertrial cannot be a sufficient marker for his potential for reform and rehabilitation,” the high court maintained. The bench added that in any event, the exercise of relying on a pre-sentence report can be done only after the court is convinced that the nature of a crime is such that it calls for extreme penalty. Interestingly, it was a bench headed by Justice Muralidhar that in 2014 had first relied on a behavioural examination of a rape-cum-murder convict to verify if he is capable of reform or not.
