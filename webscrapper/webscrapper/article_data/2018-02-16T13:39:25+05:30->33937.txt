MAPUSA: Thieves in Parsem were in for a rude shock when the automated teller machine (ATM) they stole from the   on Wednesday night turned out to be a passbook printing machine. Finding no cash in the machine, they later discarded it in the nearby area.

  police said the incident, which took place at an ATM located on a busy main road, came to light on Thursday morning following a complaint by the bankâ€™s branch manager. 
 
 Sources said that the ATM was under closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera surveillance but had no security personnel manning it. CCTV footage shows two masked men wearing gloves and red t-shirts trying to pry open the actual ATM with a hammer but did not succeed. Instead, they managed to uproot the passbook printing machine and take it to a nearby forest area. 
 
 In December 2017, unidentified persons had targeted two ATMs of two different nationalised banks along NH 17 at  , and had fled with cash amounting to over Rs 32 lakh. Both kiosks were not manned by security personnel. The accused were believed to have used gas cutters to break open both machines located about 1km from each other. Police had suspected it could be the handiwork of the same interstate gang which had targeted ATMs in several parts of the country, including Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka. Police had said that they had almost identified the gang that may have been involved in both the crimes but could not trace the accused yet.
 
 In September 2017, culprits had decamped with the ATM of State Bank of India installed at Agarwada. The machine was later recovered in a forested area a few kilometres away. Cash amounting to Rs 18.8 lakh was stolen from the machine. Police had made arrests in this case, including a member of an organised gang Vinod alias   from Delhi.
