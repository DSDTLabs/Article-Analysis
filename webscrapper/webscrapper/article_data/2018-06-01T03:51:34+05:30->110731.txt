MUMBAI: If you preferred to remain indoors and avoided heading out in the sun this May, it wasn’t the maximum   that caused you discomfort but the unusually high   levels.

 
 
  
 
 A close look at the May weather shows that   temperatures rose to just 35.5 degree Celsius unlike two months ago—on March 21, the city sweated under 41 degrees. Humidity levels, on the other hand, increased to 70-80% in May. The fourth week of the month, May 28 to be precise, saw the relative humidity levels rise further to 85% against 60-75% during the month last year. Health experts say that to feel comfortable, humidity levels should remain below 65%.
 
 K S Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region),  , said that during evening hours, humidity sometimes exceeded 90%. 
 
 “Winds were either north-westerly or westerly, and during the evenings, when sea breeze sets in, the recorded humidity levels touched 93% on some days. All these factors have been causing discomfort to residents,” he said. 
 
 Hosalikar further said that maximum temperatures at the start of May hovered around 33-34 degrees and as the season progressed, these only rose to 35 degrees. “But the moisture incursion coupled with high minimum temperatures, which on certain days touched 28-29 degrees, caused discomfort to citizens. This meant that neither were the morning hours comfortable nor the day time,” he said.
 
 Akshaye Deoras, an independent meteorologist, said westerly winds were very strong in May. 
 
 “Unlike the easterlies, which are known to be dry, westerlies were stronger, carrying with them a lot of moisture, which caused relative humidity to remain high,” he said.
 
  said the heat all through last month had made it difficult to move out during the day. 
 
 Ghatkopar’s Mansi Shah said she had been carrying an umbrella on most days. “I am looking forward to the   as the heat has got unbearable these past few days. The minute one steps out, one starts sweating.”
