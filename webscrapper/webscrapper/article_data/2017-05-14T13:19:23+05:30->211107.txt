BHUBANESWAR: The parking management at the city's Biju Patnaik   Airport (BPIA) has come under the scanner with several people complaining of being harassed and extorted by handlers hired by the contractor for the purpose. 

 Many visitors have alleged that they are being forced to pay a parking fee of Rs 55 in spite of exiting through the parking gate within five minutes -- the time limit set by the BPIA authorities for vehicles dropping and receiving passengers. 
 
 In 2013, the BPIA set a guideline to avoid confusion at the parking exit gate. According to the rules, there should be a five minute gap between entry and exit of vehicles, beyond which the vehicle is chargeable for parking. The BPIA authorities also admitted having received several complaints related to the parking fees issue. 
 
 "Even if the vehicle reaches the exit before five minutes, we get stuck in a queue that causes a delay. The handlers at the exit see the entry time and charge us a parking fee without accounting for a delay for which we are not responsible," said  , a businessman.
 
 The parking exit is where the time reading is taken. "This is an advantage to the parking contractor. The hired parking managers are terrorizing people. Ideally, they should see entry time on the receipt a little before the exit gate and pass those vehicles which have not crossed the five minute limit," said city resident and frequent flier, Piyush Rout. 
 
 Airport sources said around 2,500 vehicles come and go through the airport every day. To generate revenue from parking, the BPIA had engaged Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, to conduct a survey and set the time limit. The BPIA had also formed a committee comprising four officials of engineering and commercial departments of the airport to file a report on parking irregularities in 2014. 
 
 BPIA director   said after receiving complaints from people, they have increased the time limit to six minutes and engaged guards.
