BENGALURU: Unveiling 24 mobileIndira   for thecity on RepublicDay, chief minister Siddaramaiah said the canteens could be set up at bus stands, hospitals and colleges.

 “We can move beyond 198 Indira canteens in Bengaluru. Canteens should be set up in densely populated areas like around the Maharani’s College. While other parties say they want a Congress-free state, we want a hunger-free state, regardless of the party,” he said.
 
 Slamming the critics, he said, “While we must have parks in Bengaluru, will a canteen set up at the corner of a park make that much of a difference? The public must condemn those who oppose the construction of these canteens.”
 
 BBMP commissioner Manjunatha Prasad reiterated that the civic body does not want to limitthe number of canteens in the city to 198. “We will see if they can be extended to bus stations, hospitals and colleges. We will write to the principals of colleges across the city and seek their requirements. As for schools, we will assess their needs and then work outthefinancial implications,” he added.
 
 BBMP chief said the mobile canteens would have a five-day trial run, during which the staff would familiarize themselves with the routes . “From February 1, all 24 of them will be operational,” he added.
 
 
 
 
 Out of the 24 mobile canteens, nine will be in  , seven in West zone, three each in East zone and   and one each in   and Bommanahalli. These mobile canteens will stock up food and water at assembly kitchens and head to designated spots in respective wards. They will then return to the kitchen to drop off used plates and refuel.
 
 
 
 
 Each van will be equipped with CCTV cameras, a GPS tracking device and six foldable tables that will be set up around it once it starts serving food.
