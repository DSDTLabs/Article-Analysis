PATNA: The Patna police on Friday unearthed a spurious cement manufacturing factory in   village under the   police station area.

 Gaurichak police station   Sanjay Kumar said the factory was located in a secluded area. Factory owner   (34) was arrested.
 
 “More than 5,000 bags of poor quality cement, 2,000 bags of expired cement and at least 2,000 empty cement bags besides two tractors and several machines were seized from the factory,” the SHO said, adding new bags of at least five cement brands were also found in the factory.
 
 “Manish used to procure cement and let it solidify in the bag. He would later crush it and mix it with new cement and other materials and sell it,” the SHO said.
 
 He said   told police he had links with certain contractors in Patna and other districts to whom he used to supply spurious cement at lower than market prices. “Manish had been running the factory for at least three years. He used to shift the factory to different locations to evade detection,” the SHO said, adding further investigations were on.
