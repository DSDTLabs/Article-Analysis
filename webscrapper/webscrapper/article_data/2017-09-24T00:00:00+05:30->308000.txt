 Keep leather shoes in open or on a shoe rack, a box has humidity.

 
  If shoes get wet, stuff them with newspaper to dry. Don’t use a heater as that can crack the leather. 
 
 
  Soak a cloth in warm water to wipe the dust. Dry naturally, away from sunlight. Give them a break to let them breathe.
 
 
  Choose shoe trees made of cedar wood, they not only absorb the moisture but also maintain the shape of the shoe.
 
  Leather tends to lose its natural oils, moisture, and flexibility. Use a conditioner every two weeks. 
 
  We suggest pick up wax polishes which make the surface of the shoe shine, without penetrating through the leather. The wax polish creates a coating over the shoe and giving the appropriate amount of shine that is required.
