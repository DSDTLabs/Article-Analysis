 The valedictory speech was delivered by Professor  , a sociology professor from  . Speaking on the subject, "Endurance of caste system in India", Jodhka pointed out that caste has not been codified uniformly everywhere in the country. Like communities, he said, every region in the subcontinent has had a different set of castes. Even when notions of hierarchy and pollution have been common, normative systems guiding social interactions among individuals and groups have varied across regions. Caste would inevitably appear as an evolving system, actively intersecting with regional ecologies, the dynamics of local economic process and the regimes of power. Thus, to assume that the process of modernization/urbanization or introduction of a democratic political system ought to erase caste is founded on simplistic notions and flawed assumptions, he said. 
 
 "It is only through the alternative perspective suggested above that we can make sense of the persistence of caste even when its traditional 'eco-system' is significantly weakened or altered. Caste survives as a resource, positive and/or negative, a kind of social capital that reproduces inequalities in different spheres of life in contemporary India," Jodhka said. 
 
 PU vice-chancellor Professor Arun Kumar Grover acquainted participants with the way   has progressed from its inception in 1881.
