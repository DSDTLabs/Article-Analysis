CHENNAI: Whether or not CBI can continue the illegal telephone lines case against former Union minister Dayanidhi   will be known on March 14, when a special court for CBI cases passes orders on the DMK leader’s discharge plea.

 Special judge   said on Friday orders on the discharge petitions would be pronounced on March 14.
 
 Dayanidhi Maran and   were shown as main accused in the case . CBI chargesheet arraigned the Marans among others for allegedly using the high-speed data lines for Sun TV network’s commercial purposes, causing a loss of Rs 1.78 crore to the exchequer. S Kannan, chief technical assistant of Sun TV, and V Gowthaman, additional private secretary to Dayanidhi Maran, KS Ravi, electrician of Sun TV, and an official of BSNL Velusamy were shown as other accused in the case.
 
 Meanwhile, the Madras high court too reserved its orders on different case against Kalanithi Maran, who has challenged an income tax department order declaring him as principal officer of SpiceJet, thereby making him liable for the alleged tax dues of the company.
 
 Justice M Duraiswamy reserved the orders after hearing elaborate arguments from both sides.
 
 On Friday, Maran’s senior counsel PS Raman submitted that the former had not received any salary from the company and that he was non-executive chairman not involved in day-to-day affairs of the company. Managing director of SpiceJet had already given a letter to the I-T department to this effect, he said, adding that not a rupee was due to the department.
 
 Additional solicitor-general of India G Rajagopalan, however, said as per their own annual statements for the year 2012-13, Maran had 52% of share in the company and the registered office was shifted to Murasoli Maran Towers during his tenure as chairman of the company.
