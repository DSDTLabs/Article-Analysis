MUMBAI: Saamna alleged on Monday that the BJP government has thrived on money from contractors and builders. BJP will face its nemesis in the 2019 general elections, it said in an editorial.

 It indicated that Shiv   may walk out of the BJPled NDA. Sena is BJP’s senior-most poll partner in Maharashtra. “Let’s see how many MPs BJP bags in   in the 2019 polls without Sena,” it remarked.
 
 The editorial came close on the heels of Sena president Uddhav Thackeray’s speech at a party conclave.   had said his party would go solo for the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections in 2019. The latest comment is the Sena’s gameplan to keep BJP on tenterhooks ahead of the elections and consolidate sainiks for an electoral showdown, if any, with BJP, said observers.
 
 However, many in BJP feel Shiv Sena was making appropriate noises to extract a larger share of seats from BJP.
