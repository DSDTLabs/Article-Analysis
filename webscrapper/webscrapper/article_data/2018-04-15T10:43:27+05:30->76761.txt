HYDERABAD: Describing both   and   as 'bourgeois' parties, Nizamabad MP   on Saturday said chief minister and TRS president   is working on an alternative which, she said, would win the 2019 elections in the country. 

 "People are looking for a change in the country. The measures that the Telangana government took for welfare and protection of women, if implemented in the country, will help in preventing crimes against them. Both the BJP and Congress have failed and the new alternative front being formed by   will come to power in the next elections," she said at a press conference in Nizamabad. 
 
 Referring to the rape incidents in Jammu and Kashmir and UP, Kavitha said, "It is now clear that the culprits are being shielded." Stating that incidents of atrocities on women have increased, she said 'She Teams' in Telangana had been able to prevent crimes against women. 
 
 Kavitha said only 28 per cent cases of the total SC/ST cases in the country in the last 10 years had been solved. "We will not under any circumstance allow dilution of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act. The BJP government at the Centre has not effectively represented against the dilution of the provisions in the court," she said. 
 
 The MP said local boy Husamuddin Mohammad had done the country proud by winning a bronze medal in boxing in the Commonwealth Games and added that a felicitation would be organised for Mohammad once he returns.
