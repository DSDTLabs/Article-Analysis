KOLKATA: Centre has sent a missive to the state governments for observing   on January 30 -the   -at 11am in memory of those who laid their lives in the  . But Bengal government is reportedly unwilling to observe it.

 Most of the IAS officers in Nabanna and Writers' Buildings said that they did not receive any message.
 
 Though Nabanna reportedly received the letter a week ago, the government has not issued any directive.The reason is clear -Bengal government's strained relationship with the Centre.
 
 The Centre's letter had asked that two minutes' silence should not only be observed in state government offices, but also in the educational institutes. “The state was also asked to issue necessary instructions to the schools and colleges. But it was not followed,“ a senior official of school education department said.
 
 Nabanna officials said though they won't observe the two-minute silence, they will garland Gandhi's statue. A Nabanna official on condition of anonymity said that the CM gave a clear instruction to ignore all letters from the Centre. “We are also not supposed to reply to any of these letters,“ he added.
 
 The letter sent to Nabanna asks for using sirens or Army guns before the commencement and on termination of two minutes' silence. But the state officials find it a difficult proposition as the government offices here, including the state secretariat Nabanna and the Writers' Buildings, don't have any siren. The letter stated: “On hearing the signal at 11am all people should stand up and observe silence, preferring people to gather at one place to observe silence.“ The letter also stated that the two-minute silence should be observed in all public places.
 
 Asenior official, though, said that petty politics should not come in the way of paying homage to the martyrs.
