Singer Louis   and ex-girlfriend Briana   ringed in son Freddie's first birthday together. 

 Jungwirth shared a video on her Instagram page in which the One Direction singer smiles as he helps the little boy stand while his mom presents him with a white frosted cake bearing the child's photo and the words "Happy birthday Freddie."
 
 "Special first birthday," she wrote. 
 
 "Had a special day today with my birthday boy. Thanks for all the lovely messages!" Tomlinson tweeted. 
 
 The 25-year-old singer became the first member of the pop group to become a dad when Jungwirth, a Los Angeles stylist who dated him in 2015, gave birth to their son. The two then got involved in a custody battle over the boy. 
 
 Tomlinson went on to date The Originals actress  , 21.
