Ghaziabad: A 65-year-old woman was killed when a speeding auto-rickshaw ploughed into passengers alighting from another auto-rickshaw in Ghaziabad on Monday. The woman has been identified as Prakashi Devi.

 The woman’s elder son Suresh (40) and daughter-in-law Pushpa (33), who were also seriously injured in the accident, have been admitted to the GTB Hospital in Delhi.
 
 The accident took place at Mohan Nagar crossing on Monday afternoon when Prakashi Devi was travelling to Bodaki in Greater Noida, her maternal home, along with Suresh and Pushpa. The family lives in Nistauli village near Tila Mod in Sahibabad. 
 
 “They had travelled in a shared auto from Tila Mod to Mohan Nagar via the air force station road where they would have changed to another auto. As they were getting down the auto at Mohan Nagar crossing, another loaded auto came from behind and ploughed into them. Doctors at the GTB Hospital have told us that Pushpa has sustained more injuries than Suresh. None of them has been admitted to the ICU though,” said Manoj.
 
 Prakashi Devi was rushed to the Narendra Mohan Hospital in Mohan Nagar where she succumbed to her injuries. “We have received a formal complaint from the family of the deceased woman. An FIR will be registered under relevant sections of the IPC,” said Sahibabad SHO Rakesh Singh.
