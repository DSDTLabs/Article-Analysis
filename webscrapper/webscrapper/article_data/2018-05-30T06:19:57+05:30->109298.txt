CHENNAI: Actor   has approached the   seeking to quash a private complaint of defamation lodged by a film financier against him before a city metropolitan magistrate court.

 
 The film financier   had approached the VII metropolitan magistrate court in George Town, seeking defamation proceedings against the actor who has now moved the high court to quash the complaint.
 
 Bothra had claimed that Rajinikanth’s daughter’s father-in-law   had obtained a loan of Rs 40 lakh from him on January 2, 2012, and agreed to repay the same with interest, the actor said in his petition.
 
 The financier claimed that Kasthuri Raja later approached him on July 13, 2012, for a further loan of Rs 25 lakh for which he demanded surety. Bothra also alleged that Kasthuri Raja wrote a letter on the same day stating that even if he failed to pay the loan, Rajinikanth would pay it.
 
 As Kasthuri Raja failed to pay back the loan, the financier moved a criminal case against him which was eventually dismissed.
 
 Subsequently, based on the alleged letter written by Kasthuri Raja, the financier moved the civil court against Rajinikanth to recover the loan. The actor filed an application claiming that the suit had been moved with an intention to extort money from him.
 
 Now, claiming that the allegation of Rajinikanth has brought disrepute to him, the financier has moved a private complaint of defamation which was taken cognizance of by the magistrate who in turn ordered summons to Rajinikanth.
 
 Assailing the summons, the actor has moved the high court. The plea is likely to be heard by the vacation court on Wednesday.
