LUCKNOW: Contractual employees at chief minister's helpline 1076, most of them women, staged a protest on Friday over non-payment of salary. They alleged that they were beaten up and locked in a room at the   office in Vibhutikhand. 

 The protest continued for hours and the mob dispersed only when police detained and challaned four men. A staffer,  , said that they were not allowed to punch their cards when they entered office at 7am, and were told to mark attendance on a paper to which they protested.
 
 "We told them to give our salaries and we would leave. The officials took us into a room for negotiation but locked us in," she alleged. Police said that they received a call around 7.30am from a woman who said that around 100 women employees of CM helpline were locked in a room and some had consumed a substance.
 
 A police team led by SHO Vibhutikhand, Satendra Rai reached the spot and opened the room. Rai said that CCTV footage is being examined to ascertain the turn of events.

 Additional city magistrate (IV)   said that 150 employees were protesting while others were discharging their duties. Project head of the call centre   told TOI that salaries had been deposited into the account of all employees on February 8. "We have 1,200 employees working in three shifts. Only some have problems because of bank issues," said Mishra.
