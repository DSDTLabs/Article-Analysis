LUCKNOW: Less than a week after the Dalit   gave chief minister   the ‘Dalit Mitra’ award, its president Lalji Prasad   was appointed chairperson of the UP Scheduled Caste Finance and Development Corporation on Wednesday.

 The Mahasabha’s decision to award the CM was mired in controversy with some of its founding members objecting to this award, saying that Dalits across the country were being harassed under the BJP regime and the present, of all times, was not the best for giving such an award.
 
 The day the award was presented to the CM, on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14, the antiaward members were arrested from outside the presentation venue for carrying out a protest.
 
 SR Darapuri, a lifetime member of the Mahasabha, had accused Nirmal of trying to appease the government for personal gains. He said: “Dr Nirmal’s announcement for presenting the award to the CM was not on behalf of the Mahasabha. When Dalits are being harassed by BJP governments, why is he giving an award to a BJP CM? After the all-India protest by Dalits on April 2, where outsiders joined our rallies and tried to malign the movement by indulging in violence, the government has taken action was taken against Dalits. In UP, an ex-MLA in   was framed while several Dalit boys were arrested,” Darapuri said.
 
 Brushing aside the internal rebellion as spurred by political forces, Nirmal on April 14 also announced that the next Dalit Mitra award would be given to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
