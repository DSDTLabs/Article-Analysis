MUMBAI: What happens to the rotten fruits, vegetables and fish that remain unsold in the markets? In the  , all such waste will turn into manure to be sold to farmers as   is in the process of installing  .

 The BMC already initiated the process of installing converters in five markets. There are around three dozen BMC markets in the city. So, in the 2018-19  , BMC chief Ajoy Mehta has allocated Rs 12 crore for installing organic converters in the remaining markets. Civic officials have roped in market associations to use the converters.
 
 In line of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, BMC is laying emphasis on keeping the city clean through large allocations for garbage disposal and setting up new plants at dumping grounds. The BMC has made provision for mechanical sweeping of city beaches.
 
 The BMC will also conduct special programme to convince people to process wet-waste at source, to reduce the burden on the cityâ€™s three dumping grounds. Officials said that earlier the city was generating 9,500 tonnes of waste daily, which was a manipulated figure of contractors to increase their profit. Following strict vigilance by BMC, the amount of garbage going to the dumping grounds decreased drastically. In the meantime, the BMC started to convince bulk garbage generators to process their wet waste in their own premises. Consequently, around 7,100 tonnes of garbage goes to the three dumping grounds now. 
 
 The BMC has issued notices to 3,337 bulk garbage generators to process their garbage at source, out of which only 650 have complied with the BMC warning.
 
 In the budget, BMC has proposed to set up a waste to energy plant at   dumping ground for which it has allotted Rs 209 crore. It has also allotted Rs 65 crore to invite bids to bio mine 7 million tonnes of waste at Mulud dumping ground which the BMC decided to close down.
