NEW DELHI: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the voters in the city to “throw out” BJP from the corporations and AAP from the Delhi government.

 Addressing a public meeting at Subhash Nagar, an area dominated by Punjabi voters, Singh said he was obliged to DPCC for exposing the incompetence of the AAP-led Delhi government. 
 
 The Punjab CM campaigned for the party candidate Meenakshi Chandela, who is contesting for the Rajouri Garden assembly seat where by-election will be held on April 9.
 
 “What can AAP do for the people of other states when it is not able to pay the salaries of the sanitation workers of Delhi? CAG had noted that the Kejriwal government squandered crores of rupees of the hard-earned money of the people of Delhi for publicity in Punjab. Now, the lieutenant governor of Delhi has directed AAP to deposit Rs 97 crore in the coffers of the Delhi government,” said Singh.
 
 In his speech, DPCC chief Ajay Maken said when Congress was in power in Delhi, DTC had a fleet of 5,445 buses, which came down to 4,200 buses later. “The AAP government has spent crores of rupees on advertisements and development has come to a halt in the capital. The dropout percentage in Delhi government schools has gone up—about 98,000 have dropped out since AAP has come to power,” Maken alleged.
 
 He added that Congress was confident of winning the Rajouri Garden seat in the assembly bypoll as well as the civic elections. We have released a blueprint to streamline the corporations by focusing on the issues and providing solutions. We don’t want to make announcements and offer everything for free. BJP has removed all its sitting councillors because they know they have failed.”
