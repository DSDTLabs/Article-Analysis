RAIPUR:   on Saturday squarely blamed Prime Minister   for 'squandering' the 2014 mandate, saying that it is a total betrayal of public trust that was reposed on him four years back. 

 "Every section of the society is feeling cheated. They have systematically destroyed the entire social fabric and engineered a great divide in society",   general secretary PL Punia told reporters here as the Modi-led government at the Centre completed four years in office.
 
 "Prime Minister   is all talk and no show. The government has betrayed the people", Punia said, adding that all promises made by the Prime Minister and his party during the 2014 elections remained unfulfilled.
 
 Punia pointed out that the BJP had promised to double the income of farmers and increase support price on farm produce but all these promises have remained unfulfilled. He said that crop insurance did not benefit farmers but made the insurance companies mint money.
 
 Punia said that after the Karnataka assembly polls, prices of petroleum products are on the rise and the government has miserably failed to contain the price rise. He said that despite prices of crude oil declining in the international market, the government is busy earning money by imposing excise duty on petroleum products.
 
 Accusing the Modi government of having failed on multiple fronts, the   leader said that the BJP government had betrayed the Dalits and tribals and the situation has become so bad that even BJP's own members of   are describing the government as anti-Dalit.
 
 Punia said that the Modi government is also systematically and deliberately weakening democratic institutions in the country, including the judiciary and media. "Modi only knows marketing, not governance", Punia alleged.
