 KOLKATA: Forty-eight hours after three men barged into a house at Baguiati’s   and fled with cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 2.5lakhs, cops have arrested three youths from the Dum Dum and Nagerbazar areas for being involved in the incident.
 
 
 Surprisingly, cops found that one of the accused was in regular touch with the victim, Swapna   (52), through social media and WhatsApp. “Sanjib Das, who introduced himself as Akash to the victim, had gathered information about the house while chatting with Kundu on WhatsApp,” claimed a senior officer investigating the case.
 
 Cops said they arrested two more associates of Sanjib, who were identified as   (28) and   (33).
 
 “We have arrested the three based on technical and local sources,” said Amit Jawalgir, DC (headquarters).
 
 The victim also acknowledged that she knew Sanjib, but expressed her surprise at the turn of events. “This person used to call me ‘Chhoto Ma’. I also know his sister. I cannot imagine he had established contact with me only to plan a robbery,” Kundu told reporters.
 
 From the initial stage of investigation, the cops probing the robbery suspected that men close to the family were behind the armed heist, which took place around 7.30pm on Sunday.
 
 Kundu had informed the police that the robbers were wearing helmets when they entered the house and held a knife at her throat.
 
 “We had recorded Kundu and her neighbours’ statements for leads. The incident happened barely five minutes after her husband left home and when their daughter was away. Such information can only be known to someone very close to the family,” said a senior police officer investigating into the incident.
 
 Keeping in mind that somebody close to the family had committed the robbery, the cops began investigations and looked into call details of the family members.
