VISAKHAPATNAM:   in the port city reverberated with melody as Bollywood’s playback singer   enthralled a houseful of audience with superhot songs at a concert held at the Andhra University  . The concert is aimed at raising funds for cancer patients under the Rohit Memorial Trust, Gyan Lakshmi Project.

 The nightingale of Bollywood, who began her musical journey at the age of six and won seven Filmfare awards and two national awards, made all heads turn as she entered the stage by walking among the audience in the hall which was almost full with over 1,000 occupants. She commenced with her all-time famous number ‘Tum Paas Aaye’ from the film ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’ amidst huge applause from the audience. One after another, romantic and foot-tapping numbers followed such as ‘Gazab ka hai din,’ ‘Lal dupatta ud gya re’ ‘Zaara tasveer se tum’, ‘Raah mein unse mulaquat ho gayi,’ and ‘Dekha tumko jabse’.
 
 “I am fortunate that I’m at a function for a noble cause. This is my first time in Vizag. Since many years, I wanted to perform in Vizag but it didn’t materialise for one reason or the other but finally, the time came today. People of Vizag are lively with a lot of josh. I would like to see it today as they dance to my songs,” said Alka at the start of the concert.
