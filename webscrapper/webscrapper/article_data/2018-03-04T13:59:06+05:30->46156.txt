It looks like fans of Superstar   are quite upset about   teaser leak. An unfinished video with temporary graphics got leaked on the internet. The leaked footage which is around 44 seconds long was immediately shared by many on social media. Though there were a few fans who were elated to get a glimpse of their Thalaivar in the teaser, most of them were extremely unhappy by this act. 

 Movie buffs and critics criticized the alleged leak stressing on how so many years of hard work of technicians goes in vain in few minutes. 
  slammed the act on her micro-blogging page, “Leaking content online before the official release should not be TOLERATED or ENCOURAGED ! This is a heartless act ignoring hard work, efforts and sentiments of the makers for few seconds of excitement !!! #BeAshamed #StopPiracy #StopMisusingDigitalMedium.”
 
 2.0 has Rajinikanth,   and   playing the lead roles and Oscar winner AR Rahman composing the music. It was only recently that Rajinikanth’s Kaala teaser was leaked.
