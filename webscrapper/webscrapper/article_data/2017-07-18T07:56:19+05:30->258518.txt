After weeks of building the Kurt Angle-Corey Graves storyline, the big reveal finally happened at Monday Night RAW Nashville with   coming out to the middle of the ring and talked about his past and how his actions in the past has now come back to haunt him and his family. 

 Conspiracy theories about what would be Angle’s big reveal ranged from Secret Lovers in Dixie Carter, Stephanie McMahon to Gay lovers and illegitimate child angle. Eventually, it turned out to be the last one and former NXT and SmackDown Live tag team champion   was announced as the newest member of the RAW roster, as Kurt Angle’s son. 
 
  
  
 
 Well it might disappoint a lot of fans, and this turned out to be a low-profile reveal with the segment not slated to either open or end the show. It was glorified way to announce a member to the roster for sure. With his tag partner Chad Gable set for a big single push at SmackDown Live, Jordan had to be put in somewhere and no one would have been better than Kurt Angle. The former amateur wrestler is also slated for a big push it may seem under the tutelage of Kurt Angle. 
 
 Jordan who had started out a singles competitor in NXT without much success before becoming a tag specialist, first tagging with Tye Dillinger and then finding success with Gable. It would be interesting to see how Jordan fares again as a singles competitor.
