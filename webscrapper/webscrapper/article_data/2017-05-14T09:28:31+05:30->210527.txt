PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The state government will draw inspiration from the individual toilet model implemented by the   in Pimpri Chinchwad. 

 Under this model, the beneficiaries will directly receive construction material, instead of a monetary subsidy. This development was confirmed by chief secretary Sumit Mullick on Saturday. 
 
 Mullick, who inaugurating the 1,500th toilet constructed by the NGO in Balajinagar slum in Bhosari, said, “The model being implemented in PCMC areas has met with success as people use the raw materials to quickly finish the construction. In other areas, beneficiaries who directly get money spend it for other purposes.”
 
 Going by his words, Mullick came to know one could construct a toilet in a small hut only after visiting Balajinagar. 
 
 Seema Savale, PCMC standing committee chief and local corporator, said, “There are 2,500 huts in the slum of which individual toilets have been built in 1,500.” Pratima Joshi, founder and executive director of Shelter Associates, said, “Now there are toilets in 77% of the huts and we will hit the 80% mark soon.” 
 
 Bhagyashree Dhadke, a local resident, said, “We would get eve-teased when we went to public toilets in the area. We could not even complain for the fear of backlash from the culprits. With toilets in our homes, we don’t have to face this issue again.”
