POINGUINIM: The government’s ambitious plan of eradicating open defecation appears to have taken a back seat in  ,  . Residents, especially women living in rented rooms, face a harrowing time due to the lack of adequate sanitation facilities.

 A large number of workers stay in rented rooms which lack basic sanitation amenities. This has raised concerns among locals who are angered about the filthy conditions in parts of Bhatpal village.
 
 “Those giving rooms on rent should provide toilets. Else, those who have been allowed to stay on rent should make necessary arrangements,” Pedro Fernandes, a local resident, said.
 
 Many of those occupying comunidade land have allegedly built rooms which they let out on rent to migrant workers. Most of these rooms, however, lack basic facilities such as toilets. “The comunidade land is for those who do not have land to construct houses and not for rental purposes,” Fernandes said. 
 
 Shristhal panchayat sarpanch Devendra Naik says that the panchayat has taken note of the lack of toilets in the area and the urgent need for the same. The area has been surveyed by the government and funds will be allocated to the panchayat for construction of toilets, he said. 
 
 The other issues the residents of the area face are inadequate drinking water and poor power supply. S Desai, a local resident, said the pipeline supplying drinking water to residential houses is inadequate as more residential units have been built in the area. “Also, now that these residential units have increased, the power supply is inadequate,” Desai said.
