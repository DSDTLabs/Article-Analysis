MUMBAI: More than two years after the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) initiated criminal proceedings against several figures, including   leader   and developer Prasanna Chamankar, for their involvement in the Maharashtra Sadan scam, a question mark looms over the proceedings. 

 The documents on the basis of which the officials lodged the FIR are not available with the graft-probing agency. On October 16, 2017, Chamankar had sought documents pertaining to the transfer of Sirmur plot in Delhi to the state government, minutes of the cabinet committee meeting on infrastructure held on March 22, 2004, and action taken thereon. Chamankar also sought records on whether or not tenders were floated for Maharashtra Sadan’s construction in accordance with the decision taken in the meeting on March 22, 2004, and papers pertaining to the tenders and all documents in connection with the public work department’s correspondence with a construction firm that was also in the race.
 
 After the ACB failed to provide him the information, Chamankar filed an appeal before acting chief information commissioner Ajit Kumar Jain on November 6, 2017. On January 1, 2018, Jain asked the ACB to submit a notarised statement on the status of documents sought by Chamankar. Assistant police commissioner M N Mugutrao submitted a notarised statement, stating that documents sought by Chamankar were not available in the ACB’s records.
 
 Chamankar contended that the case is based on the documents pertaining to the transfer of Sirmur plot in Delhi to the state government for construction of Maharashtra Sadan and decisions taken by the cabinet committee on infrastructure headed by then chief minister  . “If crucial documents are not available in the ACB’s records, how did it come to a conclusion that there was corruption. We will submit all the relevant documents and replies given by the ACB before the competent authority,’’ Chamankar said.
