NOIDA: Labelled   immigrants by a section of residents, inhabitants of a slum in Noida Sector 78, where most domestic helps working in the area live, staged a protest on Thursday, displaying their Aadhaar and voter cards to say they were as much citizens of India as any other Indian.

 Most of the participants in the demonstration, at Sector 49 police station, were women and children, among them family members of the 13 men arrested for Wednesday morning’s mob violence at Mahagun Moderne. They said they were worried about their future as the men had been put behind bars and Moderne had barred helps from the society temporarily.
 
 “We are all Indians and we have all the proof you need. We only came to Noida for a better future. But now, w are being called Bangladeshi. This move will make us jobless. It is strange that we should be called illegal   in our own motherland,” said 22-year-old Nasreen.
 
 Sabina, whose husband Younis Ali is among those arrested, pleaded with police officials for his release. “We know there was violence, but many of us were not even involved,” said Hasna Banoo, who works as a domestic help and lives in the slum in next to Antriksh Golf View 1. 
 
 The women said they do not have the money to hire a lawyer and remained on the police station premises till late in the evening, hoping for some respite from the cops. Some of them had brought water bottles and food for the arrested men.
 
 Circle officer Avneesh Kumar said the police will ensure residents only hire maids after verification.
