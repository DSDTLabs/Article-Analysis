BAREILLY: The political drama surrounding the much-awaited Shyamatganj flyover in the city is far from over. Days after   MLA   opened the unfinished flyover, it was formally inaugurated by Union minister  , state finance minister   and mayor   on Sunday amid the chanting of mantras. But not before finance minister Agarwal seized the occasion to say that the project was first proposed by him to various government functionaries. Notably, it was largely constructed during the previous   regime. The construction agency, UP Bridge Corporation (UPBC), had commenced work on October 26, 2016 at a cost of Rs 30.3 crore.
 
  “I thought of a flyover in the area in 1996 and discussed about it with various people. The previous mayor IS Tomar was not convinced and even said there was no need for one. Then I met SP leader Shivpal Yadav and finally the work was started,” said Agarwal.
  
  Union minister Gangwar, in the meanwhile, said, “This is not an appropriate time for debate. Development is an ongoing process. Our main focus must be to strengthen infrastructure of the city.”
  
  Tomar, who was not invited to the function, said, “What Agarwal said is nothing but false statements. He should show the letters which he had written to government officials. If there was anyone to whom the credit for the flyover goes, it is former chief minister  .”
  
  Notably, several SP workers, led by its district president Sublesh Yadav, had also tried to open the under-construction flyover in the past. On Sunday, in the meanwhile, hundreds of SP men arrived after the inauguration ceremony was over and held a bicycle rally near the flyover.
