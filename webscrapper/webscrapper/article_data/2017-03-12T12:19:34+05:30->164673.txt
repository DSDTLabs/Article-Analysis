PANAJI: Of the nine-lakh-plus voters in the state who came out on February 4, 1.2% chose to push the None of the Above ( ) button, the highest among the four states that went to the polls said chief electoral officer Kunal.

 The highest number of NOTA votes for a constituency in Goa, 550, was recorded in Poriem, closely followed by Mandrem Pernem, Priol and Mapusa, which recorded more than 400 NOTA votes.
 
 “I felt none of the candidates were worthy of my vote. I knew it wouldn’t make a difference, but I wanted to exercise my right to vote,” Gaurav Phadte said, asserting that NOTA qualifies as a ‘vote’. 
 
 Ganpat Kurtikar, secretary of the RTI forum also signed the register and recorded his note of dissent on polling day. “There was lack of awareness created of NOTA option by the Election Commission. Nobody could explain the right to recall option. I don’t see why we have to allow greedy politicians who use their powers against the common man, to rule for five years. When we have a second option, why not use it.”
 
 The option was introduced by the   to enable those electors who don’t wish to vote for any of the candidates, to exercise their right to vote for none of the candidates contesting.
