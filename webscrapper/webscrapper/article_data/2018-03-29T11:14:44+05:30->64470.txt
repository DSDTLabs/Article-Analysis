The highly anticipated   biopic was finally launched amidst much fanfare on Thursday. Given the stature of NTR in the history of Telugu cinema and politics, the biopic launch was done on a grand scale and the event was graced by Vice President  . Nandamuri   plays the role of NTR in the film and the actor was in his element as he dressed up as   for the symbolic 'Muhurtham shot'. A lavish stage was set up with a large throne in the middle. Balakrishna was fully adorned with jewellery and wore a large gold crown above his head. 

 "NTR had changed the face of Telugu cinema and put the interest of all Telugus in his heart when he took the plunge into politics. He was the one who gave recognition to the Telugu community at the national stage and he will always be an icon for us. Though normally, Presidents or Vice Presidents don't attend film events, I decided to come because of the respect I have for NTR. I also believe that cinema is a powerful medium and can truly honour his life and I wish his son Balakrishna the very best in his endeavour," Venkaiah Naidu said. 
 
 Directed by  , the film is being produced by Balakrishna along with Sai Korrapati and Vishnu Vardhan Induri.
