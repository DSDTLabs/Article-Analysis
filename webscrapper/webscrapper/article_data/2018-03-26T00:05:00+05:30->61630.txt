Former Bigg Boss contestant   seems to be expanding her horizons. The actress is currently busy in Hyderabad shooting for her first   serial — the female-oriented  . But the move to the neighbouring state means that she has had to quit Bharjari Comedy, the show she was doing in Kannada. According to a source from the channel, Sanjana was not able to allot dates for her   show, owing to her schedule for Neeli Kaluvalu.

  When we asked Sanjana about it, she did not confirm the date issues, but admitted that travelling between the two cities was getting too hectic for her. Speaking to us from the set of the serial, she says, “I want to try my luck on Telugu television, and, the role that was offered to me was so enticing that I couldn’t reject it. There is no hero in the serial, and the story revolves around my character. I play a very bubbly and energetic girl, who never takes a step back in her life.” 
 
  The actress says that offers haven’t stopped coming her way from Sandalwood. “I got a couple of offers in Kannada films, but the roles were not impressive. I will work in Sandalwood only if I get appropriate roles,” she adds.
