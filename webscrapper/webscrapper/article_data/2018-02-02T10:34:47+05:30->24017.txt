CHENNAI: In the light of the allegations regarding over-invoicing in the purchase of imported coal for state power utility Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation ( ), electricity minister P Thangamani on Wednesday said coal was sourced only through the Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation of India, a central PSU, and that there were no irregularities. He was responding to allegations by Chennai-based   that coal imported from Indonesia in 2012-2016 was significantly costlier than the market price, which caused a loss of 1700- 3025 crore to the exchequer, by toggling with the moisture specifications and calorific value of the coal. 

 The minister's statement is contradictory to the information in the public domain, which shows that the majority of coal imported from Indonesia between 2012 and 2016 was supplied by private conglomerates like the Adani group and Chettinad group. Replies to a query filed under the RTI Act by Arappor Iyakkam show that in the 2012-2016 period only seven of the 19 supplies were made by   like   and MSTC. The rest were supplied by Adani Global Pte Ltd, Knowledge International Strategy Systems Pvt Ltd and  .
 
 On Thursday, when contacted by TOI, Thangamani reiterated his statement. "Procured coal is routed through PSUs like MMTC. Even those supplied by private agencies. The central PSUs are in-charge of the quality checks. If the quality is poor, money is deducted or the consignment is sent back. But there has been no such incident with Tangedco's coal supplies," he said.
