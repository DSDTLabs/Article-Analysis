NEW DELHI:   questioned AAP MLA   for four hours on Thursday in connection with the alleged midnight assault on chief secretary   last week. 

 Earlier in the day, police said they served notice to two MLAs -   and Rajesh Rishi - asking them to join the probe at 4pm on Thursday. Tyagi, it is learnt, has sought time till next week because his mother is ailing.
 
 Rishi appeared before the police around 5pm. He was questioned on the sequence of events that night and asked to give a detailed account. This will be corroborated with the statement of others present there.
 
 Police said Rishi was evasive in his answers and denied having assaulted Prakash, or that he saw him getting beaten up.
 
 
 
 
 Sources said, during the interrogation, Rishi claimed that he had stepped out to attend phone calls during the alleged incident. He claimed that he had returned to the room when the chief secretary had already left. Cops however say that he might again be called for questioning. Rishiâ€™s phone would be scanned to verify his claims as well.
 
 Police said the decision to question Rishi and Tyagi was taken after eyewitnesses claimed that they had seen the two leave with the arrested MLAs after the alleged assault.
 
 While police have already arrested MLAs Amantullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal for the attack, other MLAs are being questioned aspolice have invoked sections of criminal conspiracy(120B) and common intention (34) in the case. This indicates that the cops will probe the role of every person present at the spot. Khan and Jarwal are lodged in Mandoli jail.
 
 Apart from the two, nine other MLAs present during the alleged attack are Ajay Dutt, Rajesh Rishi, Rajesh Gupta, Rituraj Govind, Madan Lal, Praveen Kumar, Dinesh Mohania, Sanjeev Jha and Nitin Tyagi.
