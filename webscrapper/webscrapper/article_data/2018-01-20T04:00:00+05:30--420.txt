 Mumbai: The country’s most-valuable private lender   reported a net profit of Rs 4,642.6 crore for the quarter ended December 2017 — an increase of 20.1% over Rs 3,865 crore in the corresponding period last year. The bank’s shareholders on Friday approved a capital-raising plan of Rs 24,000 crore. Announcing the results on Friday, HDFC Bank deputy MD Paresh Sukthankar said that the timing of the capital-raising was uncertain as the bank had to obtain permission from the government for it. “This capital is primarily to beef up our capital adequacy ratio to support growth in coming years,” said Sukthankar. Shares of the bank closed 1% higher at Rs 1,951.
 
 The growth in net profit was driven by a 28.7% increase in retail loans and 26.4% rise in wholesale loans. Total advances as of December 31, 2017 were Rs 6,31,215 crore — an increase of 27.5% over December 31, 2016, and 4.4% over September 30, 2017. Total deposits as of December 31, 2017 were Rs 6,99,026 crore — an increase of 10.1% over December 31, 2016. Sukthankar said that after a long time, loans were growing at a much faster pace than deposits. “If current liquidity conditions persist, there could be upward pressure on deposit and lending rate.”
 
 In its results, the bank disclosed that the Reserve Bank of India’s risk-based supervision had found divergences worth Rs 2,052 crore in gross non-performing asset ( ) classification for FY17. As against the   of Rs 5,885 crore reported as of March 2017, the   assessed NPAs to be at Rs 7,937 crore.
 
 The bank’s gross NPAs were at 1.29% of gross advances as on December 31, 2017, as against 1.26% as on September 30, 2017 and 1.05% as on December 31, 2016. Net NPAs were at 0.4% of net advances as on December 31, 2017. HDFC Bank, the most valuable in the sector with a market capitalisation of more than $78 billion, has the lowest bad-loan ratio among India’s top lenders as it focuses on retail clients and has relatively smaller exposure to segments such as infrastructure financing.
