ALLAHABAD:The state government has allocated Rs 1,500 crores for holding   in 2019. UP finance minister   declared this while presenting the Yogi government's second annual Budget in the Assembly on Friday. 

 The allocation is about 37% more than that of last year when Rs 1,098 crores were sanctioned for conducting the fair.
 
 Apart from it, a provision of Rs 1,650 crores has been made under the Smart City Mission for 10 cities, including Allahabad.
 
 Last year the city had got Rs 288 crores for the   project, but work stopped after finalisation of two routes only. This year, Rs 500 crores has been allocated for all Metro rail projects in the state.
 
 The developmental projects are slated to be unfolded simultaneously for conducting Kumbh.
 
 Kamlesh Singh, district monitoring committee,   (NGRBA), said, "The announced amount is less compared to a budget of around Rs 3,200 crores spent on   held in   in 2016. Besides, the allocation is also not systematic."
