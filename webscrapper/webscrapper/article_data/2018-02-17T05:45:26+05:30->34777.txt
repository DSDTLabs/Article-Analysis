MUMBAI:   imposed a fine of Rs20,000 on   government over "illegal action" of revenue officials to seize vehicles and goods. A division bench of Justices   and Rajesh Ketkar ordered the release of vehicles carrying ready-mix plaster from Gujarat to Maharashtra and told the state to pay legal costs to the two petitioners. The court said the state can recover the amount from the erring officials. 

 "Revenue officials must produce attached vehicles before the collector within 48 hours. This seizure of vehicles, without verifying if the act alleged was an offence or violation of any regulation, and failing to produce them before the prescribed authority to facilitate their release causes great prejudice and financial loss to the owners. Apart from harassment on account of illegal actions of revenue officials in seizing vehicles and goods, there is failure to observe provisions of (the law)," the judges said.
 
 The authorities had seized the vehicles carrying plaster at Dahanu, claiming it was in violation of a circular issued by the Palghar Collector, which prohibits taking sand out from Gujarat. The revenue authorities told the owners to pay a fine of around Rs 3 lakh. The collector's directives were based on rules of the state of Gujarat. The vehicle owners pointed out that they were carrying the plaster (which had sand as an ingredient) on which GST had been paid, and it was not sand. The owners also pointed out that rules of the Gujarat government prohibiting transportation of sand had been struck down by Gujarat high court. 
 
 "The reliance has been placed by the collector, Palghar, on the notification issued by the state of Gujarat, for issuing illegal directions without verifying if they were operative even in that state, leave apart its inapplicability in Maharashtra. The authorities' ill actions caused prejudice to the petitioners," the HC held.
