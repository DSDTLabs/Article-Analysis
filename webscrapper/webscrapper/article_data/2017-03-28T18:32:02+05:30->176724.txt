Republic Day 2017 saw a clash of the titans at the box-office with 
 ’s ‘Raees’ and 
 ’s ‘Kaabil’ both releasing on the same day.

 Now, there’s another set of big Bollywood films heading for a mighty clash on the Independence Day weekend. According to an update shared by film trade analyst Taran Adarsh, 
 ’s ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’ will collide with Imtiaz Ali’s Shah Rukh Khan-
  starrer at the box-office. The two films will hit cinemas on August 11, 2017.
 
 
  
  
 Earlier, Akshay Kumar’s ‘Crack’ was scheduled for an Independence Day release and ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’ was to hit the screens on June 2, 2017. Due to production delays, ‘Crack’ will not be releasing this year, and Shah Rukh’s film could have availed a solo release. The change in the release date of Akshay’s film has now slotted the two superstars against each other at the box-office.
 
 Incidentally, last year’s Independence Day weekend had also seen a big clash, between Akshay’s ‘Rustom’ and Hrithik’s ‘Mohenjo Daro’.
