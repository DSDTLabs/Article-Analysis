As e-gadgets become annoying to use, people are bound to go back to print.

  It had to happen. Bandwidths are becoming increasingly sluggish. Signals are low or uneven at best, making for a patchy experience. Batteries never seem to be able to keep up with the needs of the gadget. There is a built-in obsolescence and, consequently, a perennial fear of future incompatibility and permanently losing the conte nts. And to top it all, airlines and security agencies have become annoyingly nit-picking about gizmos. There is clearly a need for an entertainment system that is immune to these banes of the modern, digital era: light, unbreakable, easily portable, with an unlimited “life”, that is, it will not die on the owner at inopportune moments, and also carries a guarantee of permanent non-obsolescence. Something that will not need to be put separately into the scanners at airports or constantly traded up would be very useful too. Funnily enough, that kind of entertainment system has been there for ages. Books.
 
  More and more people appear to have rediscovered these solid virtues of old-fashioned, printed and bound packets of information called books. An outbreak of “screen fatigue” is said to be driving sales of paper editions up, and pulling the plug on e-books in key markets around the world. Of course, the surge in their popularity could also simply be because books are the new arm candy.
