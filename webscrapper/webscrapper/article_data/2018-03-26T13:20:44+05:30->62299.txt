NAGPUR: An unidentified woman Maoist cadre was shot dead in   forest within the limits of Kotmi armed outpost in Etapalli taluka in an encounter with C-60 jawans in south   on Sunday. Police have recovered one 303 rifle and four claymore mines from the place, besides substantial literature of the rebel guerrillas. 

 Police said the C-60 squad was attacked by a Maoist formation, perhaps belonging to the Company 4 unit of the rebels of the banned   (Maoist). The woman cadre was among the ones who got hit in the exchange of fire. According to a senior official, many other cadres may have been injured as blood spots were found at different places. The slain woman cadre’s body will be shifted to Gadchiroli for identification on Monday. 
 
 A Rajaswamy, additional superintendent of police, Gadchiroli, said the operation was based on the inputs the cops received about the presence of Maoists in the forest. “We had received information that the Maoist guerrillas had gathered there to perpetrate an attack on police,” he said. 
 
 Chandu Hichami, a Company 4 unit member, was arrested from Kotgul just a day ago. He was found possessing firearms and a remote control.
