PANAJI: Chief minister  , who is undergoing treatment in the US, on Monday extended the tenure of the cabinet advisory committee ( ) by a month, chief secretary Dharmendra Sharma told TOI. 

 TOI had reported that Parrikar was likely to extend the CAC’s term by Monday. Its terms and conditions remain the same, Sharma said.
 
 The three-member CAC was constituted earlier this year by Parrikar to run the affairs of the state in his absence. It comprises urban development minister Francis D’Souza, PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar and town and country minister Vijai Sardesai. Its term, which was initially till March 31, was later extended to April 30. 
 
 Parrikar recently said that he hoped to return to Goa by the third week of May. “...I am recovering well. My next phase of treatment is starting...” he said in a message to BJP state executive members last week. 
 
 On March 29, Parrikar had increased the financial outlay of each minister from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. He also doubled the CAC’s authority to sanction funds to the tune of Rs 10 crore.
 
 Parrikar, who was diagnosed with pancreatitis, was admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai on February 15. He was discharged after a week and returned to Goa to present the budget on February 21. In early March he was taken to the US for treatment.
