UDUPI: The collection of toll at   on   which was supposed to start from Tuesday midnight, has been postponed for few days owing to stiff opposition by locals. 

 A large number of protesters under the banner   gathered at these toll gates and held   demanding Navayug company officials not to collect toll from Tuesday night. 
 
 Sensing a law and order problem as large number of protesters had gathered at the toll gate, Udupi ASP Vishnuvardhan held talks with Navayug company officials and persuaded them to postpone collection of toll till a meeting with all the stakeholders is held. Following that the company officials decided to keep the decision on hold. 
 
 “We have come to conclusion that a meeting of all the stakeholders will be convened soon and the issue will be debated before starting collection of toll,” ASP told TOI.
 
 Prathap Shetty, president of the committee, said “We had planned a massive protest today but decided against it as the deputy commissioner was out of station. Once he comes back we will take up the issue,’’ he added.
