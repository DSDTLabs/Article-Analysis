None who have watched Nimisha Sajayan’s spectacular performance as a naadan Kerala girl in her debut movie   would have guessed that she is actually a fashionable lass, born and brought up in Mumbai. 

 Nimisha, who played a supermarket employee in the movie in what was her first real attempt at acting, has just wrapped up the shoot of her second movie, Eeda. The film is scripted and directed by debutant Ajith Kumar.
 
 “I play a college student and my character is quite unlike Sreeja in Thondimuthalum… It was exciting to try out a movie and role of another genre and I quite enjoyed it,” says Nimisha, who shares the screen with Kismath fame Shane Nigam in the movie. “For a beginner like me, it was a challenging yet good experience to work with Shane, one of the talented young actors of the industry. I hope I have done my best,” Nimisha says.
 
 Director Ajith Kumar reveals that Nimisha’s character is named Aishwarya, and the movie belongs to the genre of romance. “I wouldn’t make tall claims about it, but Eeda has an interesting story. We had auditioned many actors and was impressed by her work in Thondimuthalum…,” says the director. Shane Nigam’s character is an MBA graduate who works in an entry level managerial post in an insurance company, says Ajith. He is a few years older to Aishwarya and film is about how they meet and what happens afterwards.
 
 Meanwhile, Nimisha says she has settled down for good in Kochi. Does she miss Mumbai? “Actually, no! I am continuing my degree studies in mass communication via correspondence and have made quite a few friends now in Kochi. I also meet Thondimuthalum crew like Dileeshettan, once in a while. Moreover, I have also been busy with the shooting of Eeda. Where is the time to miss Mumbai?” she asks. The actress says she is also listening to a lot of scripts now, and is keen to pick the next challenging role that comes her way.
