NEW DELHI:   scrambled for damage control after party veteran  's comments that   was not yet a mature leader. 

  spokesman   said, "People who have enjoyed the fruits of power for four decades and are held in high esteem by Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi... they should look within themselves before pointing fingers at the Congress leadership."
 
 Looking to distance the party from the controversy, spokesperson Shobha Oza said, "Such comments should be ignored. She (Dikshit) needs to clarify what she has said. Everyone knows Rahul fought for farmers on land acquisition bill and pressured the government to drop any anti-farmer step. He is fighting for the rights of farmers, SCs, STs and poor."
 
 In a clarification of sorts issued by Dikshit with a hashtag DontTwistMyWords, she tweeted, "Rahul has the sensitivity and concern of a mature leader. His words are those of a young, courageous and restless man."
