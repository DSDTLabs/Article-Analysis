PATNA: The Bihar government is considering various options to improve road connectivity to   railway station, which was opened in December 2015. 

 One option is to extend the existing approach road from Bailey Road to Pataliputra Junction up to Digha police station. This road ends at the railway station, but the government is exploring the possibility of converting it into a four-lane stretch of 4.5km to end at Digha police station.
 
 According to sources, at least five proposals are under consideration in this regard. They include developing 27- metre wide roads on the eastern and western sides of Digha- Danapur canal. Other options include development of approach roads connected to Ashiana Nagar, Rajiv Nagar and Digha areas.
 
 State urban development and housing department, road construction department and Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials deliberated the issue at a meeting on Wednesday too. 
 
 “Private lands will have to be acquired to develop approach roads connected to Ashiana Nagar, Rajiv Nagar or Ghurdaur road in Digha area. Besides, inter-departmental land transfers will have to be made to deveop a 27-metre wide road on either side of the Digha-Danapur canal,” a PMC official told TOI after the meeting.
 
 Several trains have been originating from Pataliputra Junction, located at Rupaspur in western Patna, since January last year. However, people have to face hardship as there is only one approach road to the railway station. A petition in this regard has also been filed in the Patna high court.
 
 Pratyush Kumar, a Gopalganj native who stays in Patna’s Ashiana Nagar to pursue studies, complained about the circuitous route he has to take to reach the station.
 
 “Pataliputra Junction is only 2km from my house, but I have to cover a 5-km distance via Bailey Road and Rupaspur as there is no direct road from Ashiana Nagar to Pataliputra Junction,” Pratyush said on Thursday.
