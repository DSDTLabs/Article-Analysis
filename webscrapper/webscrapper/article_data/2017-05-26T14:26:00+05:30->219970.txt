DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand has kicked off an elephant population estimation exercise in 11 forest divisions, including Corbett and   parks. The exercise, which began on Wednesday, will take into account pachyderms spread over an area of 6634.5 sq km across the state.
 
  In the previous such exercise carried out in 2015, the elephant population stood at 1,779. The method that was used was sighting-based. This year, the dung decay method will be used. Uttarakhand had used the dung decay method to count elephant numbers in 2012. Under the method, digital photographs of dung released by elephants were studied using special software on computer in a particular area.
  
  Sanatan Sonkar, director of Rajajai Tiger Reserve, said, “We have deployed 300 people, including forest employees and daily wagers, who will undertake direct sighting, line-transect and dung decay methods for elephant estimation.”
  
  The training of the forest officials who are managing elephant dense reserve forests in both the states was held by scientists   and Surender Verma of Bangalore-based Asian Nature Conservation Foundation of Indian Institute of Science under Project Elephant.
  
  The exercise has begun in   and will be followed by forest divisions in Narendra Nagar, Lansdowne, Corbett Tiger Reserve and all three divisions of Terai. Dhananjai Mohan, additional principal chief conservator of forests, said, “It will take a few months for the results to be compiled.”
