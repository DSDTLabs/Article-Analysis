Over the last couple of years, Mumbai has witnessed a worrying rise in the number of debit card frauds. And, the latest victim of the crime is TV actress  . An amount of Rs 2 lakh was stolen from her bank account, after her debit card was cloned. 

 Adaa recounts, “One morning a few days ago, I got an SMS alert, intimating me of a withdrawal of Rs 24,000 in four transactions. I was shocked and immediately looked for my debit card, which was in my bag. Then, I called the bank’s call centre and by the time I got connected, four more withdrawals had taken place. The person at the call centre said that my card was probably cloned and I blocked it immediately. The cops also told me that this crime is becoming frequent.”
 
 The police is looking into the matter now. “Both the cops and the bank were very cooperative; they are trying to resolve the issue. I had heard about cloning, but we usually take matters lightly as we feel that it’s not going to happen to us. However, it can happen to anyone and one should be aware and alert. I have lost over Rs 2 lakh.”
 
 Now, the actor urges everyone to be careful while using their cards. “The cops and the banks explained the fraud to me and told me to be very careful while using cards anywhere, be it at a restaurant or a petrol pump. The card and your password can be cloned through some machines. I want everyone to be aware of this crime and be careful while using their credit or debit cards. I hope my issue gets resolved soon,” she says.
