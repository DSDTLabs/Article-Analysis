New  : A special CBI   on Friday granted bail to TV actor  , accused in a graft case in connection with which co-accused and senior bureaucrat B K   and his entire family committed suicide last year.

 Special   judge Gurdeep Singh said Saxena had, from time to time, approached the court for anticipatory bail and therefore, it cannot be said he was fleeing from justice. “It is not disputed that the accused is a TV actor and he has stakes in India. Therefore, it is unlikely that he will flee from justice,” said the court, while asking him to furnish a personal bond of Rs 5 lakh, besides two sureties, each of like amount. tnn
