 ‘Stringent rules affecting teacher recruitment’
 
 If the performance of students in north Karnataka is not up to mark, the government and the department of PU Education has to be blamed for it. Unlike in South Karnataka, to a large extent the education sector is catered to by private managements in North Karnataka.
 
 The aided private PU colleges here are suffering due to shortage of teaching staff and the apathy of the PUE department in allowing colleges to fill up vacant posts. “Stringent rules enforced by the department make recruitment of teachers very difficult. In rural areas you cannot expect the students’ strength according to the stipulations of the department. The PUE department, citing lack of workload, is not permitting recruitment of teachers under grant-in-aid and we have to manage with temporary staff paying them meager salaries. It is affecting the quality of teaching,” said the chairman of a private aided educational institution.
