HYDERABAD: Denizens continue to face a severe cash crunch in ATMs despite several efforts by the government to improve the situation.

 “I visited several ATMs, only to be disappointed. I usually do my grocery shopping from a local market, but I am now dependent on online payments to shop. I wish the government had plan things better this year,” Jaya, an SBI ATM user in   said.
 
 IndusInd, Andhra Bank, and State Bank ATMs stand right next to each other at Mehdipatnam, but all three were out of cash for the week.
 
 M K Mouinnudin, a Jet Airways employee also said he failed to find cash in several ATMs. Mohammad Riyad, a travel agent, who was standing in a queue to withdraw money at the Axis   at Bandlaguda said cash is available occasionally.
 
 “I am coming from Hitech city and have visited every ATM on my way. Despite having three bank accounts, I can’t even pay for a tire puncture or my rent. Banks aren’t any help either,” said Nagraj, aworker at  .
 
 The scene seems to be different at the   at Bandlaguda where Sanjeev Reddy, a cop, and  , an Army official said they haven’t faced any problems and that money is available 24/7.
 
 “Because RBI is supplying enough money and people are depositing more money, we are able to fill ATMs with ₹10-15 lakh once a day and that seems to be enough.” said a branch manager, SBI, S Acharya.
