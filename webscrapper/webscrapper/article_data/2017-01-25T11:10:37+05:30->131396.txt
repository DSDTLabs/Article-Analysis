RANCHI:   will not be sending a tableau for the official   in New Delhi this year. A proposal had been sent by the state government in September last year to the Union ministry of defence which curates a list of tableaux to represent states across the nation. However, despite six rounds of discussions with the ministry,   will not be present in the parade. 

 Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary to the chief minister and chief secretary of   said, "We had put forward a proposal to depict Itkhori in Jharhand's tableau but the proposal was declined despite several attempts on our behalf. The reason possibly is Centre's efforts to rotate the states which are represented and Jharkhand has been continuously represented in the past few years."
 
 Itkhori holds archaeological importance of being situated in Hazaribag district. There are several Buddhist stupas here and it is believed that Gautam Buddha had visited his aunt here. Jharkhand's tableau, which showcased the heritage of the Maluti Temples at the 2015 Republic Day parade, had won the second prize that year.
