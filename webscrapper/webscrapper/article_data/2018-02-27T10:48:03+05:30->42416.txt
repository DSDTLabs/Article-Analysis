LUCKNOW: UP   organising secretary Sanjay Dikshit said on Monday that Naseenuddin   would be used as a weapon by the   to target Congress. 

 Dikshit, along with UPCC secretary Awadesh Singh, has been served a notice by the party for protesting against the joining of former BSP minister Siddiqui into the Congress.
 
 In his response to the notice, Dikshit said he was not objecting to Siddiqui's joining but that the former BSP member did not either fit in with the party's principles nor was his behaviour such that he should be allowed to join the party. "At one level, party president   suspended Mani Shankar Aiyer for calling the PM "neech" (low caste) and on another level, Siddqui is being given primary membership of the party even though he publically made a comment against BJP leader Dayashankar Singh's family. 
 
 Dikshit was referring to a 2016 protest by BSP in Lucknow where Siddqui had called for the daughter and sisters of expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh to be presented before the protesters. 
 
 By inducting Siddiqui, the commander of  's loot, we are raising this issue again. BJP will make him a weapon and attack   with it," Dikshit said. Dikshit said Siddiqui is not trustworthy as he reportedly got Mayawati's phone tapped when he was within the party. He further said that Rahul Gandhi had allowed his entry into the party because he had not been given a correct picture about him by some other party members.
