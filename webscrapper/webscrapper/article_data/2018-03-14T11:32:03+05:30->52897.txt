JAIPUR: When solutions to a problem develop the same problems, what do we do? Bring in a bigger solution, a comprehensive one. But if it is a government entity, then just relax and chill out because the responsibility does not rest on a single head, it’s diversified. And also, there is always a bailout package in order if push comes to a shove.

 Currently, Rajasthan   seems to be in the throes of such a situation. More than a couple of years ago, PDCOR was appointed to restructure the operations of   and turn around the loss making corporation so that the ultimate aim of its disinvestment can be achieved.
 
 Thereafter, a series of measures were initiated to rein in the losses. One of the two main decisions was to sell and lease out the hotels, and if some properties do not attract investors’ interest, then let the RTDC run them. And the second decision was to send the RTDC staff employed in hotels on reverse deputation.
 
 While 15 hotels were identified and closed down, the selling process is yet to start. Along with it, over 400 staff from across its properties (27 operational out of 75) have been sent on reverse deputation. But the vaunted objective of reducing losses has become more challenging than before.
 
 Despite the ongoing restructuring, losses clocked by RTDC has only ballooned. In the past four years, losses have almost doubled, shooting up from Rs 83.61 crore in 2012-13 to Rs 154 crore in 2016-17.
 
 The performance of its two key verticals, hotels and luxury trains (see box), is on a steady decline. Rather, it has been precipitated in the past three years. Occupancy in the hotels which used to hover around 33-35% between 2008-09 and 2013-14, has come down to around 23% in 2016-17.
 
 “The decline is not entirely due to market forces. It is a calculated strategy the government, which wants to give these properties to private players in the name of restoring the financial   of the corporation. The higher loss the hotels make make, the bigger reason the government will have to justify their sale,” confided an employee, preferring anonymity.
 
 A top official of the corporation admitted that it’s difficult to manage the ever-mounting debt. One of the main demands of the employees is to extend them the benefits of 7th Pay Commission. But the official said the corporation simply does not have resources to do that.
 
 “Even we cannot pay arrears to employees who are retiring. It’s a tough situation to be in. Selling and giving properties on lease are the only options left before us. These properties served well when there were not many hotels. But now the dynamics has changed. So we have to change with time,” he added.
 
 But the selling and leasing out process has hit a roadblock putting the whole restructuring plan in disarray. As per   Tourism Disposal of Land and Properties by DoT, RTDC Rules 1997, RTDC will get only 15% of proceeds from the sale of assets. 
 
 “If RTDC gets only 15% of the sale proceeds, the aim to improve the financial health of the corporation will not be achieved. We are talking to the government to increase the ratio in favour of the corporation. This is actually stalling the sale and leasing out exercise,” added the official.
 
 After coming to power, the current government made an attempt to reinvent and revamp RTDC and talked about its disinvestment. It’s now at the fag-end of its tenure which is likely to stop the exercise in its tracks. Meanwhile, what it would leave behind is a bad situation made worse.
