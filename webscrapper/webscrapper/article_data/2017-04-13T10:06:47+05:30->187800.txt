PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   (PCMC) will introduce face-reading and biometric attendance system for its employees and those working for contractors at municipal properties by the next month.

 The civic administration received the directives at a review meet of health, drainage and other civic departments.
 
 Seema Savale, chairperson, PCMC standing committee told TOI, “A thumb-impression based biometric attendance system is already in place. But some employees have complained that the machines do not register their thumb imprints resulting in loss of salary even if they have worked for the day. This could be due to the fading of fingerprints of these employees. Face-reading devices can fix this issue.”
 
 Savale also said that opening a biometric and   system for the employees working under contractors will help in transparent functioning. “PCMC appoints contractors for security and maintenance at crematoriums, gardens and other civic properties. However, it is found that a lesser number of workers are actually employed at these spots. The involved parties earn huge profits out of this but the citizens get deficient service,” he said.
 
 Neelkanth Poman, chief information and technology officer, PCMC told TOI, “We have installed biometric attendance systems at all civic office buildings. However, we need to cover the staff working on the field too. Our first priority is to provide the facility to our sanitation staff. Later, we will cover the others on field duty.”
 
 Savale said, “Instructions have been given to the health department to start the cleaning of big nullahs from May 1, so that the work is complete before the onset of monsoon.”
 
 Mininath Dandavate, zone B officer and additional chief of health department told TOI, “We have started the cleaning of 28 small nullahs in zone B limits.” 
 
 Bids have been invited for the cleaning of two big nullahs in the area, he said.
