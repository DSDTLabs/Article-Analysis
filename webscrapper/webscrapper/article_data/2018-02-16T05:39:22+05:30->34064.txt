MUMBAI: Markets regulator   said on Thursday that retail investors who participate in initial public offers (IPOs) and are eligible to receive shares, should be compensated monetarily if merchant bankers fail to allot shares to them. In addition, the merchant bankers to the offers will also need to pay an interest of 15% to those investors if the bankers fail to resolve their grievance within 15 days.

 Putting in place a framework to compensate retail investors who fail to get securities in an  , Sebi said there should be a uniform policy for calculation of minimum compensation payable to investors.
 
 While calculating minimum compensation, several factors need to be taken into account — like opportunity loss suffered by the investor due to non-allotment of shares, number of times the issue was oversubscribed in the relevant category, probability of allotment, and listing gains (if any) on the day of listing. “It is also proposed that in case of issues which are subscribed between 90-100% — that is non-oversubscribed issues — the applicants would be compensated for all the shares which they would have been allotted,” Sebi noted. However, no compensation would be payable in case the listing price is below the issue price, it said in a circular, which would come into force with immediate effect.
 
 While the process of Applications Supported By Block Amount ( ) has resulted in almost complete elimination of complaints pertaining to refunds, Sebi said there have been instances where IPO applicants have failed to get allotment.
