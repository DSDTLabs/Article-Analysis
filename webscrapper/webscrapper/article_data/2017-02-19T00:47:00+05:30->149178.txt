 The raid was carried out on the instructions of SP (ACB), Kota, Kiran Kang.
 
 The stock and daily inspection register was not proper and updated. There were hardly one or two inspections in a month. When the   interrogated junior engineer, diesel, and manager (operations), they could not provide a satisfactory reply on the stock availability report at the depot.
