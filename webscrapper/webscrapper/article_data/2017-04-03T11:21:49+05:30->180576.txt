PANAJI: During the academic year 2016-17, 463 out-of-school children have been identified across the state and 51 of these children are expected to be introduced to   after providing them training. Most of these out-of-school children belonged to migrant workers from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and Bihar, state officials said. 

 Goa carried out an extensive exercise to identify out-of-school children during 2016-17, under the   (SSA) programme, involving workers of SSA, anganwadi and those from the directorate of  . So far, under SSA, a total of 1,676 students have been enrolled in regular schools and 1,777 children with special needs were enrolled in 25 special schools across Goa.
 
 Officials associated with the Union human resource development ministry have set a target for Goa that there will be no out-of-school children found in the state by 2019. The state government has been advised that all children enrolled as out-of-school children be given a unique ID (preferably Aadhar number wherever available), so that all these children are enrolled in regular schools after providing them special training, and once these children are mainstreamed, they are not enrolled in SSA special training centers again.
 
 With a thriving tourism sector and flourishing construction activity in the state, Goa attracts a large number of migrant labourers. A large number of such families are part of a floating population that moves in and out of Goa depending on the availability of work. This leads to difficulties in bringing children of these workers to mainstream  .
 
 Goa was allotted Rs 33.65 lakh by the central government in 2016-17 for special training for coverage of 2,205 out-of-school children (those identified during the current academic year, as well as those not mainstreamed, but identified previously).
