KOLKATA: Slapping charges against its state president Dilip Ghosh has come as a shot in the arm for the BJP to upscale the “minority appeasement“ charge against the   government, claimed state BJP leaders.

 “This is one more instance after Dhulagarh and Kaliachak where the government has exposed its double face. I will wait till Muharram to see if this government can stop the armed processions on city streets,“ said state BJP leader Rahul Sinha. The party's state unit plans a no-holds-barred campaign on this issue till Union home minister   comes down to Kolkata on April 14, and party president Amit Shah on April 25.
 
 Visibly happy with the “spontaneous assertion of the Hindu identity“ in Bengal on Wednesday , the state BJP has its eyes fixed on the 2019   poll. “It shows the majo rity community is aghast with Mamata Banerjee's double standards -her announcing honorarium for imams and muajjins. The Ram Navami show has shaken the Trinamool chief. She was having smooth ride capitalising on the divided opposition vote. Now that CPM and Congress stand marginalised, Banerjee is scared,“ Sinha said.
 
 Encouraged with the party's progress among the adivasis in north Bengal, the state BJP now plans to replicate the north Bengal model in south Bengal where Banerjee enjoys a near monopoly. The state's deteriorating law and order stands foremost in the BJP agenda apart from the various scams from Saradha to Narada. “Our leaders and ministers will reach out to all the LS constituencies telling people about the state's failure in all fronts -law and order, health and education. Bengal has become a happy haven for Jamiat jihadis,“ the BJP leader said.
 
 Like in  , the Bengal BJP claims to have made dents among the scheduled castes and tribes in Jangalmahal and also has earned the confidence of Muslim women on the triple talaq issue. “It has unnerved Banerjee. That is why she has been harping on her Hindu identity,“ the BJP leader said.
