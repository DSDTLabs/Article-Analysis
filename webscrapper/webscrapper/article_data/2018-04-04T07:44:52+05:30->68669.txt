MANALI: Peace parleys between the protesting   and the project management failed to resolve the issue on the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Members of the negotiating committee of workers’ union met with the company officials on Tuesday, but they alleged that officials refused to fulfill any of their demand.

 The indefinite strike at   tunnel project entered the seventh day on Tuesday. Their talks with the management had failed on Monday, after only five worker representatives were allowed to meet them. On Tuesday, police and local administration officials arranged a meeting between the two parties, but the talks failed to broker peace. 
 
 Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, Rohtang Tunnel Project, president Dharmender Singh said members of the negotiating committee from workers’ union met the officials of Strabag Afcons but not a single demand was accepted. “We are surprised that even the Border Roads Organization is not helping resolve the dispute. The project manager is out of station. We shall now talk only with him. Till then the agitation will continue and workers will not resume work,” he said.
 
 Alleging cruelty to workers, Singh said, “Workers have dinner at 6pm and come out of the tunnel at 7am. We want a change in work timings. Foreign officials of the company have no knowledge about our labour laws, and Indian officials say contractors’ workers will not be brought under labour law. We want labour laws to be applied on each and every worker.” 
 
 The excavation work of the 8.8km-long Rohtang tunnel was completed last year and it now needs finishing work before it is thrown open to vehicular traffic. The tunnel is expected to be ready by 2019, after having been delayed by over three years.
