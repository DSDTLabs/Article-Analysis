GURUGRAM: Talking about   may still be a taboo but the demand for sex   is on the rise in cities — including Gurgaon and Noida — as well as small towns, a survey has revealed.

 The countrywide survey by adult products selling startup, ThatsPersonal.com, is based on analysis of more than six million visitors, some 80,000 orders and approximately 8,700 customer interactions over the past four years.
 
 According to the survey, Mumbai is on top when it comes to purchasing sex toys, while Delhi comes a close second. However, the national capital region, which includes Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida, overtakes Mumbai with 9% higher sales overall and 13% more traffic.
 
 In fact, Gurgaon is a big buyer of adult games, second only to Ahmedabad. Around 4% of all orders for naughty gifts comes from the Millennium City. On the other hand, most orders for penis enlargement products were placed from Noida, according to the survey. 
 
 The survey also found that more women order adult products in Tier 2 cities like Baroda, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram. In terms of age group, people between 25 and 34 years revisit the portal more. On the other hand, those between 18 and 24 years usually opt for self-pick-up of their orders, according to the survey.
 
 February is the month when the portal records the highest sales in the year — due to Valentine’s Day. The excitement, however, seems to ebb rather quickly with March accounting for the lowest sales.
 
 According to ThatsPersonal.com, the size of the erotica accessories market in India is expected to cross Rs 10,000 crore by 2020. “These interesting learnings coming from our data mining and analytics which we thought would be fun to share with our fellow Indians. We find the market rapidly growing as couples have shed their inhibitions and are open to experiment and try out new products,” Samir Saraiya, CEO of ThatsPersonal.com, told TOI.
