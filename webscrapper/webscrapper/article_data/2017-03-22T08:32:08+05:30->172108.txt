 State not getting Ravi-Beas water: Water resources minister Rampratap admitted in the house that Punjab was not releasing Rajasthan’s entire share of water as per the Ravi-Beas agreement of 1960. BJP MLA  , while raising the matter during question hour, said during the early stages of   canal’s construction, Rajasthan was allotted 8.6 MAF water out of the available 17 MAF. “Since the canal was in early stages of construction, it was decided to release only 8 MAF, while 0.6 MAF was to be released later,” Patel said.
 
 Minister Rampratap said the government was trying to get Rajasthan’s remaining share.
