Singer   is no stranger to Gurgaon. The Delhi boy has been coming to the city since before he even became a singer, and used to assist in his family's construction business. Even as a singer, he has performed in the venues on   and   several times. But earlier this month, he had his first experience of shooting in the city, when he shot a promo for a TV show he is doing along with   and   at a car showroom in Sector 37. Indeep says that it was then that he realized how perfect Gurgaon is for music videos. 

  
  
 
 The singer says, "I shot for a promo of a show, called ' ', in Gurgaon earlier this month. The place is amazing. It was my first experience of shooting in the city. The other day I was in Cyber Hub, and if you look at that place, it is perfect for a music video. I will surely shoot a music video here soon. Indian artists donâ€™t need to go abroad to look for swanky locations for videos when we have places like these right here, in Delhi and Gurgaon. Not just Cyber Hub, but Gurgaon has so many places and properties that are just at par with international spots."
