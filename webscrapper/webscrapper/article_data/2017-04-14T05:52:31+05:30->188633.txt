CALANGUTE: Following complaints from beach shack operators holding valid licences, a few illegal beach   were razed at   by the tourism department while the code of conduct was in force. But, those who do business legally, claim that every time an unlicensed shack is demolished, it reappears in the exact same spot. 

 Sources say there are at least 20 illegal beach shacks along the   tourist belt. 
 
 “When we complained, the tourism department demolished a couple of shacks just to show it’s taking action, but the operators started rebuilding them the same evening,” a beach shack owner said.
 
 Tourism director  , said that following complaints, drives were conducted and three illegal shacks were dismantled.
