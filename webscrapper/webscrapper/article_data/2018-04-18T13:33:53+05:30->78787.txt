SURAT: A social activist has registered a police complaint against a multiplex cinema located in city’s   area for preventing him and his family members from carrying water bottles and outside food inside the hall on Tuesday. 

 Sanjay Ezhawa was stopped from carrying water bottles and outside food inside the cinema hall by the management of   multiplex when he had gone to watch a movie with his family on March 31. Ezhawa had circulated the video on the social media platforms where he repeatedly asked the managements to allow him with outside food as he is a diabetic and cannot eat junk food. 
 
 Ezhawa has lodged the complaint at Adajan police against the manager of   and other staff members under Section 339 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for wrongful restraint and obstructing him from proceeding to the theatre. 
 
 The member of Society For Citizen Centric Governance (SCCG) has taken up the campaign ‘My Food, My Movie’ to exhort moviegoers to carry their own food and water bottles inside the theatre. 
 
 SCCG president   told TOI, “We want the city police to take action against the multiplex for wrongful restraint . There is no law where cinema halls can prevent viewers from carrying outside food. ”
 
 When contacted, Cinepolis manager   said he has left the job. Iyer’s subordinate Proloy told TOI, “I am not aware of the police complaint. You contact our head office for further information.” A police officer said, “We have received a complaint against Cinepolis under the IPC Section 339. The station officer will be carrying out investigation and book the guilty as per the law.” tnn
