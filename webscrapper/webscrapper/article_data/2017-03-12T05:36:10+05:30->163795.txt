HYDERABAD: It’s that time of the year again when the city springs alive to usher in the festival of colours. But along with the traditional gulal and water balloons, the celebrations this year will also include high decibel parties complete with   (EDM), free bhang and lip-smacking food. The ‘hottest’ destination: Hyderabad’s upscale IT corridor. 

 Beginning Sunday, a series of   parties are set to unfold in areas like Madhapur, Hi-Tec City and Gachibowli. Hundreds are expected to pour into the IT corridor to indulge in rain dances, enjoy live dhol performances and engage in water guns/balloon fights. Of course, it’ll all come for a price — anywhere between Rs 399 and Rs 3,999 per person. The high rate-card notwithstanding, organisers are certain of a heavy footfall at all their venues. 
 
 “The party culture has become very popular in Hyderabad over the past few years. This is now reflecting in the Holi celebrations as well. This year, Holi is being celebrated with a videsi tadka as EDM music has made its way into these parties,” said Priyanka Ganeriwal, an event manager. 
 
 Such is the craze among revellers that some party organisers have thrown in special attractions like customised merchandise for those joining in the celebrations. A few have even signed up DJs and peppered their event list with mud dance and ‘tomatino festival’. 
 
 “Since it’s a weekend, it works in the favour of several revellers who want to party,” said Vikram Muday, an event organiser who is upbeat about the turnout this festival season.
