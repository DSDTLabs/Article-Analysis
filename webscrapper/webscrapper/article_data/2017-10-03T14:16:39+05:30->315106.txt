CHENNAI: There will be a new entrant soon among a host of politically-sponsored television news channels in Tamil Nadu. The ruling AIADMK camp led by Edappadi K   is planning to start a television news channel and newspaper to propagate the party's ideals and publicise the achievements of the government. The AIADMK mouthpiece Namadhu MGR and   are now under the control of the   clan, focussing on news and developments "favourable" to the family.

 The move for an in-house TV channel and newspaper gained momentum in the wake of the Palaniswami government garnering negative publicity in Namadhu MGR and Jaya TV . "Palaniswami has set up a team led by trusted ministers S P Velumani and P Thangamani to work out the 'media' strategy . More than 10 names have been discussed but noth ing has been finalized yet given the developments in recent days," said a senior minister, seeking anonymity. The group is very keen to have MGR and Amma in the name of the entities to carry forward the legacy of the former chief ministers and to strike a chord among the cadre. Talks are on for applying for new licenses.
 
 The need to have an inhouse media is widely felt among the rank and file of the faction. But, a firm call would be taken only after the election commission decides on the two leaves dispute, the hearing for which has been scheduled for October 6. The move was first mooted by O Panneerselvam himself ahead of the high-profile merger with the Palaniswami faction in August. Party sources said Tamil official language and culture minister K Pandiarajan, a senior leader in the   camp, was given the task of preparing a report on the logistics of launching a news channel. The plan, however, did not take off.
