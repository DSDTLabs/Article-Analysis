PANAJI: The Xavier Afonso Memorial Institute’s Royale High School,  , has started initiating action against its staff members who were involved in hatching a conspiracy of filing false complaints against the headmistress of the school in order to malign the reputation of the institution.

 Headmistress  , who was chargesheeted for alleged child abuse, has been discharged by the   for lack of evidence in the case. A statement issued by the management expressed ‘confidence and faith in the sincerity and integrity of Mariazita Afonso, who with her hard work achieved   for the last three consecutive years’. The management of the school also stated that some disgruntled parents, in connivance with some teachers, had filed the false criminal complaint.
 
 A complaint was filed by a minor boy in March 14, 2014, and registered the next day, alleging that the headmistress called his mother a liar, made statements about his sister’s character and assaulted him.
 
 The Goa children’s court, in its order, has stated that the contents of the complaint are not fully supported by the statement of the victim boy and the complaint does not reveal the date the offence was allegedly committed.
 
 There are around four letters from other parents complaining about the harassment of their children by the headmistress, but the court stated that “none of the letters referred, including the complaint, carries any details, including the date or time of the so called offence of child abuse”. “Even in the supplementary statement of the complaint recorded by the investigating officer on March 15, 2014, there is no exact date, place and time of the abuse caused,” the court stated, adding that there is no specific offence seen prima facie made out with reference to the particular date, time or place.
