HYDERABAD: Scores of Indian workers in   are in dire straits and have literally been brought to the streets because the firm they were employed with has not paid them.

 The workers, who hail from different states in India, have got court verdicts in their favour but their company   has refused to pay them. “We are unable to survive here and cannot go back to India without our salaries. Life has become difficult,” said one worker. The workers have sent videos, shot on the streets, expressing their anguish to TOI.
 
 One of the workers said the company owed him ₹8 lakh and his family back home needs the money to pay tuition fees for his children and house rent. “How are our families expected to survive back home?” the worker asked and broke into tears explaining his own difficult situation in Saudi Arabia.
  
  
 Groups of Indian workers aired their grievances in the videos, some describing how they are starving in Saudi Arabia and pleading for help. The videos were sent to TOI by one Imtiaz, also an employee of Electro Industries, Jeddah.
 
 While most protesting workers are employed by Electro Industries, in one video, a worker from Bihar, mentions that some belong to other companies too and they also have been deprived of salaries.
 
 In a letter to the   in  , social worker   said 83 employees had got a favourable verdict from the labour court which had also ordered the employer to make their full and final settlement and send them to India.
 
 Responding to the letter, the Indian Embassy asked for contact numbers of aggrieved workers “to enable us to talk to them and help them out". Protector General of Emigrants (PGE) M C Luther, who also responded to a plea by Shaheen on twitter, on Tuesday asked for more details to be sent about stranded Indian workers.
