NEW DELHI: School of Open Learning students at   are planning to   against the college administration on Wednesday for posting a “highly misogynistic notice” against   women students. They claimed several students have been turned out of the college for speaking up against   rules. 

 Students have complained that a notice was put up forbidding SOL students from sitting on the lawns, clicking selfies and combing their hair in the corridors, calling it a “waste of time”. The notice has since then been removed. 
 
 The principal of the school, however, claimed it was an unsigned notice. “Yes, there was an incident where a student perched dangerously on a parapet was asked by a teacher to be careful. But suddenly I’m being asked about a certain notice, which I saw is unsigned,” said Pratibha Jolly. She said authorities would never stop a student from using mobile phones, especially because the college is actively involved in the propagation of digital technology. “We have a floating population. If something happens, the authorities will be held responsible. It was a word of caution,” she said. 
 
 However, students claim they have been “terrorized” by guards and coordinators who snatch away their phones and send back home those without IDs.
