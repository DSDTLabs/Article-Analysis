Lucknow: Chief Judicial Magistrate Sandhya Srivastava rejected final report of police in connection with La Martiniere student   death case. The   also directed police to make further investigation in the case and submit report. The court directed to probe into the matter for offences of murder, conspiracy and attempt to remove evidence.

 The   directed Gautampali police SHO to probe from where the investigation had concluded. The order came following an application filed by Rahul’s brother Rohit Kumar in which he demanded the final report submitted by police on October 11, 2015 be set aside and police probe further to nail the truth.
 
 The applicant’s counsel Pranshu Agrawal argued the police had not conducted fair probe in many respects and alleged that police investigated on the basis of wrong facts. “The role of college administration after the incident indicated conspiracy,” said the applicant and demanded scientific and thorough investigation of the case. It was argued the injuries on the body were not because of falling from height. Rohit also said handwriting on the alleged suicide note was different from Rahul’s. It was further said that if college administration had provided timely medical aid Rahul’s life could have been saved.
 
 CJM said call and SMS details of the deceased were not collected by police. “It would be expedient to make further probe on the points raised in the protest application,” said the court.
