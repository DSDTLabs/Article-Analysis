AHMEDABAD: With the Union budget for 2017-18 to be presented on Wednesday, Gujarat’s industrial players expect the Union finance minister will announce measures aimed at boosting demand in various industrial sectors.

 Sectors such as real estate, textiles, plastics, chemicals, engineering and ceramics etc, are currently facing slowdown after demonetisation dampened demand. “The government should announce budgetary measures to maximize demand in the domestic market,” said  , president,   (GCCI).
 
 “A host of industrial units are still operating at 40%-50% capacity. For example, chemical industry has lost sizeable overseas market to  . These industries need government support to revive demand,” he added.
 
 Industry players believe that the government should take steps to bring down the cost of power, which will help local industrial units remain competitive in the international market. “Our overseas counterparts get power at Rs 3-4 per unit, while we pay Rs 7.50 per unit. It becomes difficult to compete with them as power tariffs raise our cost by 10%-15%,” Patel said.
 
 “There needs to be greater allocation for infrastructure projects. Also, a simplification of procedures for encouraging startups to avail schemes announced for the sector is required,” added K T Patel, vice-president, GCCI.
