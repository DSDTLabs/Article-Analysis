TIRUNELVELI: Convener of the People’s Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) SP Udayakumar has said that they will move the apex court based on the CAG report pointing out flaws in the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) project.

 “We were discussing it with senior lawyer   in this regard. Once the SC judges issue settles we will legally approach the power plant issue,” he said and added that they would also fight the cases pending against more than a lakh anti-KKNPP protesters.
 
 Udayakumar said that they had approached some political leaders in the state including MPs and MLAs with the CAG report and sought their support to raise it in the assembly and parliament. “We were told that independent MLAs TTV Dhinakaran and   tried to raise it in the assembly but were stopped,” he added. The activist also alleged that the administration did not want to reveal the actual population within a radius of 30 kms from KKNPP. “We have been waiting for 6 months to get a reply from collectors of   and Kanyakumari districts,” he said.
