PORVORIM: Deputy speaker and   Michael Lobo said it is unjust that a petition has been filed against him, declaring his election null and void, even though he won the February 4 assembly polls against former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira.   had contested on a   ticket.

 Sequeira has now filed a writ petition before the high court of Bombay at Goa, with a prayer to declare Lobo’s election null and void on the grounds of alleged corrupt practices by Lobo. Sequeira wants the results to be declared wrong on the grounds that there was improper and illegal recording of votes by the electronic voting machine (EVM), and that there was neither recounting available nor verification of votes, by the voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT).
 
 Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Lobo said “It is ridiculous that I have been made a respondent in the petition even though I was elected by a margin of 4,000 votes.”
