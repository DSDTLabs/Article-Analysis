TRICHY: All the 88 girl inmates of the   childrenâ€™s home in   on Monday refused to comply with the order of the   bench of the   by locking themselves up in the home when officials went there to shift them to a home identified by the Trichy district administration.

 A team led by district social welfare officer (DSWO) S Usha went to the Mose Ministries home in Renga Nagar at Subramaniapuram in the morning to shift the inmates to the new home as directed by the high court. However, the inmates locked themselves up inside the home preventing the officials from executing the court order. 
 
 The inmates refused to move to another home by saying that they had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court order. The officials returned after an hour-long effort to convince them. The officials informed Trichy district collector K Rajamani about it.
 
 The home has been controlled by the district social welfare officer for more than a year following the court order to evict the administration led by Pastor Gideon Jacob from there. The home administration led by Jacob had violated the norms since girls had been kept on the unauthorised premises for nearly two decades.
 
 In fact, a special original petition filed by the inmates of the Mose Ministries seeking freedom led a bench of Justices TS Sivagnanam and P Velmurugan to pass the order to move them to a new home. The court had observed that the demand of the 88 girls to be freed from the Mose Ministries home was a valid one.
 
 The parents of three girls from Usilampatti area in Madurai also visited the home on Monday. They demanded that their children be sent with them. However, their emotional appeal failed to yield any result.
