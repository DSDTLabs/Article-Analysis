CHANDIGARH: In a relief to patients and their families, the construction work of a   storage facility for a pharmaceutical centre in   has kicked off. The proposed   will be run directly by the hospital and in the absence of a middleman, there will be no profit margins on medicines.

 The storage facility was approved three years ago and was supposed to be functional by March this year, however, the work got stalled.
 
 The store will offer 50% discount on most of the medicines, including branded and non-branded products. The tender for the drug store has been allotted this month.
 
 “The construction work was stopped in between due to some issues and we had to float the tender again. Now, we hope that the pharmacy will operate by the end of this year,” said Dr  , chairman of the pharmacy project.
 
 The plan is to set up an affordable pharmacy, and if this one proves to be a success model, other such stores would be set up at cardiac and trauma centres as well. The medicines will be procured directly from the manufacturers which will lower the cost and offer more than 50% discount, added Rajwanshi.
 
 “This store will be the first of its kind in the city. All medicines and consumables will be bought in bulk directly by the institute and sold to the patients without any profit margins,” said a PGI faculty member.
 
 The Rs 15-crore project has been delayed by three years. The patients who had been waiting for the availability of affordable medicines at PGI can now heave a sigh of relief.
