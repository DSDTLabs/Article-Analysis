HYDERABAD: A day before the budget session of the state Legislative Assembly begins, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao predicted that his party, if elections were to be held today, had the prospects of winning 106 seats of the total 119 MLA seats. However, even as he informed the TRS legislature party members this bit of information based on two surveys, he also handed out to his party leaders the findings of the twin surveys that are expected to jolt some of his party legislators into action in their constituencies. 

 In his remarks, Chandrasekhar Rao informed his flock that the surveys were comprehensive and the party now had detailed information on the performance of each MLA. In Medak district, of all the MLAs, the chief minister scored the highest approval rating of 96.7% in the second survey, an improvement from 75.7 in the first. The second spot in the district was taken by minister   who found an approval rating of 82.3% in the second survey after the first gave him 60.9% approval rating.
 
 Incidentally, in   district that has the constituencies of principal opposition leaders,   president N Uttam Kumar Reddy (Huzurnagar) and leader of the Opposition in the Assembly K   (Nagarjunasagar), the surveys showed Uttam Kumar's ratings drop from 79.2% to 53.7%. On the other hand, Jana Reddy's ratings rose from 45.7% to 63.2%.
 
 The TRS chief called on his party leaders to take part enthusiastically in the party membership drive to be launched in the next few days. While all the MLAs and MLCs were called on to conduct themselves with dignity during the session, the chief minister was particular that no one should reach the Assembly or Council late. Ministers were told that they should arrive about half an hour ahead of the beginning of each day's session.
