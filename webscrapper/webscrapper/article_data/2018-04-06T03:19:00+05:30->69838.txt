Vasco: The Supreme Court order permitting export of ore mined before March 16 has come as a relief to Goa Barge Owners Association (GBOA), said the president of the association Raymond D’Sa. The order has ensured that the industry has some business for the next two months, D’Sa said, adding that they are hopeful that the government will initiate steps to auction mining leases soon. Just like the government came to the rescue of bar licences post the SC order banning sale of liquor along highways and stopped thousands from losing their source of income, D’Sa said they hope the government does the same for them. “Our industry also employs many,” he said. tnn
