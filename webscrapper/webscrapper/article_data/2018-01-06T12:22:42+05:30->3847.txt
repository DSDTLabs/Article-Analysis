PATNA: Patna   (PU) colleges and postgraduate departments will undertake green auditing of their respective campuses with a view to promoting energy conservation. Efforts will be made to minimize the use of energy by using LED bulbs and installing solar energy panels on different buildings.

 The decision was taken at a meeting of the principals and   programme coordinators of different colleges on Friday under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor  . It was decided that all the colleges and different wings of PU would soon install solar energy panels and save money on power consumption. 
 
 It was also decided that all the colleges would hold at least one special cleanliness camp of NSS volunteers for keeping their campus clean and green. Dustbins of different shades would be kept on the campus to collect different types of waste in separate bins. Plant leaves would not be burned, rather they would be used for making vermicompost. 
 
 A status report on the functioning of Wi-Fi installations in different institutions was also sought from different colleges and the problems were discussed in detail with the officials concerned, who were present at the meeting. It was decided that all the problems of power supply and connectivity would be solved at the earliest. 
 
 PU pro-vice-chancellor  , registrar   and proctor   also attended the meeting.
