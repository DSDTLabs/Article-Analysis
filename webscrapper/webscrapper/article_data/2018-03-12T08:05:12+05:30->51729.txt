SHILLONG: The remaining members of   National Liberation Army (GNLA), the militant outfit suspected to be behind the killing of   candidate Jonathone Sangma last month, will surrender before police on Monday. The outfit's chief,  , was killed in a police operation last month.

 The cadre - Klubirth Sangma (alias Keke), Chonbirth Ch Marak, Rahul S Sangma (aka Nikam), Sujit G Momin (aka Roben), Hendison M Sangma (aka Newak), Barningstone S Sangma (alias William), Thangkam Ch Momin (alias Bilwat) and Pinbil Ch Marak (aka Churik) - gave themselves up at Akelgre village, 8km from Williamnagar in East Garo Hills, on Sunday. The group had two AK-56 rifles, an INSAS rifle, SMG, .22 air rifle and .22 pistol among a huge cache of arms and ammunition, police said.
 
 "They got in touch with police for the surrender. The official surrender will be held at the police headquarters in the state capital on Monday," Ringrang Momin, SP of East Garo Hills, said. The surrender will take place in the presence of home minister James Sangma.
 
 Formed in 2010 by a senior police officer to seek a sovereign Garoland, the rebel group operated in the three districts of the Garo Hills. It was declared a terror outfit by the Union home ministry in 2012.
 
 Just as it was thought to be depleting in strength, Jonathone was killed on February 18, days before the polls. Less than a week later, the GNLA chief was shot in a police encounter at Achakpek in East Garo Hills district. The eight remaining rebels had managed to flee.
