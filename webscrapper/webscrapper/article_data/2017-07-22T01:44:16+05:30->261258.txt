NEW DELHI: The Delhi high   Friday asked Le   hotel if it was paying   fee in accordance with the court’s earlier order.

 The high court was hearing a plea on New Delhi Municipal Council’s plan to ask the hotel to vacate the premises. Appearing on behalf of the civic agency, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain informed Justice Sunil Gaur that NDMC has already begun the eviction proceedings against the hotel and urged the court to allow it.
 
 However, the hotel maintained that its agreement with the agency inked in 2015 should be followed and any licence dispute must be settled as per those conditions. The additional solicitor general alleged that the hotel has failed to pay revenues because of which the civic body has difficulty in discharging its duties. He further opposed any plea to recognize the 2015 settlement, terming it a fraudulent one.
 
 Justice Gaur then posted the case for next week and asked the hotel to inform in what manner it is paying licence fee. The HC is hearing a plea by NDMC to permit it to remove the hotel from the premises after the agency cancelled its licence last year.
 
 In its plea, NDMC wants the high court to modify its May 2001 order where the court had stopped it from taking coercive action against the hotel. It has argued that the 2001 order was conditional on the hotel paying its licence dues but since it had failed to do so, NDMC must be permitted to initiate proceedings to evict CJ International, which is the current owner, from the hotel.
 
 On March 2, NDMC had decided to auction the Taj Mansingh hotel and also cancelled Le Meridien’s licence over dues of Rs 523 crore. The agency has alleged that the Le Meridien property is unauthorised and said its council cancelled the licence as the alleged compromise in the high court was termed a fraud.
