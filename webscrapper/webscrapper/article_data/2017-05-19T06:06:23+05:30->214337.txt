VADODARA: Did you know that you are not supposed to honk when you pass from the Jail Road or on the Mandvi-Panigate Road as they are silence zones? Thousands of commuters pass from these roads in the city but most are not aware about the no-honking rules introduced by the police department. The cops have issued seven notifications and notified nine areas as silence zones in the city. 

 “Majority of commuters are not aware of silence zones due to lack of awareness and visibility of signboards. The traffic police and   ( ) should increase the visibility of silence zone signboards for spreading more awareness among people. While the police should penalize commuters using air and musical horns, it should also crackdown on those selling it,” Satyen Kulabker, traffic expert said. 
 
 He added that the police should hold more awareness drivers to educate people, especially youngsters, to not honk unnecessarily. “And commuters too should show some self-restrain while using horns,” Kulabker told TOI. In fact, incessant honking is leading to noise pollution in almost every area of the city. From cars to two-wheelers, commuters driving any vehicle honk their way out during the peak hours. Some even use horns at traffic signals when the light is red while some honk loudly on crossroads. 
 
 The police department has authority to penalize those honking incessantly or in no-honking zones they seem helpless when it comes to penalizing compulsive honkers. 
 
 “Honking is an area of concern but we have been focusing more on unsafe driving, wearing helmets and seatbelts and discouraging talking over mobile phones while driving. Rather than enforcing, people should themselves follow the no-honking rules and drive with some patience. It is more about civic sense,” said  , city police commissioner. He added that the cops do try to spread awareness about traffic rules including honking in companies and schools.
