LUCKNOW: Having secured a seven-day remand of alleged   operative Salim Khan on Friday, the anti-terrorist squad of   will focus on unearthing connections of the terror group in the state. Salim was arrested from Mumbai airport on July 16. According to ATS, Salim was responsible for wiring money to sleeper agents in the country. One such agent, Aftab Ali, was arrested from Faizabad in May for spying on military installations.

 On Friday, a police team under DySP Dinesh Puri produced Salim at a local court. Sources privy to investigations said Salim had given names of three people who operate from UP to sleuths. However, ATS was yet to verify the details. 
 
 “He is a hard nut to crack. The names he gave us could be fictitious, intended to send us on a wild goose chase,” said the source.
 
 It is believed that Salim has deep knowledge of penetration of terror groups supported by   in the country. A native of Fatehpur, Salim was staying in   before his passport expired. He underwent arms training in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, a decade ago along with terrorists responsible for the Rampur CRPF camp attack.
 
 IG ATS Asim Arun said the agency was trying to extract information about hawala operations of terror groups. 
 
 “As central agencies have exposed how unrest in Kashmir was being sponsored by Pakistan, we expect to get some idea about organised terror funding, through Salim,” said Arun.
