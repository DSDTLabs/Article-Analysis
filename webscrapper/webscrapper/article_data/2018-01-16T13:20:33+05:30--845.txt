Mysuru: Balehonnur Rambhapuri seer Veera Someshwara Shivacharya Swamy on Monday slammed the pontiffs and political leaders who are demanding a separate religion tag for   community.

 He was addressing a gathering at the   fair.
 
 Claiming that Lingayats are part of   religion, Shivacharya Swamy said the religion has a history of thousands of years. “Basavanna and other sharanas spread the values of Veerashaiva religion in the form of vachanas. Themes of these vachanas are part of Siddanta Shikhamani, which is the holy book of Veerashaivas…Veerashaivas and Lingayats are one and the same,” he said.
 
 Taking a dig at politicians and pontiffs who are spearheading the separate Lingayat religion movement, he said that these people are creating problems in the society.
 
 “Politics is influencing religion. Politicians are dividing us in the name of caste. These people are trying to destroy our culture,” he said.
 
 “Veerashaiva religion is facing threat from insiders. Clashes are erupting as a few pontiffs are instigating people. Religion has just one way, but adharma has several ways,” he said.
 
 “Those who are holding responsible positions are not working honestly. This has led to internal clashes in the religion and society,” he said.
 
 “I know how to protect the religion,” he added.
 
 “Country and religion are like two eyes. Veerashaiva community always gives top priority to humanity. Today, the religion is facing a threat. We need to join hands and fight. Akhila Bharatha Veerashaiva Mahasabha must work more actively,” he said.
 
 He further said that the people in old Mysuru region have accepted the fact that there is no difference between Veerashaivas and Lingayats.
