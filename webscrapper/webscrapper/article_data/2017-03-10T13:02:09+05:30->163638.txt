According to a source, people in the city would often spot Vivaan taking Akshara on a scooter ride. In fact, everyone on set used to talk about the bond Vivaan developed with his scooter --- an older model that sometimes needed to be pushed and kicked repeatedly so that it could start. In the film, while Akshara plays a confident girl, Vivaan plays a role of a small town dreamer who works in a cafe as a steward. After few scenes, Vivaan actually started liking the scooter rides and would often zoom on to it to nearby places.

The film is about a couple Laali and Laaddoo played by Akshara and Vivaan getting stuck at a Royal wedding that takes place in Vadodara.
