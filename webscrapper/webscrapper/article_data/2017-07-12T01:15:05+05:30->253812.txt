Chandigarh: Cash-strapped UT administration will have to spend from its own pocket to maintain highways that it has denotified, said NGO ArriveSafe president Harman Sidhu after the Supreme Court rejected his petition against a Punjab and Haryana high court order upholding the denotification done by the UT.

 “Now, roads will become a casualty. Earlier, the money for maintenance of roads was coming from the central fund, but the administration will now have to maintain them,” said the man behind the booze ban on highways.
 
 Sidhu vowed to continue to fight for the welfare of people. “It is the responsibility of the government to work for the welfare of people. But unfortunately, we are doing that job. I respect the court’s decision but my legal fight will continue,” he said.
 
 Slamming the administration, Sidhu said it knows how to change the rules of the game. “Who knows that there are 27 state highways within the limits of Chandigarh alone. Highways need to be numbered and milestones put up, but there is nothing like this in Chandigarh. The administration just wants to help the liquor lobby,” he said. 
 
 Recalling that liquor vends were shut on national and state highways after much struggle and legal fight, Sidhu said he will not sit idle and continue to fight.
