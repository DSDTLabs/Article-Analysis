NEW DELHI: A DU student and a graduate were   after the latter impersonated the former to appear for an   at   College on Wednesday. The impersonator was caught by the college authorities and handed over to police after some students alerted the invigilator during a science exam.

 
 In his police complaint, the college principal said that the graduate was spotted by the other students who alerted the professor invigilating the exam. The principal and four other professors who used to teach the particular batch were called in to identify the youth. He was identified as Yashvir Yadav, a former student of the college. Yadav had pasted his photograph on the admit card of the student, Rahul, to make it look genuine.
 
 DCP (North) Jatin Narwal said that a case of impersonation and cheating has been registered at Maurice Nagar police station. Rahul was tracked down from the address mentioned in the college records and arrested. Rahul told police that Yadav was a student of the same stream and had offered to appear on his behalf since he was not prepared to take the exam.
 
 Police said that a similar incident was reported last year. Rahul, a native of Hapur, had enrolled with Delhi University two years ago. He had befriended Yadav while the latter was in his final year. Yadav is being interrogated to find out if he had helped other students clear their examinations.
