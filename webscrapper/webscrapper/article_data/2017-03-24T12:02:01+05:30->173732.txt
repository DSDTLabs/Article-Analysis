CHENNAI:   chief commercial manager  , a crusader against corruption, has been named member (technical) of the Railway Claims Tribunal.

 The appointment, announced on Wednesday, is seen as a moral victory for Saxena who had been under fire from various ‘mafias’ for his crusades. He was particularly unpopular with the leadership of   (SRMU), the sole recognised union in the zone. A year ago, a few   members barged into his office for a ‘showdown’ before saying they had been influenced by the SRMU leadership.
 
 Saxena was one of 17 all-India officers shortlisted for the prestigious post on February 14. Around the same time, an order of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court was released to the media. It was based on a petition by Madurai-based advocate M Ramesh which alleged Saxena was running an NGO without permission. The order “directed the CBI to consider the petitioner’s complaint and investigate it within three months of the date of receipt of the order”.
 
 The order was given on November 24, 2016, but signature of the assistant registrar on the copy is dated February 16, 2017, two days after Saxena was short-listed for the post. The selection order of Saxena will be subject to the outcome of the CBI investigation.
 
 Documents with TOI show Saxena in September 2014 applied for permission to run the NGO and it was registered in December 2015. In his submission to CBI, Saxena provided details of the money transactions in the NGO’s account and denied all allegations.
 
 A senior   members told TOI Saxena’s selection had given courage to all officers targeted by false allegations just before their retirement.
 
 “It has given moral courage to all officers who are targeted by false allegations just before their retirement,” the official said.
