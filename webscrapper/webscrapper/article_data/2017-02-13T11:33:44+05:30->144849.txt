NAGPUR: 44-year-old drunk woman, identified as Rani Madawi, brutally hammered her husband Tilak (46) to death as she was fed up of the latter constantly doubting her of having illicit relationship with another man.

 The incident happened in   in Manish Nagar at Sonegaon on late Saturday night. It was the couple’s neighbour who, after hearing some noise, peeped through their main door and got to know about the incident. 
 
 Sonegaon police rushed to the spot after being informed by the landlord   but till that time neighbours had shifted Tilak, who was bleeding profusely, to Government medical college and hospital (GMCH). Tilak died in the wee hours of Sunday. The couple belonged to Kathi village in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 The offence of murder has been registered against Rani under section 302 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), following the compliant of Wasant Raut (40), the couple’s neighbour. Culprit was produced before court on Sunday that remanded her to police custody for two days.
 
 Rani, a household worker, and Tilak, a plumber, had shifted to the new place around a fortnight ago, along with their 20-year-old younger son Krishna. The son used to assist Tilak in his daily work. Their elder son Naresh was searching a job in Uttarakhand , said cops.
 
 “On Saturday night, Krishna, under the influence of liquor, had tiff with Tilak over his behaviour towards his mother. Later, Krishna left the place with his friend,” said senior PI Sanjay Pande. After he went, a drunkard Tilak slapped Rani, who, too, was in inebriated condition. An angry Rani picked up a hammer, which Tilak would use for work, and hit him on right side of his face. He tried to duck but the woman hit him again on the back head and on the body, added Pande.
 
 Rani was kept under watch overnight at her place. Cops brought her to police station and arrested her on Sunday morning. Sources from the police station told TOI, “Rani was not informed about Tilak’s death.” Cops seized hammer from the spot.
