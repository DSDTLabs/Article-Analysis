A mother is evidently expressive about her feelings for her child, but a father is usually the silent pillar of support. Who better than   to understand this? The filmmaker dropped a few promotional activities of his upcoming film ' ' on Thursday evening to rush to his son Aasmaan, who was admitted to a suburban hospital for a minor surgery. His wife, singer   was by their son’s side, but he was also eager to see daddy.

 “Vishal is extremely loving and possessive of his kid like any father is. And when he was told that his son was waiting to see him and was also ready to be discharged from the hospital, he excused himself from a couple of promotional activities. He was only happy to take his boy home and spend the night by his bedside,” says a source close to Vishal. We wish Aasmaan a speedy recovery.
