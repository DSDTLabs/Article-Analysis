NEW DELHI: For over a week, Delhi   has been sitting on an all-important inquiry   submitted by the university’s sexual   redressal cell after charges were levelled against the head of chemistry department. 

 The report itself missed the 90-day deadline and came after five months. But instead of acting on the suggestions, which includes censuring of the HOD,   has been non-committal. The charges against   were brought by an ad hoc teacher who had said he and six other faculty members had passed sexually coloured remarks on her during an interview. 
 
 The inquiry report released by   on May 21 and accessed by   found “the act of Chandra to be sexual harassment”. The report also warned other faculty members and stopped them from being part of any interview committee in the future where the teacher would be applying for. 
 
 Chandra told TOI that he is yet to get a copy of the report, but insisted “it is an advisory to me and has asked me not to do something like this again”. He added that the case would set a bad precedent as in future “we can’t even ask questions during interviews”. 
 
 DU   and pro-VC confirmed receipt of the report, but said it would be “discussed”. Chandra said the discussion would involve a sub-committee comprising the pro-VC, VC, proctor and two members of Executive Council. But sources said no such committee has been notified yet. 
 
 A case witness alleged that the report was diluted and shouldn’t have been delayed so much as the case was filed on December 21, 2017. “The university should now act on it and punish Chandra,” the witness said.
 
 The witness also alleged that the university was trying to save Chandra and might let him off with a warning. 
 
 The report also directed the university to apprise the deans and heads of departments to have zero tolerance towards sexual harassment.
