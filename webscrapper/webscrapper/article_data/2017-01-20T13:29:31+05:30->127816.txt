HYDERABAD: ‘Dangal’ star   from   has rebuffed Union minister for sports and youth affairs Vijay Goel on Friday for a comment that he made about her.

 The 16-year-old responded to a tweet of Vijay Goel who posted a picture of him with a painting of a woman in burkha.
 
 “This painting tells a story similar to that of Zaira Wasim,” he said tagging the young actress on Twitter.
 
 Zaira Wasim, who is already at the centre of a controversy facing flak for meeting J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, was quick to react to Vijay Goel’s tweet which also read, “More power to our daughters!”
 
 Addressing him as ‘sir’ in her response, Zaira Wasim said: “Sir, with all respect to you, I feel I must disagree. I request you not to connect me to such a discourteous depiction.   are beautiful and free. Moreover, the story depicted through this painting is not even remotely relevant to mine,” she said.
