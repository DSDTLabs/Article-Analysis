New Delhi: The Centre will provide Rs 300 crore to Delhi for procuring machines and other infrastructure such as underground   bins to deal with the garbage menace.

 The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by housing and urban affairs secretary   on Thursday. “The assistance will come from the Urban Development Fund. The secretary has directed that substantial deployment of machines and other infrastructure must be be ensured by October 2,” said a ministry official. 
 
 The Centre has taken keen interest to ensure that garbage management improves in the national capital where it has become a chronic problem. 
 
 Concerned over the growing problem of sanitation and filth in Delhi, housing and urban affairs minister   had directed his ministry to convene a meeting with officials of the three municipalities.
 
 Sources said the ministry was pushing for significant improvement and to put things in order considering BJP won the last civic polls in the name of Prime Minister   despite the party’s poor performance during its earlier two terms.
 
 State BJP president Manoj Tiwari had said clearing garbage would be the main focus and the city would be made clean.
