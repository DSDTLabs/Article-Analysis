HYDERABAD: Papaiah received minor injuries on his left hand on Monday when the under-construction building collapsed in Kondapur. Shocked, the 50-year-old refused treatment. 

 It was not his own injuries that bothered him as much as news of his wife's death. Doctors at   had to let him go without giving him stitches on his middle finger. Despite the medical team trying their best to console him, he remained agitated. "Luckily, he did not suffer any major injuries. He is safe," Dr Prasad, who treated him, said. 
 
 Along with Papaiah, Balaraj was rushed to the hospital around 11.30am. He too lost his wife in the accident. "They constantly pleaded with us to let them go as they had to perform the last rites of their wives," a hospital official said. 
 
 Balaraj was diagnosed with high BP. "He was numb and could not come to terms with what had happened to his wife," said one official. Both the injured refused to eat anything or even drink tea. The medical team at the hospital had to push them for an X-Ray too. With great difficulty they gave a statement to police over three hours after they were wheeled in. tnn
