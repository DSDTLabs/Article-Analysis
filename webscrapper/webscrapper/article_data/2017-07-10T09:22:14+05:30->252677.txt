NEW DELHI: The Narendra   last week permitted the Tibetan government in exile to perform rituals on the eve of the Dalai Lama’s   on the shores of Ladakh’s famous Pangong Lake along the disputed boundary with China, a significant move in the middle of a faceoff with Beijing in the Dokalam area near the Bhutan trijunction.
 
  The Modi government allowed Lobsang Sangay, the “Sikyong” (president) of the Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala, to travel to Ladakh on Wednesday and perform rituals on the shores of the Pang Gong Lake, located on the   ( ). Sangay and other Tibetan Buddhist monks performed rituals on the lake side praying for long life of the Dalai Lama on the eve of his birthday, persons familiar with the matter said. The spiritual and temporal head of Tibetans, the Dalai Lama, who turned 82 on Thursday, addressed a gathering in Leh on the same day.
  
  Earlier in April, New Delhi had facilitated a visit by the Dalai Lama to Tawang near LAC in Arunachal — a move that drew sharp criticism in Beijing and considered by experts as one of the key reasons behind China’s assertion in the Indo-Bhutan-China trijunction along Sikkim.
  
  The TGIE (officially known as Central Tibetan Administration), based in Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh, posted on its website a report and with pictures of Sangay on the bank of the Pang Gong Lake in Ladakh performing rituals on the eve of the Dalai Lama’s birthday.
  
  The LAC passes through the Pang Gong Lake and China & India have differences on the alignment of LAC. India accuses China of illegally occupying a section of the lake, which has Tibet on its eastern end. The area witnessed a conflict between soldiers of India and China during the 1962 war. It still remains a sensitive point along LAC. The Chinese PLA personnel on boats often cross the LAC and intrude into territory claimed by India.
