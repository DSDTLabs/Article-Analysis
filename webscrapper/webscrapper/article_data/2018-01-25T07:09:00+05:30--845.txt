CHANDIGARH: The   of Private School Association,   has announced to observe a bandh on January 30 to protest the killing of a school principal by a student in   last week and the alleged biased attitude of the state government towards the school managements.

 Federation’s head Kulbhushan Sharma also flayed the Haryana chief minister and his cabinet for not reacting to the incident. The federation also asked the Haryana government to take them into account while framing the policy for private schools and their infrastructure.
 
 “Yamunanagar killing is the worst case we have before us. The government now wants to search each and every student. It wants to invoke new rules as it has done in the case of Ryan International School of Gurugram. We don’t want any relaxation, but we request the government to treat the private schools at par with the state-run institutions when it comes to dignity, safety and security of teachers,” said Sharma.
 
 He said on January 30, they would have another round of meeting at Yamunanagar to decide the further course of action. “We have sympathy for the management and the slain principal’s family,” he said.
 
  and  , office-bearers of   chapter of the federation, said, “Today 52% of school children are enrolled with the government schools in Haryana. Has anybody asked about the CCTV cameras or other issues there? Why are the teachers, staff and management of private schools targeted? We humbly request the government to frame one rule for all.”
