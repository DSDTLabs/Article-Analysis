PANAJI: Real estate developers constructing commercial or residential projects in special residential zones and special commercial zones will be able to provide two levels of stilt   which will not be calculated in the sanctioned FAR.

 The town and country planning department notified the draft Goa Land Development and Building Construction (Amendment) Regulations, 2018, on Thursday and has sought objections and suggestions from citizens and stakeholders within 30 days.
 
 As per the notification, two additional land use zones have been created – a Special Residential Zone and Special Commercial Zone— with floor area ratio (FAR) of 200 and 300 respectively.
 
 FAR refers to the relationship between the total amount of space constructed in the entire building and the total area of the land on which the building has been built.
 
 The notification states, “In special residential zones and in special commercial zones two stilts for parking shall be allowed free of FAR and also free from calculation of building height. The provision of access of 10m right of way may be relaxed for proposal of re-development, where there is no scope of expansion of the existing road, provided a minimum 8m access is available.”
 
 While providing for side and rear setbacks for buildings, the town and country planning department has introduced an option for buildings with 32m and 36m height. Buildings with a height of 32m and 36m will have to keep a setback of 9m and 10m respectively on the side and rear of the building.
