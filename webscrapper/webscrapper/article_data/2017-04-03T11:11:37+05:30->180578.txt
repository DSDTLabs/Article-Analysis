MARGAO: Chief minister   is in no hurry to move the   to seek relaxation over its order banning   along   in the state. Nevertheless, he assured a delegation of bar and restaurant owners association that met him in Margao on Sunday that the government would find a “concrete solution” to the issue soon.

 Hinting that the government wouldn’t rush to the Supreme Court seeking relaxation, Parrikar told the delegation, “At the right point, I will approach the court to modify the order”. 
 
 Sources privy to the meeting said Parrikar tried to prevail upon the delegation that the same bench of the Supreme Court wouldn’t be amenable to grant any concession over the issue, and instead favoured approaching the court at the “opportune time” backed by “sound reasoning”. 
 
 Parrikar, sources said, told the delegation that the government was also considering de-notifying certain national/state highways to bring some relief to those affected by the order, but expressed his apprehension that doing such an exercise forthwith would convey an impression that it was being done to circumvent the order. 
 
 The chief minister also assured bar and restaurant owners that the excise department would be asked to show leniency to affected units. The excise department would be asked to let the licences of liquor vending establishments be kept “live” so as to enable them to shift the units to alternative locations.
 
 “Implementation of the Supreme Court order is one thing, and seeking relaxation is quite another…I will work out the modalities tomorrow and let you know,” Parrikar told mediapersons as he emerged from the meeting. 
 
 Xavier Fernandes, assistant secretary,  , speaking to mediapersons expressed satisfaction over the chief minister’s assurances. “He has promised us that he will get us out of our troubles in phases,” he said.
