LUCKNOW: Beating all previous records,   has taken a big leap in   towards end of this financial year. On March 31,   posted   worth about Rs 185 crore, which is Rs 34 crore high than last year’s collections. This is almost 23% hike from last year which is far more than growth in the year before last of about 15%. 

 LMC claimed high collection has been on the back of big recoveries from government offices and institutional setups and also the positive impact of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016, which led to people turning up in large numbers to deposit their bundles of old currency till December 31. 
 
 An official said, “This year has been lucky, as we were able to collect current year tax as well as long pending arrears from government offices which were always on denial mode. For example, GPO has paid us Rs 45 lakh while the LDA is paying Rs 3 crore to us.” 
 
 Jal Kal has also posted a robust growth of around 15% at a total collection of over Rs 120 crore through water tax, sewer tax and water charges. Officials said they were able to increase collection because of more properties coming into the tax fold this year. Last year, Jal Kal had collected around Rs 105 crore.
