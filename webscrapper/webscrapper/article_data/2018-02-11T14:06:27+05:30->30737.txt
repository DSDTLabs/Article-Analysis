NEW DELHI: Home Minister   on Sunday exuded confidence that the ongoing operation against terrorists, who attacked an Army camp in  , would be concluded successfully soon.

 "Operation is still undergoing," he told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.
 
 "I think it is not proper for me to comment on when the operation is still on. I'm sure that our jawans, who are in the operation, will successfully conclude it," he said.
 
 A group of heavily armed   terrorists struck the sprawling camp of the 36 brigade of Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry in the early hours of Saturday, triggering a gunbattle.
 
 Two of the attackers in combat gear were gunned down yesterday.
