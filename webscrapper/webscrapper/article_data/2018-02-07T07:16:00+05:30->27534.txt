Gurgaon: Cloudy skies and change in   direction has brought the mercury down in the city, even as colder conditions are likely to persist for two to three days before the western disturbance takes the temperature up again, according to Regional   Forecasting Centre (RWFC).

 On Tuesday,   weather persisted for the second consecutive day. Residents also said a mild drizzle occurred at around 12pm, lasting barely for a minute.
 
 On Tuesday, the maximum temperature dropped to 21 degrees. Two days before, it was 25 degrees Celsius, although the minimum temperature continued an upward trend and finished at 11 degrees compared to 9 degrees recorded on Monday. Officials said with change in wind direction and dissipation of the cloud cover Tuesday evening onwards, minimum temperatures will dip further. “It will settle at 8-9 degrees for the next 1 to 2 days,” an official said. “There has been some rainfall activity in the mountainous regions and because wind direction has changed and NCR is now receiving northwesterly and westerly winds, which will result in colder conditions.”
 
 Officials said that due to the advent of another western disturbance which is likely to make some precipitation on February 12, daytime conditions might turn warmer. “We are going to see warmer days and cooler nights. Clear skies will enable solar radiations to enter the atmosphere but they will also ensure that radiation goes back after dark. Besides, whenever a western disturbance approaches, it invariably leads to slight increase in temperatures,” officials explained. “On the evening of February 11, clouds are expected to form once again. Thunder development may also occur. And on the 12th, we are expecting the conditions to intensify further. But the whole process is still being observed and monitored. We will keep issuing updates accordingly.”
