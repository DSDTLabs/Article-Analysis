NEW DELHI/INDOR : In a serious breach of the government mint, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) caught a senior officer at the RBI-controlled   press (BNP) facility in   stealing newly printed currency notes. Currency notes worth Rs 90 lakh were recovered from his office and residence which he reportedly stole over a period of time. 

 Security officials say the incident raises doubts over the mint's audit of newly printed notes. 
 
 The CISF, which guards all currency printing facilities of government, had lately found that  , deputy of   (NVF), had been behaving in a suspicious manner. He was placed under CCTV surveillance since Thursday. 
 
 During its surveillance CISF found that he would often go near the wooden box of rejected cash reserve and stoop under a table. On Friday morning, Verma was seen hiding something discreetly in an empty wooden box lying in the corridor of the facility. Thereafter, he was frisked and it was found that he hid newly printed notes in his shoes and clothes besides drawers in his office. The notes are understood to be part of reject currency lot owing to minor printing defects. 
 
 "We found Rs 90,09,300 rupees in Rs 500 and Rs 200 denominations in Verma's locker and house. He has been arrested and is being interrogated about his modus operandi," Dewas SP Anshuman Singh told TOI. 
 
  From his office, CISF recovered bundles of newly printed currency, in the denomination of Rs 500, Rs 200 worth Rs 26.09 lakh. Later, police raided his house where pillows, beds and bathrooms coughed up wads of notes totalling Rs 64.50 lakh. "It was a great operation by our team and the officer who noticed the suspicious activity is being rewarded," said CISF director general O P Singh. Verma was posted in the rejected notes section as senior supervisor.
