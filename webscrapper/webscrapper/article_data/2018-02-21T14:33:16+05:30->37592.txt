NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP president   along with other   and workers   outside chief minister Arvind   on Tuesday evening against the alleged   on the  . They demanded  . 

 “The urban Naxalite face of Arvind Kejriwal is out in the open. The violence unleashed on the Delhi chief secretary by AAP MLAs exposes the anarchic behaviour of the Kejriwal party. Earlier, they had similarly attacked BJP MLAs in the assembly and many government officials have filed complaints of similar behaviour in the past. The assault on chief secretary is a repeat of the assault on us when we went to meet the CM on January 30,” said Tiwari. 
 
 The demonstration started at Chandgi Ram Akhada and went up to the CM’s residence where anti-Kejriwal slogans were shouted. 
 
 Tiwari added that the confrontation between the government and the officials was unprecedented. “The silence of Delhi CM on the misbehaviour with the chief secretary is an evidence of his own involvement in the incident,” said Tiwari. 
 
 Leader of opposition in assembly Vijender Gupta said the incident would live in infamy. “This is a blot on Indian democracy and should be fully condemned. The CM calls the chief secretary at midnight, and along with a dozen MLAs assaults him, abuses him because the chief secretary had objected to the advertisements issued by the CM at the expense of government,” said Gupta. 
 
 Gupta said it was for the first time that a chief secretary was physically assaulted in the presence of both the CM and deputy CM: “It is shocking beyond words. Such a government must be summarily dismissed.” Calling the incident a well-planned conspiracy against the bureaucracy, Gupta added that bureaucrats feel there is no atmosphere to work.
