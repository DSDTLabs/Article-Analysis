  The most celebrated television host has been living out of suitcase since quite some time now.
  
  After successfully hosting the dance reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa this year, the actor started rehearsing for Salman Khan’s world tour Da-Bang and eventually performed in different international cities including Hong Kong, Sydney, Auckland and Melbourne.
  
  
 
  
  Besides that, Maniesh was also busy with other commitments including his television show, Science of Stupid that airs on Nat Geo channel and shooting for two films – Vikram Phadnis’ Hrudayantar and Baa Baa Blacksheep, which left him with no time to unwind, or even catch up with sleep.
  
  Accordingly, Maniesh decided to take his family to Hong Kong on the occasion of his father’s 70th birthday and also for the much-needed break. He also booked a private cruise for sight-seeing and exploring exotic destinations
