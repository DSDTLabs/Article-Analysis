NEW DELHI:   has started releasing additional   to Delhi after the   asked it on Thursday to immediately release 450 cusecs every day. However, the situation is yet to reach normalcy. 

  ( ) vice-chairman Dinesh Mohania said that within a few hours of the SC order, additional water started coming through the DD8 canal. “We have started receiving almost 50-60 cusecs of additional raw water in the Yamuna but Haryana has not yet met its obligation according to which almost 150 cusec additional water should have been released,” said the AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar. 
 
 The importance of the issue is clear from the court’s directive to the Haryana chief secretary to personally appear before it in the next hearing, he added. SC has asked both chief secretaries to appear before it.
 
 Although the shortage of water is currently at manageable levels, a shortfall of 50-60 MGD of potable water has been experienced for the past three months. After filing cases in NGT and the Delhi high court, DJB approached the apex court in March-end. 
 
 Delhi has 11 water treatment plants with Chandrawal, Wazirabad, Haiderpur, Bhagirathi, Bawana, Nangloi, Sonia Vihar, Okhla and Dwarka being the major facilities. Although the Wazirabad and Chandrawal plants have remained primarily affected due to their dependency on raw water from the Yamuna, some shortfall is witnessed in the areas covered by other plants too due to rationing of water.
