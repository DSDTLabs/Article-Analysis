GURUGRAM: A 26-year-old man, the son of a city-based  , allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving   near Dhankot village on Sunday night. A suicide note has been recovered from the body.

 The man has been identified as Ashwini Mangla, a resident of Adarsh Nagar. His father, Jitender, owns a footwear business. 
 
 Ashwini’s severed body was discovered on Delhi-Jaipur railway track near Dhankot on Monday morning.
 
 He went missing around 8pm on Sunday, and his family filed a missing person’s complaint later that night. On Sunday morning, government railway police (GRP) got a call about a body lying on the railway track. The body was identified with the help of documents in a pocket. A two-page suicide note was also recovered, in which Ashwini said he loved his family but was upset for not excelling professionally. He blamed no one for the tragic step.
 
 “This is a shock to us as we never saw him tense even for a second, leave aside being depressed. The family is dumbstruck,” said a relative. 
 
 “We handed over the body to his family after the postmortem, and are investigating the matter,” said inspector Pawan Kumar, SHO of GRP (Gurgaon).
