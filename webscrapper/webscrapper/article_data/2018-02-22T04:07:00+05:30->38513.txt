Vadodara/Ahmedabad: The Union government is yet to take a final call on setting up an AIIMS in Gujarat. The Gujarat government has shown it possible sites in Vadodara and Rajkot. In response to a question raised by Visavadar MLA Harshad Ribbadiya, health minister Nitin Patel said that the inspection of these sites has been completed and the Gujarat government is waiting for the final decision from the Union government. Congress leaders alleged that the BJP has not taken effective measures to solve the issue, to which Nitin Patel said that in the past the Congress MPS, some of who are now MLAs in the assembly, had not raised issues in the interest of the state. Nitin Patel’s retort enraged Congress MLA Vikram Madam, earlier an MP. He rushed to the well of the house in protest and later walked out of the assembly. MLA from the ruling BJP Yogesh Patel, meanwhile, batted for AIIMS in Vadodara. Patel argued that Vadodara’s location could ensure that patients from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra too benefited from the institute. He pointed out that persons from poor regions around Vadodara including the tribal belt came to the city for treatment. Yogesh Patel who represents the Manjalpur assembly seat in Vadodara said that while Vadodara had the SSG Hospital, it was overburdened and now had its limitations. Speaking to The Times of India, the Raopura MLA said that in 2014 he had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi too that he should consider Vadodara for an AIIMS. While teams from Centre have visited both Vadodara and Rajkot and seen possible sites for an AIIMS campus, a final decision is yet to be made.
