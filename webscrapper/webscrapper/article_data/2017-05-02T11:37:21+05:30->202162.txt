Jason Segel, famous for starring in sitcoms, R-rated comedy movies, and a friend of the  , has got something to be occupied with yet again. Segel and his co-writer   have announced that later this year they will come out with a Yong Adult sci-fi novel titled 
 , the first one in a proposed trilogy about a futuristic video game.

  The 37-year-old actor told 
 , "When I was a teenager, I was one of the lucky few who got to experience a game very much like 
  before it was shut down. When I heard rumblings it was being reimagined for VR, I knew it was something Kirsten and I had to write about. Part mythic adventure, part sci-fi love story, entirely cautionary tale—we wanted to reach the new generation of potential players before this 'game' becomes a reality."
 
  This new venture isn’t Jason’s first book. His fans probably know that Miller and Jason wrote a series of children's books called 
 , which turned up on the   list. However, 
  is their first swoop into an older territory.
 
  The premise of the books seems vaguely familiar. Otherworld is a game, something in the likes of The Sims, but it is based on total virtual reality where people can choose to be whomever or whatever they like. However, as the game continues and catches on with more people, players begin to realize maybe it's not as innocent as they thought.
 
  Although Segel may be just two books old, he is not new to writing. He has written scripts for 
 , 
  and a few other films in which he starred as well. 
 
  Otherworld is set to release on November 7. Segel is currently starring in the sci-fi movie 
  on  , which is his most recent work.
