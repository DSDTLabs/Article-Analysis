PATNA: Senior   leader   claimed on Friday that the Union environment ministry has ordered the construction work of a mall being built here by a company in which   supremo   Prasad’s son Tejashwi is a director be stopped.

 The former Bihar deputy chief minister claimed that the Union ministry of environment & forest (MoEF) has ordered the construction of the mall at Saguna Mor in Patna be stopped as it is “being built without obtaining environmental clearance”. He claimed that in an order dated May 15, the ministry has said, “The project required prior environmental clearance and it is now a case of violation of Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, as the work at the site has been undertaken without obtaining prior environmental clearance.”
 
 “In view of above you are directed to stop the work on site with immediate effect and furnish a report in the matter to the ministry in three weeks time,” he read out from the copy of the order “issued” by the ministry.
 
 Sushil, who distributed the copy of the order to the media, said four days have lapsed since the order was passed but the state government is yet to take a decision to stop the construction work. “This shows the type of ‘sushashan’ (good governance) prevailing in the state,” he said and dared chief minister Nitish Kumar to “intervene into the illegal construction of the mall and stop the construction work, seal the project and seize the benami property”.
 
 The BJP leader alleged that starting construction of a mall on a land measuring 7.66 lakh sq ft is a violation of the provisions of Forest Conservation Act 1986. 
 
 He claimed that any construction on a land measuring beyond 2 lakh sq ft must obtain prior environmental clearance from State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority as per the Act.
