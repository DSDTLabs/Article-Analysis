JAIPUR:   has miserably failed to register its presence in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, 2018, announced by HRD minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday. The saving grace for state are its two institutes which made into the list of top 100 in the prestigious ‘overall’ category—Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani (26th) and  , Niwai (91st). The rankings were announced in nine categories—overall, management, universities, pharmacy, engineering, colleges, law, medical and architecture.

 
 The state has around 200 government colleges along with notable constituent colleges of Rajasthan University—Maharani’s College, Maharaja’s College, Commerce College and  , but none of them is listed in the top 100 list in the ‘colleges’ category.   of veterinary and animal sciences and Rajasthan University dropped out of the list of top 100 universities from last year’s 68th and 79th position. BITS secured 17th and Banasthali Vidhyapith 64th position in the same category.
 
 RU scored poorly in placements, regional diversity, public perception, total budget and its utilization, combined metric for research. Another shocker was Malviya National Institute of Technology (MNIT) failing to make it to the list in any category. While in architecture category, no institute has applied for ranking. Most shockingly,   which has national repute is missing from the list of top 100 medical colleges. Even Central University, Kishangarh, has no mention in any of the eligible categories.
 
 Higher education expert Puneet Sharma said, “Out of 210 institutes which made into the list of all nine categories, only five from Rajasthan tells a poor story from a state which boasts of an upcoming education hub.”
