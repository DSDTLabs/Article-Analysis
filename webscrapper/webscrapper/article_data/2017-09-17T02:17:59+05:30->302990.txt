GHAZIABAD: A non-bailable warrant (NBW) has been issued against former MLA and Congress leader  , an accused in   worker Gajender Bhati’s   case. Sharma is untraceable after a shooter allegedly hired by him spilled the beans. 

 “A NBW has been issued against Amarpal Sharma and one Raju Pehelwan, both accused in the murder case,” said Akash Tomar, SP City, adding, “The NBW has been issued after Sharma failed to surrender and different police teams are raiding his possible hideout.”
 
 Gajender Bhati, a local BJP functionary from Khoda, was shot dead on September 2 by bike-borne attackers. Bhati’s brother in an FIR lodged said he was killed at his behest. Sharma had said that it was a political conspiracy against him. But on September 10, police arrested the shooter Narendra Fauzi who said he was paid by Sharma to eliminate Bhati.
