PUNE: Former Northern   (retd) on Monday criticised the   in Jammu & Kashmir for the prevailing unrest in the state and failing to live up to people’s expectation since coming to power. 

 Speaking on ‘Kashmir’ at a lecture organised by NGO Sarhad, Hooda said, “People in J&K had high hopes from the government, but the ruling alliance does not appear to have worked well owing to ideological differences. They are only concentrating on their constituencies rather than focusing on the entire state. People do not see any political outreach and the same has made them more frustrated and angry.”
 
 Hooda, who retired as Northern Army Commander on November 30 last year, said, “J&K has 70% population, which is below the age of 30 years. Internal job opportunities are very limited. Schools are often shut due to unrest. This needs to be dealt with delicately by the government to gain people’s confidence.” 
 
 He said, “2001 was tough as about 4,500 deaths, including those of civilians and security forces personnel, were reported. The scenario changed by 2012, which reported 117 deaths in the state. However, the government has not been able to capitalise on this situation.”
