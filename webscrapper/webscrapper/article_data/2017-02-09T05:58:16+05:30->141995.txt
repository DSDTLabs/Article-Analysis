BHATINDA: A station house officer (SHO) and two head constables of Punjab Police were suspended on Wednesday for allegedly beating up and stripping a Congress worker in Bathinda district in November 2015. 

 Earlier, police had given clean chit to   and head constables Ram Singh and   for the alleged assault on Congress supporter Dharam Singh. The latest suspension orders came after a video clip of the assault and stripping went viral on Tuesday. 
 
 Dharam, resident of Bhai Rupa village, and three others were detained by police as they had announced to show black flags to rural development minister   on November 17, 2015, in the aftermath of acts of desecrations in Punjab. They were, however, released after some time.
 
 Dharam had been approaching senior police officials for over a year to complain about the assault during his detention, but no action had been taken. However, residents of his village protested after the video went viral and met Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) for action against the cops. 
 
 Bathinda SSP   confirmed the suspensions. “Though action has been delayed, it has finally been taken. We did not have evidence earlier,” he added.
 
 “The two policemen had slapped me and taken off my clothes. I approached the authorities against the cops, but no action was taken. Now when one of the Congress workers uploaded the video clip on social media, police have finally taken action against the accused,” said Dharam.
