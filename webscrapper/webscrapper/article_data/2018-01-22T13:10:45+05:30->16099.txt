VISAKHAPATNAM: Internship programmes in academic and professional subjects are common but when an agricultural farm organises an internship programme in  , it is a novel idea.

 Participants to this internship programme, to be held in February-March would be encouraged to manage the farm on their own — from sowing the seeds, growing vegetables, learning Bonsai techniques, getting to know about farm animals and so on. “Nowadays many   and youngsters take a fancy to organic farming and leave their daily jobs to pursue this newfound interest. However, they need to have some basic understanding about farming techniques. Therefore, to enhance their knowledge through a short practical training at a farm itself, I thought of starting this internship programme not just for farmers, but for interested youths, entrepreneurs and corporates,” said 28-year-old Jagadish  , who runs a 2.80 acre   near  .
 
 “Last year, we organised a two-day farming workshop but this time there would be a full-fledged internship programme,” added Sanapala. 
 
 The internship programme would also include screening of relevant farming documentaries and power-point presentations, narration of farming experiences and imparting of knowledge regarding not just production but marketing of products as well. For students and poor farmers, the internship would be free of cost while some nominal amount would be charged from entrepreneurs.
