Rajkot: The brutal murder of a young sarpanch of   village near Amreli on Tuesday has once again brought to fore the bitter caste conflict even as his killing was a fall-out of the recently held panchayat polls. 

 On Wednesday, Amreli police arrested one of the three persons accused in the case. The sarpanch,   Madhad’s, younger brother Arvind had lodged a complaint naming Deep Dhandhal, his brother Yuvi and Madhu Vala. Deep has been arrested. 
 
 “Jaysukh contested the panchayat election by defying warnings by Deep and other upper caste people. This did not go down well with them and his victory further infuriated them,” the complaint said. 
 
 Sources said that sarpanch’s seat was reserved for scheduled caste in Varsada. The upper caste group was divided during the poll and Jaysukh won.
 
 Jaysukh was attacked with swords and knives after being chased. He was murdered in front of Arvind, who is physically challenged. The brutality of the murder has sent a wave of anger within the dalit community. On Wednesday, dalit leader Jignesh Mevani met the family of Jaysukh at the  .
 
 “This was a horrifying murder. In villages, sarpanches are not allowed to discharge their duties. They are not even allowed to sit in the sarpanch’s chair and now an elected dalit sarpanch has been killed by upper caste people,” said Mevani. Besides Arvind, Madhad is survived by his wife, a five-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter.
 
 Meanwhile,  , a lawyer and dalit activist, was shifted to the hospital after his condition deteriorated while fasting. Parmar, who is on a fast since Tuesday, has demanded in-depth and fair probe stating this was a larger conspiracy to suppress Dalit voices. “There are more people involved in Jaysukh’s murder,” he said.
