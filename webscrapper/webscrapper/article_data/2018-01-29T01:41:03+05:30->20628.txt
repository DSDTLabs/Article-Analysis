Salem: Public works department officials closed the shutters of Stanley Reservoir in   on Sunday evening. The shutters were opened on October 2 for samba cultivation in delta districts.

 The department used to open the dam on June 12 and close it on January 28. The officials delayed the opening this time due to non-availability of water in the dam, disappointing farmers in the region, who were expecting that water will be released even after the official closing date.
 
 “But we were instructed to close the dam on January 28 itself,” a PWD official said.
 
 Meanwhile, supply of 500 cusecs of water for drinking purpose will continue, PWD sources said.
