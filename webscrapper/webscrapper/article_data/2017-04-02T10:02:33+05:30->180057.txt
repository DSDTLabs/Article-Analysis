CHENNAI: A head constable attached to the   police station was dismissed from service on the last day of his service for his alleged links with a 2005 question paper leak case. Head constable Sivakumar is among those who were confirmed guilty by the Madras high court in the case. He was supposed to retired from service on March 31. 

 The Chintadripet police registered a case on December 8, 2005 in connection with the scam, where at least 87 police personnel from the posts of additional director-general of police to the constabulary level were named in the first information report. Of them, nine police personnel turned as approvers in the case. After a detailed inquiry, charges framed against 46 police personnel had been dropped, while cases against 31 other police personnel were transferred to   for further inquiry. However, when the case was pending before the CBI inquiry, many police officers retired from the service and action was initiated only against a few officers.
 
 Meanwhile, six police personnel J Durai Munusamy, S Chinna Thambi, S Anbalagan, N Ravichandran, A Karuppasamy and R Anbalagan approached the Madras high court seeking the court to relieve them from the case, saying their names were falsely implicated in the case. The Madras high court declined their review petition and directed the investigation officials conclude the case within four months.
