Trichy: Passengers’ fight over reservation seats for VIP’s in TNSTC service buses turned ugly when a passenger retaliated with punches in exchange of blows from a police personnel on Sunday.

 Police arrested the duo including assistant headmaster of a government school K Muthu Kumar and D Padmanabhan 33 from Top Sengattupatti under 5 sections and produced him to Court. Later they were remanded in judicial custody.
 
 The incident took place when Muthu Kumar who was engaged in altercation with the TNSTC official was unexpectedly slapped by special sub inspector Sekar attached to the Thuraiyur police station. 
 
 Within no time, Muthu Kumar retaliated with a slap on Sekar’s face. This led to a scuffle between police and passengers who were supporting Muthu Kumar. 
 
 Meanwhile, police took Muthu Kumar and one Padmanabhan into custody for beating up police. 
 
 The gathered passenger crowd held the police responsible for the scuffle as it was SSI Sekar who slapped Muthu Kumar first leaving no option before him but to retaliate. 
 
 “Muthu Kumar was raising legitimate questions as to when MLA’s or MP’s are not taking buses these days, why shouldn’t the seats reserved for VIP’s be given to general public,” said a passenger in the bus stand. 
 
 While two TNSTC buses start from Thuraiyur on daily basis to Chennai, the TNSTC officials withheld 8 tickets each in the two buses as usual which are meant for VIP’s. 
 
 About 50 people came to Thuraiyur bus stand on Monday to make advance booking for the service buses to Chennai. However, many of them denied tickets over rush due to newyear. However, TNSTC officials refuse to give the tickets reserved for VIP’s. Sources from the TNSTC said that most of the tickets are being given to the people recommend by higher official in the TNSTC.
