Filmmaker   said he had no idea how famous   was when he cast him in 'Dunkirk'. 
The 46-year-old director just knew Styles was in a boy band One Direction when he auditioned for a part in the upcoming movie.
 
 "I don't think I was that aware really of how famous Harry was. I mean, my daughter had talked about him. My kids talked about him, but I wasn't really that aware of it."
 
  
  
 "So the truth is, I cast Harry because he fit the part wonderfully and truly earned a seat at the table," Nolan said. 
 
   , who also features in the movie, said working with the 'Sign of the Times' singer impressed his niece more than anything else in his career till date. 
 
 "She was just more excited than anything I've ever done because I was going to be acting with Harry Styles. I went up in her estimation. I won the Harry!" Rylance said.
