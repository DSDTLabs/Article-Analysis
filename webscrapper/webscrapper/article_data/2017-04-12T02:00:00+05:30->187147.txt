PATNA: The   jawans, who had called off their agitation on April 5 after getting assurance from governor Ram Nath Kovind, again went on an indefinite strike across the state on Tuesday demanding equal pay for equal work.

 Despite calling off the strike, the home guard jawans were not allowed by the government to resume work.
 
 Around 72,000 home guard jawans, including 32,000 on active duty, went on an indefinite strike on Tuesday demanding equal pay for equal work on the basis of a   ruling of 2015. Last year, the Patna high court, in light of the Supreme Court ruling, had also asked state government to give equal pay for equal work to the home guard jawans.
 
 The jawans had earlier called off their strike only after Kovind termed their demands “legitimate” and assured them of taking up the matter with authorities concerned. 
 
 Bihar Home Guard Association general secretary Sudheshwar Prasad said the jawans sat on a peaceful protest in front of district commandant offices in all districts. 
 
 “We have also handed over a memorandum to the governor, apprising him that the government did not allow home guard jawans to resume work,” Prasad said, adding the strike would continue until the government allowed them to join duty.
 
 DG (home guard) P N Rai said the jawans were requested on several occasions not to go on strike, but to no avail. “Let them go on strike if they want to,” he added.
 
 The home guards’ agitation has paralysed police patrolling, traffic management and fire services in the state.
