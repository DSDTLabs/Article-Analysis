AHMEDABAD: After nearly 13 years in jail, the   has granted bail to   aide   alias Mammumiya Panjumiya in connection with two cases â€“ the Gossabara RDX landing case in Porbandar and for hatching a conspiracy for this in Jamnagar.

 The SC granted him conditional bail on furnishing a bail bond and surety of Rs 1 lakh each in both cases. He has been asked not to leave Porbandar district and to attend court proceedings without fail. As he cannot leave Porbandar, he will have to appear before the court for the Jamnagar case through video-conferencing.
 
 Mammumiya was facing various cases after the RDX landing in 1993. He was absconding for 10 years before he was extradited from the Middle East in 2004. He has been booked under the special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act ( ) apart from various other sections of the IPC and the Explosive Substances Act.
 
 Mammumiya has been one those accused in the landing of explosive substances, boxes of RDX powder, bags of firearms, 45 bags of weapons, 15 boxes of RDX and 225 silver ingots, which were smuggled into the country and taken to Zarodi and Dhanoli villages in Valsad district, after riots broke out in the aftermath of the   demolition.
 
 In 2010, a special TADA court denied him bail. The apex court noted that Mammumiya has already more than 12 years in jail without trial. The prior approval required under section 20(1) of TADA Act was not taken from the SP before registering the FIR in this case. The prosecution could examine only 25 of the 192 witnesses so far and there is no likelihood of the trial ending in the near future. After his extradition, Mammumiya was implicated in more than a dozen cases. He has been either discharged or acquitted in most cases, including the arms landing cases in Porbandar and Valsad. He was also exonerated in the Radhika Gymkhana massacre case. He was recently denied bail by a trial court in an arms-related case registered at Dariapur police station.
