BHOPAL: After computer skills and  , now women inmates of   are all set to pursue  . The course is affiliated to ITI College located in Govindpura.

 With this initiative, Bhopal central jail might has become the first in the state to introduce ITI course for women prisoners.
 
 However, the process to roll out ITI course in jail was not an easy task, as the ITI affiliating body refused jail to accept the Bachelor Preparatory Programme (BPP) of IGNOU under which the inmates have completed their class 10 and class 12. As per jail officials, the inmates will have to appear in an open exam in order to get a class 10 marksheet to take ITI course.
 
 Deputy superintendent of the Bhopal Central Jail   said, “The ITI course will include nursing, cosmetology, sewing and knitting. Till now, around 24 female prisoners have applied for the course, but due to BPP marksheet the session has not begun as yet. Through newspaper advertisements, we have even appointed teachers for the inmates. Right now we are offering courses like computer, doll making, jute cultivation, English speaking and general schooling. We have found that women prisoners are keen to learn new things. Just because they have committed a crime due to some circumstances, we don’t want them to stop their growth in life. Owing to this, we had started literacy and computer classes. In order to ensure a good job for them after they walk free, we decided to start the ITI course."
 
 Rupali Vishwakarma, an inmate who was convicted for a murder case in 2012, said: “I have completed my class 10 and 12 in jail through BPP. I am also perusing computer diploma. I want to study more and complete my ITI in nursing. However, due to affiliation issue, I will have to appear for open exam which will waste my year.”
 
 Jail officials have decided to end the BPP affiliated by IGNOU and start open exam as the degree is not valid for other universities. There are 120 female prisoners in Bhopal jail at present.
