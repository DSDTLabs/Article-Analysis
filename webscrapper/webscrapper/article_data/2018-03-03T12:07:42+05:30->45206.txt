 LONDON: A normal intake of vitamin D can reduce the risk of early death substantially in people with cardiovascular disease, a study has found.

 The research concludes that people who have suffered from cardiovascular disease, and have a normal intake of vitamin D, reduce their risk of morality as a consequence of the disease by 30 per cent.
 
 "We discovered that the right amount of vitamin D reduces the risk of death substantially. However, too much or too little increase the risk," said   from the   in  .
 
 Researchers followed as many as 4,000 patients with cardiovascular diseases from year 2000, for a period of 12 years.
 
 The average age of the participants was 62 years old at the start of the research.
 
 The study, published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, showed that it is favourable to have blood values around 42 to 100 nanomoles per litre (nmol/l). If you have higher or lower values, you are at greater risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.
 
 According to Dierkes, it is difficult to give general a recommendation of how much vitamin D supplementation one should take.
 
 "The optimal amount of vitamin D-supplement varies from one person to another. It depends where you live, and what kind of diet you have," Dierkes said.
