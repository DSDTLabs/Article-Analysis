Samajwadi Party's senior leader   is a sad man, coming to terms with the party's debacle months after it celebrated its 25th anniversary. Speaking to TOI over the phone from his constituency Jaswantnagar soon after he was declared winner from there, Shivpal lamented the way the party's founder   was neglected and felt it would not have performed so poorly had this not happened.

 
 
 The party is in a bad shape today because of the humiliation meted out to Mulayam Singh Yadav and the way he was neglected.
 
 
 
 
  was born out of struggle and hard work of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Under his leadership, SP defeated the mighty Congress and BJP. We will struggle again, go to the masses and onto the streets. SP will soon be back in the centrestage.
 
 
 
 Arrogance and misplaced over-confidence.
 
 
 
 The party began staring at defeat on January 1in Lucknow when the new leaders took over and sidelined Netaji and other party veterans. This became a major factor for its defeat.
 
 You have won against all odds. There were reports that some leaders of your party had appealed for your defeat ...
 
 The love, affection and support of the people of Jaswantnagar could neutralise the hatred and frustration of some of the leaders. I greet my people and promise to serve them till the last breath of my life. I will never leave Jaswantnagar.
