Amritsar: Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu has sought Australian help to market the state’s crops in the international market and bolster tourism. Sidhu, on Sunday, took up these issues with the visiting Australian high commissioner in India Harinder Sidhu. Talking to media persons, Navjot said, “Australia has great strength and technical prowess to market crops in the world market. I have requested the Australian high commissioner to help Punjab market its crops worldwide using Australian expertise and we have been assured all help.”

 He also quoted Neeti Ayog’s recommendation to market   in the world market, which could become a major game-changer for Punjab’s peasantry and liberate farmers from the Minimum Support Price (MSP) circle. He suggested that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh visit Down Under to see how Punjab could benefit from Australian proficiency in the field.
 
 “I will discuss the issue with Amarinder Singh and soon, a delegation will be sent to Australia to know strategies,” he said, adding that Punjab would enter a tie-up with Australia to develop the tourism sector.
 
 “Australia is one of the most sought after destinations and tourist inflow to Amritsar has also risen to 25,000 tourists per day. We need to tap this potential and after taking Australian know-how on this, efforts will be made to bolster tourism,” he said.
 
 Australian high commissioner Harinder said, "Marketing the crop in the world market is a great idea. We in Australia have expertise in this and will look forward to giving ample support to Punjab”.
 
 She said things have been moving ahead between Punjab and Australia in the field of sports and tourism and agriculture also has great potential. “I am also visiting Punjab Agricultural University to gather more information in this field,” she said.
