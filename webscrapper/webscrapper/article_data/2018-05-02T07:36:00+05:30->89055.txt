CHANDIGARH: The   on Tuesday released a detailed programme for conducting elections of 18 municipal committees and made it clear that the model code of conduct will remain effective only in areas where elections are to be conducted.

 Official of the commission said that with the announcement of the election programme on April 20, the model code of conduct has come into operation in areas of municipalities where elections are to be conducted and would remain in force till these are completed.
 
 He said that the commission had noticed that despite the fact that the model code of conduct only remained effective in areas where elections are to be conducted, several government departments, semi-government departments, board, corporations and universities approach this commission for relaxation on certain issues, which results in unnecessary correspondence and delay in programmes and schemes which are out of the ambit of the model code of conduct like issuance of   and permission. To avoid this unnecessary exercise, it has been clarified that the model code of conduct will remain effective only in areas where elections are to be conducted and not in outside areas.
 
 The spokesman said that 18 municipal committees where elections are to be held included Siwani, Bawani Khera and Loharu (Bhiwani), Haily Mandi, Pataudi and Farrukh Nagar (Gurgaon), Narnaund (Hisar), Julana (Jind), Beri (Jhajjar),   and Nilokheri (Karnal), Kalayat (Kaithal),   and Kanina (Mahendergarh), Taoru (Mewat), Hathin (Palwal), Kalanaur (Rohtak), Kharkhoda (Sonepat ) and byelections of two municipalities â€” ward No. 20 of municipal council, Thanesar, (Kurukshetra) and ward No. 4 of municipal committee, Assandh (Karnal).
