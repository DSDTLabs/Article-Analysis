 Nigam was among the first to greet his guru. "We are receiving congratulations from all parts of the world," said the Ustads son Murtuza, who is also his disciple. "Some people are saying that this honour was long overdue. But this is how it is. My father is presently in Lucknow at the invitation of the UP government which will felicitate him. He will return home Saturday."
 
 Khan Sahab received a phone call from a ministry official for his formal acceptance. He replied that it would be an honour to do so.
 
 Murtuza says his father first came to Mumbai from his native Badaun in Uttar Pradesh in 1957 and decided to make the city his karmbhoomi in 1962. 
 
 "Over the years, Khan Sahabs hallmark has been his overpowering excellence, firm secularism and extreme humility. He believes music is a universal language and is versatile in all forms, be it the khayal, dhrupad, khamaj, lokgeet, Sufi, natyasangeet or ghazal. He says these are all chapters of one book which is music," he said.
