New Delhi: A   in   is under the   of the  , allegedly for making its student sit outside the premises, on the  , for   of fees. 

 The Class VIII student, according to his mother, had been going to school from April 2, each day ousted by the administration, until Thursday last week. 
 
 The child lost his father about a year ago, and his mother worked as a help and was unable to pay the fees.
 
 According to the mother of the 12-year-old, while the eldest daughter’s fees was also not paid, her teachers had contributed among themselves to clear the dues and make sure the Class X girl attended school.
 
  “Both my kids were granted 50% fee waiver by the school. But this year, the administration wanted me to start paying his fees in full, which amounts to Rs 60,000 per year,” said the mother, who didn’t wish to be identified.
 
 The mother said she had approached the school to inform them about the inability to pay such a hefty fees, being the only breadwinner of the house. 
 
 “Both they refused to waive fees, like they had earlier. My son used to get dressed everyday because he just wanted to go to school,” she said. 
 
 The public “punishment” for non-payment of dues brought a lot of humiliation to the children and the family, said the mother. 
 
 “I know it is our fault that we can’t pay the fees on time. Par humaari bhi majboori hai,” said the mother. 
 
 The matter was brought to the notice of DCPCR, which is now planning to issue a notice to the school. “I have been given the direction by the chairperson, and a formal notice will be sent to the school by tomorrow,” Jyoti Rathee, a DCPCR member, said.
 
 The administration could not contacted for comment despite calls and email to the school authorities.
