We continued the drive on the road to Sadar Bazar to Shahu College, where 25 sheds were removed. We have also cleared around 30 sheds behind the D Y Patil medical hospital.”
 
 Powar said there was some resistance from the vendors at these illegal sheds and temporary shops; however, they had no valid documents to support their claims.
 
 “We had deployed around 80 police personnel, along with 60 KMC officials, which helped in carrying out the job without much problem,” he said.
 
 Powar said, this is the fourth action taken against illegal shops and vendors this week and the action will continue next week too.
 
 “We will resume the action on Monday. The area, however, is yet to be finalised. We appeal to the citizens not to set up illegal shops or sheds in the corporation limits,” he said.
 
 The KMC had launched an anti-encroachment drive from the last week of December after being slammed by corporators in the civic standing committee meeting for being lenient towards encroachers. This was leading to traffic congestions, the corporators had said. 
 
 On Wednesday, the KMC removed more than 50 cabins and an equal number of signboards on the road from Papachi Tikti to Phulewadi fire station. Around 50 people, including civic officials, fire brigade and police, were involved in the drive.
