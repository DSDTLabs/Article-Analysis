Bokaro:   blew up the house of a para-teacher, beat up his wife and held a jan adalat (kangaroo court) at Baltharwa village atop Jhumra Hill under Mahuataad police station on Monday. 

 The rebels, at least 30 of them, also pasted posters across the village, branding the teacher Jailal Mahto as a police informer. Fortunately, Mahto was not present at his residence at the time of the explosion.
 
 The incident occurred three days after the district administration organised a janta durbar at Jhumra village, at least eight kilometres from the spot. Baltharwa is situated at the highest point of Jhumra Hill and consists of about 15 houses. 
 
 The Maoists arrived and compelled the villagers on gunpoint to come out of their houses. The villagers were then taken to a nearby jungle where the jan adalat was organised. 
 
 After the rebels failed to locate Mahto, they beat his wife Bijli Devi (27) and his father Moti Mahto. The group then blew up Mahto’s house. The family lost all their valuables in the explosion.
 
 Villagers in Baltharwa remained angry with the police for not visiting the spot more than 24 hours after the incident.
 
 However, SP Y S Ramesh said he was aware of the incident but as a precautionary measure, did not send his security men to visit the village.
 
 “The Maoists are perhaps planning to attack our forces when they visit the village. We are taking steps accordingly,” the SP said.
