 When diplomats, politicians and some hoteliers from the capital got together at the French ambassador Alexandre Ziegler’s residence recently, only food was on their minds. At a special event hosted by the ambassador, guests shared their love for French food with each other. Some also shared their stories of travel to different parts of the European country. The event was organised to celebrate the third edition of the global event Goût de France (Good France) on March 21, where 2,000 chefs from across five continents curated a menu featuring French cuisine. In India, more than 65 restaurants were selected to participate. "Out of those, around 14 restaurants are in Delhi. There is growing fondness for French cuisine among Indians, and India is at the top of our list this year. We have organised a special dinner for a select few and chef Akrame Benallal has specially come from Paris and has prepared a special menu for this dinner," said the ambassador.

  Chef Akrame, who visits India often, prepared an all-vegetarian French meal for the ambassador’s special guests. "There are five dishes that will introduce guests to the flavours of the French cuisine. I always try to keep the focus on the main ingredient of the dish,” said the chef. He added that in Delhi, he has been trying food at all the famous places and loves Indian food for the balance of spices in the dishes. “But one thing I love in Indian cuisine the most are the breads, I love naan. I have had naan at popular restaurants in Delhi," he said.
