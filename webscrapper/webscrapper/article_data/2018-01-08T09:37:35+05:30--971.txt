  : Behind a murder, there's supposed to be a motive. In this case, it was a case of just 3,000. And ironically, both the victim and the accused were close friends. 

 The incident occurred in   police station limits on Saturday night, but came to light on Sunday morning after complaints from the kin of the victim. According to the police, Dhana  , a resident of Malkapuram falling under 48th ward of   (GVMC), and   were close friends. They used to eke out a living with doing sundry jobs. A few months back, Prasad had borrowed 3,000 from Raju, but despite repeated proddings did not return the money. 
 
 Raju had been asking him to return his money for the last two months. He had even brought it to the notice of Prasad's family members. 
 
 On Saturday, Raju again asked Prasad to return his money. Prasad then reportedly told Raju that he did not take 3,000 but that the amount was 2,000 only. Prasad said he would clear the due after Sankranti. The tiff led to a quarrel and in a fit of rage, Prasad hit Raju with a wooden log, killing him on the spot. 
 
 On being informed, Malkapuram police reached the spot and collected evidence from the place of crime, including seizure of the murder weapon. 
 
 The police also took Prasad into custody and will send him to the court on Monday to get his judicial custody. 
 
 The police said they will also investigate the case from other angles to find out if there were other issues between the two friends besides the financial dispute. The police also suspect that the quarrel between the two might have occurred under the influence of alcohol.
