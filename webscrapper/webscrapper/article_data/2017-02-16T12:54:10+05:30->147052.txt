NAGPUR: Even though the issue of revoking ‘revised’ property tax did not find place in Nationalist Congress Party’s election manifesto for  , the party said if it came to power it would halve the tax.

 Former Maharashtra minister  , MLC Jogendra Kawade,  , former senior   among others released the party’s manifesto promising freebies and promises related to good roads, better health amenities, CCTV cameras in gardens and parks. 
 
 Speaking to mediamen, Deshmukh admitted the party had failed to include promise to reverse the revised property tax in its manifesto. The former MLA pointed out that the BJP ruled NMC had revised the property tax and it was supposed to be implemented since 2014-15. “But later, the ruling party realized the revision led to steep hike. So they are not allowing the civic administration to distribute invoices as they fear adverse effect in the 2017 civic polls,” he said. Once the elections are over, the citizens would get increased property tax bills, he said.
 
 He further blamed BJP for substandard road works and said it failed to provide 24X7 water supply anywhere in city. Since the BJP-ruled NMC entrusted the supply and maintenance of water supply to a private firm Orange City Water, the service had deteriorated, Deshmukh charged. 
 
 Though Congress had stated it would scrap the Orange City Water contract if it came to power, NCP said it would try to improve the service. 
 
 Taking a potshot at CM Devendra Fadnavis, NCP city president said the BJP-ruled state government had even elevated a local goon to the post of a minister by appointing him as a chairman of Maharashtra Construction Workers Welfare Board.
 
 so one should not expect better law and order situation in Nagpur city.
