Nagpur: The Central Railway will operate eight pairs of trains from the  , No. 8, at the east side (Santra Market) of the station from Monday. This has been made possible due to the Rs37 crore doubling project between Nagpur and Kalamna (6.5km).

 Currently, only two trains — 12289/12290 Nagpur-Mumbai-Nagpur Duronto Express and 22647 Korba-Trivendrum Express — operate from the home platform (platform number 8).
 
 “Now that we have a second corridor, 16 additional trains will arrive on platform number 8 and will also depart from there,” said divisional railway manager (DRM) Brijesh Kumar Gupta.
 
 The trains that will operate from home platform include mail/express trains like Gondia-Kolhapur Maharashtra, Howrah-Mumbai, Puri-Surat, Puri-Ahmedabad, Puri-Gandhidham, Howrah-LTT, Howrah-Porbandar, Howrah-LTT Samrasta, Puri-LTT and Puri-Ajmer. Earlier, all the above trains operated from platform number 3.
 
 Apart from these trains, some trains like 18239 Gadarwada-Nagpur, 12855-12856 Nagpur-Bilaspur, and 18240 Nagpur-Bilaspur will start and terminate at platform number 8.
 
 If operation of the trains has been made possible due to double line work by Nagpur division of South East Central Railway (SECR), the Central Railway too has developed various facilities for passengers on platform number 8, foremost among them being the washable apron to keep the tracks clean.
 
 “The apron has been constructed by spending Rs1.32 crore. Besides, Rs1.40 crore has been spent to cover the platform with roofs. Another Rs40 lakh has been spent to fill water in trains,” said railway officials.
