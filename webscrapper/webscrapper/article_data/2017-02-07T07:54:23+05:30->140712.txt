 It was after almost three hours of sloganeering and siege that university vice-chancellor K P Isaac directed the college authorities to suspend all classes.
 
 Students, parents and a section of student organization leaders staged a protest at KTU after the college management resumed classes with a few students who were willing to pursue their courses at the college.
