MYSURU: Charging the   leadership with being unfair to leaders from the Lingayat and   communities when it came to ticket distribution,   leader Alanahalli   on Wednesday questioned the legitimacy of chief minister Siddaramaiah’s commitment to social justice.

 “Siddaramaiah has been harping about social justice but when it comes to distributing tickets, he has done justice to all communities except the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community,” said Puttaswamy.
 
 The BJP leader questioned the dominance of the Brahmins and Vokkaligas in various constituencies. “In Periyapatna, KR Nagar, Chamaraja constituencies, the Vokkaligas rule the roost, while Brahmins are fielded from the Krishnaraja constituency,” said Puttaswamy.
 
 In the Chamundeshwari constituency, only three leaders from the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community were fielded by the Congress –  , AS Guruswamy and Shivabasappa, he said. “After them nobody from the community has been given a ticket,” added Puttaswamy.
 
 Lashing out at the CM for dividing the community, he said, “Lingayats and Veerashaiva are one and the same. We will not fall prey to divisive politics. His strategy to divide the religion will backfire.”
 
 The BJP leader expressed outrage over the failure on the part of All India Congress Committee president Rahul Gandhi to pay homage to Basavanna. “During his visit to Mysuru, Rahul and   did not garland the philosopher’s statue near Mysuru Palace. The Congress is using Basavanna’s name only for political gains,” he said.
 
 Admitting to being an aspirant for a ticket from Chamundeshwari, Puttaswamy said, “There are more than 40,000 Veerashaiva-Lingayats in Chamundeshwari. Kanya Shivamurthy, and I, are both aspirants. We will abide by the decision taken by the party leadership.”
 
 Puttaswamy said that efforts were under way to field BS Yeddyurappa’s son BY Vijayendra from Varuna constituency. “If he comes here, he will definitely win,” he added.
