GANDHINAGAR: The tug of war between chief minister   and deputy chief minister Nitin Patel seems to be going on even after Patel got the   he was seeking. The friction is likely to intensify as differences between the top two state   leaders widen and are expressed publicly. On Wednesday, at just the second cabinet meeting after the formation of the new government, differences between Rupani and Patel emerged over handling of thec

 A minister, who asked not to be identified, said, “The CM proposed that farmers’ unrest over low groundnut prices be eased by using excess groundnut stock procured by state agencies. The CM proposed that the government plan extraction of oil from groundnut and supply it for use in PDS (public distribution system) rations and MDM (Midday meals). This way the government could use the stock procured last year and find space to store the fresh procurement.
 
 However, Nitinbhai reportedly opposed the move, saying it was not feasible and the government can’t bear the additional cost of extracting oil and distributing it, as it will be more expensive than cotton seed oil. “The CM kept pushing the idea while the deputy CM opposed it, all before ministers and senior secretaries. The CM finally told the officers to look in to the possibilities, to avoid any further discussion,” he said.
 
 “This spat happened in the presence of ministers and senior officers, which is not good for the government and party,” the minister added.
 
 Some ministers and officers also confirmed this development.
 
 A senior officer said, “Two power centres in one government certainly affects governance, as bureaucracy is used to taking command from one point only. It may lead to a chaotic situation in governance.”
