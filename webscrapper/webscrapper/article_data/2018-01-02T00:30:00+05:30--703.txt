Bengaluru: In order to cater to the needs of increasing number of commuters taking the Namma Metro services, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) will introduce 10 additional trips on the Purple Line (Byappanahalli to Mysuru Road) and three on the Green Line (Nagasandra to Yelachenahalli) starting from Tuesday.

 In an official media communication, Mahendra Jain, managing director, BMRCL, said the frequency of the trains will also be increased and there will be trains at 3.5-minute gap during peak hours on the Purple Line. “On the Green Line, the frequency has been increased to six minutes during peak hours. The number of train services have been increased during non-peak hours too,” he added.
 
 It may be recalled that Metro commuters have been complaining about crammed rides inside trains, especially during peak hours, owing to a large number of people using the service. On an average around 2.5 to 3 lakh people use the Metro network every day.
