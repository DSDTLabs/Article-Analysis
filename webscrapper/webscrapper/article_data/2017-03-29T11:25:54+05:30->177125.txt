FAIZABAD/AYODHYA: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is in favour of Supreme Court-monitored negotiation with Hindu parties for out-of-court settlement of the   dispute.

 Talking to TOI, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali, memeber of the executive body of AIMPLB, said, “We are ready to talk if there is opportunity of peaceful negotiation between the two parties. Talks are necessary and we were always ready but before we are on the negotiation table, Supreme Court must chalk out an agenda of the debate and must authorise and nominate the Hindu parties for negotiation.“
 
 Convenor of the   Masjid cell of AIMPLB, Syed Qasim Rasul Ilyas said, “We will talk after Supreme Court monitors the negotiation and gives both parties equal status.“
 
 AIMPLB, the apex body that represents Indian Muslims religiously and socially, is of the opinion that if the talks of negotiation start, it must be protected by the Supreme Court, as in the past, some talks were held but yielded no result and ended up in   and the Muslim side blaming each other for the failure. “The actual reason for the talks not materialising was that the VHP was involved at every stage,“ claimed Khaliq Ahmad Khan, a party in the case.
