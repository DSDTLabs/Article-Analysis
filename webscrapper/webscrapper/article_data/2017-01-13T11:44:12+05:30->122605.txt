LUCKNOW: Political parties have their own slogans reflecting ideology and culture — from BJP’s “Bachcha Bachcha Ram Ka, Janmabhoomi Ke Kaam Ka” which galvanized voters in post-Babri elections to SP-BSP’s “Mile Mulayam Kanshiram, Hawa Ho Gaye Jai Shriram” that stalled in the Ram Temple wave — elections in Uttar Pradesh have been dominated by slogans which many a time prove game-changer as well. 

 The SP and the   have taken the lead by coining new slogans and rephrasing some old ones to build the tempo this time. The one liners of the SP are mostly around  , highlighting the “development” in the past five years. Young men can be seen chanting “Yeh Jawaani Hai Qurbaan, Akhilesh Bhaiyya Tere Naam” and women are not shying from declaring “Hamara Saiyya Kaisa Ho, Akhilesh Jaisa Akhilesh Jaisa”. 
 
 Together, they raise “Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Akhilesh Jai Akhilesh”, “Kaam bolta hai” and “Vikas ka pahiya, Akhilesh Bhaiyya”. In between, they don’t forget Akhilesh’s wife Dimple — “Jeet Kee Chabhi, Dimple Bhabhi”. 
 
 Amid ongoing Yadav family feud, the older lot has rephrased “Jiska Jalwa Kayam Hai, Uske Naam Mulayam Hai (only   has mass appeal)” that brought the SP patriarch to power in 1989 to “Akhilesh Ka Jalwa Kayam Hai, Uska Baap Mulayam Hai”. 
 
 They are expressing their solidarity with slogans — “No Confusion, No Mistake, Sirf Akhilesh, Sirf Akhilesh”, “Akhilesh, Hum Tumhare Saath Hain” and “UP Ki Majboori Hai, Akhilesh Yadav Zaroori Hai”. Full story on P2
