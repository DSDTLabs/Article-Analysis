 The NMC had recently sent seizure notices to ISP and CNP, both units of Security Printing and   (SPMCIL) under the Union finance ministry. 
 
 While the ISP owes Rs 55.68 lakh as tax dues, the CNP owes Rs 5.53 crore to the NMC. On March 4, the NMC had given an ultimatum of eight days to the presses to clear the arrears.
 
 The ISP and the CNP had written to the state government on December 26, 2016, pleading waiver of the property tax on the grounds that they were governed by the central government. The state government dismissed the appeal in a letter to the two printing units and informed the NMC about it through a written copy in January.
