Tirupur: Thanks to the incessant rain, the public works department (PWD) has finally decided to repair the   irrigation tank’s  , which had not been maintained in the last 20 years. The 110-acre  , located adjacent to  , reached its full capacity for the first time in about four decades, surprising even   officials, because its parent tanks have not filled up.

 While the brimming tank was a cause of delight for the local residents, who came along with their families to see it, Srinivasapuram residents were anxious about water breaching the tank walls.
 
 PWD officials who inspected the tank found that the outlet shutter could not be operated because it was not maintained for several years. The department has started work to fix a huge pipe on the outlet of the tank to release excess water. Assembly speaker P Dhanapal inspected the construction work on Saturday.
 
 Meanwhile, GS Ravi, a social worker, who had staged a hunger strike demanding repair of the shutter said, “Even if the shutter is made ready, water cannot be released from the tank properly because the canal that connect Nallaru, a tributary to Noyyal River, is gone.”
 
 The state highways department is also involved in the construction of the outlet as during the construction of an over-bridge, it had overlapped the shutter.
