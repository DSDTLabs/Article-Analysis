Vasco: Hundreds of devotees paid obeisance to lord Damodar on the occasion of the annual Saptah festivities that began on Friday afternoon with the offering of a shreefal (coconut) to the deity, a practice which has been followed over decades. Lord Damodar is the most revered deity of Vascoites. Legend has it that the city was once in the grip of plague epidemic and there was no respite to the people.  Worried and traumatized, a couple of families decided to invoke lord Damodar’s blessings to protect the city from the dreaded disease. They visited lord’s temple at Zambaulim and prayed for his divine intervention to ward off the evil that had gripped the city.  They brought along with them a Shreefal as lord’s symbolic offering and installed it at the temple in Vasco. Their faith deepened in the deity as the city slowly returned to normal.  Saptah (7-day rituals) is performed every year in the month of Shravan, beginning on Shashti (sixth day of the month). Classical singers drawn from all walks of life enthrall the devotees with raagas and bhajan renditions.  Besides, dindi utsavs (procession of devotees singing hymns, bhajans and shlokas to the beats of drums, cymbals and other instruments) by six traditional groups are being carried out with the presentation of floats depicting scenes from Hindu mythology.  Young and old, irrespective of their caste, creed and religion converge at the temple to seek deity’s blessings.  Prominent among those who sought blessings of the lord on Friday include chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, Cortalim MLA, Alina Saldanha, Vasco MLA, Carlos Almeida and priest of St Andrew’s Church, Fr Gabriel Coutinho.
