MUMBAI: Actor   has slammed author   and publishers   for an unofficial biography on him, saying the book is based on "tabloids and gossip magazines" and hurts his family. 

 The actor, whose life story is already being adapted for the big screen by director  , said he is working on his official autobiography and it will be out soon.
 
 "I have not authorised either Juggernaut Publications or Yasser Usman to write/publish my biography. Our lawyers had sent them a legal notice," he said. 
 
 In response to this, Juggernaut Publications said that contents of the proposed book are based on information available in public domain from authentic sources. Usman details the actor's troubled early years, his battle with drugs and his brush with law that landed him in jail. The excerpts of the book have already appeared in the news but Dutt (58) said he hopes the publishers stop sharing more stories from the book. agencies
