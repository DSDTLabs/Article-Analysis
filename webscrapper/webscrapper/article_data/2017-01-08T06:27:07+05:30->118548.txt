 “The house was built by Rayees Jung, son of Fakhrul Mulk, in the 1930s, when Mehdi Nawaz Jung facilitated the inhabitation of Banjara Hills.The next owner was Kazim Nawaz Jung, also known as Ali Pasha, the son-in-law of Mir Osman Ali Khan. It was from him that the seventh Nizam bought it,“ said Shahid Hussain, who served Prince Mukarram Jah in various capacities for two decades.
 
 A member of the Nizam's executive council, Mehdi Nawaz Jung, after whom road number 1 in Banjara Hills is named, was instrumental in facilitating the inhabitation of the area.
 
 Mukkarram Jah stayed in the house before he got married. Others said that the prince moved out after the construction of Chiraan Palace, now in KBR National Park.
 
 “The prince later gifted Barkat Villa to Zaheer Ahmad, a former Hyderabad civil services officer. Ahmad was also ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1973 to 1975. It appears that Ahmad created a trust for his family for his property ,“ a source said.
 
 The Barkat Villa complex, though not on any heritage list, also includes a mosque,  , which was pulled down to make way for a larger structure for worshippers.
