JODHPUR: Barmer MP   has alleged that there is a common practice of   in   wherein the college owners have been minting quick money by facilitating the malpractice in examinations.

 While talking to TOI with reference to an incident wherein the owner of a private college Love Kush Mahavidyalaya from Dudu in Barmer district, Khartaram had beaten up the vice-chancellor of the Jai Narayan Vyas   during an inauguration programme of the incubation centre at the MBM Engineering College on Friday in presence of higher education minister Kiran Maheshwari. Khartaram had alleged that the vice-chancellor has stopped the result of his college students under the pressure of MP Sonaram.
 
 Denying the allegation, Sonaram said that Khartaram was also one of those mafias, who facilitate mass copying in their college and take money from the students.
 
 “He was lying that I had asked the vice-chancellor not to release the result of his college. The results of his college have been stopped due to mass copying,” said Sonaram, adding that Khartaram already has four cases registered against him.
 
 On the other hand, the V-C said that he never got any call from the MP and referred to Khartaram as an education mafia. “The flying squad had made a case of mass copying in his college and an inquiry report had also confirmed the same in Khartaram’s college,” Singh said. He said that the syndicate meeting has been called on July 21 to resolve the matter and consider the cancellation of affiliation of the college as per the direction of the minister Maheshwari.
