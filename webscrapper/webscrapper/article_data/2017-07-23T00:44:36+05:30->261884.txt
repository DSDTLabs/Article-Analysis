MUMBAI: All schools across the state will have to hold the first round of   tests for this academic year on August 18 and 19. To cut down possibility of malpractices, the education department has also defined the timing for schools to hold the  . It is the first year that class IX students of state board schools will also take the tests, according to a circular issued by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training, which conducts the exam. 

 Non state board school principals are concerned on ways to accommodate the tests. “This time CISCE is going to hold tests for classes V and VIII. Additionally, these baseline tests are in two shifts so it can’t be done in school hours and we will lose a working day,” said a school head.
