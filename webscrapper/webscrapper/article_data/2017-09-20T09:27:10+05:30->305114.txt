A stalker in Mumbai made life so terrible for a 24-year-old woman that she abandoned her plans to study there and shifted back to Delhi.

 She had hoped that would put an end to her troubles, but she had not bargained for the nightmare that unfolded.
 
 She has told the   she had moved to Mumbai a few months ago where she had applied to a few colleges and had met many new people. One of them was the youth who later began to stalk her and call her at odd hours. 
 
 He would turn up wherever she went and would send her gifts with messages that he loved her and wanted to marry her, the woman told the police.
 
 Scared he might harm her if she rejected him, she informed her parents who asked her to return to Delhi. The woman reluctantly shifted back to her parents’ home in the national capital.
 
 Things seemed normal for a few days, until the stalker made a comeback. The woman told the police he suddenly appeared when she was out somewhere. She asked him to stop following her, but he remained unrelenting. Police said the man started calling her using different telephone numbers. She blocked all those numbers, but this did not deter him; he continued to bombard her with phone calls from one number after another. It got so bad that she switched off her phone, and then stopped using a cell phone altogether, police said.
 
 When the man found he couldn’t get her on the phone, he began calling up her father and older brother, asking them to hand the phone to her or he would come to their place and create a ruckus. Anxious the stalker might cross the line, the family went to Jafrabad police station where the woman’s statement was taken and a complaint registered.
 
 “A case under sections dealing with stalking and threatening was registered and a special team has been formed to nab the accused. He seems to have fled the capital,” a senior police officer said, adding the youth was a college student pursuing a B.Com degree.
