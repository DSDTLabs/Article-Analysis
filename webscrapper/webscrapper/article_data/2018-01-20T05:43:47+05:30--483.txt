KOLKATA: With the   already getting positive response in the area, the   ( ) has now planned to introduce GPS-controlled electric vehicles to develop a green transport system in the township. There will also be charging stations at short intervals to facilitate easy usage of these vehicles.

 NKDA authorities will organise a competition inviting private companies to come up with the designs of the intelligent e-vehicle charging stations. The designs will be evaluated by an expert panel before being selected. “A charging station for an electric vehicle needs to have an advanced technology. What these stations will look like is also important,” an official said. 
 
 “Normally, an electric vehicle can move about 150km on a single charge. But there is always concern among users that the charge will get drained quickly and the vehicle will stop in the middle of the road. This is the concern that the authorities plan to address,” said an NKDA official. 
 
  
  
 
 NKDA have already introduced bike taxis, e-rickshaws, golf carts and a few electric vehicles in New Town. “The idea is to encourage the use of electric vehicles as much as possible to minimise emission and develop a public transport system that will be green friendly,” said an official. 
 
 Office-goers have welcomed the scheme. “There is a transport problem in New Town, specially in the interiors. Introducing such electric vehicles regularised by the government will help develop a green transport system,” said Tamal Pal, an IT employee.
