CHENNAI: Trashing the government argument that the state-organised   must be seen as `motivational programme' for school students made to attend them,   has declined to lift its ban on compelling students to attend them.

 “Nobody has right to summon students outside the schools, be it on a working day or a holiday. In fact, Section 27 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 prohibits teachers from being deployed in any non-educational activities,“ said a division bench of   R Subramanian.
 
 When Tamil Nadu advocate-general Vijay   submitted that there was nothing illegal about the government organising such function and inviting students to attend them, the special bench retorted: “We do not think so.“
 
 Noting that the court should not be misunderstood as suggesting that motivational programmes should not be organised by the government, the bench said: “We are concerned only with the manner in which the students are brought to the venue, and taken back from the venue, as well as safety of the students when they are seated in the venue.“
 
 When Narayan said the act would apply only to elementary schools and not to high schools or higher secondary schools, the judges said: “No doubt the Act applies on ly to elementary schools and elementary education is defined under Section 2(f) of the Act as education from Class I to VIII. Even assuming that there is no prohibition, we do not think the government can compel attendance of all the students studying in government or aided schools to attend a particular public function along with the teachers, even if it is beneficial to them.“
 
 It was on a PIL from A Narayanan of ChangeIndia that a vacation bench of the court passed an interim order banning mobilisation of schoolchildren for public meetings.
 
 Narayanan relied on an August 30 news report published in TOI stating that on government's instructions, students of many government and private schools in   district had been forced to attend MGR centenary celebrations at VGP grounds in Vandalur.
