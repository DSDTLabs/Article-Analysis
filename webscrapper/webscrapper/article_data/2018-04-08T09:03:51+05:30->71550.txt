HYDERABAD: Madhu (name changed) was only 11-years old when she ran away from her home and reached a nearby railway station. All she wanted then was to go as far as possible from her  . Little did she know that it would turn out to be her life’s worst decision.

 The harsh reality dawned on Madhu when she found herself in a  , days later.
 
 “I was sitting at a railway station crying not knowing what to do next. A stranger walked up to me, showed concern and asked what’s wrong. The lady, a stranger, was almost of my mother’s age and being naïve I told her my situation. She took me to her place, gave me good food, clothes and admitted me in to a private school. I was very happy,” said Madhu, adding that she used to attend a government school even when with her parents.
 
 She added: “One day, the aunty asked me to get ready and said that she would take me out. She then took me to a hotel and left me with an uncle in the room and never came back. He assaulted me and later sent me to a brothel.”
 
 Recalling her life as a sex slave, she said she was tortured at the house. “They used to beat me with belt, throw chilli powder in my eyes, burn me with cigarettes. I thought I would die in that house. Luckily, I was rescued by the police and moved to a safe place.”
 
 Madhu said that she was provided with much needed treatment and was given counselling and proudly announced that after one year of her rescue, she is no more a victim, but a survivor.
