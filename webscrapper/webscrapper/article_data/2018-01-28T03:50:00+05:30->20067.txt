Visakhapatnam: A 36-year-old yoga teacher was murdered by four assailants near a private school at Marripalem police quarters close to NSTL on National Highway-16 in the late hours of Friday. This was the second   in the city in the last 48 hours. Police said jealousy out of an extramarital affair could be the reason behind the killing and suspect the role of a vernacular scribe.

 The deceased has been identified as Polamarasetti Venkata Ramana of Marripalem, who was running a yoga training centre. The deceased is survived by ex-wife Satyaveni and living partner Padma and a two-year-old son. Satyaveni divorced Ramana, who developed a relationship with Padma.
 
 Padma is his live-in partner and she too is a yoga and dance teacher. Even before getting divorce from Satyaveni, yoga teacher has been maintaining the relationship with Padma, who took divorce from her husband one and half year ago. The yoga teacher was staying with Padma and his son.
 
 The deceased person Venkata Ramana was a yoga teacher in Vietnam. He was stranded here after a police case lodged against him in Gopalapatnam police station following a dispute with Kilaparthi Venkata Ramana. Cops seized the pass port of the Polamarasetti Venkata Ramana and he was forced to stay in the city since one year. The main accused Kilaparthi Venkata Ramana’s son Eswara Rao is also a yoga teacher in Vietnam but he is not as popular as Polamarasetti Venkata Ramana. Polamarasetti Ramana had come to Vizag from Vietnam after his mother’s sudden demise. 
 
 Kilaparthi, the prime accused, is a bureau chief of a vernacular newspaper.
