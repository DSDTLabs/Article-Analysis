MYSURU: The new vice-chancellor for   will be selected in New Delhi early next week. 

 The search panel constituted for selecting the names of three professors for the top post will meet at UGC on May 22. The panel is expected to complete the formalities during its second sitting. During their first meeting in Bengaluru on May 12, the panel members vetted over 150 applications and shortlisted 20 names. 
 
 The shortlisted professors are making all-out efforts to get the post. Mysuru-based retired Kannada professor C P Siddashrama has emerged as the front-runner.
 
 Sources in UoM told TOI that the panel’s second meeting has been scheduled for May 22 at the UGC’s office in the national capital. “This is for the first time in the history of UoM that a search panel is meeting in Delhi,” they noted.
 
 The panel is headed by former VC H P Kincha. While two members of the panel — professor  , who is the VC of Central University (Kalaburagi) and  , who is in charge of UGC — attended the first meeting, another member  , who is former chief of UGC, was absent. Sources said that Gautham, being unwell, could not travel then. 
 
 As both Gautham and Chauhan are from Delhi, it was decided to hold the second meeting in the national capital, they noted. While Kincha is the nominee of the state government, Chauhan is UGC representative, Hari Gautham is nominee of UoM and Maheshwaraiah is the governor’s nominee.
 
 The VC’s post has been lying vacant ever since K S Rangappa demitted office after completing his four-year term on January 10. After Rangappa demitted the office, Yeshwanth Dongre served as in-charge VC for six weeks. Professor   has officiating as the VC since February 20. The panel shortlisted 12 names, of which three were finalized after a discussion, sources added.
