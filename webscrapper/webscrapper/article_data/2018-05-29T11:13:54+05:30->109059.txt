JAIPUR: High voltage drama has become synonymous with the meetings at the   ( ). On Monday, dramatic scenes were once again witnessed during the 7th executive committee (EC) meeting, which was chaired by the city mayor   for the first time after he joined the post.

 
 The drama begun when   councillor   entered the meeting hall and demanded to sit for discussions. However, acting on mayor's directions, marshals forcefully took him out, due to which meeting remained suspended for more than half-an-hour.
 
 Dharam Singh accused the mayor of adopting a dictatorial method against Congress councillors. Following this he staged a dharna outside JMC headquarters and raised slogans against the mayor. Singh alleged, “I was invited for the meeting as I am the officiating leader of opposition. The mayor is solely responsible for not carrying out development work in the city.”
 
 As meeting was called for the first time after the chairpersons of the working committees were appointed, many councillors who were appointed for post came down heavily on the JMC administrative officials.
 
 Councillors alleged that officials are shielding illegal construction in the   area and this had led to serious tampering with heritage. In the meeting, councillor Kusum Yadav also pointed out to illegal construction at Mani Ram Ji Kothi. Acting on the information, the mayor directed the   (West) zone commissioner to investigative the matter.
 
 Meanwhile, during the meeting civil contractors who are on strike for three days gathered at JMC and raised slogans against the city mayor. Contractors alleged that JMC has not cleared the dues of Rs 125 crore and despite several reminders the mayor is not paying heed to their demand.
