LUDHIANA: After the city bus services operator had raised the demand for increasing the fares, officials of the bus service have compiled a report of fares in other cities. Since all cities have bus fares more than Ludhiana, officials have claimed that the fare can be increased, but the final decision would be taken up by the board of directors. However, the bus operator has also proposed the new rates on city bus routes.

 In the previous board of directors meeting on May 21, the operator Horizon Connect Transways Private Limited had asked for revision of bus fares due to the steep increase in diesel rates. The board of directors of   (LCBSL) had then asked the officials concerned to prepare a fare chart of other cities. The city bus officials collected the fare chart from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, and Jaipur. In Jaipur, people shell out Rs7 up to 2km; in Delhi, it is Rs7 up to 4km; in Mumbai, Rs8 up to 2km; and in Chandigarh, charges are double that of Ludhiana â€” Rs10 up to 5km. Moreover, Punjab Roadways is charging Rs1.10 per km from commuters. Here, people are paying Rs5 up to 5km for travelling in city buses.
 
 The city bus manager Baljit Singh said they had sent their report to the MC commissioner   for further action. However, the MC chief said they would bring this report in a meeting with the board of directors of LCBSL for the final decision. He said bus fares will increase only when the board of directors give their approval. Meanwhile, the private operator has already prepared a new fare chart for various routes, and he will also put this in front of the board of directors for approval.
