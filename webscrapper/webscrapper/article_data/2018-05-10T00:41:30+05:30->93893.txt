MUMBAI:   was water-logged in peak summer on Wednesday as 6 lakh litres of water flowed out of a major   when it underwent repairs for a  . The water wasted was enough to have served the needs of around 3,000 people for a day, assuming a daily per capita consumption of 200 litres.

 The   hydraulics department began the repairs on Wednesday, a day after the leak was identified. 
 
 Many people, especially office-goers from the area, took to social media to voice their surprise over the  , some even taking a dig at the BMC for the flooding in the absence of heavy rain, especially when it was a month before the scheduled arrival of the monsoon. 
 
 A tweet on @RoadsOfMumbai said: “Flooding at Elphinstone Road, that too without any rains! Looks like authorities are preparing us for the monsoons.”
 
 The BMC said that repair work was on in full swing. 
 
 “It is a 1,200 mm main Tansa west water pipeline in which leakage was noticed by some locals,” an official from the hydraulic department said. They informed our department, which started working on it from Wednesday. We started repairs on the pipeline without any kind of excavation and instead workers went inside the pipeline through a manhole nearby and repaired the same.”
 
 The repair in the pipeline caused a delay in the water supply in the nearby localities. “There will be no water cut; only the supply to the localities around the pipeline would be delayed,” the official said.
 
 The city receives its water from seven lakes, Tulsi and Vihar in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park within the city limits, and Upper Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tansa, Middle Vaitarna and Bhatsa, all outside the city limits. 
 
 Municipal officials said that every day around 38,000 lakh litres of water is brought to the city from the seven lakes. As a result of a good monsoon last year, there are no water cuts imposed on the city so far.
