GURUGRAM: The interrogation of inspector Jasmer Singh, who has been suspended for his alleged role in the fake  , revealed that two CRPF troopers deployed at the force’s shooting range in Kadarpur were also part of the racket. 

 Interrogators said the CRPF jawans were under the scanner of the special investigation team (SIT), which had already secured the custody of Jasmer, former in-charge of arms licence branch in Gurgaon. The SIT on Wednesday recovered a fake no objection certificate (NOC), which was purportedly issued by the district magistrate of Punjab’s Tarantaran in the name of one Balbir Singh from Jasmer. According to the interrogators, Jasmer used it to buy a weapon that was later sold to a Lucknow resident. The SIT also recovered the bill amounting to Rs 2,77,000 from him.
 
 “The scam kingpin, Manish Bhardwaj alias Kala, and inspector Jasmer were fond of shooting, and the duo visited the CRPF’s Kadarpur shooting range many a time for practice. Meanwhile, they got in touch with two CRPF jawans who later reportedly helped them get arms licences re-registered on fake NOCs. They also helped someone buy weapons through Kala and Jasmer. We are investigating their role in the scam. If found guilty, action will be taken against them as per the law,” ACP Anil Yadav, SIT head.
 
 Inspector Jasmer Singh confessed to having sold illegal weapons. 
 
 The SIT has already sought the court’s nod to conduct polygraph test on ASI Kumar. Bhardwaj had told police that he used to give “shares” to the four police officers booked in the case every time a licence was issued. Bhardwaj told interrogators that he paid Rs 50,000-1 lakh per licence to both Jasmer and ASI Virender Singh.
