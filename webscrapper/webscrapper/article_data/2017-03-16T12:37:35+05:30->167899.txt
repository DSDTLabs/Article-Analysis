PANAJI:   did not disappoint their legion of fans, or the unusually big contingent of travelling mediapersons, as the former champions rode on  's hat-trick to floor   4-2 in a   Group `B' clash at   in Bambolim on Wednesday.

 With Mizoram and Punjab fielding strong sides, and Maharashtra proving to be an unpredictable force, three points were a must for former champions Kerala and they appeared to have stumbled at the start. A defensive lapse from Lijo S allowed Santosh a chance to have the first attempt on goal in the 17th minu te and the Railways striker did not disappoint with the goalkeeper at his mercy .
 
 Kerala didn't expect such a start but they soon found their way back. It was the impressive youngster Nishon Xavier who found space on the right and his cross right into the goalmouth was enough for Jobby to head home. Jobby's second was even better, and it came just a minute before the change of ends. Railways captain Rajib Boro handled the ball just outside the box in added time and Jobby stunned everyone with his powerful freekick that landed straight into the nets. In the second session, Kerala were comfortable with the ball. Jobby and Usman, returning to the fold after two years, combined well and they seemed to have the match in their pocket when Jobby turned home a corner to score his third goal of the match in the 63rd minute.
