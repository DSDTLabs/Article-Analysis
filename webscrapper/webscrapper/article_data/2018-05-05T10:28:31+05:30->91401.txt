VIJAYAWADA: A political slugfest broke out between the ruling TDP and   parties on Friday over the Dachepalli rape. While YSRC MLAs alleged that TDP leaders were behind most rape cases in AP, TDP gave it back saying all the members of the rapist’s family were associated with YSRC.

 
 YSRC MLAs RK Roja, Mohammad Mustafa, Alla Ramakrishna Reddy and other leaders visited Guntur GGH where the victim is being treated. Tension prevailed as cops did not allow the huge gathering to enter the hospital. Speaking to reporters, Roja said the accused was a TDP worker, which was why the government had delayed action. She further alleged that 45 rapes have been reported in the last 45 days in AP.
 
 Responding to allegations, TDP’s Gurajala MLA   come out with a flexi of  , son of Subbaiah’s brother. The flexi was put up by Saidelli to greet Jaganmohan Reddy and Gurajala in-charge Kasu Mahesh Reddy. Rao said all members of Subbaiah family were active members of the YSRC.
