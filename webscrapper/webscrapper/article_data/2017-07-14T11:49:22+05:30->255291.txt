PUNE: A group of more than 30 activists of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ), the student’s wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), created a   in   of   education Dhanraj Mane’s   at the central building here on Thursday afternoon. 

 The protesters were demanding Mane’s suspension over his involvement in the alleged irregularities in a recruitment drive that was carried out in 2012 by the Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (BAMU). Mane was then registrar of BAMU. 
 
 The police have arrested 26 ABVP activists following a complaint lodged by Mane. All of them were produced before a court that ordered their release on bail, an official from the Bund Garden police said. 
 
 “We have charged them for offences under Sections 143, 147, both relating to rioting, 353 (obstructing public servant from carrying out his duty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 503 (criminal intimidation) and Section 37 (1) and 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act besides Section 3 of the enactment against damage to public property,” the official said. 
 
 The protesters tried to damage chairs and furniture in the office, hurled files around the room and raised slogans demanding Mane to vacate his position apart from raising slogans against   minister Vinod Tawde. 
 
 Earlier, the state government had assigned an inquiry committee under assistant director V R More. The panel had submitted its report indicting Mane for the alleged irregularities. The students’ wing has since been demanding action against him. 
 
 In April this year, Tawde had announced that Mane would be placed under suspension and a departmental probe would be initiated. The protesters were agitated over the fact that three months after the announcement, no action was taken against the senior official.
