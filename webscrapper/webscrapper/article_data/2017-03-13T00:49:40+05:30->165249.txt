GURUGRAM:   is about to start construction of the remaining portion of   ( ), having cleared the last hurdle — rehabilitation of   of Rambir Ki Dhani.

 A completed SPR will resolve the connectivity problems of new sectors 58-80 and connect   with NH-8, reducing the traffic load on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway. 
 
 The 16km-long SPR, which originates from Gurgaon-Faridabad road near Ghata and meets NH-8 near Kherki Dhaula via Sohna road, was held up over rehabilitation of 14 oustees at Rambir Ki Dhani, obstructing the road for a 500m stretch. Huda has now rehabilitated the SPR oustees in Sector 49, paving the way for completing the city’s important infrastructure project.
 
 “Oustees have been allotted alternative plots in Sector 49. Now, the land will be cleared and work on the remaining 500m of road will be completed at the earliest,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav, adding work will begin from March-end.
 
 Huda had conducted a draw for the SPR oustees in August 2016. However, oustees, who were given alternative plots as per the state government’s Relocation and Rehabilitation Policy, filed a petition in high court demanding benefits in accordance with the final terms of settlement prepared in May 2015 for oustees of Northern Peripheral Road ( ).
