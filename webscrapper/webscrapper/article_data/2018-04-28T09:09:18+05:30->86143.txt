The   (PMC) may have merged 11 of the 34 proposed fringe villages, but it has no plan in place for providing water to these hamlets.
 
 The villages include  , Keshavnagar, Sadesataranali, Phursungi, Uruli Devachi, Undri, Dhayari, Ambegaon Khurd, Ambegaon Budruk, Shivane and  .
 
 
 The PMC had prepared a report on “Water for Pune’s Future 24x7 Water Supply Project” in 2013. According to the plan, a decision to construct a total of 113 overhead water tanks was taken way back in 2016 and work order were issued for 82 of them on September 23, 2016. The contractor has 30 months to complete the project.
 
 On being asked about the water supply to the fringe villages, PMC superintending engineer   (water supply) said, “We are planning to appoint a consultant for preparing a detail project report (DPR) for these 11 villages merged into the PMC. The process of preparing the report will take around a year. After receiving the report, we will place it in the general body meeting to seek necessary sanction for launching an independent water supply scheme for these villages.”
 
 He added, “The PMC has reserved Rs 11 crore for undertaking developmental work in these fringe villages.”
 
 Cantonment water works executive engineer   said the civic body has inspected the reduce level — the point till where the water reaches on hill tops — to ensure faster pressure can be maintained for reaching the overhead tanks constructed over there.
 
 “The tanks will supply water to a section of people in a limited area. A new cell has been opened to ensure equal distribution of water and consumers will have to pay as per the meter reading,” he said.
