HYDERABAD: Even before the state government starts distribution of 80 lakh   among Yadavas and Kurmas, the scheme has kicked up a row among the beneficiary communities.

 Enquiries by TOI revealed that there are over 3,900 existing Primary Sheep Breeders Cooperative Societies comprising 2 lakh members in the state. Yadavas and Kurmas in these societies are now unwilling to allow enrolment of new members from their own communities.
 
 “We registered our society 20 years ago and waited so long to avail government benefits. How can anyone join today and take away or share the benefits deserved by long-waiting members like us? Let the government first distribute sheep to the existing members of societies and cover the new members in the second phase,” said   (Yadav) of Mallikarjuna Sheep Breeding Society, Meedikonda village in Station Ghanpur mandal, Jangaon district.
 
 As per the Telangana Cooperative Societies Act, 1964 (AP Cooperative Societies Act adopted after formation of Telangana), the existing societies have members not only from Yadava and Kurma communities but also from Reddys, Kammas, Muslims, SCs and STs who rear sheeps. The TRS government wants to distribute sheep only among Yadavas and Kurmas and the sub-sects of the two communities.
 
 Animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav told TOI that he was not aware of the differences cropping up among Yadavas and Kurmas about enrolment of new members. He asserted that the government will ensure that every eligible beneficiary would be given one unit of sheep comprising 20 females and a ram. “Sheep rearers other than Yadavas and Kurmas who are members of the societies are already covered under an earlier scheme, as part of which Rs 398 crore were released by the  ,” the minister said.
