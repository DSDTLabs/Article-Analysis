MUMBAI: Kanpur zoo last month agreed to give a pair of swamp deer to   zoo in exchange for a pair of African Grey and Military Macaw. Three male and five female penguins were brought to Byculla zoo from COEX Aquarium, Seoul, in  , in July 2016.

 But it will take a while before the birds can be exchanged as the zoo authorities said tenders for construction of enclosures are still to be finalized. For a swamp deer, a large enclosure of over 3,000 sq metres will have to be constructed too. Civic officials said they were keen on getting one male and one female deer, and correspondence with Kanpur zoo in  , has been on since long. “Last month, they agreed to give us the swamp deer. They will be brought in once the enclosures are ready,” said an official.
 
 As part of a zoo revamp, the authorities have for the third time floated tenders for constructing 17 enclosures for jackals, tigers, leopards and sambars, among others, at a cost of Rs 116 crore. “The tenders are in the final stages and have been sent for administrative approval,” said the official.
 
 The tenders have been floated in two phases. For the first phase, it is learnt, the lowest bidder is Highway Construction, which had been questioned for submitting allegedly bogus documents for construction of the penguin exhibit at the zoo. The second phase is likely to be awarded to Skyway. But the zoo authorities are seeking the approval of higher administrative authorities before forwarding the proposal to the standing committee for approval.
 
 It is learnt that of the seven acres taken over from Mafatlal Industries, possession of which is yet to be received by  , there are plans for an exotic zoo, which will have an African savannah too.
