Tirunelveli: Suresh Kumar Raghuwanshi, a farmer from Pipariya in Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, pulls a trolley with one hand and holds a placard in the other hand. The 59-year-old man has walked over 2,400km in this fashion as part of his National Unity Foot Journey to Kanyakumari. 

 He covered Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh before reaching Tamil Nadu. On Tuesday, Raghuwanshi was crossing Tirunelveli, showing his placard to curious onlookers. 
 
 “In 2006, I walked from Pipariya to Kashmir, covering around 2,000km in 43 days,” he said. Raghuwanshi began his journey to Kanyakumari on December 1 last. He set off on foot with six shirts, four trousers, a foldable bed, dry fruits and a few other items placed on his trolley and Rs 10,000 in hand. 
 
 Unlike many long distance walkers who prefer walking after the sunset, he walks from 6am to 7pm. “Taking the message to people is more important than covering more distances. So I walk during the day,” he said and added that he covers 35km to 40km a day. Suresh sleeps at railway stations, temples, fuel stations, toll plazas and dhabas. The next morning, he sets off after filling his bottles with water. He walks continuously, with short breaks for breakfast and lunch. 
 
 On Tuesday, he was sporting a new pair of shoes. “This is the sixth pair. Five pairs have already retired,” he said with a laugh.
 
 But for his vision problem, his extensive walking and diet have helped him stay fit without any lifestyle diseases. The farmer, who has studied only up to Class XI, said his wife, Sandhya Raghuwanshi, was very supportive of his initiative. The couple cultivates wheat, varieties of dhal and channa for a living.
 
 On the purpose of his walk to Kanyakumari, he said he was depressed over people fighting over religious grounds. “India is a land of Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians and other religions. We should live together,” he said.
