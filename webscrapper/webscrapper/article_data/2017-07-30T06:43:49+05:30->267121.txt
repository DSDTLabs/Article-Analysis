GANDHINAGAR:  , the former leader of the opposition and rebel Congressman, visited flood-affected areas of Banaskantha on Saturday and targeted the Congress for whisking MLAs away to Karnataka when they were required to be at hand in Gujarat during the natural calamity.   said, “Banaskantha MLAs need to be among people at this critical time. The Congress must trust their MLAs and send them back to Banaskantha. I am not concerned what the Congress does but as MLAs they have to be among people.” Chief minister Vijay Rupani’s tweet echoed the sentiment: “Unfortunately, our friends in the Congress are insensitive about people’s suffering. They are relaxing in resorts in Karnataka.” But a picture of Vaghela having lunch, amid luxury, with former Congress MLA   drew criticism in social media on Saturday.
