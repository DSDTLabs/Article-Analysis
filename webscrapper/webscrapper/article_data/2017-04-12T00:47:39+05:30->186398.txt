NEW DELHI: AAP is going all out to woo the  . It has made them a range of promises from the regularisation of their jobs to regular salaries by the 7th of every month. The party is likely to put these down in its manifesto. 

 These sanitation staff have been the hardest hit by the financial crisis in the civic bodies. They have gone on strike many times in the past even as the BJP-led east and north corporations traded barbs with the AAP-led Delhi government, each blaming the other for the crisis. 
 
 At present, there are 55,226 people with permanent safai karamcharis jobs. Of them, north corporation has 17,008, east has 19,048 and south has 17,400. Additionally, there are around 30,000-40,000 safai karamcharis who are on contract. 
 
 AAP might offer to deliver salaries directly to the bank accounts of these workers. Apart from that, it has been learnt from sources that the party might offer to open fixed deposits for the welfare of the children of these staff. 
 
 This may be on the lines of the Ladli Yojana, and girl children of these staff may get the money on turning 21. 
 
 Another benefit that AAP may promise to the sanitation staff is health insurance and a cashless card for healthcare expenses.
 
 Safety gear, rest rooms near garbage depots with drinking water and fans are other promises that AAP might promise in its manifesto, which is being firmed up.
