TV show 'Mere Angne Mein’s  ' —   — has decided to opt out of the show. The seasoned actress, who has a career spanning 28 years in the industry, says she was bored and wanted to explore newer opportunities. She said, “I do not have much to do on the show. I have no issues with the production house as they have tried their best. However, now I’ve got another offer which I could not resist. My track is likely to end by March.”
What about her differences with actress  ? Is that one of the reasons for her decision to quit? “No. There are issues and I want to resolve them, but when one person is willing to cross the bridge, the other too has to make an effort. She doesn’t seem inclined to want to do that. I will not say I am quitting because of her but there are multiple reasons,” says Ananya.
 
  
  
 
 Krutika says, “We had differences between us right after the show completed two months. It’s almost two years now and she could not have possibly quit the show because of this reason alone.” Ask her why she did not try to mend the issues and she says, “I believe it’s better to be quiet and focus on 
 work than get into unnecessary arguments. We are both 
 professional and this has never affected the show.”
