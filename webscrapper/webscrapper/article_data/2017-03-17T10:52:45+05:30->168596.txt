Thakur was well acquainted with the victim and her family members, and used to visit their house frequently.”
 
 She added, “On the night of April 20, 2015, a neighbour rushed to the victim’s home and informed her parents that he had spotted Thakur with their girl going to a deserted area outside the village.

Upon seeing the villagers, Thakur tried to escape from the spot but the villagers managed to nab him. They later handed over him to police and a case was registered against him.”
 
 A total of nine witnesses were examined during the hearing and based on their statements, the court convicted Thakur.
