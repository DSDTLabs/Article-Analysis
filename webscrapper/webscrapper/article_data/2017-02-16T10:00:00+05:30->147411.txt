Charles M. Schulz, the creator of the 
 comics, once said, “All you need is love. But a little   now and then doesn’t hurt”. Researchers now concur with the second part of the statement, especially since numerous studies have highlighted the   benefits of chocolate. In fact, the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of chocolate are well established and widely acknowledged. A recent meta-analysis of the various studies and clinical trials examining the effects of chocolate on   has further strengthened the evidence for chocolate being healthy.

 The meta-analysis included seven studies with results from over 100,000 subjects with or without heart disease. Results were compared between two groups: subjects who consumed more chocolate and those whose consumption of chocolate was limited. Since several studies were included in the analysis, differences in the study designs were accounted for so that the results were unbiased. Out of seven studies, the results of five studies indicated a positive association between higher chocolate consumption have the risk of developing heart disease. Indeed, compared with low chocolate consumers, people who ate a lot of chocolate were 37% less likely to develop heart disease, and 20% suffer from stroke. However, these studies doesn’t compare the benefits of milk and  , and included commercially available variants of chocolate like desserts, drinks and biscuits. The researchers also cautioned against taking these results at face value, since the high fat and sugar content of regular chocolate could negotiate
  the health benefits of chocolate when consumed in large quantities, resulting in diabetes and heart disease. 
 
 Think of chocolate as  , and you will never feel guilty about succumbing to your craving for that extra piece!
