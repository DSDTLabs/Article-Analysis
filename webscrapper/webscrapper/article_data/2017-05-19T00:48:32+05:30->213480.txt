Trichy: A survey released on Wednesday by the ministry of railways rating the cleanliness of stations in the country has disappointed commuters in Trichy division as most stations under it have fared poorly this year. Kumbakonam which was adjudged the fifth cleanest   station in the country last year slipped to 40th position while Trichy, Thanjavur junctions and Mayiladuthurai also went down. Meanwhile, members of rail users associations have raised doubts about the way the survey was conducted since no drastic changes had occurred in these stations in a year.

 Though the temple town of Kumbakonam plunged to 40 in national ranking for cleanliness, it retained the top position in south zone ranking. Villupuram station which secured the 110th rank was placed ninth in zonal level followed by Trichy railway junction. 
 
 Trichy which came within 15 ranks last year plummeted to 137 this year and 13th at zonal level. Thanjavur, which also falls under Trichy division, got the 158th rank in the country and 18th at zonal level. Mayiladuthurai, another station coming under the division, got the 323rd all India rank while it stood 45th at the zonal level. 
 
 Meanwhile, A Giri, vice-president, Thanjavur District Rail Users Association, said that no drastic change was effected in the cleaning work at Kumbakonam station in the past one year. Railways had not provided any advanced equipment to improve the present condition of the station. However, the cleaning work was carried out at par with the previous year. A health official in Kumbakonam station said they were shocked to hear that the station’s ranking had dipped to 40. “We have been doing the same thing that we did during the previous year. However we lost the ranking. We don't know how it happened", he said.
