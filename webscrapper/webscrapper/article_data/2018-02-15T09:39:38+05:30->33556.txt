AGARTALA: AICC general secretary and former chief minister of Maharashtra,  , in a press conference here on Wednesday, appealed to the people of Tripura to reject   in the upcoming assembly election to stall the saffron party's growth across the country. 

 Accompanied by ex-chief minister of Uttarakhand, Harish Rawat, and leader of the opposition in Assam, Debabrata Saikia, Chavan - who is on a day-long visit to Agartala to campaign for   candidates - claimed that BJP, because of its communal politics, has already lost many of its alliance partners ahead of the crucial 2019 general election. "The alliance partners of BJP in Bihar, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have stepped back because of the dominant role of BJP and the dictatorial attitude of its leaders. The good performance of Congress in Gujarat assembly poll and Rajasthan Lok Sabha byelection gives a clear indication of downfall of BJP in the country," Chavan said.
 
 "I urge the electorate to vote against both CPM and BJP and choose Congress to bring a meaningful change in the politics of the country. The saffron party is guided by the principles of RSS, which tries to control people's dress, food and social practices, that is against the spirit of Indianness," Chavan stated.
 
 Claiming that BJP's alliance with the IPFT(NC) betrays their politics of dividing the country on ethnic and religious lines, Chavan said inclusive development is the ultimate agenda of Congress. 
 
 Reacting to Chavan, BJP's Tripura election in-charge Himanta Biswa Sarma told media that Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, are working for CPM to divide opposition votes in the state. He said though Congress is trying to provide impetus to its campaign by roping in leaders like CP Joshi and Prithviraj Chavan, the party lacks a distinct presence except for its few party flags visible along thoroughfares.
