Vijayawada: A rock-cut Buddhist   dating back to 1st century AD was discovered at  , Vijayawada east assembly constituency on Wednesday.

 The cave first came to the notice of local MLA Gadde Rama Mohan Rao, during his ‘gadapa gadapaku Telugu Desam,’ a door-to-door party tour. After spotting the cave, he alerted Buddhist archaeologist and CEO of Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati Dr E Sivanagi Reddy.
 
 Dr Reddy thoroughly explored the cave. He told TOI that the rock–cut cave has an open verandah measuring 20 feet by 12 feet, a mandapa (15x12ft) and a cell (8x6 ft). The cell is believed to the residence of the chief monk, which acted as a retreat (vassavasa) during rainy season, which lasted for about four months.
 
 “The cave bears historical significance in the field of Buddhist cave architecture in the Deccan region. With this cave, Vijayawada will find a place in the Buddhist circuit map of India,” Dr Reddy said. Based on the plain nature of the rock–cut cave and the absence of ornamental motifs, Dr Reddy said the cave dates back to 1st century AD, which makes it part of the Satavahana period.
 
 The Buddhist cave was chiselled from a rock of the Gunadala hill. It was appropriated by the Brahmanical faith during the 7th and 8th centuries (Vengi Chalukyan period) when Buddhism was on its decline. The cave was re-fashioned with octagonal pillars on either side and the walls were smoothened. 
 
 The locals said a small figure of goddess Kanaka Durga was installed in recent times and they called it Kanaka Durga cave.
 
 Gadde Rama appealed the archaeology officials to declare it as a protected site and develop it as a tourist spot by erecting a sign board and directional board on the roadside in Gunadala.
