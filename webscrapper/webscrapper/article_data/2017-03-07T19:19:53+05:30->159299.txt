With a series of personal pictures of actors being shared on the Twitter handle of Singer 
  Karthik, amidst speculations and allegations of the account being hacked, the pictures that were leaked are doing the rounds for obvious reasons. 

 Interestingly, though the pictures of Hansika, actor Dhanush, Singer-cum-actor Andrea Jeremiah and music director Anirudh Ravichander were up on the Suchitra's Twitter handle, what caught our attention was the latest picture of our 'Bhallaladeva' Rana Dagguabti, who was seen planting a kiss on actress  's cheek. The picture, of course looks lovely and is understandably a selfie. 
 
 
 
 While Rana is rumoured to have dated many of his co-actresses, the relationship he shared with Trisha was open to public. The duo were seen hanging out often and never missed a chance to catch up whenever they are either in Chennai or Hyderabad. Back then, when Trisha's father Krishnan passed away in Hyderabad, it was only Rana from the film fraternity that stood beside her throughout.
