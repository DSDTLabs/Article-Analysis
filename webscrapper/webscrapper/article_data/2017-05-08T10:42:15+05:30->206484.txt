PUNE: Calling for a mindset change, Union HRD minister   on Sunday exhorted "a section of the media" to give due coverage to the positive changes happening in society instead of just latching on to the negatives. 

 "The nation is going through a change. Owing to the progress over the last three years, after the BJP-led government came to power at the Centre, even the poor in this country have got hope. If the media fails to reflect this transformation, they will be left behind as far as catching the pulse of the public is concerned,"   said, while speaking at the J S   memorial lecture.
 
 The lecture was organised by the   on the topic 'Changing Nation and Role of Media.'
 
 "Steps like demonetisation, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the surgical strike, removal of red beacon from the VIP vehicles have garnered public support. But a section of media is not giving these initiatives due importance," Javadekar said. 
 
 While holding the freedom of media as paramount, the minister asked "the who's who in the media sector" to introspect on whether this freedom is being used properly.
