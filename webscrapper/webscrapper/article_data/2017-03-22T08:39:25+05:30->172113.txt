In a first for India, we will cover autistic children,“ said Dr  , additional director of public health and preventive medicine, who is in charge of the   Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. “The coverage is extensive under the new scheme. We will be covering heart and lung transplants, cochlear implant, bone marrow transport, radiation therapy , surgical oncology . Another first is that the new scheme will cover bariatric surgery for the morbidly obese,“ said Selvavinayagam.
 
 The coverage for surgical procedures has been increased to around `2 lakh from around `1.5 lakh. “But if the surgery or treatment procedure for critical illness ex ceeds the insured limit, we have set up a corpus fund to pay for the entire treatment,“ said Selvavinayagam.
 
 Another first is the attempt to insure the health of migrant workers and orphans. Access to healthcare has been denied to many longterm residents of Tamil Nadu because of lack of documentation, address and residence proof. With such efforts, the state hopes to reach out to undocumented or little documented workers and their children.
