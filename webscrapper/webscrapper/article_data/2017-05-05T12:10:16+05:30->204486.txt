PATNA:   Men’s Association president   and joint secretary   were arrested by the Patna police in an inebriated condition on  .
 
  Police said they were arrested from the New Police Line at Lodipur in the city after the   police station got a tip-off about them. Police officials, however, were tightlipped when asked if they were consuming liquor on the Police Line premises. Liquor bottles were not recovered from the duo’s possession, the officials said.
  
  The Nitish Kumar government legislated against drinking and declared Bihar a dry state on April 5 last year.
  
  Buddha Colony police station SHO Manoj Mohan said he got a call around 11.30pm against two drunk people creating a nuisance at the Police Line. “A police team rushed to the spot and arrested the shouting duo. They were later identified as Singh and Khan,” the SHO said, adding they were taken to the PMCH for medical examination which confirmed alcohol content in their blood.
  
  The duo were sent to jail by a local court where they were produced on Thursday morning. They are natives of Bihiya in Bhojpur district.
  
  Association general secretary Narendra Kumar Dheeraj termed the arrests as an embarrassment to the association that represents police constables of the state. “Policemen should shun liquor addiction. We are government employees and we must abide by the prohibition law,” he said.
