Panaji: The water resources department is hoping that the grounded vessel, M V Lucky Seven, will be removed from the Miramar Beach before August-end so that they can safeguard the beach from getting permanently damaged by commencing anti-erosion measures. Explaining the deadline, chief engineer of the water resources department Sandeep Nadkarni said, “Currently beaches are getting eroded as per the natural process called beach depletion. Beaches lose sand during this period, which lasts till the end of August or first week of September. Following that the natural process of recovering happens and the beaches are restored. We are hoping that if by then the vessel is removed from the beach, the damage done to it won’t be permanent.”  Nadkarni added that the situation will become difficult once the sand starts accumulating back.  The department will be approaching the central water and power research station, Pune, once the vessel is removed from the beach. The institute will analyse the damage to the beach and will recommend the necessary plan to repair it.  As reported earlier by TOI, almost a quarter of the state’s coastline has been severely damaged by erosion and the WRD has pumped in almost Rs 16 crore to replenish it. The grounding of MV Lucky Seven, owned by former cabinet minister of Haryana Gopal Kanda has already affected the wave dissipation on the beach, experts said.  An approximate 100m stretch of the beach, south of the grounded vessel, towards Caranzalem side has started retreating with the impact of powerful wind-driven waves.
