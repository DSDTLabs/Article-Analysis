 Rumours about fake Rs 10 coins have again entered the market. Traders say that even nationalised banks refuse to accept the coins.
 
 The RBI had scotched up the rumour on November 20, saying, “Some less-informed or uninformed persons who suspect the genuineness of coins are creating doubts in the minds of ordinary people. It impeded the circulation of the coins in certain pockets of the country causing avoidable confusion.”
 
 Ajay Vyas, convener of state level bankers committee (SLBC), said, “No bank can deny depositing the coins”.
 
 Meanwhile, bank sources said, “Several banks are not accepting the coins because counting a large number of them is tedious.”
