THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/KOCHI: The private bus operators in the state began a 24-hour state-wide strike from Monday midnight by suspending bus operations. The token strike was declared by the operators as the discussion held with the transport minister A K Saseendran on Sunday failed to yield any results.

 The Kerala State Private Bus Operators Coordination Committee, in association with   that comprises around 12 bus operators, will participate in the strike.
 
 The minimum ticket charge should be increased to Rs 9 with the hike in diesel price and rationalisation of concession for students are some of the demands raised by the bus operators.
 
 “All the discussion held with the minister went futile, as he did not agree to any of the demands put forward by the private bus operators. In the name of nationalisation and   ( ), our route permits are not being renewed.
 
 Also, the tax on vehicles has been increased in last financial bill. These decisions of the government have affected our revenue. We have no other option to conduct a strike,“ said T Gopinathan, chairman of the bus operators' coordination committee.
 
 “The private bus operators will be forced to launch an indefinite strike, if our demands are not met,“ he added.
 
 “The bus fares were last revised in 2014. But the diesel prices have gone up from Rs 56 then to around Rs 63.40 now. A fully operational bus requires at least 80 litres of diesel every month,“ said Bus Operator's   convener   in Kochi.
 
 Raju added that bus operators are unable to make ends meet as the salaries of their employees have also increased in past two years.
