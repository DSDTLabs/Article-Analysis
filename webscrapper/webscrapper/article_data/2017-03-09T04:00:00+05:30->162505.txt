Vadodara: M S University’s famed Faculty of Fine Arts will pay tributes to the late legendary artist professor K G Subramanyan through a first memorial lecture. Subramanyan was fondly called ‘Mani da’ and ‘KG’ in the country’s arts fraternity. 

 The lecture will be delivered by Subramanyan’s one-time student and distinguished Delhi-based art critic, curator and writer Geeta Kapur on Thursday at C C Mehta auditorium. Kapur will deliver the lecture on ‘Ends and means: art and its ethical potential’. 
 
 The faculty has instituted the memorial lecture which will be held on annual basis in memory of Subramanyan, the celebrated Indian modern artist, teacher and writer, who had passed away on June 29 last year. After training under the legendary artists including Nandalal Bose, Binode Behari Mukherjee and Ramkinkar Baij in Santiniketan, Subramanyan had joined the fine arts faculty in Vadodara as a teacher. 
 
 He had served as a professor, head of painting department and later as dean of the faculty between 1950 and 1987 – during which he was instrumental in shaping the faculty.
