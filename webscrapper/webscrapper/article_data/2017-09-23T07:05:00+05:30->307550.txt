GREATER NOIDA: Rupendra, the last of the 18 people accused of   Mohammad   in Dadri’s Bisada village in September 2015 to be in jail, has got bail and was released from Luksar jail earlier this week.

 The 23-year-old was granted bail by the Allahabad high court on September 8 and was released on Thursday. Justice   granted him bail on a personal surety of Rs 50,000 each from two guarantors.
 
  Rupendra’s bail application was approved on the condition that he will neither tamper with the prosecution evidence nor delay the trial in any manner.
 
 Eighteen persons, including three juveniles, were arrested by police on charges of murdering Akhlaq and critically injuring his son Danish in their house in Bisada. The attack was triggered by a rumour that the 51-year-old handyman had consumed beef and also stored it in his refrigerator.
 
 The three minor   were released from juvenile homes, as were 13 others over a period of time after they managed to get bail. 
 
 One suspect, Ravi, died while in judicial custody after a prolonged illness in May 2017.
 
 Hariom, husband of Bisada village chief  , said it was good that all the villagers had got bail. 
 
 “The law is taking its course,” he said. 
 
 A fast track court in Surajpur is hearing the case. In the meantime, police have registered an FIR against Akhlaq and six of his family members for cow slaughter after a complaint from a Bisada villager.
