KOLKATA: Owners of some   that have come in the way of the   Metro have refused to accept shop spaces below the New Town box bridge offered by Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation. They want the civic body to give them   with land and building ownership.

 The corporation’s bid to resettle occupants of three two-storey  , at the beginning of New Town, comes in the wake of a notice pasted by the land acquisition department, under the North 24-Parganas DM on Friday. The occupants of the three buildings, along with those in another fourstorey and a five-storey structures, were told the state intended to reclaim the land, where their buildings were constructed after the New Garia-Airport Metro project was notified in 2011.
  
  On October 22, 2016, TOI reported the state had decided to raze the nine structures that came in the Metro path.
 
 The BMC is in charge of eviction and demolition of the buildings—a four-storey guesthouse (Megacity Inn) and a five-storey hotel (White Building) and three two-storey buildings that house seven shops and a canteen.
 
 A day after BMC officials measured the space for the shops, the owners changed their stance and sought twostorey houses with land rights. “The corporation should arrange for land equal to our plots’ size,” an owner, Sankar Mondal said. Another owner, Sukumar Mondal, said, “My shop on the ground floor and the room on the first floor measure 750 sqft. I want a land and a two-storey building with 750 sqft space,” he said.
 
 The occupants went to Mahishbathan councillor   to submit their demands but he refused to accept. “They must move court or submit their demand to the civic body,” he said.
 
 Civic chief Pritha Sarkar was not available for comment. Satrajit Roy, Megacity Inn owner, submitted his ownership documents to the commissioner.
