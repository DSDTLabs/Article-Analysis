If an insured commits suicide within three years, the claim is not payable. From which date would this period be reckonedthe date when the policy was taken, or the backdate from which risk was assumed? 

 Case Study: Jaswantâ€™s wife Babita had purchased a life   policy with a coverage of Rs1 lakh. The policy was taken on November 28, 1999, but was backdated to September 28, 1999the date of commencement of risk.
 
 Babita committed suicide on October 9, 2002. The date of suicide was more than three years after commencement of risk on September 28, 1999, but less than three years from the date when the policy was obtained.   lodged a claim under the policy. It was repudiated on the ground that no claim was payable if the life insured commits suicide before the expiry of three years from the date of the policy.
 
 Jaswant filed a complaint before the district forum. This interpretation was disputed by  . The forum upheld the complaint and directed the claim to be settled along with costs. 
 
 The   observed that insurance coverage was sought through a proposal form which was submitted on November, 1999, and the policy was issued on that date. Hence this would be the date from which the period of three years would have to be computed. Since his wife committed suicide on October 9, 2002, it was within the three years period.
 
 Accordingly, by its order of September 21 delivered by the Bench of Justice Ajit Bharihoke and Anup Thakur, the National   held that the repudiation of the claim was in accordance with the terms of the policy and was justified. The finding that there was no deficiency in service was confirmed and the revision was dismissed.
