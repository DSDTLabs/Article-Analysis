BENGALURU: Launched on Saturday,  ' door-to-door campaign evoked a lukewarm response in the BJP stronghold of Mahadevapura.
Despite a clarion call to workers to attend the mega rally -which saw the presence of AICC general secretary Karnataka in-charge K C Venugopal, chief minister Siddaramaiah and   president G Parameshwara -the event witnessed low attendance. Congress leaders like S T Somashekar had to make public announcements to ask workers not to leave the venue.
 
 This prompted Venugopal to issue a warning. "No one, including the CM and KPCC president, is exempted from the rally to be held over the next few months till the elections. I will visit Karnataka next month to take stock of the   programme with a review meeting," he said.
 
 Since Siddaramaiah was scheduled to leave for   for other engagements, the crowd thinned after his exit. Another exodus followed Venugopal's speech. In the end, 1,500-2,000 workers were present to listen to Parameshwara.
 
 Earlier, Siddaramaiah inaugurated the drive by visiting four or five houses to distribute a 32-page booklet to locals in Agaduru ward, Ramagondanahalli, before heading to the rally venue. Addressing a public meeting later, Siddaramaiah said, "Go to each and every house and tell them how the BJP (leaders) are inveterate liars.Tell them about the perils of falling for their lies and scheming ways."
 
 Law minister T B   was not allowed to visit Chiratahalli village in Sira constituency, Tumakuru district, for the programme.Enraged over the lack of civic facilities in the village, locals ghearoed him. As they refused to calm down, he was forced to leave.
