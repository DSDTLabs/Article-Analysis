 The project, which is being guided by an internationally renowned architect,  , and her team, will be presented at Archiprix International 2017, a biennial international competition for projects in architecture, organized at the Cept University on Thursday.
 
 One of the interesting features of the group’s installation is the map of Ahmedabad which has been created using denim patchwork. The others include roofing material, alternative umbrella to cover tables and counters in outdoor environments and façade shades among others.
 
 Talking about the project,   said, “The idea is to put waste fabric to a constructive use in the architecture so that there is a low impact on the environment in terms of waste and energy consumption. At the same time, we’ve engaged local community artisans from the Sewa to make it socio-economically beneficial.”
 
 “Currently, we’ve been procuring the denim waste fabric from a manufacturing company in Ahmedabad, which alone generates more than 1,300 kg denim waste fabric on a daily basis,” she said.
 
 Around six women artisans from the Sewa who specialize in art work such as mirror work, patchwork and embroidery have been roped in for the project. That apart, students from around 10 countries including India, Bangladesh, Latvia, Spain and   are part of the project.
