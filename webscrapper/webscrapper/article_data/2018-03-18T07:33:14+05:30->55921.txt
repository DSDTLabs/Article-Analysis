QUEPEM:   is a crime, and those indulging in it may chose a discreet place to do so. But in the heart of   town, this activity is being carried out with impunity in rented shops of a residential-cum-commercial building.

 This has prompted angry residents of Dasha Classic building, located opposite municipal market building, to file a complaint with Quepem police, alleging that two shops on the ground floor are running gambling activities without any fear of the police or locals.
 
 The occupants, led by Ciprianho D’Cunha, said that one shop is being used for a game room, and the other for playing cards.
 
 “By operating such illegal activities, residents are facing hardship the entire night due to noise pollution. They also fear for their own security owing to the presence of shady elements in the area,” said D’Cunha.
 
 Another resident,   told TOI that such activities can have an adverse influence on school going children and youth residing in the building, as they may be also lured into it.
 
 The building has around 20 flats and 15 shops. The residents have requested the police to take immediate action against the person involved in the illegal activities.
