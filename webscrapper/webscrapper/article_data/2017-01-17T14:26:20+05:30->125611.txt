Last year, Life Ok launched its Comedy show Bahu Hamari Rajni_Kant. The show revolved Shaan, a scientist who builds a humanoid robot named Rajni. The real fun begins when Shaan brings Rajni home and they get married.
 
  Rajni's adventures with the Kant family were really funny to watch and the show became popular instantly. Earlier in the show, actor   played the role of Shaan and after he left the show, he was replaced by Raqesh Vashisht Bapat.
  
  The change of actors didn't quite seem to revive the show and hence the makers have decided to wrap up the show as there is no point in unnecessarily stretching the story.
  
  
 
  
  The show premiered on the 15th of February in 2016 and will air its final episode on the 10th of February 2017. However, the makers may create a few more episodes so that the show can complete one full year of entertainment.
  
  Actress Vahbbiz Dorabjee has also confirmed the news as she uploaded a picture on her social media page where she says that the show is coming to an end.
