CHANDIGARH: The   cabinet has decided to shut down 1,647 “financially unviable” sewa kendras ( ) in the state and use the existing infrastructure of the centres as  .

 This follows recommendations by a committee headed by chief secretary that the state required only 500 such centres, which could be managed by the DCs.
 
 Of the 2,147 such centres, only 500 will remain operational. The cabinet decided to serve a 180-day notice, as required, to end the contract with the current service provider of the sewa kendras. The contract with the provider, who was charging the government Rs 220 crore annually, was for five years.
 
 During a discussion on the issue in the cabinet meeting, it was pointed out that the sewa kendras were constructed at a cost of Rs 200 crore, with Rs 1,400 crore estimated to be spent on their operations in five years. Health minister   described it as a criminal waste of public money and called for an inquiry into the matter.
 
 The cabinet took note of a proposal of the department of governance reforms, which suggested rationalization of the operations of the sewa kendras, as well as the report of the committee formed under the chief secretary to study the functioning of these kendras.
 
 To make the sewa kendra project financially viable, the cabinet decided on shifting their operations to a new model.
