Jalandhar:Punjab assembly elections have once again underlined the irrelevance of Left in the state. Communist parties that jointly contested the polls this year got under one lakh votes in the state — less than the votes polled for the ‘None of the Above’ (NOTA) option. 

 Even Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) could bag only 0.3% votes. 
 
 CPI, CPI (M), Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPOI) and CPI (Marxist-Liberation) had formed a common Left front and fielded candidates from 57 constituencies to avoid “division” of votes. However, put together, the four parties polled just 92,473 votes, while NOTA was pressed by 1,08,471 voters (0.7%). Even the Sucha Singh Chhotepur-led Aapna Punjab Party (AAP) polled more votes than any single Communist party, as it garnered 37,476 (0.2%) votes. 
 
 Not only Left, which has been pushed to the margins completely, Simranjeet Singh Mann-led SAD (Amritsar) is facing a similar fate. The party got just 49,260 votes (0.3%). 
 
 According to political observers, several Left activists had joined Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and many identifying with Sikh issues also went for AAP. “Even as AAP has lost and is now the main opposition party in Punjab, more Leftists can join the party in future. Left parties have reached a point in Punjab from where their revival in electoral politics appears impossible,” said a Communist activist.
 
 In the 2012 assembly elections, Left parties had formed a common front with Manpreet Singh Badal-led People’s Party of Punjab (PPP). This time, they made a common front among themselves and decided against joining hands with Congress, even as initially there were some talks between them.
