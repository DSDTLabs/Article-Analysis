Kamal Haasan, Sridevi's co-star in 27 films, could barely hold back tears as he mourned the loss of a fellow actor who shared his undying passion for the craft. The veteran actor recalled their association in a video recording that was released on Sunday morning. 

  "Mrs  's astounding talent was not luck. It was well-deserved and she worked for it from her childhood," he said. 
 
 " I am also a child actor and have known her from her teens. She was still a child then when she came to work with me and Mr Balachander, my mentor. Sometimes he gave me the responsibility of working with her and correcting her acting and shaping her, even her dance movements," he added. 
 
  "When she came, she was not as talented as she is (was), but she developed, every day she learned. I was astounded by her climb and every step of it, she worked for. She was very fond of me, and I very fond of her. Our paths diverged when she became a superstar in Hindi. She has acted in almost all languages in India and in about 27 films, with me. The moments we have had together were all in film shooting. We were working so continuously that our personal life was on the periphery. So, the kind of dedication she had truly matched mine, and so it's no wonder that we got on with each other. I think I saw her last month and we are not prone to showing emotion but somehow we both hugged each other and I am very grateful for that hug. The 'Sadma' song rings in my ears now."
