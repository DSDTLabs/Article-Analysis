LUDHIANA: A local court sentenced a drug peddler to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment on Wednesday. 

 The court of special judge Anjana also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on  , a resident of Lalton Kalan village, who was found guilty in a drug trafficking case. In case of default in fine payment, he will have to undergo another year of rigorous imprisonment.
 
 Jodhan police had arrested Singh on October 2, 2011, after 15 bags of poppy husk were recovered from his SUV. With each bag containing 34 kilograms of poppy husk, Singh, along with two of his associates, was going from   to   side. Even as Singh was nabbed, his two aides had given police the slip. 
 
 In its order, the special court said, “Convict Bhagwant Singh has been heard on the question of sentence and his statement in this regard has also been recorded wherein he has taken a plea that he is a poor person. His wife and minor children are totally dependent upon him. No other case under NDPS Act is pending against him. He has prayed for taking a lenient view. Additional public prosecutor for the state has requested for awarding deterrent punishment to the convict. Plea of convict on the question of sentence has been considered. However, in the State of Punjab Versus Baldev Singh, 1999 (3)   (Criminal) 533 (SC), it was held that drug abuse is social malady while drug addiction eats into the vitals of the society, drug trafficking not only eats into vitals of economy of country but illicit money generated by drug trafficking is often used for illicit activities including encouragement of terrorism”.
 
 The judgment read, “It has acquired the dimension of an epidemic, affects the economic policies of the state, corrupts the system and is detrimental to the future of country. Thus keeping in view all the facts and circumstances of this case, gravity of offence and taking a lenient view, convict Bhagwant Singh is sentenced to undergo imprisonment”.
