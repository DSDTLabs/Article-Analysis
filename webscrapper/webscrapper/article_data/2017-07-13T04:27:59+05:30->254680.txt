New Delhi: Desperate to find a maid for his elderly mother-in-law, 48-year-old Jitender   stumbled upon one “Sudhir Enterprises” on a web portal. The same evening, two company “executives” arrived at his   residence.

 They managed to convince Mahajan that his search for a maid had finally ended. The next day, two women – barely out of their teens – knocked at his door. They were accompanied by another company “executive”.
 
 “I agreed to hire one of them. We negotiated a monthly salary of Rs 4,000 for her and paid Rs 22,000 as commission,” Mahajan told TOI. 
 
 The two women produced “valid IDs” and the agent gave him a receipt for the payments. 
 
 Mahajan let out a room in his apartment for her. Later in the day, he sent the help out on an errand, never to see her again. He visited the address provided in the bill. Only, the house didn’t exist. The agency numbers were switched off too. Realising that he had been conned, Mahajan approached police.
 
 Monika Khurana, a resident of  , had a similar tale to tell. She paid an agency — again “Sudhir Enterprises” — Rs 29,000 as commission, only for the maid to vanish in two days. While police recently arrested two maids and an agent in connection with the two cases, Mahajan and Khurana were among the luckier victims. 
 
 A few years ago, Bimla Shah (80) was killed. She, like many others, had hired a help with the assistance of an illegal agency. In May this year, police arrested a couple from Odisha who duped people by offering services of a placement agency.
 
 Police say they have repeatedly urged people not to employ maids without verification. The southeast district police have, in fact, even launched an app called “Suraksha” to verify servants.
