Coimbatore: With same stores sales surging more than 30% year-on-year, Easybuy, the apparel value retail format from the Landmark Group, is aiming to hit the 100 stores mark and Rs 600 crore in revenues by 2020. Easybuy, which is opening a store every 15 days, would have 50 stores by the end of the year, a top official said.

 “Fashion is becoming more commoditised. Value buying is the fastest growing retail format now,” said Anand Aiyer, business head, Easybuy. “Fashion and retail brands are concentrated in the metros. Tier-2 and tier-3 markets, which are being dominated by regional brands now, have huge potential,” he said on the sidelines of the launch of the first Easybuy store here on Tuesday. “We are looking at fast expansion. Our aim is to have a presence in all the district headquarters in the country,” Anand stated. Easybuy, which opened its first store in September 2014, has expanded to 20 stores now. After opening stores in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, it is all set to spread its footprint to Kerala. All Easybuy stores are ‘franchisee owned and run’ stores with typical stores spread over 5,000-7,000 sq. ft. of space offering menswear, ladies wear, kids wear, footwear and accessories. The stores, with a turnover of Rs 131 crore, achieved break-even in the first year of operations itself, Anand claimed. Easybuy offers its products in the price range of Rs 69-699 that are also available in select ‘Spar Hypermarkets’ across the country.
 
 The Indian apparel market is estimated to be around Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Out of this, the organised market is pegged at Rs 80,000 crore. Brands are present mostly in the premium segment which has a market size of about Rs 25,000 crore, he said. But they do not have any significant share in the middle and economy segment that has a market size of around Rs 1.6 lakh crore, he stated. The middle and economy segment is being dominated by regional brands and multi-brand outlets, Anand said.
