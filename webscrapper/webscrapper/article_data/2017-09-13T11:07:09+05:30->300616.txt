RAMPUR: Police on Tuesday sent the audio and video recordings of   leader Azam Khan to a forensic lab for further investigations about his alleged remarks against Indian servicemen.
 
  In June this year, police had registered an FIR against the former UP minister after he made a derogatory comment against the Indian Army. Speaking at an event in Rampur, Khan had allegedly said, "Soldiers have been beaten up by women in Kashmir, Jharkhand and Assam and their private parts chopped off. The truth is that women are forced to act against the Army. It is a message that India should be ashamed of.”
  
  Soon after delivering the speech at his party office here, an FIR was filed against Khan for promoting enmity by allegedly suggesting soldiers had been sexually harassing women in different parts of the country.
  
  The FIR was filed under sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups) and section 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) of the   at Civil Lines police station following a compliant by   leader Akash Kumar Saxena, son of senior BJP leader and former cabinet minister Shiv Bahadur Saxena.
  
  Investigating officer and SHO of Civil Lines station Braj Kishor Mishra had started collecting video clips of Khan’s speech, which had been widely shared on social media.
  
  “The collected evidence, which includes audio and video CD of Khan’s speech, has been sent to the forensic laboratory at Moradabad. Now for further investigation his voice sample is also required. We are waiting for further directions from the higher authorities,” Mishra told TOI.
  
  The complainant, Akash, had met senior police officials and demanded speedy investigation into the matter.
  
  “Khan’s statement has hurt the morale of the Army and thus affected the integrity of our nation. His statement is an act of sedition, for which he must receive the strictest punishment,” Akash said.
