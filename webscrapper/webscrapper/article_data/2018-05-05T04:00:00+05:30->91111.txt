Surat: Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta has cancelled approval of appointment of a teacher in C N Kothari Homoeopathy Medical College and Research Centre in Vyara following a report of a three-member inquiry committee. A reader in the college Ghanshyam Rawal was suspended two days after a meeting of the syndicate that did not allow the VC to affiliate several colleges to the university. Rawal is member of the syndicate.  “The three-member committee of Tarun Tejwani, Alpesh Shah and Vipul Shastri inquired into a complaint against Rawal and it found that he did not have requisite qualification to be appointed reader. Based on the findings, his approval as teacher has been cancelled by the university. Hence, he loses his membership in all other bodies,” senate member Gaurang Vaidya said. “This decision against me is biased since I had objected to the VC’s attempt to give approval to the proposal for affiliation to some colleges. I was not even heard by the committee and without my reply, it took this decision,” Rawal said.  Besides Rawal, seven other syndicate members had objected to the VC’s decision to give affiliation to some colleges which were inspected by local inquiry committees (LIC) appointed by him without taking the university syndicate into confidence. “The syndicate meeting has been called again next week before which attempts are being made to reduce the number of syndicate members to minimize the chances of objection to the proposal of affiliation,” a syndicate member said.
