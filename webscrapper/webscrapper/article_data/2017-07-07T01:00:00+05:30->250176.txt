He’s one of the only tenors (a voice type between a bass and a baritone — the highest of the ordinary adult male range) in Mumbai. But it hasn’t been an easy journey for opera   Amar Muchhala to achieve what he has today. As a child, he used to stammer, and because of the constant bullying, he would open his mouth only to sing! Luckily for him, his   training helped him with the stammer and today, he has performed across the world and has mastered 'Komm, O Holde Dame', one of the most difficult   arias. He is also said to be the first Indian in the history of the chamber opera to perform.

 Though this Mumbai lad studied business management and French literature in the USA, he went ahead to pursue an operatic career after finishing his training at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Unlike regular singing, Amar explains why opera singing is tougher. “The genre demands years of training to allow for the seamless, naturally amplified vocal production for a pure acoustic experience. After all, there are no microphones or any other form of electronic amplification when I perform.” 
 
 Amar has toured across the world and will soon be performing in the city along with the SOI Chamber. He will deliver some of the most exquisite, little-known pieces from the Lyric Tenor repertory. “The emphasis will be on the quality of music making and the expressiveness of the operatic tenor voice,” he shares.
