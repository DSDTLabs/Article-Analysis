AHMEDABAD:   on Monday told the authorities that   is a big problem and they should bring about a   by involving   in the process. 

 AMC has been claiming that it initiated harsh action against those who let their cattle to stray on to public roads and the intensity of its action has increased since August 10, when the HC took AMC to task.
 
 The judges commented that in absence of grazing land in the ever-widening city, the cattle nuisance is bound to increase. The HC also criticized the removal of green cover in the city and said that chopping down trees leaves birds and monkeys homeless. The HC also said temporary application of criminal laws will not bring about any solution.
 
 In his affidavit, city municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar repeated the AMC's assertions from the last hearing.
 
 The HC suggested that the AMC and police rope in the cattle owners to deal with the cattle menace on city roads. It said that representatives of cattle-owning communities should be included in the committee formed to deal with the issue. The Maldhari Samaj welcomed this suggestion. However, on HC orders, one such committee was formed more than a decade ago to resolve the problem.
 
 To solve the cattle problem, the city commissioner said that AMC has proposed that the government enact the Gujarat Keeping and Restricting Movement of Cattle in Urban Areas Control Act, 2017. The state government submitted that after getting responses from all concerned departments, the proposal for legislation will be placed before the cabinet.
 
 The HC asked AMC to file further compliance reports on its direction to remove cattle nuisance from city roads by October 4.
