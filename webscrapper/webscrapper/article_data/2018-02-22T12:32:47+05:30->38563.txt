MYSURU: In a clear indication of its intent on encroachments along the procession route for the   of the Sri   in  , public works department (PWD) on Wednesday demolished a portion of a convention centre on Bazaar Street. The demolition was part of the drive the PWD has undertaken to ensure that there are no hurdles to the movement of the chariot during the ‘Dodda Jathre’ of the temple scheduled to start on March 28. 

 The district administration started the drive after local organisations and residents protested the   of roads through which the chariot would pass during the procession. The Nanjangud Samagra Rathabeedhi Abhivruddhi Horata Samithi had, in fact, erected a notice board calling attention to the problem.
 
 Besides removing the encroachments along the route, the outfit also demanded that the condition of the roads be improved. Following a series of protests, the district administration directed PWD to concretise the roads.
 
 Deputy commissioner D Randeep instructed officials concerned to ensure that the encroachments were removed, and the condition of the roads improved in time for the fair. Following his directives, the PWD initiated work on concretisation of the route from Angadi Beedhi and Paatashala Beedhi to RP Road.
 
 Sources in PWD said that the owners of the convention centre that was partially razed on Wednesday had been approached, and advised to remove some of the valuable wooden structures before they initiated the demolition.
 
 “The owner agreed, and we decided not to go ahead with the drive for a few days till he removed these valuable structures. But the owner brought a stay on the demolition. When the court vacated the stay, we decided to go ahead with the demolition,” a source said.
 
 Meanwhile, secretary of the Jana Sangram Parishat Nagarale Vijay Kumar called for demolition of all structures that had encroached roads along the procession route, and others that encroached on government property.
