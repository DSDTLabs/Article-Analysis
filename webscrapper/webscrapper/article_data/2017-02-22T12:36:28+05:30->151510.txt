PONDA: Goa government might have scrapped the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) policy eight years ago, but construction material abandoned at a proposed pharmaceutical company site might still be attracting illegal takers.   police have seized a truck and an excavator from the disputed SEZ site at   on Tuesday afternoon. Though the truck was empty, police are verifying the reason of the vehicles being present on site.

 Ponda police said they received a tip-off and swung into action, but as the source hadn’t come forward to lodge a complaint, they couldn’t register any case against the drivers or the owner of the vehicles.
 
 “We could only detain the drivers on suspicion under Section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Code and will produce them before the sub-divisional magistrate,” a police officer said. The 12.32 lakh sq m land, allotted by   to  , has been lying abandoned since June 15, 2009, when the government withdrew the SEZ policy.
