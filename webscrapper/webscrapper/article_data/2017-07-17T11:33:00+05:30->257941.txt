ET Intelligence Group: Hindustan Unilever’s ( ) first quarter results, to be announced on Tuesday, will be one of the most awaited by those who are closely tracking the fast-moving consumer goods industry to gauge the disruptive impact of the new tax regime on the industry bellwether. One of the earliest   to post its first quarter results, HUL’s performance will reveal how much of its primary sales were impacted due to GST. The destocking by the trade in the weeks before the   rollout is likely to hamper the growth numbers. While the company’s revenue may grow 1-2 per cent, thanks to price increases, volumes may either remain flat or see a low single-digit decline.
 
  Companies such as HUL that have a strong network with various trade channels are likely to face lower impact of destocking than its smaller peers. Price increases taken during the quarter and a lower ad spend budget could enable the company to maintain its operating profitability at 19-20 per cent.
  
  
  
  
  The Street expects HUL to outperform. Evidently, the stock has gained 13 per cent since reporting its fourth quarter results in May earlier. Investors would be keen to know the management’s commentary on the impact of GST on the current quarter sales, pace of restocking at the trade level, its focus on natural products, outlook on demand, especially in rural areas, and expected trend on advertising spend.
  
  The HUL stock is trading at a forward FY18 earnings multiple of 47 with limited scope for a major upside. However, high valuations have historically not deterred the Street from lapping up the best performing  . Data from Bloomberg shows that 52 per cent of the analysts tracking the HUL stock are bullish on it ahead of the first quarter results.
