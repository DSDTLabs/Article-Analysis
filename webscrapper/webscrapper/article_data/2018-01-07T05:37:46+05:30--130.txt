AMMAN: Jordan said on Saturday that the   will push for international recognition of east   as the Palestinian capital, after President   last month recognised the contested city as Israel’s capital.

 Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi made the announcement at a joint news conference with Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit after talks to decide on a joint Arab response to Trump. The meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and the Palestinian authority as well as by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) minister of state for foreign affairs.
 
 “There is a political decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and we will strive to reach an international political decision to recognise a Palestinian state... with (east) Jerusalem as its capital,” Safadi said.
 
 In 2012, the UN General Assembly recognised a state of Palestine in lands Israel captured in 1967, including east Jerusalem, as an observer state, but many Western countries stopped short of bilateral recognition. Under a broad international consensus, the fate of Jerusalem is to be determined in negotiations.
