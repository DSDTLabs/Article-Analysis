Siddharth Kumar Tewary's popular show 'Mahakali' recently witnessed the re-entry of actor   who plays the character of Mahisashur. This is the second time Nirbhay is taking an entry in the show. Speaking on that Nirbhay says,"I have played the character of   last year in 'Mahakali' just after I wrapped up  . I have played the character for sometime and now again am back in the show. The track is of Dussera in which the Mahisashur is blessed so no man or animal can kill him. Only a powerful woman can kill him. So there will be Maa Kaali this time who will come in the front and deal with Mahisashur." 

 Interestingly Kaali's role is being played by Pooja Sharma who was Draupadi in   Production's 'Mahabharat' where Nirbhay used to portray Dushasan! Nirbhay adds,"Pooja and I are great friends. It is always a pleasure to share screen with her. Recently we have been to Thailand together and shot for a music album there." Nirbhay also played the character of Hanuman in the recently concluded 'Karmaphal Data Shani'. Speaking about his association with Siddharth and   says,"I came to Mumbai for better opportunities. During that phase the   auditions were going on.   from Swastik was the person who got me introduced to Siddharth Kumar Tewary and Rahul Kumar Tewary. I was so raw that even my auditions happened with a help of a prompter. Today when I look back I feel indebted to Swastik Productions because Mahabharat was my debut show and only after that did I get a lot of work. People have given me loads of love for my portrayal of Lord Hanuman in 'Sankatmochan Mahabali Hanuman."
