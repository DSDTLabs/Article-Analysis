 CR's divisional railway manager   said, "We are going to deploy drone cameras to survey the ghat section."
 
 CR will invite tenders to hire the technology which is expected to cost between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 per km. This is the first time that drones will be used for pre-monsoon work on the railways in Mumbai. An official said that drone cameras will also be used for inspection of pre-monsoon work. "We will have to seek permission from the police department for use of this technology in the CSMT-Kalyan section."
 
 CR, whose network is more prone to water-logging, has already begun pre-monsoon preparation work. It has identified 67 spots which are prone to water-logging. 
 
 The  , along with CR officials, carried out a joint inspection of these sites last week.
 
 Jain said, "We have requested the BMC for use of a pump with capacity to flush out 1,000 cubic meters of water from the tracks each hour at two locations, including Kurla, so that train operation do not get affected due to water-logging."
