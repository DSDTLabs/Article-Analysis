The alumnae association of a private girls’ college in the city organised their much-awaited dance fest  , recently, which was attended by youngsters from other colleges too. Since stag entry wasn’t allowed, we spotted several boys looking for a partner outside the venue for a last minute entry. 
DJ Divesh’s electrifying music was a major attraction at the fiesta.   belted out songs like Shape Of You, Swag Se, Kaala Chashma, etc which had the crowd dancing non-stop. Among the first one to reach the dance floor was Arunima Roy. 
 Having a tough time judging these youngsters for suitable titles were alumni   and Dr  . Finally, after a lot of brainstorming, the title of Prince was awarded to   while   was crowned the Princess.
