Vadodara: A new controversy has surfaced at M S University over appointment of dean of Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) and principal of Polytechnic College. 

 It was on Monday last that based on standing committee’s recommendations, MSU’s syndicate members had approved appointment of professor Arun Pratap as dean of FTE and Virendra Kher as principal of Polytechnic College.
 
 Senate member Kapil Joshi on Saturday, however, alleged that the two appointments have been done in violation of both the guidelines of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) – the apex regulatory body for technical education in the country and MSU Act. 
 
 Joshi claimed that as per AICTE norms only those having background of engineering field can be appointed as dean or principals in engineering faculties or colleges in the country. 
 
 Joshi, who has taken up the issue with MSU chancellor Shubhangini Raje Gaekwad and AICTE top brass, said that since 1949, not a single person not having an engineering background has been appointed as dean of FTE. 
 
 Pratap, he says, is a professor of physics and hence has a non-engineering background. Similarly, Kher too has a non-engineering background. 
 
 “When both AICTE norms and MSU Act very clear state that only those with engineering background can be appointed on the posts, why are MSU officials misguiding the university’s syndicate body?” he said. 
 
 The senate member also claimed that senior professors from IITs had applied for the post at FTE. “But qualifications and merits were not taken into consideration,” he said.
