 Neither her hearing impairment nor her troubled family background could stop I   from emerging the topper in   for the Deaf. Expressing a keen interest to draw, Taseen, who secured 83%, has set her sights on being an architect.
 
 Having never seen her father, who left home when before she was born, for Taseen it is her mother, K   who is her world. “I am still unsure of when she had lost her hearing. As a child, she used to smile, but never respond when I called her, and I assumed it was normal. It was when she attended kindergarten in a regular school that I learned she had a hearing impairment. The teachers of the school were supportive and they encouraged her to perform well,” says Tabassum, who adds that Taseen was a class topper all through. “She is a brilliant student and I think it is the desire to support her mother that motivates her to work harder. There are times that she feels upset when she doesn’t do as well as she wants, but through periodic counselling, we are helping her to overcome her fear of failure,” says her science teacher J E Usha.
