MUMBAI: Even though manufacturing is a major focus of the Make in India campaign, the growth rate of this sector is set to decline in 2017-18 in the country’s most industrialized state.

 Maharashtra’s economic survey for 2017-18 projects a slowing of industrial growth from 6.9% in 2016-17 to 6.5% in 2017-18. The decline in manufacturing is set to be sharper—from 8.3% to 7.6%. Economists say this could be a reflection of the impact of demonetization and GST. It is also a reflection of agriculture being hit, which affects the economy as a whole because of a drop in rural demand.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The only sector within industry projected to post significant growth is utilities—electricity, gas and water supply. The growth rate for this sector was -2.8% in 2016-17 and is now expected to reach 7.6%.
 
 Also on the positive side, the survey shows a 45% rate of conversion of project approvals, which is higher than most states. From August 1991 to December 2017, almost 20,000 industrial proposals with an investment of Rs 11.9 lakh crore were received; 45% were commissioned with an investment of almost Rs 3 lakh crore (25%).
 
 The IT sector continues to attract the maximum investment in the state, accounting for 33% of total investments, followed by the fuel industry, which accounts for 12% and metallurgy (8.6%). These three accounted for almost 54% of the investment in the state, the survey says.
 
 Of the Rs 8 lakh crore worth of investments during the Make in India Week in 2016, as much as 61% are in various stages of implementation, the survey said.
 
 Nationally,   has the highest share of approved industrial proposals, accounting for a share of 17.9% from August 1991 to December 2017.   in comparison has 12.5%. Also, investment generated by the proposals was higher in Gujarat, which had a share of 12.9% compared to Maharashtra’s 10%. The state received 246 proposals for   (SEZs) up to October 2017, of which only 28 were executed.
 
 In terms of FDI inflows, the latest data shows Maharashtra’s share in the country to be 32%: The RBI in Mumbai received Rs 74,123 crore worth of equity inflows for Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu during April to December 2017, the economic survey says.
 
 Exports from Maharashtra seem set for a decline. In 2016-17, the state’s exports were worth Rs 4.5 lakh crore. But by November 2017, the value of exports was only Rs 1.8 lakh crore. The survey quotes old data from the Annual Survey of Industries (2014-15), which shows that Maharashtra has the premier position in terms of gross value added to this sector, accounting for 20.5%.
