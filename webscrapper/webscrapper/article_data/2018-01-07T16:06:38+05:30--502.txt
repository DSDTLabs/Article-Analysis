 Britney Spears's former mansion in  , California, which was purchased for USD 8.1 million last year, was one of the most expensive houses to be sold in the area.

 The master suite boasts a boutique-inspired dressing room, and a dry sauna for a total of six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. 
 
 Spears never owned the property and had instead leased it from producer  , who purchased the estate in 2013 for about USD 5.4 million.
