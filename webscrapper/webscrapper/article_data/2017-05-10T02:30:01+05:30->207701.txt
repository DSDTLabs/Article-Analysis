MUMBAI: Two days before the SC begins hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the validity of triple talaq, halala marriages and polygamy, senior cleric Maulana Syed Shahabuddin Salafi Firdausi has denounced   and halala, calling them un-Islamic and instruments to oppress women.

 At a press conference on Tuesday activists of Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy (IMSD) hailed Maulana Firdausi’s statements as a support to the petitioners who are asking for scrapping of   and halala.
 
 IMSD’s convenor Javed Anand read out Maulana Firdausi’s statement: “Instant divorce by uttering talaq thrice is a mockery of Islam and an act of cruelty against the daughters of Islam. Halala is like dacoity on the dignity of Muslim women and an assault on their honour and self-esteem.”
 
 When asked why he kept quiet on these issues for so long, Maulana Firdausi told TOI: “I have been speaking to leading  . Many of them privately agree that triple talaq and halala should be banned but are afraid to say so publicly for fear of losing funds.”
 
 Islamic scholar-activist Qutub Jahan Kidwai, said, “The   wants to appear as a champion of Muslim women’s rights. Muslims activists have fought for reforms for over four decades and political parties should not communalise an essentially gender issue.” She added that triple talaq and halala are just part of customs being perpetuated by a patriarchal society.
