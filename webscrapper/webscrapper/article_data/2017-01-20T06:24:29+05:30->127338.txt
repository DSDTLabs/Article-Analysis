NEW DELHI: The   has written to the cabinet secretariat a second time on the opposition's plea seeking postponement of the   in view of the forthcoming state polls, asking for details of the procedure followed in the budget being delayed due to the same set of   in 2012. 

  The EC letter, dispatched on Wednesday, seeks information on the processes involved in preparation and presentation of the budget. It has asked the government to file its reply latest by 10am on Friday. 
 
  The budgetary exercise is in its last leg and Parliament is to meet on January 31 with the finance minister due to read out his speech on February 1. The government does not anticipate any serious hurdles other than clarification that budget announcements should not be focussed on states that are going to polls. 
 
 When the opposition had objected to Budget presentation in 2012 in view of assembly polls in UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa, the then UPA government had accepted the argument and put off the exercise from February 28 to March 16.
 
 The Modi government has stated that bringing forward the budget is specifically intended to ensure the fiscal cycle of allocations and spending begins well before the monsoon session. 
 
 The government has said all budgetary provisions will be allocated to different sectors from April 1, the beginning of the new fiscal. 
 
 The Centre argued that presentation of the budget at the end of February made approval of the Budget spill over to the next  , delaying the start of new programmes.
 
  On January 10, the government had replied to the EC on the opposition complaint against presenting the Budget before assembly elections, defending its decision to advance the budget session.
