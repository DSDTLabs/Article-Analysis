BENGALURU: Upset over not being able to trace his missing son, a police sub-inspector attached to the City Armed Reserve (south) allegedly committed suicide in Adugodi on Saturday night. Dayananda  , 58, resident of Jayanagar, was found hanging in the office godown. 

 In his suicide note, Sagar had stated that he could not bear the pain of his son’s disappearance. “Nobody is responsible for my death. My younger son Ganesh left home four months ago and never returned. I’m not able to bear this pain and decided to commit suicide. Excuse me,” he wrote. 
 
  The incident came to light when his elder son Kiran came to CAR at 11pm after Sagar failed to reach home in the evening. Sagar was deployed for bundobust at JD( S) leader H D Deve Gowda’s residence on Saturday. After duty, he went to CAR by evening, but didn’t return to his Jayanagar residence. Kiran tried to contact him over phone, but in vain. A worried Kiran rushed to CAR ground and found his father’s bike near the godown. Later, he found his father hanging. 
 
  Ganesh was running a tea stall in Jayanagar. As he was not serious about the business, Sagar had given him an earful in February. 
 
 After that, Ganesh left home and never returned. There has been no headway in the case despite a missing complaint being filed.
