PANAJI: Former RSS Goa chief  , whose RSS breakaway faction had formed the   (GSM) and aligned with the MGP for the 2017 polls against the BJP, said that he did not expect MGP’s Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar to do the “unprincipled” act of backing the   government.

 “We did not expect Sudin to form the government with BJP. We had rejected the BJP government and specifically formed an alliance against it, with an objective to defeat the BJP. This is disrespect of the democractic systems. As   has bagged the maximum of 17 seats, ideally, one should wait for them to stake claim to form the government,” Velingkar said, speaking to TOI on Sunday night. 
 
 Velingkar said that Goa will have to wait for “formalities” to be completed to say that “BJP has formed the government”.
 
 Velingkar’s GSM had made it clear from the start that the party was contesting the 2017 polls to defeat the BJP government. GSM’s ire was mainly directed at Union defence minister Manohar Parrikar, who is all set to return as chief minister of Goa. “Looks like we will have to wait for a party with principles to get elected,” Velingkar said. tnn
