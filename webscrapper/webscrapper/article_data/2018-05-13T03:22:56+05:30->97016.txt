THANE: While the announcement of examination results often spark a feeling of unrest or stress amongst students and teachers, the atmosphere in the   schools as well as the homes of their students continues to be  , just days before their results.

 From vacationing with their family and friends to continuing their preparation for their further studies, many class X and XII students from city-based ICSE and   schools will be continuing their pre-planned schedule this week even though their results will be declared tomorrow.
 
 “I have been consistently doing well in each of my subjects throughout the year and I am   that I will do well. I was a bit anxious about the no moderation in the paper correction process, but our teachers have assured us that it is nothing to be worried about. My parents had organised a trip to Bhutan from this Saturday much before the dates were announced. So I guess I will be celebrating my results, whatever it is in the hills,” said Sneha Shetty, a class X, ICSE student.
 
 Meanwhile, 17-year-old Rohan Jaisinghani an ISC student from Kopri, added, “I have given my best in the exam and worrying about it is not going to help my score get better. I have begun preparing for various entrance exams and am focused on that. The results will, hopefully, motivate me further.”
 
 Academicians here believe that it is the entire syllabus, which focuses on the students holistic development right from the beginning, coupled with the child friendly and clear access to the results via the board website has helped these youngsters set these realistic expectations and reduced their anxiety levels.
 
 “The main reasons for stress amongst students and their parents are the uncertainty and confusion about the dates and process of viewing the results and uncertainty of their scores,” said Asha Narayanan, principal of Lodha World School.
