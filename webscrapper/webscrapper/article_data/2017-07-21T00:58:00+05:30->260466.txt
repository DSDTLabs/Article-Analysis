SHIMLA: Under pressure from general public seeking justice for the minor who was gang raped and murdered in Kothkai, chief minister   on Wednesday said the guilty would be punished. But governor   has taken a serious note of the crime and sought a report from the state government about the progress of the investigation within two days, according to  , advisor to the governor. 

 While addressing a public meeting at Padhar in Mandi district, Virbhadra said the state government had earlier formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and later, he personally wrote to Prime Minister   to conduct a CBI inquiry in this case. “It is after the end of the trial that punishment is decided by the courts,” he added.
 
 Continuing with his attack on BJP for politicising the issue, the CM said that playing politics on the death of a minor girl was shameful. "I am sincerely committed to bringing the guilty to book and want them to be hanged for the heinous crime they have committed," he said.
 
 He also asked the media to restrain from exaggerating this issue keeping in view the sensitivity of the case which was one of the rarest. He said that law and enforcement agencies are on the job and very soon, the truth would be unravelled.
 
 Meanwhile, in a letter written to chief secretary V C Pharka on Wednesday, the governor has described the incident as very sensitive. In his letter, he mentioned that steps should be taken to restore the faith of the people in the government. He added that the death of a person related to the incident in police custody had added to the sensitivity of the case.
