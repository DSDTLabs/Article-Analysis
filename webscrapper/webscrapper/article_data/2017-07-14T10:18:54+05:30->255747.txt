We had told you that Chennai filmmaker Santhosh is making a film on the   jallikattu protests, titled   5-23 January 2017. Now, the film's team had been to   to shoot the cattle of the   tribe, as it has links to the   bull that is used for jallikattu.

 Speaking about this, Nirupama Santhosh, the film's producer, says, “The cattle in East   (presentday Kenya) that the Maasai Mara tribes breed is the closest relation to our Kangayam kaalai, which we use for jallikattu. In the ancient days, when mankind moved from one civilisation and formed new civilisations, they also took their cattle along with them.Bernard R Agwanda, head of mammology section and research scientist at the National Museum Of Kenya informed us the research done on cattle and civilisa tions show that this cattle had travelled along to south India. There is a direct match on the DNA of the East African cattle and our Kangayam bull.“
 
 The filmmakers say that they wanted to shoot this cattle for their film to show that domestication of cattle has been a phenomenon since the ancient days. “Today , there are voices saying that domestication of cattle is not acceptable and is against nature. But the Maasai tribes actually raise their cattle in the middle of their settlement, with the houses acting as an enclosure. We want to show the harmonious rela tionship between and man and cattle,“ explains Nirupama.
