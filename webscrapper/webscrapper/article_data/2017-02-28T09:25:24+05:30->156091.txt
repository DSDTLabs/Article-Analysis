PUNE: The   on Sunday arrested a 33-year-old man for sexually assaulting   — his daughter, a step-daughter and the daughter of his sister-in-law. All the assaults took place over the past one year.

 However, the man’s wife lodged a complaint against him on Sunday after she came to know that he had sexually assaulted her sister’s nine-year-old daughter too.
 
 “We have arrested him under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,” senior inspector   of Sangvi police station said.
 
 Police said that the suspect works with an agent at the Pune regional transport office. The complainant is his second wife. The suspect has a 12-year-old daughter from his first marriage, while the woman has a 10-year-old daughter from her earlier marriage. 
 
 “After being separated from her first husband, the woman married the suspect in 2010. He also happens to be her distant relative,” an officer from the Sangvi police station said.
 
 The officer said the man had been sexually assaulting his daughter from the first marriage and also the 10-year-old step daughter for the past one year. “The woman was in the know about the attacks as the two minor girls had told her about them. But she had not approached the police as her husband had apologised for his acts and had urged her not to lodge a complaint against him. Also, the assaults had stopped then,” the officer said. 
 
 However when she came to know on Sunday that he had sexually assaulted her sister’s minor daughter too, she immediately rushed to the police station and lodged a complaint. 
 
 The suspect was produced before a court on Monday and remanded to police custody for three days, police said.
