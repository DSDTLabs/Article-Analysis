Panaji: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had earlier announced that the new Zuari bridge will be ready ahead of schedule in January 2019. But, it now appears, the bridge will not meet this deadline and, in fact, its construction will be behind schedule. As per the contract awarded to Bhopal-based firm Dilip Buildcon Ltd, the work on the new bridge has to be completed by May 2019. But, on Tuesday, minister for state of road transport and highways, Mansukh L Mandaviya, submitted in the Rajya Sabha that the new Zuari bridge will only be ready by November 2019. In reply to a question, it was submitted that one per cent of the bridge work has been completed. Mandaviya also stated in the reply that the new Mandovi bridge will be ready by May 2018 and that 60% of the over Rs 500 crore bridge has been completed. The bridge will be completed as per its extended deadline. The much-awaited bridges over Galgibaga and Talpona rivers, which are part of the Canacona bypass, are also expected to be delayed beyond expectations. Mandaviya said only 36% of the work on the bridges is completed. The Canacona bypass from Char Rasta to Mashem is expected to reduce travel time for Canacona locals by at least 15km. Those living along the Galgibaga and Talpona rivers are worst affected as they use motorboats to go across and have no means to access the mainland in case of emergencies at night.
