LUCKNOW: The family members of deceased   officer   say that the trouble between his and senior Karnataka officers started building up in September last year when he had gone to attend a Vipassana course in Pune. 

 “As attendees are asked to give up normal life and meditate for up to 14 hours, Anurag had switched off his mobile phone. Therefore, a number of called made by the chief secretary — who had just taken charge and probably was not aware about his course — went unanswered. This led to a big communication gap between the two,” says PN Shukla, who is next-door neighbour of the Tewari family in Bahraich and accompanied Anurag’s brother, mother and sister-in-law during their Lucknow trip.
 
 “It appears that Anurag told his immediate boss about his plan to visit Vipassana centre. At that time some officers were transferred and new chief secretary was appointed. As the new CS SC Khuntia — appointed on September 28 last year — did not know about his plan, he tried to contact him over phone repeatedly but it remained unreachable,” he told TOI.
 
 Soon after taking over as commissioner of food civil supplies, Anurag stopped payment of Rs 40 crore which had been approved, Shukla further says, adding “he came across anomalies and did not sign the files despite a lot of pressure.” Before reaching Lucknow on May 14, Anurag had spent three to four days in Bahraich and caught up with Shukla. 
 
 Appointed as commissioner of food civil supplies in December last year, Anurag remained away from Karnataka soon after detecting the anomalies and raising it before seniors, said Mayank, his brother who arrived in the city with mother Sushila and wife Sunita apart from Shukla.
