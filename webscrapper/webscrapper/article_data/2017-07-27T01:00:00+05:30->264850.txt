Following the success of the inaugural season of her chat show 'No   Neha', actress   is excited to be back with its second season. She says, “The most important factors on a talk show are the guests and the format. And of course, everything is incomplete without an audience. In all modesty, I would like to say that it’s the love of the guests and the listeners that has got us into season two.”

 Ask her how different this season will be and Neha replies, “Last season, we got some amazing guests like  , Ranbir Kapoor, Anurag Kashyap, Farah Khan,   Khan, Sonam Kapoor,  , Arjun Kapoor, Chetan Bhagat and Yuvraj Singh. We have got a great mix this season as well. So far, I have recorded with  , Varun Dhawan, Parineeti Chopra, Vidya Balan, Sania Mirza and Imtiaz Ali. And there are other names I am not revealing yet.”
 
 It’s not just the glamour or the fame element. The actress says that she is building her show as a space where people can speak their mind. She elaborates, “My show is a space where anyone who wants to speak their mind is welcome. Anyone who has a voice and a message along with a sense of humour is welcome to sit on that chair across me.”
 
 Produced by Big Girl Productions and an online music streaming platform, the show releases on July 27 at midnight.
