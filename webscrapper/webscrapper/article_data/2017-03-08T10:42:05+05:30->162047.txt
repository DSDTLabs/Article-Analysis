HYDERABAD: While the entire country would be celebrating   on Wednesday, police stationed at 122 airports in India would be   who have a look-out circular ( ) pending against them for deserting their wives.

 The city police said these circulars were issued after women complained of their husbands abandoning them. Police said that 30 such circulars have been issued against NRIs hailing from the city who have abandoned their wives over the past two months.Even police officials said that they were surprised at the number of circulars they have issued this year. “Hardly three months into the year, we have already issued 30 such notices. This only shows how women are being victimised under the guise of marriage,“ said A  , ACP , She Teams.
  
 On the flipside, while the number of such circulars do come across as daunting, she was all praise for the women of the city, who are pushing for such a circular against their spouses.These circulars are issued against men who do not return to India for a long time after they get married. Earlier when women approach the police, they used to register just a missing case, but now with the new circular, their husbands are being detained at airports as soon as they come into the country .
 
 “We get these cases when wives are abandoned by hus bands. Only a few have been caught so far, but it is heartening to know that women are opting to file these LOCs against their husbands,“ said D Kavitha, ACP, She Teams.
 
 She further added that of the 30 cases filed so far, most of the husbands are living in West Asian countries, while the rest are in places like Australia, the United States of America, United Kingdom and Canada.“In most of these cases, the husband leaves his wife after she is unable to pay him additional dowry. Since these notices are given to the airports, he is taken into custody there itself, and then handed over to us,“ she said. The accused is then taken to the local court and placed in judicial remand.
