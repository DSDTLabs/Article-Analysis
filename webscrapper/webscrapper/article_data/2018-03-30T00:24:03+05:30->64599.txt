Panaji: India’s loss against Kyrgyz Republic in the final Asian Cup 2019 qualifier did little to harm India’s reputation even though it was their first in 13 games. India had already qualified for the continental showpiece, big names, including captain Sunil Chhetri, were missing this game, yet fans were outraged.
 
  #ConstantineOut trended on Twitter on Tuesday evening. The win would have given India the highest ranking, and while coach Stephen   remains secure till the Asian Cup next year, his selection of players has evoked sharp criticism.
  
  One of the player who many fans believe should have at least got called for the camp is  . The   winger was impressive in the ISL, yet for all his runs down the flank, and some goals, his name does not figure anywhere in Constantine’s list.
  
  It’s been like this since December 2015. Remember that atrocious final against   FC and how, after the 2-3 loss in the final, Mandar and Romeo Fernandes both didn’t make it to the national camp for the SAFF Cup in Kerala? Many believed the FC Goa duo were held back by their club, although medical reports suggested that both were injured. Even the disciplinary committee was convinced that both didn’t deliberately stay away.
  
  Since December 2015, though, the 26-year-old hasn’t featured in Constantine’s plans.
  
  “What can I do? I can only continue to give my best and hope I get a call,” Mandar told reporters on Thursday.
  
  Asked if he expected a call at the end of the ISL campaign, Mandar did not hide his feelings.
  
  “I always expect a call from the national team but when I don’t, I simply tell myself that I will continue performing and leave it up to them (coach) to decide,” said Mandar.
  
  The   will be Mandar’s next big chance to catch Constantine’s attention.
