PATNA: The BJP-led   in Bihar hailed the policy framework of the 2017 central Budget and called it pro-rural, pro-poor and pro-farmers because of direct tax relief to the common man and, at the same time, increased outlays for various schemes which would help the state.

 “The Budget aims at job creation and also strikes at black money, apart from being focused on improving the life of the poor and giving a spur to the infrastructure development,” said former deputy CM and senior BJP functionary  , adding that the budgetary allotments would benefit Bihar that is qualified as backward economy, requiring massive public investments for growth.
 
 Modi said allotments have been substantially increased for MGNREGA, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, construction of toilets, Mudra Yojana, agriculture loan through primary agriculture credit societies (PACS), dairy processing, crop insurance and computerisation of cooperative banks. It would hugely benefit Bihar, he asserted.
 
 BJP’s state chief Nityanand Rai, his predecessor   and leader of opposition in the state assembly, Prem Kumar, also insisted that the budgetary allotments would certainly benefit the state. Kumar said the salaried class would be benefited by the change in the income tax slabs.
 
 Rai said Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) were being strengthened to provide update on soil health with a view to doubling the income of farmers by stressing on soil productivity and crop production. Stress has been given to skill development of the youths. 
 
 Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) general secretary and spokesman Sanjay Mehta, along with other functionaries of the party, described it a “balanced Budget”, maintaining that it has taken care of all the sectors of the economy. 
 
 Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and former CM   also welcomed the Budget. “The Budget will lead to overall development,” Manjhi said.
