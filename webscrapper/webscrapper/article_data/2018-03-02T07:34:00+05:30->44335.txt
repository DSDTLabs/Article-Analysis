Dharamshala: The Himachal soldier posted with the Sikh Regiment in Jammu and Kashmir, who had taken leave from duty to be with his family attacked by a man of the same village a month ago, has again demanded arrest or action against the accused.

 While the police had registered a case and a recovered blood-stained axe from the spot, the accused has not been arrested on grounds of mental illness.
 
 Sohan Singh had returned home on leave to "protect" his family after a government employee had attacked his elderly parents and wife.
 
 "I canâ€™t stay for long with my parents. Accused is still moving free, I demand at least some action against him to make him fearful of commiting crime again. The government should suspend him if he is mentally ill," he said, adding that accused was a repeat offender and police had been informed of threat from him even before the incident took place.
 
 Singh said the accused initially escaped arrest after getting himself admitted to the government hospital. "Before he could be discharged, he took bail from the court and thus has not been arrested," he added.
 
 Inquiries revealed that accused Rattan Chand was a government employee with the irrigation and public health department (I&PH).
 
 "He was shown absent from duty for last one month. Despite that no action has been taken against him," said Sohan Singh, who was going to meet the CM on his visit to Kangra on March 3.
 
 The incident had occurred in last week of January 2018, when Rattan Chand entered the house of the soldier's family and attacked all of them with a sharp axe.
 
 Superintendent of police Santosh Patial said they had registered the case under sections 307, 452, 323, 506, 504 of IPC.
 
 "We have also recovered blood stained weapon from the spot. The accused is on bail at present. But lawful action would be taken against him in this case" he added.
