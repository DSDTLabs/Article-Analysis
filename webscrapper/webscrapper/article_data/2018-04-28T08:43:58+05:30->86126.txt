HYDERABAD: Raking up the Kashmir issue,   chief minister   said the Centre should focus on resolving it through international channels instead of meddling in matters which can be handled by state governments. He also said it was unbecoming of the Centre to involve itself in the affairs of states. 

 He said: "Bombs are being hurled at our soldiers by Pakistan every day. The government should concentrate on international diplomacy to resolve the issue instead of getting itself involved in matters that can be taken care of by the state." He went to say, "Hundreds of soldiers are being killed and these incidents are occurring every day. Shouldn't the Centre be concentrating on protecting the lives of our soldiers?"
 
  also wondered as to why there should be a scheme like  . "A sarpanch can take care of laying roads in the village ...Why should the Centre involve in matters that can be easily managed by states," he questioned. He mentioned that several subjects, including health, education, rural and urban development, should be left completely to states and removed from concurrent list.
 
 Describing 'garibi hatao' as a 'faltoo' slogan, the CM said taking care of the well-being of people should be the responsibility of the states. 
 
 He said there is hardly any inland water transportation in India despite the country having several rivers. "The Centre has not done what it was supposed to do and did what it was not supposed to do," KCR said.
 
 He also wondered why India with its vast coastline and beaches was not developed enough as an international tourist destination. "Our people are going to foreign countries for tourism because our natural tourist locations have not been developed at all. When I called up a friend, he said he was holidaying in Bali. He went there because of the beaches. Why shouldn't Lakshadweep be developed as an international tourist destination," he asked.
