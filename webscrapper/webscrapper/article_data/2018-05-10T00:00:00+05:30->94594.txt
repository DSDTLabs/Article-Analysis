Keeping in mind the current system of   education in India, violinist   and playback singer   have collaborated with Jain (Deemed to be) University to offer   in the field of music. Speaking about the course, which will begin from June 2018, L Subramaniam says, “For a very long time, I have been dreaming about teaching music. Today if you see, there are colleges where you can get a degree in music. However, if as a performer, you are not able to gauge your audience’s attention, then that degree is of no use. Through Lakshminarayana Global Center of Excellence (LGCE), in collaboration with Jain (Deemed to be) University, we have decided to come up with diploma, BA, MA and Doctorate courses in music. ”

 How will this music course be different from others? “The course has been designed by me. Eighty % per cent of the focus will be on practical knowledge with theoretical knowledge as well. The course will also introduce students to Carnatic, western and global music, where they will gain knowledge about different instruments. Today, since musicians travel across the globe regularly, a course like this will allow them to understand music from all around the world,” says L Subramaniam, adding, “Our aim is not only to impart education to upcoming musicians and make them performers, but also to create educationists if they want to teach music to others.”
 
 The course will also allow students to have sessions with L Subramaniam, Kavita Krishnamurti, SaPa and artistes from around the world including those from the Norwegian Academy of Music and more.
