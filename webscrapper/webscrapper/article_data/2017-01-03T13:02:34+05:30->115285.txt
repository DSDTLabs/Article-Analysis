 
Recently released Gujarati film  , which is a story of a family that struggles to keep things together due to generation gap and how the mother tries her best to bridge up the gap between her and the children, provided a different strategy to attract more children to the theaters. The maker of the film,  , came up with a one of its kind offer where they provided one extra ticket to those who bought one themselves. Through this initiative, the film becomes one of the few films to have introduced a different marketing and promotional activity. 
 
  And the initiative sure showed the results at the occupancy as more than 25000 tickets were distributed in various schools in Ahmedabad. The film, despite fewer people going to the theaters due to demonetization and Dangal taking up most shows and screens, managed to sail through the tough times. 
  A concept of bringing together different generation on one platform and emphasizing the role of a mother in holding a family together has been subtly but effectively shown in the film Mission Mummy.
