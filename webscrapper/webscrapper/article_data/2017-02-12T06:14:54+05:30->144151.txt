KOLKATA: There's a significant drop in the number of candidates appearing in the   this year. While a staggering 11,44,097 candidates appeared in the board examination last year, the number stands at 10,72,000 this year, a drop of 75,000. Though the numbers have left officials of the   Board of Secondary Education baffled, Board administrator   reasoned that in 2016, the end of old syllabus had triggered the jump of 1,16,407 candidates from 2015. “Usually, there is an average 15,000 increase in the number of Madhyamik examinees every year. But, if any academic year sees the end of old curriculum, there is always a huge jump in the number of examinees.That is what had happened in 2016,“ said Ganguly. A similar trend was noticed when there was a switchover from old to new syllabus in 2009-2010.

 “Schools prefer not to fa il any examinee in the selection test. Once a candidate appears in Madhyamik with an old syllabus, even if he or she is unsuccessful, heshe will get another three attempts to clear the exam in the same syllabus. But, if a student is failed in test and new syllabus is introduced from the next academic session, he or she will have to start preparations in the new curriculum.“
 
 “It is very unfortunate that in order to shrug off responsibilities, schools allow all students to appear in Madhyamik. A screening is not done properly and the quality of merit is compromised,“ said former headmaster of a government school.
