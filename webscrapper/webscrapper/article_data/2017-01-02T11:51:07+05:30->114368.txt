JAIPUR: In November 2016, over 100 women gathered at Shaheed Smarak in the city to   addressed to Prime Minister   and chief minister  . They were seeking that Section 4 B of the   (NFSA), 2013, be expeditiously implemented, so all new mothers can take a little break from work and tend to their newborns. Little did the women know that by the year-end, the PM would address the nation announcing this grant, making no mention of NFSA. 

 In a press release on Sunday, the Rajasthan unit of the Right to Food Campaign and People's Union for Civil Liberties said, "The Prime Minister last night, on December 31, announced a cash entitlement of Rs 6,000 for pregnant women across the country, presenting it as an original idea and also as if it is somehow to mitigate the hardships caused by demonetisation. A universal maternity entitlement of at least Rs 6,000 has been for all pregnant and lactating women in the country since 2013, with the passing of the National Food Security Act (NFSA). This government, in complete violation of the Act, has continued with the pilot   (IGMSY) in just 53 districts of the country despite repeated demands by women across the country, civil society organisations as well as the Supreme Court asking for an explanation for the delay in implementation."
 
 The statement noted that IGMSY amount was increased to Rs 6,000 from Rs 4,000, to be in tune with NFSA. However, neither the coverage nor the budget allocated for the scheme had been enhanced. "The budget remained just Rs 400 crore, while around Rs 16,000 crore would be required to cover all pregnant women, who are around 29 million," the press release said, adding the real test would be to see how much allocation is made by the government in the budget next month.
 
 The press release also questioned why the cash transfer was conditional - to be provided only after the first two births to women above 18 years of age.
