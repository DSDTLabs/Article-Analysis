KOHIMA/GUWAHATI: The   assembly will hold a special session on Wednesday to test the majority support of chief minister Shurhozelie  , who has been facing a rebellion from a section of fellow Naga People’s Front (NPF) legislators.

 On Tuesday evening, Speaker Imtiwapang Aier called for a special session of the   following a directive from governor PB Acharya. The governor’s directive came soon after the   bench of the Gauhati high court on Tuesday afternoon dismissed a petition filed by Liezietsu, challenging Acharya’s call for a floor test to prove his majority.
 
 The high court verdict was pronounced by Justice LS Jamir, who had heard the case on Monday.
 
 The HC order is seen as a setback to Liezietsu, who had moved the court to avoid a trial of strength in the face of a revolt by party colleague TR Zeliang, whom he had replaced as CM earlier this year.
 
 A statement issued by Raj Bhavan said the HC upheld the governor’s decision to ask the CM for a vote of confidence in the assembly. In his petition, Liezietsu had sought time for a vote of confidence until July 29, when he would contest a bypoll from Northern Angami-I constituency to become a member of the assembly.
