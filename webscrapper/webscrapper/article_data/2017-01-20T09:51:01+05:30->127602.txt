JAIPUR: Among the last sessions on the first day of the Jaipur Lit Fest on Thursday was one on Indian Constitution.   moderated the discussion with legal luminaries  ,   and  .

 “Is the Constitution relevant in contemporary India?” The question was posed ahead of the discussion, and the audience was encouraged to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’. (Results had not come in, while this story was being filed)
 
 Addressing the question of the length of the Constitution – with 399 Articles and 11 Schedules – Khosla said that the founding fathers were grappling with “alien ideals”. How could the ground for democracy be laid in a society unfit for such rule? How could citizens be trained to be democratic? These were the issues that concerned the Constituent Assembly.
 
 Mehta explained that the constitutional arrangement of society meant that no single individual can become the custodian of the Constitution. B R Ambedkar would say that the adoption of the Constitution meant that ‘satyagraha’ was no longer justifiable.
 
 The speakers also dwelt on the increasing differences on public policies between the executive and the judiciary, and the apparent forfeiture of duties by the legislature. While Chandrachud claimed that the conflict between the executive and judiciary must be seen as healthy negotiation and balance of power, Desai expressed concern at differences being so strident and played out publicly. “In the Constituent Assembly, there were no such differences on the basis of political parties,” he said.
 
 Khosla reminded the audience that the Constitution alone cannot be expected to “fix” all the differences. In the matter of Uniform Civil Code, for instance, he explained, there needs to be a political consensus before any change in the Constitution was possible, for it to gain legitimacy, he said.
