NEW DELHI: Reiterating its earlier stand, the Delhi high court on Wednesday told the AAP government to "stay its hands" on proposed purchase of   for Delhi. 

 HC said it won't allow procurement that may lead to violation of the fundamental rights of disabled persons who would find it difficult to access such vehicles, a point highlighted in a PIL by  .
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said it would "not permit tender for standard floor buses to go through" while hearing the PIL by Malhotra, who suffers from a locomotor disability and has challenged the government's move to procure 2,000 standard-floor buses for Rs 300 crore.
 
  Though the petitioner urged the bench to stay the tender floated for the procurement of the buses, the court refrained from giving an interim order, but indicated it expected the government to stay put. 
 
  Meanwhile, the bench also directed DTC to design a module to train and sensitise its staff, particularly drivers, towards the needs of persons with disabilities and noted that the drivers often stop or park the buses in the middle of the road, preventing disabled from accessing the vehicles. 
 
 With this direction, the court listed the matter for further hearing on March 19.
 
  The court also gave the Delhi government time to file the minutes of the meetings held by the chief secretary with other officials on formulating an action plan on the nature of parking spaces, their design and the timeline within which the construction would be completed and their location.
