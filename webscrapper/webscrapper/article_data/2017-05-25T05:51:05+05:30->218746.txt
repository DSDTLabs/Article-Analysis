HUBBALLI:   might be situated between the airport and the  , but it   like  ,  . In the absence of toilets, the residents here are still practicing open defecation. 

 Since several years, the area has no drainage system, public transport and government school. In the absence of a concrete road, residents struggle to reach their house, especially in the rainy season. The interior roads are riddled with big potholes and are inundated when it rains.
 
 During monsoon, it is common to witness bikes skid and pedestrians trip on the slushy roads. Many pedestrians and vehicle users have suffered minor injuries in such cases. 
 
 Premanath Chikkatumbal, secretary, Jagadish Nagar Ashraya Residents Welfare Committee, told TOI that though there are 424 families in the colony, residents are yet to get potable water from Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board. "They depend on water from borewells, but this water is not clean. So the residents are facing many health problems," he said.
 
 The two borewells in the area fail to meet the water requirement of the residents. 
 
 "We have submitted memorandums to the HDMC many times, but there is no response to our demands," he added.
 
 Vishwanath Bhandari, a resident of Ashraya Colony, said that the NWKRTC does not offer bus services to the area yet. "We are depending on private transport. Otherwise, we have to walk from 1km from the main road. Hundreds of children are going to the school in the nearby area because our area doesn't have any government school. We have appealed to the elected representatives many a times, but they haven't considered our demand," he said. 
 
 HDMC special officer S H Naregal promised to resolve the problems in Jagadish Nagar Ashraya Colony soon.
