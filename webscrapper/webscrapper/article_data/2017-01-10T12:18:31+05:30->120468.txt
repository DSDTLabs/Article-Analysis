On January 9, the accused principal has been booked under charges of rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), based on the video. He is on the run, while the children who were seen in the video have also gone missing.
 
 “The video was shot more than month back by some school students after they came to know about the misdeeds of the principal,” said RK Mishra, investigating officer, adding that the video went viral on social media only a couple of days back. When asked about the minor victims, the investigating officer said the girl seen in the video had gone back to her parents abou a month ago. The accused principal too has been missing too for the past 15 days.
 
 Mishra said, “On January 10, the minor victims may come down to Harpalpur along with their parents."
 
 Police said that most of the children in the school belong to neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.
