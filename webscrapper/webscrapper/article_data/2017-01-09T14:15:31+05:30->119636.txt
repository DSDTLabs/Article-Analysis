THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   state unit has demanded  's urgent intervention to declare the entire digital transactions free of additional charges by banks.
 
 In a letter to Reserve bank governor   and RBI regional director S M Narasimha Swami here, BJP state general secretary M T Ramesh said if the service and other charges levied by banks on digital transaction of money is not withdrawn, the same would jeopardize the demonetisation drive by the Union government.
  
 "As you are aware, after Prime Minister  's clarion call for demonetization, the country is accelerating towards digital currency. Tremendous efforts are being taken to literate the common man who is unaware of the technological knowhow to pursue digital transitions. Itâ€™s highly regretful that the approach taken by the banks in India are one which drive away common man from this digital endeavour. Charging ATM transactions after the prescribed limit. Merchant Discount Rates (MDR) for debit card transactions, charging service tax on digital transactions etc would only result in further alienating the common man from digital transactions. This, if allowed to continue, would seriously jeopardise the great initiative taken by the government to reduce the cause of paper currency. It is ironical that the RBI is hand in glove in the process. In these circumstances, it is desirable that the entire digital transactions are made free of charge," the letter said.
