MUMBAI:The   on Saturday demanded action against officials of the   for alleged extortion at Nehru Nagar slums in Vile Parle. On Friday TOI had reported the arrest of slum survey supervisor Umesh Padmashali for accepting Rs 5,000 of the total Rs 35,000 to classify a slum tenement eligible for free housing under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme. 

 Swati Karle, deputy collector, encroachments had claimed while her office was overseeing the numbering of tenements eligible for free housing, no official from her department was present when the alleged incident occurred on February 2. 
 
 In a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, former MP   has demanded an immediate stop to the survey and an enquiry to ascertain if the official was taking money for himself or for the whole team, in which case action should be taken against all the officials involved. 
 
 “Government officials are trying to protect themselves by saying the survey agency -- MahaOnline -- is a private agency. However, they were assisted by deputy collectors and tehsildars. Also, any agency working on behalf of the government attracts the tag of public servant. Hence, the accused must be arrested and prosecuted as public servants along with government officials involved in the crime,” said Kamat in his letter. 
 
 The party has been demanding the government reveal rehabilitation plans as restrictions around the Juhu airport do not allow for in-situ rehabilitation. Local BJP MLA Ameet Satam said the guilty must be punished. “The chief minister has announced in-situ rehabilitation. The Congress is merely pursuing its political interests and creating a controversy,” he said. Karle, however, said the survey is being carried out at the behest of the union civil aviation ministry, while housing department officials said all central agencies owning land in Mumbai including AAI have turned down the state’s request to hand over surplus land for affordable housing.
