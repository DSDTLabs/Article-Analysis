NEW DELHI: Calling BJP’s decision to replace all sitting   for the upcoming corporation elections as admission of guilt, Aam Aadmi Party has said that by not taking action against the sitting councillors for the rampant corruption in the corporation,   is trying to fool the people of Delhi.

 AAP’s Delhi convenor Dilip Pandey said that BJP’s recent announcement has proved all allegations levelled by   against its councillors. 
 
 “We have been saying that BJP and Congress have turned Delhi into a dustbin while corruption is extreme in matters like waste collection, pensions, salaries and revenue collection. By saying that no sitting councillor will get a ticket, BJP has admitted that all of them are liabilities,” Pandey said.
 
 “But, no action is being initiated against the councillors. Now BJP is bringing in a fresh crop of people who want to loot Delhi even more,” he added.
 
 Earlier on Thursday, state BJP chief Manoj Tiwari admitted that senior BJP members, including himself, were unhappy with the way the corporations have been managed. “We are not happy with the existing state of affairs, which is why we decided to change things. Even I am not happy with the way the corporations have been functioning. I have also been harassed by them,” he said.
