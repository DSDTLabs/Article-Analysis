CHANDIGARH: Officials in   are preparing a proposal to have another extension of the Advanced Eye Centre ( ). At present, there is no centre which has an extension. "We get many patients in the hospital and there is a need for extension. Our OPD counts have increased over a period of time," said PGI director Dr Jagat Ram. 

 As per the "mera aspataal" survey conducted by the ministry of health and family welfare, after the medicine OPD, the highest patient inflow is in AEC, PGI. 
 
 A total of 22,535 patients have been examined in the centre in January and the number of patients has increased 15 times since its establishment in 2005.
 
 The mera aspataal survey gave a list of 31 departments in PGI, out of which maximum patients (12%) visited the departments of eye centre, and medicine, (13%) in January this year. The AEC manages one-fourth of the work load in the institute with only 67 doctors. 
 
 "Despite the rush, these doctors have been working overtime, sometimes handling 1,400 OPD counts in a day," said a faculty member in PGI.
 
 The area has to be earmarked and a detailed plan has to be prepared. At any given time, all the rooms in the Centre are full of patients who come from far flung areas of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and  .
 
  "The centre has state of the art services and treatment for simple to complex issues. Also, the success rate of the surgeries is high. With this trust, more and more patients want to come to the AEC," said a faculty member. 
 
 The most crowded OPDs in the hospital are of the eye, medicine and endocrinology. "If there is scope for extension of the eye centre, why cannot there be another emergency which is always choc-a block," said a senior resident.
