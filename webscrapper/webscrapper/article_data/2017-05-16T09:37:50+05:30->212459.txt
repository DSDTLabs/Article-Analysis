NOIDA: Youth of   (youth) Manch (NUYM) - a local youth body - organised a signature   under   over the weekend (Saturday) at Wave City Centre   (which has sector 39A on one side and sector 32 on the other). 

 Nearly 400 residents/commuters participated in the campaign by way of signing a petition and taking oath towards maintaining clean environs. Members of the Manch also took to brooms and cleaned the area near metro station to mark the occasion.
 
 “Under Swachh Bharat Mission members of NUYM collected at Wave   on Saturday and carried out a signature campaign to generate awareness on cleanliness and clean surroundings at the entrance to the metro station. Nearly 400 residents of neighbouring sectors as well as commuters participated in the campaign and took a pledge towards cleanliness,” said Pushkar Sharma, founder and president NUYM who adds that the campaign was kick-started by a staff of the metro station who was the first signatory to pledge clean environs.
 
 On the occasion, Mayank Dubey, another staffer of the metro station said that the drive will actually be successful in real terms only if every citizen inherently feels that he wants to live in clean surroundings and works towards achieving that. “Only then changes on the ground would be visible,” said Dubey.
 
 While Sharma added that the cleanliness drive has become a habit with some who are determined to ensure that it reaches maximum numbers in generating awareness, members of NUYM took to the broom and cleaned the area near the metro station to drive home the message further.
 
 Other members of NUYM who signed the signature campaign along with commuters and residents include Abhishek Kanaujia, Raj Mandal, Mohan Saha, Anmol Sehgal, Abhay Prajapati, Deepak Choudhary, Satyavan Khillar, Ankush Prajapati, Vivek Singh and more.
