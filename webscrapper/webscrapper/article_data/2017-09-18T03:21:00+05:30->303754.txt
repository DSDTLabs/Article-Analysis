Poinguinnim: With adequate manpower deployed and a systemic mechanism for collection of waste initiated, the problem of garbage in the vicinity of waterfalls in Canacona’s hinterland is now relatively under control. These initiatives have been undertaken by the forest department and the local panchayats, Canacona’s topography, with hills and scenic waterfalls, draws hoards of visitors. Bamonbuddo near the border of the taluka, Bhupar in Gaondongorim panchayat and Kuskem in Cotigao are some of the heavily frequented spots. A few years back, the increasing amount of garbage that visitors left behind in the vicinity of the Bamonbuddo waterfall had angered the villagers. Now, two policemen are deployed there on weekends.  In Kuskem, the forest department has deployed workers to keep the place clean. The forest department also collects a nominal entry fee and this amount goes towards the maintenance of the tourist spot. However, the Bhupar waterfall remains neglected. Gaondongorim sarpanch Suman M Gaonkar said, “We have put up boards regarding ban on liquor and garbage.” Local residents though are wary as the pool below the waterfall is source of drinking water.
