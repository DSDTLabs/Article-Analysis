KOCHI: There is scope for a preliminary inquiry into the allegations raised against finance secretary   but scope for prosecuting him for corruption requires further verification, the   (VACB) informed the high court.

 The submission by VACB was in response to a petition filed by  , former deputy director of collegiate education. In a petition filed before VACB director, the petitioner had alleged that loss of Rs20 crore was caused to the government by K M Abraham by re-designating grade four librarians as   librarians.
 
 Responding to the petition, VACB's statement said, “It is submitted that the scope for prosecution under PC Act ( ) in these petitions can be ascertained only after verification of facts in connection with the allegations raised. However, it is admitted that there is scope for a prelimi nary enquiry in the matters raised in these petitions.“
 
 While librarians had to have a post graduate degree in Library Science with 55% marks and NET qualification to be eligible for UGC scale of pay , as per a 1999 government order, KM Abraham issued an order on May 9, 2008 giving relaxation to grade four librarians who possess only bachelor degree in Library Science working in aided colleges. Those with eight years of service were re-designated as UGC librarians on the condi tion that they should obtain NET qualification within four years or attend four refresher courses, it was alleged. Such relaxation was granted at a time when post-graduate degree holders could not apply to the post without NET qualification, the petition said. On account of the relaxation, grade four librarians drew arrears of salary from 2004 that ranged from Rs10-15 lakh. They are presently drawing Rs50,000 more than what is eligible to them, the petitioner had alleged.
