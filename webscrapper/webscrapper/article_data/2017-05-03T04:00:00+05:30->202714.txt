Surat: When Surat is preparing to become country’s first smart city, several key posts of officers have been lying vacant in the district administration since a long time, affecting the functioning of the administrative machinery.  Farmer leader Darshan Nayak, who had filed an application under Right to Information (RTI) Act, was provided a list of 38 key posts in the district administration by the district collector’s office and also informed that 29 of these posts were lying vacant since a long time. While 50 per cent of the vacant posts are being looked after by in-charge officers from other departments, the rest do not even have in-charge officers.  There are nine talukas in Surat district and of them five don’t have mamlatdars. The talukas without mamlatdars are: Palsana, Choryasi, Kamrej, Bardoli and Surat city. Informatively, Surat city’s vacant mamlatdar post has Y G Mehta, mamlatdar ULC, holding the charge; mamlatdar Choryasi’s post is being held by I J Gamit, public relation officer Surat; mamlatdar Kamrej’s post is with B I Patel, deputy mamlatdar; and mamlatdar Bardoli’s post is with mamlatdar of Mahuva, R M Chauhan.  Several key posts like deputy collector, protocol, deputy collector Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA), deputy collector stamp duty, regional transport officer, Chitnis to collector, additional chitnis to district collector, mamlatdar (entertainment department), mamlatdar (NA), mamlatdar (small savings), mamlatdar (disaster cell), mamlatdar (irrigation tax recovery), mamlatdar (ceiling), mamlatdar (Surat city), mamlatdar (Adajan) and mamlatdar (Puna) are lying vacant.  “Mamlatdar is the most important officer in a taluka.

The administration in talukas is suffering without mamlatdars,” Darshan Nayak said.
