Slamming courts that insist on unusual bail conditions such as the person standing surety being a   or able to surrender property documents, the Madras high court has said even Mahatma Gandhi could not stand surety to anyone as he was never a government servant. 

 Even a beggar can stand surety, said  , adding that when a   could be a voter, why could he not stand surety in court. Pointing out that the Code of Criminal Procedure didn't insist on property document, title deeds being produced either by the person standing surety or the accused, he said: "There are many private individuals having sterling qualities. Mahatma Gandhi is not a government servant. But he is Father of our Nation. Yet, as per the present practice being adopted by certain criminal courts, even Mahatma Gandhi cannot be accepted as surety..."
 
 While granting bail, criminal courts routinely lay conditions ranging from a personal bond to a 'blood' relative, a government servant or a person able to deposit property documents stanmding surety. Unlike civil cases where a guarantor should pay the sum owed by the man to whom he stood surety, a person standing surety to an accused would not be arrested or made to pay if the beneficiary disappears.
 
 Disapproving of the practice, Justice Devadas said: "Courts demanding production of  , residence certificate, solvency certificate or tahsildar certificate are not mentioned in the CrPC. These are all creations and inventions of certain courts. It is clear that these are all not out of any judicial thinking. It is out of a useless thinking, curbing the liberty of the individual." It cannot be said that all government servants, public servants were Buddhas, the judge said. 
 
 Courts can ascertain the genuineness of the person standing surety and he may be asked to produce residential proof. "He should not be a vagabond. He should establish his identity. A surety can be a person without having own house... "
