PATIALA: Saying that he did it or the good of the community, Nihang Charanjit Singh, who was arrested for allegedly beheading the head of   in   district, on July 13, has refused to contest the case. He maintained that he had no remorse over the incident and would not engage a counsel to fight his case. On Saturday, he was produced in a court, which sent him to police remand for five days.

 Charanjit (40) had allegedly killed Baba   (45) of Ratia in Fatehabad district of Haryana. He allegedly beheaded Pyara with a single blow of the sword and then created ruckus by climbing the dome of the gurdwara at the time of his arrest. After a lot of persuasion he climbed down and was arrested. The gurdwara is managed by Baba Balbir Singh of Patiala, who has also faced several attacks on himself and his family in the past.
 
 Earlier, when he was produced in a local court, the accused without any hint of guilt said that, “I have no remorse over the incident. Pyara was indulging in womanising and use to bring women to gurdwara. I took the step for the betterment of the community and there is no rivalry behind the incident. I also refused to take any advocate to contest my case.”
 
 On the other hand, the police have booked five more accused in the case under charges of criminal conspiracy. Fatehgarh Sahib SHO   said that, “We have booked five more accused under criminal conspiracy but none of them have been arrested yet.” These persons are reportedly from the village and had some old rivalry with the Pyara Singh.
