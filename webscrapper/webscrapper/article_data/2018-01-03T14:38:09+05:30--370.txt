COIMBATORE: If everything goes well,   authorities will soon install   cameras and   at its 80 outlets in the district as a pilot project to curb break-ins and avoid incidents of employees, who now carry sales amount with them, being attacked by burglars.

 Two months ago, some miscreants had robbed Tasmac shop employees of more than Rs 4 lakh while they were taking sales amount with them at night.
 
 There are 237 Tasmac outlets in the district. Since some outlets do not have CCTV cameras and burglar alarms, Tasmac shop employees are forced to take the sales amount with them every night.
 
 “If we keep the sales amount in the locker of the Tasmac outlet, chances of burglary are high. Whenever burglars break into Tasmac outlets and make away with the sales amount, police personnel torture us in the name of inquiry. The police attempt to create a link between the burglars and us. To avoid such situations, we take the sales amount with us every night,” said an employee of a Tasmac outlet who didn’t want to be named.
 
 To ensure its staff’s welfare, Tasmac authorities now plan to install 80 CCTV cameras in as many outlets. “We are going to fix CCTV cameras in 80 Tasmac outlets in Coimbatore as a pilot project. The sales amount will be stored in the locker of the outlet. The cameras will be connected to the respective Tasmac district managers’ offices. The CCTV footage will be stored for 30 days. Likewise, 80 burglar alarms will also be installed in as many Tasmac outlets soon to prevent burglary,” said a senior Tasmac officer here.
 
 In November last, some miscreants waylaid a two-wheeler near   and assaulted Tasmac supervisor   and took away from him Rs 2.88 lakh. In the same month, a four-member gang waylaid two Tasmac salesmen on  , assaulted them and took away Rs 1.60 lakh from them. 
 
 The Coimbatore rural police had subsequently registered two cases and formed special teams to nab the burglars.
