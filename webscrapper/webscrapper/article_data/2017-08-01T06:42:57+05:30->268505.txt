CHENNAI: Bike racing, seemingly confined to East Coast   (ECR) and othern southern stretches, appears to have shifted to Grand North Trunk (GNT) Road where an incident on Saturday night killed a pedestrian. The two ‘racers’ involved were injured.

 The body of the deceased, said to be around 50 years old, is now at the   (SMCH) for autopsy. His photograph has been sent to all police stations in the city and its suburbs.
 
 The injured, Ernavur residents  , 20, and Srinivasan, 21, were admitted to SMCH and later shifted to a corporate hospital. The students of a private college were charged with rash and negligent driving and and arrested.
 
 Witnesses told police the pedestrian was crossing Ennore Expressway when he saw the bikes hurtling towards him. He panicked and stepped back to avoid the first bike and was hit by both. The man was thrown on to the road, while the bikers lost control and smashed into a roadside wall.
 
 Investigators are now looking into whether some friends of the injured were also involved in racing on teh stretch.
 
 Police commissioner A K Viswanathan has already instructed his officers to act tough against such racers. On ECR, police have put up many barricades. “Such steps have helped bring down accidents due to bike racing on ECR,” an officer said.
 
 Now, police have been asked to barricade stretches on GNT Road and adjoining arterial stretches and intensify checks.
