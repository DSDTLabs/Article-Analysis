NEW DELHI:   has   LG Anil   to seek   over the   of   AAP MLA Kailash   as   in Delhi government. Sources said leader of opposition Vijender Gupta was likely to raise the issue of Gahlot’s presence in the assembly when the house convenes for the Budget session on Friday. 

 Praveen Shankar Kapoor, spokesperson of Delhi BJP, on Thursday wrote a letter to LG to draw his attention to the matter. While a disqualified MLA is barred from attending the assembly sessions, Speaker R N Goel has said Gahlot can continue as minister for six months and even attend House sessions during the period. 
 
 In his letter, a copy of which he claimed to have sent to home minister Rajanth Singh, Kapoor wrote: “Gahlot has ceased to be a member of the assembly after being disqualified as per the directive of the President after he was found guilty, along with 20 AAP MLAs, for holding the office of profit... (sic).” 
 
 Class IV of Article 164 of the Constitution states that a person can only continue as a minister for six months, unless within that period, he/she gets elected as a member of the legislature. But this provision refers to a non-member who has been made a minister, and is silent on the fate of an MP/MLA who was a minister to begin with, but stands disqualified now. While Article 191 is clear that holding an office of profit disqualifies the person from being an MP or MLA, there is little clarity on what happens to the portfolio. While experts opine that Gahlot’s continuance as minister is open to legal challenge, the government maintains that even a disqualified MLA enjoys the six-month window till election, which is, otherwise, available to a non-member who gets appointed as a minister.
 
 “It is an immoral act that Gahlot continues to be a minister even after disqualification. He should again take the oath,” Gupta said.
