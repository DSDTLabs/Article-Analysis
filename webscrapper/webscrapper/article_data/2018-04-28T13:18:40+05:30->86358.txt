AGARTALA: Taking on   chief minister   yet again,   chief minister   on Friday challenged her to compare the economic growth of the two states after two years. 

 "After three years, I want to compete with   didi regarding the economic growth and development of Tripura and West Bengal. I want help from all my civil service officers and the people of Tripura to take the state to a new height. That would be a fitting reply to her,"   said at a civil service day event here.
 
 Mamata had earlier compared BJP's win in Tripura to "winning the municipal elections", following which Biplab drew flak for saying she should get "her brain checked".
 
 On Friday, on the defensive, Biplab said, "The status of every state is equal, as is the status of the chief minister of every state. But she hurt these sentiments in public." He added, "The length and size do not matter. What matters is the length and spread of your thought and vision. Had size matters I have been the big individual, as I am six feet and three inch. In the administration, there are people who are shorter than I am but they are more knowledgeable than me and many politicians. The way she commented and equated my lovely Tripura with a municipality is absolutely wrong and insulting."
