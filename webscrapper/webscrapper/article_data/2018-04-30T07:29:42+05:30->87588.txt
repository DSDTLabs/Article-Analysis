BENGALURU: Flooded with complaints of technical glitches from passengers, the   ( ) has decided to upgrade its mobile application.

 The app, commuters say, isn’t helpful in tracking buses real time and lacks several features that are provided by cab aggregators. 
 
 BMTC officials say the app, launched in 2016, was developed by Trimax IT Infrastructure and Services as part of the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) project, based on GPS fitted in its 6,400-odd buses. MD V Ponnuraj, said: “We are sorting out the issues and will come out with an advanced version of the app with more features, including emergency panic button for women passengers.”
 
 Sources say all buses are being tracked with the help of GPS but the app fails to update commuters when buses are re-routed by depot managers. “This happens because each bus number and route is entered in the system, which doesn’t get updated when re-routing is done during emergencies,” an official said.
 
 He added that depot managers are being told to update information online in case of emergency re-routing so that customers have access to accurate information. “The private app developer who was selected for this project is also not updating it regularly,” another official said.
 
 K Ashok, a regular BMTC passenger, said: “In uninstalled the app becausae it takes too much time to load and doesn’t even open at times.”

 Passengers can now track their complaints filed through Twitter or the call centre on BMTC website — www.mybmtc.com/en/basic-page/customer-grievance. Officials said passengers can search their complaint status after entering the docket number. They said a majority of complaints are lodged against bus conductors and drivers for misbehaviour, refusing to give change and skipping bus stops or route.
