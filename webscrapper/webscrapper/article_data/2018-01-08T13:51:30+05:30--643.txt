The winners will be given handmade art and craft items from Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan. 
 
 Kishor said kite flyers of international fame like   and Dabaljeet Choudhary from New Delhi would showcase their talent and teach people about the tactics of kite flying. People can either come with the kite or they can buy designer kites which are being brought from New Delhi. There will also be a counter selling packaged dahi-chura, tilkut and jalebi for Rs50 each packet. 
 
 Kishor has strictly asked people not to use ‘Chinese manja’ during the kite festival. He also assured the participants of proper safety and said magistrates and cops in sufficient number would be deployed at Gandhi Maidan. Talking about kites, Kishor said, “A kite flies high in the sky because of the strong base it is attached to. Similarly, those having strong principles reach the zenith in their lives.”
 
 However, there will be no kite festival this year in the Ganga diara, which used to be an annual event organized by state tourism department on the occasion of   every year. 
 
 The decision was taken keeping in mind the boat tragedy which had claimed 24 lives on the Makar Sankranti day last year.
