Dahej: Emboldened by the latest GDP numbers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday strongly justified his November 8 demonetization decision and said that all the canards of India’s economy collapsing that were spread by the critics have been completely defied.

 “There were a number of canards spread and attempts were made to create an impression that there would be an apocalypse…the economy would collapse and GDP would plummet. Some people were sure to bear the brunt of his decision. But nothing of this sort happened and India is on a path of fast-paced development,” Modi said in Dahej after inaugurating ONGC Petroadditions Ltd’s (OPaL) Rs 27,000 crore plant.
 
 The latest GDP data released by the Central Statistical Organization revealed that India had achieved 7% GDP growth in the October-December quarter.
 
 Modi cited a galaxy of global corporate giants like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bangladesh Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and others who have lauded demonetization decision.
 
 “Today, the entire world is seeing this decision with respect,” Modi said to a thunderous applause.
 
 The PM said that all sectors—be it financial or social- would ultimately benefit when black money is squeezed out of the economy.
