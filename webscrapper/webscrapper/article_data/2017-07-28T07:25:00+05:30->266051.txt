 Chandigarh: People using app-based cabs to travel suffered as their prices shot up on Thursday. 
 
 “I usually pay Rs 220 to Rs 250 to travel from Zirakpur to Panjab University. But today, the cab charged Rs 457 for the same distance. Moreover, there was no traffic when I came. These app-based cabs announce a price surge whenever there is an emergency. What is the point of using these cabs if there is no emergency,” rued Sahil Mor, a student of Panjab University. He said the app-based cabs doubled charges for rides within the city all day. 
 
 Deepti Swami, another user of app-based cabs, who had to travel from Sector 21 to Sector 10 was charged Rs 118 in the morning. When she returned from Sector 10 to Sector 21, she was charged Rs 68 for the same distance. 
 
 Kavita, a cab user from Sector 18 said she was charged Rs 72 to go from Sector 18 to Sector 8, a distance which normally costs under Rs 55.
