KOLKATA: The   Wholesalers and Bonders Association has appealed to chief minister   to reverse the decision of setting up a corporation to deal with wholesale   trade. The state has formed a corporation called  , which will take up the wholesale trade of India Made Foreign Liquor and country spirits from April. 

 At present, there are wholesalers for IMFL, while country spirit retailers buy directly from the firms. 
 
 The spokesperson of the association said it is hoping for a favourable response from the state. The association has claimed that over Rs 650 crore will be at stake if the wholesale business is taken over by the state-owned corporation. “The retailers have a due of Rs 650 crore with us, which is bank money. If the trade model changes, then the money will be at stake.”
 
 “The setting up of the corporation will force wholesalers to close down their business and 5,000 employees will become unemployed. In addition, around 12,000 people who are indirectly involved in this job will lose their employment,” the association wrote to the CM. 
 
  The spokesperson also pointed out that there is hardly any illegal IMFL trade in Bengal. “We have created an infrastructure for warehousing and distribution of liquor. Now, if the state wants to create new infrastructure, the cost element will be high. The state has appointed a new CEO and people in other positions for the corporation. Besides, the state has to acquire land for setting up warehouses,” the spokesperson added. 
 
 However, state officials are hopeful that this will lead to a jump in liquor revenue. According to the new rule, the state will coordinate directly with IMFL companies. It will turn wholesalers for country spirits as well. The officials feel that there could be an additional revenue of Rs 100-200 crore because of this.
