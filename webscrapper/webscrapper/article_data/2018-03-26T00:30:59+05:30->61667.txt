HYDERABAD: Tension prevailed in   town after some miscreants pelted stones at a shrine during the   procession on Sunday evening. Police resorted to lathicharge and used tear gas shells to control the situation. 

 Adilabad SP and Nizamabad police commissioner Karthikeya were asked by top brass of the Telangana Police to immediately reach Nirmal to take stock of the situation.
 
 The incident took place when the religious procession had almost reached its scheduled destination.
 
 "The situation was brought under control and police are talking to members of both the communities to bring normalcy in the area. It was an isolated incident," additional director general of police (law and order) Jitender told TOI.
