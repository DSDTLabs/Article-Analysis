HYDERABAD: Rachakonda police commissioner   on Thursday suspended one sub-inspector, one head constable and two constables of   (SOT) over allegations that they had syphoned Rs 53,000 out of the total cash seized after busting a cricket betting racket. 

 
 The accused cops from SOT have been identified as   (29), sub-inspector, Mohd Shamsuddin (56), the head constable, Srinivas (32) and Mohd Tausif (30) - the constables.
 
 Around 16 days ago, Rachakonda Special Operation Team had busted a cricket betting racket. The police had raided a house at Medipally and seven persons were arrested under gambling act. Though the seized amount was around Rs 1,33,000, but the four cops from SOT allegedly showed seized amount to be Rs 80,000. 
 
 "The seven persons arrested during the raid had alleged that Rs 53,000 more was seized by the accused policemen, who shared the money among themselves. The four policemen have been suspended till the enquiry finishes. However, these four cops have denied the allegations," said police. 
 
 According to a police source, the decision of suspending the cops was taken after a preliminary investigation by special branch, while departmental enquiry is yet to take place. "Telangana police is known for its friendly policing and have gained respect in the country. These kind of problems bring bad name to the department," said Bhagwat.
 
 Recently, two police constables were suspended by Hyderabad police commissioner  , after they allegedly misbehaved with a civilian.
