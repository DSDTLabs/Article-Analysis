Panaji: The Consul General of Portugal in Goa, Francisco Duarte Azevedo, urged people to look forward to a “bright future between India and Portugal”. He was inaugurating the Portuguese Film Festival on Friday that kick started the ninth edition of   da Cultura Indo- Portuguesa.

 Rajendra Talak, vice-chairman Entertainment Society of Goa, said both Goa and Portugal face similar problems when it comes to making films -good directors, but lack of funds. Goa has taken an initiative in reviving Goan cinema where the government provides funding and theatres for the release of films. “That’s why the number of films produced in Goa are increasing day by day. Almost eight to nine films are produced every year and we are making a mark. We are receiving national awards every year. This is very important for Goa,” he said. 
 
 He offered ESG’s support in ensuring that the Portuguese Film Festival remains an annual event. Six critically acclaimed films are being screened over three days during the festival. 
 
 Audhut Caro, chairman of the executive committee of Semana da Cultura Indo Portuguesa (Goa), said “it is an opportunity for both India and Portugal to share and enjoy the essence of diverse cultures”. 
 
 Semana da Cultura Indo Portuguesa (Goa) will host the fado singing competition, and has also partnered with Fundacao Oriente to host the popular Vem Cantar and Goan short story competition.
