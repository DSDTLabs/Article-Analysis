PATNA: Contrary to the common perception that prohibition is causing revenue loss to the   exchequer, official records say a whopping Rs 5,280 crore is saved due to it every year, and it circulates into economy.

 Economists had earlier quoted figures in the range of Rs 5,000-6,000 crore as losses due to prohibition. However, the state government claims savings by people on the basis of studies undertaken by Patna-based Asian   (ADRI).
 
 The state’s economic survey report for 2017-18 says there were around 44 lakh boozers in the state when the sale and consumption of liquor was made an offence in April 2016. Taking into account the 2011 consumption figures, the report says, “Even by conservative estimates, each drinker was spending at least Rs 1,000 per month on alcohol. On this basis, there is saving of at least Rs 440 crore every month, which calculates to Rs 5,280 crore per year.”
 
 The ADRI study has also factored in sales figures of milk products during the period. There was a substantial 17.5% increase in the sale of Sudha milk products in 2016-17, compared to a year before, the report says and adds the total consumption of milk and milk products would be even higher if the sales figures of other players are also included.
 
 The ADRI study also reports surge in sales of items such as expensive saris (1715%), expensive dress material (910%), processed food (46%), plastic goods (65%) and furniture (20%), among others.
 
 It says with more purchasing power, more people purchased four-wheelers (30%), tractors (29%) and two and three-wheelers (32%).
 
 A section of economists, however, dispute such studies. “How can you say that the amount earlier spent on liquor is now being spent on milk products, vehicles and other items? The findings do not seem to have been gathered from the ground,” said D M Diwakar, social scientist and professor of economics at Patna-based A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies.
