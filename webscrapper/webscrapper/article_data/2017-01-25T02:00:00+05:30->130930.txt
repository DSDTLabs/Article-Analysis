PATNA: The JP roundabout turned into a battlefield on Tuesday with   (Loktantrik) activists fighting a pitched battle with the police. 

 The clash broke out when the JAP (L) workers led by party chief Rajesh Ranjan alias  , who had gathered near Kargil Chowk to protest demonetisation and demand action against those holding benami property, were stopped from marching to Raj Bhavan.
 
 The police had to use water cannon to disperse the JAP (L) activists, who were trying to break the barricade. As the situation went out of control, the police resorted to lathi charge. JAP (L) functionaries alleged that at least 30 of their party workers were injured in the lathi charge and all of them are undergoing treatment at hospitals. 
 
 City SP Chandan Kushwaha, however, said only person was injured in the clash. “Though a magistrate and police personnel were there on the spot, JAP (L) workers did not talk to them and started pelting the policemen with stones. At least six policemen were injured in stone pelting,” Kushwaha said, adding that an FIR has been lodged against Yadav and other JAP (L) workers with Gandhi Maidan police station.
 
 Yadav, on the other hand, criticised the police for using force against his party workers. He said the government was trying to supress the voice of the common people. Without taking name of any particular leader, Yadav said those who organised programmes on Tuesday to mark Karpori Jayanti were actually misusing the socialist leader’s name. “People who did not own a cycle have amassed huge property now,” he alleged. Yadav also criticised chief minister Nitish Kumar for spending a huge amount in organising the human chain event. “From where did he get money for six helicopters and 38 drones?” Yadav asked.
 
 Meanwhile, the JAP (L) protest led to a massive traffic snarl in the city with vehicles remaining stranded around Gandhi Maidan, Dak Bungalow roundabout and Exhibition Road for several hours.
