PATNA: The state transport department will soon set up driving schools on public-private partnership (PPP) mode in all 38 districts in the state. The bidding process for that has already been initiated and firms interested in setting up the schools have been asked to submit their tenders by the end of this month. 

 
 “The central government will give 50% or up to Rs1 crore subsidy on the cost of setting up an institute, which requires approximately two acre land. The land could either belong to the agency or be taken on lease. The land can also be located outside the town area. In the next phase, the department plans to set up two driving schools in bigger districts,” state transport secretary   said on Tuesday.
 
 Agarwal said the maintenance of the institute and its revenue will be handled by the private agency. “The   will be a mini version of the   (IDTR) opened in Aurangabad district recently,” he said.
 
 The state’s first national-level driving school (IDTR) was inaugurated by CM   on May 3. The institute has been set up with funds to the tune of Rs25 crore on 15 acre land. It is also being run on PPP mode by  , which looks after its day-to-day maintenance.
 
 As per the central government’s scheme for setting up driving training centres (DTCs), the driving institutes must have two classrooms with teaching aids like computers and projectors, simulator(s) for both heavy and light vehicles, broadband connectivity, including biometric attendance system, driving track for maneuvering, parking, reverse driving, driving on slopes, training as well as two light and heavy vehicles with dual control.
 
 In view of the urgent need to meet the shortage of trained commercial drivers, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017 has provided for the establishment of accredited driving training schools, which are to be licensed by the state governments.
