Tirupur: Suyamariyadhai Samathuva Kazhagam has raised an objection to government higher secondary school at   near   using a goddess’ image in a flex banner placed in front of the school. It also alleged that the school has used ‘non-secular’ wordings in an official invitation.

 In the flex banner inviting villagers for an alumni meet is the image of goddess Saraswati. In the official invitation, the administration has used a phrase ‘Ellam valla iraivan perarulal’ (with god’s blessings).
 
 “It is basic for a government educational institution to be secular, but the school failed to do so,” said A Pandian of Suyamariyadhai Samathuva Kazhagam. Pandian has submitted a petition to the school headmaster   regarding this.
 
  The school administration is preparing to conduct an alumni meet for students studied between 1966 and 2016, on January 13.
