MANGALURU:   took almost one year to file a chargesheet against 30 members of the Sri Rama Sene, accused of attacking women guests at Amnesia Pub on January 24, 2009.

 This was due to a legal requirement which mandates them to seek permission of the state government before filing a chargesheet to the court when certain sections of the Indian Penal Code are invoked against the accused, police officials had said.
 
  
 
 For one of the 11 sections of the IPC applied – 505 (2) — government permission was required before a chargesheet could be filed before the court. Some sections where the police have to approach the government are 153 A and 295 A.
 
 Amnesia was a popular watering hole for the youth. It was renamed Amigo, among its many names, later. It came under the saffron lens for allegedly promoting ‘immorality’ on its premises. The SRS cadres took matters into their hands, in what its leadership then avowed was an attempt to protect “their sisters who are going astray”.
 
 Former Union minister   Chowdhury was also dragged into the case as she stated the place had been talibanised. Police had filed a B Report. A criminal case was filed against Renuka on February 16, 2009 by a group of people including then Mangaluru mayor Ganesh Hosabettu. The complaint said Renuka had cast aspersions on people of Mangaluru.
