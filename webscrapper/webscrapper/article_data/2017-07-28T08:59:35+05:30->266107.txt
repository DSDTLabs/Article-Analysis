GUWAHATI: As the state recovers from the ravages of the flood, those affected by the deluge have appealed for immediate redress from the state and the Centre. 

 "We have lost everything to floods. Our cattle have been washed away. We are small farmers. How do we make up for the losses? We appeal to the state and the Centre to help us so that we can lead a normal life again," said  , a Lakhimpur-based farmer.
  
  
 As on Thursday, 9,988 people across six districts are affected by floods. Several areas in  ,  ,  , Jorhat,   and Karimganj districts continue to be inundated. A total of 2,300 people are taking shelter in 12 relief camps across four districts - Nagaon, Lakhimpur,   and Sivasagar. So far, 79 people have died in the first spell of floods.
  
  
 Meanwhile, the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) staged a demonstration seeking relief and rehabilitation for the victims. The influential farmers' body also raised a voice against the construction of dams. "Rehabilitation works are not up to the mark in flood-affected areas. We want the government to speed up the process," said a KMSS leader in Lakhimpur on Thursday. 
 
 This year, more than 2 lakh hectares of agriculture land have been damaged by the flood water in 29 districts.
