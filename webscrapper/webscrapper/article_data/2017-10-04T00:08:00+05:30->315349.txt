 Bengaluru: From tyres coming off running buses to the chief minister being forced to cut short his inspection of rain-affected areas on rickety buses, the BMTC has been making headlines for all wrong reasons in the recent past.
 
 Though the state-owned corporation has suspended more than five employees responsible for these incidents, it continues to operate overaged buses. According to norms, buses need to be scrapped once it reaches 8.5 lakh km or 10 years, whichever is earlier.
 
 The corporation has 6,391 buses (5,554 non-AC and 837 AC). BMTC records show 1,390 buses (1,342 non-AC and 48 AC) are more than 10 years old as on July this year. Nine buses operating in the existing fleet are over 14 years. While 1,215 buses have exceeded the permissible limit of 8 lakh km. Of this, 119 have reached over 10 lakh km.
 
 Senior BMTC officials say they are forced to operate old buses as there’re no new buses added to the fleet during 2015 and 2016 due of various reasons. “We have started inducting new buses in a phased manner. Of the planned 1,950 new buses, nearly 750 have been added so far. We are scrapping the overaged buses depending on the induction of new ones. All old buses will be phased out by the end of this year,” they said.
 
 KSRTC Staff and Workers Federation general secretary Ananth Subbarao said the BMTC is making employees scapegoats. “The condition of buses has turned from bad to worse. But the BMTC is acting against employees to hide its mistakes. There’s also severe shortage of mechanical staff and spare parts especially for Volvo buses which resulted in rise in cancellation of schedules,” he added.
 
 Activists say strengthening the public transport system is the need of the hour. “BMTC should ensure safety and comfort of buses so it can attract more people towards public transport. The government should consider public transport as a priority and provide adequate financial assistance to expand its fleets,” said Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of Citizens for Bengaluru, an NGO.
 
 Experts say delay in scrapping of buses leads to frequent breakdowns, heavy pollution and increased maintenance cost. The recent CAG report also found that operation of overaged buses resulted in increased operational costs. For instance, the amount spent on auto spare parts increased from Rs 32.15 crore in 2011-12 to Rs 64.20 crore in 2015 and on lubricant consumption Rs 8.63 crore in 2011-12 to Rs 13.09 crore in 2015-16 and recondition of vehicles Rs 13.31 crore in 2011-12 to Rs 18.22 crore in 2015-16. Between 2011 and 2016, the schedule for a total of 153.88 lakh km was cancelled due to non-availability of buses, the report stated.
