BENGALURU: It’s been eight years since   (BU) created history by becoming the first in the country to reserve seats for   in each of its 47 postgraduate courses, yet not a single seat has been filled. Reason: The university hasn’t received a single application till date.

 The university had introduced a transgender category apart from the male and female options in 2010. This move came seven years before the state government decided to provide mandatory reservation for transgenders and sexual minorities in all levels of formal education across Karnataka.
 
 B K Ravi, registrar (administration), Bangalore University, confirmed they haven’t received any application. 
 
 Professors at the university attribute this to transgenders either dropping out at the school level or being too poor to afford undergraduate education. They could also be afraid of being singled out on campus or feel they may not get a job on graduation, and the course might end up being a waste.
 
 “Most transpersons drop out of school by the time they reach Class IX or X. Many such students face abuse from others, and teachers may not be very supportive either. Many start questioning their gender by the time they reach 13 or 14 years, which is why we have urged policymakers to introduce a course in Class VIII on gender and sexuality, so that they can be educated on the issue,” said Nisha Gulur of Sangama, an organisation working for the rights of sexual minorities.
 
  In 2012-13, Shivani V, now 28, tried applying for a reserved seat in LLB course. “When I went to submit my application, I was told reservation was only for postgraduate students. What’s the point of reserving seats at such a high level if most trans-students don’t even reach their first year of college? It would have been more effective if the seats were offered at the undergraduate level,” she said, adding that she eventually got admission in another university.
