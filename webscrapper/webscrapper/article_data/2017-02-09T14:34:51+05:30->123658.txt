 This wildlife and environment film festival is being organised in the city for the first time. It is the rich wildlife around Nagpur that has motivated the organisers to plan the event. Festival director Aditya Mukherjee says, “It is amazing to see that Nagpur is so well-connected with the wildlife around it. Jungles in and around the city boast of many popular tigers, so we decided to celebrate this fact through the film fest.”
 
 
 The films from 20 countries, including Austria, United Kingdom, America, Spain etc. will be screened at the fest. Livelihood expert (Pench Foundation)   says, “Forty short films, feature films, documentaries and animation films will be screened at the fest. These are all award-winning films and documentaries from across the globe. The entry is free, so that we can attract a lot of young wildlife enthusiasts, especially the college students. It is our endeavour to sensitise the youngsters towards their environment and give them a sneak peek into the vibrant and beautiful wildlife through an entertaining medium.”
 
 Along with award-winning documentaries, on the concluding day, world premeire of a   film is also being organised. Without divulging the details, festival director says, “It is an international documentary on wolves and it has never been shown anywhere in the world. The film will be shown for the first time in Nagpur and I’m sure it will be a wonderful experience for all.”
