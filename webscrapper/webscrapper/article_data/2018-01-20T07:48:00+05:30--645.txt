 Munish Kapoor, secretary of   committee office, said, “As many as 600 candidates have shown interest in fighting MC elections. The forms will be scrutinized and the list of those candidates whose forms are valid will be displayed by Tuesday.”
 
 Importantly, submission of such high number of forms for 95 wards can become a headache for the party. Sources said going by numbers of applications, party has got 5 ticket seekers from each ward on an average and it will be tough task for the party to contain the resentment and rebellion which is likely to ensue after the tickets are distributed.
 
 District Congress chief  , said, “There is no question of any rebellion or resentment as our workers are disciplined and always follow high command’s decision. In fact, we are going to register thumping victory in Ludhiana MC elections and I am hopeful that we will win all the seats.”
