GUWAHATI: The Assam chapter of All India People's Science Network (AIPSN) will lend its support to the Global March for Science which will be organized as a protest against 'attacks' being launched on science and rational discourses across the world. While the march will be held on April 14 across the world, in Assam it will be held on April 11 because of the Bihu celebrations. 

 The march will be organized in the state to express solidarity with the global action, said AIPSN national joint secretary   on Wednesday. On the occasion, a meeting followed by a mass procession will be organized at Lakshiram Baruah Sadan here in the city.
 
 "We appeal to all science-loving people to join us for expressing solidarity with the Global March for Science. Attacks on science and reason, and spreading obscurantist values through the use of public institutions must stop," Rahman said.
 
 In Assam, members of the institutions affiliated to AIPSN - such as  , Ellora Vigyan Mancha, Gyan-Vigyan Samiti-Assam and Commercial Representatives Union (northeast region) - will throng the streets to demand for a conducive atmosphere for promoting the scientific temperament.
 
 "In India, attacks on science have come in the form of assassination of rationalists and journalists including Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, professor MM   and the journalist Gauri Lankesh. The AIPSN believes that the scientific community, and all people who have faith in science and reason, must together resist these attacks," Rahman added.
 
 The AIPSN in a statement said it sees a pattern in these attacks on science and reason across the world. "US President  's denial of climate change and current Union minister's rejection of evolution are some of the prime examples," the statement added.
