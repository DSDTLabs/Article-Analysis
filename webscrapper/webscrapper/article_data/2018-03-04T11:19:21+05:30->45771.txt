MYSURU:  , cobbled with the adverse impact of climate change on the vegetation, had jeopardised the survival of  , rued deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) V Yedukondalu on Saturday.

 Yedukondalu, who was at Aranya Bhavan where the World Wildlife Day celebrations were held on Saturday, pointed to the increase in the incidence of sighting of leopard in   as a symptom of the malaise. “There have been multiple incidents of leopards straying into areas near  , which is because of the stress on their natural habitat,” he said.
 
 Yedukondalu said that water scarcity during summer, coupled with the reduction in the population of prey for the predatory big cats, has resulted in the big cats leaving the forests and entering human habitats. “This is the consequence of change in the crop pattern in areas contiguous to the forests. The availability of water, coupled with easy prey, tempts leopards into straying into these farms. This has, in turn, led to a spurt in the population of feral dogs and pigs,” said Yedukondalu.
 
 Appealing to the public to co-exist with the leopards, Yedukondalu said, “Public must cooperate with the forest department not to help us capture leopards. These big cats do not harm humans.”
 
 Assistant principal chief conservator of forests (project tiger) Jagat Ram said that conservation of tigers would go a long way in ensuring the protection of other species.
 
 Ram released the brochure, ‘Leopard – A cat among man’ prepared by the   forest department. Meanwhile, three short movies ‘Sleeping Leopard’, ‘Forest Fire’ and ‘Tiger and Kali’ were screened as part of the celebrations. Ram also distributed prizes for the winners of photography and poster contest held by the department.
 
 Deputy conservator of forests KT Hanumanthappa, chief conservator of forests, Mysuru circle PB Karunakara and executive director of the Mysuru Zoo C Ravishankar were present.
