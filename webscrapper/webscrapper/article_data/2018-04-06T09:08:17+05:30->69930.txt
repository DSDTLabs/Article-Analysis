AHMEDABAD: In the case of the suspected lion show using live bait, the video of which went viral on social media recently, forest officers have zeroed in on one   Garana. He is the son of a former forest range officer. However, before his arrest could be made,   apparently had an epileptic fit and was hospitalized.

 Chief conservator of forest, A P  , said, “Sohil’s cellphone was full of videos and photographs of illegal lion shows.”
 
 “During investigation, we found Sohil was involved and also found the original video that had gone viral,” said Singh, adding, “We have deployed forest officials and police to ensure that Sohil does not escape from the hospital.”
 
 Singh said that once Sohil was arrested, the department will be able to learn where the video had been shot and about others who were involved in the lion show.
 
 A video showing three lionesses killing a cow used as live bait had gone viral on social media recently. There had been reports of people living near Gir Sanctuary holding illegal lions shows for a fee of Rs 5,000-10,000. But, this is the first time that a video showing the use of live bait has emerged.
 
 Officials involved in the investigation said the landscape seen in the video seems to indicate that the video was shot in the Girnar Sanctuary area. 
 
 The video shows a cow tied to a tree and three lionesses approaching from different sides. The cow is attacked and dragged towards a forested area. A local person, who tries to speak Hindi but uses Gujarati words, can be heard speaking in the video. He says, “Don’t go close, or she will take the bait away.” The effort to speak Hindi indicates it could be the video of a live-bait show organized for a visitor, who does not understand Gujarati.
