NEW DELHI: A court has issued a notice to   after AAP   Prakash  , who is one of the accused in the Delhi   Anshu Prakash   case, moved an application seeking court-monitored investigation into the matter. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal on Thursday issued the notice seeking the police’s reply by June 27.

 In his application, filed through advocates B S Joon and Mohd Irshad, the MLA alleged that the investigating agency, particularly the Additional DCP, Harinder Singh, was acting under the influence of the complainant (chief secretary) and the Delhi lieutenant governor with whom a power-sharing struggle had been going on for the past three years with respect to which a litigation was pending before the SC.
 
 The application said that an “unfair and bias attitude” of the police was reflected in the investigation of the assault on Delhi minister Imran Hussain by some Delhi Secretariat employees on the alleged instigation of the CS.
