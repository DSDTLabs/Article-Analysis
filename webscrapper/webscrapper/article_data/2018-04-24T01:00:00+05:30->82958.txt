Back in the 1990s, appointment viewing on a Hindi TV channel meant tuning into ' ' every Friday evening. Starting from 1993, the show had 15 seasons and it has been hosted by many popular actors, including Annu Kapoor, Pallavi Joshi, Durga Jasraj, Rajeshwari Sachdev, Renuka Shahane and  . And now, BT has it that the show, which is producer Gajendra Singh’s brainchild, is gearing up for a comeback, but with a modern facelift. The idea is to involve every viewer across the country with the help of digital technology. 

 At this point, there is no clarity on which channel will air the show. However, it is expected to go on floors in the next two months. Buzz is that the show will have younger faces as hosts, who can connect better with the youth. There are talks that actor-comedian   and TV actress  , among others, have been approached to anchor it, but there has been no confirmation of the same.
 
 The original show had three teams — Deewane, Parwane and Mastane — and rounds like Prelude, Dhun and Remix, which tested the contestants’ knowledge of Hindi film music. For the new version of 'Antakshari', nostalgia will be the underlying theme, but the makers will throw in other rounds that will appeal to the current generation. 
 
 BT reached out to  , but there was no response till we went to press.
