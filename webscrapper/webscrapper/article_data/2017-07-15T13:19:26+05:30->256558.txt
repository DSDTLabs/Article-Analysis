NAGPUR: In order to honour the warrior king Shivaji, Mahametro has decided to model the   station on Raigad fort. Shivaji had constructed the fort, situated in Konkan region, and made it his capital in 1674AD.

 Mahametro spokesperson said that the Chhatrapati Nagar flyover, which was razed last year, was named after the warrior king and hence the Metro station near it was being modelled on Raigad fort. A new double-decker flyover is being built in place of the demolished flyover. “The station will be a place of attraction for the city. It will greatly add to the beauty of the new flyover,” the spokesperson added.
 
 Mahametro is building most of the Metro stations on some theme. The Institution of Engineers station on North Ambazari Road will be built on ‘Aqua theme’. The Metro stretch from Sitabuldi interchange station to Lokmanya Nagar station ( ) has been named as blue line as a large section is along the Nag River. Mahametro managing director   therefore took the decision to go in for Aqua theme.
 
 The Kasturchand Park station will also be designed like a fort. Its roof will be made of glass and sky will be visible from the station. It will gel with the surroundings containing iconic buildings of the city like Vidhan Bhavan, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Sitabuldi Fort, etc
 
 The Rahate Colony station will be built on green theme and will be surrounded by large number of trees. The Ujjwal Nagar station will be built on ‘Tiger theme’ as Nagpur is the Tiger Capital of the country.
