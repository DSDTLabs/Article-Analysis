Defending champion   celebrated his 32nd birthday on Sunday making short work of   ( 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 ) in his third-round match, and then made a ball boy’s day at the  . 

 
 
 
 One of the most endearing traits of Nadal and his peers Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have been their associations with their fans and little things that they do fulfil their dreams and make their day. 
 
 This year was also no different, as Nadal, fresh from his victory against Gasquet, played ball with one of the ball boys. When being interviewed post-match by none other than 2013 Wimbledon champion  , the 33-year-old asked Nadal if he could fulfill the a ball boy’s dream of playing against him and without hesitation Nadal reached out in his bag and handed the stunned ball boy a racquet and then proceeded to play. 
 
 After a brief rally of handful of forehands, the ball boy seemed to have had enough of it, but Nadal insisted on playing another point and this time the ball boy brought out his double-handed backhands. Nadal obliged the kid and well ,safe to say, made the boy’s dream come true.
