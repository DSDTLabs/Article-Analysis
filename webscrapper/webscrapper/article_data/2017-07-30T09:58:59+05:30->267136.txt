AHMEDABAD: The drivers of a locomotive and a train, coming from opposite directions, were forced to make unscheduled stops near the   railway crossing, at about 5.20pm on Saturday, because road traffic on the level crossing would not clear the track, despite several requests and warnings by the railway staff manning the crossing. The train and the engine could move only after about 15 minutes, when the crossing was finally forced shut.

 Railway officials said the   doesn’t have a stop at the Maninagar railway station. However, the train did not get a green signal because traffic at the crossing was backed up to Swaminarayan Temple at one end and the Maninagar underpass at the other. While one lane of the crossing was closed, motorists kept squeezing in to pass, despite warnings. A railway engine from   was also forced to stop a few feet from the crossing.
 
 Harshad Patel, a social worker from Amraiwadi, said the bad road conditions and evening rush caused the blockage. “Several representations have been made to ease traffic but none have worked so far,” he said.
