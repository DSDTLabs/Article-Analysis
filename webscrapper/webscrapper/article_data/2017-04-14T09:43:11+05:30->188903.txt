Shimla: BJP leaders from   including Union health minister J P Nadda, Kangra MP Shanta Kumar and Shimla MP   held a special meeting with Union minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha in Delhi on Wednesday to give aviation a fillip in the hill state. Nadda said that since Himachal Pradesh is a major tourist destination with lots of foreign thronging all round the year, it is critical to have a robust air connectivity.

 Nadda mentioned that adequate connectivity and affordable airfare are two important issues confronting aviation sectors’ effectiveness in Himachal. He said innovative and novel scheme of UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is going to improve connectivity considerably in the state. 
 
 “Unused airport of Shimla (JubbarHatti) and under used airport of Kullu and Dharamshala are going to get additional low fare flights in the near future from Delhi,” Nadda added. According to him, Jayant Sinha has informed that the Government of India is planning to build about 300 new small airports to improve domestic connectivity of uncapped areas and the aviation ministry is planning to construct new airports as well as augment the capacity of existing airports of the state. 
 
 In the meeting, MPs from Himachal also raised long pending issue of extension of Dharamshala (Gaggal) and Kullu (Bhuntar) airports, so as to facilitate regular flights of ATR-72 type aircraft without payload penalty to these airports. They also discussed the issue of night landing facility at the   airport.
 
 Nadda said it is also decided to explore new location in Mandi, Shimla, Lahaul Spitit and other districts for construction of airfields. “It is the concerted efforts of the BJP-led Central government to add and improve the road, rail and air infrastructure in tourist intensive hill state so that it can emerge as one of the best tourist destination at world-level and increase avenues for business and employment in this sector,” he added.
