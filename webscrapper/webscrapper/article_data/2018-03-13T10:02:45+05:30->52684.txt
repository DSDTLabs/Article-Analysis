ALAPPUZHA: Though the BJP is making all efforts to capture the   assembly seat through every possible means, the apparent rift in NDA may affect the poll prospects of the party. The Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) leader Thushar   and Sree Narayana Dharama Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary   have come out openly against the BJP on Monday and they warned that the party could not win the Chengannur seat without their support.

 
 BDJS president   said that the state meeting of BDJS leaders scheduled to be held in Cherthala on Wednesday would take a final decision on their stand on Chengannur bypoll. The meeting would also take a decision on the party’s tie-up with the NDA. At present, the BDJS is keeping away from the election works of the BJP in Chengannur.
 
 
 Thushar Vellappally said the NDA, the LDF and the UDF had chances to win from Chengannur. But the BJP could not win without the support of the BDJS, he added.
 
 
 Though there were speculations that a   seat would be given to BDJS, the BJP decided to field its national council member and former state president V Muraleedharan from Maharashtra.
 
 
 Thushar Vellappally said that the news about his Rajya Sabha candidature was fake. “We have never demanded an MP post from the NDA and they never promised one,” he said but added that the party had demanded 14 posts in companies and corporations under NDA government.
 
 
 “But they did not accept our demand. The state leadership of the BJP is not giving any consideration to its allies,” he said. He also alleged that the BJP in the state was trying to conduct all the programmes and agitations of NDA by themselves but failed to make them a success.
