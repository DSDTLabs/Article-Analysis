SHIMLA: A committee would be set up to conduct a study on zero budget natural farming and to submit a detailed report on it,   governor Acharya Devvrat said on Tuesday while presiding over a meeting with senior scientists of Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Agriculture  , Palampur, in Kangra district.

 He said the recommendations of the committee would be followed to make Himachal a natural farming state in the next four years. Appreciating the efforts of university scientists in the field of natural farming, he requested them to take a lead in making Himachal a natural farming state after Sikkim.
 
 “As far as chemical farming is concerned, the products so produced are harmful and poisonous and is also costly,” he said. He said that cost of production in organic farming is high and it absorbs more essential nutrients from soil, therefore, zero budget natural farming is the best alternative for farming.
 
 University vice-chancellor Prof   said already 25 acre land has been identified for natural farming.
