Surat: Textile goods transporters who deliver fabrics, saris and dress material from the city to traders in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, have unanimously decided not to transport goods without form 402 and e-way bill of the sender and receiver from Wednesday. 

 A decision to this effect was taken by Surat Textile Goods Transporters’ Association (STGTA) at a meeting held here on Tuesday. STGTA office-bearers stated that Uttar Pradesh and Bihar governments have issued a circular stating that the goods coming from other states without form 402 and e-way bill will not be allowed to enter and that the transporters will have to pay penalty and face jail term under Goods and Services Tax laws. 
 
 STGTA president Yuvraj Deshle said, “There are many traders who are not conforming to GST laws. Ultimately, the transporters will be held responsible and end up paying penalty and facing jail term. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar governments will become strict from Wednesday. Thus, the transporters have decided not to transport the goods without e-way bill and form 402.” Around 700 trucks are loaded with goods on a daily basis and head to various destinations from here across the country. The daily supply of polyester fabrics, saris and dress material from the city is pegged at Rs 125 crore.
