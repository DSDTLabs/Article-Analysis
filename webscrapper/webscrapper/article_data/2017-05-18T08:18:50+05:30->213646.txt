NEW DELHI: Life just became more difficult for former ministers, MPs and   who have overstayed their welcome in government accommodation. The   on Wednesday approved squeezing the time period for completing their   process to only three days against the present 60 days. Moreover, the overstaying allottees can now only approach high courts to get relief.

 At present, persons overstaying can approach lower courts where it’s easy to get stay orders. TOI in November had first reported the urban development ministry had moved this proposal seeking Cabinet approval. The urban development ministry has already hiked the penalty for overstaying in government accommodation, which is almost equivalent to market rent.
 
 Annually, about 7,000-8,000 government houses get vacated in Delhi and in 20-25% cases the allottees continue to occupy them. Sources said nearly 200 allottees approach lower courts to get stay orders every year. The current lengthy process not only costs the exchequer in terms of pursuing court cases but also increases waiting time for those entitled to get official accommodation.
 
 At present, about 70 officials are overstaying for more than two years after challenging eviction orders in different courts. Among them Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh who has kept his accommodation for more than two years now after having approached a lower court in Delhi.
 
 According to an official release, Cabinet has approved amendments in Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act by inserting definition of “residential accommodation occupation”.
 
 It said, “The Amendment will enable the estate officer to apply summary proceedings for evicting unauthorised occupants from residential accommodations allotted for a fixed tenure or for a period he/she holds office on the basis of an order of allotment on licence basis, as non-vacation of such residences leads to unavailability of houses to new incumbents.”
