BENGALURU: It's been a rough six months for firms that are responsible for management of ATMs of various banks across the state. Banks outsource overall management of ATMs to these firms, from transport of cash to security at kiosks. However, profits of these firms is contingent on the number of transactions at ATMs, and with supply of cash drying up after demonetization, their business has nosedived.

 With the Centre intent on making a swift transition to a digital economy, cash supply to ATMs has decreased by 80%.“We've incurred losses of up to Rs 15 crore in the last four months in the state. If the situation does not improve, our business could become unviable,“ said Rajaram R, project manager of  , which manages ATMs for   and CICI Bank among others.
 
 In January and February, ash supply to ATMs nearly normalized, before taking a urn for the worse in March. There are around eight major companies that manage ATMs in the state, and nearly all of them are staring at an uncertain future. “Our revenue depends solely on the number of transactions at ATMs,“ said  , a senior official from Writers Safe Guard.
 
 Echoing Manjunath's observations, V  , senior manager of  , said, “ATMs near Majestic registered 12,000 transactions a month. But, post-demonetisation, the number has dipped to 200,“ he said.
 
 He pointed out that the revenue from handling the kiosks did not even cover the company's expenses. Owing to the agencies' contractual obligations to the banks, many of these firms, which wish to shut down ATMs, are unable to do so immediately.
 
 “I don't think all ATMs will disappear at once. A few of them will still see business since customers would still visit kiosks for non-financial transactions,“ said MM Chiniwar, chief general manager (Bengaluru circle), Canara Bank.
