In   and  , a mere 1,700 patients were reported by private hospitals during that year, said experts during an awareness programme held at a city hospital on Friday, on the eve of World Tuberculosis Day.

 Healthcare professionals said TB continues to be the top infectious killer worldwide, claiming over 4,500 lives a day. They also shared how over a million cases went missing from the national notification system. This poses a grave threat to the efforts being made to end TB by 2035, as per the World Health Organization’s (WHO) ‘End TB strategy’. “While TB was earlier easily treatable and was not known for morbidity and mortality, today it has taken a form where we have to collaborate and eradicate TB. The medical community should make sure they report TB where ever they see it. Unless it is reported we can’t handle it the way we want,” said Dr Hari Prasad, president, hospitals division, Apollo Hospitals. The event was jointly organised by the   (RNTCP) of Telangana and Apollo.

The state is also actively pursuing effective implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act and Schedule H1 reporting for improving private sector TB notifications,” said Dr  , joint director (TB) of the state health department.
