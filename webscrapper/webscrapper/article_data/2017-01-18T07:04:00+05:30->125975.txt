 The items included a revolver, ammunition, cobbler’s knife and diaries. It has also been requested that the existing policy of UK government, according to which “weapons or other items used as evidence in crime of such nature are not returned”, may be appropriately reviewed if necessary.
 
 Jain also said the   would continue to explore all ways and means to resolve the matter with the UK government. After recording the statement of the additional solicitor general, the division bench headed by Justice S S Saron disposed of the petition.
 
 The matter was pending before the HC in the wake of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate HC Arora and Banur resident Karanvir Shenty Thamman, seeking directions to Punjab government and the ministry of external affairs, New Delhi, to bring back the belongings of Udham Singh from metropolitan police, London.
 
 Petitioners had argued that even if those belongings were case property, the government of India should make efforts to get those belongings on “sapurdari” basis.
