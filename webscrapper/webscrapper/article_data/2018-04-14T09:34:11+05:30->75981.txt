LUCKNOW: Amid speculation of his arrest over the past two days, a team of   finally detained   MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the wee hours of Friday from his friend's house in   and took him to its office on   in Hazratganj. 

 CBI sleuths grilled the rape accused MLA for over 16 hours. The interrogation was on around 8.30pm when the last reports came in, according to sources. 
 
 The 20-member CBI team had 21 questions for the disgraced MLA about the alleged incident of the gang rape of a minor in Unnao and the death of her father in police custody. 
 
 Sources told TOI that the questions pertained to Sengar's location during the incident, the location of his brother Atul and his aide Mahesh during the incident, the voice of the person in the audio, how he came in contact with the members of the survivor's family and if Sengar had called up the police station after a case was registered.
 
 Meanwhile, another CBI team visited Makhi police station and interrogated the survivors' family. The team also suspended police officials and doctors who had performed the autopsy on the survivor's father.
 
 The other questions the CBI team posed to Sengar were about a detailed account of the incidents since June 2017, the veracity of the audio tape in which he is reportedly talking to the survivor's uncle, whether the survivor had visited his home, his acquaintance with Shashi Singh-the woman who had reportedly lured the girl to Sengar's house-and how often they interacted.
 
 Sengar was also asked the exact cause of enmity between the survivor's family and his, if any. 
 
  He was asked why he went to the SSP Lucknow's residence on Wednesday night and who all had met him since his name was shown as an accused in the episode.
