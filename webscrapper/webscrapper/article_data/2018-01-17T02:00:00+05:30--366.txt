PATNA: The state government on Tuesday told the Patna high   that participation of students above Class V and teachers in human chain formation against dowry and child marriage on January 21 was not compulsory.

 “The activity is voluntary in nature,” advocate general Lalit Kishore, who appeared before the division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay on behalf of the state government, said, adding the state chief secretary had already issued a circular on January 8, stating that children up to Class V were not required to participate in the event.
 
 A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the high court by one Shiv Prakash Rai, challenging the January 11 notification of the education department which asked students and teachers to participate in the human chain formation. All middle, secondary and higher secondary schools were asked to remain open on the day. The government had also asked schools to serve midday meal to the students on January 21.
 
 The petitioner's counsel submitted during the hearing that it was misuse of public money on human chain and children should not be involved in it at all as many kids were taken ill during last year’s campaign against liquor. Besides, citing the apex court ruling, the petitioner contended that teachers should not be engaged in non-academic activities except duties of national importance such as election and census count.
 
 On this, the court said it was not disposing of the petition and listed the matter for hearing after four weeks.
