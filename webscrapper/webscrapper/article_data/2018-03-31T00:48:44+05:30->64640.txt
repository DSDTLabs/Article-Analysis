New Delhi: Union housing and urban development minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday took a dig at the Delhi government saying the AAP government is “suffering from commitment and decision-making phobia” and is playing “political football”.

 Puri also said one thing that the sealing drive in Delhi will hold people responsible for encroachment on government land and illegal construction. He added that the change in the master plan would put things in order.
 
 The minister said that during his review meetings on urban schemes, he has found that the Delhi government has spent little of the funds sanctioned to it for different programmes. The minister highlighted the case of DMRC phase-IV proposal, which has been pending before the Delhi government.
 
 He said that while Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had assured him to send the proposal six months ago, there was still no progress. “Recently, one of his ministers said they were carrying out audit of some corridors. They are not taking decision. We have decided that if Delhi is held to ransom by the AAP government, we at the Centre will go ahead because people of Delhi deserve better,” Puri said.
 
 Speaking at India Economic Conclave, Puri said, “They (AAP government) are yet to make up their mind about where they stand vis-a-vis Delhi.” Delhi, at present, is a severe case of multiplicity and multi-layered authority, he said, adding that in 2014 when NDA came to power at Centre, Delhi elected AAP to govern the capital city.
