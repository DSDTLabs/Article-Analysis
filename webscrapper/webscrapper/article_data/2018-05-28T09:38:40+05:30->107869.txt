CHENNAI: When a resident of the   near Padappai died waiting for an ambulance earlier this month, it threw the spotlight on the lack of basic amenities at   sites, including adequate healthcare.

 
 Valli, 25, a resident of the tenements, was among those who staged a road roko on the Vandalur-Oragadam-Walajabad Road following the death of 50-year-old Mani. “He complained of chest pain at 5am when an ambulance was called. But it only arrived at 6.30am,” she lamented.
 
 While on paper, the   (TNSCB) has provisions for a primary health centre (PHC) at these sites, the one here has never been visited by a doctor. A health worker comes once a week to administer medicines to menstruating and lactating women.
 
 The situation is worse at the Perumbakkam settlement, which has over 20,000 housing units, where there is no PHC, with residents expected to visit the centre at the Semmenchery settlement. “When they are moving thousands of people to this settlement each year, shouldn’t facilities be adequately improved?” asked Vanessa Peter, a policy researcher with Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities.
 
 When a TNSCB official was contacted, she was unaware of the death in the   tenements. She said the onus of construction falls on the TNSCB but the local administration has been requested many times to ensure the provision of facilities like functional PHCs, besides operational fair price shops, teachers for schools and police booths. “It will not be possible to provide an ambulance at each settlement but we will work with the local administration to ensure that services are improved,” she said.
 
 The MD of TNSCB, Shambu Kallolikar, was not available for comment despite several attempts to reach him.
