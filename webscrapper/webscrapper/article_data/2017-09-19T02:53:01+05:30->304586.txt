NEW DELHI: Do you ever drive at more than 25 kmph or more than the specified speed limit while passing by a school or a hospital or a construction site? 

 Do you play loud music while driving or watch videos except for navigation? Do you skip stopping at pedestrian crossings or drive on footpath or do you use an air horn or multi-toned horn? If yes, then be prepared to be pulled over by traffic cops and being slapped with a heavy fine. 
 
 The road transport ministry has notified detailed regulations for drivers, which include dozens of dos and donâ€™ts. Violation of these norms notified under the   is an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act. Though the normal penalty is just Rs 100 as of now, traffic police can impose higher fine and can even confiscate the licence if they find that such an act could pose danger to others on the road. 
 
 The penalties will be more than five-fold once the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill is passed. This is the first time that the ministry has notified a comprehensive handbook for drivers about their responsibilities, lane driving and the right of way. 
 
 Keeping in mind the growing numbers of two-wheelers, the regulations allow motorcyclists to pass between three and four-wheeled vehicles only when the speed difference between the motorcyclist and the other vehicles is less than 15 kmph and the maximum speed limit is 40 kmph. This means two-wheelers should not change lanes on stretches where the speed is higher.
