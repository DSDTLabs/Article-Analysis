GURUGRAM: Even cops are not spared by fraudsters. Cyber thieves allegedly cloned a city cop’s   and withdrew around Rs 2.65 lakh from his bank account over a period of five months without the policeman getting a whiff of it.

 Darshan Singh, who is a head constable and works in the reader branch of the police commissioner’s office in Gurugram, approached the Sector 14 police station in January as most of the transactions took place in areas under their jurisdiction. 
 
 According to police, a total of Rs 2.65 lakh — which constituted Singh’s savings — was withdrawn from his salary account between September 2017 and January 2018. The complainant told cops that he found out about the   in January when he received a withdrawal message on his phone. He was in for a shock as he hadn’t carried out the transaction and his ATM card was lying right in front of him. 
 
 As he approached the bank, an executive informed him about his balance, which was near negligible. Upon further enquiry, the executive told him that the transactions from his account had been been carried out since September 2017.
 
 Singh told cops that since September he had not received a single ATM cash withdrawal message and as he rarely visited the bank as he was clueless about the transactions. 
 
 Following preliminary investigations, an FIR was registered on Saturday under sections 379 (theft) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC against the unidentified accused. 
 
 Asked about the delay in the case,   said, “Details of all the transactions are still awaited. We can’t go ahead with the probe till we get the exact details. We can procure CCTV footage from the ATMs only after knowing the locations from where the withdrawals were done.” The SHO further said sections under the IT Act would be added to the FIR if investigations reveal that the account was hacked.
