LUCKNOW: The  ,  , around   crossing led to a   on Wednesday.   as roads from Nishatganj to Mahanagar and Indiranagar remained choked.

 The ongoing Metro construction near Badshahnagar Crossing added to the problem as ripple-effect was seen on the Faizabad Road, Chhanilal Crossing and Kapoorthala.
 
 While Buddh Bazaar results in jams around Gole Market every week, it turned more chaotic this Wednesday. As no extra policemen were deployed to manage the traffic, commuters had to find the way on their own through the maze.
 
 Sakshi Bhargava, a school teacher, was agitated. “We face this every Wednesday. The administration should at least deploy more cops here when the bazaar is held. Incidents of chain and purse-snatchings also take place in the weekly bazaar,” she said. Ashok Rajput, who got stuck for several hours near the Wireless crossing in Mahanagar, said, “Half of the road was encroached by vendors and then people had haphazardly parked their vehicles, leaving hardly any space for vehicles. on the road thinning the area for the movement of traffic.”
 
 Anjali Vaish of Alambagh, who had come to visit her relative at a nursing home near to Gole market, too got stuck in the jam. “How can the administration allow the weekly market near a hospital. The entire road gets blocked,” said Vaish. Shekhar Verma, a student, said, “I have to go to Hazratganj for evening classes and autos from Gole market charge extra fare whenever there is a jam.”
 
 While the jams started around 10.30am, the situation worsened during peak hours in the evening.
 
 Circle officer (traffic) Rajesh Tewari said the footfall at Buddh Bazaar on Wednesday was unusually higher as compared to every week. This resulted in bottlenecks. “We deployed more cops to ease the flow of traffic,” he said.
