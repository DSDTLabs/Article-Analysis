Chennai: Eyeing that dream cruiser bike but can’t seem to be able to cough up over Rs 7 lakh for it? ‘Go for a used version instead’ seems to be the motto of India’s growing band of bike enthusiasts. As leisure biking picks up speed in India, two segments are revving up a storm — home-made heritage bike Royal Enfield and pre-used superbikes. According to online marketplaces like Droom and OLX, the used superbike segment is the fastest growing niche in the used two wheeler space, growing at four times the pace of new superbikes. In value terms, the used superbike sales now comprise 25% of the used two-wheeler market as young enthusiasts use the organised online route to buy their dream machine. Given that 2.5 year old models of a popular superbike like the Harley Street 750 or Iron 883 or a KTM Duke for example are available at a 40% discount, is reason enough for biking enthusiasts to go for them .

 “The average ticket size of a pre-used super bike is Rs 5,66,333 which is a good 40% cheaper than a new machine and therefore a much better deal in the used market compared to the more popular mass market vehicles, that cost anywhere between 32-39,000 for scooters and motorbikes respectively. A KTM or Harley Davidson can be had at a price 40% cheaper, the cost of which is comparable with luxury cars. That’s also why new super bikes are growing at only 12% compared to 40% growth in used super bikes,” said Sandeep Aggarwal, founder and CEO, Droom.
 
 Part of the reason for their allure is the ticket price of new super bikes. A new Suzuki Hayabusa can cost upwards of Rs 15 lakh while a Harley Iron 883 comes for just under Rs 8 lakh. “They are more expensive than 80% of new cars available in India,” said Aggarwal. As a result, the young and aspirational bikers are turning online for the machine of their choice. That trend is showing itself up not only in online sales but also in turnaround time and listings on portals like OLX.
 
 “Although India is a commuter bikes dominant market, an interesting trend that we have observed is that of premium and luxury segments showing an uptake. On OLX bikes across categories covering -Mileage, Premium and Luxury segments are listed everyday . On an average 55%, 35%, and 10% listings are from ‘Mileage’ (less than 150 CC), ‘Premium’ (150-250CC) and ‘Luxury’ (250CC and above) segments respectively. The most popular high-end models found on OLX are Harley Davidson Street 750, KTM Duke, and Royal Enfield Classic 500,” said Amarjit Singh Batra, CEO, OLX India, 
 
 Droom too has seen a sharp spurt in its best-selling superbikes — KTM Duke, Harley Iron 883, KTM RC 390, Harley Street 750, Harley Superlow, Suzuki Intruder M1800R, Kawasaki Ninja 1000 and the Suzuki Hayabusa. “We have also seen a shortening of average duration of ownership across two wheelers but super bikes have had the sharpest fall,” said Droom’s Aggarwal. “Scooters have come down from 55 months in 2012-13 to 48 months in 2016, motorcycles from 60 months in 2012-13 to 53 months in 2016 and super bikes from 40 months in 2012-13 down to 29 months in 2016,” he added.
 
 Unlike the used car market, India’s two-wheeler market is largely unorganized despite being four times its size, but is vrooming nicely. OLX for instance has grown its used two-wheeler segment by 3 times in the last years. Already for every new two wheeler sold in India, 1.8 used two wheelers are sold. According to market estimates by Droom, in calendar 2016 the used and new two wheeler industry was worth $32.4 billion with new vehicles comprising $16.3 billion and used $16.1 billion. In terms of unit shipment 15.2 million new and 27.4 million used two wheelers were shipped last calendar, a total of 42.6 million units.
 
 A large available vehicle pool is partly the reason for this turbo charged growth say experts. Even super bikes have been around for a while and 2014 and 2015 are the most popular years for this segment in the pre-used market. In terms of unit shipment, used two wheelers grew 29% in calendar 2016 while used super bikes grew 40% yoy. Of course, real volumes of used super bikes are still small but the value is not. “In terms of unit shipments, used super bikes are less than 2-3% (it is 1-1.5% in new super bikes) but in terms of value they are 20-25% of the total used motorcycles market,”said Aggarwal. Two biggest markets for used superbikes are Delhi and Bengaluru.
