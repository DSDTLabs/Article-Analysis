CHANDIGARH: Finally,   has found takers for its ambitious flyover on the National Highway. After two failed attempts, the   department received response from three firms. A committee has been constituted to shortlist one firm. After selection, the committee will send it to the ministry for road transport and highways and shipping for approval. 

 To address the problem of traffic congestion, the ministry, last year, agreed to construct a flyover at the Sector 29/31/Industrial Area Phase I/ Industrial Area Phase II roundabout after MP   took up the issue with Union minister  . The project will cost the ministry around Rs 400 crore. After two failed attempts, Kher urged the ministry to ask empanelled consultants to take up the project. The consultant will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) of the project, which will be put up before the ministry for approval.
 
 In its comprehensive mobility plan submitted to the administration in 2009, RITES had mentioned that the roundabout witnesses high traffic volume of up to 1 lakh passenger car units each day. The project faced a threat from proposed move of the Punjab Public Works Department (PWD) (B&R) to re-route the national highway (NH) 21 from Zirakpur.
 
 Punjab PWD (B&R) has asked Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) to re-route NH 21 to Mohali.
