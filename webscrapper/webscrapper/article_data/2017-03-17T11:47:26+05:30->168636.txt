NASHIK: Over 1 crore major   of the civic department will be digitised to protect the important data.

 The   ( ) is yet to receive the list of documents from some departments, but the total documents to be digitised are estimated around one crore. 
 
 The plan to digitise important documents has been underway for the last two years, but the NMC could not start the initiative due to the Kumbh Mela and other factors. Moreover, the civic body did not have a full-time commissioner for a long time before the Kumbh Mela. 
 
 Currently, the documents planned to digitise are from the civic administration’s town planning, public works, accounts, legal, audit, water supply, garden health, property and education departments.
 
 “The municipal corporation has documents since 1992, the condition of which is not very good. We want to protect these documents through the digitisation process,” an NMC official said. 
 
 Once all the information is received, the proposal will be sent to municipal commissioner  . The project will be implemented through a private firm, which will be selected via tenders.
