JODHPUR: One person in connection with multiple cases of irregularities in   (JDA) has been arrested by  . The accused was acting as a personal assistant of absconding the then Chairman Rajendra Singh Solanki, a close aide of former chief minister  .

 The arrested,  , is said to have been a major force behind the irregularities, who alleged to have threatened engineers of JDA to get changes in works ordered at his behest and getting them recommended by ward councilor.
 
 SP (ACB) Ajay Pal Lamba said civil contractors, in most of the cases here, were his relatives and it has clearly been pointed out that all alterations and manipulations of already granted works were done by him.
 
 Lamba said he has come out to be a main culprit in these cases, who went to the extent of threatening the JDA engineers with transfer or putting them on APO.
 
 “He did so with those who did not give in to his pressure and got them replaced by those who agreed to be guided by him,” Lamba said.
 
 In one such case, he shifted the already ordered work to construct a community hall in Mansagar locality to a nearby park, getting it recommended by the concerned ward councilor and then again got a tender issued for same work, thereby causing a financial setback to JDA.
 
 He manipulated the entire tendering process from beginning and even tampered with e-tendering process by letting tender of one such work posted on JDA website for just one day against the rule of a month in order to facilitate the contractor, who was his relative. 
 
 A JDA said on condition of anonymity that there were many cases like this in JDA, wherein political pressure has led to shifting of the work from one place to other without following procedure regardless the rule of   or BJP just to get the political mileage or for benefits of near and dear ones.
