NEW DELHI:  's hopes of winning her second title of the season in as many tournaments dealt a jolt as she lost the   final with Czech partner   on Friday.

 The Indo-Czech pair suffered a straight-set defeat 4-6, 4-6 at the hands of   of Hungary and   of Russia in the summit clash.
 
 Sania and Strycova made it to the final after prevailing over America's Vania King and Yaroslava Shvedova from Kazakhstan 6-1, 6-2 in just 51 minutes while Babos and Pavlyuchenkova defeated Andreja Klepac and María José Martínez Sánchez 6-3, 6-4 in the other semi-final.
 
 After splitting with Martina Hingis last year in August, it was Sania's sixth final in eight tournaments.
 
 She won the Cincinnati and Tokyo events with Strycova and the New Haven tournament with Monica Niculescu. It's only at the US Open (Quarter-finals) and Beijing (2nd round) events that she made an early exit.
 
 Last week, Sania had won the season-opener Brisbane event with Bethanie Mattek-Sands but ironically lost her world number one rank to the American, who jumped five places to dislodge the Indian from the top spot.
