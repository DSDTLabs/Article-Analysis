PANAJI: National Students' Union of India ( ) on Monday demanded that chief minister   must resign if he cannot provide alternative career options to hundreds of students left in the lurch due to the closure of mining. 

 "There is an impression that only truck owners and barge operators are affected by the mining ban. Many more youth are staring at a blank future," NSUI Goa head   said. 
 
 NSUI said that from the 2017 batch of engineering students who pursued a specialization in mining, not a single student had got a job. "The chief minister has to resign since he is the education minister," Mulla said.
