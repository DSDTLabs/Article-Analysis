 DEHRADUN: A   probing appointment of teachers suspected to have used fake education certificates to get jobs in government schools have found five more of such cases. This takes the total number of teachers who had furnished fake documents to get jobs to 35. Over 150 complaints of   produced by teachers are being investigated by the SIT.
  
  Of the five new teachers found guilty, one who was working at a school in Doiwala had produced fake documents, while the other four had degrees from unrecognised institutes.
  
  SIT chief, additional superintendent of police (ASP) Shweta Choubey, said, “In one of the recent cases, we found that the teacher had passed class 10th in 1996 and ten years after that had gotten a degree from an unrecognised university. We have informed the education department about the cases.”
  
  The matter of teachers with fake degrees came to light after an   activist submitted a list of 217 such teachers asking that documents submitted by them should be investigated. Education minister   then set up a committee to investigate the appointments made after 2016.
