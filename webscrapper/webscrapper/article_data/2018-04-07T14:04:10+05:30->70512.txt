ERODE: There is a reason for the residents and farmers of Erode and neighbouring districts to rejoice. They may in all probability have enough water for potable and irrigation purposes throughout the summer, as water has been released from Pillur dam in Coimbatore district to   dam here.

 Water level in Bhavanisagar dam has been witnessing a steady rise since Wednesday evening, when the water from Pillur dam reached the reservoir in Erode.
 
 According to officials attached to the   (PWD), Coimbatore district administration released the water from Pillur dam after its water level reached satisfactory level following the recent rain. “They have released about 500cusecs (cubic feet per second) water from the dam,” said a PWD official.
 
 The water released from Pillur dam reached Bhavanisagar dam on Wednesday late evening. Subsequently, the water flow to the dam was increased to 1,592cusecs from 1,069cusecs. “Now the water level in the Bhavanisagar dam stands at 54.36ft, against its full capacity of 120ft,” the PWD official added.
 
 Though Bhavanisagar dam is 130ft high, water can be stored only at a height of 120ft. If the dam were to receive surplus water, the entire quantity would be diverted to lower Bhavani project ayacut canal and old ayacuts of Bhavani river, including Kalingarayan, Thadapalli and Arakkankottai.
 
 The dam is the primary water source for more than 2.5 lakh acres spread across Erode, Karur and Tirupur districts. Water level in the dam had plummeted fast in the past three years due to poor monsoon.
 
 PWD officials said the present water level in the dam was satisfactory. “We have 5.5 thousand million cubic feet water in the dam. With this much water, we can easily survive until June. So, the entire Erode and neighbouring districts will have enough water for drinking purpose as well as to meet irrigation needs throughout the summer,” an official said.
