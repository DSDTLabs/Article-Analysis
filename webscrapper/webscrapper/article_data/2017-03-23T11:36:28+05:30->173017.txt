Shravan blames Raman for his mother's death and Bala supports him. Bala says he has seen the CCTV footage and saw Raman's car hitting Vandi. Mihika and Pihu leave.
 
  Ishita and Mani go to the police station. They try telling the police that Raman can't do something like this. Police inspector tells them that they have got another footage and got to know about an eyewitness.
  
  The police then confronts Ishita for knowing that Raman hit Vandi and not informing the police, so she will be taken under custody.
  
  
 
  
  Raman doesn't want Ishita to get dragged and takes the blame on him. Ishita is shocked and asks Raman to tell her the truth. She then takes permission to talk to him alone for 5 minutes.
  
  Ishita asks Raman if he did the accident or not and she is sure that he didn't. Raman is rigid and doesn't tell the truth. Ishita then makes Raman swear on her. He finally tells her that he wasn't driving the car but can't tell where he was at the time of the accident.
  
  The two come out and Madhavi slaps Raman and accuses him of Vandi's murder.
