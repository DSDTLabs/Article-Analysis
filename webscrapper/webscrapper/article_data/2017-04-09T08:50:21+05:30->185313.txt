INDORE: Quite a few eyebrows were raised when batting great   surprisingly named   as the captain of Kings XI Punjab this season. The 'Big Show' had a disastrous   last year, managing just 179 runs in 11 games@19.88, and many felt that the Aussie was lucky to still be retained by the Kings.

 Sehwag, though, seems to be going by the theory that leadership may just bring out the best in this maverick player. It did, here on Thursday after noon, as Maxwell smashed a typically blazing cameo (44 not out, 20b, 4x6, 2x4) to help Kings XI Punjab launch their campaign with a six-wicket win over the Rising Pune Supergiant.
 
 Chasing 164, the Kings seemed to be floundering at 85 for four, before Maxwell and   (30 not out, 27b, 1x4, 2x6), who too had a poor IPL last year, took control of the chase, adding 79 runs in 47 balls in the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership to seal the win and bring a wide smile to owner Preity Zinta's face. With the Pune total not formidable enough, Maxwell chose to promote 'keeper Wriddhiman Saha (13, 9b, 3x4) to No 3 and then all-rounder Axar Patel (24, 22b, 1x4, 1x6) to No.4, holding himself and Miller back to finish off the games -a strategy which paid off.
 
 In a tournament which has seen 180s being chased without breaking a sweat so far, Pune's total was not going to be enough. Appearing determined to make amends for last season's flop show, Maxwell began his onslaught with a huge six. He later pulled Imran Tahir for two more sixes to revive memories of the first leg of the 2014 IPL season in the UAE when he looked unstoppable. The assault on Tahir did much to calm Kings' nerves since the leggie, after having picked up three wickets in his last game, had begun to look dangerous, accounting for Saha and Patel's dismissal.
 
 Earlier, a blazing half-century from Ben Stokes (50, 32b, 2x4, 3x6), who's beginning to justify the Rs 14.5 crore tag, and a quickfire, unbeaten 40-run cameo (23b, 3x4, 2x6) by Manoj Tiwary, helped the Supergiant put up a fighting 163 for six after they had slipped to 71 for four by the 12thover.
