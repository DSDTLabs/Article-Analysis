GREATER NOIDA:   have found   in the   of the   girl who had alleged on Monday that she had been   by a   and two other   in a   in which she had been offered a lift home.

 The classmate of the Class XI student was questioned on Tuesday in connection with the allegation and police said he had refuted the girl’s gang-rape claim. Police, too, seemed to doubt the allegation, saying a medical examination of the girl did not reveal any external injury. The cops said on Tuesday the girl had “met” the accused boys in Kasna area, contrary to the claim that she had been offered a lift.
 
 “In her statement to police, she had alleged gang rape by all the three youths. But in her statement before the judicial magistrate, she had said she was not sure if the classmate was involved as she had passed out by then,” SP (rural) Suniti said.
 
 Police said they were examining both the recorded statements. The cops are also trying to question a distant relative of the girl and his friend who, too, have been accused of gang rape. 
 
 The girl had alleged on Monday that she was walking home with a female friend after missing the school bus when the trio offered her a lift in a car. The girl had said she was gang-raped in the car by the three who dumped her near Knowledge Park area around 1am.
 
 However, the female friend of the girl with whom she was walking home has apparently told police the girl had volunteered to accompany her classmate and another youth who had come in a scooter, not car. 
 
 “We questioned the boy (the classmate). He told us the girl had accompanied them voluntarily and was trying to reach the third accused (the distant relative) over the phone. Both the boy and the girl did not carry phones and had asked a shopkeeper for his phone to call the relative. We have questioned the shopkeeper and the call records have confirmed the boy’s claims,” the SP said. When TOI contacted the girl’s father, he backed his daughter’s allegation.
