WUHAN: Like a slowly revving engine,  's challenge in the Dongfeng Motor   sparked to life midway through the title round clash against Australia's  . The 23-year old went from strength to strength in a match in which her opponent, Barty of the bountiful backhand, ran out of reserve.

 Then, after serving out the two-hour-43-minute contest 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, Garcia's first final in 15 months, the Frenchwoman collapsed on the court, burying her face in her palm. A long-awaited and hard-earned crown, a WTA Premier 5 title, the biggest win of her career.
 
 "A title is the best thing in tennis, big, small whatever. That's what you fight for all year long. I can't describe the way I feel. I'm over the moon," Garcia said. "It's a pleasure to share the court with Ashleigh. She's a great competitor, you have to remember that she came back to tennis just one-and-a-half years ago. You have to give her credit for that. It's a pleasure to have her on the Tour again, she'd one of the nicest people." Garcia, who had triumphed in pair's only meeting six years ago in US Open (juniors), took home $487,245 and 900 points that will take her ranking to a career-high No.16. Long-legged ace is now in an uphill chase to make the season-ending field in Singapore.
