BENGALURU: Chief Minister   said on Monday that   will be free of open defecation by March.

 Speaking at Gandhi Jayanti celebrations at Palace Grounds, the chief minister declared 1,937 gram panchayats, 51 taluks and 10,340 villages in the state open-defecation free. As per 2011 Census, there are 27,586 villages in Karnataka.
 
 “We have taken several initiatives to be free of open defecation.   elected representatives should join hands to ensure the campaign's success considering that nearly half of around 6,000 gram panchayats in Karnataka have woman presi dents. They have a big role to play in making their locality open-defecation-free,“ he said.
 
 “The state government had earlier planned to achieve `open-defecation free' tag by October next year, but the deadline now has been ad vanced in the wake of upcoming assembly election,“ the chief minister added.
 
 Taking dig at  's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, former union minister   said: “It was the previous UPA government that launched Total Sanitation Campaign (20042014), which the incumbent government has renamed as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. It should be a national movement irrespective.“ He lauded the state for earning the opendefecation free tag.
 
 Rural development and panchayat raj minister HK Patil said there was considerable progress in construction of toilets in the state. “We have also sought additional funds from the centre,“ he said.
