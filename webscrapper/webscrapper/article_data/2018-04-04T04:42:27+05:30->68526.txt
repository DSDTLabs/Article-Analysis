MUMBAI: The   is planning to send a delegation of party MPs to PM   to demand immediate relief to consumers following the latest hike in  , according to party sources. 

  A decision on the composition of the delegation and details of the memorandum to be submitted to Modi would be taken after consulting Sena president  , sources said. Thackeray is holidaying abroad and is expected to return next week, it is learnt. 
 
 The Sena strategists are of the view that the petrol diesel hike would trigger ire among Mumbaikars against the   regime in the run up to the general elections which are a year away. "Even if the Sena goes solo in the coming elections, voters may hold us equally responsible for the price rise as the Sena is still a constituent ally in the NDA," said a senior Sena functionary. "Our MPs will meet oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan if Modi has a tight schedule," he added. Meanwhile, Saamna has pulled up the NDA regime for the "vicious cycle" of unabated rise in petroleum prices. "Are the countrymen paying the price for following the 'achche din' dream?" asked Saamna in an editorial on Tuesday.
