MUMBAI:   missed the deadline set by Governor Ch   Rao to declare all   by July 31, prompting him to extend it till August 5. By Monday night, TYBSc results were out, but results of 64% of the 477 exams are still pending. 

 Some glitches in the production stage of results shocked teachers who have already completed assessment. Missing papers in some subjects has delayed results. A teacher said in commerce subjects many papers are missing. "The number of students who wrote the exam doesn't match available answer scripts," said a teacher. Another teacher said there are cases one answer booklet may have been assigned to two seat numbers during scanning. "It is evident from handwritings on the answer scripts. The university is trying to resolve the issue," said the teacher.
 
 Around 15 results were announced on Monday, including the fifth and sixth semester results of BSc; some first semester engineering results were also out. A total 2.9 lakh answer scripts are yet to be assessed and about 1 lakh need to be moderated. The count of papers went up from Saturday's 2.7 lakh as several papers in the miscellaneous folders were now loading up in the system. Registrar M A Khan said papers rejected by teachers (as they were wrongly allotted) were saved in the miscellaneous folders. "These are now in the pool," said Khan. He said the university is trying its best to announce results by August 5.
 
 Of the yet-to-be-assessed answer books, over 70% are pending from commerce. Law makes up another 10% and management and other courses make the rest. In fact, not a single result from the law faculty was announced till Monday.
