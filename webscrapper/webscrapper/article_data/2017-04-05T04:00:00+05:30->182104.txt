Vadodara: The greenest city amongst the four largest in the state is facing the daunting task of protecting its green cover. 

 With the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) embarking on a major road widening drive, concerns are being expressed on the fate of the decades-old trees on the edge of the roads. 
 
 Eyebrows were raised when the VMC started chopping branches of trees on the Jail Road. While the civic body was looking to retain the string of trees on the road, some trees that had grown naturally in the royal Gaekwad family’s land that was acquired for road widening needed to be taken care of. 
 
 Experts who came to know of the predicament approached the civic body on Sunday when the work was being done and a decision was taken to ensure that the trees were transplanted.
 
 “We are looking to translocate six trees. These include three Kanjo trees and one tree each of Neem, Andrakh and Bhadraksh varieties. Those involved with the work on the road have been given instructions to ensure that necessary work is done to ensure that the trees can survive,” said botanist and director of Community Science Centre Dr Jitendra Gavali.
 
 Gavali, however, said that several precautions will have to be taken and the relocation of the trees will be a daunting task. 
 
 “We will have to work on them meticulously to ensure that they survive. Attempts are also being made to ensure that no other tree is felled,” he said. VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the civic body will fell trees only when it is inevitable. 
 
 “Only a couple of trees on the Jail Road will have to be felled. Elsewhere too, we have cut only one tree in Jetalpur. All trees in Alkapuri will be retained and we have even used them as dividers for the Faramji Road,” he said.
