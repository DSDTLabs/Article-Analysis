PANAJI: In a bid to instill patriotism and create awareness among villagers, the government has decided to observe   on May 13, for a clean and green Goa. 

 Panchayat minister   said the initiative by the directorate of panchayats will serve a lot of purposes. “Places for tree plantation will be identified and we will make plans for a neat and green Goa,”   said, while addressing a programme organised by the directorate of panchayats in   recently.
 
 “The panchayat is one of the important grass-roots level bodies. Unity among its members is the key towards a successful, strong and stable panchayat. Good governance is a foul cry if the village body changes its sarpanch twice or thrice in a year. This not only harms the administration, but also restricts development,” he said.
 
 Godinho asked panchayat department officials to use their powers with responsibility. “Be punctual and be present in office. Government officials are bound to deliver on time. They must listen to the elected representatives and need not overpower them. They are expected to deliver solutions and not confrontations,” he said.
 
 He also promised to visit each village panchayat to acknowledge their grievances. He added, “More than 60% of the state’s area is covered by villages and it is the responsibility of the village administration to maintain peace among the villagers.”
