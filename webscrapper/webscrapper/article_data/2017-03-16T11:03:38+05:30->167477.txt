PALANPUR: The killer  , which had mauled to death three persons including forester since Sunday, was shot dead after a tough six-hour operation undertaken by 150-strong staff of the   and locals in Kansa forest near Danta. 

 The local forest officials had taken permission from the   to kill the animal as it had turned extremely violent and was difficult to cage.
 
 The operation involved sharpshooters from the   too and as many as 10   were installed at various locations to trace the bear, said IK Barad, deputy conservator of forest, Banaskantha. “We started the operation at around 7am and the bear was finally spotted and shot at sight in the afternoon,” he said.
 
 “Efforts to trace the bear were also not yielding any result as its pug marks were not visible on the rocky terrain,” said Barad. 
 
 The bear had killed two persons from Khapra village on Sunday and Monday. The deaths had triggered massive anger as well as fear among people who wanted the animal killed. The villagers had ignited bonfires throughout the night to keep the bear at bay. 
 
 On Sunday, the bear had killed Bhikha Bhagora(35), who was grazing his herd of sheep in the forest. On Monday, it attacked Mana Angari (25), one of the persons in a group of villagers who had gone to trace Bhagora. Again on Tuesday, it badly mauled forest staffer RH Patni. Four others including two forest staffers who were injured are still under treatment in Palanapur.
