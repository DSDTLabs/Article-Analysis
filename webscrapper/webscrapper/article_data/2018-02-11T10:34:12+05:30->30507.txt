Chandigarh: Even though a district court denied   to Punjab   secretary Shashi Lakhanpal Mishra for non-bailable offences related to dowry and cheating, she conducted an examination in the assembly complex on Saturday without being arrested.

 Chandigarh Police booked Shashi, her husband (SM Mishra), and her son ( ) nine months ago but have failed to arrest her, so far, despite submitting a written statement that she is not cooperating in the investigation. Shashi and her family are charged with harassing her daughter-in-law for dowry. 
 
 They were booked under Section 420 (cheating and dishonest way of inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 498A (when a husband or relative subjects a woman to cruelty) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Many of these sections relate to non-bailable offences.
 
 The case against them was registered on May 18, 2017, at the women’s police station of Sector 17. Shashi and her husband live in Sector 38, and their son in the US. The complainant is Punjab and Haryana High court deputy advocate general  .
 
 On Saturday, a day after her anticipatory bail was dismissed by the court,   conducted an examination for the junior-scale stenographers at the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. When contacted about the details, superintendent of police (women’s and child support unit) Ravi Kumar said: “The investigation is going on and, if necessary, we will arrest her.” This comes after the police already have filed a written statement in the district court that she is not cooperating with them.
 
 Police had filed this reply to her application for anticipatory bail. It had submitted that: “The accused petitioners were asked to produce… Janesh Mishra for joining the investigation, but they failed to do so in spite of giving verbal assurances. The accused… are not cooperating in the investigation and their anticipatory bail should be dismissed in the interest of justice.”
