MADURAI: The   movements (TAFALIM) on Sunday condemned minister  's comment that if the state completely bans sale of alcohol then many men will die after consuming illicit liquor. 

 During a public function on Saturday, he said, "Let me tell you (women), if not for   shops, many men would have died after consuming illicit liquor. It is upon the addict to stop drinking,'' he said.
 
 Convenor of TAFALIM, C J Rajan, said that the minister's speech was highly condemnable. "By promoting liquor, the minister has shown that they are not committed to keeping their poll promise to the people, on total prohibition. Recently the government had announced that it had set aside 3 crore to create awareness on the ill effects of liquor and here, a minister was speaking, about the advantages of Tasmac,'' he said.
