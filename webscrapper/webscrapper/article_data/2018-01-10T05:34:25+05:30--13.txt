MUMBAI: The BEST administration on Tuesday announced scrapping of 159 singledecker buses, further reducing the number of buses on the road.

 Protesting the decision, BEST committee members said the move would hit commuters. “It will affect frequency on several routes and commuters will have to wait longer at bus stops. This is unwarranted as these 159 buses have not completed the stipulated life span of 15 years,” said   member Sunil Ganacharya.
 
 He said from over 4,200 buses a few years ago, the fleet was down to less than 3,500 now. BEST general manager   said the fleet currently comprised 3,496 buses. “We have decided to scrap the buses by January 31. A fleet size of 3,337 buses will be good enough to run operations and maintenance burden too will be reduced,” he said, adding the buses being scrapped were more than 14 years old.
 
 TOI was the first to report on the BEST plans to reduce its fleet size to the lowest ever in recent years.
 
 On Tuesday, when the BEST presented its statistical report on the existing fleet, it showed the reduced fleet of 3,337 buses also included 25 hybrid electric and two electric buses which are yet to arrive on the roads. A panel member expressed apprehension that this could lead to further migration of commuters to autos and ‘kaali peelis’.
 
 Bagde countered this saying a fleet of 3,240 was “adequate”. “In future, we will not purchase buses, but will opt for wet lease based on demand,” he said.
 
 A proposal to procure 100 mini AC, 100 mini non AC and 25 midi buses on lease is gathering dust in BEST files.   refused to comment, while committee members said they were yet to discuss the issue. “We are not against introducing new buses on wet lease, but it should not be at the cost of favouring some private contractor,” a panel member.
