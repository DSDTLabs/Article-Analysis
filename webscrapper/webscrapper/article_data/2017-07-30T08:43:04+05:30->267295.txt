BENGALURU: Battling against physically stronger teams has been India's biggest worry but at the   on Saturday, they banished their demons in style. In a match that was slowly slipping away from their grasps, India came from behind in the final quarter to stun Kazakhstan 75-73 and secure their return to Asia's top-tier in the FIBA Women's  .

 The Indian women, under skipper Anitha Pauldurai, will now compete among Asia's elite teams in the 2019 edition.   Federation of India president   announced a cash award of Rs 10 lakh to the winning team.
 
 In the Division B final, the hosts were made to sweat by 6â€œ4' Kazakh centre   (30 points, 18 rebounds), who trampled through the Indian defence to grab 13 offensive rebounds and convert a majority of their 28 second chance attempts. By the end of the third quarter, India trailed by eight points and needed a turnaround similar to the one they had against Lebanon in Friday's semifinal.
 
 And what a turnaround it was. Led by Jeena Skaria (20) and Shireen Limaye (17), the hosts began their fightback, draining buckets from the paint and double-teaming Kondrakova to stop her offensive charge. A near-capacity egged their players on as Kazakhstan's campaign began to crumble.
 
 
 
 
 A Japan exacted revenge for their 2016 Rio Olympics loss, edging Australia 74-73 and clinched their third straight Women's Asia Cup title in the Division A final. Leading until the first half of the third quarter -thanks to a phenomenal 30-point haul by tournament MVP Kelsey Griffin -Australia failed to contain their lead as Japan hit back with intent. Saki Mizushima (26) did the bulk of the scoring.
