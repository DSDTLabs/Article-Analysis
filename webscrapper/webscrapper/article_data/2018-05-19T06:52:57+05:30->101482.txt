GURUGRAM: An Uber cab driver had a narrow escape on Friday morning after his car rammed into a parked tractor and then hit a   near   underpass. 

 According to the 30-year-old cab driver, he was heading towards Sector 56 from   at 7.30 am when the accident happened. 
 
 He told cops that he had fallen asleep while driving and woke up when his car, a white-coloured  , hit a tractor near Genpact Chowk. He immediately tried to control the car, but in his effort ended up hitting the divider and then coming to a halt.
 
 A passer-by informed the cops about the accident after which a team headed by ASI Krishan Kumar reached the spot and rescued the driver. 
 
 “The cab driver had his seat belt on which saved his life. As the accident took place early in the morning, no one else was injured. With the help of a crane, we moved the cab to the roadside and took the cab driver to a nearby hospital where he was treated for the minor injuries he received following the crash. He was later discharged,” Kumar said. 
 
 Police sources said that no case was registered in the matter .
 
 After getting information about the accident, the owner of the cab reached the spot but after finding out that the accident was the driver’s fault, he did not file a police complaint. 
 
 “The cab was registered with Uber and was returning after completing a ride,” said inspector  , SHO, Sector 53 police station. 
 
 It may be noted that this is the second accident reported near an underpass within 24 hours. On Thursday, a woman had a narrow escape after her Maruti Baleno turned turtle inside the Rajiv Chowk underpass, when she lost control of the car on the poorly lit stretch.
