People with credit or debit cards do not have to stand in queues at the board office. They can make their payments online,” said MA Zafar, media officer, MCB.
  
  Paying house tax and other municipal taxes was previously a major issue for the residents of the Cantonment area as only a single window was available for payment of all taxes. It would often get overcrowded and people would have to stand in queues for long hours. The online payment gateway will be a major relief for the residents.
  
  “It is a welcome step. It will make our life much easier as we do not have to stand in queues for long hours any more. However, we have to see how well the online payment gateway will work,” said N K Singh, a resident of Cantonment area.
