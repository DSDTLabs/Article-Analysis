LUCKNOW: At a   in September 2016, when rum blings of trouble in the   family were beginning to surface, an irked Mulayam had asked, “What has Akhilesh done except ride the bicycle before being sworn to power in 2012?“ It is true that   rode the cycle to success in 2012. His 250-km-long   through the length and breadth of UP saw him working on a change of image not only for the Samajwadi Party, but even for the rusty, dust-laden cycle from Saifai.

 As the BMW bike inched its way closer to the power corridors in Lucknow, Akhilesh ensured professionals replaced muscle-men on SP's list of ticketseekers, and laptops gave way to the 'lalten' in the Samajwadi discourse.
 
 Riding his branded cycle, Akhilesh led to the birth of a modern socialist neta who was forward looking with his grassroots connect intact.
 
 If his bicyle catapulted Akhilesh to the chief minister's office in 2012, the CM has used the party symbol amply and to advantageous effect ever since. He made UP the first Indian state to build cycle highways cutting across towns and in November 2016, got about 150 cyclists from across the globe to ride their bicyles on the AgraEtawah cycle highway.
 
 So, in response to Mulayam's 'what-did-he-do-except-ride-thecycle' jibe, Akhilesh has quite a few answers. He smoothed out the bumpy patches and put the cycle on the development highway.
