PATNA: Chief minister   on Monday called upon Gandhians and social activists to ponder over the country’s current scenario and suggest as to which way the nation should proceed.
 
  Addressing the national conclave on Mahatma Gandhi here, the CM said, “You should discuss all the relevant issues and set an agenda for the country. You should tell the people as to which way the nation should go from now,” Nitish said.
  
  Expressing concern over “environment of intolerance and confrontation” in the country, he said some forces were trying to influence the people by their “baseless arguments”. “It is high time for the people who believe in the ideology of Gandhi to discuss the issues threadbare and set an agenda for the country. I am happy that you all have accepted my invitation to participate in this conclave,” Nitish said.
  
  In an oblique reference to   president Amit Shah’s proposed ‘yatra’ at   on April 19, the CM said, “Now, even those people who always remained against the ideology of Gandhi, are planning to take out yatras in the name of father of the nation. These are people who believe only in encashing the name of Gandhi. They don’t believe in philosophy and ideology of Gandhi.”
  
  Bihar deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and education minister Ashok Choudhary were also present on the dais along with noted Gandhians.
