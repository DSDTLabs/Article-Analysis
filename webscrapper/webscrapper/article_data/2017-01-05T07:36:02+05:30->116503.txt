CHENNAI: Was our judicial system so flawed it set a killer free, giving him a chance to murder in cold blood yet again?

 Police arrested Anandan, 45, for murdering a sanitation worker at Vellavedu near Tiruvallur on Tuesday . The   police apprehended Anandan when they found him acting furtively on Railway Feeder Road, Tiruvallur, on Tuesday night.
 
 Policemen frisked Anandan and found that he was carrying a concealed knife. When police officers questioned him, Anandan said he was in the area looking for potential targets to rob.
 
 Police registered a case and arrested Anandan, a resident of Thirumazhisai, for attempted robbery. Investigators made out a case of mur der after finding that Anandan had murdered Baskar, 45, a resident of Thirumazhisai, on December 31. During interrogation, Anandan confessed to have murdered   to steal money from him.
 
 Investigators said Baskar and Anandan consumed alcohol on December 31. When Baskar refused to part with his money, Anandan attacked him with a knife. Anandan told police that he took the Rs 400 that Baskar was carrying and fled the scene.
 
 The Tiruvallur Town police informed their counterparts in Vellavedu, where the homicide took place, that they had arrested a suspect who had confessed to the crime. The Tiruvallur Town police registered a case and arrested Anandan. A court remanded Anandan in jail in judicial custody as investigators built acase against him.
 
 Anandan later revealed that on April 13, 2016 he had murdered Karuppan, 40, in   near Thirumazhisai. On April 28, Anandan murdered  , 45, near a marriage hall in Thirumazhisai.
 
 Acourt had granted Anandan -arrested for the two murders -bail in the cases barely 10 days before he killed Baskar. “We were fortunate to arrest Anandan before he had a chance to kill again,“ an investigating officer said.
