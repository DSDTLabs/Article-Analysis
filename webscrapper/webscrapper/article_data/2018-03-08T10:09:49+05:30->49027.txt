CHENNAI: With the construction of the underground metro line across   nearing completion, the highways department has started work to renovate three pedestrian subways on the arterial road. The subways near  , Thousand Lights and   will get a makeover for more than 3 crore. 

 The pedestrian subway near Anna Flyover has been cordoned off and work has begun to revamp the entry structure. The outer structure on the road will be widened and canopies with transparent panels on the sides will be installed. "It will take two months for us to complete the work.

 While they are cleaned regularly, officials said the subways have not been renovated for quite some time. The interiors would be improved with better lighting while cracks and leaks would also be fixed.
 
 The subway near Anna Flyover is close to a school and the US consulate while commuters to the suburban and metro stations and bus stand at Guindy as well as those employed at the industrial estate regularly use the pedestrian subway there. "The subway is always busy. There's barely any space to walk. The department should conduct periodic maintenance," said K  , a private company employee in Guindy.
 
 With metro stations along Anna Salai expected to be opened soon, these subways are likely to see more footfall. The entry structures of the metro stations from AG-DMS to   are getting finishing touches. The line covering a stretch of 3.3km is likely to open by April.
