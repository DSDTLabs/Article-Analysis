Babu, Rani and Badshah are beating the sultry Kolkata heat with curd and rice, fresh fruits and cool baths. It’s not that they are forced to brave the sun and go shopping for these summer coolers; their keepers at the   take care of that. But that doesn’t make summer any less difficult for Rani — an Asian elephant — Babu, a chimpanzee, or Badshah, a hippopotamus. Their fellow inmates are receiving equal care as the mercury crawls its way up day after day.
According to zoo director  , the inmates need special care in summer as they don’t have access to their natural habitat, where they use various methods to keep their body temperature in check. “In captivity, they can’t do that for obvious reasons, so we have to help them stay cool,” he said, adding that as birds are more affected by heat than mammals, the zoo provides them extra water to bath and stay cool along with extra shade. 
 
  
  
  
 
 Samanta told us that all zoo inmates start getting regular showers from March-end. While the birds enjoy it the most, even large mammals like elephants and Indian bisons wait for that time of the day. “Regular showers help keep their body temperature down, which is a must in summer,” he said. The reptiles, on the other hand, get fans in their enclosures to beat the heat. 
 
  
 
 Every animal has different dietary needs for summer and the zoo authorities make sure they get it.  , for instance, are given a reduced quantity of buffalo meat to keep their body temperature down. So, instead of the regular 8 kilos, they get 6.5 kilos in summer. Deer, antelopes and apes get meals that include watermelon, bell fruits and cucumber, while the Indian black bears get something special. “They are black, furry heat-sensitive animals, so they are given a special mix of curd, rice and honey. They are also given watermelons and cucumbers every day,” Samanta said, adding that the animals are also given electrolytes with water to reduce chances of dehydration or heat strokes.
