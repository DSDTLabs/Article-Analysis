 Second year resident doctor in the anesthesia department, Singh was on his way to JJ hospital on his Bullet when his bike skid at a curve and he lost control of the bike.
 
 “Singh lost control of his bike and crashed into the divider. The impact of the crash threw him several feet away. Since he was not wearing a helmet, he sustained severe head injuries,” said D Kundal, Senior Inspector, Pydhonie police station. On asked if Singh was on the phone while driving or if he was speeding, Kundal said, “We are yet to find any evidence to suggest either scenario. However, we have registered a case of accidental death”.
 
 Singh was immediately rushed to JJ hospital in a critical condition. “Our team of doctors tried to save Singh’s life but he succumbed to his injuries,” said Dr T P Lahane, Dean, JJ hospital. He said, “It is unfortunate that we lost Dr Tajindar Singh. He was one of our brightest doctors. His death causes us great sadness”.
 
 Dr Lahane was the one who had spearheaded the protest against allowing two wheelers on the flyover in 2012, after another resident doctor had died in the same manner. On Thursday, he called an urgent meeting with all resident doctors and MBBS students of the hospital and requested them to not ride their two wheelers over the JJ flyover. “Traffic cops were supposed to be present on the flyover. Why was there no police officer in place? I have spoken to the traffic department and have demanded an explanation on this,” he said.
 
 Two wheelers are not allowed on the JJ flyover and the traffic department ensures strict measures to enforce the rule. During the day, multiple traffic policemen are deployed at both ends, as well as on the flyover to apprehend anyone who flouts the rule. Clearly, there were no checks in place during the night of the incident.
