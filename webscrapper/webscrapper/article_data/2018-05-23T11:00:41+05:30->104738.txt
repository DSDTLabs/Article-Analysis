KOLKATA: The air intelligence unit of Kolkata customs on Wednesday stumbled upon around 5kg parwals being carried in a check-in luggage. When they opened the bag, officials found Euros hidden inside the vegetables.

 For the rest of the night, the customs officers on duty at the NSCBI   cut each of the seized parwals and took out   hidden inside it. Finally, they counted 310 currency notes of Euro 500 (around Rs 44 lakh).
 
 According to sources, two persons flying to Bangkok had put their luggage at the check-in counter and moved for security check when a customs official noticed the unusual luggage. “We have seen people trying to carry pickle. But it was something new. The flyers moved towards security check counter when we called them back,” said an official. “While we opened the luggage, there were hardly any apparel. The entire bag was filled with parwals,” he said. Initially they claimed that the parwal was for their friends and relatives in Bangkok. But when some of the parwals were slit open, there were Euro 500 notes inside each of them. They were also carrying $5,000, for which they had no document. The duo was arrested.
