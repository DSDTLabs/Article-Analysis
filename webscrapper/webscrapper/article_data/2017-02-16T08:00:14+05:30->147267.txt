NEW DELHI: It was a nostalgic moment for Justice (retired) Vikramjit Sen, the former   judge and also the Chief  , as he took over the reins of the Delhi and District Cricket Association ( ) here at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Wednesday.

 Even as the transfer of administrative duties from Justice (retired) Mukul Mudgal took place in the company of staff members and officials, Sen - a one-time medium-pacer - remembered for the hat-trick he took once at this ground while playing a friendly game. He proudly said that “all were straight to the stumps“. Will his appointment then herald an end to the “good old days” of proxies, freebies and nepotism here at the DDCA?
 
 “Cricket first and nothing else matters,” Sen told Delhi coach  . “You shouldn't come under anyone's pressure to pick certain players. We have to be right on top on the domestic circuit. For me, cricket and cricketers are the most important factors right now. He also added there wouldn't be any compromise on players' diets and daily allowances.
 
 Delhi's assistant coach and former international cricket Amit Bhandari told Justice Sen how coaches and support staff had not been paid for nearly five years. Sen was left aghast that even DDCA staff members, who number around 110, had not been paid since December last year. The road ahead is tough for the 66-year-old Sen, an ardent sports lover who hopes to rectify the problems that have plagued DDCA for years. His biggest challenge right now is the lack of funds. He is also looking to form a committee of 'cricket lovers' who will assist him and his team in day-to-day functioning.
 
 “I can tell you he has got more power to do the job in DDCA. He is also a very able athlete. He is a university blue in basketball and has played several sports like tennis, water polo. You are dealing with a hardcore sports lover,” Justice (Retd) Mudgal said while passing the baton.
