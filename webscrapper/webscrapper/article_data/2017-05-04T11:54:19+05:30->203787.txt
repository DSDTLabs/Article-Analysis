BENGALURU: Confusion prevails over the Karnataka government's ambitious   project, with two senior ministers expressing contradictory views.

 The project involves drilling underwater wells to 2,0008,000 metres in water-scarce areas by surface water veins.
 
 A week after rural development and panchayat minister H K Patil said the government plans to take up this project in 10 areas, including Kolar and  , to tide over the drinking water crisis, law and parliamentary affairs ministry T B   said they had no such plans as it goes against nature. â€œIt's a dangerous idea and may cause severe damage to the ecosystem," Jayachandra told reporters on Wednesday.
 
 At that depth, the law minister said there is a possibility of water having high arsenic and fluoride content that will be very harmful.
 
 Patil made the announcement impressed by a presentation made by a private company,   sources Management, this year in Delhi at a water conservation meet hosted by the Centre.
 
 Under the project, it plans to drill deep wells at spots identified by specialists who will detect with high precision the presence and location of naturally desalinated, self-recharging water sources that can supply water at a rate of 80,000 to 100,000 litres every hour.Each drill will cost around Rs 12.5 crore. Patil was keen on having this in his waterstarved home district Gadag as well as   and Kolar.
