 have finally been spotted in  . The state that is reeling under three   is likely to receive   earlier than expected – by the end of this month.

 On the heels of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)’s forecast that monsoon might enter   coast by the first week of June, comes the good news from the Bengaluru-based Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC). Its forecast says monsoon will be in the state by May 29.
 
 KSNDMC’s forecast for Karnataka is based on the favourable climatic conditions over the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean regions that bring South-West monsoon to the Southern Peninsula. KSNDMC Director Dr GS Srinivasa Reddy told BM, “If the situation remains similar for another one week, then we (Karnataka) will witness monsoon by the end of May.” Rains usually make it to Karnataka only by the second week of June.
 
 “We have communicated to the agriculture department too that there is a possibility of early monsoon so that directions can be issued to the farming community,” Dr Reddy said.
 
 He said this is not the first time they have got signs of an early monsoon. “A delay in the setting of monsoon results in evaporation of moisture content from the soil and atmosphere. Karnataka has already witnessed good pre-monsoon showers. All our revenue divisions, including the parched North Karnataka region, have seen either normal or above normal pre-monsoon showers. This indicates there is something good in the offing.”
 
 While the Malnad and coastal areas had so far received weak pre-monsoon showers, the deficit has been compensated by the intense rainfall since Sunday evening.
 
 “Going by the present condition, Karnataka is likely to receive good or near-good monsoon,” he said.
