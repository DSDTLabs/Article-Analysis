SURAT: The   that killed five people and made one seriously ill since Sunday last was manufactured in the city. 

 However, police are yet to identify the source of methyl alcohol that was mixed with Indian-made foreign liquor ( ) and subsequently consumed by victims during Uttarayan festival.
 
 Police investigation revealed that a woman bootlegger Sheela, who deals only in IMFL in Katargam, had sold four quarters of IMFL. She is suspected to have added some chemical powder to the liquor which was consumed by the victims. However, police are yet to find out who sourced the chemical and from where. Police suspect the chemical to be methyl alcohol. 
 
 Despite investigating about the suspect woman bootleggerâ€™s role since Wednesday, police are yet to find out the source of the IMFL. The bootlegger has given insufficient details to the police about the material that she mixed with IMFL.
 
 Police investigation revealed that after adding the chemical, colour and water to IMFL, the product was packed in pouches to be sold it was sold as English liquor and not country liquor, police sources said. 
 
 Police are yet to recover the spurious liquor that was sold by the suspects. In absence of the material, they are unable to find out exactly what substance was consumed by the victims. This is proving to be the biggest hindrance in the investigation of the case and police are unable to arrest anyone because of lack of evidence. 
 
 Police are also investigating the role of three other suspect bootleggers who operate from Katargam. Meanwhile, no more deaths due to spurious liquor were reported apart from the five victims who died earlier.
