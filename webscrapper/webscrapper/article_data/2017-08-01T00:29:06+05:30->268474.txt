Bhopal: Income tax payees faced tough time on Monday as the income tax department website was running painfully slow on Monday, the last day to file return for financial year 2016-17. 

 ‘Income tax returns’ was also trending on twitter throughout the day as people took to twitter explaining their difficulty to the Union finance minister and the deparment. The website runs slowly making it difficult to file the return, said Abhijit Agrawal, an executive with a private company. Tax payers heaved a sigh of relief when the government extended the deadline for filing the ITRs to August 5. But the issue of linking Aadhar with PAN continues.
 
 The department extended the last date to August 5 for filling return. “In fact, it did not work. In the digital era, the income tax e-filing portal was down for almost 72 hours,” he said.
 
 Abhijit was not only assessee, who was struggling and finding it difficult to file his income tax return (ITRs) on August 31. There were thousands other. The situation was even worse in rural Madhya Pradesh, where internet speed is also an issue.
 
 “On Saturday, the site worked almost 25% to its capacity. On Sunday, it functioned with 50% of efficiency and on Monday, it ran so slowly only two returns could be filed till 4 pm,” Nagendra Pawaiya, a chartered accountant said.
 
 “When I accessed the site, it showed under maintenance’ notification most of the time,” said Salil jain another CA in Bhopal. July 31 was the last date for filing of the ITR. It was also the deadline for linking the Aadhar with PAN.
 
 Raghav Rao, an assessee said the date for Aadhar-PAN linking should also be extended as people were not able to do it because the portal was not functioning.
 
 “Even otherwise for the past 15 days it was very difficult to complete task of linking of Aadhar with PAN,” he said.
 
 And as the deadline expired, a large number of people failed to link the two documents.
