SHIMLA: People residing in the snowbound tribal districts of Lahaul-Spiti and Pangi, who remain cut off from the rest of world during six winter months after snowfall makes driving on the road passing through   impossible, can now hope for all weather connectivity. The state government has decided to keep the stretch open during winters and invite international bidding for keeping Sachh Pass, Jalori Pass,   and   Pass open during winters. 

 Chief minister   said that many European countries get more snowfall than Himachal does, but the roads there remain open by using snow-clearing machines. He said that state government will invite international bidding for keeping the roads passing through high mountains with permission of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) open during winters.
 
 At present, the state government finds it a major challenge to provide air connectivity during emergency situations in snowbound areas in winter months. Many a times, flights cannot take off due to bad weather for days together.
 
 Thakur said while the construction of Rohtang tunnel is near completion, there is a need to construct tunnels to shorten the distances. “Our government has taken up the matter with the Centre to build a tunnel under Jalori Pass on Sainj-Luhari-Aut road on NH-305. Its tentative length is 4.2 km,” he added.
 
 Chief secretary   said efforts are being made to engage an international agency to keep the roads open during winters on the pattern of European countries, where even during heavy snowfall movement of vehicles remains unaffected.
