Reality shows these days are a storehouse of impeccable talents, be it an adults’ show or a kids’ programme.  , which is aired on TV during weekends, is a good example of the same. 

 As the judges such as music composers  ,   and  , along with singer   Mohan, analyse the skills and scope of each contestants, every new episode has been like a whirlwind of various emotions. 
 
 The one, aired at 8 pm on March 17, saw a mesmerising performance from Sreehari, who sang the much liked Tamil song Mankuyile Thenkuyile. The fact that his voice, texture and finesse was far beyond his age left the judges in awe of the singer in him. Sujatha, who fondly calls him her ‘mon’, was later asked to join him and croon the Ilaiyaraaja composition. 
 
 Deepak Dev was all praise for Sreehari, and said that he has not seen anyone sing the song with so much perfection at such a young age.
