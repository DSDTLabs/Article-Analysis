CHENNAI: Global reinsurer Swiss Re has pegged losses due to the   at $3 billion ( 19,463 crore) for 2016. However, only $400 million ( 25.95 crore) of these losses were insured. 

 In January, the Tamil Nadu government had sought a drought relief of 39,565 crore from the Centre for affected farmers. The government had sent a letter to the Prime Minister's office after assessing the impact in all 32 districts in Tamil Nadu, with a team that included commissioner of revenue administration   and revenue secretary B Chandra Mohan. 
 
 "There has been severe water shortage to paddy and rabi crops. Borewells in many districts don't yield enough water even for drinking requirements. With the land parched, grazing grounds for cattle has shrunk. Animal husbandry has also been hit as farmers spend more money on improving their water resources than feeding livestock. There has been an all-around impact," said officials from the state agriculture department.
 
 Swiss Re's figure of $400 million ( 25.95 crore) in insured drought losses, shows that only 0.13% of the $3 billion losses the state suffered was insured. 
 
 Data with the   of India show that Tamil Nadu's crop   penetration has increased from earlier. For 2015-16, crop insurance premium in the state grew 77% to 149.53 crore from 85.22 crore. But even this growth seems insufficient. 
 
 Revenue commissioner Satyagopal said, "We have undertaken a massive campaign to increase insurance penetration in the state. We have held camps, tried to increase awareness among farmers. Among the delta areas in particular, we have seen quite some success in getting people to sign for insurance under government-sponsored schemes."
 
 The Swiss Re report also mentioned that cyclone Vardah, which left 12 dead, caused $52 million in insured loss and $1 billion total damage. The reinsurer had earlier pegged losses due to December 2015 Chennai floods at $2.2 billion with insured losses mounting to $755 million.
