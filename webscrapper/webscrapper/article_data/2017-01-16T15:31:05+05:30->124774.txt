NEW DELHI: SP chief   on Monday said that he will accept whatever the   decides on the party symbol.

 Addressing party workers, Mulayam said, "We will accept whatever the Election Commission decides. I called Akhilesh three times. He dropped in for only a minute, and left even before I started to speak."
 
 "I am trying my best to save the party and cycle, and if he(Akhilesh) doesn't listen then I will fight against him," Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 
 
 The Election Commission is likely to give an interim order on the dispute, with the option of freezing the Ã§ycle' symbol most likely to be exercised.
 
 The three-member EC, headed by Nasim Zaidi, heard both the sides on Friday and reserved its order.
 
 The dispute arose following election of chief minister   as the national president of Samajwadi party at a national convention convened by party MP Ram Gopal Yadav on January 1.
 
 At the same convention, incumbent president Mulayam Singh Yadav was made the patron of the party.
 
 This was contested by Mulayam, who approached the EC and conveyed that he continues to be the party president and the election symbol should remain with his faction.
 
 This was contested by the other side, which filed affidavits by various party office bearers, MPs, MLAs and district presidents to claim that the majority was with the chief minister's faction and that it was the group which was entitled to the symbol.
 
 Under the Symbols' Order, the Commission heard the two sides on Friday. Noted lawyers Kapil Sibal and Rajeev Dhawan appeared for the Akhilesh faction and strongly argued for being allotted the   because it had the support of the majority in the party.
