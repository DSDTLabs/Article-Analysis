NEW DELHI: Welcoming the decision by the President to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said it has “protected democratic values”. He called for chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation.

 “We welcome the decision by the President to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs. His speedy decision has made a major contribution towards protecting democratic values…Though the   government is safe, it has lost reputation. I’ll suggest he should   and face the people again instead of going to court seeking relief. Let the people of Delhi decide.” He said the disqualified MLAs should be made to   the financial benefits they had taken. “Had this decision come earlier, AAP won’t have been able to send three members to the Rajya Sabha. We regret the delay,” Tiwari addeed.
 
 The disqualification has come as a big boost for the party. BJP has just four representatives in the 70-member assembly and can now look forward to improving its tally. Many in the party say that early elections will bolster its chances as they can cash in on the recent order though the ongoing sealing drive by the SC-appointed monitoring committee is a cause for concern. Sources say efforts are being made to stop the sealing drive. Tiwari and other senior leaders have made a representation to Union home minister Rajnath Singh and housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri in this regard.
 
 Recently, at the state executive, Tiwari directed all districts units of Delhi to start a campaign for exposing the AAP government on its “failure” to deliver on its 70 promises made during the assembly elections in 2015. “We have already started the work. BJP is ready for the bypolls,” he said. After its victory in the municipal elections in 2016, despite strong anti-incumbency, the party is optimistic about its victory.
