LUCKNOW: UP government's order fixing January 15 deadline to implement Allahabad high court's order banning unauthorised use of loud speakers drew mixed response from religious leaders in the city. They said that they were not against steps to check noise pollution, but expressed concern over the way it will be implemented. 

 Sheher quazi and Sunni cleric Maulana   Firangi Mahali urged the community not to panic in wake of the deadline set by state government. Posting a video on his social media, he said that if there is a law, it has to be followed. Later talking to TOI, he said: "I have urged the chiefs of different mosques to apply for permission as prescribed by the government. I have also formed a committee to help those who find the procedure difficult." 
 
 In an appeal to Yogi government, Khalid Rasheed said, "UP is a big state and it may not be possible for all mosques to obtain permission within deadline. The government may consider extending the last date." 
 
 Chief of Mankameshwar Mandir Trust,   said religious centres were a part of society in which judiciary holds an important place. "If the government has made a rule, we have to abide by it. But then, serious re-thinking on the implementation of the order is needed," she said. Echoing her concern, Khalid Rasheed said: "What will happen to temples and mosques in silent zones? There is a mosque next to   for instance." 
 
 President of Lucknow Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, RS Bagga, however, welcomed the move. Stating that   in Amritsar had issued orders for eco-friendly celebrations almost a decade ago, he said: "Since then, we did away with big loud speakers at Naka Gurdwara."
