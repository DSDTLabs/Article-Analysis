NAGPUR: A 64-year-old woman, fed up of police inaction despite constant harassment by her neighbours, has sought permission from chief minister   to end her life. She, along with some well-wishers, reached the Samadhan Shibir venue on Saturday evening, and displayed banners in this regard. Fadnavis heard her out, and directed deputy commissioner of police Rakesh Ola to take immediate action.

 Parvatibai Sharma, a resident of Surendragarh, has demanded that an offence should be registered against her neighbours, and Gittikhadan police inspector RN   be suspended.
 
 In her written complaint, Sharma alleged that she had caught her neighbour Kalpana Ghatode with another man, Hari Neware, in a comprising position in November 2017. The two beat her up and threatened to kill her if she told anybody about their affair.
 
 Sharma was so terrified that she fled to Gokulpeth, where she used to reside earlier. The next day, she lodged a complaint with Gittikhadan police station but police inspector RN Waghmare refused to take any action. Sharma did not return home, and started living in a temple at Gokulpeth.
 
 When she returned to her house on March 29, she found the lock broken. Four tolas of gold and Rs42,000 in cash were missing. Neware, Ghatode, Raju Anna, Prashant Ghatole and Raja Gopale again assaulted her, and asked her to leave the locality immediately. They claimed that they had the backing of   corporator Kamlesh Chaudhari, Sharma alleged.
 
 Sharma, along with temple trust secretary Shiva Juneja, went to Gittikhadan police station again, but PI Waghmare abused her and told her to leave. She then lodged a complaint with DCP Ola, but to no avail. Left with no options, she had sought permission to end her life.
