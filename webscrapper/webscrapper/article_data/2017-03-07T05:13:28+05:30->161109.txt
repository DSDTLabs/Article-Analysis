GURUGRAM: A city   has sentenced a 30-year-old man to   and slapped on him a fine of Rs 10,000 in a two-year-old   case. Based on circumstantial evidence and  ,   RK Mehta pronounced Pradeep Sharma (30) guilty of stabbing to death his sister-in-law.

 Elaborating on the case, public prosecutor Arvind Sharma said Pradeep had killed Gudia (25) on June 6, 2015, in a fit of rage following a brawl with her husband and his brother-in-law Dwarka Sharma. 
 
 Dwarka is the brother of Pradeep’s wife. Both Dwarka and Pradeep used to work as group-D staff at a private company and live in rented houses at Naharpur Village of Manesar.
 
 During investigation, it was found that Pradeep was allegedly trying to develop a relationship with Gudia, which had enraged Dwarka. “One day, Pradeep picked a fight with Dwarka. Later, he barged into Dwarka’s house and stabbed Gudia with a knife several times. She succumbed to her injuries on way to hospital,” said the public prosecutor. 
 
 On the basis of Dwarka’s complaint, the police had arrested Pradeep and recovered the murder weapon. Though eyewitness Bane Singh, who also lived in the same complex, turned hostile during the trial, circumstantial evidence and, most importantly, the forensic report played a crucial role in the case. “The forensic report showed that blood on the knife used in the murder and the clothes of the accused was the same, which established the involvement of Pradeep,” said Arvind.
 
 Though Pradeep’s lawyer tried to prove him innocent, claiming that the lone eyewitness had turned hostile, the court dismissed his argument and stressed that the forensic report and other evidence were enough to substantiate the charges mentioned in the chargesheet. The court, in its order, observed that Pradeep deserved no leniency and sent him to jail for life.
