NEW DELHI: Days after he ordered   to disclose records of BA degrees granted in 1978 — the year in which PM   is said to have received his bachelor’s degree, information commissioner M   has been asked to stop hearing cases related to the HRD ministry.

 Chief information commissioner R K Mathur issued the order on January 10, transferring all pending cases except those in which notices have been issued to another information commissioner Manjula Parasher.
 
 In a series of orders, Acharyulu had come down heavily on the university for not providing information, which in his view, was in public interest. BJP leaders had claimed last year that   had completed his BA in political science from distance learning programme of the university in 1978. This was later corroborated by Delhi University registrar Tarun Das.
 
 Acharyulu’s order, dated December 21, was on the plea of applicant Neeraj who had sought to know from the university the total number of students who took the BA exam in 1978, their names and those of their fathers, roll numbers and marks obtained. Denying the information, DU’s central public information officer (CPIO) had said the information requested was “personal information of the students concerned, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest”.
 
 Acharyulu, however, said, “The PIO has not put forward any evidence or explained possibility to show that disclosure of degree-related information infringes the privacy or causes unwarranted invasion of privacy.” Quoting orders from the United States and others, he held that the information was in fact in public interest.
 
 Earlier, Acharyulu in response to another RTI, had fined the university’s CPIO Rs 25,000 for rejecting an RTI application seeking PM’s graduation degree. The RTI filed by a Delhi-based lawyer was rejected on the ground that the Indian postal order was not marked in favour of the registrar of the university.
