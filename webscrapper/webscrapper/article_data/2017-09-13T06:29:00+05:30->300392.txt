LUCKNOW: Pointing out one of the probable reasons behind the   on September 6 and 8, Lucknow   Rail Corporation (LMRC) officials said since there was no 25KV testing track at their manufacturing plant, manufacturer   couldn’t conduct the required dynamic testing of trains before sending them to Lucknow. Hence,   had to do the test-runs at the depot.

 LMRC has apparently learnt a lesson from past technical snags and instructed supplier Alstom to test the trains up to 98% at the site, in Sri City (Andhra Pradesh), so that technical snag if any may be rectified at the plant before the trains are sent to Lucknow. So far, the trains were tested partially at the plant and then sent to LMRC for complete dynamic testing. 
 
 In Lucknow, the trains are moving on 25KV overhead traction, hence, need to be tested on the same track. In the first few trains, Alstom couldn’t conduct the test because it didn’t have the infrastructure but when LMRC demanded, Alstom had to build the track at their manufacturing facility. As per LMRC, all new trains will now be tested up to 98% at the place of manufacture before being sent to Lucknow. The remaining 2% trial will be done on the actual corridor by LMRC. 
 
 Managing director of LMRC, Kumar Keshav said, “Testing of trains on a 25KV track at the manufacturing plant will rule out possibility of glitches in the commercial run.” Keshav said, “All new trains will be pretested at Alstom’s manufacturing plant and we have suggested improvement to be incorporated in new trains.” 
 
 LMRC has reportedly asked the manufacturer to upgrade software of various subsystems for safety, traction, signalling, etc.
