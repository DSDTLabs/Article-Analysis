KERI: The recently concluded six-day field exercise of the All India   Estimation has confirmed the presence of the big cat in the   Wildlife Sanctuary. Forest officials have now launched the second phase of the tiger census by installing camera traps at various locations from May 7, an exercise that will continue till the end of the month.

 The Mhadei forest valley, which is contiguous between Goa and  , forms a part of the Bhimgad and Mhadei wildlife sanctuaries and has repeatedly indicated presence of tigers and black panthers through the camera trap technique used by the forest departments of both states.
 
 The census, which began on May 1, has found evidence like pugmarks, tiger scats and scratches. After sorting the field survey information, camera traps were installed inside the sanctuary. 
 
 Range forest officer ( ) Prakash Salelkar told TOI, “Last year, using camera traps, we got evidence of the presence of five tigers and four black panthers in the forests of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. During the present, census we found pugmarks and tiger scats and have accordingly installed camera traps in those areas.”
 
 The state’s forest department has been using camera traps to document behavioural patterns and movements of big cats within the Mhadei forest for the last two years after the technique was first implemented by former principal chief conservator of forests Richard D’Souza. 
 
 Wildlifer Vitthal Shelke, who participated in the tiger census, said, “Sighting of a herd of seven bisons and other herbivorous animals indicates that the area has a substantial prey base.”
 
 As per the 1997 and 2002 censuses, there were five tigers in the forests of Goa at the time. In 2013, then RFO of the Mhadei Sanctuary   was successful in collecting the first photographic evidence to prove the presence of tigers in the forest of  , which was confirmed by a team of wildlifers led by Ulhas Karanth.
