BENGALURU: After being delayed many times over, Phase 1 of the   is now inching towards completion but the government already appears to be contemplating another rail network for the city –  .

 Interestingly, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is likely to prepare the project report for the Surface Rail. “For a city like Bengaluru, the Metro network alone won’t suffice. We are planning to build a Surface Rail along the proposed   (PRR), so that the city has a circular train network. This will, in turn, be connected to the Metro at strategic points,” official sources told TOI.
 
 Sources in the urban development department said that the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) was likely to include the right of way for the rail network along the proposed route of the PRR. “The 65km-long PRR cuts through Sarjapur Road, Old Madras Road, Ballari Road and KR Puram. These points will be bookended by Hosur Road and Tumakuru Road. In order to provide a circular network, one half of the Surface Rail be built along the existing NICE Road, and the reminder on the PRR,” said a UDD official.
 
 The official pointed out that while the basic design, and the source of the train’s power won’t be too different, the Surface Rail would ride at a height of just 2m or 3m above the ground. “Underpasses or over bridges will be built to ease regular road traffic, where the Surface Rail passes,” he added.
 
 However, UDD sources said that the proposal was still on the drawing board. “To start with, we need to tackle all the challenges before going ahead with the PRR. By then, a detailed report on Surface Rail and its feasibility would be ready, and we could propose it to the government. It’s too early to talk about the cost,” the official said.
