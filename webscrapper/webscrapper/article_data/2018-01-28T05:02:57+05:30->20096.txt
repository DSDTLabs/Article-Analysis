The IIT-JEE (Advanced) will move to a fully   this year, with candidates having to type-in their answers on computers, much like it happens in the   (CAT) for  . The exam is scheduled to be held on May 20.

 Candidates will have to submit the papers on which they scribble their rough work.
 
 A major change this year concerns when two or more candidates have the same score. In that case, the student with least negative marks (given for wrong answers) will rank higher than others with the same score but with more wrong answers. If there is a tie even then, the marks in maths, and then physics, will be considered.
 
 The decision to switch over to a computer-based exam follows the observation that an overwhelming majority of students who clear the first round, IIT-JEE (Main), are exposed to computers either at school or their coaching centres.
 
 The shift to computers will give candidates the option of seeing a question in Hindi or English. Candidates will be able to switch between English and Hindi during the test. 
 
 In another change, examinees can answer any question but still mark it for review if they think there is something amiss; the answer will be considered for evaluation even if there is nothing wrong with the question. “Also, examinees do not need to worry if there is a computer malfunction,” the official told TOI. “Alternative computers will be provided and every student will get the full three hours,” a senior   official said.
 
 The registration fee has been increased by Rs 200 for all candidates, except girls and reserved-category students, from last year’s Rs 2,400.
