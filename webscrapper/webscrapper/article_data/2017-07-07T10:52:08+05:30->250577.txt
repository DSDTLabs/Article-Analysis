BENGALURU: Thousands of commuters across the city, who arrived at various Metro stations to catch their trains to various destinations were welcomed by shut doors on Friday morning. Metro operations, which were supposed to start at 5 am, have remained non-starter in the wake of protest undertaken by   (BMRCL) staff. 

 Speaking to TOI, UA Vasanth Rao, chief public relations officer, BMRCL said there was a tussle between their staff and Karnataka State Industrial Security Force personnel on Thursday following which few staff members have been arrested. "Metro staff are demanding release of their colleagues and decided not to attend work until then. We are trying to resolve the issue and resume train operations as early as possible," he added. 
  
  Metro staff on the other hand are staging a protest at Byappanahalli metro station in East Bengaluru and their colleagues are supporting them by not attending the work.
  
 As a routine, first train operations from all four directions, namely Byappanahalli, Nagasandra, Mysuru Road and Yelachenahalli start at 5am. Around 3 lakh commuters are dependent on   network spread across 42kms in the city.
