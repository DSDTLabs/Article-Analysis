VISAKHAPATNAM: The   (MEA) and department of posts (DOP) have announced that post office passport seva kendras (POPSKs) will start functioning from the head post offices at Kurnool and Kadapa soon, said Visakhapatnam passport officer   in a release on Friday. A POPSK will also be set up at Nellore, he added.

 Choudary said the new POPSKs will benefit the people of Kurnool, Kadapa, Nellore and Anantapur as at present, they need not travel all the way to Vizag, Vijayawada or Tirupathi for their passport needs. Once these POPSKs become fully functional, at least 200 appointments will be released daily, the release added.
 
 The passport officer further said following the liberalisation of passport policies on December 23 last year, there has been a 30 per cent surge in demand for passports. "We expect that these additional POPSK will help the citizens in easily getting passports," he added.
