GANDHINAGAR: The ruling  , which recorded a dismal performance in rural   in the 2017 assembly elections, has proposed a major change in the   (APMC) Act to allow the committees to engage in large-scale contract farming and to start farm product value-addition industrial units. The state cabinet, led by chief minister  , approved a primary draft bill to amend the APMC Act. The amendment will be introduced in the assembly session starting from February 19.

  
  “The state cabinet has approved the amendment to allow APMCs to engage in contract farming, build cold storages, godowns, and to sort, grade, and process produce,” said a key source aware of the development. “Private sector companies have been allowed to engage in contract farming since 2007 in Gujarat. However, few companies do that.” The source said it has been observed that farmers are more comfortable dealing with the APMCs than with companies. 
 
 “To improve the quality of the yield in the state as well as to avoid the current crisis-like situation, the government has decided to empower the APMCs by enabling them to adopt the farm-to-finished-product approach,” the source said. “The state and central governments have several schemes for cold storages, godowns, food processing units, and exports. So engaging the APMCs will help in the improving the quality of farming and in ensuring the best possible prices to farmers. Direct and indirect employment will also be generated.” The source said that the APMCs are financially sound and have technical capabilities too. “The move will help balance the yield and prevent excessive production and price falls,” he said. R C Faldu, the state agriculture minister, did not offer a comment.
