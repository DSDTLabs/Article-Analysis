BATHINDA: With Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh’s movie ‘MSG Lion Heart-2: Hind Ka Napak Ko Jawab’ releasing on Friday, a Sikh high priest appealed to members of the community to refrain from watching the movie.

 Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar Giani Gurmukh Singh, however, stopped short of calling for a boycott of the film. “Sikhs are least concerned about the film. I am sure they will follow the edict issued in May 2007 about severing ties with the dera head. It is the followers of dera who may go to theatres,” he said.
 
 He added that they would not give a boycott call. “Sikhs will ensure a self-imposed ban,” he said.
 
 In spite of the appeal, several followers of the Sirsa-headquartered sect thronged theatres on the first day of the movie. The film has been released at a time when the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, Akal Takht, has taken serious view of Sikh candidates cutting across party lines reaching the dera’s headquarters in Sirsa to seek support ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab. Dera’s political wing on February 1 had announced support to the ruling SAD-BJP alliance in the Punjab polls.
 
 Religious preacher  , who was appointed as parallel ‘jathedar’ of Takht Damdama Sahib by the   in November 2015, said Sikhs did not want any kind association with the dera head.
 
 When contacted, dera’s political wing chairman   said people were showing interest in the film. “There is no controversy around it,” he said.
