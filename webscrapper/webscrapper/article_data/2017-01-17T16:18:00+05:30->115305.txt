Aamir Khan's Christmas release 'Dangal,' which also stars Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra and Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar in key roles, continued its dream run at the box-office on Day 11 as it added Rs 13.45 crore more to its kitty. The film's total collection now stands at an astounding figure of Rs 284.69 crore. 

 
 
 The drop from the first Monday when the film had collected Rs 25.48 crore is 47 percent, which is normal for a film running in its second week. The sports drama, co-written and directed by Nitesh Tiwari, continued its splendid performance in North India especially the circuits of Delhi, UP and East Punjab. 
 
 
 
 With the kind of business 'Dangal' has done so far, it is possible that the film will surpass the lifetime collections of Salman Khan-starrer 'Sultan', which had raked in Rs 300.45 crore at the domestic box-office. 'Sultan' currently enjoys the distinction of being the highest Bollywood grosser of 2016. 
 
 
 
 'Dangal' tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers. The film is enjoying a tax-free status in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.
