AHMEDABAD: A twenty-six-year old woman from Dariapur came in the line of fire on Friday when the city sessions court found out that she had got a   made to   her husband out from  .

  was compelled to withdraw the temporary bail application, which she had filed for her husband, Bhadreshkumar, who was jailed in May in connection with a murder case.
 
 Rathod furnished a document ostensibly issued by   stating that she is suffering from cancer, and her surgery is scheduled for July 18. She requested the court to release her husband temporarily so that he could be of some help during the time of her surgery.
 
 The prosecution verified the medical certificate and found that it was forged. The concerned department at VS Hospital confirmed that Rathod had come for consultation, but never complained of cancer. The doctors never wrote a prescription because there was no investigation on the line of treatment of cancer. In April, Gujarat high court directed the city crime branch to investigate a scam in which prisoners and their relatives supplied bogus medical documents to secure temporary bail. The HCâ€™s vigilance department found that this malpractice took place in 97 bail applications by six prisoners who supplied fake certificates in the name of VS Hospital and Civil Hospital. When the veracity was cross-checked, authorities said the documents supplied to the HC by the prisoners were not prepared by them.
