HYDERABAD: Latest government data shows that increasingly   are being abandoned in the city. 

 The Telangana State Child Rights Protection Forum (TSCRPF) says over the past six months over 43 newborns have been found abandoned, mostly in garbage bins, temples and hospitals. 
 
 "Out of them, 39 were girl children and four boys," said a senior official.
 
 Last year, about 50 children were found. This year, activists say the figure could be much higher. On an even more tragic note, in most instances, the children have been found dead this year.
 
 According to NGOs, families belonging to poor backgrounds and migrants from  , usually abandon their new-born babies in the city. In 90% of the cases, the girl child is the victim. The children who are found alive are shifted to   or Sishu Gruha.
 
 A senior official from women and child welfare department, Hyderabad, said that, since last year over 60 children who were abandoned have been shifted to state-run Sishu Gruha. "Thankfully, we have seen rise in adoption applications. The number of families who want to adopt a child, are far more than children currently in the state-run homes," said the official. 
 
 Telangana State Child Rights Protection Forum (TSCRPF) says gender sensitisation can bring cases down. "Thinking about dowry, families tend to abandon girl child," said  , an advisor to TSCRPF. "These cases are higher in  ," she said.
 
 Activists say the state government is not doing enough to bring about awareness about the cradle baby scheme. Under the scheme, if a family or a mother does not want to keep a baby, they can give them up for adoption.
