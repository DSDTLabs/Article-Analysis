CHANDIGARH:   Amarinder Singh has demanded immediate  , saying it had been "completely exposed in the   jail incident, where a known henchman of home minister   was caught holding a kangaroo court on Wednesday along with two dozen other Akali-linked criminals". 

 Amarinder demanded imposition of the President's rule to hold free and fair elections in the state. He alleged that the incident had thoroughly exposed the complicity of the Badals and their associates in the rampant crime mafia in the state. He also called for an independent probe by a central agency.
 
 "Given his close links with Sukhbir, the main culprit in the case, Shiv Lal Doda, was clearly acting as the former's henchman and holding a proxy meeting for the home minister in the jail when he was caught, along with about two dozen others known to have close links with the Akalis," said Amarinder. tnn
