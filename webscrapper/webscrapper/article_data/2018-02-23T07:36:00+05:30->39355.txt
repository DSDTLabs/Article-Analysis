Chandigarh: Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, on Thursday, urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to facilitate introduction of the Toronto-Amritsar Air Canada flight. 

 She also suggested to Trudeau that the Canadian government jointly celebrate the 550th Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, in association with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). 
 
 The Union minister made these suggestions on the sidelines of an India-Canada business session in New Delhi. She also invited Canadian companies to invest in the food processing sector in India. According to her, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector is on the rise. 
 
 Addressing the business session, Harsimrat said India and Canada had registered trade of 8 billion dollars in 2016. “The country received FDI worth 60 billion dollars in 2016-17 and even this is on the rise because of the vast uncapped potential of the food sector. India has a retail potential of 60 billion dollars, out of which 70% is in the food sector alone,” she said. The meeting was attended by Trudeau, Canadian ministers and representatives of CII and FICCI.
 
 The Union minister invited Canadian companies to invest in the food sector in India, saying that many steps have been taken to facilitate investors, including the launch of a food regulatory portal, a single interface for food businesses.
