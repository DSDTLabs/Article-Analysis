NEW DELHI: The sports ministry is all set to move a proposal to put “sports” in the   of the Constitution, which will pave the way for the Centre and state governments to work together for the development of sports in India.

 “Most of the states are in agreement with the proposal discussed at the conference of state sports ministers in November 2016,” said sports minister  , adding that only   was opposed to the move.   said, “The issue will be again taken up at the conference of state sports ministers scheduled for January 21.” He said the ministry will move a note to the   after seeking the opinion of states again.
 
 Earlier, a resolution was passed to transfer sports to the Concurrent List at a meeting of the national sports federations called by the government. Several expert panels and committees have argued for shifting of sports from its present Constitutional position where it is clubbed with “entertainment” and “amusement” under the State List to make it a key instrument of youth development and thereby for accelerated and inclusive national development.
