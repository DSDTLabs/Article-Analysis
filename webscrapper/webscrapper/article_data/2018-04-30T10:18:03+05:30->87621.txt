FEROZEPUR: A youth ended his life at   village under Zira subdivision of Ferozepur district on Sunday. Jatinder Singh (25) was allegedly upset over the pressure being put on his family to part with their 9 acre landholding. 

 In his complaint to police, the victim’s father   alleged that some political party leaders, with the help of police, had been pressurizing them to vacate the 9 acres of land which they were tilling for the last 70 years. The family, supported by other villagers and members of  , has refused to cremate the body unless police booked those responsible for Jatinder’s death.
 
 “Our opponents had managed to get Section 145 (procedure where dispute concerning land or water is likely to cause breach of peace) of the CrPC imposed on the disputed land. This incident upset Jatinder, who was under depression and ended his life by hanging himself,”   alleged.
 
 He claimed that they were legal occupants of the land and had revenue record to prove it. He alleged that some political leaders bought the land at throwaway prices and in order to get it vacated from his family’s possession, they managed to get Section 145 of CrPC imposed.
 
 On getting the information, a police team led by Ferozepur superintendent of police (investigations)   visited the spot and started investigation the matter.
