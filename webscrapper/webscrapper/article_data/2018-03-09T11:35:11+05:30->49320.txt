PANAJI: To promote menstrual hygiene, the ministry of labour and employment has decided to install sanitary   dispensing machines at government schools and small and micro industrial units. 

 The move will be implemented in three phases, beginning with multinational companies operating in the state. Named ‘Stri Sakhi’, the scheme will help improve hygiene among woman and prevent improper disposal of sanitary napkins, said an official. “Some companies have been asked to install vending machines and incinerators in their offices,” said labour and employment minister  . 
 
 In the second phase, dispensing units will be installed in small and micro scale industries where napkins will be dispensed at   1. “The labour welfare board will bear the expenditure of the machines, but periodic replenishment will be done by the employer,” Khaunte said. In the third phase, the board will identify schools and colleges, especially the ones which have underprivileged students. Here, the board will install and replenish the dispensing machines, the minister said. tnn
