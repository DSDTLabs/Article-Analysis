TERETPALLY:  , a 75-year-old farmer from  , wants water for both irrigation and drinking purposes. 

 He also wants a road between Teretpally and Velmakanne, which has been a dream of the villages for decades.
 
 BJP national president   visited Beerappa's house and interacted with him and his family members while kick-starting his house-to-house visit as part of the   and three-day visit to polling booths, villages and districts.
 
 After Amit Shah gave an eight page pamphlet highlighting the BJP government's achievements as well as the 'misdeeds' of the TRS government to Beerappa, the farmer told Shah that the major problem in the village is water. 
 
 "We do not have any water source for irrigation and for drinking purposes as the village is part of the fluoride-affected area." 
 
 The BJP president asked about his land holding in the village to which Beerappa said he owns about six acres. He said he purchases para grass for feeding his cattle from about 40 km by spending about 10,000 a tractor load. He also complained that his household does not have an individual latrine. In fact, no house in the village has an individual latrine, he added. 
 
 Another owner Yadaiah said the only irrigation source Charlagudem chervu near Shivannagudem should be filled so that the water can be used for both drinking and irrigation purposes. "As we cannot drink fluoride water, we buy water from the outside (mineral water)," Yadaiah's wife Padma told the BJP national president. 
 
 Though he offered buttermilk, Amit Shah gently refused it. Apart from these houses, Amit Shah interacted with 10 house owners. Since they spoke in Telugu, party state unit president Laxman translated the same into Hindi. Before leaving, the party chief pasted on the door a sticker with quotes of Deendayal Upadyay saying 'Let us not repeat the mistake of what happened in 1948.
 
 Earlier, party workers gave Shah a grand reception at   and at the places he halted.
