Coimbatore: The city police on Wednesday detained seven people for indulging in clashes at Hilaricas 2018, the annual cultural fest of the Hindusthan College of Arts and Science in the city. A police inspector (law and order) identified them as alumni of the college, who had visited the cultural festival and picked up a quarrel with the students. Sources said such incidents have been happening in the college’s cultural fest for the last few years. A college official, however, denied the occurrence of any such incident. “The fest has been organised in an orderly and peaceful manner. No untoward incidents happened,” the official said. Hilaricas is an annual cultural fest of the Hindusthan College of Arts and Science, which has several events such as music, dance and quiz. The college usually invites film stars and celebrities to the event. The seven were booked under Section 75(1) of the Madras City Police Act.  TNN
