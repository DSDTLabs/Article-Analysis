NEW DELHI: Following Congress president 
  today that the country is “tired” under the   government, a leader from the saffron party hit back saying it is the Congress that is tired and not India.

 
 "Mr  , the nation is not tired, it's the congress party that is tired and on a downward spiral. The nation is on a path of resurgence & towards building a #NewIndia," Hussain said in a tweet.
 
 
  
  
 
  Earlier today, while addressing his first plenary session of the Congress as party president, Rahul said that the “hate-driven”, “divisive” politics of the BJP government at the Centre has left the country “tired” and lost.
 
 "The country is tired, it’s looking for a way, and I say from my heart that only the Congress can show India the way. The difference between the Congress and the Opposition (BJP), the big difference, is they use anger, we use love and regard for our fellow humans," said Rahul in his first address to a Congress plenary since becoming party president.
