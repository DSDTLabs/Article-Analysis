NEW DELHI: Days after US President  's announced immigration order against people from seven Muslim-majority countries, the official social network account Twitter on Sunday reacted against the executive order.

 "Twitter is built by immigrants of all religions. We stand for and with them, always," the company wrote in its social network.
 
  
  Twitter's comment comes after a series of protests at airports as it bars US citizens from Iraq,  ,  ,  , Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
 
 The executive order also makes clear those seven countries are just a starting point for a likely broader ban. The order though exempts diplomats and members of international organisations from the ban.
 
 However, a federal judge, on Saturday, temporarily blocked part of President Donald Trump's sloppily-implemented executive order. The judge subsequently ordered that the detained immigrants not be deported.
