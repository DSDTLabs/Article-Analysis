Coimbatore: The city police on Saturday rescued a 38-year-old man,  . Police also arrested four people in connection with the incident.

 Police sources identified the man as P Rameshkumar of Subbammal Layout First Street at KK Pudur in Saibaba Colony, who was a rice trader on Variety Hall road. “His friends Santhoshkumar from Cheran Maa Nagar and Sathish were running a travel agency. A few months ago, Santhoshkumar had cheated a car owner in Saravanampatti by pledging his car for lakhs of rupees. After Rameshkumar informed him, the car owner filed a police case against Santhoshkumar. After Rameshkumar suffered losses in business, a Chennai-based rice seller lodged a complaint against him before the crime branch, who registered a case. In order to evade arrest, Rameshkumar requested Santhoshkumar to find a hiding place. Santhosh told him to stay at his second wife’s house at Cheran Maa Nagar for a few days. Rameshkumar, who stayed there, allegedly spread rumours about Santhosh’s second wife. This prompted Santhoshkumar and Sathish to take revenge,” a police officer said.
 
 On the night of February 16, Sathish requested Rameshkumar to accompany him to Pollachi. Santhosh, Sathish and Rameshkumar started the journey in a car to Pollachi. One of their friends Karthi also joined them. They went to a coconut farm near Kottur in Pollachi where Santhosh, Sathish, Karthi and Bharathi, a relative of Santhosh, beat up Rameshkumar. Santhosh demanded a ransom of Rs 50,000 from Rameshkumar and contacted some of Rameshkumar’s friends for the money. The friends alerted Peelamedu police.TNN
