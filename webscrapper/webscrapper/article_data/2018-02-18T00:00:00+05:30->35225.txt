Love stories involving more than just two people are nothing new in Kannada cinema. Either two guys fall in love with the same girl, with one sacrificing his feelings for the other willingly or after putting up a fight for it, or two girls pine for the same guy. We’ve seen it all.
In his new film,  , director   Muthalageri is presenting this theme, albeit with a twist. “Rangbirangi is about four guys from different strata of society, played by newcomers Srijith KN, Panchakshri Panchi (Panchu), Charan Subbaiah and  , who come across a girl ( ) and are smitten. The film revolves around how having her in their lives changes each of them. While it is interesting to see who eventually gets her, what is different is that we have put together four guys who do not know each other in the film. Unlike most notable romances in which friends tend to have feelings for the same person, we have protagonists who not only do not know each other, but are also unaware of the fact that the others are also after the same girl,” says Mallikarjun.
 The idea, he adds, came to him when he was in college and came across friends who fancied a particular girl, but did not know each other. “It was funny how different guys would talk to me about how they liked this one particular girl. I have taken inspiration from this and, in that sense, Rangbirangi is a true story,” he says.
