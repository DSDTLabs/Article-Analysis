Nagpur: A cosmic treat awaits   on Wednesday evening, with a three-in-one lunar spectacle starting around sunset. City stargazers will witness a blue moon (second full moon in a calendar month), a total lunar eclipse (or blood moon), and a super moon on the same day. All three occurring on the same say is a rare occurrence, last seen in 1983 from certain countries. For some countries, this spectacle will be visible after 150 years.

 To view this cosmic rarity, all one requires is a clear sky.  , planetarium officer at   (RSC), said, “You do not require a telescope to see this as everything will be visible to the human eye. We have made special arrangements at   so that stargazers can see not only the eclipse, but also get a briefing by officials.” To be part of the ‘guided tour’ of the super moon-blood moon-blue moon, you have to register in advance with RSC.
 
 During the early evening hours of January 31, there will be a full moon, a total lunar eclipse, a blue moon and a supermoon — all at the same time. None of these things is really all that unusual by itself. What is rare is that they're happening all together on one day.
 
 Wagh said, “It will be a visual treat for everyone. During this programme visitors will have an opportunity to enjoy the lunar eclipse. The visitors will be taken to the actual observation of the eclipse through 11 inches   telescope.”
 
 The old English saying ‘once in a blue moon’ still cannot do justice to the rarity of the event. If Nagpurians miss a chance to view it on Wednesday evening, the next possible occurrence will be about 20 years later.
