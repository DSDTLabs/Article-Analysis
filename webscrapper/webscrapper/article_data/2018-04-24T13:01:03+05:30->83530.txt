HYDERABAD: Despite the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi(TRS) leaders and MLAs making a plea to chief minister   not to hold gram panchayat (GP) polls now and conduct them after the 2019 elections, the government appears to be firm. 

 Housing minister A   told TOI that the elections to GPs will be held as per schedule. The term of the elected bodies of GPs will end in July and elections would be conducted as per the provisions of the Constitution. 
 
 "The   will decide the schedule," he said.
 
 In fact, ministers are learnt to have told the party leaders and MLAs not to worry as the party leadership will take care of their concerns. 
 
 Almost all the ministers are of the view that GP elections should be used as an opportunity to decimate   and other opposition parties-supported candidates and herald a TRS wave in the 2019 polls. Though GP elections are fought on a non-party basis (not on political party symbols), it is the political parties which decide the candidates, support and finance them unofficially to enter the fray in the GP polls.
 
 The leaders and MLAs had expressed their apprehensions that GP elections may result in formation of groups and those not getting party support could work against the TRS in the general elections. Also, they felt it would be a huge financial burden on them if GP elections are held now as they will have to spend again during the general elections.
 
 In every village, there are several aspirants from TRS vying for tickets and the party leadership has to accommodate them. 3Though the scope of this negative impact would be there on the opposition parties as well, it is the ruling TRS which stands the threat of taking most of the impact due to its "operation akarsh" as part of which it has wooed a large number of leaders from other parties into the TRS fold.
