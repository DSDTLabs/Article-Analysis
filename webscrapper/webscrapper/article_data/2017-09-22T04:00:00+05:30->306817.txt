Vadodara: Post-graduate students of art history department of fine arts faculty of M S University (MSU) had a brush with practical learning in curatorial practice under a project named Magic of Making.

 Around 18 students of the department participated in the project of curating which is one of the modules of their course. “The idea behind the project was to make the students understand the role of a curator – how to develop ideas, to activate the space with meaning,” said Johny M L, visiting faculty at the department and project guide.
 
 Before the curated works were displayed at the faculty, participating students were made to sit and debate on the planning. Johny said that the students had to write the concept note, curatorial note, decide on funding and budget, take official permissions, reach out to public and media and final execution. The exhibition will continue till Friday.
