LUCKNOW: Two prime projects in   (JPNIC) and   - did not get vistors' attention at the Investors Summit. The projects were launched by the   during the previous Akhilesh regime. 

 LDA was hoping to find investors who could operate and maintain JPNIC. The Authority had opened both options - long-term lease or sale. For CG City, LDA had developed the infrastructure and created several commercial and mixed land-use plots for sale. But no one showed interest in them. 
 
  
 LDA had showcased eight projects at the summit. Other projects which too evoked a dull response were indoor sports complex on   and Basant Kunj Yojna on   bypass. Despite being in the vicinity of the International Cricket Stadium, IIIT and Shaan-e-Avadh complex, LDA failed to get buyers for CG City's commercial plots.
 
 JPNIC comprises 3 parts - museum on JP's life; convention block with 2,000 seating capacity, Olympics size swimming pool and multi-sports facility; and seven-floor multilevel car parking block. A senior official of LDA said, "It is difficult to run this huge property through our resources. We need private partners for it but no serious buyer come forward in the summit."
