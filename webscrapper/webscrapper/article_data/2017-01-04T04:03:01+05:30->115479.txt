An insurance company cannot be held liable for deficient service when its policy agreement clearly excludes certain physical conditions from the reimbursement of medical expenses, ruled a  . 

 A bench of V P Utpat and Kshitija Kulkarni rejected the complaint by a   (name withheld) who alleged that   wrongfully rejected her claims against expenses incurred on surgery for morbid obesity. The company had resisted the complaint arguing that repudiation of her claim was based on a specific clause in the policy agreement that excluded morbid obesity from the reimbursement list.
 
 The complainant had subscribed to the company’s   insurance policy for the period between March 1, 2012, and February 28, 2013, by paying a one-time premium of Rs 17,880 for Rs 5 lakh insurance cover. In October 2012, she was admitted to a private hospital for hernia and obesity surgeries and incurred total expenses of Rs 5.8 lakh. Later, when she submitted her claim, the company sanctioned surgery expenses of Rs 2.07 lakh for hernia, rejecting claim amount for obesity reduction. It informed the complainant that morbid obesity was excluded from the cover given by the policy.
 
 The complainant argued before the consumer court that her case was not that of a cosmetic surgery and that she was required to undergo surgery for hernia due to obesity and both health issues were connected. Obesity itself is a disease and the insurance company ought to have reimbursed the claim, she added.
 
 But the bench referred to the specific clause and observed, “It is clear from the said clause that the expenses incurred for the surgery of obesity are excluded. The complainant was aware about the contents of the policy and she had entered into contract of insurance knowing she is not entitled for the same.”
