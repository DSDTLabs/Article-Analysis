HYDERABAD: Tipplers are flooding the ‘Liquor Price’ app released on Saturday by the   excise department with complaints of Maximum Retail Price ( ) violations by liquor shops.

 According to excise department officials, on Sunday alone, 659 complaints were received from across the state, including Hyderabad. Most of the complainants alleged that the shops are collecting Rs10 to Rs20 above the Maximum Retail Price on each bottle.
 
 
 Excise Enforcement Director   told  , “The response has been tremendous. On Sunday, more than 5,000 people downloaded the app on their mobile phones and started complaining. We are verifying the complaints. In many cases, complainants uploaded pictures. Our teams will do fact-finding and take action accordingly.”
 
 In Telangana, there are around 2,216 liquor shops. According to the act, erring shops will be shut down for seven days and also attract a fine of Rs2 lakh to Rs2.5 lakh.
 
 Akun Sabharwal added, “We have to check the complaints properly as there is all likelihood of competitors in liquor trade filing false complaints against each other. The act has been amended and two CCTV cameras are fixed at each shop so that it is easy to detect any wrongdoing.”
 
 The excise department is hoping that Maximum Retail Price violations will come down due to the availability of the liquor price app.
 
  president   told TOI, “Some dealers violate Maximum Retail Price rule. However, currently, the situation is that government is selling us the old stock with old labels, which show old Maximum Retail Price despite the liquor prices having been hiked overnight in December last week. Most of the complaints would be that the customer is not aware of the price hike and checking on the label instead in the app. Why would any wine dealer risk a big fine and closure for a week just by making Rs10 to Rs15 on the side.”
