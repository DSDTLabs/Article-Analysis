CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will launch a campaign to reach out to its disgruntled and demoralised volunteers and local leaders in the state to strengthen the party. Delhi deputy chief minister and in-charge of   affairs Manish   will also hold one to one meetings with state leaders.

 During a meeting held on Friday, party leaders decided to go ahead with expansion plans, which would include strengthening of the party cadre up to booth level units and adding to various wings of the party. Several party wings have been headless for some time.
 
 A resolution to welcome Sisodia’s appointment was passed at the meeting. Sisodia has replaced the party’s   MP Sanjay Singh, who resigned after assembly elections. The alleged vindictive politics by the   government against AAP leaders was also discussed.
 
 Sisodia, who was expected to attend the meeting, did not turn up. Talking to reporters before the meeting, Punjab AAP president Bhagwant Mann said the party leadership was dismayed at the way the Congress had rolled out the farm debt waiver scheme.
 
 Asked about the letter written by party legislator   expressing displeasure at three Rajya Sabha nominations by the party, Mann said it was an internal matter of the party. He said booth level workers play an instrumental role in taking the voter to the polling station and this link should be strengthened. Party leader   said remaining appointments in the party’s state structure will be made soon.
