COIMBATORE:   president Amit Shah will visit the city on March 21 to participate in the closing ceremony of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) annual general body meeting, the first to be held in Tamil Nadu. He will be accompanied by the Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, party sources said.

 “Since its inception in 1925, this will be the first time that the organisation’s AGM will be held in Tamil Nadu. It will be held at   between March 19 and 21,” state deputy leader for RSS’ media relations, R Suryanarayanan, told TOI.
 
 Asked if the meeting is being organised keeping in mind the political scenario in Tamil Nadu, Suryanarayanan said, “This has got nothing to do with the political situation. The decision to organise the meeting was taken in the previous meeting.” 
 
 RSS, BJP’s ideological parent, plans to strengthen its base in Tamil Nadu, he said. “We have 400 full-time volunteers in Tamil Nadu. We plan to increase the volunteers strength, reach out to all the villages in Tamil Nadu and spread RSS ideology,” Suryanarayanan said.
 
 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and national general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi will inaugurate the meeting. “On the second day, we will discuss key social and national issues and resolutions will be passed based on the discussions,” Suryanarayanan said.
 
 A total of 1,500 members are expected to attend the meeting. “For every 2,000 members of RSS, a representative has been elected to take part in the meeting. Also, members of RSS and its constituent organisations – BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and   - will participate,” said Suryanaryanan.
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior BJP leader LK Advani had visited the city last month to attend Maha Shivaratri celebrations conducted at at Isha Foundation.
