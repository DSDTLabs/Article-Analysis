The number, which features in  's upcoming film, Ticket, revolves around death rendering a love song to the protagonist.  , who has directed and acted in this film, explains, ' The subject of mortality has always fascinated me. The film revolves around a guy, who is dying on that particular day. Navneet Sundar, the music director of the film, had composed a song for a situation that involved the protagonist coming to terms with death approaching him.   first suggested we work on a quirky play of words.
