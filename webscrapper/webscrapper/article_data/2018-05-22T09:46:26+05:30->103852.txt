PUNE: The Pune Rural police on Sunday arrested Sukhraj   (40) for the murder of his 70-year-old father.

 On May 7, 70-year-old Dagadu Temgire was found dead inside his room at an ashram in   village in Purandar taluka. 
 
 Sukhraj had bludgeoned his father to death as the latter was not ready to sell his farm.
 
 A crime branch officer said Sukhraj is an alcoholic and frequently harassed his father for money. “Sukharaj wanted to sell their farm, which was in his father’s name. He had even taken an advance payment from someone for the farm. When Temgire refused to sell the farm, Sukhraj decided to kill him,” he said.
 
 Temgire was a devotee of the ashram, which located close to   temple. “On May 6, Temgire was taking rest in the ashram when Sukhraj bludgeoned him to death with an iron rod,” the officer said. “He locked the room from the outside and left the ashram,” the officer said.
 
 “When we heard about the rift, we brought Sukhraj in for questioning. Under sustained interrogation, he confessed to the murder,” the officer said.
