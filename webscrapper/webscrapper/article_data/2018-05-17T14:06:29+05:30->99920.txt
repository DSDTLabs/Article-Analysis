COLVA: All eyes in   are on the   shed at the South Goa Planning and Development Authority market complex. Will it be ready in 15 days, as promised by town and country planning minister  , is the question on most lips. 

 While a lot of work on the shed is still pending, SGPDA member secretary   sounded optimistic. “It should be completed by May 31, or there might be a little delay,” he said. 
 
 After much delay, the work of the renovation of the shed was taken up in March this year, at a cost of Rs 1.24 crore. The renovation was long required, as the shed was in a pathetic condition with clogged drains and unbearable stench. To make matters worse, vendors encroached upon the path, making it very difficult for customers to walk through the market. They squatted on the pathway to protest the illegal sale of fish by migrants in the wholesale market, which was affecting their business. 
 
 Then,  , who is also the local  , said that he would put an end to the illegal sale of fish and renovate the shed to make it the best in the country. Following this, vendors cooperated with him and cleared the pathway. Sardesai promised them better flooring, independent meters, water supply, ice storage facility, and   cameras. 
 
 A visit to the shed indicated that a lot more has to be done to meet the deadline of May 31. While a few people were at work there, it didn’t look like it would be ready by May 31. A source who is involved in the renovation, while hoping to meet the deadline, said, “you know how government contractors are, but we are pushing”.
