BENGALURU: The   government has decided to crack the whip against as many as 688 doctors, who skipped the one-year mandatory government service. The government on Saturday said that legal action would be initiated against 661 specialist doctors and 27 MBBS graduates for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement they signed at the time of admission.

 Saying the acute shortage of postgraduate doctors necessitated compulsory service by students who opted for government seats, health minister   said, “I have asked the   (KMC) to initiate disciplinary action against the 668 doctors for violating the code of medical ethics.“ The   has been asked to serve these doctors show-cause notice. “They will have to explain why their registration should not be cancelled,“ said Ramesh Kumar.
 
 Principal secretary for the health and family welfare department   said, “Specialist doctors have to work at taluk hospitals and community health centres operated by the government for one year, as per the agreement.But they have been ignoring reminders we have sent to them, as a result of which legal action has been initiated.“
 
 
 
 
 Most of us are familiar with the principle of service underpinning the Hippocratic Oath that all physicians swear before embarking on their career as doctors. However, in an age when all professions are being increasingly driven by market forces, it is important that doctors, who hold the lives of people in their hands, do not lose sight of humane values. Rural healthcare in India is a persistent concern, and the mandatory service stipulated in admission agreements is largely an attempt by the government to address this problem. Although it's easy to dismiss the predicament of doctors as a legal problem, it's the underlying principle that must concern all citizens -the society's willingness to compromise ethics in its pursuit of commercial interests.
