CHANDIGARH: City-based architects held a meeting here on Saturday to discuss challenges being faced in getting building plans. 

 After toiling hard for over one year, the Chandigarh administration on February 8 launched its ambitious   approval system. Even after two weeks, the architects said only three plans had been submitted.
 
 Under the new system, all the plans would be automatically scrutinised of drawings vis-a-vis building bylaws. The system would help in expediting the scrutiny process by eliminating lengthy and cumbersome manual processes.
 
 Under the new system, it would be possible to submit applications to get building plans sanctioned online from anywhere. The system would also enable the applicants to track the status of their applications through SMS, email alerts and MIS reports. The system would also act as an interface for overall monitoring.
 
 Architect  , who is also the president of the  , rued that the staff of the building branch is creating hurdles.
 
 "The system is not working smoothly and architects are facing a lot of problems," said Mukherjee.
 
 "The authorities should fix the bugs to ensure that the system works perfectly," he added.
 
 The architects also discussed delays in sanctioning of plans that were submitted before the launch of the online system. 
 
 "Many plans of commercial buildings are on hold since self-certification was made mandatory in July last year," they pointed out.
 
 Meanwhile, the architects also raised the issue of labour cess being charged by the administration. "The UT administration has increased the fee by manifolds under the new self-certification scheme," they said.
