MUMBAI: While there has been no breakthrough in the   of a police inspector’s 21-year-old son at  , investigators are awaiting the forensic lab reports to confirm if he was  . The youth had attended a birthday bash of a Marathi film producer’s daughter at a bungalow in   on May 7 night. His father found his body near a lake, 500m away from the bungalow, on May 9. 

 
 The crime branch began a probe into the case from Friday, after the youth’s father expressed dissatisfaction with the Aarey police’s investigation and said his son had been ragged and sexually assaulted. The postmortem report had stated that the youth’s body had lacerations on his private parts. According to sources, the police were unable to gather much evidence from the bungalow as it was cleaned up by the caretakers by the time the murder was reported to them. 
 
 Officers recovered footage from four cameras inside the bungalow, but they couldn’t find remnants from the party. A bedsheet was among the few objects seized and sent for forensic examination.   cameras in a housing society and two villas in Royal Palms captured the youth’s journey for 14 minutes after he exited the party. At 7.19am, the youth and his female friend were captured on camera at a locked-up gate outside the venue. It is presumed that he hopped over this gate, while she returned to the party. At 7.23am, the youth was captured on cameras at a nearby housing society as he tried to catch a ride home unsuccessfully. 
 
 At 7.29 am, cameras mounted on a villa near the society captured the youth. Till now, no injuries are seen on him. There is a steep, uneven route to reach the lake from this villa. At 7.33am, cameras on the rear side of another villa captured the youth at the lake; he had facial injuries. The staffers at this villa noticed the youth as he vomited, but didn’t go to his aid.
