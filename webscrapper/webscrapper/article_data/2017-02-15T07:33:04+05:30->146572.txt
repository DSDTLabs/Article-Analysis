KOLKATA: An   call made to a former   from a lodge in Muchipara has allegedly sent the   in a tizzy.

 Deputy commissioner of police (central division) Akhilesh Chaturvedi said, an employee of Muchipara Lodge claimed that he heard a man making an extortion call from one of their rooms.
 
 The room was booked under the name of   from Bihar, with a voter ID card, but apparently the document was fake, the officer said.
 
 “The room was locked and its occupant did not return for several hours. We forced open the door and recovered a laptop and a mobile. When we called the last dialled number, former Bihar MP D P Yadav answered and said he received a threat call from the same number. The caller said he would leak a fake sting footage featuring the MP unless he paid Rs 5 crore,” said Chaturvedi.
 
 The cops found several footages after scanning the laptop. One of them shows a man who resembles Matthew Samuel, CEO of Narada News. Chaturvedi, however, did not clarify if they suspect Samuel to be responsible for the call.
