LUCKNOW: The nuisance of stray cattle and dairies in residential colonies continues as   has put on hold the drive against them till either UP Housing & Development Board or   identifies land on the outskirts for their relocation. The government has directed the municipal corporation to remove dairies and stray cattle from city limits but citizens continue to suffer. Over the past two weeks, residents of several colonies have complained against illegal dairies giving rise to pollution and  . Irked by the inaction, around 100 residents of Priyadarshini ward in Indiranagar staged a protest on Monday demanding immediate removal of dairies.

 Shivajipuram resident Piyush Singh said, “In one month, my father and son were infected with dengue because of a dairy near my house. Cow dung clogs dra ins and sludge overflows as mosquitoes proliferate.“ Vasant Vihar resident Dileep K Gupta is unable to shift to his newly bought house because of several dairies operating around it.
 
 “I will stay in rented accommodation till LMC removes the dairies.“ Sector M, Aashiana resident Rahul Chaudhary said, “Because of dairies, roads remain littered and vacant plots are all occupied illegally . A mix of fodder and dung chokes drains and causes waterlogging." Similar is the predicament of residents of Vikasnagar, Triveninagar and Gomtinagar Extension.
 
 LMC's veterinary officer Arvind K Rao said, “According to HC orders, we have to relocate dairies for which we need help from LDA or housing board. Despite inept support from police to conduct drives, we are constantly catching stray cattle."

 The decision to put cattle catching drive on hold has again exposed lack of coordination between civic agencies. LMC with LDA and Housing Board could have planned in advance for relocation of dairies. Even if dairies are relocated, the problem of stray cattle will continue till LMC finds space for them in cow shelter. LMC needs to find a quick solution to these problems.
