TIRUNELVELI: Tireless efforts by scientists of the   ( ) helped spot the   – 6A, whose signal link got snapped shortly after its launch from Sriharikota on March 29, chairman of the space agency, K Sivan said. He also said that efforts are underway to re-establish communication with the satellite.

 Sivan was talking to reporters here on Sunday after laying the foundation stone for the satellite data receiving station on the land owned by INS Kattabomman opposite the regional centre of Anna University of Technology in   taluk of Tirunelveli. “The Rs 83-crore project would be completed in a year,” he said.
 
 Sivan said that Isro has signal receiving stations across India but the one in Tirunelveli will be a major station in  . He also said that upon commencing operations the station will help Isro receive quality signals when satellites move from the south to the north and create job opportunities as well.
 
 Talking about GSAT – 6A, he said that disconnection of communication with satellites for a short time is not uncommon. Stating that it happens due to radiation or electromagnetic disturbances, he added that communication is re-established when the launch vehicle’s engine is fired three or four times to take the satellite to its pre-determined path.
 
 Now that GSAT – 6A has been located, he expressed confidence that their team would soon establish communication with the satellite. Sivan also said that they are working on launching GSAT – 29 with GSLC Mk III D-2 into the orbit, to ensure faster data communication.
 
 About Chandrayaan-II, he said is it progressing well and would be launched on a full moon day this October.
