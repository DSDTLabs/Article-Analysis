PANAJI: The Cuncolim revolt, the Pinto conspiracy, the Opinion Poll and the history of the establishment of the Goa legislative assembly are be some of the eight topics that will soon be included in Class IX history textbooks for the first time. Inclusion of these crucial parts of Goa’s contemporary history in the school syllabus has been a long-standing demand of various groups in the state. 

 
 Chairperson of   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Ramkrishna   said the new content will be added to textbooks only in 2019-20. Given that the topics are of sentimental value to Goa, the board wants to vet the content well before introducing it, Samant said.
 
 “At present, only a small chapter exists on Goa’s history, freedom struggle and liberation. The new content will be more detailed one, including the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, history of Goa’s freedom struggle, Operation Vijay, and the history of Goa attaining statehood,” Samant said.
 
 The board has formed a committee of prominent historians and academics comprising Varsha Kamat, Celsa Pinto, Seema Risbud, Prajal Sakhardande, Luisa Pereira and   to frame the new content.
 
 “Once the content is drafted, it will be placed before the board of studies for its approval, following which the academic council of Goa Board has to give its nod. Only the will the topics be included in the syllabus,” Samant said.
 
 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar had said that the Opinion Pollwould be included in school textbooks. This triggered the Goa Board to begin framing new content on Goa’s recent history. It was decided to also include content on other crucial chapters of the state’s history as well.
