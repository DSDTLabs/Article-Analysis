Sources said the bus was going from Pokhrama in Biraul to Laheriasarai, both in Darbhanga district.

He said Mukesh was the co-driver of the bus and the other three were passengers. “The age of Laddu and Shakur were yet to be ascertained,” he said.
 
 “Mukesh was from Shankar Lohar and Dinesh belonged to Havadih village under the Baheri police station area while Laddu and Shakur were residents of Lohni village under the Biraul police station area,” the CO said.
 
 He said an ex gratia payment of Rs4 lakh was made to the next of kin of Mukesh and Dinesh while documentation process was on for the other two deceased.
 
 He said 11 passengers were undergoing treatment at Baheri primary health centre (PHC) while 22 injured were admitted to DMCH.
