NEW DELHI: As the   government enters its last full year, the foreign office is focusing on faster implementation of the development projects committed by India, particularly in neighbourhood countries. With this in mind, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale, has called back India’s ambassador to  , Vikram Doraiswami, to take charge of the drive to finish as many projects as possible. 

 
 The push towards implementation within the foreign office is also intended to address the growing complaints about India’s delays in delivery — China manages to do these projects in time and with a greater degree of sophistication.The budget earmarked for the effort is Rs 5,148.55 crore for 2018-19. On top of the list are infrastructure and connectivity projects in Bangladesh, which will be going for elections later this year. 
 
 Other crucial projects are slated for Nepal (which PM will visit on May 11) besides   and Maldives, often described as trouble spots for different reasons. Bangladesh is the recipient of the largest Indian development spending at $8 billion (approximately Rs 53.4 crore). In Nepal, India is building projects worth $1.65 billion (approximately Rs 1200 crore)
