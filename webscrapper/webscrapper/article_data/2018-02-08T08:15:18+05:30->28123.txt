NEW DELHI: Replying to the debate in the   on the Motion of Thanks for the President's address, PM Modi was particularly scathing on   and other opposition parties for opposing the  , saying a strange argument is being put forward that men of a certain community will go to jail and this will hurt their families. He said, Hindu men too go to jail for offenses and there might be some discomfort for that reason. 

  He also blamed Congress for delaying the bill to accord constitutional status to the OBC Commission."Look at what all you mocked - Swachh Bharat, Make in India, surgical strikes, Yoga Day. You are free to mock as you please but why are you blocking the bill for OBC Commission? Why are you blocking   Bill. Are you not sensitive to the aspirations of OBCs," he asked. 
 
  The Prime Minister also called for a "constructive discussion" on holding of simultaneous elections to the   and the state assemblies for the greater good of the country. He also sought suggestions from all parties for his government's new healthcare programme 'Ayushman Bharat'.
