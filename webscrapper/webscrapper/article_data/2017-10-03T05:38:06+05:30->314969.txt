PANAJI: In what seems to be a case of violation at the   bus stand in Panaji that turned it into a tinderbox as open space was turned into a supermarket, two shops and one small worship place. And with the electrical wiring haven’t been changed since 1982, it was a fit case for a spark to turn into an inferno.

 Till 1995, the central part of the   was an open passage for the commuters to cross from north to south and from east to west. But the KTC to make a quick buck, decided to convert the open space into commercial space—two shops and a supermarket. 
 
 The result of this was that the fire fighters found it difficult to even enter the supermarket, from where the fire started.
 
  “We will order an inquiry to find out how the access was blocked and the open space was turned into a commercial space,” KTC chairman Carlos Almeida told TOI.
 
 To make matters worse, the KTC did not even have a structural plan with them. The fire force had sought the structural plan from the KTC so that they could move inside the store quickly. “We don’t have an original plan with us,” Almeida said.
 
 The KTC chairman also tried to point fingers at PWD and the fire force department. He said two years ago they had asked the PWD to conduct a structural stability study but it did not do it. He also said the fire force did not give them a copy of the fire audit report which was submitted to the supermarket owner.
 
 Almeida said most of the shops sold food items which needed electrical equipment like microwave and coffee machine.
 
 “Recently, we had taken electricity bills from all the shops to see the load factor. This was because we were in the process of totally replacing the wiring. After 1982, nothing was done to rewire the area. Only additional wiring was done. We now have to totally remove it and give separate electricity phases for the building.” KTCL managing director Derek Pereira Neto said.
