THRISSUR: Police on Monday arrested P  , chairman and managing trustee of   and Charitable Trust, on charges of assaulting a student of the Nehru Law Academy, Ottappalam. 

 Rural SP N Vijayakumar said four others associated with the college - legal adviser Suchithra, administrative manager Sukumaran, physical education teacher Govindankutty and administrative executive Valsalakumar -- had also been arrested in the case. He said two others allegedly involved in the assault - Pambady Nehru College of Engineering and Research Centre PRO   and employee Srinivasan - were absconding.
 
 The arrest came on complaint filed by Shaheer Shoukhathali - a former student of the law academy - that he was assaulted by the accused on January 3 for sending a complaint against the college management over a fund collection drive to the chief minister. Shoukhathali is now studying in a law college at Kolappulli near Shoranur. 
 
 The SP said that the complainant alleged that he was taken from the law academy to the Pambady college on the pretext of a discussion with Krishnadas, tortured and forced to sign documents confessing that he ragged five students. Krishnadas and some other accused in the case are also arraigned as accused in the Jishnu suicide case.
