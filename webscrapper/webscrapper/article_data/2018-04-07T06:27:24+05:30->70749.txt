PANAJI: The Goa police created a green corridor to transport organs from   to   airport in 24 minutes on Friday afternoon. The organs were flown to a Mumbai-based hospital for transplant.

 
  
  
 
 The chartered aircraft that came for the harvested organs was given priority parking by the   at Dabolim. “This was to reduce the time taken by the ambulance,” the official said. While liver transplant was carried out on Friday, Salkar said the kidney transplant will be carried out on Saturday after recipients are decided by the transplant organization. The kidney harvested has a preservation time of up to 72 hours.
 
 A green corridor refers to a route that is demarcated and cleared out for an ambulance carrying harvested organs. The objective is to ensure that the in-transit organ arrives at its destination in the shortest time possible.
 
 The requirement for something like this arises from the fact that organs generally have a short preservation time which means that there are only a few hours within which the process, right from harvesting and transportation to the final transplantation surgery, must be completed.
