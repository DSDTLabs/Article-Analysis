THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Terming the "insult" meted out to deceased parliamentarian and IUML leader   by the   government as "unpardonable", the KPCC president V M Sudheeran has said that only a probe by a parliamentary committee can give clarity to the "mysterious incidents" at the   in New Delhi where Ahamed was admitted after he collapsed during the joint session of the parliament last week. 

 "Both the Prime Minister and   Speaker are guilty of creating a wrong precedence and thus insulting a great parliamentarian who was the secular face of the country. It's a black chapter in the history of   and the Modi government will have to pay a huge price for this," he said while inaugurating a day-long protest organized by the   in front of the Raj Bhavan here on Tuesday.
 
 Alleging that Ahmed was denied proper medical treatment, Sudheeran said, efforts were to present the Union budget, violating the usual norms followed after the death of any member. "Nothing would have happened if the budget presentation was postponed by a day. The Speaker, who is bound to protect the rights of MPs and uphold the decorum of Parliament, also acted like a crony of Modi," he said.
 
 Sudheeran also said that the insult to Ahmed and violation of medical ethics by RML hospital at the behest of the government will pave way for the end of Modi's "fascist rule" in the country. MYL state president Munavvar Ali Shihab Thangal presided over the meeting, while leaders, former minsters and MLAs from various political parties also attended.
