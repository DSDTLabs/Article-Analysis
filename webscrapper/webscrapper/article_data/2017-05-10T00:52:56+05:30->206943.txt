Madurai: Iron scrap from old vehicles, which have been created into beautiful sculptures by experts, will be put on display at the first-ever automobile sculpture park that is to be established in Madurai soon.

 Madurai Corporation commissioner Sandeep Nanduri, who inspected the making of these sculptures at the truck shed in Sellur, said that about 16 tonnes of scrap, predominantly old spare parts belonging to various vehicles used in the city, including garbage vehicles and water supply were used to create the sculptures with the help of experts. Such sculptures are already popular in places like Vijayawada, Guntur and Tirupathi in Andhra Pradesh, where parks have been established using them.
 
 A team of experts sculptors led by Srinivasa Rao from Andhra Pradesh have been working on these sculptures for the past four days who are also training the staff here on the making them. Fifteen welders from Madurai are also helping them in the task.
 
 Many of the sculptures have been made adhering to the tradition of Madurai. Some of them include a jallikattu bull, deer, a fish like the symbol of the Pandiya dynasty, deer, giraffe, peacock and owl. There is also a full   of the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi.
 
 This is the first time that a civic body in Tamil Nadu is taking such initiative to deal with its own scrap in a constructive way. Almost 50% of the scrap generated here have been used in these sculptures which have been made in three-dimensional format with intricate details. They will be painted once the making of the figures is completed.
 
 The corporation would soon identify a park to install these sculptures which will be an attraction to the city. It would be ensured that the park that would house these sculptures would have a good number of visitors including children and elders on a daily basis, Nanduri said.
