CHANDIGARH: Providing better services to residents of Chandigarh and dealing with the financial crunch will be key issues for new municipal   Kamal Kishor Yadav.  , who joined as a municipal commissioner on Wednesday, held a brief meeting with senior officers of the MC to get first-hand information of the issues of the civic body.

 Yadav said, “Providing better civic services to public is most crucial. Efforts will be made in this regard, so that we can facilitate residents with best services. Moreover, financial crunch is the crucial issue. I personally feel that if we will provide better and world-class services to the public, people won’t hesitate to pay, but the idea is to provide best services.”
 
 “Before looking for finances, we will have to seriously work to generate our own financial resources. The MC is not a department like others; we will have to be financially self-strong. The motive should not to overburden the public, but to provide them services,” Yadav said.
 
 Financial crunch is the most crucial challenge for the new officer as the civic body has already stopped agenda or works of over Rs 250 crore.
 
 Since the monthly house meeting is scheduled on Thursday, the new commissioner will face his first test.
