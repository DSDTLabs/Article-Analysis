SINGUR (Hooghy): Two youths from Hooghly drowned in a fish pond while taking a selfie on Wednesday afternoon. The duo Arghya Roy (21) from Konnagar and Jayanta Majhi (22) from Baidybati â€” did not know how to swim. 

 The duo were visiting Jayanta's relative Narayan in Singur to do a wedding's videography. To relieve themselves from Wednesday's scorcher, the youths along with a friend  , went fishing at a nearby pond.
 
 While Arghya and Jayanta were taking selfies in waist-deep water, Peter was taking their picture from the bank of the pond. Suddenly, the duo slipped from the bank and went underwater. Peter ran back home and informed their relatives but it was too late to save them. The locals failed to find their bodies. Later, divers from Kolkata recovered both the bodies from the pond on Wednesday afternoon.
 
 "As the pond bed is filled up with sand, it is likely that deep ditches form inside the waterbody, which can't be traced from the surface. They might have fallen into one of them," said Jayanta's relative. 
 
 "This is very unfortunate but they should have been more careful as they didn't know how to swim. They died due to the pond's undercurrent. No complaint has been filed so we are considering this as a case of unnatural death," said OC   of Singur police station.
