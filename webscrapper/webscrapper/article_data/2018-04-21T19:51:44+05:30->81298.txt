NEW DELHI: Former Union finance minister   said today he's quitting the BJP because the NDA, which it leads, is undermining democratic institutions.

 
  "Today I am taking 'sanyas' from any kind of party politics, today I am ending all ties with the BJP," Sinha said at an event in Patna.
 
  
  
 Sinha vowed to work for the protection of democracy in India as he blamed the NDA government for 
  during the Budget session.
 
  Sinha, who had joined the BJP in the mid-90s, said "Aaj se mera BJP ke saath rishta samapt ho gaya. Main apna sambandh viched kar raha hun BJP se. Main BJP se khud ko alag kar raha hun (From today my relation with BJP is over. I'm severing my ties with the party...)."
 
  
  
 He said that from now he will try to unite all non-BJP parties, "I will not join any political party and will have nothing to do with party-politics."
 
 "I am not an aspirant for any top post and I am making it clear here that I am not at all interested to seek any post," he added.
 
 Sinha, who was finance minister and external affairs minister in the Vajpayee government, had formed 'Rashtra Manch' on January 30, saying that it will be an apolitical forum and highlight "anti-people" policies of the Centre. 
 
 Leaders from the Congress and other opposition parties attended the first meeting of the manch today.
