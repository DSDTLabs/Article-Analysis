MARGAO:   (GFP) has demanded that the Election Commission hold an inquiry into the “mass enrollment” of over 600 army personnel, who turned up to cast their vote on February 4, at an election booth in  . 

 Addressing reporters on Friday, GFP spokesperson Prashant Naik said that names of over 600 army personnel figured in the electoral rolls published on January 18, which coincided with the last day of filing nominations for the state assembly elections. 
 
 “It is enough proof to conclude that registration of voters and revision of electoral rolls has not been done under the authority, control, supervision and superintendence of the EC. It is blatantly evident that   have worked under extraneous influences for registration of service voters as ordinary voters,” Naik said.
