AHMEDABAD: Banking on Gujaratis’ liking for holiday travel, Mohammed Asif Dhobi, a notorious Delhi burglar, swooped on locked bungalows and flats in the city. Dhobi stole valuables, cash and gold jewellery worth lakhs from locked houses for two years straight but was finally nabbed by city crime branch officials, from Delhi, on Friday night.

 Crime branch officials said Dhobi was accompanied by two accomplices, Mohammed Azam and Mohammed Arsi. “They are still on the run. We are in touch with our Delhi counterparts they also belong to Delhi,” a senior crime branch official said.
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (crime branch) Rajdeepsinh Zala said Mohammed Azam had suggested they target Gujarat as people here tend to prefer destinations holidays during the Diwali vacation.
 
 “Dhobi first came to Gujarat in the 2015 Diwali vacation and returned in 2016. He and his gang would drive to the state in cars. They would stay in expensive hotels and recce potential targets during the day. They would break into closed houses and steal valuables, cash and jewellery,” added Zala.
 
 Crime branch sources said the trio committed burglaries in Maninagar, Sola, Vastrapur, Kagdapith, Ellisbridge and Satellite areas of the city. “The gang also had a hand in 20 vehicle thefts in the Jagatpuri, Sabjimandi and Shakarpur areas of Delhi,” added crime branch officials.
 
 During the interrogation of the accused it came to light that Dhobi comes from a humble background was drawn into committing burglaries by his friends Mohammed Azam and Mohammed Arsi.
 
 “Delhi police were hunting for the gang for quite some time. Dhobi had twice earlier given them the slip by jumping out of the back window of his house when they came to arrest him. We suspect Dhobi is involved in more thefts in the city than he has confessed to,” said a crime branch official.
