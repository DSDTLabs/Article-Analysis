Panaji: The current phase of hearing on the water sharing of River Mhadei before the Mhadei Water Dispute Tribunal further weakened Karnataka’s case after their second witness, A K Bajaj, affirmed that they had over-estimated the water yield of the river.  Speaking after the day’s hearing, advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande said that Karnataka’s witness was shown over estimation by Karnataka to which he admitted. “The witness was shown the gross overestimation done by Karnataka for the Mahaprabha reservoir as well as the River Kali Dam to which the witness candidly admitted that there had been overestimation of yield and he was not in a position to state as to why this overestimation was done. The witness was specifically put a question that it is the habitual practice of Karnataka to overestimate yield for the basin while conceiving projects,” Lawande said.  During cross-examination by Goa’s legal team, it was also revealed that Bajaj did not possess sufficient knowledge in the field of hydrology.  “The witness showed complete lack of knowledge as far as the subject of hydrology is concerned. As to why he chose to rely on the Central Water Commission (CWC) report of 2003, the witness answered that since he had been the chairman of CWC and worked in CWC, he had relied on CWC reports,” Lawande said. “The witness was asked questions with respect to the various discrepancies in the CWC report, including the increase in rainfall values by 1mm every year, to which the witness did not have any answer,” officials said.  The official added that the tribunal also interjected and told the witness that he had earlier stated that he has the necessary expertise in the field of hydrology and he cannot give evasive answers.
