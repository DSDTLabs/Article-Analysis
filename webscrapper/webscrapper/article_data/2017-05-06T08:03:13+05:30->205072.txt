THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition staged a walkout from the assembly on Friday over chief minister  's "trivialization" of the arms seizure at  's College in Kochi by discarding them as "tools used for construction". The opposition's demand for an adjournment motion over the issue was also rejected by Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan. 

 The chief minister said the weapons seized on Wednesday were only iron rods and wooden sticks. "The students were on vacation and investigation is on to find out who placed them in the room," he said after reading out the list of 'tools' mentioned in the FIR.
 
 Though the Speaker tried to dissuade the opposition from presenting the motion saying that it was a local issue and not worth an adjournment motion, the latter pressed for it saying it was a larger issue that's destroying the sanctity of college campuses in the state.
 
 Congress leader P T  , presenting the motion, said Maharaja's College and many other reputed colleges were turning into havens for antisocial elements. "These campuses are strongholds of the SFI, and the chief minister is justifying their actions, including attacks on women teachers and principals including N L Beena and Dr Vijayalakshmi," he said, alleging police inaction.
 
 In his reply, the chief minister, said the allegations were part of a "false campaign at a time when the government was trying to transform these colleges into centres of excellence".
 
 Opposition leader   said in his walkout speech: "This is just a tip of the iceberg. Other student organisations are not allowed to function on campuses ruled by the SFI and ABVP."
 
 KC(M) leader   also joined the walkout accusing the government of laxity in taking strong measures "to prevent colleges from turning into armouries".
