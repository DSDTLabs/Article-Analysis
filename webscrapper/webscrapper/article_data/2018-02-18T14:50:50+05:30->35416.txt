Surat: A watchman was arrested and produced in a local court on Saturday for sodomizing three minor boys in   area of the city. The court remanded him in police custody till February 22. Two separate complaints against the watchman by two boys for threatening and blackmailing them could be registered. 

 A case under IPC Section 377 and 506(2) and the   ( ) Act Sections 4 and 6 was registered against Brijesh  , a native of Panna in Madhya Pradesh, at Adajan police station. 
 
 Tiwari, who was employed as a watchman in a residential complex, charged three boys — aged between 12 and 14 years — with stealing his mobile phone. He threatened that he would complain to their parents if they didn’t come to his room. The boys went to the watchman’s room whenever he called them from October 21, 2017. There, he used to sodomize them. The boys of late had stopped going out of their home to play and also avoided the watchman. Their family members smelt something fishy seeing their behaviour and asked them what was troubling them. A complaint was registered against the watchman on February 15 after the boys told their parents about his misdeed.
 
 A police officer said, “The accused, who is a bachelor, has confessed to his crime. We will try to find out since how long he has been exploiting children during his remand.”
