Nagpur: As the BJP-Shiv Sena state government plans to cover loans from 2009 in its   scheme, data compiled recently shows that 44.48 lakh   in Maharashtra have pending dues towards banks.

 The data on overdue loans has been secured by government from the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC). According to government’s estimates, there are 1.36 crore farmers in Maharashtra. “Out of this figure, 89 lakh farmers have secured bank loans,” said a senior official in the department of cooperatives which monitors agriculture lending activities. 
 
 It effectively means half the number of farmers who have secured loans from banks are defaulters as on June 30, 2016. The amount comes to more than Rs37,000 crore. Amounts up to Rs1.5 lakh are set to be waived by the state government.
 
 The waiver scheme now covers loans due from 2009 till June 30, 2016. Earlier, it was to cover loans from April 2012 to June 30, 2015. 
 
 Director of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)   says even if the loans within Rs1.5 lakh are covered, as much as 81% defaulters will be in the clear. “There is no need to allow waiver to loans beyond Rs1.5 lakh as it will only help the better-off farmers,” he said. 
 
 With 44.48 lakh defaulters, it shows that half of the farmers availing loans from banks have not repaid their dues till last year. The figures take into account loans irrespective of the amount, covering even the term loan which are secured to buy farm assets. 
 
 The waiver will cover both, crop loans (which is a short-term debt to meet sowing expenses) and term loans (which has a cap of Rs1.5 lakh).
 
 The number of farmers who have less than Rs1.5 lakh loan stands at 36 lakh and they will benefit fully. Their loan stands at Rs18,000 crore, which is 80% of the total defaulters.
 
 Yavatmal, which has been the epicentre of farmers’ suicides in recent years, has the highest number of defaulting farmers at 2.69 lakh accounts with unpaid dues to the tune of Rs1,800 crore. 
 
 At the same time, Mumbai city has more number of farm loans defaulters and loans as compared to Mumbai Suburban. There are 1,388 farm loan defaulters owing Rs309 crore in Mumbai city. In Mumbai suburban, it is 316 loan accounts with Rs33 crore of loans.
 
 Even though Vidarbha is known for its farm crisis, some of districts of the region account for the lowest defaulters. These are districts in paddy-growing areas where the number of defaulting farmers’ accounts are in four figures with the loans ranging within Rs400 crore.
 
 On the defaults, Tiwari said that the number has increased due to the “clamour for waiver”. “Various outfits began demanding waiver since March which encouraged many farmers to stop the repayment. This has led to piling up of dues,” he said.
