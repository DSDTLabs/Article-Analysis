VADODARA: Around 36 students eligible for admission under Right to Education (RTE) Act were denied admission by   in Makarpura on Wednesday. The school management told the parents that since it was a school run by minority trust, the   Act was not applicable to them.

 Parents said that they were informed from the DEO office to visit the school on Wednesday to complete the admission process. But when they reached there, they were denied admission. It was only last week that parents had approached Basil School and   in the city demanding that their wards be granted admission in the school based on admit cards issued to them under the RTE Act.
 
 The parents then went to the office of DEO to raise the issue. “We told the district education officials that the school has denied admission to our wards. The officials have asked us to come again on Thursday promising that our problem will be resolved,” said Sanjay Mistry, a parent.
 
 Minority schools are of the opinion that according to a 2014 ruling of Supreme Court, RTE Act will not be applicable to aided or unaided minority schools.
 
 Meanwhile, two other minority schools – St John’s School and   – have agreed to admit students under the RTE Act after the DEO had slapped notices to 15 minority schools. The DEO office has also asked all schools to release list of students admitted under RTE Act by Friday.
 
 A total of 400 students have been granted admissions in 20 minority schools under the act.
