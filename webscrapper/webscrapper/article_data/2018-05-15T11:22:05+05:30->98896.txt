PUNE: The inordinate delay in starting work on the proposed underpass even two years after its ground-breaking ceremony has left the residents of about 30 housing societies in Hadapsar, Sasanenagar, fuming. To make matters worse, the residents alleged the recent road-widening works at the railway crossing near Sasanenagar, too, was executed poorly.

 
  
 
 On Sunday, about 250 of the residents took out a morcha against the deplorable condition of road infrastructure that causes daily hardships and traffic jams. They blamed political tussle and negligence of civic officials. 
 
 Vaibhav Mane, of Foundation of Housing Societies-Hadapsar, said the protest was to remind the civic administration and politicians about the repeated demands made by local residents. Mane said, “The ground-breaking of the underpass took place two years ago, but nothing has happened since then. Now we got to know that this underpass is not likely to be built and will be replaced by two other underpasses. Why was the ground-breaking conducted when the officials and politicians knew that the project was not possible?”
 
 Yogesh Sasane, the local corporator, said the ground-breaking was held two years ago, but then neither the civic administration nor the BJP-led civic body took any steps to start the work. As a result, the funds lapsed, he said.
