NEW DELHI: Attacks by stone pelters, apart from terror strikes, are seen as a potential threat to the annual Amarnath pilgrimage beginning June 29, a senior home ministry official said on Tuesday. 

 Around 27,900 security personnel will be deployed along the ‘yatra’ route to ensure proper security of pilgrims, adviser in the home ministry Ashok Prasad said after a meeting here to discuss security for the 40-day-long event. The meeting was chaired by home secretary   and attended by senior officers of defence ministry, ministry of earth sciences, DoT; DGs of CRPF, BSF, ITBP and SSB; CEO of Amarnath Shrine Board, J&K chief secretary B B Vyas and DGP S P Vaid. 
 
 “There are equal threats from militants and stone-pelters. All threats are being taken care of,” Prasad said when asked whether stone pelting mobs could target the yatra. 
 
 Forces will take into consideration all issues before finalising the security plan, he said in response to a question on the possible impact of the destruction of Pakistan army posts by the  . The review on Tuesday also examined arrangements for telecom connectivity, healthcare, fire safety, electricity and water supply, weather forecasting and disaster management during the yatra. J&K government has sought around 27,000 central paramilitary personnel to help it secure the pilgrimage, up from Rs 20,000 deployed last year.
