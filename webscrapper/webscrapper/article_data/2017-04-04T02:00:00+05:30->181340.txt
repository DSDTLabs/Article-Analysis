PATNA: Two bike-borne criminals allegedly looted Rs3.5 lakh from two persons near   branch close to   railway station under Bihta police station area on Monday evening. 

 City SP (West)   said the incident looks suspicious as the victims — Sanjay Kumar (45) and Rajeev Ranjan (35) -- did not raise an alarm after the loot. “The duo, who claimed that the incident took place near the bank neither informed the bank officials nor sought help from the passersby,” the SP said, adding that one person was carrying Rs1.5 lakh while another was carrying Rs2 lakh. They had collected the money from villagers in Bihta locality against their electricity bills. 
 
 Sanjay, who is a   employee, has lodged an FIR in this connection with the Bihta police station. He said there were bank drafts worth around Rs20 lakh in his bag which the miscreants also looted. 
 
 Police said Sanjay was travelling with Rajeev, an employee of a private firm working for the power distribution company, when the incident took place. Police also said their versions about the loot differed. “We are screening the   footage of the area to get more information about the alleged loot,” the SP said.
