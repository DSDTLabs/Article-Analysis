GAYA: The four-member medical board constituted to conduct   of an eight-year-old girl, whose body was recovered from outside the western boundary of Gaya DMâ€™s official residence on February 7, has confirmed that the minor girl was raped.

 Post  , the girl was strangled to death and her body dumped in a bush in the most protected area of the town. Besides official residence of the DM, the residences of MU VC and jail superintendent are located in the vicinity. The place of occurrence is also less than 500 metres away from the residence of the district judge and the Gaya Circuit House.
 
 Police officers are still reluctant to comment on the contents of the medical report. However, the case instituted in the Rampur police station includes section 376 (rape). Besides 376, the case against the accused has been registered under sections 302, 363, 364 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Zonal IG   has asked Gaya police to complete the investigation and submit chargesheet within seven days. Experts believe that if the prosecution displays the same zeal that was shown in the case of the Japanese tourist  , justice could be done within the next few weeks.
