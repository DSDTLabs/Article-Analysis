HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Friday sought an explanation from Telangana’s new chief secretary   as to why the state did not set up the State Debt Relief Commission so far.

 
 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and   reminded him that it was the   who assured the court in Aug 2017 that the commission will be set up by Nov 2017.
 
 The bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice J Uma Devi gave this direction while hearing a contempt case filed by BJP leader  , who charged the chief secretary with wilfully disobeying the order of the court in respect of constituting the   for Debt Relief. The petitioner’s counsel Balaji Vadera told the court that the state had brought in a law,   State Commission for Debt Relief (Small Farmers, Agricultural Labourers and Rural Artisans) Act 2016. Though this was aimed at helping the farmers in distress, it will be useful only when the required mechanism is kept in place by the state in tune with the provisions of the Act. As the provisions of this Act, the state should must constitute a debt relief commission, he said. When nothing of that sort was forthcoming, we approached the court seeking the constitution of the commission. The state then said it would set up the commission within three months. That time limit was over by November 2017, he said.
 
 Stating that the CS has to either comply with the order of the court, or he has to file an application seeking some more time to comply with the order, the bench said that the CS did not do any of them. Now file an affidavit explaining about the time frame within which you will set up the commission and also the reasons why we should not initiate proceedings against you under contempt of courts Act, the bench said and posted the case to 2 weeks.
