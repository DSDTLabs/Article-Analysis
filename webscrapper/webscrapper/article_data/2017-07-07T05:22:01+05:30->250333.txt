MUMBAI: “I haven’t been allowed to meet my child,’’ complained the woman who delivered a child with severe neurological malformations at KEM Hospital, Parel, almost three months after the   didn’t grant her permission for an  .

 The   resident said she has been stressed and suffering “severe headaches” ever since she delivered on July 1. “My entire family has been stressed. My mother-in-law who is waiting outside the NICU has developed fever. My husband has been forced to take long leave from his new job. My father has been commuting between Dahisar and the hospital. No one has been able to concentrate on earning a living,” she said. 
 
 She moved the Supreme Court in March when, in the 27th week of her pregnancy, she found out that the foetus had severe neurological problems. On Saturday, the child was born naturally with Arnold Chiari Type II syndrome, having a poorly formed brain and spinal cord.
 
 On Thursday, KEM Hospital dean Dr Avinash Supe said, “The child is not on ventilator. We carried out a CT scan and our neurosurgeons have said there is no need for a surgery.”
 
 The parents initially seemed reluctant to take the child home. However, on Thursday, the woman told TOI that she wants to be discharged from hospital so that she can spend time with her child. “But I am being kept in hospital without any explanation,’’ she said.
 
 Dr Supe said that mothers of neonates in NICU are usually kept in the hospital to reduce strain on the family concerned. “It won’t help if the child is kept here and the mother is at home,” said another doctor.
 
 The family has repeatedly underlined its financial inability to pay for the child’s operations and upkeep. The woman told TOI that there is no point planning surgeries and interventions as “it’s known what will finally happen”. Dr Supe said the prognosis cannot be made right away. “Child with such complications could live for a couple of weeks or for two months,” he added.
