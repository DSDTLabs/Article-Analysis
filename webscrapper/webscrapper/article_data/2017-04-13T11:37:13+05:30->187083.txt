PUNE: Bowing to protests by a group of parents and alumni of The Bishop's School over the discontinuation of   as chief executive officer, the school’s management decided to   with his term till December 31, 2017. 

 For two days, the parents had protested outside the Camp branch of the school against the management's decision to discontinue his services.
 
 On Tuesday, about 100 parents gathered outside the Camp branch insisting that the management continue with Freese as   and principal considering his vast experience and threatened to intensify the protest if the decision was not rolled back.
 
 The parents were heard by the governing council which took their inputs. On Wednesday, after they got no satisfactory explanation, the parents gathered from 9am at the school gate until Freese addressed them and informed them about the management's decision.
 
 Later in the evening, a statement issued by the headmaster of the school, stated, "The governing body of The Bishop's Education Society met at The Bishop's School, Camp, on April 12 to discuss school matters which included the issue of the present principal, Mr Frank Freese, whose term of office was expiring on May 31, 2017."
 
 The statement added, "The meeting of the governing body considered the request of Mr Frank Freese and re-appointed him up to December 31, 2017, after which Joel Edwin, The Bishop's School, Camp, will take charge in his place from January 1, 2018.”
