YAMUNANAGAR: A forest department official was arrested in   on Thursday for allegedly helping a gang of inter-state wood smugglers. The accused identified as Sarvjit Singh was posted as forest range officer in Yamunanagar district.

 “Some smugglers had set up a fictitious firm and used fake bills of wood to deceive the police. The accused range officer had authenticated the fake bills used by the smugglers as genuine,” said Yamunanagar SP Rajesh Kalia.
 
 Police had caught a truck laden with khair tree wood weighing 125 quintals from the   forest area last year. “A person named   claiming to be the owner of a firm dealing in timber produced bills before the court claiming to the a genuine buyer of the wood. Forest range officer Sarvjit was deputed to ascertain the authenticity of the bills. Instead of producing the facts, he stated the bill was genuine,” said the SP.
