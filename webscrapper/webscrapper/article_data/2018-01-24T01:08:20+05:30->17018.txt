Noida: At least five doctors at the Super-Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Noida have either resigned or are in the process of doing so following some media reports that the current members won’t be retained once the health facility is taken over by  .

 Though the UP government had last year written to the Union health ministry requesting that AIIMS take over the Noida hospital, the proposal hasn’t made much headway. Officials at the paediatric hospital claimed the doctors had put down their papers for personal reasons, but sources said the apparent uncertainty had prompted them to do so. While a cardiologist and a neurologist have already left, an anaesthetist, a cardiologist and a neonatologist are serving their notice period. If there are no more resignations, the Sector 30 hospital will have 31 doctors in February against the total 36 posted there. The doctors said the uncertainty over whether the AIIMS management would retain them led to their decision.
 
 “There is widespread uncertainty over the future of the staff here. Although there has been little progress in the proposal to take over the hospital, we are aware of reports claiming that the AIIMS management might not retain the current staff as and when it starts running the facility,” said a doctor who recently resigned.
 
 The doctor also complained about alleged mismanagement at the hospital and lack of recognition from the Medical Council of India, without which the health facility cannot start teaching resident scholars. Officials agreed there was an uncertainty but claimed that the spate of resignations were because of personal reasons.
 
 “We will try to explain to the faculty members that the AIIMS proposal is merely a news item. There is nothing concrete as of now,” said Dr A K Bhatt, the director of the peadiatric hosspital.
 
 He said the authorities would soon write to the chief secretary’s office seeking permission to start the replacement process.
