SECUNDERABAD: The   (MoD) has laid down procedures to be followed for the closure of roads in 62 cantonments across the country. In its orders issued on May 28 to the chief executive officers (CEOs) of all 62 cantonments, defence estates officers and LMAs of cantonments, the MoD said proposal for closure of a road should be forwarded to the MoD for legal vetting. 

 
 
 After legal vetting, MoD will issue a final order for closure of the road concerned. It will be communicated to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) the Command concerned or principal director. 
 
 "It is absolutely essential to follow the procedure prescribed in Section of 258 of the Cantonments Act 2006. No public road in the Cantonments shall be closed by the   without following due procedure," the MoD said.
 
 This is the first order issued by MoD as part of the Standard Operation Procedure to be followed during the closure of roads after the MoD ordered reopening of the closed roads last week.
 
 The order also clearly stated that after MoD gives its final nod, it will be published in at least three newspapers (one English and two local languages).
