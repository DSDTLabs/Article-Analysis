KOLKATA: It was only a week back that Kolkata Knight Riders and   faced off in a league match of   at the Eden Gardens. The two teams clash again here on Wednesday, this time in a virtual quarterfinal where the stakes are sky-high.

 
 
 
 Practice sessions of both teams had to be cancelled on Tuesday because of a sharp shower lashing the city. The two team managements will keep an eye on the sky as there is possibility of rain playing spoilsport in Wednesday’s Eliminator too.
 
 
 
 The form book points to  , who have not only beaten the Royals twice this season but are also on a three-match winning run that helped them finish third on the points table. Royals made the grade by winning four of their last five matches.
 
  
  
 KKR also have more experience when it comes to handling the pressure of playing in the knockout phase. Apart from making the playoffs for the sixth time, KKR are two-time champions, having won the tournament in 2012 and 2014. Royals, on the other hand, have won the IPL once — the inaugural edition in 2008 — and have made the knockout phase for the third time.
 
 Royals, however, deserve much credit for having overcome a sluggish start to make the playoffs on their return to IPL after serving a two-season ban. They will be definitely missing their England duo of Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes, who have been summoned for national duty.
 
 Stokes may have commanded the highest price at IPL auction, but has hardly lived up to the billing. Buttler, on the other hand, has been a revelation. The Englishman almost single-handedly turned around RR’s fortunes this season with his aggressive bating at the top of the order.
 
 Skipper Ajinkya Rahane will no doubt be happy that young Rahul Tripathi, who had a great season last year with Rising Pune Supergiant, is back among runs with a 58-ball unbeaten 80 in their last match against Royal Challengers Bangalore.
