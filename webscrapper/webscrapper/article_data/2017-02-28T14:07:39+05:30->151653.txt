CHENNAI:   filed with   reveal more about officials'   and their affinity towards whole numbers than the reality.

 An   filed by advocacy group ChangeIndia seeking details of the money spent by the district child protection units (DCPU) on awareness programmes revealed that 26 of the state's 32 districts had spent precisely Rs2 lakh each, till the last zero, in 2014. In 2015, the figure was zero for all the districts. In 2016, the Rs 2 lakh returned.
 
 When TOI asked a senior official in the department of social welfare and nutrition meal programme about the accuracy of the number, he said the department had spent exactly the budget allocated to the units by the Centre, till the last rupee. It was a retired official who finally solved the puzzle.
 
 "DCPUs receive 80% of funds from the Centre. Since the state didn't utilise the funds in 2014, the government withdrew the funds the following year," the official said. "If they haven't utilised the funds, it means they haven't organised any awareness camp," he said.
 
 To an RTI application filed by activist V Vikash Christyraj with the Tamil Nadu state legal services authority , which sought to know how many victims of child sexual abuse were given compensation by the state, the reply said of the 261 pending applications, seven were given compensation in 2015-2016. The following year, 19 were given compensation and 48 applications were pending. The balance from the previous year failed to reflect in the rise in the number of victims compensated in 2016-2017.
 
 It isn't just discrepancy in the data that is posing a hurdle in reflection and implementation of policies related to children. "Awareness of laws related to children are poor among district-level officers despite various training programmes," said K Shanmugavelayuthan, convener of TN FORCES (a forum for cr√®che and childcare services). "How then can you expect them to be more proactive when they don't know how to react?"
