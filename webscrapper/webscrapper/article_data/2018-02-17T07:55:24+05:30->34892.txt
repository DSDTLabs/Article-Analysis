BENGALURU: The Karnataka government may have been in a celebratory mood after the   on Friday allocated 4.75tmcft of   river water for Bengaluru, but the quantity is unlikely to slake the city’s thirst.

 One tmcft of water measures up to 2800 crore litres and meets the drinking needs of 6 lakh people a year.
 
 
 Bengaluru’s present water requirement, considering its billion-plus population, is estimated at 31tmcft. But Friday’s verdict leaves the city, at the most, with 13.75tmcft.
 
 “I would say the Supreme Court’s verdict is positive for Karnataka but falls short of quenching Bengaluru’s thirst,” said Captain  , a water expert.
 
 The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT), in its final award in 2007, had allocated 270tmcft of water for Karnataka, including 8.75tmcft for Bengaluru.
 
 While it is the state government’s prerogative to allocate water out of its quota, it allocated 10tmcft to the city in 2008, and in 2014, approved a proposal to draw an additional 10tmcft for Bengaluru.
 
 “At present, we are using 18.75tmcft, including the 8.75tmcft allocated by the tribunal, and 10tmcft sanctioned by the state government in 2008. The additional 10tmcft approved in 2014 will be utilized for the   Stage-5, which is likely to be commissioned by 2023,” said Kemparamaiah, engineer-in-chief of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board ( ).
 
 He claimed that 18.75tmcft of water currently being utilized is enough to meet the present requirement of the city. But experts point out that BWSSB’s calculation is based on the 2011 census, when the population was 95lakh. The city’s current population is understood to have touched the 1.25crore mark, they added.
 
 “When you calculate the drinking water requirement of a city, you need to consider the latest population figures and geographical area. BWSSB is relying on numbers that are seven years old, which are of no help,” said Y D Manmohan, vice-president of  , and a water expert who had drawn up a road map to clean up Bellandur Lake last year for the Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Corporation Limited (KSIIDC).
 
 “The Supreme Court’s award of 4.75tmcft will help only to some extent. The city’s population is expected to touch 2.5crore by 2032, and without a comprehensive plan and effective implementation, the city will be more thirsty than now,” said  , a retired IAS officer who presented a paper to the state government on Bengaluru’s drinking water issue.
 
 Admitting that the calculation of the city’s water requirement is based on population figures from the 2011 census, Kemparamaiah said the BWSSB at is supplying 1.5tmcft water per month and 100 litres per person, per day.
 
 However, according to the Bureau of Indian Standards, BIS 1172, per head demand for water per day in any community with a population of over 1lakh, is 135-150litres.
 
 “We are short of 3.5tmcft, considering the latest population figures,” Kemparamaiah conceded. He said Bengaluru is also betting on the Yettinahole project that is expected to bring 2.5tmcft water to the city.
