 There were buyers from  , Sidhauli, Sitapur and Unnao who flocked the Kaiserbagh market. “The   was planned in advance but things went awry after the meat sellers’ strike. Though mutton and chicken is available in some districts, we are not getting it the quantity required, hence we decided to put fish on the menu,” said Mohammad Faheem from Barabanki.
 
 Anas Siddiqui from Sitapur said, “Rajab procession will start from March 30 and we have organised a feast on each day. I got 25kg rohu, pomfret and mangur in advance.”
