THANE: Greater community participation, stricter penalties and fines, in addition to the provision of   and disposal facilities will help the lake-city regain its title of green city, claim citizen activists.

 While the city ranking fell from 17 last year to 116 this time in the Swacch Survekshan survey, activists’ believe that the rankings could have improved if there was an inclusive and interactive approach to the cleanliness movement by citizens as well as corporation.
 
 Dr. Mahesh Bedekar, who has been leading the Swachh Bharat movement near his home and hospital, said, “Creating a   and pollution-free environment is not the role of only the corporation, but also the residents. The officials cannot keep collecting waste from each and every home every few hours. So, we need to contribute towards this movement. We need to take this low ranking as a challenge and come together as a society, community or even family and clean the mess in our areas, just like we keep our homes clean. If every citizen thinks like this, it will show results and bring us among the top clean cities in the country,” he added.
 
 In addition to encouraging this model of citizen engagement in local initiatives, activists believe that strict laws will also ensure that citizens don’t break the rules.
 
 “Littering, defecating in the open, dumping waste outside one’s home or in the nullah is a common sight. While one reason is the poor waste collection mechanism by the corporation, another is the fact that the laws are not implemented strictly. If citizens were fined heavily for littering or throwing waste, they will think twice before doing so in the future,” said Dr. Lata Ghanshamnani, a citizen activist dealing with solid waste management related issues for the past five years.
