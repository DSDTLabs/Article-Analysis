JALANDHAR: It is not for the first time that Sikh separatist   has hit the headlines for the wrong reasons. While questions are doing round about his visa to travel to India this time, a major controversy had erupted in 2006 over his visa request in Canada which put two Liberal MPs in piquant situation.

 Vancouver (North) Liberal MP Don Bell called up Indian consul general to get   an Indian visa. However, when the controversy erupted Bell publicly confirmed that he had called up the Indian consul general in Canada but had done so after being requested by Vancouver (South) MP Ujjal Dosanjh. 
 
 Bell was quoted in Canadian media saying that Dosanjh had not mentioned about Atwal’s conviction in the case of attempt on life of a minister from India and he was not aware of this fact when he called up Indian consul general.
 
 Interestingly, Atwal was accused of assaulting Dosanjh in 1985 but he was acquitted in the case. Dosanjh later became a federal minister and the   premier. The attack was said to be related to due to Dosanjh’s views on the events in Punjab in 1980s.
 
 Bell was even quoted by the Canadian media saying he knew that Atwal had a history with Dosanjh but was not at all aware of his conviction in the case of attempt on the life of a visiting minister from India.
 
 When contacted over phone, Dosanjh told TOI from Canada that Atwal did come to his office for help and his staff communicated to Bell’s staff and made the latter aware of Atwal’s past. “I don’t know if Bell was informed by his staff about it or not. I don’t want to quibble with my old colleague on it. I did not intervene in the matter as it would not have been appropriate as I could be having a bias about him,” he said.
