  The cabinet accepted the findings of a three-member panel formed in August 2017 to look into various issues related to the shrine. The panel was asked to submit its report after consulting all the parties concerned and devotees. The right wing had opposed the formation of the panel as they wanted the shrine to be declared as a Hindu place of worship. 
 
  Law minister T B Jayachandra told reporters after the cabinet meeting that regarding worship at the shrine, status quo of 1947 will be maintained - both Hindus and Muslims will be allowed to worship - and the Shah Qadri of the shrine will come under the muzrai department and not under the wakfs. 
 
  The Supreme court in its order on September 3, 2015 had directed the state government to decide the title claims over the disputed shrine. When the government delayed taking action for more than a year, Shah Qadri of the dargah moved the apex court, which asked the government to settle the issue within six weeks. 
 
 The government constituted a sub-committee, headed by law minister T B Jayachandra, which felt it appropriate for an expert panel to look into the issue. A committee was then constituted - headed by retired HC judge T N Nagamohan Das, and noted historian S Shettar and writer and Kannada University professor Rahmath Tarikere as the members.
