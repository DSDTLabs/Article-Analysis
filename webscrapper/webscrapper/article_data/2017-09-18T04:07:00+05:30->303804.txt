Ahmedabad: The international delegates who participated in 2nd International Buddhist Conference at Mahatma Mandir said that the event will create awareness about the Buddhist heritage of Gujarat and will also bring in Buddhist from different parts of the world for tourism. 

 The seven-day conference was inaugurated on Sunday afternoon in Gandhinagar, where over 300 delegates from 22 countries are participating.
 
 
 “The relevance of Buddhist heritage sites of Gujarat speaks of the profound Buddhist and Ashokan legacy. If accurately exhibited, it can attract Buddhist community from south, south-east and far east Asia,” said Bhante Prashil Gautam, president of Sangha Kaya Foundation, the primary organizers of the event.
 
 Dr Pornchai Pinyapong, president of World Alliance of Buddhists (WAB), said that the relevance of Buddhism can be felt most when societies are plagued with issues such as terrorism and everyone is looking for inner peace. “India is the land of Lord Buddha and every year over 5 million Buddhists visit the holy sites in India. I am sure that the association with local organizations through platforms like the conference will add a new chapter of international alliance,” said Pinyapong, a Thai national.
 
 Dr Yuan Xin, associate professor at Dharma Buddhist Univesity, Malaysia, said that there is dire need for research in Buddhist studies today. “I did not know about Gujarat’s ancient Buddhist culture and will surely love to visit the sites in the state,” she said.
 
 Ramdas Athawale, union minister of Social Justice, Prince Thanora Norodom of Cambodia, Bhante Sadanand Mahathero, president of All India Bhikhshu Sangh and Acharya Lokesh Muni among other participated in the inaugural ceremony.
