HYDERABAD: A mudslide at an under-construction commercial complex in Kondapur on Monday morning killed two workers. 

 Authorities probing the incident, found poor safety standards at the site and filed cases against the site engineer and contractor. 
 
 A mound of loose soil and mud, that was dug up to create space for three cellars, fell in a heap on workers early in the morning. They remained buried under the mud for nearly two hours, before being pulled out. The tragedy struck barely half an hour after they began removing mud from pillars being constructed at the site at around 8.30 am and were working nearly 40 feet below the ground level. 
 
 All six workers hail from Kammareddy and Sangareddy districts. Police said Bharatamma (25) and Kishtamma (45) died in the tragedy, while Bharatamma's husband Balraj and Kishtamma's husband Papaiah suffered injuries. 
 
 Two more workers, Hamumanthu and Shantamma, who were trapped in the debris, escape unhurt. Although rescue operation began immediately, co-workers and relatives of the victims refused to let the bodies be shifted for a postmortem examination and staged protests demanding that authorities visit the spot and announce compensation.
