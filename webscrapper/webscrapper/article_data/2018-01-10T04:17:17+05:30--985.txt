NEW DELHI: Hanging by the neck to execute a death sentence may continue as the Centre told the   on Tuesday that it was the only “viable” option and the apex court said it could not direct the government to adopt any particular method.

 Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y  , additional solicitor general Pinky Anand said the present method of hanging by the neck was the only viable option but sought four weeks’ time to file affidavit after examining methods followed in other countries to execute capital punishment.
 
 The court granted the time to the Centre to make its stand clear and said it was for the government to take a call and it (the court) could not say on what method to be adopted to execute death sentence. The apex court had on October 6 agreed to examine whether execution of death sentence by hanging could be done away with in the country and replaced by other procedures like injecting lethal injection or shooting. It had said that a convict facing death must die in peace and not in pain. It had said the government and   could explore other less painful options to execute death sentence and sought response from the Centre on a plea seeking its response for quashing of Section 354(5) of Criminal Procedure Code, which prescribes execution of death sentence and says a condemned prisoner shall be hanged by the neck till he is dead.
 
 The court had passed the order on a PIL filed by advocate Rishi Malhotra alleging that the present system of execution of the death sentence is not only barbaric, inhuman and cruel but also against the Resolutions adopted by the United Nations Economic Social Council which says capital punishment must be carried out so as to inflict minimum possible suffering to condemned prisoners. Referring to various law commission reports, the petitioner contended that the Commissions had also favoured for adopting other procedures for death sentence.
