SHIMLA: At a time when the   is trying to corner chief minister Jai Ram Thakur-led government in Himachal Pradesh on the deteriorating law and order situation, the BJP has retaliated by saying that the Congress leadership in the state is busy in a battle of supremacy due to which they are coming out with conflicting statements.

 Addressing mediapersons in Shimla on Saturday, BJPâ€™s chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma said that state Congress president Sukhvinder Singh, former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and Congress legislature party leader Mukesh Agnihotri are toeing different lines. He said that now former Union minister Anand Sharma too has jumped into the battle of supremacy.
 
 As Anand Sharma on Friday had sought an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Randhir Sharma said that Congress leader should tell people of his achievement as central minister during the UPA regime. He said that as minister, Anand Sharma had snatched the special industrial package given to Himachal Pradesh by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government. He further said that Sharma was limited only to making false statements.
 
 He said that a race had started among Congress leadership in the state to make false statements against the BJP government, besides the leadership battle in the state.
