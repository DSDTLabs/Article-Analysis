HYDERABAD: Five months after a daily wage worker was found murdered on the railway tracks at  , Kachiguda police solved the case by arresting four persons, including his wife, on Tuesday. 

 On July 28, 2017, D  , a labourer from Kachiguda, lodged a complaint with police stating that her husband D   was missing. Subsequently, Kachiguda police came to know that Yellaiah was found dead on the railway tracks near Nimboliadda rail bridge. The murder case, registered by the Kachiguda railway police, was transferred to their law and order counterparts. 
 
 During investigation, police came to know that Jamuna, a native of Karnataka, had married one Kishan of Maharastra 16 years ago and they came to Hyderabad 13 years ago in search of livelihood. A decade ago, Jamuna deserted Kishan and started living with Yellaiah. After Jamuna started living with him, Yellaiah quit work and started harassing his wife for money to buy alcohol. "Unable to put up with the harassment, Jamuna changed her house several times without informing Yellaiah, but he used to trace her whereabouts and harass her again for money," DCP, East Zone, C   said.
 
 Despite Jamuna's family requesting him to mend his ways, Yellaiah continued to harass her. He also started beating Jamuna's two children and behave in a psychotic manner by cutting his hands with blades, eating tube light powder and walking semi nude in front of the house.
 
 On July 28, Yellaiah thrashed Jamuna and her kids black and blue for not giving him money to purchase liquor. After the incident, Jamuna requested her family members Dattha Kishan Telang, Babu Rao Telang and   to eliminate him. 
 
 The trio hatched a plan to kill Yellaiah and took him to railway tracks near Nimboliadda bridge by promising to give him alcohol. The trio then killed him by throwing boulders on his head. After a detailed probe, police arrested the four. They were remanded to judicial custody.
