CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday issued notice to the Haryana government on a plea seeking directions to ensure   was maintained during the ongoing   for reservation so that people might not face any blockade of roads.

 The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a public interest litigation filed by a local lawyer alleging that the persons sitting on dharnas in various parts of Haryana were likely to block the national highways and state highways for pressing their demands. He submitted that due to such protests, great inconvenience was likely to be caused to a public at large, as seen during the February 2016 protests.
 
 Petitioner has sought directions to ensure that all the national highways/state highways/railway tracks falling in the state remained open so that the situation of last year's agitation may not occur again.
 
 He alleged that due to previous agitation, various essential services were adversely affected like ambulance carrying the patients, supply of essential commodities like vegetable and milk. The schoolchildren had also suffered due to the blockage of such national highways and state highways because they could not reach their schools and back to their homes and their studies were also adversely affected, petitioner submitted.
 
 He pleaded for directions to Haryana chief secretary to take preventive measures to maintain public order throughout Haryana and to take all necessary actions to ensure that free flow of public was not stopped, roads were not jammed, railway tracks were not blocked and government and other properties were not damaged.
 
 Hearing the plea, HC has asked the state government to file its reply on petitionerâ€™s contentions by March 15.
