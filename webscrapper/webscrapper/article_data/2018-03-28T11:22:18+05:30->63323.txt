PONDA: Priol MLA and art and culture minister   has said that the   at Deulwada, Marcel, in Ponda taluka will get an additional classroom after a demand for the same over the last 13 years. “We have been demanding for the classroom since 2005 and it will be possible now because I have been elevated as a minister,”   said.

 Gaude laid a foundation stone for the extension of the school building on Tuesday. He said the construction work will cost around Rs 15 lakh including the cost of interiors and furnishing and it will be completed before the beginning of the new academic year.
 
 The two-classroom school has a strength of 105 students and two divisions. Classes I and II are conducted in one classroom while Classes III and IV are conducted in the second classroom. The minister said the number of students in the school has increased since 2005. “Since I have become a minister, I have taken up the work,” Gaude said, adding that it was the duty of the village panchayat to look after the needs of schools in its jurisdiction, but it had failed to do so.
 
 Deputy sarpanch of Tivrem-Orgao panchayat,  , Betki-Khandola sarpanch  , ward members Paik Gaude, Unnati Naik, Manmita Naik, Sanket Amonkar, parents teachers’ association president Dhananjay Chari, director of education Gajanan Bhat and school headmaster Saju Wadkar were among those attended the programme.
