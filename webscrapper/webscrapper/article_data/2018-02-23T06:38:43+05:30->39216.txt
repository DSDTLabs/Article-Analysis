 Mariraj told TOI that after the dispute both he and the college authorities called the police.

 A controversy had erupted following Mariraj’s suicide bid at the college hostel three months ago. Mariraj had lodged an FIR with Shahibaug police against some professors alleging discrimination on the basis of his caste.
