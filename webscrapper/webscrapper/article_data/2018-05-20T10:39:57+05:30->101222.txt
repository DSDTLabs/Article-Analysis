KANYAKUMARI: A cluster of   (Himantopus himantopus) breeding nests were spotted amidst salt pans in Swamithoppu. They were spotted by environmental educator and activist   of Nagercoil in a mudflat adjoining the Manakudi Estuarine and in the Manakudi Bird Reserve. He said that these birds with distinctively long red legs build their nests as a cluster dotted in a close proximity to one another.

 Davidson said that   belong to the shorebirds and waders category. Unlike many shorebirds, they don’t swim while feeding as they don’t have webbed feet, but feed by pecking aquatic insects, molluscs, crustaceans, spiders, worms, tadpoles, small fish, fish eggs and seeds while wading in the water.
 
 Black winged stilts are characterised by their extremely long red legs, white stomach and jet-black wings. The distinctive legs make up around 60% of their overall height, providing the bird a feeding advantage over other waders even in relatively deeper waters. Adults are 33 to 36 cm long.
 
 “They raise a loud hue and cry when anyone interferes or intrudes in their habitat while they are breeding. The birds then fly from the nests together, raise a loud alarm call and even try to attack the intruders,” he said. But these ground nesting birds face threats on air and on land from predators. On air they fall prey to owls, kites, falcons and crows while on land the eggs are preyed by wild cats and street dogs.
 
 They are globally widespread wading birds and their population is found in many countries. Global warming and climate change, conversion of wetlands into residential areas and industries, dwindling number of wetlands would have direct impact on the bird life in future, added Davidson.
 
 “Owing to umpteen threats to this ground nesting bird, species specific conservation is the need of the hour to save the species,” the conservationist said.
