IMPHAL: Unlike previous years, 2017 started with a whimper, not a bang, in conflict-hit Manipur.

 The United Naga Council (UNC)'s ongoing economic blockade on the two national highways of the state, and the commodity crisis this gave rise to, played spoilsport. Picnic spots in and around Imphal city like the picturesque  ,   ,Kangchup,  ,   and   saw very few visitors on Sunday.
 
 "We did not celebrate the beginning of a new year this time owing to the commodity crisis gripping our state. The UNC-sponsored economic blockade entered its 61st day today (Sunday)," said W Binoy Singh, a resident of Imphal.
 
 "Why should we celebrate when our people are suffering? There was no point in celebrating the day. Instead, we prayed for peace and communal harmony," Binoy added.
 
 In his New Year greetings, chief minister Okram   urged people to shun their ego and make Manipur united and stronger. He said improved connectivity and communication would help the state catch up in the race of development.
 
 Pointing out that there had been administrative improvements in the interior parts of the state last year, Ibobi Singh said 2017 would bring more 'balanced' development. "May the New Year bring peace, prosperity and happiness to all," Ibobi Singh said.
 
 Governor   said, "The new year is all about making resolutions and looking into the future. We look forward to a better tomorrow based on our experience and achievements of the past."
