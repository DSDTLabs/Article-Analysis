BENGALURU: The Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of   (ComedK) entrance exam (UGET) for undergraduate engineering courses will go on as scheduled, said the consortium on Monday. The exam is slated to begin on May 14. 

 Responding to the government’s decision to scrap all other entrance examinations to professional courses, including those conducted by ComedK and private universities, M R  , secretary of Karnataka Professional Colleges’ Foundation, said there’s no question of scrapping the ComedK entrance exam. “There needs to be more clarity on what the government wants to do. There is a law governing the medical and dental exams and admissions so there is no reason to hold multiple tests for those courses. But there’s no binding Act yet for engineering courses and so all entrance tests for engineering courses will continue as per schedule,” said Jayaram.
 
 The bill was tabled in the assembly by higher education minister   on March 22. The cabinet introduced an amendment to bring a common entrance examination (CET) for professional courses, including engineering, medical and dental undergraduate and postgraduate seats. While the amendment will be common for all courses, the government will be initially introducing the new Act for medical and dental courses only, in the backdrop of the national eligibility cum entrance test (NEET) introduced for medical and dental courses.
 
 For engineering courses, however, the existing seat sharing matrix will continue till there is a nation-wide NEET like exam for engineering courses too.
