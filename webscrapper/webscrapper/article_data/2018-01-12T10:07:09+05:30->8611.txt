AGRA: The long-awaited dream of Agra residents to have a separate modern gynecology wing at the  , one of the district's premier medical facilities, seems to be converting into a reality this month. 

 The hospital authorities, on Thursday, said that the newly-built extension will have modular operation theatres (OT), ultrasound facilities, a 100-bedded ward and another special ward for new born babies. 
 
 There would be over 12   and one   in the out-patient department of the wing in the initial months.
 
 The institute, which provides optimum healthcare to thousands of Agra residents, sees a footfall of nearly 200 patients coming for gynecology-related ailments every day, out of which 30 are admitted. 
 
 Female patients had to earlier wander to various other departments for consultations, medical tests, ultrasounds and deliveries. All of these facilities will be available under one wing now. Hospital authorities also said that the wing was slated to start last year but got delayed following an incident in August. A local committee was later formed to complete the inspection process of the newly-constructed wing. 
 
 Dr  , chief medical superintendent of S N Medical College, said, "The inspection committee has submitted its final report. The wing will soon be operational. Earlier, we had only a single OT but now there will be four new OTs for female patients."
