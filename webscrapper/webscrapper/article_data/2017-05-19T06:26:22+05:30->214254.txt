SAHARSA: Police on Thursday recovered 30 cartons of liquor and seized four vehicles, including two SUVs, at Sapaha village under   outpost of Sour Bazaar police station in the district.
 
    Subodh   said the liquor bottles were hidden in the basement of a building at the village. Police also arrested four persons in this connection.
  
  The entire Kosi division, particularly   and Supaul districts, has turned a safe haven for liquor smugglers. Only two days back, the excise officials had recovered illicit liquor worth Rs 6 lakh from   in Saharsa district. On May 10, the police had recovered 84 bottles of India Made Foreign Liquor at   here and arrested one person.
  
  Police sources said the state government’s much-hyped prohibition, announced in April last year, has very little impact in the region. “All kinds of liquors are easily available in the market and the same can be easily accessed under home delivery system. The only difference that the new legislation has brought about is that liquor is somewhat beyond the economic capacity of poor drunkards,” said a police source.
  
  The officer said porous borders with Nepal play a crucial part in increasing the unchecked flow of Nepali liquor in the Kosi region.
