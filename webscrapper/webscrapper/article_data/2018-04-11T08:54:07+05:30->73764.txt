CHANDIGARH: Former Prime Minister and   alumnus Dr   will be back in his alma mater after a gap of 52 years as a teacher. Dr Singh would deliver the first Prof S B Rangnekar Memorial Oration on “The Seventh Anniversary of Our Independence — Strengthening the Roots of Our Democracy” as Jawaharlal Nehru Chair professor at Law Auditorium,  , at 10am on Wednesday.

 After he left teaching at PU in 1966, he visited the university twice. On both occasions, he was awarded honorary degree by PU. Dr Singh was awarded honorary causa degree of Doctor of Literature on March 12, 1983, and then honorary causa degree of Doctor of Laws on March 11, 2009.
  
  
 After delivering the lecture, he would visit the department of economics, where he was a student and a faculty member as well. Since it would be difficult for him to climb the stairs to reach the department, which is on the second floor, arrangements have been made at the ground floor for him to meet the faculty members and students of the department. From there, he would go to Guru Teg Bahadur Reading Hall, which would later house the library of 3,500 books donated by him. He would spend 10 minutes and then leave for CRRID.
 
 Dr Singh accepted the chair professorship at PU in 2015. The department of economics has Jawaharlal Nehru Chair. A parliamentary panel had cleared the decks for the   to accept the professorship.
 
 It is after two years of accepting the chair professorship that Dr Singh would come to the university to deliver a lecture. There is also a faculty room of Dr Singh as the Jawaharlal Nehru Chair professor at the department.
 
 Prof Rangnekar taught Dr Singh at PU and was later his colleague in the same department, when Dr Singh was the faculty member and Dr Rangnekar the head of the department. Prof Rangnekar built the department with a great deal of zeal, passion and vision. He made it into a well know centre for studies in economic development and planning.
