PITHORAGARH: Farmers in Pithoragarh district who have been agitating for over two months for waiving off their loans, declared on Monday that they will conduct 'mass self-immolation' on October 2 if their demands were not met.   “BJP leaders had announced in their manifesto during the 2014 elections that they will waive off loans taken by farmers if they are unable to repay them. But after coming to power, they have forgotten all about it. We have had enough now. If the government does not agree to relieve us of our miseries, we have decided that we will do so on our own by immolating ourselves,” said Subhash Joshi, secretary of Kisan Sangathan, a body representing the area’s farmers whose members also staged a dharna at the district magistrate’s office on Monday. Joshi added that five farmers including himself will be conducting the self-immolation on Gandhi Jayanti.    "We have submitted numerous memorandums to the state government but not a single official has come to talk to us which shows this government’s apathy towards farmers. That is why we have been forced to consider this extreme step,” Joshi said.    Notably, the first farmer death in Uttarakhand this year due to banks allegedly exerting pressure on farmers to repay their loans happened in Pithoragarh on June 16 when Surendra Singh, a 58-year-old farmer from Doldungri village in Berinag block of Pithoragarh district who had been under a debt of Rs 1.25 lakh committed suicide by consuming poison. Since then at least 5 more deaths have been reported in various parts of the state where farmers either committed suicide or died due to cardiac arrest which their family members alleged was brought about because of stress regarding repayment of loans.
