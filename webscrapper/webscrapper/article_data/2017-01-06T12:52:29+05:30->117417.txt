BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday ordered notice to the government and BBMP in response to a PIL filed by former DGP C Dinakar. He has sought cancellation of the proposed   on Indiranagar 100 Feet Road on January 15. 

 A division bench headed by Chief Justice   ordered notice to the commissioner, tourism department, and N A Harris, Shanthinagar MLA. The bench has asked the government advocate to seek instructions and respond to Dinakar's petition. The next hearing is on January 10. 
 
 Dinakar claimed that the proposed Open Street Festival on 100 Feet Road, which serves as an arterial road for those headed to   and Whitefield and runs through a residential area, would only inconvenience the public. He contended that the event will damage the stretch as shamianas and stalls will be set up.
 
  When the chief justice pointed to a similar festival on MG Road last year, the former top cop remarked that the event actually caused damage to MG Road. Regarding public inconvenience, the CJ noted that when roads are closed due to such festivals, medical emergencies and other exigencies have to be taken care of. 
 
  Dinakar stated that the concept of Open Street Festival is prevalent in western countries to showcase the attractions of a place. However, they are organized in areas which see negligible traffic, he said.
