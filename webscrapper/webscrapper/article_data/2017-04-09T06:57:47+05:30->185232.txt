HUBBALLI: The lorry strike may not have had much impact on the lives of the common man in the twin cities as the supply of essential commodities has remained unaffected. But the strike has seriously affected porters and daily wage   of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee ( ) in Amargol here.

 Without any activities and movement of trucks, APMC has been wearing a deserted look. Many porters ( ) and daily wage labours, who otherwise used to be busy attending to consignments, are now sitting idle. “Of late, it has become difficult for us to make ends meet. We are waiting for the strike to be called off at the earliest. Otherwise, we will be in deep trouble,” said   of Sri Siddharoodh Hamali Karmikar Sangha at the APMC.
 
 Over 400 porters who work at APMC and their families are the worst hit. “On normal days, we earn Rs 500-600. But because of the strike, we have not been able to earn Rs 100-200 per day,” he said, explaining the reason: “We don’t have work in hand as there is no loading and unloading of foodgrains and other consignments. Trucks from Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have stopped coming here because of the strike.”
 
 Satish Ambiger, who has been a head loader at APMC for the past six years, said he has not been able to get Rs 50 to 100 a day. “We are facing uncertainty. When will the situation be normal? If the strike continues for some more days, then all our families will be in dire straits,” he added. 
 
 Another porter Parshwanath echoed Satish’s concerns. 
 
 Sources said APMC is witnessing loading and unloading of local market goods. Small goods carriers arrive with 35-50 packets of rice, dal and other foodgrains. By attending to these loads, head loaders earn Rs 60-100. They charge Rs 2 to handle 25kg bags.
