Noida: At least four students of   school had vomited and complained of stomach ache a day before 190 students fell ill after having food and water at the institution on April 5, parents have said.

 The revelation has led parents to speculate that the illness among their children was the result of contaminated water at the school. Some of the parents said their children had complained of stomach ache, although they had not taken food offered in the school canteen.
 
 The allegation assumes all the more significance as a recent test of water samples collected from the school has revealed that the water is potable and poses no health hazard. The parents said they were hardly surprised with the test result as the water had been collected by a health department team after the tanks had been cleaned. 
 
 “The children who fell ill a day before many students complained of stomach ache were from Classes VI and VII. They were vomiting and were sent home after some medication at the school,” said a parent.
 
 “Contaminated water is most likely to have caused the illness among the children. Some students who hadn’t taken food had also vomited and complained of stomach ache. The test results wouldn’t yield anything. The tanks were cleaned before the samples were collected,” he added.
 
 Chief medical officer Anurag Bhargava said the test report had confirmed water at Step by Step was safe for drinking. He said the health department would soon issue an advisory asking all schools to get their water samples tested.
 
 Currently, students have been told to bring food and water from home. Step by Step would earlier provide food to its students in the canteen and did not allow them bring tiffin from home. Since the April 5 incident, the school has installed new water dispensers on each floor.
 
 In a statement in response to a TOI query, Step by Step said: “We continue to fully cooperate with the authorities as they investigate the matter.”
