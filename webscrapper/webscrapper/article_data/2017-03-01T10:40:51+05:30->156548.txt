NAGPUR: It seems that the Maharashtra government is favouring ousted city bus operator —   (VNIL), which has duped the civic body of over Rs132 crore by not paying royalty and other mandatory taxes. Reason: the government is yet to give its nod to Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s request to go for arbitration to recover the dues. 

 Confirming this, a senior official from NMC’s transport department said that since 2015 the civic body has communicated at least six times with the urban development ministry seeking permission to go for arbitration. 
 
 In 2007, the   had appointed the private firm VNIL to operate city bus service. However, the private firm has reportedly defaulted royalty and even defaulted   taxes. 
 
 As per motor vehicles rules, VNIL was to deposit 3.5% of total revenue as passenger tax and children nutrition fund with RTO. VNIL has not rendered the accounts so total revenue could not be ascertained, nor submitted the receipts of having paid taxes, the officer said.
 
 Against 470 buses that VNIL had agreed to ply on city roads, not even half that number actually plied. According to the officer, nearly 190 road permits were secured from RTO to enable these buses to ply but many of these routes were not serviced at all causing inconvenience to the public.
 
 In the past too, the chief minister’s office in Mumbai had intervened and stopped the Regional Transport Office (RTO) Nagpur move to detain VNIL’s buses after the private firm defaulted the mandatory taxes though it collected from the passengers travelled in the city buses. 
 
 Though VNIL officials were not available for comments, official sources said there is no question arises to clear the dues. The NMC has not paid the students' concessions, which too runs into over Rs100 crore. 
 
 Despite repeated attempts, chief minister   was not available for comments. He did not even respond to the text message.
