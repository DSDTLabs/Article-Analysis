Tumakuru: The toll in the food poisoning incident at   near   in   rose to four on Sunday with the school security guard's death. 

 Ramesh, 45, had been battling for life at the Tumakuru government hospital since Wednesday night. He, along with three students, had developed health complications after having food served at the hostel. While the three students died on Thursday morning, Ramesh was kept in the intensive care unit. "His condition worsened gradually and he ceased to respond to treatment," said district surgeon Veerabhadraiah. 
 
 Ramesh's death has raised more questi ons on the nature of poisoning and increased pressure on police to unravel the mystery behind the tragedy. Ramesh, a resident of Hosalli near Huliyar, was married to Kenchamma and the couple had two children. 
 
  Ramesh owned two acres of land, but since water was not available, he gave up farming and started working as a labourer. It was then that some well-wishers suggested he approach school president   for a job. He joined the school as a security guard a month ago. "Ramesh died even before he got his first salary. He joined the school to sustain his family. He was the sole breadwinner; we don't even know who's responsible for his death," Kenchamma said. 
 
  The relatives and villagers staged a protest placing Ramesh's body in front of the school in the evening, seeking compensation. 
 
  School president and former MLA Kiran Kumar and school secretary Kavitha surrendered before Huliyaru police on Saturday night. They were produced before the Tiptur JMFC judge who granted them conditional bail.
