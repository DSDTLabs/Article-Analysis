JAIPUR/ALWAR: The   Arakshan Sangarsh   on Sunday announced to revive their agitation from May 15. Four days ago, the Samiti had given an ultimatum to the state government to provide the five per cent MBC (more backward classes) reservation within the 50% reservation cap by bifurcating 21% OBC quota in the state or they will launch an agitation. 

  pointed out that so far talks with the state government have yielded no results and   were left with no other option except to go on the path of agitation again if the government fails to meet their demands.
 
 Gujjar leader Col Kirori Singh Bainsla on Sunday said if the state government does not provide the five per cent MBC reservation within the 50% reservation cap, they will revive their agitation from May 15. 
 
 A meeting of Gujjar leaders was held at Pilukapura on May 6 for taking the decision on reviving their agitation. Gujjars will hold a mahapanchayat on May 15. The leaders unanimously decided to revive their agitation in the panchayat to be held at Adda village of Bayana. 
 
 Bainsla said that this time around, the agitation will be ‘aar paar ki ladai’ (fight to finish). The Gujjars will continue agitating till the government fulfils their demand. 
 
 Gujjar leaders pointed out that the central government had constituted the Justice Rohini commission to explore the possibility of bifurcation of the OBC quota. The Gujjars wanted this process to be expedited as they claimed that the appointment in the government is now going on and the MBC is facing various problems even in obtaining the one per cent MBC quota.
