LUDHIANA: A day after a 40-year-old woman was arrested for the murder of her elderly mother-in-law, police said she had promised to pay Rs 50,000 to her friend and her accomplice to execute the killing. 

 
 Surjeet Kaur, 70, was found brutally murdered at her house in   on   on Monday. A day later, police arrested Jyoti — Surjeet Kaur’s daughter-in-law — her friend Barkha and their accomplice   for committing the crime. 
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP IV)   said, “Jyoti had promised to pay Rs 50,000 to Barkha and Rajveer. She told them that she would make the payment from Surjeet’s money and keep her jewellery for herself. The weapon used in the crime has been recovered.” 
 
 Police said   and Jyoti hardly enjoyed cordial relations. Fed up of her scoldings, Jyoti, along with Barkha and Rajveer, hatched the murder plan. 
 
 Jyoti met Rajveer through Barkha, who lives in her neighbourhood. “Jyoti’s call records showed that she had called up Barkha and Rajveer immediately after the brutal attack on her mother-in-law. She spilled the beans during interrogation,” said a cop. 
 
 The murder case was lodged on the complaint of Manjeet Singh, son of Surjeet Kaur.
