SURAT: There is some good news for   residents visiting railway station.   (WR) has decided to roll back its decision to implement hike in platform ticket fare, which was likely to come into effect from April 1. 

 The decision by divisional railway manager (DRM) to increase platform ticket fare from Rs10 to Rs20 had faced serious criticism from general public, social organizations and Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI). The TOI had raised the issue to highlight the concerns of the residents. 
 
 In a reply to an RTI activist, divisional railway manager (DRM) of WR,   said, ‘Surat is special and we wish to make it a model station. During summer rush, the station is so crowded that a mishap can occur any time” 
 
 Jain further added, “It is only Surat where rates of platform tickets have been increased. No travelling passenger will be affected. The idea is to lessen the crowd coming to receive and drop passengers. Why don’t you complain about airports where charges are over Rs1,00. For an occasional visit to the station, additional Rs10 is no big deal.” 
 
 Member of passenger service committee (PSC) of  , Rakesh Shah, told TOI, “I was constantly following the issue with top authorities and had even talked with the railway minister. It was only for Surat that the DRM had decided to hike the platform ticket rates. Today, I was conveyed that the WR has rolled back its decision on hiking the platform ticket rates.”
 
 Shah pointed out that increasing railway platform ticket rate is not a solution to de-congest platforms from unwanted people. Shah stated that the Diamond City has the highest migrant population and that the city also gets floating population due to its textile industry. The migrant population is concentrated in Limbayat, Udhana, Bhestan, Pandesara and Dindoli.
