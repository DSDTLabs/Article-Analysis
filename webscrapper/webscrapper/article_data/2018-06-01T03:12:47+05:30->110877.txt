NEW DELHI: Two men have been arrested for the   of a 21-year-old   whose body was recovered from a river near   a month ago. A missing case was registered at the GTB Enclave police station by her family members, said the police. 

 Officers said Sanjay (24) and Varun (25) had lured the woman from her home at Dilshad Garden by promising to take her on a car ride. Instead, they went to a hotel near   Phase III, had a party and then Sanjay raped the woman in a room he had booked at the hotel.
 
 When the woman threatened to register a complaint against them, Sanjay promised marriage and took her to a car parked near the hotel where the duo strangled the woman. The two men then drove to the Ram Ganga river and dumped the body.
 
 The local police recovered the body from the river on April 23 and efforts were made to identify it. 
 
 The parents recognised her a few days later after cops saw the woman’s profile on the police network and contacted them. However, Sanjay and Varun kept evading cops. They were finally tracked near Dilshad Garden and caught. The police said both had confessed.
 
 Sanjay also stayed in the same colony and had befriended the woman a year ago, said the police. The victim’s father works in a private company.
