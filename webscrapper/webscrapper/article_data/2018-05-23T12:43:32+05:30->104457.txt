DHARWAD: The state government is seriously considering stalling/withdrawing grants to private aided schools and PU colleges which have poor passing percentage in SSLC and PUC examination for five years in a row.

 Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education)   has written to all district DDPIs to prepare a list of private aided schools and PU colleges which have registered a passing percentage below the district’s average for five consecutive years and send it to the government. 
 
 The letter warns that the DDPIs who do not not comply with the instruction will be held responsible for the lapse.
 
 The letter comes after a private aided school in Bengaluru Rural district filed a case in a court questioning the DDPI’s move to stop grant to the school for its   being less than the district’s average. The school asked why it was alone targeted and why no action was being taken against other schools performing poorly.
 
 BJP MLC S V Sankanur condemned the government’s move and said the government was acting in an unscientific and inhuman manner by misusing the power accorded to it under section 53 of Karnataka Education Act 1983. The Act empowers the government to stop/ withdraw the grant-in-aid.
 
 In a letter to the Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education), Sankanur has urged the government not to stop/withdraw grants to the schools and colleges and cancel the rule framed to that effect. 
 
 He has also warned that teachers, non-teaching staff and the managing committees of private aided schools and PU Colleges will launch a statewide agitation if the government went ahead with its plan to stop grants.
