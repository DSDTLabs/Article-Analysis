PUNE: Tree activists staged a late-night demonstration on Aundh Road on Friday to protest against the cutting down of an old neem tree along the road. Calling it the ‘Jagte Raho Andolan’, the protest brought together scores of activists, local residents and environment conscious citizens, including tree activist  . 

 The agitation was against the poor approach of   towards preservation of trees along Aundh Road and the alleged lack of will on the part of the civic body to implement the provisions of the Tree (Protection and Preservation) Act. 
 
 The protesters were mobilized on Friday evening when the neem tree along Raj Bhavan side of Aundh Road was found cut by activists. Shocked, they immediately informed officials of Chatushrungi police about it. Some local people, including those from the nearby vasti were seen weeping at the merciless chopping of the old tree.
 
 The gathered activists alleged the tree cutting had been done at the behest of officials of the garden department of the civic body. 
 
 Trees along Aundh Road have been facing the axe for the past two years. A few trees were found damaged by activist Vaishali Patkar a few weeks ago. 
 
 The matter has been taken up with municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar, also the chairman of the tree authority. 
 
 On Thursday, the activists took up the issue with mayor Mukta Tilak.
