MUMBAI: A baby boy died after falling from a French window of a 14th-floor flat near   on Saturday morning. It was around 9 am that 22-month-old   was playing in the flat at  . Ten other family members were present in the flat when he crawled towards the window, slid open the glass and clambered out unnoticed.
 
 The police said that Soham’s maternal grandfather,  , realized what had happened when he stepped out of the house and found his grandson lying in a pool of blood in the building compound.

The boy would have lost his balance.”
  
 Around the time that Soham would have fallen, his grandmother was offering prayers. Besides, his parents, his maternal uncle, aunt and a few others were in the flat when his grandfather stepped out to go for a walk in the locality. “He immediately alerted the others who were still in the house. The boy was rushed to   in Bandra where he died of multiple injuries,” said the officer.
  
 A security guard at the building said that the residents learnt about the tragedy only when they saw the toddler’s family members rushing him to hospital. The shocked residents of the building refused to speak about the incident.
