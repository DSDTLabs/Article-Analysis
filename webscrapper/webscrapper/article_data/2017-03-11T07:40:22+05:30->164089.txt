VADODARA: This Holi, you won’t be able to take a dip in the river waters around the city after playing with colours. 

 Wary of the incidents of drowning, the district administration has banned bathing in Narmada and   rivers at several locations on Sunday and Monday. Strict vigilance will be kept at these spots to ensure that no one takes a plunge in the river. 
 
 “Many incidents of drowning have been reported at these rivers during Holi in the past. It’s dangerous for people to take bath at certain spots so we have put a ban on entering the river waters for two days,” said district collector,  . 
 
 The spots that have been banned for bathing are Sindhrot checkdam, Lanchanpur in Savli, Mahi River and Nareshwar in Karjan. Executive magistrates and policemen will be posted at these spots to ensure that people stay away from the river.
 
 “If anyone flouts the notification, action will be taken against them,” Sehra added. 
 
 Congress has, however, objected to the ban. 
 
 “The district administration should have made proper arrangements including keeping lifeboats, lifeguards and ambulances at these spots to ensure that people bathe safely. Instead of that they have simply banned visiting these spots. Thousands of citizens bathe in the river waters after celebrating Holi and enjoy the festival,” said Pragnesh Tewar, spokesperson, Congress, central Gujarat.
 
 “If accidents happen on road, does the government find ways to reduce them or ban vehicles? If the ban is not revoked, we will protest against it,” Tewar added.
