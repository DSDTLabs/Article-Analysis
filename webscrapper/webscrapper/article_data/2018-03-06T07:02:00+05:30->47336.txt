CHANDIGARH: Students of department of Indian theatre, Panjab University, Chandigarh, continued to boycott   for the sixth day in a row on Monday. The students marched in the campus demanding new and regular faculty for the department. 

 The university authorities after a meeting conveyed to the students that they were ready to call the guest faculty suggested by the students of the department to deliver lectures in the department. However, the students claim that the chairperson of the department is “inefficient” and want a new chairperson for the department. 
 
 “Though the authorities have agreed to our demands of getting the guest faculty for our department, they have refused to take any action against the chairperson,” said  , a student of the Indian theatre department. The students had alleged that there have been no regular classes in the past few months. No teacher stays back after 5pm for the rehearsals, alleged students.
 
 When talked to the chairperson  , she said, “It is very unfortunate that after working so hard for the department, I have to listen to such complaints. We are here for the students and resolve their issues. The department is for the students. The authority will look into the demand of the students. The sad part is that the protesting students never approached me with their problems.”
 
 The students also said the authorities were to convene a meeting in their presence, but did the contrary. Commenting on this allegation,   said the dean student welfare   and other officials had met the students before conducting the meeting to take their suggestions and have agreed to their demands. 
 
 The students on Thursday had locked their department but after the intervention of the PU vice-chancellor Prof  , the students had opened the lock of the department and let the faculty in. However, they continued boycotting classes.
