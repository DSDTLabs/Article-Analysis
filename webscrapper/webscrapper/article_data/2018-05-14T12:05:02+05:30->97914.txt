LUDHIANA: The residents of   have been complaining against the   condition in the area for a long time in the absence of proper sweepers. The   officials however rued that since the contract with the private contractor came to an end, sweepers are not available in the area and they are yet to float fresh tenders.

 In two other areas,   and Rishi Nagar the residents heaved a sigh of relief because in Rajguru Nagar the area councillor has arranged for private sweepers, while LIT will pay the charges to them. Similarly Rishi Nagar falls in the ward of Mayor Balkar Sandhu and he was also not satisfied with sanitation in the area which was why he made arrangements from MC. But the residents of SBS Nagar are still waiting for the desired relief. 
 
 One of the residents   complained that the sanitation contract had come to end almost a year ago and LIT officials kept on extending the contract for few months, but sanitation was not up to mark. He said the sweepers were hardly concerned to sweep the roads. Echoing the same, another resident of the area, Malkit Singh said the locality is included among the posh areas of the city, but if posh areas suffer like this, then the condition of other areas can be well judged. He rued that authorities neglect their area. 
 
 While admitting the executive engineer of LIT Boota Ram said that they will shortly float the tenders to arrange contractor for maintaining cleanliness in the area. He said recently they have floated tenders for garbage lifting and next will be for sweepers.
 
 
 
 A resident of SBS Nagar has raised the issue of violation of building bylaws in area. He alleged that people have violated the bylaws by not leaving the front line of house uncovered and LIT authorities are sleeping. He has made a complaint to the chief vigilance officer and principal secretary. However the LIT officials claimed that they will look into the matter and suitable action will be taken against the violators.
