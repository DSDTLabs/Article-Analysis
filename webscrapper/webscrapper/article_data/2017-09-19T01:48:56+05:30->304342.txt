Mohali: A large number of farmers, led by Bhartiya Kisan Union ( ), Lakhowal, marched from Gurdwara Amb Sahib of Phase VIII towards Chandigarh 

 The farmers tried to move towards the chief minister’s house but Chandigarh Police did not allow them to do so and were stopped at a barrier.
 
 BKU president Ajmer Singh Lakhowal said the payment against cultivation of sugarcane upto Rs 100 crore to the farmers by the government has been stopped and same should be issued immediately.
 
 He said instead of suicides, farmers should resolve their issues by struggling. He said that due to non-payment for produces like sugarcane, potato and other crops, the farmers are not being able to pay their debts. Left with no options, the indebted farmers are committing suicides.
 
 “The farmers have spent all of their savings in growing sugarcane, cattle, paddy and other crops. Government should make efforts to reduce the prices of fertilizers, diesel and seeds. The expenditure of the farmers has increased and the income has decreased. So the farmers have no choice but to commit suicide. Governments must pay attention to this,” he said.
 
 He said, Rs 500 fine which the Government has imposed on stubble burning, is not justified. “The burning of straw does not spread pollution as is spread by large factories, he said.
 
 He also demanded that government should provide a compensation of Rs 35,000 per acre to the farmers in case of any natural calamity. The government should make efforts to stop damage done to crops by the animals. Lakhowal said, he would interact with the Union government to implement Swaminathan report.
 
 The sugarcane farmers who had come for dharna started taking chunks of sugarcane.
