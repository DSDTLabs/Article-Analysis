KOHIMA: The 15-year alliance between the ruling Naga People's Front (NPF) and BJP is not dead, chief minister TR Zeliang said on Wednesday. NPF has not closed its doors to BJP despite the fact that the two parties are fighting the election as rivals, he added. 

 "The trust (between the two parties) is still there. I have a minister from BJP (P Paiwang Konyak) who is still a part of my cabinet and an adviser from the BJP (TN Lotha) in the rank of a cabinet minister," Zeliang said here after launching the NPF's campaign here at the party office. Putting the ball in BJP's court, he said, "It is for them to decide what to do next."
 
 BJP state president Visasolie Lhoungu was also not averse to the rekindling of ties. "The alliance has not been scrapped as yet. We have not severed the ties with NPF and the door is still open for them," he said.
 
 The sudden turnaround has thrown the contest wide open, leading to speculation about the post-poll scenario and the fate of former NPF leader and present chief ministerial candidate of the BJP-NDPP alliance Neiphiu Rio. The Northern Angami-II seat has already gone to Rio after all his opponents withdrew from the contest.
 
 When asked if a post-poll alliance could be struck in case of a hung assembly, Zeliang said, "Let's see." But he quickly corrected himself, saying, "There will be no hung assembly. NPF will get majority on its own." A more forthright Lhoungu said, "That will be decided after the election." According to both Zeliang and Lhoungu, ties between the two parties went sour over a pre-poll seat sharing agreement.
