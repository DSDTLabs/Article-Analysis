In real life though, the actress had no doubts as she said an emphatic yes to her boyfriend and entrepreneur Vishnu S Nair to get engaged on Sunday in Kochi.

 The Bharatanatyam student reveals that the duo’s love story was far from anything she’s done in films. “We met three and a half years ago when I went to inaugurate one of Vishnu’s business ventures. We became good friends and eventually fell in love,” says a visibly-chuffed Samskruthy. “There was no filmy style or fairy tale proposal. We knew that we were meant for each other, we had that understanding.”
 
  
  
 
 Samskruthy says that both their families were supportive of their decision. “My dad is a very open-minded person. Both our parents knew it from the very beginning and their only concern was our happiness,” explains the 19-year-old actress.
 
  
  
 
 So, when is the big day? “The wedding won’t happen anytime soon. Currently, I am completing my diploma course in Bharatanatyam and will be pursuing Masters after that. Dance is my passion and I want to study further,” she says. On her acting career, Samskruthy says that she’s keen to take up good projects.
  
  
 
 Meanwhile, Samskruthy’s father, Dr Govindaraj Shenoy, says he is elated at his daughter’s decision. “Marriage will happen when they are both ready to take the relationship forward,” he says.
