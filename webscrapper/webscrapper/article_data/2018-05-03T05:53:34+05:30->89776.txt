MUMBAI: Until 1998,  , alias   (42), was a smalltime robber. The Kherwadi resident, who hailed from Kerala, was barely known in the world of crime. His fortunes changed when he was sent to jail in a case of attempted robbery. There he met D K Rao, alias Bora, Chhota Rajan's most trusted aide. Rao had heard of Tangappa's shooting skills and took an immediate liking to him. He also told   about the latter. 

 "By the late noughties, Tangappa was working directly under Rajan. He was the hitman of choice for the dreaded gangster," said a crime branch officer. "Just a few months before Dey's killing was planned, Tangappa was released on bail. Tangappa was in Kerala, when Rajan called him, telling him to return to Mumbai as he had an assignment for him. Speaking on Skype, Rajan gave him a description of the target (Dey) and his motorcycle, with its licence plate number."
 
 On the day of the crime, Tangappa shot five rounds at Dey, of which three hit him. "Tangappa is very shrewd. After his arrest, he told the police that he regretted killing Dey. He said that had he known that the target was a journalist, he wouldn't have killed him," said an officer.
