GHAZIABAD: The construction of the   being undertaken by the irrigation department has been stalled for the past fortnight apparently because the   municipal corporation is yet to remove a water pipeline from the culvert.

 According to an irrigation department official, the delay on the part of the municipal corporation will make it difficult for it to meet the deadline for the construction of the two bridges that are coming up in the area.
 
 The under-construction bridges on   are crucial to ensuring seamless flow of traffic from   to   and vice-versa. 
 
 “The Kanawani bridge connects Vasundhara to Indirapuram and at present, it is being used by commuters from Indirapuram and also from the Hindon barrage road,” said SK Chauhan, executive engineer and in-charge Indirapuram, GDA. “So, we conceived a plan for constructing two new bridges apart from strengthening the existing one. For that, the irrigation department demanded a sum of Rs 19 crore, of which we have already made a payment of Rs 12 crore to the irrigation department,” added Chauhan.
 
 The irrigation department claimed that 40 per cent of the work had been complete but it had to be held up for the past fortnight.
 
 “A water pipeline is passing through the existing Kanawani bridge, which needs to be relocated. For that, we had written to the   repeatedly to relocate the pipeline but the GMC did not respond to our requests,” said Devesh, assistant engineer in the UP irrigation department.
 
 “We might have to extend the March 2018 deadline under these circumstances,” added Devesh.
