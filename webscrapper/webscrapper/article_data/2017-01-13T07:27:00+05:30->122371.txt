Chandigarh: While the Haryana government is making efforts to attract entrepreneurs from out of state, industrialists in Rohtak have been resenting poor law and order situation due to harassment by villagers in Sampla-Beri area.

 A delegation of Sampla-Beri Road Industrial Welfare Society headed by Yash Pal Garg on January 10 met Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Pankaj Nain seeking safety of their units and workers.
 
 Garg alleged that local goons had been forcing the industrialists to employ manpower provided by them in addition to the forced hiring of contract carriage. Besides, they have also alleged extortion attempts made by the locals. 
 
 Earlier, some of the shopkeepers had also been alleging extortion calls from local gangsters. Three shopkeepers had suffered bullet injuries in an attack by anti-social elements as they had refused to pay the extortion money.
 
 Rohtak SP Nain confirmed the meeting with the industrialists. “We have already addressed their grievances and cases have been registered in complaints given by them. Investigations are in progress and we are hopeful of making the arrests in the next couple of days,” he said.
 
 According to information, during the meeting with the SP, Garg and other industrialists elaborated on the incidents in which local goons had attacked factory workers while insisting to park their vehicles on their premises.
 
 Gulshan Dang, head of traders body in Rohtak, also flayed government’s failure in providing safety and security to businessmen and industrialists. “There is point in asking for more investment until you give good working atmosphere. It is the government’s job to ensure safety and security of traders and industrialists. It needs to act now,” he said.
