COIMBATORE: A 36-year-old woman committed suicide by hanging at her residence at   on Saturday evening after learning that 1.32 crore she invested in the share market business through her friend was at stake and that she had to invest more to recover the losses. 

 The rural police have booked five people for abetment of suicide. Police have formed a team to arrest the five who are at large.

 Last week, Jothilakshmi told Vishalakshi that the share market business was a failure and she could not even return her investment.

 Unable to bear the pressure, Vishalakshi hanged herself using a sari. Police found a suicide note in her residence that said five people had swindled Rs 1.32 crore from her.
