MUMBAI: Psychiatry and crime are often interlinked. But whether an undiagnosed mental condition could have led   (20) to allegedly stab his mother to death should be thoroughly evaluated, city doctors feel. 

 Ganore, the son of a police inspector, is an engineering dropout, who told cops that he was often rebuked by his mother for his poor academic performance. He told the police his father too was bearing the brunt of his mother's "quarrelsome nature". A source said that during interrogation at the   station, he maintained a calm demeanour and responded to every question.
 
 The youngster may have shown no remorse so far, but psychiatrists caution against making a judgment based on superficial signs. "Killing one's mother is a far rarer crime than killing one's father. And remorse is not always skin-deep, it is soul-deep. His behaviour immediately after the crime may not indicate what is exactly going on his mind," said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. "An attempt must be made to look through the layers of his personality."
 
 Psychiatrist Dr   said that in many instances there's some mental disorder that perhaps went unnoticed at home. "It is not unusual for family members to miss out on signs of depression, mood swings or angry outbursts."
 
 But a psychiatrist from a public hospital said that notwithstanding the presence of a mental ailment, there is always the need for a trigger. "On the spur of the moment, one may not be in a position to comprehend the consequences of one's action."
