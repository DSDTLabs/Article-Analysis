LUCKNOW: Terming the   party as opportunist and deceitful outfit peddling soft Hindutva, controversial SP leader   has kicked off another row. Azmi, who is SP’s Maharshtra chief, sent a letter to party president   Yadav urging him not to enter into an alliance with Congress, else he would be compelled to field his candidates against it in Maharashtra.

 
 “On one hand, Congress helped BJP ally Shiv Sena in Bhiwandi Mahanagar Palika mayor election, on the other, they want SP’s support in   … how is that possible,” he questioned while talking to TOI on phone from Mumbai.
 
 Azmi said he would do everything to express his reservations over a pact with Congress. “If need be, I will come to Lucknow, and tell our national president how Congress has repeatedly back-stabbed us in Maharashtra,” he said.
 
 Azmi said that he was aware that SP does not have a strong foothold in every state and will need support of other parties but forcefully added that party cadre in Maharashtra were no longer willing to accept Congress as an alliance partner.
 
 In a two-page letter to Akhilesh, he cited a series of past instances when Congress took SP for a ride, and questioned the need for joining hands with such a party. Azmi questioned the manner in which Congress included SP chief among its star campaigners for Karnataka assembly elections without his consent.
 
 “If the party still decides to go ahead with an alliance with Congress in Maharashtra for upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections, then I will be left with no option but to field candidates against it,” reads the letter, a copy of which is with TOI. It is not the first time when talk of alliance with Congress has drawn criticism within SP.
 
 Party patriarch   had openly expressed his disapproval over tie-up with Congress ahead of 2017 UP polls. After the humiliating defeat, Mulayam had said that SP would have faired better had it contested the election all by itself.
