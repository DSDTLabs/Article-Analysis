Jaipur: The exit from the railway station or bus stand gives the first impression of a city to a visitor.

 As many government offices, schools and social groups celebrated the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Monday by organising cleanliness drives, the exit part of the central bus stand and bus depot and the Jaipur Junction railway station were seen heaped in garbage.
 
 TOI visited various parts of the city, including the area outside the railway station, bus stand and the depot near the Rajasthan state roadways transport corporation (RSRTC), and found that the menace was very real despite a high-decibel campaign.
 
 Though the platforms of the railway station were clean with authorities putting in place a system, including 24x7 sanitation workers and contractural workers, for the job, one could find garbage strewn around just a few meters away from the reservation office and the station exit.
 
 When asked about it, a RPF jawan, he said, “This is under the purview of the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). We don’t let tea vendors and others stand here or leave garbage. But they still run small trade and sell tea and snacks, etc.”
 
 Similarly, a heap of waste was found outside the bus depot situated outside the RSRTC headquarters.
 
 In many colonies and main circles, waste and filth could be seen and people complained that the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) campaign was a mere eye wash. “Roadside eateries and others dump garbage on the corner of roads. It is high time that the JMC and authorities came up with stern penalties and made cleanliness a regular affair,” said S N Sharma, a retired government employee residing in Tara Nagar area of Jhotwara.
