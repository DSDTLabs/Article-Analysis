PANAJI: Former chief minister Digambar   and the legal heir of   family appeared before the North Goa sessions court on Tuesday. The case concerned the renewal of a mining lease after condonation of delay. 

 Speaking to TOI, special public prosecutor G D Kirtani said that Kamat and   have been asked to furnish a personal bond in the Kadnekar mining case.
 
 The special investigation team (SIT) had filed the chargesheet against Kamat, government officials, and others for allowing the condonation of delay in filling applications for the renewal of mining leases, which resulted in losses to the state exchequer to the tune of Rs 135 crore.
 
 The chargesheet stated that Kamat, who also held the mines portfolio, condoned the delay by overruling observations of two IAS officers. The state government has no power to condone such delay, the chargesheet states.
 
 Superintendent of Police (crime branch) Karthik Kashyap said that taking advantage of the condonation, the Kadnekar family entered into an agreement with Magnum Minerals, thereby transferring the rights of lease without approval of the state and central governments. 
 
 They then allowed them to mine iron ore with Kamatâ€™s blessings.
