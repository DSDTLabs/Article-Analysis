Not everyone knows that there are two   celebrations one can be a part of. And still, the recent Durga pujo celebration at Kali Bari, saw hundreds of visitors on all three days. IT professional Namrata Dubey said, “Since my childhood I only knew that Navaratri happened once in a year, during winter. But 10 years ago, my dad took me to   in Khadki and that’s when I got to know that Bengalis celebrate two pujos and the one during spring (basanti) is not that popular. Nevertheless, the fun, food and celebrations remain the same for me even today.”

 
  
  As we toured the Kali Bari pandal in Khadki, devotees of Maa Durga were seen offering   (fasting and offering flowers to the goddess). A special attraction, Annapurna puja (puja offered to the Goddess of nourishment) was organised on ashtami (the eighth day) which was exclusively for ladies. The evenings were packed with cultural programmes where participants of all age groups took part in a dance show and a Pune-based cultural group, Upasana, performed on saptami. While the cultural programmes are one aspect of pujo, bhog is another aspect that’s very close to a Bengali’s heart. Special bhog arrangements were done on ashtami/navami where devotees could feast on khichudi, chaatni and payesh.
