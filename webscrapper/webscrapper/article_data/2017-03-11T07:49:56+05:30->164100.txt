Ahmedabad: With   coinciding with the CBSE and state  , there have been fewer-than-usual bookings for long weekend getaways and holidays. While most people are heading to nearby destinations for a day or two, overall bookings have been low-key.

 “Bookings are almost half because of the ongoing board exams and other exams at several schools. Moreover, the effect of demonetization appears to be there, as people are not spending on luxury. While a few travellers are headed out over the holidays, long-haul destinations which are usually preferred over long weekends are less popular this time,” said Anuj Pathak, a city-based tour operator.
 
 With most travellers preferring short-haul destinations, road trips to Rajasthan and Saurashtra have been a hit. “Most people are headed to Mount Abu, Udaipur, Diu and Sasan Gir over the long weekend. Rajasthan is usually a popular destination during Holi, owing to the popularity of the festival there and a number of hotels are booked full,” said Manoj Shah, president, Travel Agents and Tour Operators Association of Gujarat.
 
 Most travellers happen to be youngsters, groups of friends and DINK couples, who want to get away from their routine hustle and bustle for a quiet getaway. “As the Dhuleti holiday is right after the weekend, a group of six friends and I decided to venture out for a short getaway. We’ll be travelling to Diu and Sasan Gir,” said Mukesh Ghia, a city-based businessman.
 
 “The last two weeks have been really busy for me and my husband at work and we intend to relax and enjoy over the weekend. We’ll be headed to Udaipur and will spend some quiet time unwinding,” said Kriti Jain, a city-based professional.
