AHMEDABAD: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) court hearing the   decided on Wednesday to summon   Amit Shah and 13 others for examination as witnesses in this 2002   

 Special judge P B Desai ordered that witness summons be issued to Shah and others in response to an application by former minister and an accused in this case, Maya Kodnani. She had argued in her defence that she was not at the spot in Naroda when the violence took place.
 
 Kodnani, VHP official Jaideep Patel and Bajrang Dal functionary Babu Bajrangi are the key accused in this case. More than 80 accused people are being tried for the killing of 11 people in   on February 28, 2002.
 
 Kodnani's advocate, Amit Patel, had sought that Shah and others be summoned as witnesses. He argued that this was necessary to establish Kodnani's claim that when the violence occurred, she was at the assembly in Gandhinagar and later at Sola Civil Hospital on SG Road.
 
 Patel had cited three prosecution witnesses who had made statements contradicting the prosecution's claim that Kodnani was at Naroda Gam.
 
 She further urged the court to permit her to examine Shah and 13 others so that she could establish her presence at the state assembly, then at the Sola Civil Hospital and later at the Civil Hospital in Asarwa, and finally at her own hospital - Shivam Maternity Home at Saijpur Bogha.
 
 Apart from Shah, those who Kodnani wants questioned include her husband Surendra Kodnani, Dr Dhaval Shah and one of the patients treated by her at her hospital on February 28, 2002.
