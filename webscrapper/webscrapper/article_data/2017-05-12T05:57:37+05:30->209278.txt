PUNE:Police have arrested three   travelling in an SUV for allegedly making   and abusing two   and a male officer at   near the race course on  

 The incident occurred around 5.50pm on Wednesday when the men were asked to stop during a drive against vehicles with tinted glass. 
 
 The three men, residents of Ashoknagar in Nigdi-Pradhikaran, ignored the police’s signal to stop and kept driving towards Golibar Maidan. 
 
 While passing by the traffic constables, the driver lowered his window screen, hurled abuses and made an obscene gesture at the women constables. The constables used their walkie-talkie sets to alert the beat marshals and traffic constables manning the square ahead. Police intercepted the SUV near Golibar Maidan.
 
 On seeing the police approaching them, the youths hurriedly broke a few beer bottles inside the SUV. The smell of alcohol was too overbearing for the police to miss, when they asked the men to get down from the SUV. They conducted a test on the trio with a breath analyser and found them drunk. The trio then created a scene by sprawling in front of a PMPML bus in a desperate bid to avoid police action. 
 
 One of the women traffic constables later filed a case with the Wanowrie police against the three —Siraj Rustam Ansari (24), Raju Gaikwad (23) and Kiran Gawali (25). All three were arrested. 
 
 “We have charged them with offences punishable under sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 504 (insult with the intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the Indian Penal Code,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ashok Morale told TOI. 
 
 The three were also booked for relevant offences under the Motor Vehicle Act for drunk driving, he added.
