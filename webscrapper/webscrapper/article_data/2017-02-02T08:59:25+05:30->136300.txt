CHANDIGARH: Around 40 Dalit families, who fled Mirchpur village in fear following an attack on a group belonging to their community by upper caste men, returned on Wednesday after an assurance by the administration regarding their security.

 Haryana minister for welfare of scheduled castes and backward classes Krishan Bedi managed to pursuade them to return to the village. About 40 families had left the village following the violence on Monday night.
 
 Nine Dalits were injured when allegedly attacked by around 20 upper caste men following an argument during a cycle event. The Dalits who reached Hisar on Tuesday were sent back the same night in Haryana Roadway buses, a police spokesperson said on Wednesday.
 
 A deputy superintendent of police (DSP), an inspector and 60 policemen have been deployed in Mirchpur as a precautionary measure. “The situation in the village is under control and extra police force has been deployed to avoid any untoward incident,” said Hisar superintendent of police (SP) Rajender Singh Meena.
 
 Four persons were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the alleged attack on Dalits. The villagers were watching a cycle show when some persons on the spot allegedly passed a casteist remark on a Dalit youth who had won the race, police said.
 
 The Dalits then objected to the comment following which a group of 20 people from another community allegedly attacked them, they said.
 
 Meanwhile, Ishwar Singh, member of   ( ), visited Mirchpur on Wednesday and interacted with the victims. He assured them that the commission would protect their interest.
 
 “A three-member committee under the chairmanship of deputy commissioner has been formed, which will submit a detailed report to the commission within 10 days,” he said.
 
 Hisar deputy commissioner Nikhil Gajraj informed the NCSC member that Rs 25,000 each had been given to the nine injured.
 
 Nearly six years ago, two people were burnt alive in an inter-caste violence in the same village.
