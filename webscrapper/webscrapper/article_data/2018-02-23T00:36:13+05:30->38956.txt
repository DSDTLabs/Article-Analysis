Tirunelveli: Amidst resistance from protesters, corporation authorities removed more than 130 encroachments as part of an eviction drive conducted at three places in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai on Thursday. This is the third eviction drive carried out by the corporation in less than three months. Officials said the drives were conducted following complaints from the public that the encroachments were obstructing movement of vehicles and pedestrians. Most of the illegal structures removed on Thursday were temporary and permanent structures in front of shops, which were not removed despite warning from the civic body. Backed by the police, more than 50 corporation officials and staff were engaged in the eviction drive. A group of traders objected to the drive when structures protruding on the road and materials in the shops were displayed on the pavement and the road at Gandhi Market in Palayamkottai. As many as 92 illegal structures were removed from the road in Gandhi Market. In a similar drive, 38 encroaching structures were removed at Bose Market in Tirunelveli. A team also cleared stoves and snacks kept on the pavements in the bus stand. Corporation officials said that such surprise drives will be conducted without prior notice on a monthly basis.
