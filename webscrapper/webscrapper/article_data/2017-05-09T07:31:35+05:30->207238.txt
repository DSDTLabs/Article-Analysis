LUDHIANA: Ludhiana cops of the rank of head constable and constable wanted to up their cool quotient by togging in their stylish narrow bottom, tight, low-waist pants and skin-fitted shirts. But the cool dudes showing biceps got a slap on the wrist from a top cop. 

 Of the 480 cops checked, more than 430 were found to be cut from the same cloth, for they had disregarded the uniform rules. Police deputy commissioner Dhruman   served notices on them. Only 17 were issued appreciation certificates for wearing the correct uniform.
 
 The number of head constables and constables   have is approximately 1,800. Many of them these days can be seen wearing trendy uniform, showing biceps. 
 
  Nimbale had instructed all SHOs and line officers to inform and ensure that cops followed the dress code. They were given 15 days to get their dresses altered and the senior officials were to ensure compliance of the order.
 
 DCP Nimbale said, "So far, I have checked 480 cops and majority of them were found not complying with the dress code. More than 430 have been issued notices."
 
 It was mainly the men who were found flouting the rules. About the trends the cops were following, the DCP said, "Women cops are seen wearing tight-fitted shirts and short sleeves. Men like to wear low waist, narrow bottom and extremely tight pants. 
 
 During checking, when some cops were asked to squat, they could not as their pants were skin-tight."
 
 The policemen have reasons galore for throwing the rules out of the window. A cop, requesting anonymity, said that fitted uniforms looked stylish and the prescribed uniforms were loose and did not look nice. Another cop said, "Even in movies, policemen are seen wearing fitted uniform, which looks good."
 
 However, some cops told senior officials that at   tailors stitched uniforms according to their wishes. 
 
 Following this, the DCP held a meeting with all the four tailors who stitch police uniforms and issued directions on correct style.
