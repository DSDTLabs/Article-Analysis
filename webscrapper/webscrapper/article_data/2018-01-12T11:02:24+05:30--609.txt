DHARAMSHALA: Facing a tough time during the   regime, the   (HPCA) on Thursday expressed gratitude to the new state government for ordering withdraw of ‘all cases filed under political vendetta’ against the cricket body.

 Sources say it has come as a huge relief for the elder son of former   CM P K Dhumal, MP Anurag Thakur and other office bearers of the association.
 
 Sanjay Sharma, spokesperson of the association said the Congress had prepared a 53-point charge sheet but it acted on only 18 of those related to the HPCA, P K Dhumal and his close aides.
 
 “The Congress had registered 5 cases against this cricket body. These were related to encroachment and land lease. The first FIR was registered in August 2013, alleging cheating, fraud and misappropriation of funds,” said Sanjay.
 
 He alleged that his family members, including his children, were also targeted in cases related to the HPCA. “Vigilance officials interrogated my children in their school. It was an embarrassing for me,” he added.
 
 He said apart from Anurag Thakur, office bearers of the association, even former chief minister Dhumal was also named in a case filed by the vigilance in August 2013. In October 2013, the state cabinet also took a decision to cancel the land lease to the stadium and ordered to take over the property of the stadium.
 
 “It was murder of democracy when it took over the properties of the HPCA in midnight, immediately after their cabinet meeting on October 29, 2013. It was around 11.30pm when this action was taken,” he alleged.
