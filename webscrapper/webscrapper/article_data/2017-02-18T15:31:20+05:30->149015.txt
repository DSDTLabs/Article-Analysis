NEW DELHI: EK   won a floor test to remain Tamil Nadu chief minister when lawmakers today voted in his favour after hours of disgraceful behaviour in the Assembly.

  The   acolyte needed the votes of at least 117 MLAs to win the trust vote. As many as 122 MLAs voted in his favour. 
 
  Palaniswamiâ€™s win means the waning of the political star of caretaker chief minister  , who also belongs to the AIADMK.
 
  The vote was concluded after hours of disgraceful chaos in the state Assembly after speaker P Dhanapal turned down the opposition's request for a secret ballot. Chairs and mics were hurled and broken and Dhanapal was manhandled. The House was adjourned twice and resumed after the second adjournment at 3pm.
