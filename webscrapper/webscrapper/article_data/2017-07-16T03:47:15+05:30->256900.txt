AHMEDABAD: A 2002 riots convict has got bail from the   high court to conduct interviews of suitable boys shortlisted as potential matches for his daughterâ€™s engagement.

 Minesh  , a convict in the Ode massacre of Malav Bhagol, where three persons were killed, was sentenced to life imprisonment along with others by a special court in 2012. The court had found him guilty of murder, conspiracy, rioting and arson.
 
 Patel first sought bail last month on the ground that he had to arrange the admission of his son in a diploma course. The HC ordered his release for 15 days. On Friday, Patel urged the court to extend his bail period for 30 more days to meet potential matches for his daughter.
 
 A bench of Justice   and Justice A J Shastri granted seven more days to Patel after taking into consideration his good conduct in jail. Of the eight others sentenced to life in the case, six jumped bail in 2008 and went abroad. Of these, five were brought back.
