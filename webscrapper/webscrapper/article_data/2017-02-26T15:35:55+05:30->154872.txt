MANGALURU: Mangaluru City Police will initiate action on complaints against anyone who ventured to forcibly   and establishments in a bid to   call against Kerala CM's visit to city on Saturday. Even though organisers of the strike had said that the protest will be voluntary, instances of forcible closure of shops during the day has been reported. However, none of the affected persons have lodged any complaint with the jurisdictional police so far, police authorities said.

 Incidentally, the issue came to the fore at the monthly SC/ST meeting organised by city police where a community leader complained that notwithstanding strict police vigil, miscreants forcibly closed down shops. K M Shantharaju, deputy commissioner of police (law and order) who chaired the meeting, said police would initiate action against anyone against whom they receive a complaint to this effect or are able to find direct evidence of people have being coerced to do so.
 
 The leaders said people are wary of lodging a police complaint in such cases lest it antagonizes people and other influential people with whom they interact on a daily basis. M Sanjeev Patil, deputy commissioner of police (crime and traffic), said as a matter of rule, people may always call the city police control room on 100 in such cases or other instances where local or other miscreants try to browbeat the locals and the personnel from jurisdictional police will initiate action.
 
 City police chief M Chandra Sekhar backing the stand taken by his officers at the meeting told TOI that police had detained 68 potential trouble makers under Section 61 of the K P Act around 4am on Saturday and released them around 7pm. However, despite this, if few miscreants have managed to enforce their writ illegally on hapless persons, the city police will not hesitate to act against such them and urged the affected to approach the jurisdictional police.
