BHOPAL: Aiming at a world record by planting six crore saplings on July 2 on the banks of river Narmada,   chief minister   hads urged people to register themselves and be a witness to the grand event which has already caught the imagination of world with its biggest river and environment conservation programme.

 The chief minister also launched a website and registered himself and his wife as first volunteer couple to plant saplings on www.namamidevinarmade.mp.gov.in to participate in mass   drive on July 2. Chouhan said the site would enrol, inform and encourage people to take initiatives to save our rivers and the environment through afforestation.
 
 “As Narmada Sewa Yatra has drawn the attention of public towards environment conservation, the plantation drive on July 2 will help in involvingpeople in the ambitious campaign to save the earth for the future generation. After the campaign, the river conservation programme will be implemented all over the state and afforestation drive will be launched annually,” said Chouhan while inaugurating the website at his official residence on Wednesday.
 
 The chief minister said that this would be world's biggest afforestation drive as saplings will be planted across five km stretch of the river bank and in the catchment areas of Narmada. Saplings will be planted on forest and revenue land, while fruit saplings will be planted in privately owned land.
 
 “Apart from planting saplings, government would make serious efforts for safety and maintenance of saplings. We have also invited people to volunteer as ‘caretaker’ to guard and nurture the saplings”, said the chief minister.
 
 As per the plan, about six crore saplings will be made available to the public through government and non-government nurseries. Digging of pits will begin in June and if required, fencing will be done to protect the plants from animals.
