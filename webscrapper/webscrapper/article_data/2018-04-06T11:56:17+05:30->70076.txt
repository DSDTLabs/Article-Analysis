CHANDIGARH: An   clip of a BJP   from ward number 12, Chandrawati Shukla and circle auditor  , Raghu went viral on Thursday. In the audio clip, the councillor who had gone to meet R D  , principal of Government Smart School, Sector 53, Chandigarh seeking admission of a student of her area, could be heard asking the Circle auditor (private schools), Raghu to help her in getting the admission.

 In the alleged audio clip, Raghu is heard saying that he needed to talk to the principal and later while talking to the principal it could be heard that both the principal and the circle auditor called the councillor uncouth who is troubling them just to get votes.
 
 "Yes I have come to know about the audio clip but I have not received any kind of written complaint from the area councillor or from the parents. I have even not heard the audio. Once a written complaint is received I will initiate an investigation into the matter," said Director School Education, UT,  
 
 â€œI am not into any kind conflict with the councillor, whereas Shukla had a brawl with the school principal and abused him in the school only. If somebody uses a foul language against the education department officials then it is obvious that the person will not get a good treatment," Circle auditor (private schools)   Department, Raghu.
