GANDHINAGAR: In a written response to dogged demands by the opposition for tabling the action-taken-report (ATR) on   in the Assembly, chief minister   said, “There is no need to table the report in the house.” The   was formed in 2011 by the state government to probe almost one lakh alleged corruption cases. 

 Even though the final report was submitted in 2017, the report is not available to the public though the state government perfunctorily tabled it in the assembly on March 31, 2017, the last day of the budget session that year.
 
 Congress MLAs said the ATR should have been submitted in the state assembly within three months of the commission report, and asked the government when it intended to publish it.
 
 MB Shah Commission is known to have given a clean chit to the then   led Gujarat government in 9 out of 17 issues just before the assembly elections in 2012. It took another five years to submit the final report.
 
 On the CM’s assertion that the report need not be placed in the assembly, Paresh Dhanani, leader of opposition (LOP) said,“Tabling of the ATR in the house on any inquiry commission is a standard practice. However, the CM in writing has refused to table the ATR report, and this indicates BJP is trying to hide the corruption.”’
