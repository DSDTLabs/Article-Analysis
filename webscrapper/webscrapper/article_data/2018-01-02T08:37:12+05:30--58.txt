BENGALURU: A civil rights group has lodged a complaint with the   (ACB) alleging the Siddaramaiah-led government is wasting taxpayers' money on advertisements to glorify its achievements and asserted that the   party should bear the cost of such publicity. 

  Claiming that the government has spent more than Rs 129.46 crore on such advertisements in its four-and-a-half-year tenure, the Bengaluru Nagarika Hakku   has demanded action against chief minister   for such "massive corruption." The ACB, however, is yet to file a case in this regard and has just acknowledged the complaint, sources confirmed to TOI. 
 
 The complaint also alleges that the government has illegally advertised at 489 bus stands belonging to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( ). 
 
  "The government has been displaying its advertisements without the required permission and the BBMP joint commissioner (advertisements) has issued two notices in this regard. In these, the BBMP has demanded that the government pay Rs 13 crore as advertisement tax," the complaint reads. 
 
  Reiterating that action must be taken against such blatant misuse of public funds, Ganesh Singh B, the vice-president of the samithi, urged ACB to also book a case against the principal secretary and other officials of the information department.
