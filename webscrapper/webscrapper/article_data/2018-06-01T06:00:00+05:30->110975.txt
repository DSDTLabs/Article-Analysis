A self-confessed foodie,   turned a ‘bringer of biryani’ for her co-stars  ,   and the entire crew of her upcoming romcom in Mumbai.

 “I’ve been shooting in Mumbai for the second schedule of the film and knowing that I now live in Hyderabad, everybody on the sets has been asking me when I will get some biryani from here. Every time I travelled to and fro between Mumbai and Hyderabad, I either got early morning or late night flights. I didn’t want to carry stale biryani so, recently when my brother Aman came to meet me in Mumbai, I made sure he flies from Hyderabad at the time of the day when they prepare fresh biryani,” says Rakul. And guess what, it wasn’t just biryani she treated the crew to. “Along with 5 kg of mutton biryani, Aman also got some kebabs and Qubani ka meetha. So it was a feast for the entire cast and crew,” she says.
 
 What added to the feast was when Tabu, a true blue Hyderabadi, too decided to get some homemade mutton pulao. “I had told Tabu ma’am that I’m going to get   biryani on the sets and if she would like to have some. She said, ‘Even my mom made mutton pulao today, I’ll get you that.’ It added to the feast you know,” says Rakul, who’s wrapped the second schedule of the Ajay Devgn film and will be flying back to Hyderabad today for the shoot of   17. 
 
 It’s been a while since Rakul has been living out of suitcase, shooting back-to-back. “I was shooting outside Hyderabad this entire year, so the moment I got to know I’ve to be in the city for Karthi 17’s shoot, I just jumped with joy. I’m so happy I’ll be at my house in Hyderabad today, sleep on my bed, make my food, meet my friends and hangout with them. I’ll also be gorging on some   delicacies when I get a chance,” she signs off.
