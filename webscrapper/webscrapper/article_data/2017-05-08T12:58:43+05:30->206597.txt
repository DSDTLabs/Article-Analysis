HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here has directed a private body care center to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation to a customer for botching up the  . 

 Attracted by their advertisements,   approached La Bella Body Care Private Limited, Gachibowli and opted for a weight loss package which costs Rs 33, 708 and requires her to undergo twenty sessions of non-surgical body sculpting and certain oral medication over the period of six months.
 
 During the course of the treatment,   submitted that she was made to undergo vibrating cum heating session wherein the' unqualified' staff caused her skin to inflame causing severe burns and high fever.
 
 "I informed about the side effects to the concerned person at the center and she admitted that her staff had failed to place a cotton swab in between the skin and the belt, as a result of which, severe damage was caused to my skin. I was unable to attend to work for five days due to the inconvenience caused and inflammation that erupted," Evanjalin submitted before the forum and added that she had asked the center to refund her money as she lost trust, but they failed to do so even after repe- ated requests. 
 
 The center, in its written version, denied that complainant developed any burn scars as it is the practice followed by them at the end of every session to check for burns if any, and take a report of the same. "The complainant has fabricated the facts for the purpose of filing the present complaint as she did not report about burns on the said day," the center alleged.
