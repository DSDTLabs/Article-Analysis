 Unsure of the object, the police team informed the bomb detective and disposal squad (BDDS) officials who arrived and seized the flare.Police also alerted Army officials about the seizure and a team is expected to examine the object on Sunday .
 
 A senior police officer said it came as a surprise to everyone in the locality after the strange object was noticed. Police are questioning people in the neigh bourhood to check if they had noticed the flare floating in the sky earlier.
 
 An army official said the flare, sometimes called a fusee, is a type of pyrotechnic device that produces a brilliant light or intense heat without an explosion.
 
 Flares are used for signalling, providing illumination or for defensive countermeasures in civilian and military applications, he said.
