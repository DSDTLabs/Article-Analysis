PATNA: Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Saturday inspected the   bus depot near Gandhi Maidan in Patna.

 The officer noticed the absence of CCTV cameras at the depot where ticket counters also lacked proper signs. Male and female toilets were not only unclean but also lacked basic plumbing facilities. There was neither a canteen nor any food counter for passengers. 
 
 This newspaper had published a report on March 12, highlighting the poor state of depot. Many fans in the only government bus depot in the city were non-functional. Three old buses, that were to be auctioned, were instead serving as a partition between the waiting area and the workshop of the depot.
 
 Agarwal said the depot would be renovated. He asked officials to put up proper signs at ticket counters as well as toilets and install tiles in the toilets. 
 
 He also directed the officials to send the three old buses to the central workshop at Phulwarisharif. “CCTV cameras will be installed and a canteen will be opened soon at the depot,” Agarwal said.
