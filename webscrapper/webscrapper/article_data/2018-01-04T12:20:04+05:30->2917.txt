BAREILLY: As the advertisements written on walls and   pasted on the walls “affect the beauty” of   district, the district administration from Wednesday has started a crackdown on such advertisements. Teams of police and administration have started whitewashing walls, which have advertisements written or pasted on them. They are also serving notices to advertisers concerned in this connection.
 
  Badaun district magistrate Dinesh   told TOI, “I had recently conducted meeting with heads of all civic bodies in the district and learnt that no nagar palika or panchayat has given contract to anybody for using walls for advertisement purpose. Scores of people have been doing so without any permission. As wall writings and posters affect the beauty of the district, we have decided to stop them.”
  
  According to district administration, nobody has the right to use walls of their residence or public property for advertisements in the form of posters or slogans. “Only shopkeepers will be allowed to put up advertisements on their shops while they will not be permitted to use the walls of their shop for advertising anybody else,” said Kumar.
  
  On Wednesday, after spotting any writing or posters on the walls, teams of police and administration removed them and did whitewashing of the walls. The expenses incurred on removal will also be taken from the advertiser concerned.
  
  In the second phase, the officials of district administration have planned to ask their men to do painting on the whitewashed walls. “Instead of advertisements, we have planned to use the walls to showcase painting on importance of education, cleanliness and other campaigns of the government, including beti bachao, to create awareness among masses,” said Kumar.
