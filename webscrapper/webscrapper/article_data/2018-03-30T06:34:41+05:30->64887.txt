HYDERABAD: Not one but all four gear wheels (main back wheels) of an   aircraft from   burst on landing at the   airport on Wednesday night. The runway was closed for four hours following the accident and flight delays cascaded into the next day.

 A spokesperson for   confirmed the multiple tyre bursts. “Since all four main gear wheels burst on landing, the aircraft was rendered completely immobile.   team supported by Hyderabad airport officials changed two of the four tyres as per disabled aircraft recovery plan, post which the aircraft was safely towed away and operations resumed at 0222 hours on March 29,” the spokesperson said.
 
  
  
 
 “It could have been a major tragedy considering all the main landing wheels, both on the port (left side) and starboard (right side), burst. The aircraft fell right on its belly. At that speed, passengers could have been seriously injured. This is a very unusual occurrence,” said a private airline staffer familiar with the incident.
 
 Soon after the accident, RGIA shut down the runway. “It took longer to resume operations as Indigo’s towing equipment wasn’t working efficiently. Alternative arrangements had to be made by the airport staff to remove the aircraft from the runway and clear it for subsequent arrivals and departures,” another source said.
 
 Indigo, however, denied the claims and maintained that only one tyre of the aircraft had burst. “The matter has been reported to the  ,” said an airline spokesperson.
 
 Aviation experts said the accident pointed to poor maintenance by Indigo’s engineering team, which put at risk the lives of 77 people. “The engineers must be more vigilant. Tyre bursts usually happen because of shoddy maintenance — physical damage or problem with brakes. It could also be due to excessive friction and high temperature,” said M Sehgal, a citybased pilot.
