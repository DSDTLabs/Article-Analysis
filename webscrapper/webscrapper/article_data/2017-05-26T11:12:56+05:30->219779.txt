KOCHI: Two Kerala athletes   and   had a harrowing time at the   on Thursday evening as they were forcefully deplaned by officials of national carrier, Air India, for carrying the pole that   uses for the pole vault event.

 The two were on their way back to Kochi from Delhi by 6 pm Air India flight after participating in the Asian Youth Athletics Meet in Bangkok, where   had won gold in boys' 800m while Nivya had finished sixth in girls' pole vault.
 
 "After boarding the plane, Abhishek and I were asked to deplane by the stewards. We didn't know the reason. Later on, we learnt that the pole that I was carrying in the baggage was the reason for our detention. Neither the airport officials or the Air India officials gave us any reason," Nivya told TOI from Delhi airport.
 
 "My personal coach   and other senior athletes, who are in Kerala, called and tried to convince the officials here they refused to even take their calls," added Nivya who is also the national record holder in the youth girls pole vault (3.32m) event.
 
 Nivya said that two hours after missing their flight, the airline officials relented and finally agreed to let them go by Air India flight (5.45 am) to Kochi on Friday. "We have been forced to stay back at the airport till early morning. I don't know whether somebody will arrange for our food or we will have to pay from our own pockets," she said.
 
 Nivya didn't face any problem when she took the pole, measuring 4.15 metres and costing around one lakh, to Delhi from Kochi for the national camp earlier this month.
