More   were killed in fire-related accidents in 2015, compared to men, in Mumbai as well as Maharashtra. Latest National Crime Records Bureau ( ) data shows Maharashtra had the most fatalities due to fires compared to other states in 2015. 

 “When we speak of women sustaining injuries or being killed in fire-related accidents, we need to understand the circumstances and origin of blaze. Women spend more time in the kitchen, compared to men. They would, therefore, be more prone to kitchen-related fires, such as gas leakage, hot water spill or stove burst,” said former chief fire officer P D Kargupikar. He pointed out that many women are also victims of domestic violence which could be caused by fire. “Instances of bride-burning for dowry or a married woman being branded over a dispute would result in a greater number of female victims,” he added. 
 
 Among the 3,377 fire-related casualties in Maharashtra that year, 70% were women. Most female casualties were aged 18-30. Among men in Maharashtra, most casualties were aged 30-45. Madhya Pradesh ranked second and Gujarat came third in fatalities in 2015. In both these states, more women were killed in fire-related accidents. 
 
 Among cities, Mumbai had the second most fire-related fatalities in 2015. Again 70% of the 223 deaths were of women. Nitasha Natu
