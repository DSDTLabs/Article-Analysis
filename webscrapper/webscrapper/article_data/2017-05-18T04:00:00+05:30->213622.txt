These plants package 9, 72,000 litre of water daily and supply it to different parts of the city. “We take samples regularly and punish those who sell contaminated water,” said an SMC officer. 
 
 “SMC should ensure that the Jitu Patel never gets the licence to sell packaged mineral water again. Many water bottling plants package bore water and sell it as mineral water to people,” said Shiv Patel, a resident of Limbayat .
 
 SMC chief health officer Dr Ashish Naik said, “The issue of impure water crops up in areas like Limbayat, Udhna and Varachha zone more often. People living in Rander and   have installed reverse osmosis (RO) plants in their homes.”
