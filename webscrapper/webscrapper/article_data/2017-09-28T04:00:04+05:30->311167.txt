Mumbai: A special   court has   a   Protection Force ( ) assistant sub-inspector who was arrested on charges of demanding a bribe of Rs 2,000 from an illegal fruit-seller at Andheri railway station in 2013. The complainant admitted before court that he and other vendors were annoyed with the cops and decided to take action against them. “These admissions reveal that the complainant had a grudge with police and as such his evidence is to be appreciated with utmost care,” the court said.

 In 2013, the officer was posted at the railway station and the complainant was selling fruits on platform six. On January 18, 2013, he lodged a complaint with the CBI ACB alleging that the accused had demanded a bribe, and if paid he would be allowed to continue business for two months.
 
 The prosecution alleged that on January 19, 2013, the CBI team and complainant went to a spot near the station. In the trap operation, the complainant is alleged to have first recorded a conversation with the accused where a bribe was demanded and later he is alleged to have handed over the amount to the accused. The Rs 500 notes handed over to the accused were tainted with a powder by the investigating team, who stood vigil a few feet away. After the money was handed over to the accused, the complainant gave a pre-decided signal to the CBI team, which nabbed the accused.
 
 The court pointed out that in his cross-examination before court the complainant admitted that on January 19, 2013, when he met the accused, the latter only told him to bring tea, and after he brought it, he was told to leave. He admitted that the accused was busy and there was no other conversation between them. The court said the tape-recordings were corroborative evidence. “When substantive evidence of the complainant regarding the demand of bribe by the accused is disbelieved, the alleged tape-recorded conversations are not helpful for the prosecution,” the court said.
