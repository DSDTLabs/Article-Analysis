BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s advice to his cabinet colleagues to engage themselves with the public seems to be working, at least in tourism minister Surendra Patwa’s constituency Bhojpur, where the minister was seen playing Kabaddi with local people on Wednesday.

 Patwa had gone to participate in ‘Nagar Uday Abhiyan’ in Raisen district where the government had announced welfare schemes for beneficiaries. Patwa distributed LPG connections to people belonging to below poverty line (BPL) under the Ujjawala scheme in Mandideep and Obedullaganj industrial areas, which fall under his assembly constituency Bhojpur.
 
 The area is also represented by Congress stalwart   and people had often seen the leaders keeping a distance from locals in order to maintain their influence. Leaders participating in local sports with the public is a rare scene here.
 
 As part of happiness department initiatives, the minister inaugurated Vidhayak Trophy for Kabaddi competition in Obedullaganj and played a friendly match with local players. “This is a good initiative indeed to get in touch and mingle with local residents in their style,” reacted the minister after the match.
 
 Local BJP leaders were also happy to witness a show of strength between two political leaders of their area. They not only enjoyed the match but also developed a local bonding with their representatives. It was chief minister Chouhan who had asked his ministerial colleagues and bureaucrats to visit towns and villages to mingle with people and the latest incident could be a good news for him.
 
 Earlier, similar matches had been organised by state power minister Paras Jain in Ujjain where not only local talent but the minister himself took part in sport events like Kabaddi and wrestling.
