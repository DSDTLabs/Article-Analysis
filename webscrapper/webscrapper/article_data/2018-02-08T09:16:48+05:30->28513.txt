HYDERABAD: The   leaders charged Prime Minister   for insulting the people of Telangana during his speech in the Parliament on Wednesday.

 Reacting sharply to the PM’s reply in the Parliament,   described Modi’s speech as sub-standard even than the talk of a common men’s discussion under a tree. “By insulting the Telangana Statehood Bill,   has insulted the people of this state. Modi has also insulted the Constitution by insulting the Telangana Statehood Bill (State Reorganisation Act),” Revanth said.
 
 “The UPA solved bifurcation blues of three states formed by the   earlier. Now, the Centre has failed to solve the bifurcation issues of Telangana and AP,” Revanth added.
