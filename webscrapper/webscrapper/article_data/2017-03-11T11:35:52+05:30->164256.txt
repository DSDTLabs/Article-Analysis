LUCKNOW: Holi has come early for the   supporters in Uttar Pradesh with the party set to script a record win in the state.
 
 Overjoyed party workers hugged each other, broke into brief jigs and raised victory slogans in the BJP office in Lucknow as trends indicated a saffron surge.
  
 As per the trends so far, the BJP is close to the 300-mark in the state, while the SP-Congress combine has been restricted to a little over 70 seats. The BSP appears to be heading for a distant third position.
  
 BJP workers raised slogans like "Chappa Chappa Bhajpa", "Kahan pade ho chakkar mein, koi nahin hai takkar mein" and "Modi Modi".
  
 The victory is set to end the BJP's 14-year exile in the state which the party said has been "ruined" by the BSP and the SP in the last decade.
  
 In contrast, there was no activity at the ruling Samajwadi Party's office at Vikramaditya Marg, which is located just next to the house of former party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, with counting trends indicating a drubbing. The sprawling BSP office near the Annexe, the power centre of Uttar Pradesh government, also wore a deserted look.
  
 Congress office at Mall Avenue, which saw limelight return to it after the party entered into alliance with the ruling SP, also was deserted with almost negligible visitors.
