BHOPAL: BJP leader   dragged political slugfest to a new low in   on Monday by threatening to break Congress MP  's hands and chop off his tongue "if he dares raise a finger at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan". 

 Dhakad, the national head of Kirar-Dhakad Samaj, gave the threat on Sunday night at a public meet in Scindia's stronghold of Kolaras - where assembly bypolls are likely to be held along with Mungaoli.
 
 "Scindia alone is challenging the chief minister. In other words, he is challenging us, the  . I want to make it clear that if he raises a finger on the chief minister, we will break his hands. If he makes absurd allegations, we will cut his tongue. It is a matter of pride for our community and we will not spare anyone who tries to deride us. We are Dhakads," the BJP leader said. The CM's son, Kartikeya, who is cutting his teeth in politics, was present at the rally.
 
 Congress condemned BJP for "promoting Dhakad-like elements", and local leaders in Shivpuri warned that they would respond strongly to such statements. "It is shocking and shows BJP's criminal culture. Dhakad's open threat to Scindia, from a public platform, exposes BJP's tradition. Will BJP register a criminal case against Dhakad for this abusiveness?" tweeted MP Congress president Arun Yadav.
