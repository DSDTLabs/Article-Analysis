Panaji: While close to 200 AAP   from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat are helping the party ready itself for the February 4 polls, around 100 NRI volunteers from the US, Canada and Australia have already begun arriving into Goa and working for the party. 

 Most domestic volunteers have been frequenting the state over the past two months, helping in various back-end jobs including administration work while others are involved in distributing pamphlets during the party’s door-to-door campaigning, the party’s political committee and national executive member Ashutosh told TOI.
 
 Brad Mishra, an IT professional living in Australia for the past 23 years, has come down to Goa over a month ago and has been working for the party ever since.
 
 Tarak Goradia an IITian who worked in the US but has now settled in Bengaluru has been associated with the party since January 2014. He has been making frequent trips to the state since May last year helping the party in fund raising and content writing. “Many supporters wanting to donate want to look at candidate’s profiles. Some candidates have notable achievements, so I try and capture their strong points and project them when I write their profiles,” Goradia told TOI, adding that his flexible timings as an IT consultant help him devote time to the party. “I want the party to make an impact,” he said. 
 
 AAP’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will make his sixth trip to Goa on Saturday. He will address public rallies over three days in Shiroda, Curchorem, Sanguem, Mandrem, Cortalim, Zuarinagar, Margao, Aldona and St Cruz.
