 Talking about her game, Avshreya, who is also a lawyer, told us, “I play exhibition matches every Sunday at the Jaipur Polo Grounds, and I want to play international matches too. At home, we all are interested in different sports – mom (Neelam Pratap Rudy) plays golf, dad ( ) plays badminton, and my sister (Atisha) plays football. So we have a lot of discussions around sports at home.”
