NEW DELHI: Punjab National Bank ( ),

 The state-run bank also plans to leverage data for loan recovery and risk management through a tie-up with an external agency.
 
 PNB is seeking to access contact details of defaulters, who have good credit record with other lenders and chase the errant borrowers. “This partnership is a part of the larger strategy to deploy technology to strengthen internal systems. This partnership will not only help the bank with loan recovery but will also help identify and automate profitable lending strategies and minimize credit and fraud risk,” the statement said.
 
 It claimed that two special one-time settlement ( ) schemes have already helped accelerate recovery of bad debt, with the average rising from 70,000-80,000   accounts a year to 2.25 lakh accounts during the last 10 months. These schemes apply to small NPA accounts, helping defaulters come out of debt.
