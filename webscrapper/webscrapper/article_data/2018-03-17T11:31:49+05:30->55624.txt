Being touted as one of the most promising stars on TV,   aka Soi of   talks about her journey so far

 
  Soi, Nayantara and now, Uma
 
  Studied in Don Bosco School, Silchar, Debattama 
 graduated in English honours from Amity University
 
  I was into singing and dancing and never ever thought that I’ll become an actress. My mother told me that I should try my luck at an audition where they were looking for a fresh face for a new serial. I didn’t want to go, but still I went for it with a friend just for fun. The next day, I got a call informing me that I had been selected and was asked to come for a look test. I was literally zapped! But now, I love what I do. Acting has become a part of my life now
 
  I feel like a celebrity when I go to my birthplace, Assam, now. They organise events for me and what not! People ask me how the track will progress and about my character and I feel so happy that they regularly watch my serial. Even in Kolkata, people request selfies with 
 me, which feels great!
