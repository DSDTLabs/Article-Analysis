BATHINDA: The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the appointment of SAD-turned-Congress leader Charanjit Singh   as president of Rampura Phul municipal council. The court also stayed further proceedings with respect to appointment of a new president of the municipal council till October 30 and issued a notice to the Punjab government.

 Though outgoing   president Sunil Kumar   had submitted an affidavit about the court granting stay on the election of the civic body chief, the authorities had gone ahead with the election and had demanded a copy of the order. The copy was made available on Saturday.
 
 Jatana was elected as president by 15 councillors and Rampura Phul MLA Gurpreet Singh Kangar of the Congress on Friday. Before his election, Jatana was with SAD and had joined the Congress after getting elected as the Rampura Phul MC president. Apart from him,   was also elected as vice-president. However, the stay order is only for the post of the president. 
 
 Bitta, who had approached the court against election for the post of president, said that, “I had called the meeting to face the no-confidence motion filed against me for November 21. However, the councillors and the authorities went ahead and held the election meeting on September 22. The court has stayed the election held on Friday and issued a notice for October 30.”
 
 Bathinda deputy commissioner   said that, “After getting the stay order from court, no notification about the election will be issued about the election to the president’s post. The election will be kept suspended till the court decides on the matter.”
