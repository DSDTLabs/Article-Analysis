NASHIK: While Prime Minister   and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis are requesting party leaders and officer bearers of the   (BJP) to refrain from nepotism, three   and an office-bearer of the party are lobbying for tickets for their family members in the upcoming civic polls.

 The official list of aspirants wanting to contest the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections on BJP ticket is likely to be made public on Friday. Macchindranath, the son of the city BJP MLA and city unit chief Balasaheb Sanap is in the race for a ticket to fight from Panchavati.
 
 Rashmi Bendale, daughter of BJP MLA Seema Hiray, is keen to contest the NMC elections from   area. The third aspirant is Himgauri Aher-Adke. He is cousin of BJP MLA Dr Rahul Aher from Chandwad and is seeking ticket from CIDCO region.
 
 Similarly Prathamesh, son of BJP office-bearer Vasant Gite, is also an aspirant from Mumbai Naka area.
 
 “The party officials are under pressure to approve the tickets of all these four aspirants,” said a BJP officer-bearer.
 
 “The party had contested alone in the elections last time and the tickets were freely distributed to everybody. This time the party has received 10 applications for one seat. But kin of the BJP heavyweights do have an additional weightage for obvious reasons. It would not be surprising if the party decide to give them tickets,” he added.
 
 However, the city BJP president denied that any of the BJP leaders are lobbying for tickets. “The fate of all aspirants would be decided in a non-partisan manner by party officials. The young faces are keen to contest the polls on BJP ticket,” Sanap said.
