THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government's decision to withdraw the email snooping case is likely to come as a setback to the police department, which had removed former   of hi-tech cell   from the service for his alleged involvement in the case, on disciplinary grounds.

 Biju was dismissed on charges of forgery and leaking of classified documents from the hi-tech crime inquiry cell, where he was working while the event that led to the case occurred. In the statement of facts that was furnished before the   (KAT) by the police department, accessed by TOI, it was stated that   had secretly taken photocopies of classified documents, forged a letter in the name of ADGP (intelligence) and also had forged the signature of SP, internal security.
 
 “At that point of time, the copies of classified documents would wrongly establish that the police were inter cepting e-mails of Muslims, including politicians and journalists. This would have strained communal feelings and would have damaged the communal harmony in the state leading to dire consequences,“ the statement of facts said.
 
 After being charged with Sections including 120B and 153A of the   for conspiracy and trying to create communal divide, the police department had initiated disciplinary proceedings against the officer, and an order was issued on January 7, 2015, termi nating him from the service. He approached the KAT against the decision. The government disposed his review petition through another order on June 20, 2016, with the findings that the punishment of removal from the service awarded by the disciplinary authority is commensurate to the charges levelled against the applicant.
 
 With the decision of the government to withdraw the case, its own stand vindicating the removal of the officer is likely to be challenged, sources said.
