VISAKHAPATNAM: Seven years after the gruesome murder of a 20-year-old girl in Atchutapuram, the accused was sentenced to life imprisonment by the 13th additional district judge court in   recently. 

 The accused Putta Kanaka Rao had promised a job to the deceased   alias   and eventually developed a relationship with her. However, superstition led him to believe that luck would favour him and he would get Rs 50 lakh if Kanaka Rao strangled Anusha to death with a ‘magical’ rope.
 
 In November 2010, Kanaka Rao killed Anusha with the help of two accomplices and left the body near   in Atchutapuram. He also tried to blackmail her parents and extract money. However, they lodged a complaint with the One Town police following which Rao was traced through phone calls and arrested in January 2011. But he was released on bail.
 
 “Additional public prosecutor   conducted the prosecution and Kanaka Rao was charged with murder and tampering with evidence. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his two accomplices were released due to lack of evidence,” said senior advocate Kuppili Muralidhar.
