NEW DELHI: The   earlier this week asked the   and the authorities concerned to explore the possibility of allotting land for a minority school which had been functioning from tents since its demolition over forty years ago during the  .

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar asked the Delhi chief secretary to coordinate and hold meetings with all the agencies, including DDA and the municipal body to find out land for the school.
 
 The court expressed concern after it was informed that the minority school had been functioning from tents and sought to know the status and the outcome of the meeting on the next date of hearing on December 12.
 
 The court’s directions were issued during hearing of a PIL seeking reconstruction of the building of the minority school. Filed by social activist Firoz Bakht Ahmed, the plea contended that the state of affairs at the Qaumi School is “sad and pitiable” as it was functioning from the grounds of the Eidgah at Quresh Nagar in Old Delhi.
 
 Citing the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, the petitioner emphasised that the Delhi government is obliged to provide land and building for the poor students of Qaumi School which was constructed post Partition using funds arranged by Muslims, who had decided to stay back in India rather than going to Pakistan.
 
 In 2015, AAP government had informed the court that they were keen to resolve the issue and were exploring all possibilities for allotting the land.
 
 Ahmed complained that despite promises of land and building, nothing was done and the school continued to function in a “tattered, tented and tinned structure, without a building”.
 
 “A hostile and inclement environment can hardly be conducive for learning. With competition in board examinations reaching stupendous proportions, children from such schools are placed at a huge disadvantage from the very inception of their schooling life,” argued Ahmed.
