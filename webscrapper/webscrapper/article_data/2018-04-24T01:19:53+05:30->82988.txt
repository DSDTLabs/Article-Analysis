NEW DELHI: Taking   to   of Delhi and Haryana   each other for the ongoing   on sharing of  , the Supreme Court on Monday directed them to sit together with secretary of Water Resources Ministry of Centre to sort out their differences.

 In compliance of the apex court’s order, chief secretaries of the two states personally appeared before a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta and raised their grievances of water-sharing and their differences on the minutes of a meeting held earlier.
 
 Additional solicitor general A N S Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre, also raised objection to failure of two top bureaucrats of the states to amicably resolve their differences and pleaded the court to grant them another opportunity to sit together to sort out the issue. “They should have sorted out themselves instead of making allegations in court. They should sit together and sort out the problem,” he said.
 
 The ASG said the chief secretaries can sit with Union water resources secretary to sort out dispute on Yamuna water- sharing. Agreeing with the ASG’s proposal, the court asked them to sit together and talk in a “cordial” atmosphere and come out with an amicable solution by April 27.
 
 The Haryana government also assured the court that it would continue to supply water to the national capital and the amount of water would not be reduced till the next date of hearing on April 27.
 
 The court was hearing a plea filed by Delhi Jal Board accusing the Haryana government of disobeying the apex court’s 1996 order directing the state to release 450 cusecs of Yamuna water daily to Delhi for drinking purposes. The Board told the bench that Delhi was facing an acute water crisis owing to shortage in supply of water by Haryana and pleaded the court to intervene.
