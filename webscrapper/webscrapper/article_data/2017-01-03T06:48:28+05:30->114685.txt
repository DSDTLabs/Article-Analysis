PUNE: Wheat and sugar cane byproducts will now be used for   as the  .

 Over five crore state school textbooks will now be printed using agricultural waste products. 
 
 The  , popularly known as Balbharati, has decided that this new environmentally-friendly process will begin from the 2017-18 academic year. The bureau will scrap the use of wood-based paper made out of tree pulp for printing textbooks.
 
 A professor from Nagpur, Arvind Sovani, had filed a petition in the high court in October stating that the pulp paper used by Balbharati to publish textbooks was not eco-friendly and that they should be using more eco-friendly ways of printing text books. 
 
 The court ordered Balbharati in November to stop the tender process and issue a fresh one for environment-friendly paper.
 
 Based on this court order, Balbharati decided to use agro-waste based pulp to make paper for printing nearly 10 crore text books.  , director of Balbharati stated, “We have issued an all-India level tender to procure agro-waste based pulp paper. Textbooks, including the cover page of every book, will be printed using this paper following court orders.”
 
 Magar added that the bureau requires 30,000 tonnes of paper every year to print the textbooks. Balbharati has so far been using ‘virgin pulp paper’ for printing textbooks and Sovani, in his petition, stated that this paper was hazardous to the environment and not eco-friendly since it required cutting of trees.
 
 Considering the number of textbooks printed every year by Balbharati and the virgin paper used for printing, there was a lot of damage done to environment, Sovani said in the petition. Magar said, “We would be using the agro-waste based paper from wheat and sugar cane waste from the 2017-18 academic year itself.” 
 
 Currently, the books are available in eight languages — Marathi, English, Hindi, Urdu, Kannada, Telugu, Sindhi and Gujarati.
