 recently surprised her fans by doing a cover of City Of Stars from  . The interesting bit, though, was getting her husband and actor   to sing along with her. “It was scary… but eventually we did it,” guffaws Rahul, adding, “We both watched the film together and kept humming the song for over a week. She then came up with the idea of doing a cover version. I had apprehensions as I didn’t want to make a fool of myself in public. But she promised that she would sit through the recording and help me out. Eventually, we recorded the song.” 

 Rahul elaborates about the recording, “It was quite simple, in the sense, a non singer like me can attempt singing this one. During the recording, I took a couple of re-takes until I was satisfied with my rendition. Chinmayi, too, guided me whenever I was going off-pitch.” And now, the actor has been receiving compliments for his rendition of the English number. “I have got a few opportunities to sing in my films but I didn’t take any of the offers as I wanted the professionals to their job. This is my first attempt in singing and I am glad that people like it. As of now, I haven’t been trolled on Twitter. And that’s big,” he laughs, adding, “However, I don’t aspire to sing in my films.”
