BHUBANESWAR: The   may have lost in Karnataka but its Odisha unit is living in hope, building its case on the same anti-incumbency factor that brought down the Siddaramaiah government. 

 "We know the   has been in power since 2000. But we can feel the anti-incumbency factor against the BJD. Just as we faced anti-incumbency in Karnataka, BJD will face the same in the 2019 election,"   president   said here. 
 
 Niranjan claimed the people in the state want change. "I have been touring across the state to attend party activities. I witnessed tremendous support for the Congress," Niranjan said.
 
 Despite suffering several electoral reversals, including the Bijepur assembly by-poll in February and last year's panchayat election, the Congress seems enthused after a change in leadership. All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Odisha, Jitendra Singh, who addressed a huge gathering of party workers in Khurda on Tuesday, claimed the party will do well in the state. "We should not equate the political situation in Karnataka with Odisha. The Congress has formed a new team to give a tough fight to the BJD," Jitendra said. 
 
 The ruling BJD, though, dismissed the anti-incumbency talk. "We do not think the Karnataka poll result will pose any threat to us. There is absolutely no threat to the incumbent government. People have been voting for the BJD because of the welfare schemes and pro-poor work undertaken by chief minister  ," BJD spokesperson Amar Satapathy said. 
 
 Some BJD leaders opined that the reason Naveen doesn't face anti-incumbency is because of his prompt action against leaders and public servants in the event of serious charges against them. 
 
 "We feel that his timely action against wrongdoings won the hearts of the people. Naveen would have felt anti-incumbency had he promoted illegalities or supported wrongdoers," a BJD leader said.
